<p> Dear Ruth,
<p> Sorry to be so late with my letter this week, dear,  but I&#8217;ve been sort of waiting to hear from you, guess maybe you didn&#8217;t get to go down to the Ranch for my last letter. Also been waiting until my plans were more definite. I suppose you know by now that Iris is coming home. I think she and I will drive back together- Mark is leaving for Guantanamo Bay (Cuba) on or about Sept 28- only a month, much to my sorrow and will be gone for at least 6 months and maybe a year or two years. Hence my decision to come home- not that I don&#8217;t want to come- I do, but wish that we could be going together- also dread the thought of leaving M. for so long. So I think now Iris and I will start back about Oct. 1. Since I haven&#8217;t been driving very long we will have to take it in slow stages and as long as we arrive in Alameda by the 16th everything will be O.K. I think I&#8217;ll try to get a job again at Cowell, and maybe you and I or all three of us can live somewhere in Oakland or Berkeley. I simply can&#8217;t picture myself sitting around home doing nothing- Mark doesn&#8217;t like the idea of me working again but I told that since he hadn&#8217;t provided me with any childcare to keep me occupied, I&#8217;d have to do something. I&#8217;ll have the car, so maybe it won&#8217;t be so bad- we should have some fun eh? This isn&#8217;t awfully definite yet, so don&#8217;t count to much on it- I really don&#8217;t know what else I can do, so I may as well come home. If Iris and I come together it will cost us both a lot less, and will be more fun.
<p> She was down here last weekend, and although we couldn&#8217;t offer her anything fancy in the way of entertainment it was lot&#8217;s of fun. She leaves tomorrow for a week&#8217;s trip to Boston- so I must send her a card and tell her not to make any definite plans about getting tickets home yet. I still have to get a license, but both Mark and Red seem quite confident about my driving. 
<p> Mark has the duty tonight- Red and I went to the show and saw &#8220; I love you again&#8221;. It was wonderful. We go to the show nearly every nite- doesn&#8217;t cost us anything- saw &#8220; They Drive By Nite&#8221; last evening. For the last 45 minutes Red and I have been in a drug store trying to call his wife. She is coming down this weekend to stay until the fellows leave. I will surely be glad to see her- I get so lonely here all day. It&#8217;s not so bad when the boys come home for lunch, but today they didn&#8217;t come. I really died of loneliness. I don&#8217;t know a soul here (letter was mailed from Quantico, Va. [HML] ) and no one has even called on us.
<p> Mark borrowed $100.00 from the bank last week and we got new tires for the car and day before yesterday I bought a sewing machine from Monkey Warde in Fredericksburg- only cost $41.95, haven&#8217;t got it yet. 
<p> Can&#8217;t seem to think of much more to say, nothing much happens here- this surely is a dead town. Don&#8217;t know what I would do if I didn&#8217;t have Sandy to talk to. 
<p> Please give my love to Aunt Learie and Uncle Russel- and loads of love to you- Received 2 cards from Mom- one from Tahoe and one from Yellowstone-
<p> Bye now, Lois
