Just before your letter arrived my dear Henry Custis came into my room & said, that Capt White told him there was a very nice room in the new building just purchased by the College which you could occupy with 2 other young men who are to study for the Ministry at a trifling expense. The greatest would be the furnishing it, still as that would divided among 3 it would not be so much & I write now to tell you of this arrangement that you might bring you sheets & blankets, towels etc which would save the necessity of buying them I may be able to lend you a bedstead & mattress However you can see about that when you come & as our house will not be so full then as it (Page 2) has been, though we shall still have a good deal of company you might come here, tho' if you wish to make a visit at the Pendletons, in the uncertainty of our state perhaps it would be as well for you to go there first Custis thinks you would be more comfortable & independent in this arrangement & come & take your meals with us, you could make arrangements for your study better - This plan we adopted with Carters sons who have been here & Custis & I will do all in our power to aid you I should not have written again as I said but thought you might like to bring those sheets etc In great haste yours affectly
