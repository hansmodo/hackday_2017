Our old tub has been rolling in a manner making it difficult to write. On Monday a fair wind came up which increased to a gale towards evening when we "lay to" under "bare poles," except the "main topsail" which was "closereefed." With contrary winds so that we could not make an inch on our course, we lay to in sight of another vessel,
supposed to be a man-of-war, bound on the same course as ourselves. It was a consolation to know we were not wholly alone in our glory! Being off Cape Horn, about sixty miles to the southeast, it was determined to celebrate the event in a suitable manner; the punch bowl and "old apple-jack" had to suffer in consequence and a right jovial night was had. Many had to be put to bed; one became raving and had to be tied down; some spouted, others swore, others again fell into the meal barrel and had to be helped out. The scenes were perfectly similar in character to the close of an election or some such event. And thus was celebrated the event of being off the Horn and it will not be forgotten in a day. The party kept up until near daylight. Many were rather worse for the frolic and spent the next day in bed.

The sea became in a measure quieted. However, on Tuesday we rolled too much to have the table set at dinner, each man taking his pork and bread in his hand and practicing on the motto that fingers were made before forks. After dark the wind rose again and snow fell in heavy squalls. We saw a large whale under the stern of the ship while the waves were dashing around us. Some played checkers, while the ladies favored us with several good songs and among the best, "Home Sweet Home."

Three vessels came in sight, one of which we spoke on Wednesday, the whaler Edward, of New Bedford, Massachusetts; while one of the others hoisted her colors and thus let us know she was American. They each carried considerably more sail than we have heretofore. To be even, our Captain ordered the canvas to be set, and we have made good time. It appears that we outsailed all the vessels, which is the first occurrence of the kind, and has raised the Europe's reputation at
least twenty per cent in the view of the passengers. The announcement that we would soon be in the Pacific was hailed with delight by all. This afternoon we passed the meridian of Cape Horn and are now gaily floating on the blue waters of the Pacific, just one hundred days from Philadelphia. I bet a bottle of brandy with Mr. Yard that we were not more than 7,000 miles from Philadelphia, the brandy to be taken at Valparaiso. We left the decision to the Captain and he decided in my favor.

We have not seen a paper since leaving the States, and hence we know nothing of what has occurred during that time at home or abroad. The whole earth might be revolutionized and we would be none the wiser; and the prospect is that we will have but little opportunity of knowing much for some time to come.

A distribution of the balance of the money in the hands of the President, from the contribution at New Castle, Delaware, took place, the dividend amounting to 23 cents to each member. A few gonies and numerous Cape pigeons have followed us entirely round the "Horn." This evening the barometer indicates an approaching storm.
