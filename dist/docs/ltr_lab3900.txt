SIR: 
</p><p>
Though I have not the honor of a personal acquaintance with you, I 
am now under the necessity of humbly addressing you in this manner in behalf of the parish and regiment I have the honor to represent and 
command a people that have ever stood foremost among those, by their 
inflexible attachment to their country; suffered many capital distresses, 
nor did not despair of success in our greatest extremity. Although 
we have so long been at such a distance from the enemy's lines, and 
suffering every murder, plundering and cruelty, that could be perpetrated by a banditti of the most desperate villains and mulattoes, immediately bordering on our settlements, we have, on all occasions, turned 
out, and kept in Gen. Marion's camp equal numbers with any in his 
brigade. Part of those who were under a truce that have not surrendered, and many other villains in this part of the country, that still 
continue their outrage, render the lives and property of the good citizens very unsafe; and this disorder, in all probability, must continue, 
and the re-establishment of good order and civil law hindered, except 
you, in your goodness, will indulge my regiment with a sufficient guard 
to the gaol, as it is insufficient of its use ; with orders for supplies of 
provisions for that and the poor inhabitants; an armed party to detect 
and bring to punishment the refractory and disobedient, which my 
warm desire for that purpose will induce me to engage to have punctually performed, with all due moderation, for the good of this country, 
and agreeably to any instructions you may think proper to give me, 
which I could do, and keep one-fourth on the field on common occasions, and on extraordinary emergencies with cheerfulness turn out one-half. My feelings will not let me omit mentioning to you some characters among them of Mr. Ganey's truce men, who have been received 
by Gen. Marion as citizens, and are now doing military duty, and en 
joying equal privileges with your best soldiers and citizens, who have 
borne the burden and heat of the day. Such I mean as were meant to 
be exempted by an Act of the late General Assembly at Jacksonborough 
men who have burned, plundered, and in cold blood (after many of 
our worthiest men had surrendered as prisoners of war) in the most 
ignominious and cruel manner taken their lives, particularly Col. Abel Robb s, my worthy predecessor, and a gentleman formerly a member of 
the Assembly, a Justice of the Peace, a good officer and a useful citizen, and capital loss to this part of the country; and the very villains 
that perpetrated this wanton, horrid murder, burning and plundering, 
are now, in the face of his distressed family and friends, received and 
restored to equal privileges with the men who have suffered everything 
by them that it was in their power and savage disposition to inflict. 
I am, sir, your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=lab" rel="me">LAMB BENTON</a>, Lieut.- Col Com. Cheraw Militia.

N. B. Your answer and instructions I shall hope to receive by the 
bearer, Mr. Vinow, in regard to the above. I do not doubt but Gen. Marion will acquiesce to it, as I mentioned the matter to him not long 
since, about provisions, men and ammunition. 
</p><p>
If you will be so kind as to furnish us with the militia laws, passed 
by the last Assembly, it will be of singular service, and the people and 
myself will be instructed.
