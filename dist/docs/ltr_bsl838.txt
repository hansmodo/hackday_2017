John L. Stephens , Esqr.
</p><p>
Dr. Sir,
</p><p>
I take advantage of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Gov. Fremont's</a> dispatch to address you for the second time only owing to want of certain communications. My tour from New York has been one wild adventure with all the changes of an ardous trip, intermingled with some pleasures and instruction.
</p><p>
May 10, 1846, we left the rendezvous on Indian Creek, 25 miles west of Independence. Colonel Russell (late marshall of state of Missouri) was voted the command of the party in opposition to Ex-Gov. Boggs (same state). Captain Kuykendall of Santa Fe, New Mexico expedition was appointed 1st Lieut. Mr. Curry , assistant editor of the St. Louis Reveille, aid, and myself quartermaster. Sixty nine waggons comprised our company. With the exception of Col. Russell's mess & our own, they were all families. Edwin Bryant Esqr., cousin of W.C. Bryant , R.T. Jacobs , son of wealthy John J. Jacobs, Louisville, & Col R. formed one mess of the bachelors. Francis Powers Esqr. of Boston, Jefferson with whom I left New York, & myself the other; after three days journey we kicked Jefferson out of the company which I never regretted afterward, although at the time inclined to stay with him.
</p><p>
We had fitted out with a first rate wagon and six mules, with harness complete; others were all ox teams. On arriving at the Kansas river, we became discontented at the slow progress of the caravan & with one other waggon left the main body, our own pilot, to overtake an Oregon co. we heard was one week ahead. Our friends parted reluctantly with us. Not expecting to meet until in California, but it was ordered otherwise. We succeeded in joining the head company after traveling some 300 miles; occasionally meeting Kaw Indians to whom we gave tobacco & other trifles. Some Shoshonees we met returning from the Buffalo country loaded with meat for which we traded & gave in return beads, knives, etc. Mr. Powers & myself had the credit of being better fitted out than any waggons on the road and had the satisfaction of being associated with an amiable, pleasant companion, industrious & perserving who resembled E.H. Williams more than any individual I ever met.
</p><p>
At Phalen's Bluffs , on the south fork of the Platte, 17 head of horses & mules were stolen by the Pawnees , as grand a set of double refined horse thieves as the Prairies can produce. Here we were, our team broken up & 500 miles from nowhere, however, by dint of trade, we obtained one yoke of oxen which we put at the wheel--of our two mules left we put in advance.
</p><p>
A consultation was held, five individuals were selected to hunt for the lost animals, myself among the number. Imagine a gentleman, four in hand , ploughing the western prairie, although we met such a loss, the ludicrous appearance of Powers with a pair of reins in one hand & an ox goad in the other, could not but excite some merriment. Off started the wagons, leaving us to scout the adjacent prairies and hills with some four days of provisions. We separated in the heart of the Pawnee hunting grounds, three riding to the south & Mr. Burgess from S. Carolina & myself to steer due east, the course from which we had just come. We found the trail of our horses & followed it some 80 miles, until lost among Buffalo tracks. We would frequently ride within 10 feet of some old bull sunning himself under the lea of a sand hill, but a near approach to them was so frequent we ceased to notice them.
</p><p>
What an undertaking, roaming in a strange land in quest of a thieving band of Indians. The number we did not even think of amid barren & arid waste. The growth of which was the prickly pear and bitter worm wood, interspersed with a little grass sufficient to keep life in our animals & water! Several nights we camped near stagnant pools, the odor of which was loathsome. I can compare these pools to nothing but a barn yard puddle, trod & mixed up by buffalo. We may have landed in Arkansaw but for luckily striking the trail which I knew.
</p><p>
Quite an argument between Mr. Burgess & myself over which end of the trail to take--I finally convinced him & we turned our faces west again, unsuccessful in our hunt--exhausted with fatigue & provisions gone. We dismounted & drove our animals ahead of us. They became so tired. I succeeded in killing a fat Buffalo cow, from which we took sufficient to last us until we reached the waggons--Our companions, who had taken the other course, we had no knowledge of & finally the eighth day after leaving our company, we again found snugly camped on the north fork of the Platte & the others had returned to camp the like unsuccessful after 3 days search--we supposed the distance we had travelled about 300 miles.
</p><p>
One adventure is worth relating--while making for the grassy bottom of the Platte fast at night--we discoverd two Indians on the bank of the stream. We agreed to approach them & take them prisoners--supposing them to be armed with only bows & arrows--but the knaves saw us when about 300 yards from them--discharged a gun at Mr. Burgess & fled--I dismounted & took a crack at the devils, but did not hit--for fear of interception from a larger body in the night--we travelled fifteen miles farther & camped--
</p><p>
At Fort Laramie Powers & myself separated, he concluding to go to Oregon--I retained the wagon & cattle--he the mules & his share of provisions--in the states my trade would have been $75 the best bargain, but in the wilderness it was different. The mules were good pack animals for which he desired them. I loaned my waggon & cattle to an emigrant whose team was nearly exhausted & waggon broken down. With him I joined with now, no care, no trouble, hauling my trunks, ammunition, guns, harness, etc.
</p><p>
From this time on, no incident worthy of notice transpired, excepting the breaking up & forming of new companies. In the meantime, the rear companies had overtaken us--Russell resigned his control & with some 7 or 8 others packed through from Laramie--I stayed with the waggons, commenced trading in horses with mountain men & Souix Indians & found myself in possession of 7 head when we left Laramie--(my note book is some 600 miles from here, consequently dates I cannot remember).
</p><p>
On arriving at Bridger's trading post on the Black fork of the Rio Colorado of the west--we found Lansford W. Hastings author of a work on California & Oregon, who had discovered a nearer route by some 300 miles, by way of the Salt Lake & great desert leaving the old route & Fort Hall to the North. He succeeded in inducing 1/2 of the emigration to follow him, but his statements to me was so unsatisfactory, concerning the route that our company followed the old trail, knowing that was passable--the result showed after travelling at least 300 miles farther--we came in ahead, our teams in better order, our provisions now plenty.
</p><p>
Oh! the fishing, speckled trout & the salmon trout were my daily prey--with a yankee rod & reel I astonished the Hoosiers--a singular fact, not a trout to be taken in the streams east of the South pass, but in every brook in the west I caught trout--even Mary's or Ogdens river which sinks in the desert--running a meandering course of 300 miles--sometime flowing & again the bed entirely dry--even in such a stream I took trout weighing upwards of 3 pounds.
</p><p>
On the same stream, the Shoshonee Indians, a tribe of the Snakes, committed many depredations on the emigrants. Frquently shooting at the men & at night killing cattle. They drove off several head of our cattle, killing some & wounding others. At a meeting of our company, it was resolved to attack the devils, recover our cattle if we could & chasten them severely & accordingly our little army praraded, numbering 17 men all told, only two others & myself on horseback, 14 on foot. The Indians had possession of a large track of rushes very high and thick. Their number at the lowest estimate was put down at 150, but I am confident it was a tribe of 300 souls, who had placed themselves in that position to prey on the emigrants.
</p><p>
We sallied forth and came within long rifle shot. I was selected to fire the first shot. I chose my ground, fired, every man disappeared, supposed to have been hit. Upon which the well known Indian yell was raised & onward we rushed driving them before us. Our first charge resulted in our killing two Indians, on our side two men were wounded with arrows & one horse, our leader slightly wounded in the wrist. Upon consultation we resolved to charge, your humble servant then leading, which resulted in dislodging them from their stronghold, & forcing them to the hills & rocks. No loss on our side, 3 Indians wounded. Up to this time we had been fighting them some four hours. Our men elated with success, demanded again to be led on with a view to take some prisoners as hostages for their future good conduct--After driving about 50 of their warriors in the rocks we imprudently charged to within ten feet, and not less than 20 arrows were aimed at me alone--I escaped unhurt, but discharged "Yucatan" well loaded with buckshot in their faces.
</p><p>
We drew back about 30 yards from the redskins & opened a sure fire on them killing four more, but during the action, a Mr. Wm. P. Sallee of St. Louis, a brave, cool & determined Gentleman, received a mortal wound, of which he died 3 days after, and so keen were the devils to kill him that no less than four arrows pierced him at the same time& his horse was also killed under him. Nor did I escape a slight token of their regard.
</p><p>
I had dismounted and exchanged "Yucatan" for a rifle with which I was operating. I had successfully dodged all their arrows, when a gun to my right bursted which drew my eye for a moment from the foe who took advantage of the opportunity and shot me through the right leg below the knee cap. It struck the bone, pierced thru beneath the sinew & there was I, most beautifully feathered--I immediately grasped the barbed point that protruded & drew the arrow its length through to which I attribute my quick recovery, the feathers wiping out all poisonous matter from the wound. 14 days from [then] I hobbled out on a pair of crutches made of willow & an old ox bow & 6 days from that threw them aside & have felt no inconvenience from the wound since, save when exposed & drenched with rain. Some 8 or 10 days previous to my arrival at <a href="/results.php?tla=jas" rel="">Sutter's</a> Fort, I was taken ill with the camp fever, of which after two weeks sickness I recovered.
</p><p>
From <a href="/results.php?tla=jas" rel="">Sutter's</a> Fort on the Sacramento, I started down that beautiful river, across the bay of [San] Francisco to Yerba Buena on the south side--Here I hired a boat, invested my funds in Groceries, & returned to <a href="/results.php?tla=jas" rel="">Sutter's</a> Fort, sailing the boat myself to trade with the emigrants. Being engaged ten days in which time with my small capital I cleared $107. The next 3 weeks I was traveling from one part of the Bay to another always with goods, trading for hides & produce, at the expiration of that time, <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Fremont</a> & his little army started for lower [southern] California to quell an insurrection broken out there, Messrs Jacobs & Bryant whom I before mentioned had raised a company of Tule Indians , wrote me desiring that I would join them. Col. Russell obtained for me a commission under <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Fremont</a>, Jacob, Captain, Bryant & myself Lts. of the Indians. We left the head of the Bay--joined <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Col. Fremont</a> 120 miles at the mission of St. Johns There we commenced a memorable campaign. One which could only have been conducted by our indefatigable leader.
</p><p>
On our arrival at Sutter's Fort, the American Flag was flying & on my arrival at Yerba Buena it was there waving. The U.S. Sloop of War Portsmouth, <a href="/results.php?tla=jbm" rel="">Capt. Montgomery</a>, the Warren, Capt. Hull, & the Savannah, Capt. Mervin were lying in port with some seven or 8 merchantmen & whalers.
</p><p>
The Bay exceeds any port or harbor I ever saw & the present site of (good herb) is well adapted for a commercial location. <a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="">Com. Stockton</a> in the Congress had sailed the day before for Lower California, where <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Fremont</a>--who was then raising volunteers from the Emigrants, was to cooperate with [him]. <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Fremont</a> had already been made Governor by <a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="">Stockton</a> & a civil Government was being formed when this revolution commenced which brought out the present array.
</p><p>
On the Salinas Plains near <a href="/results.php?city=monterey">Monterey</a>, a company of 54 Americans under Burrows were attacked by 165 (Spainards) Californians. The Americans with their awful weapons, the rifle, defeated the enemy with the loss of three men killed. Among the rest the brave Burrows. The loss of the Californians as I was informed by <a href="/results.php?tla=tol" rel="colleague">Thomas O. Larkin</a>, our former consul, who was a prisoner at the time & necessarily a spectator, stated their loss at 16 killed & wounded, our company did not join the main body till after this fight. Our reception at Camp by <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Col. Fremont</a> was gratifying; from the first days march we were made the advance guard & retained that position until we entered this City of the Angels, whimsically so called by <a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="">Com. Stockton</a>--a batch of adobe houses covering an area of a mile square with some 900 inhabitants.
</p><p>
I was freqently detached by the Col.--with a foraging troop & was successful [in] capturing horses & frequently prisoners. Our passage across the St. Barbara Mountain with four pieces of heavy artillery was a bold & glorious achievement and entitled our noble leader to the praise of his countrymen. At the Rencon (or corner) where the mountains run into the sea & only low tide could we pass was also another daring exploit. The schooner, Julia Ann (a prize) with two guns was sent at this point to cooperate, but the Californians deserted their posts & fled still further south. At the Mission of Buenaventura we gave them two shots from our long gun, but here they again dispersed. At this place news reached us of the arrival of <a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="">Gen. Kearny</a> with 500 Dragoons--Also that the great I Am, so called here, was advancing with 700 marines & sailors from the Congress and the Cyane.
</p><p>
The California Gen. Flores had challenged <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Fremont</a>. Here we were only 400 strong, advancing towards an enemy 1600 strong & the best horsemen in the world. But Flores, having a more contemptable opinion of the marines & sailors than he had of riflemen, judiciously attacked the Commodore on the 8th of January, but withdrew after sustaining considerable loss. On the 9th they again attacked the Co. who how had formed a juncture with <a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="">Gen. Kearny</a> with his 500 dragoons, but was defeated with the loss of 60 killed and wounded. The Comd. loss was but 3 killed & wounded. This victory enabled <a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="">Stockton</a> to take this place. He entered the Town four days before our arrival; the Spainards, however, would not surrender to him, they capitulated with our leader & surrendered their armies. <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Col. Fremont</a> is again Gov. <a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="">Com. Stockton</a> has marched to Santiago on the coast & <a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="">Gen. Kearny</a> to San Pedro.
</p><p>
It appears <a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="">Kearny</a> arrived here with instructions to conquer the country & institute a civil government, his orders from Government were dated the 6th of last June, <a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="">Stockton</a> was invested with the same power, only of prior date. <a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="">Stockton</a> contended he had conquered the country & appointed a Govr. & neither <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Fremont</a> nor <a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="">Stockton</a> did recongnise <a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="">Kearny's</a> authority, no doubt you will see accounts in the papers at length, as I know communications have been forwarded from here to the press.
</p><p>
Col. Russell is Sec of State & a council of 3 Americans & 2 natives been appointed to put our laws in execution. They are appointed by the Gov. for this and next year, after that the election goes to the people. Capt Jacob returned to the states via Panama. E. Bryant than whom a more sterling man never lived, returns by the mountains. He has been taking notes, intends publishing his work as soon as he can, of his arrival at the states & from the war. I say a better account of the country will not be necessary.
</p><p>
I am now asst. Qtrmaster, holding my comn. still of Lt. Both officers have gone, a part of the Battalion disbanded, but the Indians still here and under my control.
</p><p>
Not an idle day has passed since I arrived in Cala. & to you again I do return sincere thanks for the opportunity in launching out on the rough seas of life. Should it meet your approbation & you wish to start one of your nephews to this country, a certain and sure competency await any individual who would now invest money in anything. Whether you contemplate such an adventure now, I know not--
</p><p>
Vehicles selling at home from 80 to 100 is worth 400 to $500--machines thrashing, cornshellers, mining or cradling machines 200 percent above cost & charges can be realized. Dry goods of all kinds, hardware, in fact, the country is destitute of all merchandise.
</p><p>
I have in my possession an article from <a href="/results.php?tla=tol" rel="colleague">Thomas O. Larkin</a>, former consul and the best merchant in the country, guaranteeing to raise & put in my possession $4,000 which amount I am to invest in goods at the Sandwich Islands. The appointment of Asst. Qmaster has been offered me. But I wish only to remain in employ temporarily. <a href="/results.php?tla=tol" rel="colleague">Mr. Larkin</a> is above; he expects to be here soon in the Hawaiian Barque, Don Quixote, Commander Paty, with whom I sail for the Island.
</p><p>
My letter of introduction has been of the utmost importance to me. At once being made acquainted with all the prominent business men of the country. The amount due me from Government & funds & property on hand amounts to not one cent less than 900 Dol. <a href="/results.php?tla=tol" rel="colleague">Mr. Larkin</a> is now building a large store and warehouse at Yerba Buena which will be open for a produce & Genl. Assortment Store. I have secured two lots in the town, the seat of Government at present or for the time is located here, but will be removed north after this session.
</p><p>
California is all that I expected, both as regards soil and grazing purposes but for an agricultual country it is not well adapted. Some rich mines of Lead & Silver have been discovered & mining operations will commence soon as the Govnt. is throughly settled. The resources of this country are immense, but under the control of the natives never would have been brought out. Now the Anglo-Saxon race predominating, everything looks up & even the lazy indolent Spaniard who before thought work a disgrace will be sure striving to earn, if fact they must work now or the Yankee will root them out & soon have their property.
</p><p>
The express by which I forward this starts in the morning, with the noted Kit Carson, <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Gov. Fremont's</a> guide as bearer of dispatches. I would write E.H.W. Mother, or some of the boys but must defer it until I arrive at the Sandwich Islands. I am very desireous to hear from home, to receive any papers or news would be very acceptable. When you hear from me again, I shall be some 600 miles north doing business with all to gain & not much to lose. <a href="/results.php?tla=jds" rel="">Commodore Sloat</a> left the coast before my arrival, consequently your friend's kind letter is still in my possession. With respects & remembrance to all I conclude, hoping you may enjoy the same blessing "health" I now have. Remember me affectionately to all your family & to my good mother. Send her word that Ben is trying to do well.
</p><p>
Affectionately,<br/>
