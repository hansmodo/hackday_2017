The weather here is not very cold and we seldom have frost or ice. Most of the trees are covered with green foliage, and the hills and valleys are carpeted with new grass.

Atkins has left Sonora and gone to some new diggings, known as Cherokee Camp, about fifteen miles from this place. I accompanied him on his journey and spent the night in the camp. We were quietly stretched out on our blankets around the fire, swapping yarns with some gentlemen whose tents were close by. Suddenly we heard footsteps, as of some person stealthily approaching. As we listened, the sound grew more and more distinct and we became convinced that a number of men were stealing in upon us. As it was dark and therefore impossible to espy the intruders, each one of us quickly drew his revolver, being always on guard against marauders. But before we could fire, two colorfully dressed señoritas tripped out of the darkness into the camp. They had come out for a serenade, and proceeded to sing many merry songs, accompanying their fine voices with music picked from their guitars. A part of the entertainment consisted of a fandango, and the dance was much enjoyed by the men participating. They had become quite boisterous in their enthusiasm.

But the merry music changed, and the señoritas played softly on their guitars the sweet strains of "Home, Sweet Home," bringing to the hearts of these
sturdy men the familiar words of the song, and thoughts of friends and home. Suddenly a sob was heard, followed by another, and yet another, and tears flowed freely down the cheeks of the gold diggers. Pieces of gold were generously tossed into the tambourine held out to receive them.

    'mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,<br/>
    Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home!<br/>
    A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,<br/>
    Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.
