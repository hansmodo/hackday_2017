Sir, 
</p><p>
I am extremely sorry to have embarrassed you 
by my late application, and that you should think 
there are insuperable obstacles to a compliance with 
it. Having renounced my expectations, I have no 
other inducement for troubling your Excellency with 
a second letter, than to obviate the appearance of 
having desired a thing inconsistent with the good of 
the service, while I was acquainted with the circumstances which made it so. 
</p><p>
I was too interested a spectator of what happened 
in the case of Major Macpherson, not to have remarked and not to recollect all the circumstances. 
The opposition turned ostensibly on his being a Brevet Officer, yet having a command in a corps formed 
entirely from one line. The propriety of his being 
employed in a detachment from the army at large, 
so far as I remember, was not disputed. In delicacy 
to Major Macpherson, no personal objections were formally made ; but in reality they existed, and contributed to the discontent. It was thought a peculiar 
hardship, that a gentleman who had for a long time 
fought against us, and had not taken part with us 
till a late period, and when our affairs had assumed 
a more prosperous aspect, should he preferred in one 
of the most honorary commands of the service. Your 
Excellency must be convinced that I mention this in 
no other view than to show the sentiments of the 
officers at the time, and the whole grounds of the 
opposition. My esteem for Major Macpherson, and 
other reasons, make it impossible I can have a different intention. 
</p><p>
I know less of the motives of dissatisfaction in the 
cases of Colonel Gimat and Major Gal van; but I have 
understood that it is founded on their being appointed in the light corps for two successive campaigns. 
</p><p>
It would be uncandid in me not to acknowledge 
that I believe a disposition to exclude Brevet Officers, in general, from command, has a great share in 
the opposition in every instance, and that, so far, it 
affects my case. But, at the same time, it appears 
to me, this principle, alone, can never be productive 
of more than momentary murmurs, when it is not 
seconded by some plausible pretext. I also am convinced that the Pennsvlvania officers, for their own 
sakes, repented the rash steps the} had taken, and, 
on cool reflection, were happy in an opportunity 
to relinquish their menaces of quitting a service to 
which they were attached by habit, inclination, and 
interest, as well as by patriotism. I believe, too, we 
shall never have a similar instance in the army, unless the practice should be carried to excess. Major Galvan, I am told, will probably be relieved. Colonel Gimat will then be the only Brevet Officer remaining 
in command. Your Excellency is the best judge of the proper limits ; and there can be no doubt that 
the rights of particular officers ought to give place 
to the general good and tranquillity of the service. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear repeating that my case is peculiar, and dissimilar to all the former. It is distinguished by the circumstances I have before intimated. My early entrance into the service ; my 
Laying made the campaign of <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, the most disagreeable of the war, at the head of a company of 
artillery, and having been entitled, in that corps, to 
a rank equal in degree, more ancient in date, than I 
now possess ; my having made all the subsequent campaigns in the family of the Commander-in-chief, in a 
constant course of laborious and important service; â€” 
these are my pretensions, at this advanced period of 
the war, to being employed in the only way which 
my situation admits ; and I imagine they would have 
been weighty in the minds of the officers in general. 
I only urge them, a second time, as reasons which 
will not suffer me to view the matter in the same 
light with your Excellency, or to regard as impracticable my appointment in a light corps, should there 
be one formed. I entreat they may be understood 
in this sense only. I am incapable of wishing to 
obtain any object by importunity. 
</p><p>
I assure your Excellency that I am too well persuaded of your candor, to attribute your refusal to 
any other cause than an apprehension of inconveniences that may attend the appointment. I have the 
honor to be, with perfect respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. I have used the term Brevet in the sense 
your Excellency appears to have understood it, as signifying, in general, all officers not attached to any 
established corps. Congress seem, however, to have 
made a distinction ; they only give a kind of warrant to those whom they designate as Brevet Officers. 
Mine is a regular commission.
