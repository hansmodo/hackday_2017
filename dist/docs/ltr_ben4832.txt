DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
There is lately published in Paris a Work intitled ZendAvesta, Outrage de Zoroastre, contenant les I dees Theologiques, Physiques, et Morales, de ce Legislateur; les Ceremonies 
du Culte Religieux qu'il a etabli, et plusieurs Traits importans 
relatijs a PAneienne Histoire des Perses. Traduit en Fran$ois sur V Original Zend, avec des Remarques; et accompagne de plusieurs Traites propres a eclaircir les Matieres 
qui en sont V Ob jet. Par M. Anquetil du Perron, de PAcademie 
Royale des Inscriptions et Belles- Lettres, et Interprets du 
Roy pour les Langues Orientates. It is in two Volumes 4to. 
Near half the Work is an Account of the author's Travels in 
India, and his Residence among the Parses during several 
Years to learn their Languages.

I have cast my Eye over the Religious Part; it seems to 
contain a nice Morality, mix'd with abundance of Prayers, 
Ceremonies, & Observances. If you desire to have it, I will 
procure it for you. There is no doubt of its being a genuine 
Translation of the Books at present deem'd sacred as the Writings of Zoroaster by his Followers ; but perhaps some of 
them are of later Date tho' ascrib'd to him; for to me there 
seems too great a Quantity & Variety of Ceremonies & 
Prayers, to be directed at once by one Man. In the Romish 
Church they have increased gradually in a Course of Ages to 
their present Bulk. Those who added new ones from time 
to time found it necessary to give them Authority by Pretences of their Antiquity. The Books of Moses indeed, if 
all written by him, which some doubt, are an Exception to 
this Observation. With great Esteem, I am ever, Dear 
</p><p>
Sir, &c. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
</p><p>
Friend and hum Serv
