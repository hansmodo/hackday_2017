MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The enemy crossed the Ashley, in force, near the 
ferry, on the 29th ultimo, and the next day moved 
down, and encamped about three thousand .yards from 
our lines. Before this, they had transported their 
heavy baggage, ordnance, and stores, from out of 
Wappoo, across land, about two miles, to Old Town 
Creek, on the west side of the river, opposite their 
encampment. In the morning of the 1st instant, we 
discovered that they had opened ground in several 
places in our front, about eleven hundred yards there 
from. The next night they threw up a work on our left, distance nine hundred yards. The next which 
appeared was on Cooper River, six hundred yards 
from our right ; these, and some which they have 
since raised, seem to be closed. They have been some 
nights perfecting their works, and opening lines of 
communication. What they have done seems rather 
calculated to cover their approaches, than to annoy 
us from them. 
</p><p>
Seven ships of war passed Fort Moultrie yesterday 
afternoon, and anchored near where Fort Johnson 
stood, with no other apparent injury than the loss 
of one topmast. We have been busily employed in 
throwing obstructions in their passage of the Cooper. 
I wish they may prove effectual, for it is of the highest importance for us to keep that open ; thereby 
we preserve a communication with the country, from 
which we can draw our succours and supplies. In 
order the more effectually to do this, we mean to 
throw up a work on Lempriere's, one at Cainhoy up 
Wando, where we shall have our deposit of stores, 
besides some on the several landings, on the east 
side of Cooper River. These things have been some 
time in contemplation, but the necessary works to 
be made in town have prevented their being executed. Indeed, before the Virginia troops, under General Woodford, arrived, which was on the 7th, we could 
not man them; but from the addition of that force, 
and the North Carolina militia, who are coming in, 
we hope to spare some few men for this purpose, 
and that we shall be able to draw down some of the 
militia of this State into these works, who will not 
come to town. One of the enemy's ships, said to be a transport, fell to leeward last night (within Fort 
Moultrie), which ship they burned this morning. 
</p><p>
I expect soon the remainder of General Scott's 
troops, and some militia from North Carolina. I have 
the honor to be, my dear General, with the high esteem and affection, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
