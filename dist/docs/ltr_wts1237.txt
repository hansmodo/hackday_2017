Dear Brother : I was very glad to receive your full 
letter of November 9th, to hear that you are safely back 
at your <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> home, and take the recent election 
so philosophically. I wanted Foraker to succeed, because 
he was one of my young soldiers. He cannot be suppressed, and will turn up again. I think you are also 
wise in your conclusion to retire gracefully at the end 
of your present term. To be a President for four years 
is not much of an honor, but to have been senator continuously from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1861">1861</a> to 1892 less the four years as 
Secretary of the Treasury is an honor. Webster and 
Clay are better known to the world than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="">Polk</a> and Pierce. 
As to myself, I continue pretty much as always in universal demand for soldiers' meetings, college commencements, and such like things always with a promise 
that I will not be called on to speak, which is always 
broken worse still, generally exaggerated by reporters. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
