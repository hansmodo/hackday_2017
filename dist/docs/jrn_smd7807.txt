What a day! Last night came a dispatch that 
<a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> was under British protection, and could 
not be bombarded ; consequently, the enemy's gun 
boats would probably be here this morning, such few 
as had succeeded in passing the Forts; from nine to 
fifteen, it was said. And the Forts, they said, had 
not surrendered. I went to church; but I grew very 
anxious before it was over, feeling that I was needed 
at home. When I returned, I found Lilly wild with 
excitement, picking up hastily whatever came to 
hand, preparing for instant flight, she knew not 
where. The Yankees were in sight ; the town was to 
be burned; we were to run to the woods, etc. If the 
house had to be burned, I had to make up my mind 
to run, too. So my treasure-bag tied around my waist 
as a bustle, a sack with a few necessary articles hanging on my arm, some few quite unnecessary ones, too, 
as I had not the heart to leave the old and new prayer 
books father had given me, and Miriam's, too; 
pistol and carving-knife ready, I stood awaiting the 
exodus. I heaped on the bed the treasures I wanted 
to burn, matches lying ready to fire the whole at the 
last minute. I may here say that, when all was over, 
I found I had omitted many things from the holocaust. This very diary was not included. It would 
have afforded vast amusement to the Yankees. 
There may yet be occasion to burn them, and the 
house also. People fortunately changed their minds 
about the auto-da-fe just then ; and the Yankees have 
not yet arrived, at sundown. So, when the excitement calmed down, poor Lilly tumbled in bed in a 
high fever in consequence of terror and exertion.

I was right in that prophecy. For this was not the 
Will Pinckney I saw last. So woebegone! so subdued, 
careworn, and sad! No trace of his once merry self. 
He is good-looking, which he never was before. But 
I would rather never have seen him than have found 
him so changed. I was talking to a ghost. His was a 
sad story. He had held one bank of the river until 
forced to retreat with his men, as their cartridges 
were exhausted, and General Lovell omitted sending 
more. They had to pass through swamps, wading 
seven and a half miles, up to their waists in water. 
He gained the edge of the swamp, saw they were over 
the worst, and fell senseless. Two of his men brought 
him milk, and "woke him up," he said. His men fell 
from exhaustion, were lost, and died in the swamp; 
so that out of five hundred, but one hundred escaped. 
This he told quietly and sadly, looking so heart 
broken that it was piteous to see such pain. He 
showed me his feet, with thick clumsy shoes which an 
old negro had pulled off to give him ; for his were lost 
in the swamp, and he came out bare-footed. They 
reached the Lafourche River, I believe, seized a boat, 
and arrived here last night. His wife and child were 
aboard. Heaven knows how they got there! The 
men he sent on to Port Hudson, while he stopped 
here. I wanted to bring his wife to stay with us; but 
he said she could not bear to be seen, as she had run 
off just as she had happened to be at that moment. 
In half an hour he would be off to take her to his old 
home in a carriage. There he would rejoin his men, 
on the railroad, and march from <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> to the 
Jackson road, and so on to Corinth. A long journey 
for men so disheartened! But they will conquer in 
the end. <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel=''>Beauregard's</a> army will increase rapidly at 
this rate. The whole country is aroused, and every 
man who owns a gun, and many who do not, are on 
the road to Corinth. We will conquer yet.
