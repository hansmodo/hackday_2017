MY DEAR SIR: 
<p></p>
The news from the Parliament of Great Britain 
this morning must, I think, increase the discontents of 
our neighbors on the other side of the St. Lawrence 
and the lakes not a little ; and that those discontents 
may in a few years lead to a separation of the Canadas, 
New Brunswick, etc., etc., from England seems equally 
probable. 
<p></p>
Will those Provinces form themselves into an independent nation, or seek a connection with our Union ? 
I think the probability is greatly in favor of the latter. 
In my judgment the interests of both sides would be 
much promoted by annexation the several Provinces 
coming into the Union on equal terms with our present thirty States. The free navigation of the St. Law 
rence is already of immense importance to, perhaps, a 
third of our present population, and would be of great 
value to the remainder, 
<p></p>
After annexation, two revenue cutters below Quebec would give us a better security against smuggling 
than thirty thousand custom-house employes strung 
along the line that separates us from the British possessions on our continent. I am well acquainted with 
that line, and know a great deal about the interests 
and character of the Provincials. Though opposed to 
incorporating with us any district densely peopled with 
the Mexican race, I should be most happy to fraternize 
with our northern and northeastern neighbors. 
<p></p>
What may be the views of our Executive Government on the subject, I know absolutely nothing ; but I 
think I cannot err in saying that two thirds of our 
people would rejoice at the incorporation, and the other 
third soon perceive its benefits. 
<p></p>
Of course I am opposed to any underhanded measures on our part, in favor of the measure, or any 
other act of bad faith toward Great Britain. Her 
good will, in my view of the matter, is only second to 
that of the Provincials themselves, and that the for 
mer would soon follow the latter considering the pres 
ent temper and condition of Christendom cannot be 
doubted. 
<p></p>
The foregoing views I have long been in the habit 
of expressing in conversation. I give them to you for 
what they may be worth. 
<p></p>
Faithfully yours, 
<p></p>
