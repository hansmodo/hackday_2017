Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This letter will cover the state of my account with the United States, made up, on the first instant, agreeably to the instructions given by Mr Jefferson on that subject. No opportunity has since presented for the transmission. 
</p><p>
The bankers of the United States in Amsterdam wrote to 
me on the twentieth of June, that they have reason to apprehend, that it will be extremely difficult for them to supply me 
in future for the amount of my salary and expenses attending 
my mission. This arises from a law they have passed in 
Holland similar to the British statute, which prohibits the 
payment of funds belonging to those, who were in this country 
during a certain time. This same statute has, I understand, 
locked up my money in England ; but I have written on that 
subject to Mr Pinckney. I expect also that the Dutch ad 
ministration will except my drafts from their general system. 
</p><p>
In replying to this letter, M. Buchot observes ; I have made use 
of the suggestion, which you gave me respecting the supplies rendered 
by M. Beaumarchais to the United States during the last war, and I 
have communicated it to a suitable person to search for such proofs as 
may exist, as to the part of these supplies, which may have been taken 
from the magazines of France, and for which in such case this 
citizen is indebted to the Republic. 
</p><p>
If they do not, I must employ other resources. In this country, as you will have seen by my former letters, exchange is 
fixed at par. I have, however, in my account charged the 
value of sums paid at the time of payment, or rather carried 
to the credit of the United States the difference, as you will 
perceive. 
</p><p>
It is difficult, at present, to determine the value of Assignats compared with bullion. The sale of coin is prohibited 
on pain of death, so that no fixed course obtains. To judge 
by the prices of goods and provisions, bread excepted, the 
paper money is not worth above half its nominal amount, but 
the same articles are not to be obtained cheaper for hard money, 
and silver in bullion is by no means at double the former 
price. It has risen during the last spring from par to about a 
third advance, and is now perhaps something higher. 
</p><p>
I pray you will pay to Monsieur Nagot, the superior of the 
Catholic Seminary at Baltimore, or to Messieurs Chicoisneau, 
Tessier and Gamier, the directors thereof, the sum of two 
thousand four hundred and thirty dollars, and fifty-five cents, 
for which I have received the value here, and shall give credit 
therefor in my next account. I am, &c.
