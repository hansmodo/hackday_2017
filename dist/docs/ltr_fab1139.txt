We often talk about the family and Bucksport in our family circle, which consists of Cole and wife, Feast, Fagg and myself, and contrast our mode of life with that of yours. We generally come to the conclusion that we live
faster and better here. In the line of melons at this time we certainly lay over you. Watermelons that weigh from 30 to 40 lbs. and mushmelons in every variety. We devour from 4 to 6 per day, and mixed with beef, mutton and vegetables of all kinds. We are growing fat and enjoy perfect health.

Sarah and a number of the other ladies are engaged in a Sunday School. Our Court House and jail are finished and the morals of the place visibly improving.

Business is very dull and local news scarce. So much so that our correspondent of the Shasta Courier has suspended operations.

I heard from Howard Buck today. He is in a streak of luck this summer. He makes in his claim on the East Fork an average of $20 per day. On Cañon Creek rich diggings have been struck, also close to town in the top of a hill, $10 to the pan. When the canal now under construction, from Trinity River, is completed there will be 500 tons of water to work with which will give employment to several thousand men. At present water is very scarce. One ton head rents for $16 per week. This canal will be 28 miles long and cost $250,000, but there is no doubt but what the stock will pay 20% per month. As there are extensive diggings which cannot be worked for want of water, California is not worked out yet and the yield of gold about this place is much larger than last year. Next year I think the whole Trinity river will be flumed. A new road is to be put through from this place to Red Bluffs direct, shortening the distance twenty miles. Red Bluffs is at the head of navigation on the Sacramento and the place where we buy all our goods--distance 80 miles from this place.

So you see we are developing the country, spreading ourselves generally. Perhaps you had not better come out yet.

I have just taken a walk through town, visited all the saloons. It is Saturday night and they are crowded. We have four in operation, all carried on by French and Dutch. At present the Diana has a fine band of music but nothing of interest going on. They are a kind of Exchange for the miners to meet at and take a drink and play euchre and dance with the girls. Gambling is a small business, few bets exceeding a quarter. Sich is life in Weaverville.

Good night. Parting is such...etc.
