Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of receiving your Excellency's letter of the 6th instant only two hours ago. We are greatly indebted to the Chevalier Destouches for the 
disposition he shows to undertake the expedition to Penobscot, and to you for your readiness to furnish a 
detachment of troops for the same purpose. The object is certainly worthy of our attention, and if it 
can be effected will be very agreeable to the States, particularly to those of the east. M. Destouches can best judge, from the situation of the enemy's fleet, 
how far it may be attempted with prudence ; and your Excellency, from the information you have recently received, what number of troops will be sufficient for the enterprise. I am persuaded it will be 
calculated how far it is probable the enemy may follow with a part of their fleet ; whether the post can be 
carried by a coup de main, or may require so much time as to make it likely the operation will be interrupted before its conclusion, in case of a superior 
squadron being sent by the enemy ; and what possibility there is of protection, or a safe retreat for the 
ships, and even for the land force, through an unsettled country. All these points are too important not 
to have been well weighed, and your conversations 
with the Massachusetts deputies will have enlightened you upon them. 
</p><p>
The confidence I have in your judgment assures to you the concurrence of my sentiments, in whatever you 
may do on the occasion. I will only take the liberty to remark two things ; first, that it appears to mc frigates, without any ships of the line, will answer the purpose as well as with them, and less will be risked 
by dividing the body of the fleet. Frigates, including the forty-fours, will afford a safe escort to the troops against any thing now in those seas. With respect to 
a detachment from the enemy's fleet, it would always be proportioned to the force we should send. If we have two sixty-fours, they would even be an object 
for their whole fleet. Secondly, as despatch is essential to success, it will in my opinion be advisable not to depend on any cooperation of the militia, but to 
send at once such a force from your army, as you deem completely adequate to a speedy reduction of the post. 
</p><p>
The country in the neighbourhood of Penobscot is 
too thinly inhabited to afford any resource of militia 
there ; and to assemble and convey them from remote places would announce your design, retard your 
operations, and give leisure to the enemy to counteract you. Indeed, I would recommend, for the sake 
of secrecy, to conceal your determination from the 
State itself. These hints you will be pleased to make 
use of only so far as they appeal- to be well founded. 
I have the honor to be, &c.
