THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, November 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR : 
</p><p>
Yesterday I wrote a card to Mr. Van Hees, the agent 
of their High Mightinesses, requesting him to appoint a time 
when it would be convenient to him to receive a visit from 
me, and giving him notice of the commission and credentials 
which I have the honor to bear. He appointed an hour this 
morning, when I called accordingly, and desired him to in 
form me what measures I must take in order to obtain my 
reception. He told me the customary course was to pay 
a visit to the weekly president of their High Mightinesses, 
and deliver my credentials to him, who would on the same 
day communicate them to the States General, and they would pass a resolution to acknowledge me in the character 
with which I am vested. "But (added he) I must observe 
to you, Sir, that Mr. Short has not yet taken leave of their 
High Mightinesses." I told him that when Mr. Short went 
to Madrid it was under the expectation of returning here, 
but that the United States having further occasion for his 
services in Spain, the President had now appointed him to 
reside there ; that I had been the bearer of his letters of re 
call to their High Mightinesses, and had already sent them 
to him, as it was judged by the American government most 
consistent with propriety that they should be transmitted 
to the States General by himself. The Agent acquiesced 
in this idea, and said he believed there were some prece 
dents conformable to this mode of procedure. That I might 
therefore be immediately admitted and deliver Mr. Short's 
letters of recall, when I should receive them from him. 
</p><p>
He said it was also customary, immediately after deliver 
ing the credentials to the weekly president, to leave a copy of 
them with the Greffier ; but as he was now absent, the communication might be made to the Commis or clerk of their 
High Mightinesses. And after the acknowledgment it 
would be proper to give notice of it to the diplomatic characters here by visiting cards. 
</p><p>
November 6. This morning I waited on Mr. Van ImhofT, 
the President for the week, and delivered to him my credentials, which he said he should not fail to communicate to 
their High Mightinesses this forenoon. I then went to see 
Mr. Lelyvelt, the Commis of the States, and left the copy 
with him, the Greffier, Mr. Fagel, being absent. He told 
me that the resolution for my acknowledgment would not 
be passed till tomorrow, or the day after. That their High 
Mightinesses received communications only in three languages, viz. the Dutch, the French and the Latin. That as my credentials are in English, they must undergo a translation before they can be read in the Assembly, which would 
occasion this delay of a day or two. 
</p><p>
November 8. Mr. Van Hees, the Agent, called and informed me that the President of the week having communicated to their High Mightinesses the letter of credence from 
the United States, which I had delivered to him, they had 
passed a resolution, the purport of which he repeated, but 
so rapidly and in so low a voice that I could not particularly 
understand it. He said the Resolution was not yet reduced 
to writing, but as soon as it should be, he would send it to 
me. The amount of it is to acknowledge me in the character 
conferred on me by the President, and the proceeding is no 
doubt according to the usual forms.
</p><p>
November 10. I received from the Agent of their High Mightinesses the resolution relative to my reception, a copy 
and translation of which I inclose herewith. 
</p><p>
November n. You will observe by the Resolution of 
their High Mightinesses that an audience, either in the 
Assembly of the States or by Commissioners to be appointed 
for the purpose, is left at my election. I called this morn 
ing upon the Agent Van Hees to inquire, which of these 
alternatives had been chosen by my predecessor. He 
assured me that they were both mere formalities which were 
always dispensed with, except on particular and extraordi 
nary occasions, and had been so in the case of Mr. Short. 
That by the transmission of this resolution my reception 
and acknowledgment were completed, and if I had any 
communication to make for the future, the person with whom my official correspondence is to be maintained is the Greffier, and if I should have memorials to present, they are 
to be delivered to the weekly President. 
</p><p>
I am fearful, Sir, that this minute detail of forms may 
appear tedious and perhaps trivial. But in these countries 
they are so much in the habit of annexing importance to ac 
curacy in these particulars, and I have felt so much the want 
of information as to the mode of proceeding in this respect, 
that I thought it might at least save trouble upon some future 
occasion to have the regular process of reception transmitted to the Department over which you preside. I hope 
this consideration will apologize for the intrusion of a letter 
so very uninteresting as the present upon your perusal. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest 
respect, Sir, your humble and obedient servant.
