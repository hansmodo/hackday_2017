My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
There is considerable talk up at St. Augustine that 
our regiment is going north in the fall, but I won't 
believe any such thing until the order comes ; in fact, 
I want to stay till next spring, for I really believe that 
there is a shadow of hope of terminating this war in the 
coming winter, provided always no " treaties, truces, or 
talks." 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother,
