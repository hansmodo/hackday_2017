Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter to you of the 20th December last, contained 
some remarks relative to the perversions and obliquities 
which you had noticed, and which I observed were neither 
recent nor unexpected. In that letter, there was not room 
for explanatory details. Those remarks were therefore 
concise and general. To supply that deficiency is the 
design of this letter. 
</p><p>
These perversions and obliquities began on the receipt of 
a letter which I wrote to Congress, and of which the following is a copy. 
</p><p>
[Here was inserted the letter of 20/// Sept., <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>, relative 
to the instruction to the American commissioners appointed 
to negotiate the treaty of peace. See vol. i. p. 121.] 
</p><p>
This letter was written under the influence of indignant 
feelings, and in some respects with too little of deliberate 
consideration. The impressions it made on those who had 
originated and urged the instruction mentioned in it. may 
easily be conceived. 
</p><p>
That this instruction was more complimentary than wise, 
was afterward evinced by the circumstances which constrained the American commissioners at Paris to disobey 
it. That disobedience gave additional excitement to the 
displeasure and to the complaints of the French and their 
consociates. Nor were they pleased with the implied 
approbation of that disobedience, which resulted from my 
appointment to the office of secretary for foreign affairs, 
before my arrival in <a href='/results.php?year=1784'>1784</a>. From time to time after my 
return, I was informed of various incidents which showed 
that their malevolence was far from being dormant. 
</p><p>
The presumptuous attempts of the republican minister 
Genet, to facilitate the designs of France at the hazard of 
our peace and neutrality, gave occasion to the measures of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a> on that subject. Disappointed and 
irritated by these impediments, Genet and his partisans indulged themselves in animadversions on the administration 
and its advocates, which were neither candid nor decorous. 
</p><p>
The treaty with England in <a href='/results.php?year=1794'>1794</a>, did not accord with the 
views and wishes of France, nor with the views and wishes of 
sundry individuals among us. Although the strenuous efforts 
made to defeat it did not succeed, yet the feelings and motives which prompted those efforts continued to operate. 
</p><p>
Certain politicians, desirous to give a new direction to 
public opinion, finally succeeded in forming a party for the 
purpose, and in introducing a policy varying from that 
which <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a> and his friends had preferred. 
Those friends were not regarded with a friendly eye. 
</p><p>
They who censured the precipitate commencement, and 
the unsuccessful conduct of the late war with England, 
incurred the resentment of those by whom these errors 
were committed. 
</p><p>
Among those who had been active federalists, there were 
individuals who, at subsequent periods, were induced to 
think it expedient for them to join the opposing party. 
They who thus pass from one side to the other, are apt to 
mistake cunning for wisdom, and to act accordinglv. 
</p><p>
These details will suffice to explain the concise remarks 
in my letter. Many more might be added, and I could fill much paper with apposite anecdotes; but T forbear to enlarge on topics which (mutatis mutandis) the history of 
Greece and other countries, as well as observation and 
experience, have rendered familiar to us both. 
</p><p>
In the course of my public life, I have en ured to be 
</p><p>
uniform and independent ; having, from the I of it 
</p><p>
in <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>, never asked for an office or a vote, nor declined 
expressing my sentiments respecting such important public 
measures as, in my opinion, tended to promote or retard the 
welfare of our country. 
</p><p>
lou will, I am persuaded, pardon this egotism, and believe me to be, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your constant and affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
