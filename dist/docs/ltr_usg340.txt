DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
By arrangement of a year's standing Julia and I go to Newport on
Tuesday morning next, to be gone there, and at West Point, one week.
</p><p>
But for that we would visit you and Mother this week. I shall go next
week however and if Julia is not too much fatigued, or too lazy, with
her travelling will take her along. You know I never give any one
credit with being fatigued; I always attribute the feeling to another
cause.--I hope you are all well. Give my kindest regards to Mother and Mr. Corbin.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
