                            Camp Fredericksburg, February 6, 1863.

...I read yesterday, my precious daughter, your letter, and grieved
very much when last in Richmond at not seeing you.  My movements are
so uncertain that I cannot be relied on for anything.  The only place
I am to be found is in camp, and I am so cross now that I am not worth
seeing anywhere.  Here you will have to take me with the three stools--
the snow, the rain, and the mud.  The storm of the last twenty-four
hours has added to our stock of all, and we are now in a floating
condition.  But the sun and the wind will carry all off in time, and
then we shall appreciate our relief.  Our horses and mules suffer the
most.  They have to bear the cold and rain, tug through the mud, and
suffer all the time with hunger.  The roads are wretched, almost
impassable.  I heard of Mag lately.  One of our scouts brought me a
card of Margaret Stuart's with a pair of gauntlets directed to 'Cousin
Robert.'...  I have no news.  General Hooker is obliged to do something.
I do not know what it will be.  He is playing the Chinese game, trying
what frightening will do.  He runs out his guns, starts his wagons
and troops up and down the river, and creates an excitement generally.
Our men look on in wonder, give a cheer, and all again subsides in
statu quo ante bellum.  I wish you were here with me to-day.  You would
have to sit by this little stove, look out at the rain, and keep
yourself dry.  But here come, in all the wet, the adjutants-general
with the papers.  I must stop and go to work.  See how kind God is;
we have plenty to do in good weather and bad....
