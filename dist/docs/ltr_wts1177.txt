UNITED STATES SHIP SUSQUEHANNA (off Sandy Hook), 
</p><p>
Nov. 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1866">1866</a>. 
Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I had to make this trip to escape a worse duty, and to 
save another person from a complication that should be 
avoided. 
</p><p>
I am determined to keep out of political, or even quasipolitical office, and shall resign before being so placed, 
though I cannot afford to resign. 
</p><p>
I hope that Congress will not let power pass into the 
hands of such men as Butler, Phillips, etc. extreme 
men, as much so as Davis, Cobb, etc. We have escaped 
one horn of the dilemma, and ought if possible the 
other. But it is too late to argue anything, but I feel 
that if we cannot be calm and temperate in our country, 
we have no right to go to Mexico to offer ourselves as 
their example and special friends. You can write me 
through the Navy Department, as I may run to New 
Orleans where Sheridan could hold a letter for me, but 
I expect little the next two months. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
