My DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : It appears as if the fiends had let loose, for the Republican papers are tearing me to pieces in this border ruffian West. If 
I had committed murder in every city in this blessed Union, I could not be more traduced. 
And you know how innocent I have been of the intention of doing wrong. A piece in the morning Tribune, signed B, pretending to be a 
lady, says there is no doubt Mrs. L. is deranged has been for years past, and will end her 
life in a lunatic asylum. They would doubtless like me to begin it now. Mr. S., a very kind, 
sympathizing minister, has been with me this morning, and has now gone to see Mr. Medill, 
of the Tribune, to know if he sanctioned his paper publishing such an article. * * Pray 
for me, dear Lizzie, for I am very miserable and broken-hearted. Since writing this, I have just 
received a letter from -Mr. Keyes, begging and pleading with me to allow them to use my name 
for donations. I think I will consent. * 
</p><p>
Truly yours,
