DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I thank you for your obliging favor of the 13th, 
and assure you, that no man living approves the 
vigorous measures you mention, more than myself. 
Great bodies, you know, move slow, and it is as sure, 
that the most palpable and glorious events may be 
delayed, and the best causes finally lost by slow, 
timid, and indecisive counsels. We must be content, 
however, to take human nature as we find it, and 
endeavour to draw good out of evil. You will, no 
doubt, have heard the disgraceful conduct of our 
Norfolk [people], in suffering Lord Dunmore, with a 
few men, to take away their printing-press. 
</p><p>
It happened when the good men of that place were all away, and none but Tories and negroes remained behind. Virginia is much incensed; and five 
hundred men are ordered immediately down to Norfolk. I expect, by every post, to hear of the demolition of that infamous nest of Tories. 
</p><p>
By a vessel in twenty days from Quebec, which I 
believe brings us later intelligence than you had from 
thence when the last express left camp, we learn 
that the Lieutenant-Governor had twelve companies 
of Canadians in training, and that they were Generally on their guard. But the same account says, the 
Government was so suspicious of the attachment of 
its troops, that they were trusted with no more than 
four rounds of cartridges. This still gives us some 
hopes of success in that quarter. Before this reaches 
you, you will have heard of Colonel Allen's unlucky 
and unwise attempt upon Montreal ; nor have we, from 
the last accounts, much prospect of success from St. 
John s. The ministerial dependence on Canada is so 
great, that no object can be of greater importance to 
North America, than to defeat them there. It appears to me, that we must have that country with 
us this winter, cost what it will. Colonel Stephens 
writes me from Fort Pitt, that the Indians on that 
quarter came slowly in to the Commissioners, and that 
they evidently appear to be waiting the event of 
things in Canada, when they will surely, according 
to custom, join the strongest side. We have so many 
resources for powder, that I think we cannot fail 
of getting well supplied with that most necessary 
article. 
</p><p>
Remember me, if you please, to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague friend met'>General Gates</a>, and to all my acquaintances with you. I am, with 
great esteem and sincerity, dear Sir, your affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. Monday Morning. T is with infinite concern I inform you, that our good old Speaker, Peyton Randolph, Esquire, went yesterday to dine with Mr. 
Harry Hill, was taken, during the course of the dinner, with the dead palsy, and at nine o clock at night 
died without a groan. Thus has American liberty lost a powerful advocate, and human nature a sincere friend !
