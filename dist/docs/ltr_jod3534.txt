MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE the honor to be lodged here with no less a 
personage than the Prince of Hesse Cassel, who is 
here upon a visit. We occupy different apartments 
in the same house, and have no intercourse with each 
other, to be sure ; but some wags are of opinion, that 
if I were authorized to open a negotiation with him, 
I might obtain from him as many troops to fight on 
our side of the question as he has already hired out 
to the English against us. 
</p><p>
I have found every thing agreeable here as yet. 
The children are happy in their academy, of which I 
send you the plan enclosed. 
</p><p>
The English bounce a great deal about obtaining 
seven thousand troops from the petty German princes 
and ten thousand from Ireland to send to America, 
but this is only a repetition of their annual gasconade. 
We are in pain for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, S. C., being apprehensive that they have made or will make an effort to 
obtain that ; which will be a terrible misfortune to 
that people, and a great loss to the United States, but 
will be no lasting advantage to our enemies. 
</p><p>
The channel of correspondence you propose, by 
way of <a href='/results.php?city=bilboa' rel='city'>Bilboa</a> and Cadiz, will bring many letters no 
doubt, and I have received one of the 10th of December, but the postage is so expensive, being 
obliged to pay forty-four livres for the packet that 
came with yours, that I would not advise you to send 
any thing that way, unless it be a single letter or any 
thing material in the journals of Congress, or letters 
from my friends in Congress or elsewhere, that contain 
any thing particularly interesting. The house of Joseph Gardoqui and Sons have sent to you, by Captain Babson, of <a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a>, belonging to Mr. Tracy, 
some necessaries for the family, and you may write to Mr. Gardoqui for any thing you want by any vessel belonging to your uncle, to Mr. Jackson, or Mr. Tracy, provided you don t exceed one hundred dollars by any one vessel. Mr. Gardoqui will readily send them and draw upon me for the money. 
</p><p>
I had a great deal of pleasure in the acquaintance 
of this family of Guardoquis, and was treated by 
them with the magnificence of a prince. They will 
be very glad to be useful to you in any thing they 
can do. You will remember, however, that we have 
many children, and that our duty to them requires 
that we should manage all our affairs with the strictest economy. My journey through Spain has been 
infinitely expensive to me, and exceeded far my in 
come. It is very expensive here, and I fear that I 
shall find it difficult to make both ends meet ; but I 
must and will send you something for necessary use 
by every opportunity. If Mr. Lovell does not pro 
cure me the resolution of Congress I mentioned to 
him, that of drawing on a certain gentleman or his 
banker, I shall soon be starved out. Pray mention it 
to him. 
</p><p>
I shall write as often as possible, but conveyances 
will be very rare, I fear. 
</p><p>
I am, as I ever was and ever shall be, 
</p><p>
Yours, yours, yours. 
</p>
