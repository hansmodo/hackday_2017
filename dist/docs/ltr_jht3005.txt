SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your Excellency's letter of the 8th 
instant by the express, who was detained by sickness. and did not deliver it till the 12th, in the 
evening; and my own bodily indisposition is some 
hinderance. Your peremptory requisition is fully complied with; all our new levies will be at your camp 
with all convenient expedition. 
</p><p>
At the time they were by your direction to remain in the Colony on some reason to suspect a 
remove from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that they might 
be able to give them more speedy opposition, I 
ordered Colonel Webb, of our seventh regiment, his 
men being raised in the western part of the Colony, 
to take his station, with three or four companies, at 
Greenwich, the nearest town of this Colony to New York his Lieutenant-Colonel and company at New 
Haven; the residue of his and Colonel Huntington s, 
who were forward in their march, one company to 
Norwich and the rest to New London. Last week I 
sent orders to Colonel Webb to march the companies 
with him to New Haven, to be on his way so much 
nearer to your camp. 
</p><p>
I am surprised that mine of the 5th instant was 
not received, or not judged worthy of notice, as no 
mention is made of it. 
</p><p>
Stonington has been attacked and severely cannonaded, and by Divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> marvellously protected. 
</p><p>
New London and Stonington are still so menaced by the ministerial ships and troops, that the militia can not be thought sufficient for their security, and it is 
necessary to cast up some intrenchments. We are obliged actually to raise more men for their security, and for the towns of New Haven and Lyme. I 
hoped some of the new levies might have been left here till these dangers were over, without injury to your own operations. I own that must be left to 
your judgment; yet it would have given me pleasure to have been acquainted that you did consider it. 
</p><p>
I thank Divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> and you for this early 
warning to great care and watchfulness, that so the 
union of the Colonies may be settled on a permanent and happy basis. 
</p><p>
I have before me your more acceptable letter of 
the 9th instant. The necessities of the Colony to 
supply our two armed vessels, to furnish the men 
necessarily raised for defence of our seaports and 
coasts, and to raise the lead ore, which appears very 
promising, prevent our being able to spare more than half a ton, which is ordered forward with expedition. Before the necessity of raising more men 
appeared, we intended to send a ton. 
</p><p>
You may depend on our utmost exertions for the defence and security of the constitutional rights and 
liberty of the Colonies, and of our own in particular. 
None have shown greater forwardness, and thereby 
rendered themselves more the objects of ministerial 
vengeance. I am, with great esteem and regard for 
your personal character, Sir, your most obedient and 
</p><p>
Very humble servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. The Glasgow and Rose men-of-war are 
now at Newport, and threaten that, on the return of 
the Swan from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, probably with men for the 
purpose, they will attack New London and Stoning-ton. All the regiments in the Colony, at a great 
expense, have been disciplined ; and one quarter of 
them on the sea-coast are situated, equipped, and 
held in readiness as minute-men for every emergency
