Last night we were thrown into the most violent state of commotion by the unexpected entrance of 
Captain Bradford. He has been brought here a prisoner, from Asphodel, where he has been ever 
since the surrender of Port Hudson, and taking advantage of his tri-weekly parole, his first visit was naturally here, as he has no other friends. 
</p><p>
Poor creature, how he must have suffered! The 
first glance at his altered face where suffering and 
passion have both left their traces unmistakably 
since we last met, and the mere sight of his poor lame 
leg, filled my heart with compassion. 
</p><p>
How he hates Mr. Halsey! I could not forego the 
pleasure of provoking him into a discussion about 
him, knowing how they hated each other. He would 
not say anything against him; understand, that as a 
gentleman and a companion, Mr. Halsey was his 
warmest and best friend; there was no one he ad 
mired more; but he must say that as a soldier, he 
was the worst he had ever seen not that he was 
not as brave and gallant a man as ever lived, but he 
neglected his duties most shamefully while visiting <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> so constantly, eluding the sentinels daily as 
he asked for neither pass nor permission, and consulting only his inclinations instead of his superior 
officers or his business. And that last night at <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a>, when he absented himself without leave, why 
could he not have signified to him, his Captain, that 
he wished to say good-bye, instead of quietly doing 
as he pleased ? When the Colonel sent for a report of 
the number of men, quantity of forage and ammunition, etc., and it was discovered that John Halsey 
was absent without leave, with the books locked up 
and the keys in his pocket even after this lapse of 
time, the fire flashed through the ice as the Captain 
spoke. Sergeant Halsey, I am sorry for you when 
you reported yourself next day! All the fun that 
could have been crowded into an evening at <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> 
could not have repaid you for the morning's scene. 
And after all, what was it beyond very empty pleasure, with a great deal of laughter? He could have 
dispensed with it just as well. Looking back, I congratulate myself on being the only one who did not 
ask him to stay.

Only a few days ago came a letter so cheerful and hopeful we have waited and prayed so patiently 
at my feet lies one from Colonel Steadman saying he is dead. Dead! Suddenly and without a moment's 
warning summoned to God ! No ! it cannot be ! I am mad! O God, have mercy on us! My poor mother! 
And Lydia! Lydia! God comfort you! My brain seems afire. Am I mad? Not yet! God would not 
take him yet! He will come again! Hush, God is good ! Not dead ! not dead ! 
</p><p>
O Gibbes, come back to us!
