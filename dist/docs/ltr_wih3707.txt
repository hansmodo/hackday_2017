Dear General, 
I arrived here yesterday afternoon, found the General Assembly sitting, and presented your letter to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague met'>Governor Trumbull</a>, together with a representation, 
containing the spirit of my instructions. This morning I attended the Governor, Council, and the Representatives in the Council Chamber, when the papers were read, and I had an opportunity to speak on 
them. The papers were committed to a Committee 
of both Houses. I have the pleasure to acquaint 
your Excellency, they had that attention paid to 
them which their interesting importance required. A 
resolution has passed to send on immediately one 
hundred and sixty head of beef-cattle, which, it is 
supposed, will amount to five thousand rations per 
day, to the 1st of June. One thousand barrels of 
salted meat are also to be forwarded with the greatest 
despatch, with a quantity of rum. There are about 
a thousand barrels of salted meat deposited in this 
town ; it has been repacked, and is well stored. I 
shall endeavour, in the morning, to obtain a return 
of the whole quantity which has been procured in 
this State. I believe an accurate return has never 
been given in of the whole. 
</p><p>
An addition is made to the Committee of both 
Houses, who are to proceed to the consideration of 
the great supply for the campaign. Their resolutions 
on this head I think will equal your expectations. I 
have sent an express to Mr. Phelps, to forward all 
the beef-cattle he can command, without a moment's 
delay. I shall proceed to Rhode Island to-morrow, 
I have the honor to be, &c.,
