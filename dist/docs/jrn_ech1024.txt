I rambled several miles up and down the stream on Wednesday endeavoring to find a vacant lot. Just before noon I squatted upon a lot which I supposed vacant and commenced digging, but when I returned from dinner an old claimant came forth and I had to leave. In the afternoon I was more fortunate for I happened to find another which I can hold beyond doubt. I dug a hole in it and placed my tools there as evidence it was taken up. The next day I went down to my lot and threw out some dirt.

The weather being fine and very warm on Friday, in the forenoon I cut down and logged off a piece five feet long, of a large pine twenty inches in diameter, to hew a cradle out of it. It was mighty hard work and such blisters as appeared on my hands before I was half done, I had not been troubled with this many a day.
<p></p>
Since that time, McCowan being much better, he and I have been laboriously engaged at our cradle. We first attempted to split the log in two with an ax and wooden wedges, half of it being sufficiently deep, but it was too tough and would not split. We then borrowed an auger, butted off a small oak tree and made a maul that weighed about 25 or 30 pounds. This we could scarcely handle but when it came down, the wedges had to move, and we soon had it divided in halves. We bored and cut out the centre as much as we could with auger and ax. Here we were in a quandary as to where we could get an adze, a tool deemed almost essential to complete the washer. This difficulty was soon overcome, however, by taking the temper out of a small grubbing hoe I brought with me, borrowing a file and filing it sharp, then hardening it again, and by the use of this rude instrument I hoped we should be able to finish it the next day. I purchased a plate of sheet iron for our washer, 18 by 24 inches, for which I paid half an ounce.

Yesterday morning we again went to work. Who would ever have thought that three old bachelors like ourselves would be caught making a cradle for our own use? McCowan and myself worked steadily at it all day and yet it is not finished. It will require at least another day's work. In making it, about six feet of boards are requisite and this we had to hew out of the solid timber. I find it the hardest work ever I was engaged in. Boards are worth more than five times as much per hundred as they are per thousand at home, and yet this country abounds in tolerable good pine. But there is not a saw mill within several hundred miles.

Hearing of a vacant lot about two miles down the river, I shouldered my shovel after breakfast this
morning, and tramped down to the place, but was unable to find the particular one. As I went for the purpose of getting a lot, I shoveled out a small hole in one I supposed not already claimed, and left my shovel in it as evidence that it had an owner.

Tomorrow an election takes place for judge, sheriff, and other county officers, and today a meeting was held at one of the drinking and gambling establishments for the purpose of forming a ticket to be voted for. As I was returning home, I stopped a little while but the meeting had not then been organized and as I supposed it would not, I left shortly after. I heard one Captain Miller, who was a candidate, swear he had fought the guerrillas in the Mexican War, and upon one occasion he said he had saved the United States five millions of dollars, when it was near being lost at the National Bridge. To add to his other qualifications he was then gambling and pretty well overcome by red-eye.
