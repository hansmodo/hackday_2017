DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The 1st night the fire-ships and row-galleys made 
an attempt upon the enemy's ships, which lay at anchor up the river. The fire-ships were well conducted ; the armed schooner was grappled and burnt ; 
the Phoenix was grappled for about ten minutes, but 
got herself clear. The Lady Washington galley and 
Independence, were conducted with great judgment 
and bravery. I wish I could say that the other galleys did any thing at all. The Phoenix either slipt 
or cut her cable ; the Rose was left alone, and it is 
thought might have been taken. I was an eye-witness to the whole; and, from the confusion which was 
apparent, I am confident that if an attempt should 
be made on the fleet below, and but one or two 
ships set on fire, their confusion would be beyond 
description. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to acquaint your Excellency, that <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> has about five hundred men at 
a moment's notice, to aid you in case of need. They were the last evening drawn out, when I reviewed 
them. They are of Colonels Slice's and Magaw's regiments, and the best disciplined of any troops that 
I have yet seen in the army. I shall, this evening, or to-morrow, send a return of the troops at this 
post. We are pushing our works with all diligence. I have the honor to be, with great respect, 
Your Excellency's humble servant, 
</p><p>
