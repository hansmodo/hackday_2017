Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will by this express receive the agreeable intelligence of a general peace, upon which I most sincerely congratulate you and the army. Harmony, a 
regard for justice, and fidelity to our engagements, are all that now remains to render us a happy people. The vessel that brought these despatches was 
sent out by the Count d'Estaing to recall the French cruisers. As the Minister tells me he will forward the orders and passports to j^our Excellency, I will 
not detain the messenger till I have mine copied. This should, in my opinion, be immediately sent either by Congress or your Excellency to Sir Guy Carleton. 
</p><p>
A private letter to me mentions, that the Bahama Islands are also ceded to the British, Holland seems 
to have come worst off; and France, by getting little for herself, has laid in a store of reputation, which will 
be worth more than much territory. I must request your Excellency to send on the inclosed letters by express to the Governor. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rol" rel="me">Robert R. Livingston</a>..

P. S. I have thought proper to send Mr. Lewis Morris to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to inform General Carleton of 
the happy re-union of the powers at war ; and also of a resolution of Congress of this day, directing their 
Agent of Marine to take proper measures to stop all further hostilities by sea.
