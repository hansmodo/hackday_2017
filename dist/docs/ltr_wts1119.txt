Dear Brother : Very imprudently I was a witness of 
the firing on the people by the United States Militia at 
Camp Jackson yesterday. You will hear all manner of 
accounts, and as these will be brought to bear on the 
present Legislature to precipitate events, maybe secession, I will tell you what I saw. 
</p><p>
My office is up in Bremen, the extreme north of the 
city. The arsenal is at the extreme south. The State 
camp was in a pretty grove directly west of the city, 
bounded by Olive Street and Laclede Avenue. I went 
to my house on Locust, between Eleventh and Twelfth, 
at 3 P.M., and saw the whole city in commotion, and 
heard that the United States troops were marching from 
the arsenal to capture the State camp. At home I found 
Hugh and Charley Ewing and John Hunter so excited 
they would not wait" for dinner, but went out to see the 
expected battle. I had no such curiosity and stayed to 
dinner, after which I walked out, and soon met a man 
who told me General Frost had surrendered. I went 
back home and told Ellen, then took Willy to see the 
soldiers inarch back. I kept on walking, and about 
5.30 P.M. found myself in the grove, with soldiers all 
round, standing at rest. I went into the camp till 
turned aside by sentinels, and found myself with a promiscuous crowd, men, women, and children, inside the 
grove, near Olive Street. On that street the disarmed 
State troops, some eight hundred, were in ranks. Soon 
a heavy column of United States Eegulars followed by 
militia came down Olive Street, with music, and halted 
abreast of me. I went up and spoke to some of the 
officers, and fell back to a knoll, where I met Hugh and 
Charley and John Hunter. Soon the music again 
started, and as the Kegulars got abreast of the crowd, 
about sixty yards to my front and right, I observed them 
in confusion, using their bayonets to keep the crowd 
back, as I supposed. Still, they soon moved on, and as 
the militia reached the same point a similar confusion 
began. I heard a couple of shots, then half a dozen, and 
observed the militia were firing on the crowd at that 
point, but the fire kept creeping to the rear along the 
flank of the column, and, hearing balls cutting the leaves 
of trees over my head, I fell down on the grass and 
crept up to where Charley Ewing had my boy Willy. I 
also covered his person. Probably a hundred shots 
passed over the ground, but none near us. As soon as 
the fire slackened, I picked Willy up, and ran with him 
till behind the rising ground, and continued at my leisure 
out of harm's way, and went home. 
</p><p>
I saw no one shot, but some dozen men were killed, 
among them a woman and little girl. There must have 
been some provocation at the point where the Regulars 
charged bayonets and where the militia began their fire. 
The rest was irregular and unnecessary, for the crowd 
was back in the woods, a fence between them and the 
street. There was some cheering of the United States 
troops and some halloos for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff Davis</a>.

I hear all of Frost's command who would not take the 
oath of allegiance to the United States are prisoners at 
the arsenal. I suppose they will be held for the orders 
of the President. They were mostly composed of young 
men who doubtless were secessionists. Frost is a New 
Yorker and was a graduate of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=west point" rel="city">West Point</a>, served some 
years in the army, and married a Miss Graham here, a 
lady of great wealth and large connections. He was 
encamped by order of the Governor ; and this brings up 
the old question of State and United States authority. 
We cannot have two kings: one is enough; and of 
the two the United States must prevail. But in all the 
South, and even here, there are plenty who think the 
State is their king.

As ever, yours affectionately,
