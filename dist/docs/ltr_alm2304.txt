MY DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
I directed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rip" rel="met colleague">Major Platt</a>, some days since, to inform you, no provision
of any kind should be suffered to go below you till further orders.
Please to announce this to the justices. You have herewith a flag;
fill up the blank. On its return, desire the officer to call at
Colonel Phillips's for any papers or catalogues of books which may be
left there for me. The letter to Mr. Delancey to be left with the
enemy's officer on his advanced post. Cast your mind on the best means
of sweeping West<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chester" rel="city">Chester</a> and West Farms of the tories when it is good
sledding, supposing two regiments to cover you. But this under the
rose.
</p><p>
Gonsalez Manuel, the bearer of this, brings with him John Broughton, a
prisoner of war, who is exchanged. You will please to order him kept
at a convenient distance in the rear till the flag goes in, when he is
to be sent and delivered to the commanding officer of the advanced
post. A receipt must be taken for him and transmitted to me.
</p><p>
Affectionately,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alm" rel="me">ALEXANDER McDOUGALL</a>.
