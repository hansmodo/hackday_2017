Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Enclosed herein you will find copies of my letters of the 
twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth of June, and sixth of August, 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with copies of his letters 
to me of the third, nineteeth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth of July. 
From these you will perceive, that my application for an order to the Minister of France in America to pay, out of the 
funds to be furnished by the United States, the drafts made on 
his predecessor from St Domingo, produced the desired effect. 
Some subsequent circumstances have induced me to believe, 
that under that cover an attempt will be made to pay the bills 
drawn on Europe in favor of French citizens. I have certified signatures which seemed to be calculated for that purpose ; but, as I presume that measures will be taken of a cautionary nature, I shall not pretend to suggest any. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, Sir, in this correspondence one of the 
many violations of our flag in the case of the Little Cherub, which, being attended with circumstances of peculiar atrocity, 
called for more pointed animadversion. The conduct of the 
government on the occasion was perfectly proper. The per 
son, who committed the murder has, however, been acquitted 
on the testimony of his companions, in direct contradiction to 
that of the American master and crew. The case of the ship 
is still depending, and I know not what will be the event. It 
now appears that a part of the cargo on board of her was for 
account of Flemish merchants, and to be delivered at Ostend. 
But more of this presently. 
</p><p>
I must, however, take the liberty of recommending to the 
notice of government, Francis Coffyn, of Dunkirk, an old deputy of Mr Barclay, while he was Consul General. On many 
occasions, especially in the affair of the Little Cherub, he has 
behaved with much sense, spirit, and industry. The conduct 
of such business is by no means pleasant, neither is it without 
some personal danger, for, in the present situation of this country, the laws are but little respected, and it would seem as if 
pompous declarations of the rights of man were reiterated, only to render the daily violation of them more shocking. 
</p><p>
You will see, Sir, in my letter of the fourth of July, a 
clause asking the liberty of an American citizen. In my applications on that subject, I have been very cautious, fearing 
that I might be deceived by British seamen, and, consequently, that our countrymen might afterwards be without redress ; 
as, in such case, the government here would throw all the 
complaints aside as being unfounded. Among others, who 
have asked the protection of the United States, are some Nantucket whalemen. And, at first, their requests were so artfully made, that I was near being the dupe. I have, however, 
declined all interference in their favor, telling them that when 
they embarked under a foreign and rival flag, they forfeited 
by their own act the protection afforded by that of the United 
States, and must console themselves in their present situation 
by the privileges, which they formerly enjoyed, and which 
tempted them to engage in the British service. This is the 
general idea I have held out, but differently modified according to the various circumstances, which individuals have 
brought forward. These people are a sort of citizens of the 
world, and, wherever they went, were the most pernicious enemies to their native country ; because everywhere they solicited, either exclusion of, or else heavy duties on, the produce of our fisheries. At present, those who were settled 
at Dunkirk have, I am told, engaged in privateering. Probably, if the war lasts, the whole hive may settle again within 
the territory of the United States, and the more they endure, 
in the mean time, the sooner will they adopt that salutary de 
termination. 
</p><p>
The decree respecting neutral bottoms, so far as it regards 
the vessels of the United States, has, as you will see, been 
bandied about in a shameful manner. I am told from Havre, 
that it is by the force of money, that the determinations, which 
violate our rights, have been obtained; and on comparing 
dates, events, and circumstances, this idea seems to be but too 
well supported. I will make no comments on the facts, 
because my opinions are of no consequence. The true state 
of them will result from the enclosed pieces, and the United 
States will judge thereon. I have, &c.
