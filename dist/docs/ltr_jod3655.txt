MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
I AM favored this morning with yours of the 22d. 
This is accession day, you know. I shall always 
consider it as a red letter day ; a fortunate day. I am happy to know that you are comfortably situated. 
I am pretty well recovered of my cold, but it has reduced my flesh. James has found a beautiful pair 
of black horses, a perfect match for ours, and is distracted to persuade me to buy them. One is six 
years old, the other eight. I think with you that the 
second week in November will be soon enough for 
us to enter the city. I am looking out for Briesler now 
every day. You alone might possibly live here with 
me for a week ; but L. and B. could not be accommodated. You might all be well at Van Tilsburg's, 
but I think it will not be worth your while to leave 
your present situation. When Briesler comes on I 
shall write you more particularly. 
</p><p>
The next winter will be the last we shall ever 
spend in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. You will leave it early in 
April if you are wise, and you will come no more to 
the southward for one year and a half at least. You 
will never think of going to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> upon uncertainties, or rather upon the certainty of leaving it 
on the fourth of March, with five hundred and fifty 
or six hundred miles to ride through the mud. An 
election is approaching which will set us at liberty 
from these uncomfortable journeys, I am, as for 
thirty-five years I have been,
