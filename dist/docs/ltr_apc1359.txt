MY DEAREST DOLLY, How I miss you it would not be possible to say. The 
town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> is all confusion, no regularity anywhere, and after <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> it seemed as if I should be stifled ; the situations and prospects 
outside of the town are delightful, but you have heard from others, more capable 
of describing it. We have very pleasant lodgings, and for my companion the famous 
Madame Knox, who although very haughty I find pleasant and sensible. Chess is 
now her mania, which she plays extremely well, only too often for my fancy, who am 
not of late so partial to it. Every morning after breakfast, there is a summons 
from her ladyship, which if I attend pins me to her apron-string until time to dress 
for dinner, after which she retires, again inviting me to battle. Out of twenty-one 
games, in only two, and a drawn game, has she shown me any mercy ; she is certainly 
the most successful player I ever encountered. Thursday we dined at the Mortons , 
an extremely pleasant place, the house and grounds quite tasteful. Mrs. Morton 
strikes one most at home, believe me, and 
had I her establishment would never quit it for anything in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>. She has 
four fine daughters, all women, and two of them very pretty. They gave us a hand 
some dinner and a pleasant party, with a dash at Loo in the evening, to please Mrs. 
Knox, I suppose. The Federal party in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> prevails, however, in spite of my 
connections, I find much civility among them. Always, my dearly beloved sister, 
much love, in which my husband joins me. 
</p><p>
Yours devotedly, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="me">Anna</a>.
