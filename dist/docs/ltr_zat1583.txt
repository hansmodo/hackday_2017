My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your very acceptable letters of the 4th & 8th  inst the first from N. 
York the latter from the City of Washington, were duly rec d for which 
you have my best thanks ; & hardly need say the pleasure it afforded us 
to learn you, Ann & the girls had succeeded in reaching your place of 
destination <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, after so long a trip, without accident & in good 
health, which we sincerely hope you will long continue to enjoy 
</p><p>
I was pleased to know that a school had been fixed on at which the 
girls were to be placed, as it is important they should lose no time in 
prosecuting such branches of education as is important for them to acquire 
as they will be soon women, at any rate in size; I hope therefore the 
institution they will be placed at will prove such a one, as will afford all 
necessary advantages to enable them to complete their education without 
changing them to an other for that object, which is always attended with 
more or less disadvantages, at any rate with to persons of their age It 
appears I have rec d the nomination as the candidate of the Whig Convention which recently met in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, & alth I have not been officially notified of the same, yet I shall not hesitate to accept said nomination, 
as I understand it was made on the grounds I have occupied from the 
commencement ; without requiring of me pledges of any kind ; many 
pretended friends will throw or attempt to do so, as many obstacles in the 
way of my success as possible ; they have already commenced caveling or 
have taken acceptions in the Union to the course pursued by the deligation in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> particularly at the remarks of Judge Saunder in con 
vention ; even without exactly knowing what they were, I am satisfied there 
was nothing improper or even inconsistent in them ; the Judge is a man 
of as high character for truth, honor, honesty &c as any in the nation ; 
as well as possing a high order of talent ; I do not intend to go into the 
discussion of this matter, I have not changed in the slightest degree my 
position before the country as regards the presidency since I first assumed 
it ; & even if others have done so for me, or even it is so only in imagination, I shall not attempt to undeceive them, & if they themselves can 
not unravel the mistery to their satisfaction, why let them in the name of 
Heaven let them vote for some one else : which will give me no concern: 
for I can say in all sincerity the nomination was to me a matter of no 
exultation however much I may be gratified at the honor done me which 
is of no ordinary character coming from so distinguished a body for talents, patriotism & above all for purity of purpose &c as composed said 
convention ; yet it might have been better for the country had they designated could he have been elected some one of the prominent civilians of 
whom there are so many in the country ; & even should I be the success 
ful candidate I shall not rejoice, or mourn if defeated ; I am now fairly 
before the country & shall calmly abide the result be it what it my I 
was very much pleased to know you had determined to keep as much as 
possible out of the arena of this canvass, which I hope all those who are 
nearly connected to me, will do. I have just returned from the plantation 
where I remained two weeks ; while there we had quite a tornado which 
prostrated several House & a great deal of fencing & many trees, besides 
very much injuring the crop of both corn & cotton, particularly the for 
mer which appears to bear very heavily on Dick, who I left at the establishment, & where he will remain a few weeks 
Col Bliss has just heard of the [death?] of his mother which will he 
informs me compel him to go to New Hampshire in the course of a 
month or two 
</p><p>
The treaty is ratified, & the troops are leaving Mexico & returning 
home as rapidly as possible. I do not know what duty they will assign 
me to if to any, or whether I will be disbanded with the masses, which is 
quite probable, as I do not intend to quit the army voluntarily until after 
the result of presidential election is known, nor even then if unsuccessful 
</p><p>
Bob I learn you left at school in Kentucky where I hope he is doing 
well. Also that you have heard from John since you went North & that 
his health was not only good, but that he was getting on as well as could 
be expected, which I sincerely hope will continue to be the case 
</p><p>
I hope the Col & family are in the enjoyment of good health & 
pleased with their location. Mrs Taylor & Betty join me in wishing to 
be most kindly remembered to them ; as well as love to Ann & the girls 
when you see them & wishing you & them continued health & prosperity 
through a long life I remain truly

Your Friend

letters.
