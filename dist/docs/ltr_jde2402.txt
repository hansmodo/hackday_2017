MY DEAREST FRIEND : I know you must think it strange at not having heard from me since your arrival 
in <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and I am sure you must think it untimely 
in bidding you now farewell, to give only this paltry proof of my most affectionate regard and friendship ; yes, 
my dear <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="met friend">Blennerhassett</a>, my thoughts have been constantly occupied in reflecting on those poignant and trying afflictions, with which it has pleased a cruel destiny to overwhelm you, and for which I feel, not as the general run of mankind, but as one, I may say without vanity, not unworthy to participate, as I really and sincerely do, in your griefs. How often have I thought of Mrs. Blennerhassett ; I feel so much for your misfortunes 
that I durst not glance at the cause of them. I am now on the eve of embarking for our loved and native country ; 
I go by the way of England, for the more safety. Permission was granted me, by the last administration, to 
return for a twelvemonth, and I now take advantage of it in the hope of recovering my former estate, which, if 
I should, I may not only be a very independent, but a rich man in this country. Should I succeed, my friend 
of which there is but little doubt you and your estimable lady shall find by my actions, instead of words, what 
I truly and sincerely feel toward you both. In the mean time, I have made a friend for you, who offers to come 
forward in a pecuniary point of view, if necessary. The person is Mr. Pierce Butler, of <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, a nobleminded countryman of burs, with whom you need feel no 
scruple in calling upon in this way. The offer came, unsolicited, from himself, and he requested me to mention 
it to you. As I can not, unfortunately, at present, do more, I have nothing more to say, and conclude, my dear 
friend, with an affectionate remembrance to Mrs. Blennerhassett, 
</p><p>
Your truly attached and unalterable friend,
