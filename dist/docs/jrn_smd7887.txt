After supper last night, by way of variety, Anna, 
Miriam, and I came up to our room, and after undressing, commenced popping corn and making 
candy in the fireplace. We had scarcely commenced 
when three officers were announced, who found 
their way to the house to get some supper, they 
having very little chance of reaching <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> before 
morning, as the cars had run off the track. Of 
course, we could not appear; and they brought bad 
luck with them, for our corn would not pop, and our 
candy burned, while to add to our distress the odor 
of broiled chicken and hot biscuit was wafted up 
stairs, after a while, in the most provoking way. In 
vain we sent the most pathetic appeals by each servant, for a biscuit apiece, after our hard work. Mrs. Carter was obdurate until, tired out with our messages, she at last sent us an empty jelly-cup, a shred 
of chip beef, two polished drumsticks, and half a biscuit divided in three. With that bountiful repast 
we were forced to be content and go to bed.

At sunrise this morning, Mrs. Carter left to go down to her father in Iberville, to see her step mother who is expected to die. Scarcely had she 
gone when six more officers and soldiers came in from the still stationary cars to get their breakfast. We heard that Mr. Marsden, too, was down there, 
so the General sent him a nice breakfast, and I sent my love with it; but he had already breakfasted at Mr. Elder's. As soon as they left, we prepared for 
church, and just as we were ready, Captain Brown and Mr. Addison were announced. The Doctor greeted us with an elegant bow, but they did not 
remain long, as we were about going out.

Many officers were in church, and as I passed out, Colonel Breaux joined me, and escorted Miriam and 
me to the carriage, where we stood talking some time under the trees before getting in. He gave us a 
most pressing invitation to name a day to visit the camp that he might "have the pleasure of showing us the fortifications," and we said we would beg the 
General's permission to do so. Charming Colonel Breaux! Like all nice men, he is married, of course. 
He and another officer drove just behind our carriage in coming home, until we came to the fork of 
the road. Then, leaning from their buggy, both gentlemen bowed profoundly, which we as cordially 
returned. Two more behind followed their example, and to our great surprise, ten, who were seated in a 
small wagon drawn by two diminutive mules, bowed also, and, not content with that, rose to their feet as 
the distance between the two roads increased, and raised their caps, though in the most respectful 
silence. Rather queer; and I would have said impertinent had they been any others than Confederates fighting for us, who, of course, are privileged people.
