Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The moving state in which the army was at the time your letter of the 12th ultimo came to hand, the junction of the alhed troops at that period, and a variety 
of matters which have occurred since the junction, and consequent thereon, rather than a disinclination to continue a correspondence, the benefits of which were in 
my favor, must plead as an excuse for my silence till 
now. Unconscious of having given you just cause to 
change the favorable sentiments you have expressed for 
me, I could not suppose an alteration on your part; 
and, as I never suffer reports, unsupported by proofs, 
to have weight in my mind, I know no reason why our 
correspondence should cease, or become less frequent 
than heretofore, excepting on my part, that, as our affairs get more or less involved in perplexity, my attention is proportionably engaged, and more or less leisure is allowed for indulgences. 
</p><p>
That we have hail a very cDinpeteiit portion, and a great variety of difficulties of late, a person, so well informed of public matters as you are, needs not be told. 
The distresses of Virginia I am but too well acquainted with ; but the plan you have suggested as a relief for 
it is, in my judgment, a greater proof of your unbounded confidence in me, than it is, that your means proposed would be found adequate to the end in view, 
were it practicable to make the experiment, which at present it is not, as there are insuperable obstacles to my removing from the immediate command of the auxiliary troops. 
</p><p>
The reasons for this opinion I cannot commit to paper, at all times liable to miscarriage, but peculiarly so of late. I am fully persuaded, however, and upon good 
military principles, that the measures I have adopted will give more effectual and speedy relief to the State 
of Virginia, than my marching thither with dictatorial powers, at the head of every man I could draw from 
hence, without leaving the important posts on the North 
River quite defenceless, and these States open to devastation and ruin. When I say this, I would be understood to mean, if I am properly supported by the 
States eastward of Jersey inclusive. My present plan 
of operation, which I have been preparing with all the 
zeal and activity in my power, will, I am morally certain, with proper support produce one of two things ; 
either the fall of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, or a withdrawal of the 
troops from Virginia, excepting a garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, at which place, I have no doubt of the enemy's 
intention of establishing a permanent post. A long 
land march, in which we have never failed to dissipate 
half of our men, the difficulty and expense of transportation, and other reasons not less powerful, but 
which I dare not commit to writing, decided me in 
my present plan ; and my hopes, I trust, will not be 
disappointed. 
</p><p>
In half an hour's conversation I could, I think, convince you of the utility of my plan ; but, as I have 
before observed, I do not attempt it by letter, because 
I have already had two important ones intercepted in 
the mails, the sight of which, I am persuaded, occasioned the retrograde movements of Lord Cornwallis, and 
will be the means of bringing a part of his force to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to the accomplishment of one part of my 
expectation. 
</p><p>
No endeavours of mine have been wanting to obtain a naval superiority in these seas, nor to employ 
that which we have to valuable purposes. How far I 
have succeeded in the latter is but too obvious ; how 
far I may see my wishes accomplished in the former, 
time must discover. With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear Sir, &c.
