<br> My dear Horace, <br> How quickly the weeks fly by. So near to the fall weather and still some things 
to do before winter. Thur. a.m. we had a real Eastern thunderstorm with rain and 
some hail. It was really quite disturbing to one’s nerves. Velina and little John 
were over for a little while Mrs. Jones was away. They were both a good deal frightened. 
I went over as soon as I could. The “wighting” was pretty hard on John but he 
soon recovered his usual spirits and activity and I was glad when Velina took 
him home. The Sept. rains have done a great deal of damage as well as a great 
deal of good. Pa dried out and put in the barn two tons of hay and there are still 
as much or more pears on lot which father will fork over S. It is astonishing 
the growth everything has made since the warm rain. The prunes were sure hit hard 
also the hay men but the cattlemen are rejoicing. A man who took part of Cooley’s 
said it was a grand thing for the orchard of every kind. All the wells were going 
dry. The best father could do. He could hardly get two rows of trees across the 
five acrtes in one day and there are still 3 rows to irrigate but I think they 
will do although the rain was slight this a.m. More thunder than anything else. 
I saw the Jofas on Stowells place picking strawberries and raspberris faster than 
any other time this summer. I sent you Jay’s address last Sunday letter. Hope 
you have all the delayed mail by this time. I think there is still a lot at Camp 
Lewis which never came to you but that cannot be helped. Am in hopes you will 
get everything now. I want to be sure to tell you that the interest on your place 
is paid all but $30. And we will have enough to pay [unintelligible] on your L.I. 
Also your father has paid all Masonic dues. So All things seem to adjust themselves. 
Will write to Mr. Prevost sometime soon and as him how things are there. I forgot 
to say in the proper place that we have $35 in thrift stamps which are there for 
emergency. I think this will be enough for the present. Will write again next 
week. <br><br> Your loving mother Sarah King
