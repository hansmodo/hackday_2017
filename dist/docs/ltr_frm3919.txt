DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Yours of the 5th inst. came to hand. I am very sorry to hear you 
are yet sick. Yesterday, Major Ganey and myself signed a treaty. 
The principals are to submit it, and those who do not chose it are to 
be permitted to go within the enemy's lines with their wives and children, and their movable property, except stock, which they may sell. 
It seems all the officers will *go, and a few men who are so notorious, 
as they will not be suffered to live. Col. Fanning, with thirty men came a few days ago in the truce, and is thought will endeavor to make 
his way to Charlestown; but it is not unlikely he may make some 
attempt on your post, as his number is increased since he came. You 
will, therefore, guard against any sudden attack, by keeping a look-out 
at Wragg's and Black River Ferries. I am informed your troops receive rations of coffee and sugar I mean the militia with you. I 
never knew that such articles were ever given to troops but in a besieged 
garrison, where provisions are scarce, "and therefore must be stopped. 
Mutton, veal and poultry are not soldiers food. I also am informed, 
that the officer who succeeds you in command, when you are absent, 
gives passes to men to go to Dewees with articles for tradiDg. You 
must give a general order te prevent it, and occasional commandants 
must be notified to take that liberty. Please send me some coffee by 
the bearer, as I am entirely out. You will let me know any particulars 
you may learn, for I find I cannot return soon, as we cannot finish here 
before the 25th ult., which is the time that these who are to go to 
town are to march, and possibly some few on the line, who never were 
subject to any command, may give us further trouble. I am with wishing you a speedy recovery, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
