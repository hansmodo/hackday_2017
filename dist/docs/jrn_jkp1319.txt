I received a telegraphic despatch from the office of the Baltimore Sun stating that by a special express who bad come from Pensacola, beating the mail one day, information had been received that the city of Vera Cruz and the castle of San Juan de Ulloa had surrendered on the 27th ultimo to the combined operation of our land and naval forces, with the loss of only 36 men on our part. This was joyful news. In about two hours afterwards a more detailed account of the capitulation was received, published in the Sun and taken from a Pensacola paper. . .

The Cabinet assembled at the usual hour. . . The subject of consideration today was the Mexican War. I had several times mentioned to Mr. Buchanan the importance of having a commissioner vested with plenipotentiary powers, who should attend the headquarters of the army ready to take advantage of circumstances as they might arise to negotiate for peace. I stated to the Cabinet today that such was my opinion, and that I thought it the more important since the news of the recent victories, and especially since the information receiving this morning of the fall of Vera Cruz and the castle of San Juan de Ulloa. All the members of the

Cabinet present concurred in this opinion. The embarrassment in carrying it out consisted in the selection of a suitable commission or commissioners who would be satisfactory to the country. This was a great difficulty. Such is the jealousy of the different factions of the Democratic party in reference to the next Presidential election towards each other that it is impossible to appoint any prominent man or men without giving extensive dissatisfaction to others, and thus jeopardizing the ratification of any treaty they might make. In this also the Cabinet were agreed. I stated that I preferred that the Secretary of State should be the sole commissioner to negotiate the treaty, and that I would have no hesitation in deputing him on that special service if the Mexican authorities had agreed to appoint commissioners on their part, but as they had refused to do this he could not attend the headquarters of the army for an indefinite period of time and with no assurance whether the Mexican authorities would agree to negotiate. Mr. Buchanan expressed his entire concurrence in this view. He said he would be willing to go in person if there was any assurance that negotiations would be speedily opened, but under existing circumstances and with our present information he could not, of course, think of going. Mr. Buchanan then suggested that Mr. N. P. Trist, the chief clerk of the Department of State, might be deputed secretly with plenipotentiary powers to the headquarters of the army, and that it might be made known that such a person was with the army ready to negotiate. Mr. Trist, he said, was an able man, perfectly familiar with the Spanish character and language, and might go with special and well-defined instructions.  3  The suggestions struck  me favourably. After much conversation on the subject it was unanimously agreed by the Cabinet that it would be proper to send Mr. Trist, and that he should take with him a treaty drawn up by the Secretary of State and approved by the Cabinet, which he should be authorized to tender to the Mexican Government, and to conclude a treaty with them if they would accept it; but that if they would not accept it, but would agree to appoint commissioners to negotiate, Mr. Trist should in that event report the fact to his government, when Mr. Buchanan could go out as the commissioner. This being agreed upon by the members of the Cabinet present, and it being desirable, as it was a very important matter, that every member should be consulted, I sent for the Secretary of the Treasury, who had retired. He came, and I laid the whole matter fully before him. He fully concurred in opinion with the other members of the Cabinet.

After the consideration of some other matters all the members of the Cabinet retired except Mr. Buchanan, whom I requested to remain. I sent to the Department of State for Mr. Trist, and in the presence of Mr. Buchanan I opened the matter fully to him. He gave his assent to go on the mission. I then charged him to keep the matter a profound secret. I requested Mr. Buchanan to go to work immediately and with the least practicable delay to prepare the project of a treaty and the necessary instructions, and in order that it might be kept a profound secret. I impressed it upon him that no clerk or other person in his Department should have any knowledge of it. Both Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Trist said that Mr. Derrick, one of the clerks in the Department of State, could render important aid in preparing  and copying the necessary papers. After some hesitation I agreed that he might be so employed, but that he should be placed under the strictest injunctions of secrecy.
