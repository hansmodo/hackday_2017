Since my last letter the Indian Chiefs from the South Fork have come in and sued for peace and the people have
had so much business on hand that mining has been neglected.
</p><p>
King 'Tulas' was accompanied by eight warriors and a large crowd assembled to hear him tell his story. A young man who has resided some years among them acted as interpreter. A stand was erected and the old chief mounted the rostrum without the slightest embarrasment and talked like a book. He was greeted with hearty cheers and his appearance was interesting. We dressed him up in white pants and shirt, two coats and a beaver hat and white kids, which he felt very proud of. The language is not as rough as I supposed and his gestures were natural. Of course we had great sport: 'Now he's on internal improvements,' says one. 'Ask him if he goes for Scott,' says another. But old Tulas talked right to the point. He promised to eat no more mules if he could be allowed to come on to the river and fish, and said 'he was glad to see we had such good houses and plenty of blankets and he would come over this winter and live with us.'

The Treaty was drawn up and signed and afterwards we had a war dance. A large ring was formed and lighted with candles and the crowd at last sat down in front and order was restored. There must have been at least a thousand persons present. The Indians dressed in all their finery with their bows and arrows came bounding into the ring and were received with thundering applause. They sang and yelled and danced after the most approved style probably. The squaw Kate sat as long as she could and then went in and was as savage as ever. The old associations came over her and she couldn't stand still.
</p><p>
The entertainment went off very well but it was nothing to the grand Hoolah Hoolah at Tahiti.
</p><p>
The Indians went back very pleased with their visit and I don't think it will be their fault if the Treaty is
broken, as the wrong in most all cases is first on the side of the whites. The poor Indians have been treated with great cruelty, I always thought, by our forefathers at home, but they have been killed off in this State like some wild animals, without the slightest cause and driven to actual starvation. Moreover, these Indians in the mountains are not so mean a race as those in the valley. They are larger and possess more intelligence and are easier civilized than any other Indians I have ever seen. There are five boys in town who are as bright and smart as any white boys. Enough said about the Diggers.

While we were in the midst of the Treaty a man by the name of Holt, who started to go to Shasta, was found shot about 2 miles from town. Suspicion immediately fell on an Irishman: Michael Grant, who was seen in company with him close by the spot where he was found. He was arrested and from the facts which soon came out, the sovereign people: i.e. a mob, held a meeting and resolved to take him. He was taken and the question put to the people whether he should be tried by the people or by the legal tribunal. The Judge was asked how long it would be before he could be tried by the Court and he stated that the Court could not sit until next January and as there is no jail nor money in the treasury to keep him and the credit of the County good for nothing, it was decided that it would save time and money and be altogether better to try him and hang him right off.
</p><p>
A Judge was appointed, a jury impaneled and he was tried and found guilty. After the sentence was read a dispute arose as to whether he should be hung right up the next morning or have ten days. Although a majority of the people voted for ten days the minority held on to hang him the next day. High words ensued. Pistols were drawn and I thought for sometime that half a dozen more lives would be lost in discussing this point. But finally the
few blood-thirsty scoundrels (who will probably be hung themselves) were ruled down and ten days were given him. The time expired to-day and at eleven o'clock to-day a wagon on which he was standing was driven out from under which caused his death by strangulation. He had a Catholic Priest to attend on him, which he said was a great consolation and died perfectly resigned to his lot. He was about 25 years of age.

Although no one has the slightest doubt as to his guilt and I think he suffered justly, yet I say Heaven preserve me from falling into the hands of an excited people. It is a hard tribunal and if circumstances are against you, however innocent you may be, you stand no chance. Give me a dungeon in the Tombs and all the police of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> first.

Cole goes down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> tomorrow and will wait for Sarah. I shall be glad to see her. Business is good and if we had more capital we could make lots of money. We began on $2000 and we have nearly doubled that now. We take in nearly all dust at $16 per oz and in S.F. get $17.25 for it. The rise in goods this season has made immense fortunes 'below' but here is the best place in the long run, as this winter they will probably lose about as much.
</p><p>
The weather is very cold. We occupy an elevated position, probably four or five thousand feet above the Pacific. It freezes every night now, solid, and snow fell on the mountains in sight, the other night. But the climate is not like yours, as it is just as cold now as in January.

Write me every month and if you don't like these blood-thirsty letters say so and I will gloss it over.
