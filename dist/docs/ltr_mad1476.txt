DEAR Sin, I was yesterday favored with yours of the 10th 
instant. The various reports arrived of late from the Chesapeake prepared us for a confirmation from our correspondents 
of a fortunate rencontre between the two fleets. A continuation of these reports, although unsupported by any authentic 
evidence, still keeps up the public anxiety. We have not heard 
a word of De Banes. The arrival of Digby is far from being 
certain, and the circulating reports have reduced his force to 
six ships of the line. The preparations at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> for some 
movement are pretty well attested. The conjectures of many 
are directing it against this city, as the most practicable and 
important object within the reach of Clinton. The successful 
blow struck by the parricide Arnold against the town of New 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> is described, as far as the particulars are known here, 
in the enclosed Gazette. There have been several arrivals of 
late from Europe with very little intelligence of any kind, and 
with none from official sources. It all relates to the junction 
of the French and Spanish fleets, for the purpose of renewing 
the investiture of Gibraltar, and enterprising something against 
Minorca. Thus the selfish projects of Spain not only withhold 
from us the co-operation of their armaments, but divert in part 
that of our allies; and yet we are to reward her with a cession 
of what constitutes the value of the finest part of America.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> and the Count de Rochambeau, with 
the forces under them, have, I presume, by this time, got within 
Virginia. This revolution in our military plan cannot fail to 
produce great advantages to the Southern department, and particularly to Virginia, even if the immediate object of it should 
be unexpectedly frustrated. The presence of the Commanderin-chief, with the proportion of our force which will always 
attend him, will better protect the country against the depredations of the enemy, although he should be followed by troops 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> which would otherwise remain there, than it 
has hitherto been ; will leave the militia more at leisure to pursue their occupations, at the same time that the demands of the 
armies will afford a sure market for the surplus provisions of 
the country; will diffuse among them a share of the gold and 
silver of our ally, and, I may now say, of our own, of which 
their Northern brethren have hitherto had a monopoly, which 
will be peculiarly grateful to them after having been so long 
gorged with depreciating paper; and as we may suppose that 
the ships of our ally allotted for our serv.e will, so long as his 
troops remain in the United States, be kept in the Chesapeake, 
it will revive the trade through that channel, reduce the price 
of imported necessaries, and raise the staple of the country once 
more to its proper value.

I am, Dr Sir, your sincere friend, and obt serv.
