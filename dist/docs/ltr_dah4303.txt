My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
I have forwarded to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, for your information, the continuation of my proceedings until the 
present time. You will be pleased to observe, by my 
letter to him of this date, that the Court of Lisbon, 
having, from a desire of opening an official intercourse 
with the United States, made the first advances, by 
appointing a Minister Resident to repair thither, now 
finds it an unpleasant and difficult task to tread back 
the steps it has thus, as an elder nation, taken in 
respect to us. It would doubtless be desirable to 
meet those advances, if it may be done without impropriety. 
</p><p>
I do not know what particular reasons exist on the 
part of the Government of the United States (except 
those which relate to expenses), that might induce it 
to decline making an appointment, which would be 
so satisfactory to this Court. There seems to be considerable force in what the Chevalier de Pinto has 
alleged, with the intent to obviate the embarrassments, 
on account of the pecuniary provision. The proper 
and necessary expenses of a Charge des Affaires will, 
I believe, be pretty nearly the same in every respect, 
with those of a Minister Resident. Should I have 
the honor of being nominated in the latter quality, 
in return for the Chevalier de Freire, by the best 
inquiries I have been able to make, I think, as a 
single man, I may establish a household, and, with 
good economy, live decently, in such a manner as 
not to discredit myself or my nation, for the salary 
annexed to the office of Charge des Affaires. If, therefore, a change of the name should take place, I 
should expect it to be with a restriction to the salary 
of a Charge des Affaires. In case of appointment to 
either grade, according to permission of the act of 
Congress, I suppose, however, a sum not exceeding 
(nor less than) a year's salary will be granted to the 
person so appointed, for the purchase of furniture, &c. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> well remembers what inconveniences 
resulted to him, from the want of such a provision for outfits, and how indispensably necessary it will be, under all circumstances, at the beginning. 
Here the difference between hiring a house furnished, 
or unfurnished, is much greater than in France. The 
rent of a good house, unfurnished, but beautifully 
situated, in the neighbourhood of Lisbon, is very reasonable. 
</p><p>
I would not have troubled you with these details, 
trifling in themselves, though, under certain circumstances, they may be somewhat interesting to me, had 
not the Minister of her Most Faithful Majesty seemed so much attached to the idea of continuing the 
appointment of Minister Resident to his friend, the 
Chevalier de Freire, that I am induced to imagine a 
refusal, on our part, to make an exchange in that 
grade, would not only prevent that gentleman from 
going to America at all, but perhaps any arrangement for the exchange of diplomatic characters, for 
the present. This Court having recalled its Ambassador from Rome, to succeed the Chevalier de Freire 
at London, this last-mentioned gentleman must be entirely thrown out of employment, until some vacancy 
shall happen ; and the Court may have to encounter 
either the real or pretended difficulty of not being 
able to find a character, suitable and willing to fill 
the office of a Charge des Affaires in the United 
States. A similar real or pretended difficulty, you 
may recollect, has long existed in the British Cabinet. 
</p><p>
I only beg leave farther to suggest, in case an 
appointment of any nature whatsoever should be 
made by the Executive of America to this Court, 
whether it would not be a good opportunity for you, 
as Chief Magistrate of the United States, to write a 
short letter to the Queen, in your own hand (to be 
presented at the first audience, with the public eredentials), expressive of your sense of the friendly dispositions her Majesty has manifested towards the 
United States, especially in the orders given for the 
Portuguese fleets to afford any succour to American 
vessels, and to protect them from the Algerine corsairs. 
This singular instance of attention, which has, in fact, 
been very useful to our Mediterranean trade, seems 
to merit, on our part, some particular notice. The 
Queen would probably be much flattered by your 
likewise taking occasion to express a desire of cultivating the amity and commerce, which so happily subsist between the two nations, and which (being founded 
upon principles of mutual advantage, without any interfering claims or discordant interests) promise to be 
of long and beneficial continuance. With every sentiment of affection and respect, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
