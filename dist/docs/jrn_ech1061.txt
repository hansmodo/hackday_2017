We have made about 240 miles each day. I have been somewhat seasick. After continued thunder and lightning during the night, a very little rain, and squalls, at daylight yesterday we found
ourselves in sight of the coastvery rugged, mountainous land, apparently covered thickly with low chaparral. Soon after, we met a steamer with passengers from Panama to San Francisco.

After a warm and damp night, we arrived in the harbor of Acapulco, where we were boarded by the Custom House officers and permitted to land, paying the natives 25 and 50 cents for carrying us in boats to the landing. The natives are nearly as red as our aborigines.

Acapulco contains a population of several thousand, and is built at the foot of very high and rugged hills, extending almost to the water's edge. The streets are narrow and run a zigzag course, but are remarkably clean and well paved. The houses are but one story high, with few windows and no chimneys, the floors usually laid with brick and cemented, the walls of adobes plastered and whitewashed, the roof of tiles well laid and cemented with plaster. Each large building has an open court or yard in its center and some few of the houses are carpeted. I observed one piano.

Fruits are abundant and cheap. Cocoanuts, oranges, lemons, limes, bananas, and melons grow in various parts of the city and vicinity. The coco groves are a great ornament to the place, with their tall, slim, trunks without a single limb to the very top, and then a fine bunch of nuts, and their long waving leaves. The oranges, however, are not of a very fine quality.

The climate is very warm and the inhabitants dress in the coolest and simplest manner. They are all Catholics and spend much of their time in amusements. They have their gambling saloons. In the afternoon, we attended a cockfight, at which large sums were staked. There is a very strong fort, well armed, which
commands the harbor and its entrance, and there are some interesting ruins which evidence the former greatness of the place and the destroying power of the earthquake. About a mile from the city, on the road to the city of Mexico, is a stone bridge built in 1783 which is no discredit to that time. The walls of this bridge, as well as those of the fort, have been split in several places by earthquakes.

Board and lodging is eight dollars per week; single meals one dollar, but they can be afforded at much less. Dry goods and liquors are as cheap as in New York. The steamers are here supplied with stores, coal, chickens, hogs, and cattle.

We had a deal of amusement with the fishing boys, who swarmed around the boat, swimming in the water, while the passengers threw dimes for them to dive after. They are expert divers and would sometimes go down to the depth of 25 or 30 feet and seldom miss the object sought after. The bay is not very large but finely protected on all sides by high hills.
