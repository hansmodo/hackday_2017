<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='1'>1st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=chester' rel='city origin'>CHESTER</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. In Chester still. I climb these steep steps alone. They have all gone, all passed by. Buck went with 
Mr. C. Hampton to York. Mary, Mrs. Huger, and Pinckney took flight together. One day just before they began to 
dissolve in air, Captain Gay was seated at the table, half way between me on the top step and John in the window, 
with his legs outside. Said some one to-day, " She showed me her engagement ring, and I put it back on her hand. 
She is engaged, but not to me. " " By the heaven that is above us all, I saw you kiss her hand." " That I deny." 
Captain Gay glared in angry surprise, and insisted that he had seen it. " Sit down, Gay," said the cool captain in 
his most mournful way. "You see, my father died when I was a baby, and my grandfather took me in hand. To him 
I owe this moral maxim. He is ninety years old, a wise old man. Now, remember my grandfather's teaching forever-more A gentleman must not kiss and tell.

General Preston came to say good-by. He will take his family abroad at once. Burnside, in New Orleans, owes 
him some money and will pay it. There will be no more confiscation, my dear madam, said he ; "they must see 
that we have been punished enough. " "They do not think so, my dear general. This very day a party of Federals 
passed in hot pursuit of our President.

A terrible fire-eater, one of the few men left in the world who believe we have a right divine, being white, to hold 
Africans, who are black, in bonds forever ; he is six feet two ; an athlete ; a splendid specimen of the animal man ; but he has never been under fire; his place in the service was a 
bomb-proof office, so-called. With a face red-hot with rage he denounced Jen Davis and <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a>. " Come, now," said 
Edward, the handsome, " men who could fight and did not, they are the men who ruined us. We wanted soldiers. If 
the men who are cursing Jeff Davis now had fought with <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a>, and fought as <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> fought, we d be all right now.

And then he told of my trouble one day while <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> was here. " Just such a fellow as you came up on this little 
platform, and before Mrs. Chesnut could warn him, began to heap insults on Jeff Davis and his satrap, <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a>. Mrs. Chesnut held up her hands. Stop, not another word. You shall not abuse my friends here! Not Jeff Davis be hind his back, not <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> to his face, for he is in that room and hears you. : Fancy how dumfounded this creature was.

Mrs. Huger told a story of <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> in his callow days before he was famous. After an illness <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston's</a> 
hair all fell out; not a hair was left on his head, which shone like a fiery cannon-ball. One of the gentlemen from 
Africa who waited at table sniggered so at dinner that he was ordered out by the grave and decorous black butler. 
General Huger, feeling for the agonies of young Africa, as he strove to stifle his mirth, suggested that <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> 
should cover his head with his handkerchief. A red silk one was produced, and turban-shaped, placed on his head. 
That completely finished the gravity of the butler, who fled in helplessness. His guffaw on the outside of the door be 
came plainly audible. General Huger then suggested, as they must have the waiter back, or the dinner could not go 
on, that Joe should eat with his hat on, which he did.
