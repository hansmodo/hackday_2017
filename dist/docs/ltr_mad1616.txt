DEAR SIR, Mr. Warville Brissot has just arrived here, and 
I seize an opportunity suddenly brought to my knowledge to 
thank you for your several favors, and particularly for the pedometer. Answers to themust be put off for the next 
opportunity. 
</p><p>
My last went off just as a vote was taken in the Convention 
of this State, which foretold the ratification of the new Government. The latter act soon followed, and is inclosed. The form 
of it is remarkable. I inclose, also, a circular address to the 
other States on the subject of amendments, from which mischiefs 
are apprehended. The great danger in the present crisis is, that 
if another Convention should be soon assembled it would terminate in discord, or in alterations of the federal system, which 
would throw back essential powers into the State Legislatures. 
The delay of a few years will assuage the jealousies which have 
been artificially created by designing men, and will at the same 
time point out the faults which really call for amendment. At 
present, the public mind is neither sufficiently cool nor sufficiently informed for so delicate an operation.

The Convention of North Carolina met on the 21st ultimo. 
Not a word has yet been heard from its deliberations. Rhode 
Island has not resumed the subject since it was referred to and 
rejected by the people in their several Towns. 
</p><p>
Congress have been employed for several weeks in the arrangement of time and place for bringing the new Government 
into agency. The first has been agreed on, though not definitively, and makes it pretty certain that the first meeting will be 
held in the third week in March. The place has been a subject 
of much discussion, and continues to be uncertain. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, as least eccentric of any place capable of affording due 
accommodations and a respectable outset to the Government, 
was the first proposed. The affirmative votes were New Hampshire, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North 
Carolina. Delaware was present and in favor of that place, but 
one of its Delegates wishing to have a question on Wilmington 
previous to a final determination, divided that State and negatived the motion. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> came next in view, to which was 
opposed first Lancaster, which failed, and then <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, which, 
to the surprise of every body, was carried by seven States. 
South Carolina, which had preferred <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> to the two 
other more Southern positions, unexpectedly concurring in this. 
The vote, however, was soon rescinded; the State of South Carolina receding, the Eastern States remonstrating against, and 
few serv.usly urging, the eligibility of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. At present 
the question lies as it was originally supposed to do, between 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and nothing can be more uncertain than the event of it. Rhode Island, which alone was disposed to give the casting vote to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, has refused to give 
any final vote for arranging and carrying into effect a system 
to which that State is opposed, and both the delegates have returned home.

Col. Carrington tells me has sent you the first volume of the 
federalist, and adds the second by this conveyance. I believe 
I never have yet mentioned to you that publication. It was 
undertaken last fall by Jay, Hamilton, and myself. The proposal came from the two former. The execution was thrown, 
by the sickness of Jay, mostly on the two others. Though carried on in concert, the writers are not mutually answerable for 
all the ideas of each other, there being seldom time for even a 
perusal of the pieces by any but the writer before they were 
wanted at the press, and sometimes hardly by the writer himself.

I have not a moment for a line to Mazzei. Tell him I have 
received his books, and shall attempt to get them disposed of. 
I fear his calculations will not be fulfilled by the demand for 
them here in the French language. His affair with Dorman 
stands as it did. Of his affair with Foster Webb I can say 
nothing. I suspect it will turn out badly. 
Yours affectionately.
