My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your very welcome & interesting letters of the 27 th ult & 5th & 
8 th ins t with copies of one to you from Col Davis & one from a Mr Eaton 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a>, accompanied by several papers & scraps cut from various 
other, having just reached me, all of which have been read with deep interest & for which you have my sincere thanks. It was to me a source of 
real gratification to hear you were all in good health when you last heard 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> which I sincerely hope they will long continue to enjoy ; 
alth I am under constant apprehension & shall continue so particularly 
on your acc until I know the contageon which is now so fatal in the city & 
I fear has reached the Barracks, has subsided ; as you must be constantly 
breathing & infected atmosphere, & you will be more than fortunate if 
escape it ; but you will should it come have the system well prepared by 
diet, so as to pass through its baneful effects without any serious results 
growing out of it. I got a letter from Betty saying they were all well, 
dated the 24th  that Ann & the two girls had joined them ; & that the 
crowd had very much diminished ; all of which I was pleased to hear, 
as the danger of any contagion will diminish in breaking out there, or 
spreading should it be brought, as the visitors diminish. I hope you will 
have heard froMrob before this that he reached his place of destination 
in good health without accident, & entered on his studies with zeal & perseverance. I am pleased that John is likely to have a long voyage in the 
Pacific, as it is in the way of his profession, & I wish to see him a distinguished member of it, & to do so he must unite both practice & 
theory ; I sincerely hope he will not for a moment neglect his books & 
studies 
</p><p>
On the subject of the family going to Kentucky your included, I 
preferred their doing so to going to the Lakes, as I thought it would have 
been more beneficial to their health, & would have avoided the danger 
from fever at the watering places on the lakes which I have known to be 
very fatal at those places, & avoid the danger from its effects should they 
have to pass through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> while it is liable to be taken ; & if they 
have to remain at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> until frost, which in all probability will be 
some time in Nov r they will become heartily tired of the place before it 
will be prudent for them to leave it, particularly should it be healthy at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> ; but I trust all will end well 
</p><p>
If Ann Bob & the girls had any one to look after & attend to their 
wants, I do not consider your plan of locating Ann if it met her wishes, 
at New Haven or Geneva, until the children were educated, which would 
take perhaps some four years ; it would perhaps be less expensive than 
sending them to boarding schools, & it seems to me that it is very desirable to have children especially girls educated under the eye of their 
mothers ; this would have been better than resigning unless you could go 
at once into private practice, which is difficult to do. Should this war 
continue which there is every prospect of its doing for some time, officers 
both line & staff must expect to be separated from their families, to a very 
great extent, & fortunate will he be, after it is over, who can obtain a 
tolerably pleasant station, as the whole country from the gulf along the 
boundary which seperates the U. States & Mexico to the Pacific, will have 
to be garrisoned 
</p><p>
About the 9th ins t we rec d across the country alth not official, news 
which could be relied on, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> had defeated the Mexican army 
after two days fighting which terminated on the 20th ult near the City of 
Mexico, which had resulted in an armistice to afford Mr Trist & commissioners on :he part of the Mexican gov an opportunity to settle the 
differences between the two countries by negotiation ; we are therefore 
calculating here, that the war would soon be brought to a close & that we 
would be able to return once more to the U. States to mingle with our 
families & friends ; but how great the disappointment ; three days since 
information reached us as before across the country, which can be relied 
on, that negotiations & of course the armistice had been broken off, & 
that hostilities commenced; which was on the 9th ins c the result of which 
has not reached us ; but I presume <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> is now in the city ; as soon 
as I hear that is the case, & he is in full & peaceable possession, I shall 
apply for permission to return to the U. States & hope I shall be able to 
join my family early in December, if not by the first ; but most things 
are uncertain, but I shall do so, as soon as I can leave with propriety ; & 
my family & friends must not expect me before 
</p><p>
The deaths by yellow fever in the city are truly distressing particularly in Aug f much more than they had been for many years during the 
same period, & I much fear the same will continue to be the case during 
the present & following months or Sept r & October or until there is a 
frost to check it in the latter ; the only thing that will prevent this being 
the case, will be the decrease of unacclimated persons for it to operate 
on I am astonished that all who could do so, did not at once leave 
the city as soon as that disease made its appearance Denny could have 
sent his family somewhere out of its influence. It was a source of real 
gratification to learn the cases you had at the Barracks were of a mild 
form, & that most of those attacked had recovered, & truly do I hope 
that this favorable state of things may continue ; the number of sick at 
the Barracks are too numerous for one physician, & there out to be some 
one to aid you ; if there is no Army Dr a citizen should be hired I 
think Gen B. acted wisely in going out of the city, & I suppose he is 
located at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> until the sickly season is at end. The troops on this 
line particularly at Saltillo, have greatly improved in health during the last 
six weeks 
</p><p>
It is impossible to say what course Congress will pursue even should 
the Whigs have a small majority in the next House of Representatives, 
in regard to this war, which I think is becoming more unpopular every 
day judging from the facility of raising volunteers, particularly in the 
West, as well as in obtaining recruits for the regular army, that the whigs 
will hardly withhold the necessary supplies for carrying it on while we had 
so large an army in the field ; which the Union says will be 30 thousand 
with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> in a very short time ; which I should not be surprised at, 
judging from the number of the new regt s of volunteers which are called 
out, & now on their way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> to act on that line ; the administration seems just to have waked up as from a dream & it is not improba 
ble, this wonderful act of energy has been brought about under the 
expectation that it would have a bearing on a whig congress in many 
ways, especially in the way of supplies &c I have read Mr Eaton s 
letter or the copy you were so good as to enclose ; nor would I go into 
the presidential chair by subscribing the doctrines he has laid down ; nor 
will I accept a nomination exclusively from either of the great parties 
which divide the country, the moment I done so, I would become the 
slave of a party instead of the chief magistrate of the nation should I be 
elected ; without meddling with politics, or mixing myself up with political men in any way I have for many years considered the policy advocated 
by the whigs for the most part, more nearly assimelated to those of Mr 
Jefferson than those of the opponents which induced me to range myself 
on that side, & with these views I would have voted for Mr Clay at the 
last election, had I voted at all, which I have never done for any one of 
our chief magistrates since I entered the army or before, which is near 
forty years ; & could the present state of our national affairs have been 
forseen, I believe that every man who loved his country more than party 
or office, would have done the same. I would not be chief magistrate on 
any other terms than those which I have avowed ; & have written to 
several political men to that effect. All who are writing me about a U. 
States Bank which is dead, & will not be revived in my time, the tariff 
which will be increased only for revenue ; internal improvement, which 
will go on in spite of presidential vetoes ; & the Wilmot proviso, which 
was brought into congress to array the South against the [North] must, or 
ought to be left to congress, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> has nothing to do with making 
laws, he must approve or veto them ; when approved or passed by a 
majority of two thirds, his business is to see them proper executed. My 
opinion on those subjects are in too many instances used to my injury ; 
1 have already said enough which has been published & shall refer all such 
writers to what has been already written & published 
</p><p>
No one can possibly respect the opinions of an other more than I do 
those of Col Davis & I know he is my most devoted & ardent friend, 
but I think he is mistaken in supposing the whigs as a body are haling 
off from me; but even if they should do so, it is no reason I should 
change my opinion in political matters ; I shall pursue a straight forward 
course deviating neither to the right or left so that comes what may I hope 
my real friends will never have to blush for me, so far as truth, honesty & 
fair dealings are concerned. If the whigs think proper to play a double part 
with the purpose of deceiving, it will result to their disadvantage & not to 
mine ; nor shall I complain if they drop me altogather, & take up some 
one else, as I most truly say I do not want the office ; & sincerely regret I 
was thought of for the same. I have just concluded long letter to a per 
sonal friend a moderate whig in answer to one from him, in which he says 
some of the strong Democrats in K? who were ready to unite with the 
whigs in the Lexington district, to nominate me for the presidency with 
out regard to party, & that arrangements had been made for such a meet 
ing when the whigs backed out of it, as was supposed through the 
influence of Mr Clay, & thought I would aid in bringing Mr C. before 
the country for the office in question; in reply I informed him that alth 
I would much prefer seeing Mr Clay in the chair of state than myself, & 
would not be in his way if I knew he could be elected, yet I would not 
loan myself to elevate Mr C. or any one els to that position ; alth I had 
rec d several letters urging me to decline in favor of that individual & to 
urge his election ; these letters I have paid no attention to, nor do I intend 
to do so ; believing the people are capable of attending to such matters, & 
if I was to presume to attempt to dictate to them who they ought to place 
at the head of the gov 1 it would have the effect to make him Mr C. more 
unpopular, & me ridiculous. As a matter of course there are many both 
whigs & democrats that will be opposed to me, or any other individual 
who will not go the whole length of the party- 
Col Davis is correct in supposing the abolitionists will oppose my 
election, or that of any Southern man ; & I have doubts if we have for 
many years another president from a slave holding state, & particularly a 
slave holder. The Col is also correct in believing that the Secretary of 
War was not disposed to give me such a force as would have justified me 
in making a forward movement into the heart of the enemies country ; I 
am satisfied it was long since determined by Mr Marcy & others after due 
consultation & deliberation, that I should not have an opportunity of 
accomplishing any thing more than I had already done ; which determination has been carried out to the very letter up to the present moment ; 
but I hope the Col will let this pass, when he takes his seat in the senate 
or if he notices it at all, it will only be in an incidental way 
</p><p>
Among others I regret to hear of the very unpleasant state of the 
weather, from unusual long cold rains, which must have a very serious 
influence on the prevailing disease unavoidably so, besides the gloom it 
must cast over those who are under the necessity of witnessing the ravages it makes ; but ere this I sincerely hope the weather has become as 
pleasant as could be expected at the present season, & that it has had the 
effect of arresting the contagion to some extent, as well as to impart more 
cheerfulness to those who are mixed up with it. There is no probability 
of my returning to the city until long after the contageon passes away 
There will be no doubt a great blow out between Kearney, Fremont, 
Benton & the Secretary of War, how it will all terminate time must determine ; it is possible as they are all togather at Washington it may all be 
arranged without proceeding to extremeties by mutual explanations, & 
concessions as they are all politicians ; Benton will be most difficult to satisfy 
</p><p>
Between ourselves <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> would stoop to any thing however low 
& contemptable as any man in the nation, to obtain power or place, & be 
as arbitrary in using it when in possession; between him, Trist & the 
powers that be, old Harry may take the hindmost, they are all of a piece 
</p><p>
The plan of leaving the troops on their way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> above is a 
very judicious one, until transportation be provided to send them to their 
place of destination as it would not do to stop them in the city or in the 
influence of the infected atmosphere 
</p><p>
The anxiety about the safety of your family is quite natural but it 
ought not to absorb every other consideration ; we should do the best 
we could for them, after which to submit to the decrees of an all wise 
providence in the best way we could 
</p><p>
I regret my position before the country as a candidate for the chief 
magistracy should give you one moments concern, for I can truly say I 
will be fully as well satisfied if dropped as a candidate, or left out as I 
would be in reaching that high station ; for admitting I should do so, it 
will neither lengthen my days, nor add to my happiness, why then should 
I wish it 
</p><p>
I thank you for the way you replied to Mr Eaton. As every thing 
is very wet, I fear you will have great difficulty in making out what I have 
written 
</p><p>
We have this moment rec d information here that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> had 
fought a battle on the 1 2 th ins t had defeated the Mexicans & entered the 
City of Mexico, Santa Anna having abandoned it, which I presume is the 
case, we have no particulars ; & presume you will receive all the import 
ant events connected with it by the way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> before this reaches 
you 
</p><p>
My love to Ann & the children when you write, & wishing you & 
yours continued health & prosperity, I remain truly your
