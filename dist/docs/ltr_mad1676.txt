DEAR SIR, You will see by the papers herewith covered 
that the proposed assumption of the State debts continues to 
employ the deliberations of the House of Representatives. The 
question seems now to be near its decision, and unfortunately, 
though so momentous a one, is likely to turn on a very small 
majority, possibly on a single vote. The measure is not only 
liable to many objections of a general cast, but in its present 
form is particularly unfriendly to the interests of Virginia. In 
this light it is viewed by all her representatives, except Col. 
Bland. 
</p><p>
The American Revolution, with its foreign and future consequences, is a subject of such magnitude that every circumstance 
connected with it, more especially every one leading to it, is 
already, and will be more and more a matter of investigation. 
In this view, I consider the proceedings in Virginia during the 
crisis of the stamp act as worthy of particular remembrance, 
and a communication of them as a sort of debt due from her 
cotemporary citizens to their successors. As I know of no 
memory on which my curiosity could draw for more correct or 
more judicious information, you must forgive this resort to 
yours. Were I to consult nothing but my curiosity, my enquiries would not be very limited. But as I could not indulge 
that motive fully without abusing the right I have assumed, my 
request goes no farther than that you will, as leisure and recollection may permit, briefly note on paper by whom and how the 
subject commenced in the Assembly; where the resolutions proposed by Mr. Henry reaRy originated; what was the sum of the 
arguments for and against them, and who were the principal 
speakers on each side; with any little anecdotes throwing light 
on the transaction, on the characters concerned in it, or on the 
temper of the colony at the time.
