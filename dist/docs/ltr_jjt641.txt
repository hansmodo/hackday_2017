My dear Sister
</p><p>
I have been desiring to write to you for some time, but have been prevented from doing so. I am sorry to learn that your eyes trouble you so much. I wish you would try the simple remedy of washing them with cold water, lifting the water to the face in both hands and washing the face until a little water gets into the eyes and they commence smarting. Do this at night just before going to bed, and again immediately after getting up. I hope that you are improving, and that Mr. Arnold is likewise. Anna is suffering from a very bad cold. She has been confined to her bed for nearly a week, but is up this afternoon.
</p><p>
I don't know how Mr. Arnold thinks Wm. L. Jackson would do for a judge, but if he would like to see him elected over Edmondson and can do anything for him I hope that he will do so. I thought that probably there might be some person or persons living near his Father's old place beyond Weston with whom he might have influence; if such is not the case, do not say anything about the subject to him and probably you had better say nothing anyway to him upon the subject. From what I have heard, Wm. will very probably be elected.
</p><p>
I hope that the children are all doing well. Anna joins me in love to you all.

Your affec. brother <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjt" rel="me">Thomas</a>.
