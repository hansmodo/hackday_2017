Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The impaired state of my health and the situation 
of my family, together with the unsettled state of 
my accounts with New Hampshire, render my presence there, the ensuing winter, very necessary. I 
have never, as yet, settled my depreciation, nor received any cash, on that head, from them. I should 
be very glad to do it this winter, without which 
it will be in a manner impossible for me to subsist 
in the army. 
</p><p>
The brigade that I have had the honor to command; are now ordered to join their respective States' 
troops; therefore it is not probable that it will be in 
my power to render my country any essential service until the opening of another campaign. 
</p><p>
The many favors I have received, and the known 
zeal you have shown for your officers, together with 
your care of their interest, strongly invite me to 
ask the favor of absence until the spring. That 
this request may be granted, is the ardent desire of 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
