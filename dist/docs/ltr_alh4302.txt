Sir, 
</p><p>
The inclosed I write more in a public than in a 
private capacity. Here I write as a citizen zealous 
for the true happiness of this country; as a soldier, 
who feels what is due to an army which has suffered 
every thing, and done much for the safety of America. 
</p><p>
I sincerely wish ingratitude was not so natural to 
the human heart as it is. I sincerely wish there 
were no seeds of it in those who direct the counsels 
of the United States. But while I urge the army 
to moderation, and advise your Excellency to take 
the direction of their discontents, and endeavour to 
confine them within the bounds of duty, I cannot, as 
an honest man, conceal from you, that I am afraid 
their distrust has too much foundation. Republican 
jealousy has in it a principle of hostility to an arm}', 
whatever be their merits, whatever be their claims to 
the gratitude of the community. It acknowledges 
their services with unwillingness, and rewards them 
with reluctance. I see this temper, though smothered 
with great care, involuntarily breaking out upon too 
many occasions. I often feel a mortification, which 
it would be impolitic to express, that sets my passions at variance with my reason. Too many, I perceive, if they could do it with safety or color, would 
be glad to elude the just pretensions of the army. I 
hope this is not the prevailing disposition. 
</p><p>
But, supposing the country ungrateful, what can 
the army do? It must submit to its hard fate. To 
seek redress by its arms, would end in its ruin. The 
army would moulder by its own weight, and for want 
of the means of keeping together; the soldiery would 
abandon their officers ; there would be no chance of 
success, without having recourse to means that would 
reverse our revolution. I make these observations, 
not that I imagine your Excellency can want motives 
to continue your influence in the path of moderation, 
but merely to show why I cannot myself enter into 
the views of coercion, which some gentlemen entertain ; for, I confess, could force avail, I should almost wish to see it employed. I have an indifferent 
opinion of the honesty of this country, and ill forebodings as to its future system. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will perceive I have written with 
sensations of chagrin, and will make allowance for 
coloring ; but the general picture is too true. God 
send us all more wisdom! I am, very sincerely and 
respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
