<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='29'>29th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Trying to brave it out. They have plenty, yet let our men freeze and starve in their prisons. 
Would you be willing to be as wicked as they are? A thousand times, no ! But we must feed our army first if 
we can do so much as that. Our captives need not starve if <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> would consent to exchange prisoners; but men 
are nothing to the United States things to throw away. If they send our men back they strengthen our army, and 
so again their policy is to keep everybody and everything here in order to help starve us out. That, too, is what <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> destruction means to starve us out.

Young Brevard asked me to play accompaniments for him. The guitar is my instrument, or was; so I sang and 
played, to my own great delight. It was a distraction. Then I made egg-nog for the soldier boys below and came 
home. Have spent a very pleasant evening. Begone, dull care; you and I never agree.

Ellen and I are shut up here. It is rain, rain, everlasting rain. As our money is worthless, are we not to starve ? 
Heavens! how grateful I was to-day when Mrs. McLean sent me a piece of chicken. I think the emptiness of my 
larder has leaked out. To-day Mrs. Munroe sent me hot cakes and eggs for my breakfast.
