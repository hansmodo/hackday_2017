My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I am happy in having an opportunity of introducing 
to your acquaintance the brave Col Fleury, whose 
reputation is not unknown to you. At the same time, 
I cannot but regret that he is called to another 
employment when I was in hopes of having engaged 
him as a colleague and coadjutor in raising the famous 
black battalion, with which I have troubled you so 
much lately. 
</p><p>
The resolutions of Congress is a sufficient recommendation of this young gentleman to your notice. I 
will only add, that I am happy in having laid the foundation of what I hope will be an inviolable friendship with him. 
</p><p>
Your most dutiful and affectionate 
</p><p>
