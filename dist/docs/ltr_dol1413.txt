Come to us as soon as you can, and bring them all with you ; I am as deeply 
interested in them as if they were my own. Where are. her remains ? I will my 
self write my gratitude to the kind friends who were privileged to do what I could not for my lamented sister.

this to Dolly and Mary, please, as I can not write to them at this moment. Yours came yesterday.
