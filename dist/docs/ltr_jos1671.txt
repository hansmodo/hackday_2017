Dear Brother: I am very desirous to accept your 
invitation. The trip would be an instructive and pleasant one, and if I were not restrained by the interests of 
others I would surely go at once. But we are now 
involved in an exciting and important political contest. 
The canvass in Ohio is substantially between the Government and the Rebellion, and is assuming all the bitterness of such a step. If I should leave now, it would 
be like a General leaving before the day of battle. I 
have been speaking very often, and must keep it up. I 
propose, however, to arrange all my business so that 
I may leave soon after the election, say about the 
20th of October, and will then go down the river and 
spend all the time until the meeting of Congress. I 
hope to be able to go via <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, 
Charleston, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. If a favorable opportunity 
offers at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, I wish to develop 
my ideas as to a reconstruction of the Union. I know 
these will suit you a good deal better than they will the 
administration, but I feel quite independent of the latter 
and am disposed to follow my own course. . . .

General Ord stopped with me last Sunday on his way 
East. We were all glad to see him, as he gave us many 
interesting details of your situation and operations. 
Your promotion as Brigadier in the Regular Army gave 
unusual satisfaction. I was in Dayton, Springfield, 
Marysville, and Stanton's 1 neighborhood and conversed 
with many about his attacks on you. I find he is terribly unpopular. Your recent success and his libels on 
you are the subject of general remarks. At one place 
I mentioned your name in connection with other Ohio 
Generals who have distinguished themselves, and the 
crowd stopped me and gave you three as hearty cheers 
as ever man got. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
