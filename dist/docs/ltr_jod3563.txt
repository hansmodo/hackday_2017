MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received yours of the 5th. If you think it 
best, leave Thomas at college, but I pray you to 
come on with Charles, as soon as possible. As to the 
place, let my brother plough and plant as he will, 
as much as he will. He may send me my half of 
the butter, cheese, &c., here. As to money to bear 
your expenses, you must, if you can, borrow of some 
friend, enough to bring you here. If you cannot 
borrow enough, you must sell horses, oxen, sheep, 
cows, any thing at any rate rather than not come on. 
If no one will take the place, leave it to the birds of 
the air and beasts of the field, but at all events break 
up that establishment and that household. As to 
Daniel, he has a wife and cannot leave her ; besides, 
he makes great wages where he is ; but if you have 
a mind to bring Daniel, you may. We can do with 
out him. 
</p><p>
I have as many difficulties here, as you can have, 
public and private ; but my life from my cradle has 
been a series of difficulties, and that series will continue to the grave. I hope Briesler will come, but if 
he cannot, we can do without him. I have taken Moustier's house, on the North River, a mile out of 
town. There is room enough and accommodations 
of all sorts, but no furniture. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., tenderly, 
</p><p>
