DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
We find, by the destination of the prisoners of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne's</a> army to this neighbourhood, a 
wide and difficult field opens to us. To provide quarters, provisions, fuel, &c., for five or six thousand 
men, will be no small task. The Assembly suppose 
them to be under my direction, and have advised 
that they be placed in the barracks on Prospect and 
Winter Hills, <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and Sewell's Point- and, 
indeed, I do not see where else they can be quartered, if they are to remain together, and near this 
place. I have applied for a thousand or twelve hundred men for guards and am determined, on the one hand, to treat them with politeness and humanity, 
and, on the other, with precaution and strict order. 
But I must entreat your Excellency's endeavours to 
facilitate their removal as soon as possible, as their 
continuance, for any considerable time, will greatly 
distress the inhabitants, both as to provisions and 
fuel, especially the latter. 
</p><p>
Wood is now twelve or fourteen dollars per cord, 
on the wharves, and the inhabitants cannot obtain a 
supply at that price. So many of the coasters are 
taken by the enemy's cruisers, that they are become 
very unwilling to run the risk of falling into their 
hands. I submit to your Excellency the propriety 
and expediency of obtaining a protection from Lord 
Howe for such a number of vessels as may be 
thought necessary to supply the prisoners, from the 
eastern country. If some such method cannot be devised, I do not at present see how it can be obtained. I have wrote to Congress on the subject, and 
would also request your Excellency's direction as 
soon as may be convenient .to you. As soon as the 
disposition of, and regulations for, the prisoners are 
made, I will transmit them to your Excellency. It 
will be necessary, if practicable, to convey a quantity 
of flour this way. I have the honor to be, with 
great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
