INSTRUCTIONS DEPARTMENT OF STATE, August 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
Separate instructions for Mr. Adams, relative to the exchange of ratifications, which Mr. Deas will be directed to execute, if 
Mr. Adams does not go over before the 2Oth Day of October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>- 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The first part of the business, for which you are called to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> 
by my letter of the 14 instant, is the exchange of ratifications 
of the late treaty between the United States and Great Britain. 
</p><p>
The documents, now transmitted, as relating thereto, are I, a 
copy of that letter; 2, a printed but authentic copy of the treaty 
and resolution of the Senate advising the ratification ; 3, a copy 
of the memorial from the Department of State to the British minister plenipotentiary near the United States ; and 4, a letter from 
the President to his Britannic majesty, indicating the functions, which you are destined to fulfil. 
</p><p>
At the earliest possible moment after your arrival in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, 
you will communicate to the proper persons belonging to the 
British ministry, your mission, as stated in the memorial ; and 
request that the conferences necessary to its conclusion, may be 
expedited. 
</p><p>
When you shall come into conference, you will declare, that you 
are possessed of the ratification, as it was promised in the memo 
rial ; but that you are instructed to inquire into the existence of a late order, said to be issued under the authority of his Britannic 
majesty, for the seizure of the provision vessels, even of neutral nations. If the order does not exist, or existing does not operate on the vessels of the United States, you will proceed to 
accomplish the exchange of ratifications, as is hereinafter mentioned. If the order does exist, and does operate on the vessels of 
the United States, you will make such representations, as that order shall suggest relative to the interests and situation of the United 
States ; to the end that it may be removed ; and particularly, that the ratification of the President must not be construed into 
an admission of the legality of the said order. Minute instructions cannot now be given, concerning that order, as our accounts of it 
are very imperfect. But if after every prudent effort, you find that it cannot be removed, its continuance is not to be an obstacle 
to the exchange of ratifications. 
</p><p>
When, therefore, these preliminaries as to the order shall be finished, you will produce the President's ratification ; and offer to 
exchange the same, in behalf of the United States, for an equivalent ratification on the part of his Britannic majesty ; that is, for a 
ratification, corresponding with the advice and consent of the Senate. 
</p><p>
The negotiations to be made after the exchange of ratifications will be marked out in other instructions. 
</p><p>
If on the part of the British King a ratification shall be exchanged, conformably with that of the President ; then you will immediately 
dispatch, by the most expeditious and safe conveyances, three copies of the British ratification, addressed to this Department. 
For the attainment of expedition and safety, you will be at liberty to incur a reasonable expense. Congress will meet on the first 
Monday in December next, and it is therefore desireable that the British ratification should be here early enough for the taking 
of certain necessary steps, concerning the treaty before that time. 
</p><p>
You will also, in the event of an exchange of ratifications, urge that orders be immediately given for the execution of the second 
article, respecting the evacuation of the posts, and for the proper measures, which are thereby provided to be taken by concert 
between the government of the United States and the British Governor General in America for settling the previous arrangements, which may be necessary, respecting the delivery of the said posts. 
</p><p>
The agreement which is to be made in pursuance of the 8th article, respecting the pay of commissioners, will also be attended 
to. In the fixing of the quantum, you will observe due economy. Mr. Hammond has intimated 150x3 sterling per annum to each; 
except the commissioners for determining the river St Croix, for whom 1000 per annum was proposed. Beyond these sums you 
are not to go, and you will endeavor to reduce them as low as propriety will admit. 
</p><p>
If his Britannic majesty shall refuse to ratify on the condition required by the Senate, you will say, that being possessed of only 
one form of ratification, you will without delay forward to the President his said majesty's determination ; and will wait without 
taking a definite step, until you shall receive further orders. In this case you will perceive the importance of the information to us ; 
and that it will be necessary, unless you have at least two immediate opportunities, to hire an advice boat to bring the intelligence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, or to some port, near at hand. 
</p><p>
If Mr. Pinckney should unexpectedly return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> before this part of the business is finished, you will place it in his hands 
(he being the ordinary minister, and having co-operated in the negotiation) ; unless, indeed, it shall appear to Mr. Pinckney 
unadviseable for him to enter into it. By the special command of the President. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tip" rel="met co-worker">JTIMOTHY PICKERING</a>, 
</p><p>
at this time executing the office of Secretary of State.
