Mrs. Preston was offended by the story of Buck's performance at the Ive's. General Breckinridge 
told her " it was the most beautifully unconscious act he ever saw. The General was leaning against the wall, Buck standing guard by him " on her two feet." The crowd surged that way, and she held out her arm to protect him 
from the rush. After they had all passed she handed him his crutches, and they, too, moved slowly away. <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> 
said: " Any woman in Richmond would have done the same joyfully, but few could do it so gracefully. Buck is 
made so conspicuous by her beauty, whatever she does can not fail to attract attention.

Johnny stayed at home only one day; then went to his plantation, got several thousand Confederate dollars, and 
in the afternoon drove out with Mrs. K . At the Bee Store he spent a thousand of his money; bought us gloves 
and linen. Well, one can do without gloves, but linen is next to life itself.

Yesterday the President walked home from church with me. He said he was so glad to see my husband at church ; 
had never seen him there before ; remarked on how well he looked, etc. I replied that he looked so well " because you 
have never before seen him in the part of the right man in the right place/ ! My husband has no fancy for being 
planted in pews, but he is utterly Christian in his creed.
