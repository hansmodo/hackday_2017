SIR, 
</p><p>
The situation of my department has been, for a 
long time, peculiarly embarrassed. My greatest solicitude and efforts have scarcely satisfied the common 
exigencies of the service ; and I have the mortification to find that, in spite of all my endeavours, the 
difficulties are every day increasing. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly mentioned to your Excellency, 
for some months past, that the supplies of money 
furnished the department were very unequal to the 
current expenses. I have all along flattered myself 
that affairs would take a new and more favorable 
turn. As Congress were deliberating upon the subject of finance, I was led to believe that the schemes 
and plans they were adopting would afford more 
ample relief; and have encouraged the agents, under 
such an expectation, to proceed in the execution of 
the business. They have been enabled to extend 
their credit thus far, so as to keep the wheels in 
motion, hoping not to fail until government could 
find ways and means for furnishing us with cash 
more adequate to the demands. 
</p><p>
But whatever grounds I supposed there were for 
authorizing such expectations, I now find they were 
vain and nugatory. The cloud thickens, and the 
prospects are daily growing darker. There is now 
no hope of cash. The agents are loaded with heavy 
debts, and perplexed with half-finished contracts, and 
the people clamorous for their pay, refusing to proceed in the public business unless their present demands are discharged. The constant run of expenses, 
incident to the department, presses hard for further 
credit., or immediate supplies of money. To extend 
one, is impossible ; to obtain the other, we have not 
the least prospect. I see nothing, therefore, but a 
general check, if not an absolute stop, to the progress of every branch of business in the whole department, I have little reason to hope that, with the 
most favorable disposition in the agents, it will be 
in our power to provide for the occasional demands 
of the army in their present cantonments; much less, 
to have in readiness the necessary apparatus, and 
supplies of different kinds, for putting the army in 
motion at the opening of the campaign. My apprehensions of a failure in these respects are so strong, 
and my anxiety for the consequences so great, that I 
feel it my duty once more to represent to your Excellency our circumstances and prospects. From such a view of our situation, you may be led not to expect more from us than we are able to perform, and 
may have time to take your measures consequent 
upon such information. 
</p><p>
I know not whether government can command such 
sums of money as are necessary for the current expenses of the nation ; but it is a folly to expect that 
this expensive department can be long supported on 
credit. A further attempt would only bring ruin and 
distress upon ourselves, without affording any substantial advantage, either to the public or the army ; 
and, therefore, I think it highly necessary, as all military movements are under your immediate direction, 
and as the affairs of this department are intimately 
connected with all the active operations, that you 
should have a right understanding with Administration, with respect to the support they can give. 
in executing the measures you may think proper to 
take. 
There is no deficiency in the resources of the 
country. On the contrary, I have authentic reasons 
to conclude the country is more plentifully stored 
with every material necessary for the provision and 
support of an army, than it has been for three years 
past. The defect lies in a want of proper means to 
draw them into public use. I cannot see how a remedy will be applied to this evil in the present management of finance. The wretched state in which 
that is involved, creates HCAV obstructions, and an ac 
cumulation of expenses in every branch of the department. 
</p><p>
Hitherto our principal difficulty has arose from a 
want of proper supplies of money, and from the inefficacy of that which we obtained ; but now there 
appears a scene opening which will introduce new 
embarrassments. The Congress have recommended to 
the different States to take upon themselves the furnishing certain species of supplies for our department. The recommendation falls far short of the 
general detail of the business, the difficulty of ad 
justing which, between the different agents as well 
as the different authorities from which they derive 
their appointments, I am very apprehensive will introduce some jarring interests, many improper disputes, 
as well as dangerous delays. Few persons, who have 
not a competent knowledge of this employment, can 
form any tolerable idea of the arrangements necessary to give despatch and success in discharging the 
duties of the office, or see the necessity for certain 
relations and dependencies. The great exertions 
which are frequently necessary to be made, require 
the whole machine to be moved by one common interest, and directed to one general end. How far the 
present measures, recommended to the different States, 
are calculated to promote these desirable purposes, I 
cannot pretend to say; but there appears to me such a maze, from the mixed modes adopted by some 
States, and about to be adopted by others, that I 
cannot see the channels, through which the business 
may be conducted, free from disorder and confusion. 
</p><p>
It would be a folly for me to attempt to change 
the general disposition of mankind, or to flatter my 
self with the hopes of a different conduct from those 
who may be employed in the various branches of the 
department, than what is known to influence and 
govern men. If experiments are necessary, I have 
not the least objections to their being made ; but I 
cannot agree to be responsible for the consequences. 
If government is distressed, and these expedients are 
requisite for her relief, my aid shall not be wanting, 
during my stay in the department, to give them a 
fair and full operation ; but I cannot say that I think 
they will either answer the expectations of the pub 
lic, or prove competent to the demands of the army. 
</p><p>
It cannot be more disagreeable to your Excellency 
to receive, than it is to me to make, so unfavorable a representation. I have left no steps unattempted, 
that appeared calculated to put affairs on a more 
prosperous footing; and I have hoped that every 
succeeding account would be more promising than the 
last. I should betray my trust, were I to amuse your Excellency with hopes and encouragements; and I 
beg that this description of my department may not 
only be considered as justly drawn, but dictated by 
motives of duty, and aiming at the advantage of the 
public. I am, with great respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
