SIR, 
</p><p>
Upon my return last night from Coeyman's, I had the pleasure 
to receive your Excellency's letter of the 30th of last month. If 
Sir Henry Clinton is directed to reenforce the army of Sir William Howe, which I believe to be the case, he will either land 
his troops at Amboy, and march by the lower road to Mount 
Holly, to support any designed attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, and the 
fortified pass of the Delaware River ; or he will land at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, and march by Brunswic and <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, in order to facilitate Sir William Howe's retreat across the Delaware, 
and through the Jerseys. In either attempt, I am clearly of opinion that all the troops I sent to your assistance, with all that 
can properly, from your neighbourhood, be added to them, should 
march without delay to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, and for their further operations, be governed, in great measure, by the movements of the 
enemy. Of these, the Commanding Officer should procure the 
best intelligence. 
</p><p>
If Sir Henry Clinton marches towards Mount Holly, our army 
will, of course, move directly to <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, and hang upon his 
rear and right flank. If he marches towards <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, our army 
will march to Somerset Court-House, and be ready to move, as he 
moves, towards <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> ; our General carefully acquainting General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> with his own, and the enemy's motions, and receiving his directions for the cooperation of his army. 
</p><p>
The Governor of the Jerseys should, at the same time, be 
requested to order the militia of that State to second the motions 
of our army. If Colonel Morgan and his rifle regiment have 
marched, it would be right to send an express to stop them at 
Van Camp's, and order him to march from thence to Sussex 
Court-House and <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>. 
</p><p>
The heavy brass artillery I sent down the river, should be sent 
up again by water, or so disposed as to be secured from any 
surprise. The light brass field-guns, which you mentioned in a 
former letter, should be sent with the troops to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>. I 
have the best reason to believe, that, with the troops I have 
here, I can secure every thing this way until June, and perhaps 
do more. 
</p><p>
If the public affairs of this State do not require your Excellency's immediate attendance upon them, I wish you could be 
spared to command the army to be assembled at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>. 
But if your meeting the Legislature here cannot be dispensed 
with, I wish General Parsons might be ordered for that service, 
and now take the liberty to recommend it to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a> by 
this express. Nevertheless, I wish you would immediately cross 
the river to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a>, and show him this letter, and confer with him upon this important movement of the troops. 
</p><p>
As I have sent <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a> a very fine brigade from 
hence, with two excellent regiments of Connecticut militia, I 
think he will be able to spare one brigade of Continental troops 
from his side, with General Parsons. 
</p><p>
I utterly disapprove of any attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, knowing 
that while the enemy s" ships of force occupy the East and North 
Rivers, and there is a tolerable garrison on the Isthmus, the 
taking the city would be very doubtful ; and, when taken, it 
would be found without any military stores of consequence ; for 
those, you may be assured, are afloat; and it is also so commanded from the water, that it cannot be held, until we are 
superior at sea. 
</p><p>
If you cannot wait upon <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a> yourself, send him .a 
copy of this letter, and your sentiments thereupon, with my letter 
to him inclosed. I am, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
