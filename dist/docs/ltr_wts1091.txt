My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
Leaving the seasons to look after themselves, I'll try and 
give you an idea of how our days pass in a garrison like 
this. Here at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort moultrie" rel="city">Fort Moultrie</a> we have about 250 soldiers, 
divided into four companies. These are quartered some 
inside the wall, some outside. All the unmarried officers 
eight of us live inside ; all the married, five, outside. 
This being the headquarters of the regiment, we have 
the Colonel and his band of about fifteen instruments. 
Every morning at daylight all get up at reveille, attend a 
drill, either as infantry or artillery, at sunrise ; breakfast 
at seven, have a dress parade at eight, and half an hour 
after the new guard takes the place of the old one, a 
new officer relieving the old one. After that each one 
kills time to suit himself till reveille of next morning 
commences the new routine. Thus it is every fair day 
except Sunday, when we have an extra quantity of music, 
parade, and inspection in honor of the day and to keep 
our men in superfine order at church. Thus, you see 
that every day at nine o'clock and after we have nothing 
to do but amuse ourselves. Some read, some write, some 
loaf, and some go to the city. For the latter class a 
barge is in attendance, going and coming. Although six 
miles from a city, we have all its advantages, whilst separated from its annoying noises, taxes, and expenses. . . . 
During the past winter I have been at North Carolina 
twice, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a> once, and at Charleston some hundred 
times. The fact is, in the summer time we are so enveloped with citizens that we have to make acquaintances 
whether or no. When they move to Charleston and the 
country, they send invitations which must be accepted, or 
give offence. The consequence was that two or more of 
us had to go constantly as representatives of the whole, 
always in rotation, unless duty or pleasure coincided, 
when a greater number would cross the water. These 
parties are very various, from the highly aristocratic and 
fashionable, with sword and epaulettes, or horse-racing, 
picnicing, boating, fishing, swimming, and God knows 
what not. A life of this kind does .well enough for a 
while, but soon surfeits with its flippancy, mingling 
with people in whom you feel no permanent interest, 
smirks and smiles when you feel savage, tight boots 
when your fancy would prefer slippers. I want relief, 
and unless they can invent a new Florida war I'll come 
back and spend a few months with you in Ohio. But as 
my visits have been, heretofore, in the spring and summer, I'll wait for the fall this time, when I hope once 
more to see you all at home and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a> both. . . . 
Your affectionate brother,
