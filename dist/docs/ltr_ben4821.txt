DEAR FRIEND 
</p><p>
Thro' Storms and Floods I arrived here on Saturday 
night, late, and was lodg'd miserably at an Inn: But that 
excellent Christian David Hume, agreable to the Precepts 
of the Gospel, has received the Stranger, and I now live with 
him at his House in the new Town most happily. I purpose 
staying about a Fortnight, and shall be glad to hear from you. 
I congratulate you on certain political Events that I know 
give you Pleasure. Let me know how it is with you and 
yours, how my Wife does and Sir John Pringle, and our other 
Friends. 
With sincerest Esteem I am, my dear Friend 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN
