My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
As we shall probably move to-morrow, I w r rite to 
inform you that I must be obliged to use your horses 
and servant farther on there having been no possibility of supplying myself with these articles here. 
Shrewsberry says his hat was violently taken from 
him by some soldiers, as he was carrying his horses 
to water. If James will be so good as to send him 
his old laced hat by the bearer, I hope he will take 
better care of it, 
</p><p>
If the enemy have a design upon Charles Town 
which does not so clearly appear to me as it does 
to most people, I hope we shall ruin the northern 
branch of their army, and that however they may 
for a while distress an individual state, their efforts 
against the general confederacy will be less likely to succeed than ever. I commend myself to your love and remain 
</p><p>
Your ever affectionate 
</p><p>
