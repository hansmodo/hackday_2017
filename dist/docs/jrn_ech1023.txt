All things being in readiness yesterday morning and the weather being propitious, we again started on the march with the four other teams. Our course lay nearly due east, and we soon commenced ascending high, steep and rugged hills where the scrubby oak was rivalled by the pine. In climbing some of the steep hills our camp kettle with some well-cooked beef and pork again slipped off the guide-pole, upon which it was hanging, and when we stopped to take a little dinner and looked for it, it wasn't there. As we advanced, the country became still more rugged and uneven. The peaks of some of the loftiest mountains we were crossing were covered with snow, and their sides thickly studded with brushwood. While in the States, we often read of the lofty pine and redwood that abounded so plentifully in California, but I have now travelled over nearly 300 miles through the country without seeing the first sign of anything like stately
timber, and am therefore led to believe that fine timber is the exception and found only in limited quantities.

On account of the rain which fell yesterday afternoon and evening, the roads were bad and slippery, and we got on but slowly on our tramp today. We had not proceeded far until we saw the huge tracks of a grizzly bear that had crossed the road on his way to some of the hills by which we were surrounded. About ten o'clock we reached the top of a high hill from which a beautiful view was presented. A little way before us lay stretched out for many miles a range, the summits of which were covered with a sheet of white snow; and far beyond could be seen the high peaks of the Sierra Nevada, situatedin the region of eternal snow. A heavy cloud had for a moment obscured the sun and as it passed off, the distant snow-clad mountains shone and glistened as though they were formed of pure silver.

We passed a branch of the Agua Frio Mines where a number of French and Mexicans were industriously engaged digging and washing out the sand. They were making but little. About three in the afternoon we reached a good camping ground in the midst of the Mariposa Diggings and pitched our tent in the woods near the base of a high hill. I then sallied forth in search of stores and found several. I purchased 1/4 pound of saleratus at $2.50 per pound. Molasses is worth $6 per gallon and brandy $3 per bottle. For flour I paid 50 cents per pound and 62 1/2 cents for pork. I then returned to camp and prepared some cakes for supper. My companions are both sick and rather down in spirits.

Atkins turned in early as usual and soon after he had lain down he hollered out for me to come into the tent, and upon going in andenquiring the cause, I
found that a large red lizard six or eight inches long had taken possession of our bed. I soon made the creature vamos!
<p></p>
I have had but little time or opportunity to learn much about the mines further than that they are very rich. According to some rules in force here, each man is allowed twenty feet on each bank of the river, that is if he can get it, but for miles the river is staked off and every foot apparently taken up, so it is very difficult to get a place. We are here with about ten dollars each in our pockets, two out of three in ill health, provisions very high, and getting a hole difficult; all added make our prospects a little gloomy, but still I am not disposed to give up or despair. This evening I am tired and sleepy and intend taking one of Dr. Nelson's pills upon going to bed.
