My Dear Brother : Since I received your last letter I 
have been so constantly engaged, first with the election 
and afterwards in arranging my business for the winter, 
that I could not write you. 
</p><p>
The election resulted as I all along supposed. Indeed, 
the division of the Democratic party on precisely the 
same question that separates the Republican party from 
the Democratic party made its defeat certain. The success of the Republicans has no doubt saved the country 
from a discreditable scramble in the House. No doubt 
the disorders of the last winter and the fear of their 
renewal induced many good citizens to vote for the 
Republican ticket. With a pretty good knowledge of the 
material of our House, I would far prefer that any one 
of the candidates be elected by the people rather than 
allow the contest to be determined in Congress. Well, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Lincoln</a> is elected. No doubt, a large portion of the 
citizens of Louisiana consider this a calamity. If they 
believe their own newspapers, what is far worse, the 
lying organs of the Democratic party in the free States, 
they have just cause to think so. But you were long 
enough in Ohio and heard enough of the ideas of the 
Republican leaders to know that the Republican party 
is not likely to interfere directly or indirectly with 
slavery in the States or with the laws relating to slavery ; 
that, so far as the slavery question is concerned, the contest was for the possession of Kansas and perhaps New 
Mexico, and that the chief virtue of the Republican success 
was in its condemnation of the narrow sectionalism of 
Buchanan's administration and the corruptions by which 
he attempted to sustain his policy. Who doubts but 
that, if he had been true to his promises in submitting 
the controversy in Kansas to its own people, and had 
closed it by admitting Kansas as a free State, that the 
Democratic party would have retained its power? It 
was his infernal policy in Kansas (I can hardly think of 
the mean and bad things he allowed there without swearing) that drove off Douglas, and led to the division of 
the Democratic party and the consequent election of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Lincoln</a>. 
</p><p>
As a matter of course, I rejoice in the result, for in my 
judgment the administration of Lincoln will do much to 
dissipate the feeling in the South against the North by 
showing what are the real purposes of the Eepublican 
party. In the meantime, it is evident we have to meet 
in a serious form the movements of South Carolinian 
Disunionists. These men have for years desired this disunion ; they have plotted for it. They drove Buchanan 
into his Kansas policy ; they got up this new dogma 
about slave protection ; they broke up the Charleston 
Convention merely to advance secession ; they are now 
hurrying forward excited men into acts of treason without giving time for passion to cool or reason to resume 
its sway. God knows what will be the result. If by a 
successful revolution they can go out of the Union, they 
establish a principle that will break up the government 
into fragments. Some local disaffection or temporary 
excitement will lead one State after another out of the 
Union. We will have the Mexican Republic over again, 
with a fiercer race of men to fight with each other. Secession is revolution. They seem bent upon attempting 
it. If so, shall the government resist? If so, then 
comes civil war, a fearful subject for Americans to 
think of. 
</p><p>
Since the election I have been looking over the field 
for the purpose of marking out a course to follow this 
winter, and I have, as well as I could, tested my political 
course in the past. There has been nothing done by the 
Republican party but merits the cordial approval of my 
judgment. There have been many things said and done 
by Republican leaders that I utterly detest. Many of 
the dogmas of the Democratic party I like, but their conduct in fact in administering the government, and especially in their treatment of the slavery question, I detest. 
I know we will have trouble this winter, but I intend to 
be true to the moderate conservative course I think I 
have hitherto undertaken. Whatever may be the consequences, I will insist on preserving the unity of the 
States, and all the States without exception and without 
regard to consequences. If any Southern State has 
really suffered any injury or is deprived of any right, I 
will help redress the injury and secure the right. They 
must not, merely because they are beaten in an election, 
or have failed in establishing slavery where it was prohibited by compromise, attempt to break up the government. If they will hold on a little while, they will 
find no injury can come to them unless, by their repeated 
misrepresentation of us, they stir up their slaves to insurrection. I still hope that no State will follow in the 
wake of South Carolina. If so, the weakness of her 
position will soon bring her back again or subject her to 
ridicule and insignificance.

It may be supposed by some that the excitement in the 
South has produced a corresponding excitement in the 
North. This is true in financial matters, especially in 
the cities. In political circles, it only strengthens the 
Republican party. Even Democrats of all shades say, 
The election is against us ; we will submit and all must 
submit. Kepublicans say, The policy of the government 
has been controlled by the South for years, and we have 
submitted : now they must submit. And why not ? 
What can the Kepublicans do half as bad as Pierce and 
Buchanan have done ? 
</p><p>
But enough of this. You luckily are out of politics, 
and don't sympathize with my Republicanisms any way ; 
but as we are on the eve of important events, I write 
about politics instead of family matters, of which there 
is notliing new. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
