LOS ANGELES, November 18th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>.
</p><p>
From Anaheim we returned by stage to this ancient City of the Angels. Myself, wife, and an Englishman were the only passengers who took seats in the coach at Anaheim. The coachman, accompanied with an armed guard, sat on the outside. The distance between the two cities is about forty miles, and the region through which we had to pass, is for the most part wild and uninhabited. A few weeks prior to this time the stage coach had been waylaid on this route, and all the passengers robbed of their money and other valuables.
</p><p>
When we arrived at the first station, a man of middle age took passage with us. His manner of entering the coach and his general appearance, were anything but prepossessing. He looked rough, seedy and sunburnt, but said nothing. I soon discovered that he carried in a leathern belt,
beneath his coat, a bowie knife and pistol, which, in his restless movements, were exposed to view. This gave the Englishman, as well as myself and wife, some uneasiness in regard to his real character and intentions. His face wore a fiendish expression, as he scanned us occasionally with a critical eye. He seemed puzzled to determine in his own mind who we were, or where to place us. At last, addressing first the Englishman, and then myself, he asked where we resided. The Englishman replied at Los Angeles. Regarding this as the most politic reply, I made the same answer. He evidently doubted, but made no further enquiries. We were now passing the most desolate part of the route, a marshy tract of country, full of ambuscades. Here he thrust his head, every few moments, outside the coach, looking this way and that way, intently and anxiously, as if expecting aid or pursuit, and then would nervously place his hand on his pistol and adjust it to his right side, where he could readily grasp it at any moment.
</p><p>
In a short time we emerged into an open plain of vast extent, bordered by the spurs of the neighboring mountains on our right. Here we saw two sinister looking Mexicans, who were mounted on horses and belted with pistols, heading in the direction of the mountains. Our seedy fellow-passenger watched their movements with intense
interest, and with evident disappointment. Why they were objects of so much interest to him, or what connection they might have had with him, is more than I can say. But his appearance and the circumstances gave us unpleasant impressions, and, in fact, somewhat alarmed us. The Englishman, like myself, was unarmed. He had but recently arrived from England, and was possessed of considerable money, which he desired to invest in California lands. This I had learned from him before leaving Anaheim, and thought it possible the fact might be known to our suspicious looking fellow-passenger. But when we reached the outskirts of the city, he leaped like a tiger from the coach and disappeared. We all felt relieved, and congratulated ourselves on the happy riddance. The next day we heard that he was one of the bandits who, a few weeks previously, had waylaid the stage in the night, at a point near the city, and plundered the passengers. He had agreed, it was said, to turn State's evidence against his associates in crime, who had been arrested, and thus secure his own escape from the penalties of the law. For having made this agreement, he probably feared assassination by the hand of some one who belonged to the same secret organization as himself. It was mainly on his testimony that his comrades were convicted, and sent in chains to
the penitentiary. In a few weeks afterwards the witness himself was shot by some unknown person, and left to die by the wayside, near the identical spot where he had assisted in committing the original robbery.
</p><p>
While remaining at Los Angeles, we visited some of the spots of the most interest--the court house--the old cathedral, built in 1773, and the hill that overlooks the town, where Gen. Fremont, in the war with Mexico, entrenched the forces under his command, and held the city in subjection. The entrenchments are still to be seen. While here, the General observed symptoms of revolt in the movements of the Catholic priesthood, on a Sunday, at the church, under the guise of religious services; and seeing armed men passing in and out, ordered a cannon shot to be fired in that direction, which struck the gable-end window and passed through the church, in the walls of which the ball-hole still remains visible. The result was a grand scare, short prayers, and a sudden exit of the congregation. This unexpected mixture of prayers and powder did not agree very well with either the religious views or patriotic feelings of the Mexicans. The last battle with the Mexicans, which occurred in this region, was fought on the banks of the river San Gabriel, within a few miles of the city. This proved decisive. Annexation
soon followed. But many of the richer Mexicans disliked annexation, and removed to Mexico. Those who remained, still retain their former habits and customs. Their principal occupation seems to be idling, gambling, racing, cock-fighting and drinking.
</p><p>
The main street of the city is about a mile long. The south half is occupied almost exclusively by Mexicans; the north half mostly by Americans. The style of building distinguishes very plainly the difference in taste and character of the two nationalities. In the immediate neighborhood of the city are several very fine fruit orchards and gardens, which are much visited and admired by strangers. We have met, while here, several southern gentlemen, who were distinguished officers in the war of the Rebellion, and who have located themselves on ranches near Los Angeles, and are now engaged in growing wool and fine horses. They are gentlemen in every sense of the word, and submit to the new condition of things with becoming grace and a genial temper. They say they prefer a whiteman's government, and confidently predict that negro-freedom will prove a failure--a misfortune, alike, both to the white and the black race.
</p><p>
The Union Hotel has the lead. Here we find the best of company and the best of
accomodations. There are several other good hotels, all of which, as well as the Union, are overflowing with guests at the present time. You will see here but very few ladies, either at the hotels or on the streets. There is just now a rush of adventurers and land speculators to this point, who are attempting to make fortunes by overreaching each other. Yet we have noticed the arrival of some families, who propose to become permanent citizens. City lots have advanced rapidly within the last few months, and the prospect of a railway connecting San Diego and Los Angeles with San Francisco, has had a magic effect in directing public attention to this region. The citizens here are jubilant, and seem disposed to indulge in extravagant expectations. As yet, however, business appears to be done on a limited scale. The merchants, small and large, occupy main street. More than half the shops are devoted to the sale of fruits, refreshments, or whiskey, interspersed with an undue proportion of gambling saloons. In and about these shops you meet with all nationalities, and a mixture of all colors. Nearly all the living languages of Europe, Asia and America, are spoken here. It is somewhat difficult to distinguish the Indians from the Mexicans, the two races have become so intermixed. There is a large ranch, consisting, as we are told, of a hundred thousand
acres or more, situated just north of the city, which is owned by an Indian, an old chief, who refuses to sell it or any part of it to a white man, fearing if he were to do so, that some sudden calamity would befall him and the remnant of his race. This refusal seriously retards the progress of the city, as well as the adjoining country. The old chief lives on a slender income from his herds of cattle and horses, or rather from the few which are not stolen from him. The white citizens are attempting to force him to sell his lands, by laws imposing a high rate of taxation.

Los Angeles is the central point of business operations in Southern California. The lands that surround it are fertile and desirable, and must eventually become valuable. In fact, all the valley lands among the neighboring mountains are rich in point of soil, and only wait the advent of the agriculturalist to give ample evidence of their capabilities and productions. About sixty miles south-easterly from the city, there is an extensive tract of rich, level land, known as the San Bernardino Valley. The climate is delightful the year round, and thither the swelling tide of emigration, with a view to actual settlement, is at present directed. Every one who has visited this beautiful valley, speaks of it in glowing terms. The lands can be obtained at Government price,
or by acquiring pre-emption rights. There is more or less valuable timber to be found in the gorges of the mountains, and much of the land can be irrigated by diverting the natural streams of water.
</p><p>
But, at present, the valley is somewhat difficult of access, and far from market. The roads are simply trails, and exceedingly rough along the mountain passes. Yet a good many families have already settled there, and will ultimately realize their most sanguine expectations, if one may judge from the expression of common sentiment in regard to the promising future of that region. The adjoining mountains are said to be rich in mineral wealth, such as coal, gold and iron. Our stage acquaintance, the Englishman, had visited this valley, and was quite enchanted with its fertility and beauty. He regretted the want of law and order, and related an occurrence which took place while he was there. A traveler, on horse-back, while approaching the valley through a mountain gorge, was attacked by three ruffians, robbed of his money, watch, horse and clothing, and left to find his way, as best he could, to some habitation. In the wilder portions of California, crimes of this character are committed almost daily. Pistols and pluck are the only safe-guards on which you can rely in such emergencies. It is
never safe here to go unarmed, or travel alone, especially if you are well dressed, or display golden ornaments on your person.
</p><p>
Here I must conclude for the present. At eleven this morning we leave the city for San Francisco; by rail to Wilmington, and thence by sea. It is Thanksgiving Day, and I know not where we shall dine; certainly not with our old tried friends at home. Pleasant, indeed, are the many reminiscences connected with the thanksgivings of the past; the intermingling at the old homestead of youth and age, eating, drinking, laughing, joking, dancing and story-telling. O, that I were at home and young again--wouldn't I have a gay old time of it? Good bye!
