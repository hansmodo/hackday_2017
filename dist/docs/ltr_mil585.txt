<p><i>[Mildred Childe Lee (1846-1905) was the youngest daughter of General Robert E. Lee and his wife, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="me">Mary Custis Lee</a>. Robert E. Lee had nicknames for all four of his daughters, and he called Mildred "Life" or "Precious Life."</i>

<i>Mildred Lee wrote this letter on October 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1882">1882</a> at the age of 36. She congratulates her cousin, Edmund Jennings Lee, on the birth of his daughter. She writes "now that you have a daughter's future before you, I advise you to leave mine alone-it being past redemption." Though Mildred never married, she encouraged Edmund to see that his daughter "marries at 18 a well-to-do man...not a broken down scum." She also mentions a ride with a potential suitor, David Moore and laments that "I alone, among the mortals, am unable to wed." Obvious in this letter are Mildred's feelings of loneliness and her desire to marry. However, in nineteenth century America, Mildred was considered to be a spinster, and well past the age when most women married. Her three sisters, Annie, Agnes and Mary, also never married.</i>

My dear Ned
</p><p>
I see that the cares of a family have not added to your dignity nor lessened your frivolity! Now that you have a daughter's future before you, I advise you to let mine alone-it being past redemption. See that she marries at 18 to a well-to-do man like Mr. Philips-not a broken down scum of an effete aristocracy! As to my "wrappers" I have added to my store & now appear morning--noon--night in the most seductive négligés. I still wear the old red in the sanctity of my chamber. I shall not forget to look in upon you, when I pass thro your village & whenever you care for gay society - come here. I took a long ride yesterday-David Moore my cavalier! To such extremes am I reduced! To day is Dr. Martin's wedding day! It seems that I alone, among the mortals am unable to wed.
</p><p>
I send you the autographs & wish it was a clearer one but it is all I have--
</p><p>
Kiss the baby for me & give my kindest remembrances & congratulations to the Mama--
</p><p>
Yrs Always Sincerely-
</p><p>
