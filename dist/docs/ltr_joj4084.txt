Madam, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter which you did me the honour 
to write on the 15th April last. Few circumstances could 
have given me more pleasure than such evidence of my 
having a place in the remembrance and good opinion of a 
ladv, whose esteem derives no less value from her discernment, than from the delicacy of her sentiments. 
</p><p>
Accept therefore, madam, of my sincere and cordial 
acknowledgments for honouring me with a place among 
your correspondents ; which was the more obliging, as you 
was to afford more pleasure by, than you could expect to 
receive from it. You know it is an old observation, that 
ladies write better letters than gentlemen, and therefore, 
independent of other considerations, a correspondence between them is always so far on unequal terms. 
</p><p>
I can easily conceive that you, whose predilection for 
your husband was always conspicuous, should experience 
so much satisfaction on seeing him return from this, his field 
of glory, with additional honours ; and I can, with equal 
ease, form an idea of his emotions, when on that, as on 
former occasions, those honours promoted him to higher 
rank in your estimation. 
</p><p>
Your remarks on the marquis's affection for his children, 
and the value you set on domestic enjoyments, must be 
pleasing to those who are capable of feeling their force. 
</p><p>
I assure you I rejoice in the prospect you have of extending, through your branch, the reputation of both your 
families ; and you have my best wishes, that the latest historian may say of your descendants, that all the men were 
as valiant and worthy as their ancestor, who will probably 
be distinguished by the appellation of Americanus, and all 
the women as virtuous and amiable as his lady. 
</p><p>
If you was not what you are, I would not encourage the 
desire you express of accompanying the marquis on his 
next visit to this country, for I am sure you would be disappointed. 
</p><p>
We have few amusements to relieve travellers of that 
weight of time and leisure which oppresses many of them. 
Our men, for the most part, mind their business, and our 
women their families ; and if our wives succeed (as most 
of them do) in " making home man's best delight," gallantry 
seldom draws their husbands from them. 
</p><p>
Our customs, in many respects, differ from yours, and 
you know that, whether with or without reason, we usually 
prefer those which education and habit recommend. The 
pleasures of Paris and the pomp of Versailles are unknown 
in this country, and their votaries must unavoidably experience a certain vacuity or blank here, which nothing but 
good sense, moderate desires, and a relish for less splendid, 
less various, but not less innocent or satisfactory enjoyments 
can supply. Though not a Frenchman, I should, nevertheless, be too polite to tell these things to those whom they 
might restrain from visiting us. Cn you they will have a 
contrary effect. It would gratify the friends of the marquis, viz., the citizens of the United States, to have the 
honour of a visit from you. I flatter myself that consideration will afford a strong additional inducement. 
</p><p>
My little family is well. Mrs. Jay desires me to assure 
you of her remembrance and regard ; and permit me to 
add, that I am, with sincere esteem and respectful attachment, 
</p><p>
Madam, your most obedient, and 
</p><p>
Very humble servant, 
</p><p>
