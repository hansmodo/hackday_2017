Dear Brother : In my letter a few days since, I referred to a letter of Hon. Thad. Stevens. I meant, of 
course, Hon. A. H. Stephens of Georgia. I now enclose a copy of that letter under cover of a note to Col. 
R. N. Scott, in charge of the General Kecords. I want 
you to read that letter carefully and then send it to 
Scott to be preserved among the archives. Such letters contain more real truth than official papers. It was 
from such papers that I gained the most valuable information of the actual condition of facts. Hundreds of 
similar letters reached me, and I fear we were not careful enough in their preservation. 
</p><p>
They make up the unwritten history or traditions of 
the war, one of the principal objects of the Grand Army 
of the Republic. Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
