MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE this day, by special permission from their majesties, obtained by Mr. West, the painter, who with 
Mr. Copley does so much honor to our country, seen 
the apartments in the Queen's house, as it is called, 
or Buckingham House. It is a great curiosity indeed. 
There is an inestimable collection of paintings by the 
greatest masters, Raphael, Rubens, Vandyke and 
many others. There is one room which the King 
calls Mr. West's, as it is ornamented with a collection 
of his works the return of Regulus the death of Epaminondas the death of Bayard the death of 
General Wolf, &c. 
</p><p>
The cartons of Raphael are a wonderful production of art. The library is the most elegant thing I 
ever saw. But the King's military and naval room 
pleased me best, as it is a collection of plans and 
models of every dockyard and man of war in his 
empire. Come to Europe with Abby as soon as possible, and satisfy your curiosity, and improve your taste 
by viewing these magnificent scenes. Go to the 
play. See the paintings and buildings. Visit the 
manufactures for a few months ; and then, if Congress 
pleases, return to America with me to reflect upon them. I am in earnest. I cannot be happy nor tolerable without you. Besides, I really think one trip 
across the sea would be of service to you and my 
daughter, to whom my love. I shall expect you constantly until you arrive. 
</p><p>
I mourn the loss of my father, but it was time to 
expect it from his age. You must be melancholy and afflicted, and I hope that the voyage will divert your 
thoughts. Mr. Thaxter is in America before this, no 
doubt. My dear son is the only secretary I have or 
propose to have at present. I believe I shall go to 
the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> and reside chiefly there ; but write to me, 
until you embark, by Portugal, Spain, France, England or Holland. The nearer you arrive to the 
<a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, the nearer I believe you will be to me, yet I 
may be in Paris. I shall stay but a short time in 
<a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. You will read in the newspapers innumerable lies about Jay and me. Regard them as little 
as I do. I have met with an agreeable reception 
here, as agreeable as I wish ; in short I have been received here exactly as I wished to be. 
</p><p>
Yours, with tenderness unutterable,
