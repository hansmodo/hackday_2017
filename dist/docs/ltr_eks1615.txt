CAMP AT BRASOS ST. IAGO, 
February 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
I closed my letter yesterday just after our arrival 
at this place. After writing, I went to an oyster house 
with my second lieutenant, Farrelly, where we took 
as many of the natives as was convenient. They were 
excellent and were a real treat after the hard bread 
and pork on which we have been regaling for months. 
This morning at daylight we struck our tents and 
prepared to embark immediately. The wind rose, 
however, before the lighters were ready for us, and 
we again encamped. I was sent to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a> with 
a few men to search for deserters. I had a pleasant 
sail in a small sloop, found Dr. Wood there in fine 
health, and old , bewigged and as complimentary 
as of yore, transacted my business and returned by 
two in the afternoon to Brasos.

This large Depot is now the scene of the most utter 
confusion imaginable. Quarter-masters, wagon-masters, wharf-masters and government agents of all 
descriptions running about as if mad, while orders 
upon orders and counter-orders are constantly issued. 
An exemplification of a scene in " Charles O Malley." 
Enter sergeant with a large bundle of papers under 
each arm.

Officer: What have you under your right arm ? 
</p><p>
Sergeant: Orders. 
</p><p>
Officer: And what under your left ? 
</p><p>
Sergeant: Counter-orders.

February 18. The regiment got off in two steamers, 
the " Anson " and " Augusta " and before three in 
the afternoon were on board the ship " Huron," which 
was at anchor some eight miles at sea. We are all 
much disappointed in our vessel. She is much smaller 
and worse found than we anticipated. She was prepared for only two hundred and eighty-eight men and 
fourteen officers, whereas four hundred men and 
twenty-one officers have been put on board. Every 
thing is much crowded and the accommodations 
totally inadequate. Fortunately, it is very calm, and 
we hope to get things stowed tomorrow so as to make 
all more comfortable. The ship under the command 
of Captain N. G. Weeks was got under way about 
four in the afternoon. There was a light north wind, 
and she stood upon her course south southeast for 
Lobos. Notwithstanding that the sea was smooth 
and I could not perceive that the vessel rolled at all, 
many were very sick and were " casting up their 
accounts " in a manner by no means agreeable. 
</p><p>
February ig. We have thus far been fanned along 
by gentle breezes. About noon the wind came ahead, 
blowing from the southeast, changing our course to 
east by north half north. Our table on board is very 
good in every other respect we are exceedingly uncomfortable, much crowded, the men terribly so. I 
fear the worst consequences should we be long on 
board in this climate. Scott, Merrill, Ruggles, Rosencrantz, and some others suffer much from sea sickness. 
I, you know, am exempt from that affliction. I pass 
nearly all my time on deck reading, the captain having quite a supply of books. I am by hours the last 
at night to leave the deck; seated alone on the taffrail 
I gaze upon the beautiful moon and stars or down 
into the sparkling sea. . . . 
</p><p>
February 22. At six this morning, when I awoke, 
everything was pitching about, the ship rolling at a 
terrible rate. By dead reckoning the captain estimated that we were in the latitude of Lobos. I found 
on coming on deck that we were heading west. At 
eleven in the morning the low sandy shore of Mexico 
came in view. I climbed to the masthead with the 
captain to con the shore. I am the only officer on 
board enough of a sailor to undertake this feat. I 
often go to the top to avoid the sickness and confusion 
of the deck. We lay over the fore top-gallant yard 
more than an hour, nearly one hundred feet from the 
deck, while the good ship was flying over the sea 
urged by half a gale of wind. The shore became every 
moment more distinct and soon the Island of Lobos 
appeared with its fleet of transports. We stood away 
to the south and at about noon we were about six 
miles from the Island, when from my position I could 
see that the vessels belonging to the navy were firing 
the national salute for Washington s birthday. At 
two in the afternoon we dropped our anchor among 
a large fleet of ships rolling in the heavy sea, near the 
" Massachusetts," on board of which are General 
Scott and staff. The little Isle of Lobos looks like a 
green speck gemming the bosom of the ocean. It is in 
fact but a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth, 
and affords but a poor lea in a norther, the only gales 
which we are likely to encounter here. Its beach is 
now covered with the tents of various volunteer 
regiments.

February 23. This morning the weather is mild, 
the sea running down. I went on board the " Massa 
chusetts " where I found Uncle Edmund in fine spirits 
and merry as ever. He thinks there will be no fight 
at Vera Cruz. Nous verrons. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> is in 
high spirits, talking in his usual vein. 
</p><p>
February 25. Today a sad accident happened on 
board. A block fell from masthead, knocking down 
three men and mortally wounding Leach of my company. Since one o clock he has been insensible and 
I think will not last till morning. 
</p><p>
February 26. Leach died during the night and I 
was ordered to go ashore and select a spot for his 
grave, but there was such a gale blowing from the 
north, that it was not practicable to land. All day 
the transports have been arriving, coming down be 
fore the gale like race horses. The First, Second, and 
Seventh Infantry from Tampico are here. In the 
afternoon the wind having lulled a little, I landed with 
a small party to dig a grave, and after selecting a 
suitable spot I walked about the Island which I found 
covered, except where the volunteers had cleared it, 
with a dense growth of tropical trees and plants, most 
of which I had never seen before. The caoutchouc or 
India rubber tree grows here and is the most wonder 
ful vegetable production I have ever seen, answering 
exactly the description of the banyan, its long heavy 
horizontal branches throwing down vertical ones 
which take root in the earth, the whole broad mass of 
branches and foliage being supported by this natural 
colonnade like the dome of a cathedral. On my way 
back to the ship I visited many vessels in search of my 
brother and met many old friends. At last I found 
Edmund on board a little brig with Colonel Plympton, 
and he is now spending the evening with me on board 
the " Huron." He is in fine health and spirits. 
</p><p>
February 27. The gale still continues. I have, 
however, been this morning on the " Massachusetts," 
and have learned that an express vessel is to leave for 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> as soon as the wind shifts. I am, there 
fore, about to close these pages, perchance the last 
you will receive before I land at Anton Lizardo, or San 
Juan. We are confidently assured by officers of the 
navy that they can so cover our landing that we will 
receive no opposition from the Mexicans. This being 
the case, I think, although we may have a tedious siege 
and some hard work in the trenches, there is little to 
be feared for the result. . . . We shall probably sail 
for Anton Lizardo or Sacrificio within a week. It is 
exceedingly inconvenient writing here. Not only is 
the ship crowded beyond description, but she is pitch 
ing in a heavy sea. . . .
