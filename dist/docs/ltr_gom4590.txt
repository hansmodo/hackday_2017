Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to address you a letter on the twenty-second 
of last month, in the close of which I mentioned the intention 
of saying at a future period some few words of the people, who 
are now on the stage. To begin then with our friend Lafayette, 
who has hitherto acted a splendid part. The King obeys but 
detests him. He obeys because he fears. Whoever possesses 
the royal person, may do what he pleases with the royal character and authority. Hence it happens that the ministers are 
of Lafayette's appointment. A short description of their use 
was given the other day by Mirabeau. We make ministers, 
said he, as we used formerly to send servants to keep our boxes 
at the playhouse. I gave you the explanation of this jest while I was in London. Lafayette thinks that these his creatures 
will worship their creator, but he is mightily mistaken. 
</p><p>
You know Duportail, the Minister of War. He is said to be 
violent in favor of the revolution. It is more than a year since I 
have seen him, excepting a short visit of congratulation the other day. My judgment, therefore, should have little weight ; 
but I believe he is too much the friend of liberty to approve of 
the constitution. For the rest ; he has as you know that command of himself, and that simplicity of exterior deportment
which carry a man as far as his abilities will reach. He may 
perhaps remember his creator in his ministerial youth, in order that his days may be long in the land of office ; but I venture to predict, that his duteous observance will not endure one 
half second beyond the moment of necessity. I believe I did not 
mention to you, about a year ago, the intention to appoint him ; 
but at that time I endeavored to take his measure. The minister of the Marine I know nothing about. They say he is a 
good kind of man, which is saying very little. The Keeper of 
the Seals, Monsieur Duport-Dutertre, was a lawyer of eminence thrown up into notice by the circumstances of the moment. He is said to possess both abilities and firmness. Monsieur Delessart, the Minister of the Finances, is rather above 
than below mediocrity, and possesses that kind of civil assent 
which never compromises the possessor, though it seldom travels in company with greatness. 
</p><p>
There is not a man among them fitted for the great tasks in 
which they are engaged, and greater tasks are perhaps impend 
ing. I have no proofs, but I have a well founded opinion, that 
the leaders of one party wish, what those of the other fear, 
and both expect, viz. the interference of foreign powers. One 
previous step would be to carry off, if possible, the King and 
Queen. The latter at least, for there is every reason to apprehend for their safety, should violent measures be adopted while they are here. 
</p><p>
For my own part I do not believe in any such interference, 
neither do I think that the opposers of the Assembly have sufficient energy of character to make a civil war. Their attempts 
if any, will, I imagine, be feeble and consequently ruinous to 
themselves. If indeed they had a considerable part of the 
army, commanded by the Prince of Conde, and the person of 
the King in his possession ; and if they came forward to establish a proper constitution, adopting such good things as the Assembly have done, and rejecting the evil ; then indeed there 
would be different grounds of expectation. But I consider this 
rather as the visionary hope of a few, than as the fixed plan of 
persons who can carry it into execution. I am, &c.
