MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE House of Representatives will do no business, 
with any spirit, before the treaty arrives. The disaffected are intriguing, but accounts from all quarters 
are very discouraging to them. We have been very 
unfortunate in the delays which have attended the despatches of our ambassadors. Very lucky, <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel="child met">Mr. John Quincy Adams</a>, that you are not liable to criticism upon this occasion ! This demurrage would 
have been charged doubly, both to your account and 
that of your father. It would have been a scheme, a 
trick, a design, a contrivance, from hatred to France, 
attachment to England, monarchical manoeuvres, and 
aristocratical cunning ! Oh ! how eloquent they would have been ! 
</p><p>
The southern gentry are playing, at present, a very 
artful game, which I may develope to you in confidence 
hereafter, under the seal of secrecy. Both in conversation and in letters they are representing the Vice 
President as a man of moderation. Although rather 
inclined to limited monarchy, and somewhat attached 
to the English, he is much less so than Jay or Hamilton. For their part, for the sake of conciliation, 
they should be very willing he should be continued as 
Vice President, provided the northern gentlemen 
would consent that Jefferson should be President. I 
most humbly thank you for your kind condescension, Messieurs Transchesapeakes.

Witness my hand, 
</p><p>
