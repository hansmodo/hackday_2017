Sm, 
</p><p>
I have received your Excellency's letter of the 9th 
instant, brought by Colonel Robert Dillon. The legion de Lauzun by this time must be arrived at 
Charlotte Court-House. It will be needful that it 
stay there some time, because the men are almost quite naked, and I shall forward them their clothing 
which I expect from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, as well as that of all 
the army, as soon as possibly can be done after its 
arrival. In these circumstances, I have not thought 
fit to empower M. de Choisy to proceed further, because, on one part, I feared that the requests for that 
movement might not be absolutely necessary, and on 
the other part, I knew too well the ardor and desire 
of going forward, and to be detached from the main 
body, which is natural to our nation. I am here at 
hand to send them orders relative to the intelligence, 
which they will send me from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s army, if the circumstances were so urgent as to render 
their march absolutely necessary. About eight days 
ago, several detachments of different southern regiments, amounting to five hundred men, marched towards that army. In a little excursion I made in 
the heart of the State, I have seen Colonel Armand's legion, at <a href='/results.php?city=charlottesville' rel='city'>Charlottesville</a>. It will be ready in 
a month, if sixty horses, which he expects from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, arrive. If your Excellency does not hurry 
the assembling of the reenforcements, which this 
State is to furnish to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s army, I think 
I ought to let you know, that the Assembly has 
broken up without resolving any thing, or furnishing 
the means of recruiting ; so that it should seem, that 
Virginia, the present moment, looks on itself as in 
possession of peace. 
</p><p>
The privateers are become very bold since the loss 
of the Diligente ; some are entered the Bay. The 
Sybille is gone out to chase them. I presume that, 
before long, we shall receive from France a plan of 
next campaign. In that case, I think it would be 
very necessary that we should have a conference together. I am confident your Excellency would not 
be against seeing <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, your agreeable seat. 
If convenient, it should be our place of rendezvous, 
as the most suitable place, 
</p><p>
I am very sensible to your Excellency's attention 
about the engraving of the field-pieces which you 
destine for me. I do not look upon them as very 
urgent to be delivered ; and I think it would be most 
'suitable to keep them at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, whence Mr. 
Morris might send them to France when peace is 
made. They might be transported to Nantes, whence, 
by going up the river as far as Tours, I would get 
them carried to Rochambeau, which is only twelve 
leagues distant from that city. I am, with respect 
and personal attachment. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=cdr" rel="me">Le <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Compte De Rochambeau</a></a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I think the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a> must, by this time, be on the road to come here ; if he is 
not, I beg you would tell him to have no uneasiness about the privateers, because M. de la Villebrune will take care to see him carried safely over.
