My dear Sister
</p><p>
I have been desiring to write to you for some time but on last Friday week I was very ill with a bilious attack attended with high fever; but as I was with a skillful water cure physician he soon through the blessing of a kind Providence arrested the fever, and on Saturday I was again out doors and am now better than before the attack. I might have written to you last weekend, had I not been anticipating a change from Brattleboro to this place, and I feared that your letter might not reach me in the event of having it directed to that place in the event of my leaving there. Today I came here & am much pleased with things so far. I think that Anna's health as well as my own has improved.
</p><p>
The special object of writing to you at this time is to request you to furnish me with another list of the articles you wish me to get for you &, I wish that you would put them down in the order in which you most desire them, as the amount which you sent (fifty five dollars) will not purchase half of what you named and I am apprehensive that the state of my purse will not allow me to do much for you, though I think that I will be able to do something. I would not trouble you with making out another list, had I not as it appears put those you sent me in such a special safe place of keeping that when I was about to leave home I could not find them myself.

I don't think that I will get you anything at auction. I bought our sofa there & it has turned out a great cheat. If you can't give a full list, let me have the dimensions of the oil cloth. I wrote to you by Mr. Chenoweth & I think requested you to tell me to whom I should send the purchases in Baltimore & also at Grafton. Please let me know soon after receiving this and direct your letter to Round Hill Water Cure, Northampton, Massachusetts. I wish you were here with me, it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. Anna joins me in love to you all.

I am on the West Side of the Connecticut River so you can find me on the map.
