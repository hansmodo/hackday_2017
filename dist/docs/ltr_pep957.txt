Dear Christman:--I have the gratifying announcement to forward to you that your old friend, DeWitt Clinton Atkins, will accompany you on your long journey. I feel quite easy now in regard to you. It will make a vast difference. He will arrive in the city tomorrow morning, it being impossible for him to have his things ready before. You will secure him passage and make all necessary arrangements to have him in your section, as this is the desire of the editor. He will be a valuable member, as you want a mechanic along with you with his tools for building houses.
</p><p>
Everything looks natural in the Record office, with the exception of your absence. A universal regret prevails among your numerous friends in West Chester. Some are just learning of the journey and are surprised.
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of taking a walk last evening with Misses Apple and Bradshaw. Ellen is a little sad. It is a matter of surprise and admiration to observe the pure and innocent devotion she manifests towards you. I know not what her feelings may be after a while; but I am confident that her love towards you now is as pure as an angel's. I shall pay her every courtesy and render her every favor in my power.
</p><p>
My supper is ready and I must close. Be pleased to
accept the friendship and ardent wish for your health, happiness and prosperity of your old friend and fellow apprentice; and may these few lines keep me fresh in you memory. Good-bye. Endeavor to keep up your spirits. Everything depends on this.
</p><p>
I will send this letter, containing one from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a>, to you with Clinton.
</p><p>
Farewell,
</p><p>
