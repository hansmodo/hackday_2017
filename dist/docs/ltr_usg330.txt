DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
A letter from you and one from Mary were received some time ago, which
I commenced to answer in a letter addressed to Mary, but being
frequently interrupted by matters of business it was laid aside for
some days, and finally torn up. I now have all my time taxed. Although
occupying a position attracting but little attention at this time
there is probably no garrison more threatened to-day than this.
</p><p>
I expect to hold it and have never had any other feeling either here
or elsewhere but that of success. I would write you many particulars
but you are so imprudent that I dare not trust you with them; and
while on this subject let me say a word. I have not an enemy in the
world who has done me so much injury as you in your efforts in my
defence. I require no defenders and for my sake let me alone. I have
heard this from various sources and persons who have returned to this
Army and did not know that I had parents living near Cincinnati have
said that they found the best feeling existing towards me in every
place except there.
</p><p>
You are constantly denouncing other general officers and the inference
with people naturally is that you get your impressions from me. Do
nothing to correct what you have already done but for the future keep
quiet on this subject.
</p><p>
Mary wrote to me about an appointment for Mr. Nixon. I have nothing in
the world to do with any appointments, no power to make and nothing to
do with recommending except for my own staff. That is now already
full.
</p><p>
If I can do anything in the shape of lending any influence I may
possess in Mr. Nixon's behalf I will be most happy to do so on the
strength of what Mary says in commendation, and should be most happy
if it could so be that our lot would cast us near each other.
</p><p>
I do not know what Julia is going to do. I want her to go to Detroit
and board. She has many pleasant acquaintances there and she would
find good schools for the children.
</p><p>
I have no time for writing and scarcely any for looking over the
telegraphic columns of the newspapers.
</p><p>
My love to all at home.
</p>
ULYS.
