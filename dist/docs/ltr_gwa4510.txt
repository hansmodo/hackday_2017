My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
With peculiar satisfaction I do myself the honor to 
acknowledge the receipt of your several favors, and to 
assure you at the same time, that it is with the warmest pleasure I express my full approbation of the various movements and operations, which your military 
conduct has lately exhibited; while I confess to you 
that I am unable to conceive what more could have 
been done under your circumstances, than has been 
displayed by your little persevering and determined 
army. Lord Rawdon's reinforcement from England 
was a most untoward circumstance ; but even this, I 
hope, will soon be surmounted by your good fortune. 
</p><p>
You will be informed from the Marquis, of every 
circumstance that has taken place in Virginia. A detachment from the army of this brave and fortunate 
young nobleman will, I hope, soon arrive to your assistance in Carolina. 
</p><p>
By our movements in this quarter, and the main army taking a position near <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and making every 
preparation for a serious attempt upon that place, we 
have already produced a happy effect, that of a withdrawal of a considerable part of the troops under the 
command of Lord Cornwallis as a reinforcement to 
their garrison, which has been some time past closely 
confined to York Island. This withdrawal will probably disappoint their views of conquest in Virginia, and 
will exceedingly embarrass the prospects of the British 
ministry in the proposed treaty to be opened at Vienna. This is a very great object, even should any thing prevent our obtaining further success in our operations against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
The operating force of the enemy in the southern States being confined in all probability to South Carolina, will leave the other States in a condition to afford 
you such succours as, with the aid of the Marquis's detachment, will, I trust, enable you to fulfil your hopes and wishes in their utmost extent in your command. 
Should this event take place, you may be assured, that, added to the honor that will be thereby reflected on 
your own person, it will afford me the highest satisfaction. I sincerely wish we had the means of communicating more frequently with each other. Be assured. 
Sir, my concern for your honor and welfare interests me most particularly in every event which attends you. 
</p><p>
A reason, which cannot at this time be communicated, induces me to request that you will be pleased 
to give me the earliest and most minute information 
of every event, that takes place with you, and a circumstantial detail of the present situation of the State of 
South Carolina, its strength and operative force, with 
its resources for the support of an army, and the extent of those resources, with the places where they 
may be collected and secured ; also the strength, position, and circumstances attending the enemy's force. 
I have the honor to be, etc. 
</p>
