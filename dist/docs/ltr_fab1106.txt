CALLAO, May 31, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>
</p><p>
I embrace the opportunity of the mail from here to Panama to write you.
</p><p>
One hundred and twenty four days from N.Y.; seventy one from Rio and we dropped our anchor on Peruvian ground in the Bay of Callao. We intended to stop at Valparaiso but, getting a fair wind off that port and it being a bad harbor to get out of, we kept on, much to my gratification as it had given me an opportunity of visiting Lima, a place which I have heard a great deal of and had a greater desire to visit.
</p><p>
To go back to our voyage. Thus far we are ahead of most of the fleet that sailed with us. Although we have had a long passage around the Horn, I can't begin to give you any idea of the weather we had. When in lat. 40° south we took the first taste of it. We had a gale of wind from southwest and laid hove to six days, accompanied by terrible hail squalls. I thought I had felt the wind blow before but nothing like this. The wind would fairly take the water along with it. The brig, with not a rag of sail on, would careen over, lee gunnels under water. Hard up the helm got her before the wind and she would bound madly over the waves at the rate of ten miles an hour. This would last for about fifteen minutes and then settle into a hard gale again. When it did not blow a gale it was calm and then you can imagine the sea knocking us about. This is a fair sample of the weather all the way.
</p><p>
We were blown off to the east of the Falklands, passed between Tierra del Fuego and the coast, got by the Cape forty miles by observation. We sailed a week and then found ourselves sixty miles to the east of it, struck down
south to lat. 59° south, had the snow six inches deep on deck one night, and finally got to the west of it. We beat all the way against a gale of wind up the coast to lat. 40° south. We took the trades in 28° and ten days after, arrived here.
</p><p>
Day after day, week after week and month after month rolled on and we kept sailing. I really think that the greater part of this earth's surface is covered with water. You no doubt think such a voyage tedious, but you get used to it. The vessel becomes the whole world to you and walking the deck is equal to and answers the purpose of walking miles ashore.
</p><p>
We caught albatrosses ten feet from tip to tip, with a hook and line. Harpooned porpoises, saw immense schools of sperm whales and other things too numerous to mention. What yarns I can tell when I get home. For further accounts of these regions I refer you to Watts' hymns: 'I would not live always,' etc.
</p><p>
But here we are, once more safely moored in a safe harbor, and, sailor-like, Cape Horn and its hail storms are all forgotten. Let me add that the Brig G. E. has behaved herself nobly. We lost our stern boat but have not had a sea board us to do any damage and have not carried away a spar; outsailed everything we saw except one ship. She now looks better than she did when she left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>.
</p><p>
Callao harbor, formed by the island of San Lorenzo, is fine. The wind blows constantly one way and never a gale. The ocean is literally Pacific about here. There are forty vessels lying here (six ships of war) of all nations. We lie close by a large French Frigate and they have most excellent music every evening.
</p><p>
Callao is a mean, dirty hole, filled with sailor grog shops and low taverns. The castle is all that there is interesting in it. This is very large, covering ten or fifteen acres of
ground and mounted once one hundred and forty five guns. It is now used for the Custom House and Prison.
</p><p>
The houses are built one story mostly, of adobe and stucco or plastered and painted yellow. The population is about three thousand. We walked all over it in about fifteen minutes and were ready to go to Lima.
</p><p>
From the Bay you have a fine view of Lima. It is situated in the plain which runs back to the base of the Andes, about nine miles from Callao. This plain is almost level and rises gently back to the mountains and, until you get within a mile or two of the city, is almost barren. The Andes rise up close to the city and tower above the clouds, their tops covered with snow. I thought the mountains at Rio were some, but they are not to be compared with these. It is only at sunrise and sunset that you can see them distinctly, then they are sublime!
</p><p>
There are good stages like the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> stages running to Lima every two hours, fare $I. We arrived Sunday evening and went out Tuesday at ten A.M. In a thick cloud of dust we ran into a school of jackasses bound for Callao and ran one under. We made the run, however, inside of an hour. We began to see the manners and customs of the people. We met any quantity of market women riding on donkeys and smoking their cigars very comfortably. They ride remarkably well. Why shouldn't they?--seeing as how they ride astride like a man. There was an Indian woman in the coach, one of the passengers passed around some cigars. She took one and lit it up like the rest. There was a French Naval Officer on board, a young fellow full of fun. He spoke little English and broke out singing 'O Carry Me Back,' etc., which I was surprised at in this country. He was with the Prince de Joinville when he visited <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>. I saw him at Lima several times. He gave me his card
and a very pressing invitation to call on board his frigate Le Pursevant, lying at Callao.
</p><p>
Well, when you get within a mile of the city the road is laid out similar to the Mall in Boston and on each side orange gardens. This is a favorite promenade of the inhabitants and the gardens are also thrown open. You pass through a large arched gateway (for Lima is walled) and find yourself in the city all at once, as there are no houses outside the walls to be seen.
</p><p>
The coach dropped us near the Grand Plaza. We found the Golden Ball Hotel, ordered dinner and took rooms, and started out to see the lions. I stopped three days, came down today and saw all I could see in that time. All that you have heard and read about Lima, at least all that I have, is correct, and the half has not been told you.
</p><p>
I should think the city covered as much ground as N.Y. but the houses are only two and most of them one story high, on account of earthquakes. The inhabitants number from sixty to seventy thousand. The great Cathedral is an immense church and comes up to all my ideas of one of the rich Catholic churches. The great Altar is said to be of solid silver. This I can't swear to as it looked full as much like Brittania ware or pewter, as silver.
</p><p>
The ladies are the most beautiful women I have ever seen. They do wear the Saya manta or Tapada or a splendid canton crepe shawl (instead of your awkward bonnets) drawn over the face, so as to conceal all but one eye. They do have small feet and ankles and they do smoke cigarettes. Yes, thank Heaven I have at last gotten into a place where tobacco smoke is not offensive. Everybody smokes and smoke everywhere: at the dinner table and at the hotel, even. I have been revelling in a cloud of smoke ever since I have been here.
</p><p>
One of the most graceful feats I have ever seen performed by a lady is to see one of these Senoritas smoke. Their walk is also very graceful. You must make some allowances for my being so fascinated as you know I have not seen any females for about four months and being set down in Lima among the prettiest women of the world--you must excuse my admiration of them. Their cigars are very small and the tobacco is rolled up in corn husk or paper. I wish I could send you a bundle.
</p><p>
One of the greatest curiosities is the market. It is held in an open square of about two acres of ground. I visited it in the morning and such a motley crowd of people it would be hard to find anywhere else. They have all the kinds of fruit I ever heard of and a great many kinds that I never heard of. Not only all the tropical fruits but also apples, pears, peaches and all the fruits that you have in Maine.
</p><p>
About half of the common people, soldiers, etc., breakfast here and cooking of all kinds is carried on.
</p><p>
On my way back I went into the Cathedral to mass (for you have to be a Catholic here). When the procession of priests carry around the Host, which is about every day, preceded by a darkey ringing a bell, every one stops and kneels, no matter what they are doing. The officer gets off his horse and the billiard players lay down their cues. All respect religion alike. About this, it is best to 'quety el sombrero' (take off your hat) or you might get your head punched.
</p><p>
Now then to go on with my story. I went into the church. There were about half a dozen little boys chanting in front of the altar. I was very much shocked to see them making signs and smiling at me. When they got through they made a rush for me. One tried to drag me one way and one another. At last I followed one and he led me up in front of a picture and says 'Santa Rosa. Un
rial, Senor, un rial.' Which, being interpreted, means one shilling. Thinks I to myself: 'If it costs a shilling a head to be told the names of all the saints in this church it will break me.' I had work to shake them off and get out again.
</p><p>
There are a great many churches here. Some of them are very rich in gilding and pictures. They are open at all hours and a great many of them have convents attached to them. About every other man we meet is a fat friar in a long, white flannel gown.
</p><p>
It is built like all Spanish cities; every house is a square with an open court in the center and balconies over the streets. The stores around the Plaza are very handsome and the crowd as great as in Broadway. Everything is carried about on the backs of jackasses so the streets are very quiet. To make some noise they keep up an eternal ringing of bells.
</p><p>
The greatest novelty to me was to see the women ride astraddle. They are half Indian and white and are called Cholos. They wear Panama hats and a common dress, but always silk stockings and a rich shawl. It looked kind of queer to me to see them driving about twenty jackasses, loaded with fruit, and smoking. But you soon learn here not to be astonished at anything.
</p><p>
Visited a cotton factory, owned and carried on by a Yankee of course. 'It is as much as a girl can do,' he says, 'to tend one loom.' Visited an infant school. The door was wide open and I stepped in. One little fellow sang out: 'Senora, Americana pur la California.' The Senora invited me to walk in, one fellow brought me a French Grammar that he was studying. In fact, most everybody can speak some French. It is not so hard as I thought it would be to get along in a foreign city. I can make myself understood and the Spanish is easy to get hold of. I think it a beautiful language and mean to learn it, for
after I make a fortune in California I am coming down to Lima. I should like to stop here about a month for I have never seen any place that I was so loath to leave. I am actually homesick.
</p><p>
Well, I must close. I would write a large book but I couldn't send it to you. You may think it hot weather here but it is not so. The wind coming over the snowcovered mountains keeps it just right, from 58° to 80° temperature. Perhaps you have seen in the geography that it never rains in Peru? It's true. The people tell me it never does. The climate is beautiful. Umbrellas are out of date and an American woman with a bonnet looks actually out of place in the street. But this beautiful climate is just what makes them so indolent. They get up at eight o'clock, breakfast at ten, dine at half past two all the way to six. Supper, they never heard of.
</p><p>
We lived first-rate at the hotel for $2.00 per day. Found a man by the name of Haley, from Bangor. He is a printer and has been out here five years. He has his wife with him and invited me to his house. I called. They have adopted all the customs of the country and their children speak Spanish. He is going to California. So is everybody who can get there.
</p><p>
We take two passengers from here and could get as many more if we could carry them. The excitement increases as we near the place. They say nothing ever comes from there. That all the ships are piled up and the men all left. We shall probably sail tomorrow. It takes about fifty days to go from here.
</p><p>
You must prize this letter very much as it costs 62¢ to send it from here to Panama by the British Steamer. This is the last stage and at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> I expect to find letters from you. Til then, 'Adios, Senora.'
</p><p>
You will find a good description of Lima in the U.S. Expedition which used to be in the library at Bucksport.
</p><p>
We have it on board and we found his account correct. It is a valuable work and I advise you to read it.
