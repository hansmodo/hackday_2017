Gold not only concentrates but begets talent. This is fully illustrated in the history of San Francisco. Here you will find, concentrated, more men who excel in every art and science, than in any other city in the world containing the same population. This is true, whether you refer to genius and excellence, as exhibited in the pulpit, at the bar, on the bench, at the counter, or in the workshop. The public libraries are numerous, and some of them extensive. The Mercantile library contains over thirty thousand volumes. The public schools are conducted with great efficiency and sustained by a liberal taxation. The churches, of which there are some sixty or more, are also liberally sustained and generally well attended. The church in which the late Starr King preached, is among the most attractive for its size, finish and arrangements. The society built it in
accordance with his taste and plan. He was a very popular, eloquent and genial gentleman, as well as an ardent patriot and preacher. He wielded an unbounded influence not only in the city, but throughout the state. The church is his monument. He sleeps in its lawn and beneath its shadow.

The Jewish synagogue, on Sutter street, is a very large and imposing edifice, richly finished inside and out, and in point of wealth and grandeur might be taken for Solomon's temple. Its circular towers overlook the city, and like the shot tower, are among the first objects that attract the stranger's eye. The "old Mission Church," on Mission street, built of adobe by the Jesuits nearly one hundred years ago, is an interesting relic of olden time, and well worth a visit. The Catholics are supposed to be the most numerous religious sect in San Francisco, the Protestants next, and then the Jews. A large number of the merchants, it is said, are Jews; the balance French, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Scotch, English, Irish, Chinese and Americans. In the latter class are embraced nearly all the leading merchants of the city. They are the men of backbone and enterprise, who build the city and pay the burthen of its taxation.

The trade and commerce of San Francisco have become comparatively immense. In less than
twenty years the merchandise export trade has increased from one million and a half to twenty-two millions of dollars per annum. The gold exports average for the last twenty-one years nearly fifty millions per annum. Though the gold mines are less productive than formerly, the silver mines have largely increased their productions, and promise a still more liberal yield for the future.

The climate here is always temperate and delightful, not excepting the rainy season, which is made up, like our April, of sunshine and showers. The thermometer rarely varies more than seven degrees. But twice in the last twenty years have snow-flakes whitened the ground, or been known to fall in San Francisco. For at least three-fourths of the year you may here enjoy a continous sun-shine, without the interruption of a cloud. Woolen clothing is worn the year round by the citizens. The nights are always cool, and you sleep well. The markets are stocked throughout the year with the best of beef, mutton, wild game, fish and fowl, including every variety of fruits and garden vegetables. The gardens furnish strawberries, green corn, green peas, new potatoes, and other luxuries of this character in abundance, every month in the year. The fruits and vegetables are as excellent in quality as they are remarkable for size. Onions grow as large as tea-plates; beets sometimes weigh
from fifty to seventy-five pounds apiece; sweet potatoes five to six pounds; pears two pounds; apples one pound; peaches half a pound; a stem of grapes from five to twelve pounds. Breadstuffs are exceedingly cheap. Fuel is not much used except for cooking.

A man may live here for fifty cents a day, or at the rate of five dollars a day, and so far as food is concerned about equally well at either price. Wages are high; laborers who are skilful are scarce, while speculators are quite too numerous. And yet the city is full of idlers who live, nobody knows how. You see them at every corner in the business streets, standing in groups earnestly discussing or cursing their luck and prospects. The hotels overflow with strangers coming and going, all on the rush. On some of the streets, nearly every other door opens into a drinking saloon, gambling den, or something worse. The gamblers dress richly and overload themselves with ostentatious jewelry. There is no place so safe that thieves do not "break through and steal." And yet there is as much good society to be found in San Francisco as in any oter city of the same population. They are a social, genial, generous people, especially the better classes. They appreciate talent. A high order of talent commands any price it pleases to ask, in the pulpit, at the concert, or in the
lecture-hall. Their editors and magazinists are men of eminent abilities. The "Overland Monthly," for originality, freshness, and vigor of thought, excels its Eastern contemporaries.

The city has natural advantages which cannot be taken away from her. She has no rival, and need fear none. She sits majestic on her throne of hills, and bathes her feet in the sea. Telegraph-hill is her flag-staff. It looks in the distance like a church spire, and is built with dwellings to its apex. From its highest point floats the American flag, as a signal to ships at sea, seeking to enter the Golden Gate. The islands in the bay are small, but exceedingly picturesque, and look like emeralds bestudding the bosom of the ocean. The Government occupies several of them for military purposes. Nature opened the golden gate by cleaving asunder a mountain range, and left it open. Any ship can pass through it that pleases, except a public enemy. The adjoining fort, built as it were on one of the gate-posts--a bluff--commands the entrance. If an enemy should attempt to pass, one broadside from the guns of the fort would annihilate him.

Montgomery street is the Broadway of San Francisco. It is thronged from morning till night with a richly dressed people, many men, and some fair women. In other words, it is the fashionable
shop row of the city, elegantly built and stocked. Here you will find every thing heart can wish, and the thing you will most wish will be gold in your purse. They keep splendid goods, and ask extravagant prices. Rents throughout the city are excessive. In the business part of the city some stores pay a rent of fifteen hundred dollars a month. Houses that are merely ordinary, rent from two to three thousand dollars a year, and better class houses for five thousand. Taxes are still more excessive than rents. How people contrive to live here is to me a mystery. Yet everybody dresses well and appears to live well. There is seldom a professional beggar to be seen.

In the evening when the street lamps are lighted, if you climb flag-staff hill and take a survey of the brilliant scene, you will think you have caught a view of the great celestial city, all ablaze with glory, and undulating in billows of light over a vast range of hills and valleys, where the infinite armies of the blest, clad in glittering raiment, are marching on from height to height, until lost in the unbounded domain of the burning stars.

There are several public gardens within the city which are filled with all that is rich and rare in art and nature, especially Woodward's. In the suburbs, also, there are many pleasant places of public resort. The Cliff House is one of the most
popular, situated about ten miles from the city, on a rocky point of land extending into the ocean. Here we saw hundreds of seals sleeping on the rocks or frolicking or diving in the sea. Some of them are very large, weighing from three to five hundred pounds, and when gathered on the rocks sometimes quarrel and howl like a pack of hounds in full chase. They have heads much like dogs, short legs, and are usually of a brown color. The rocks look like old ruined castles, and stand out a little way from shore in the sea, yet in plain sight from the Cliff House. These rocks, at all times of day, are covered with seals which are regarded by visitors as objects of great curiosity and interest. Here you will see pleasure parties, the elite of the city, arriving and departing at all hours in the day. The house keeps every kind of refreshments the "inner man" can desire, and furnishes a band of musicians in addition. The gaities and festivities of this delightful resort excel in interest anything of the kind we have ever before seen. Here you can dance or sing, eat, drink and be merry; ogle the seals, or ogle the girls, as you please. Whatever else you may do, you are not allowed to disturb the seals. They are protected by law, and seem to enjoy themselves hugely, and to care for nobody.

In going to the Cliff House, we took the
turnpike, which is as fine a road as there is in the world, and returned by the ocean beach, along the water's edge, on the trackless sand, which was as hard as a pavement. On our right was the vast ocean, rolling landward its mountain billows, which broke on the sand beneath our carriage wheels; and on our left lay a sandy plain, covered with little sand-hills, of conical shape, which had been moulded by the ocean winds, and over which had grown a wild myrtle, giving them the appearance of hay-cocks in a farmer's meadow. As the billows broke on shore, the spray drifted over us, and refreshed the myrtle with a dewy baptism, as if flung from the godly fingers of old Neptune himself. The scene was one of great beauty and grandeur, connected as it was with a sunset, which threw a brilliant pathway on the ocean, glowing as if paved with fire, and which seemed to span the restless and untrodden deep, and lead upward from earth to Heaven, until lost in the mysteries of the infinite.
