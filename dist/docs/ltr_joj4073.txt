Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
I had last evening the pleasure of receiving your favour of the 27th ult. I congratulate you on your safe arrival, and sincerely wish that the same good fortune may attend your return. 
</p><p>
While our country remained part of the British empire, there was no impropriety in soliciting the of our distant 
brethren and fellow-subjects for any liberal and public purposes. It was natural that the younger branches of the political family should request and accept the assistance of 
the elder. But as the United States neither have, nor can have, such relations with any nations in the world ; as the 
rank they hold and ought to assert, implies ability to provide for ail the ordinary objects of their government ; and as the 
diffusion of knowledge among a republican people, is and ought to be one of the constant and most important of those 
objects, I cannot think it consistent with the dignity of a free and independent people, to solicit donations for that or any other purpose, from the subjects of any prince or state whatever. 
</p><p>
The public, with us, are, in my opinion, so deeply interested in the education of our citizens, that universities, &c, ought no longer to be regarded in the light of mere private 
corporations. The government should extend to them their constant care ; and the State treasuries afford them necessary supplies. 
</p><p>
The success which might attend such applications in this country, can only be matter of conjecture. The raising 
money by subscription has not been so customary in France as in Britain, and my opinion is, that you would collect 
very little. If indeed the court should set the example, 
and really wish to promote it, the thing would then become 
fashionable ; and I am inclined to think that even the fashion 
of giving would have a great run for a few weeks. As to 
books, the consideration that every American student, who 
in a long lapse of years might open those books, would read 
the name of the donor, added to the vanity of authors, and 
others who may be zealous to extend the reputation of 
French literature, would probably procure you some. As 
to apparatus, the best instruments and machines are made 
in England ; and the greater, as well as better part of those 
used here, are, I am told, brought from thence. I am much 
mistaken if Europe, in general, does not wish that we were 
less knowing than we are already. But if it was probable 
that such applications would be attended with ever so great 
success, yet as I think they can be properly made only in 
the United States, I could not prevail upon myself to advise 
the experiment. 
</p><p>
If, however, you should visit Paris, I assure you it will 
give me great pleasure to see you, and to be instrumental 
in rendering it agreeable to you. We have been fellow labourers in the same field, and if you come, we will rejoice 
together in celebrating " harvest home." 
</p><p>
With respect to the disagreeable voyage in which your 
son shared with us, 1 won't say jubes renovare dolorem, 
because I am habituated to reflect on events of that sort 
with tranquillity. It was one of those, however, which 
tried all who were concerned in it ; and I must do your 
son the justice to say, that none of us preserved more equanimity and good-humour throughout the whole than he did, 
and he had a full share of unpleasant circumstances, as 
well as some others of us. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
