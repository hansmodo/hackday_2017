I do not hesitate a moment to answer my dear 
General's question in the affirmative, by declaring 
that now or never is the time for every virtuous 
American to exert himself in the cause of liberty 
and his country ; and that it is become a duty cheer 
fully to sacrifice the sweets of domestic felicity, to 
attain the honest, and glorious end America has in 
view; and I can, with a good conscience, declare, 
that I have devoted myself to the service of my 
country, in the firmest resolution to sink or swim 
with it, unanxious how I quit the stage of life, provided that I leave to my posterity the happy reflection that their ancestor was an honest American.

Here, my dear Sir, you will ask, why then do you 
wish to retire from a public office ? Not because I 
am deterred by any difficulties I have experienced, 
or any that might hereafter present themselves ; for I 
have had repeated experience, in the course of life, 
that what the greater part of mankind deem impossibilities exist only in idea, and are surmountable by 
a steady perseverance ; but, because I think I should 
prejudice my country by continuing any longer in 
this command. The favorable opinion that you are 
pleased to entertain of me, obliges me to an explanation, which I shall give you in confidence. I have 
already informed you of the disagreeable situation I 
have been in during the campaign, but I would 
waive that, were it not that it has chiefly arisen 
from prejudice and jealousy; for I could point out 
particular persons of rank in the Army, who have 
frequently declared that the General commanding in 
this quarter ought to be of the Colony from whence 
the majority of the troops came. But it is not from 
opinions or principles of individuals that I have drawn 
the following conclusion, that troops from the Colony 
of Connecticut will not bear with a General from an 
other Colony. It is from the daily and common conversation of all ranks of people from that Colony, 
both in and out of the army; and I assure you, that 
I sincerely lament that a people of so much public 
virtue should be actuated by such an unbecoming 
jealousy, founded on such a narrow principle, a principle extremely unfriendly to our righteous cause, as 
it tends to alienate the affections of numbers in this 
Colony, in spite of the most favorable constructions 
that prudent men, and real Americans amongst us, 
attempt to put upon it. And, although I frankly 
avow that I feel a resentment, yet I shall continue to sacrifice it to a nobler object, the weal of that 
country in which I have drawn the breath of life, 
resolved ever to seek, with unwearied assiduity, for 
opportunities to fulfil my duty to it.

I shall to-morrow write to <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> to collect the evidence in support of the charge against Prescott, and entreat him to be very particular. As 
the prisoners taken on board the vessels in the St. Lawrence are not yet passed, it is probable that I may, by their means, be able to furnish your Excellency with some accounts of the usage Allen received.

Since the receipt of your Excellency s, of the 18th, Major Rogers is come to this town. I sent to him, and, amongst a variety of passes, he produced a late 
one from the Committee of New Hampshire, to pass unmolested to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, for which place he sets out to-day. I believe there is no truth in the intelligence sent by Mr. Wheelock ; for I find, upon inquiry, that Rogers arrived -at this place after St. John's was invested, and that he went from hence to New 
England. I shall, however, make further inquiries. I shall forward the account against Captain Morgan to <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a> by next post. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, by the inclosed, that the junction of <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a> has 
taken place ; but their force is so small, and the weather has been so severe, that I fear they have not been able to possess themselves of Quebec. Should 
an attempt have been made to storm it, and have proved fruitless, and accidents have happened to Montgomery and Arnold, I tremble lest Canada should be 
lost. If I could procure any men, I would send them to Canada immediately; but I know not where to get any. Even <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> and Fort George are 
by this time, I fear, left to the care of the Commissary of Provisions and Conductor of Artillery. The 
officers, to whom I had issued warrants to raise four 
companies, meet with no success.

The first of the cannon arrived here on Wednesday, and the whole is on its way, but detained by 
the weakness of the ice in Hudson's River, occasioned by the uncommon mildness of the weather for several days past. One frosty night, if not deferred too 
long, will, however, put every thing in order, and I hope you will soon have the pleasure of seeing all at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>. 
</p><p>
To-morrow thirteen of the Caghnawaga tribe, under the care of Major Wales, will set out for <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> on a visit. 
</p><p>
Your letter to General Howe gave me great pleasure, and his answer must convince mankind of your 
superiority. His affectation is trifling, and unbecoming a gentleman. His letter, I believe, will be eventually a censure on General Carleton. 
</p><p>
I shall immediately forward to your Excellency 
what clothing can be spared from here ; great part 
of it is not yet made up. 
</p><p>
Sunday, January 7/7?. Yesterday a frost came on, 
and this morning I had the satisfaction to see the 
first division of sleds, with cannon, cross the river. 
Should there be snow all the way to <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, they 
will probably arrive there about this day week.

A Mr. Gamble, who was made prisoner with Brigadier Prescott, and who was a Deputy-Quartermaster-General in Canada, has entreated me to intercede 
with your Excellency to get him exchanged. He urges that he must be ruined unless he can get back 
to Canada. Although I by no means wish to prejudice an individual, yet I do not think it prudent 
that he should go to Quebec, unless it is in our possession. When that happens, I can see no inconveniency in exchanging him, or permitting him to go, 
and shall esteem it as a favor if he can then procure your leave, and if you can get him exchanged, that he may riot lose his office. lie writes to General 
Lee on the subject. I have expressly informed him that I did not think he could be permitted to go to Quebec until after its reduction. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to accept the compliments of the season, and my best wishes. I have the honor to be, 
with unfeigned esteem, your Excellency's most obedient, and 
</p><p>
Most humble servant, 
</p><p>
