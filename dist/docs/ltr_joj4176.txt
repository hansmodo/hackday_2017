Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 4th inst. your letter of the 23d of last month was 
delivered to me. It gave us all pleasure to find from it 
that you and your family were then well. If all the productions of your farm are as fine as tiie sample of one 
kind of them, which you sent me, you have much reason to 
praise it. 
You have certainly had no inconsiderable share of difficulties, dangers, and troubles, and as you justly observe, Providence has carried you through them all, and has also 
given you consolations and enjoyments. Such is more or 
less the lot of all men. If, my good friend, there were no 
trials in this world, it would not be what it certainly is, a 
state of probation ; some are tried by adversity, some by 
prosperity, and many by both. If in our journey through 
life, we were to meet with nothing but what was pleasant, 
we should probably be too little mindful of home, and too 
little disposed to take a rough road to it, even though it 
should be the most direct one. We have neither of us 
much further to travel. If, on our arrival, we find it a 
paradise, our enjoyments will not be diminished by the 
recollection that we had suffered much on the way. 
</p><p>
I still flatter myself with the expectation of again seeing 
you here, especially as your health is good, and your business would be attended to during your absence. We should 
have new affairs as well as old affairs to talk over. Those 
among the new ones, which concern the welfare of yourself 
and family, will be particularly interesting to 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
John J a v.
