SHERMAN, September 23d, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>.

The time has been when a journey overland to California partook of the marvelous. But now the trip has lost its former import, and amounts to little more than a pleasure excursion. And yet it is really a marvel, that we can now traverse a vast continent in seven or eight days, instead of consuming seven or eight months, as was done by the early emigrants. In fact, the only difficulty to be overcome, now, is simply--to start. We started--myself and wife--in September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>; the year made memorable by the completion of the great trans-continental railway.

In what I may have to say, you will probably recognize but little that is new; for I am well aware that this is a reading age, and that almost everybody is more or less familiar with the leading characteristics of the Pacific Slope. Yet it is possible my impressions of the golden land may
serve to amuse you, if they should not instruct.
</p><p>
From the Southern Shore of Lake Erie to Council Bluffs, the general aspect of the country is somewhat monotonous, being for the most part a rich alluvial plain of vast extent, enlivened by cultivated fields and small farm-houses, and begemmed here and there with infant villages and pretentious young cities. The railroad bridge which spans the Mississippi and connects Rock Island with Davenport, is a splendid structure, about two miles long.
</p><p>
On arriving at Council Bluffs, formerly the limit of western civilization, we found ourselves ushered into a new region, seeming not only strange, but peculiar in its geological formation. The bluffs consist of a collection of conical sand-hills, barren in appearance, yet graceful in outline. They look like a platoon of grenadiers drawn up in military attitude to protect from invasion the rich valleys of the Missouri. We passed them unchallenged. The town derives its name from the fact that the explorers, Lewis and Clarke, in 1804, held a council here with the Indians. The place has now become a city, containing about twelve thousand inhabitants. Her citizens, it is said, regard Omaha, which is situated on the western bank of the river, as an intrusive rival, and often speak of her, ironically,
as "a twin sister" born too late in life to take precedence in the commercial circle of that country.
</p><p>
Yet Omaha is equally plucky, and entertains no fears of being eclipsed, though born as late as 1854. She has a population of nearly twenty thousand. When the railroad bridge across the Missouri is completed, she will keep her foot in the stirrup, and continue to advance with a still higher degree of self-assurance. The distance between the two cities is four miles. The river is about a mile wide, turbid and treacherous. We were transferred on a steam ferry boat, keeping our seats in the omnibus the meantime; and were deposited like so much freight, unceremoniously, at the grand depot of the Pacific road in Omaha. Here we found the train, consisting of eight passenger cars, ready and waiting with steam up to receive us. In "the twinkling of an eye" our party was thrust on board, bag and baggage, when the whistle gave the signal, and the impatient steam-horse snuffed the air with a spasmodic puff, and then took to his heels, headed for the Rocky Mountains. In leaving Omaha, we left the old "Far West" behind us, which, by the people on the Pacific coast, is now called the "Far East." In the progress of the age the Far West has been obliterated, and is now no where
to be found. The great Platte River Valley upon which we now entered, running with almost lightning speed, presents one of the most beautiful and lovely landscapes, at this season of the year, that I ever beheld,--a vast sweep of level plains, waving with tall grass and wild flowers, and dotted, for the first fifty miles, with corn fields, stubble fields, shorn meadows, and humble cabins. In point of soil it is a rich country, but deficient in its supplies of living water, as well as entirely destitute of timber.
</p><p>
While in the Platte Valley, we were suddenly overtaken by a terrific thunder storm, attended with a violent wind and rain. The storm occurred in the early part of the evening, and continued for an hour or more. It seemed as if the artillery of Heaven had been brought into conflict, firing by regiments in every direction. We could see the electric fluid roll like cannon balls down the sky and over the vast plains. The scene was as sublime as it was terrific, and awed every passenger into silence. But in the morning, after the storm had passed, all nature seemed regenerated, and looked as beautiful as a young bride at her marriage festival.

Though you may imagine that these plains must appear monotonous and unattractive, yet in proceeding westward you see many things that
constantly interest you, novel sights of a singular character, accompanied with more or less amusing incidents. As we flew steaming and puffing over this silent and uninhabited region, we frequently startled herds of antelope feeding near the wayside, who ran, bounding gracefully over the plain, until lost in the distance. In one instance we saw two bears walking leisurely amid the sage-brush, within two hundred rods of the train, and seeming to care for nothing but themselves. We also passed through many villages whose only denizens are prairie dogs, a very pretty little animal, resembling the fox squirrel, and about the same size. They play, frolic, and bark within a stone's throw of the passing cars. Their houses are built of sand cemented with clay, and located near each other with narrow intervening streets, and are entered through a circular doorway. They are conical in structure and resemble potato-hills. The flesh of these animals is delicate. At one of the stations our breakfast table was furnished with a dish of prairie dog in the form of a stew. We were often regaled with antelope steaks at other stations--a kind of meat which we very much preferred, and which most of the passengers regarded as perfectly delicious.
</p><p>
As we approached what is called the Rocky Mountain range, we kept a sharp lookout for the
mountains, with the expectation of catching a sublime view of their lofty grandeur. But in vain. We arrived at Sherman, the highest point in the route, an elevation of more than eight thousand feet above the level of the sea, before we became conscious of having reached even their base. The truth is, the Rocky Mountains, in the direction of the railway, are but a myth--nothing but an elevated plain on a vast scale, with here and there a low range of cobble-stones embedded in bluffs, which look like the bank of a dried up river whose opposite bank has been removed, or lost in the even surface of the adjoining plain. The grade over this elevated plain, both the ascent and descent, for the whole distance, is so easy that in passing you would scarcely perceive it. The country produces little else than sagebrush and a few dwarf pines.
</p><p>
The town of Sherman, at present, but a station, is located on the very apex of the Rocky Mountains, the backbone of a continent, five hundred and fifty miles west of Omaha. The atmosphere is so clear that you can see Pike's Peak looming up in the south, at a distance of one hundred and sixty-five miles. The town is indebted to General Sherman for its name, who is the tallest, and I might say, the bravest and most gallant general that held a commission in the
Union army, during the Rebellion. His famous "march to the sea" has immortalized his name, and added a brilliant page to the history of his country.
