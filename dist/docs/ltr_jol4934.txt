My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
This will be delivered to you by the <a href='/results.php?tla=kap' rel='colleague'>Count Pulaski</a>, whose prowess is not unknown to you. 
</p><p>
The dislike of some of his officers to him as a 
stranger, the advantages which they have taken of him 
as such, and their constant contrivances to thwart him 
on every occasion, made it impossible for him to 
command with that satisfaction to himself and benefit 
to the public, which would undoubtedly have resulted 
from their acting in concert with him. He has there 
fore resigned his command, and determines to solicit 
Congress to entrust him with a legionary corps com 
posed of 68 horse, and about 200 foot. With such a corps and proper officers under him, to be perpetually 
scouring the interval between the two armies, and 
embracing every opportunity for a stroke of partisan 
ship, he thinks he will render considerable service, 
and I am persuaded from his intelligence and enterprising spirit, that the event will do him honour. 
</p><p>
His military ardour is very great, and he is exceedingly uneasy, lest by any delay on the part of Congress 
he should be obliged to appear late in the field, which would be almost as painful to him as refusal in the first instance. 
</p><p>
He apprehends no difficulty in raising his number 
of cavalry ; to engage the quota of infantry will be 
almost impossible, unless Congress will make an 
exception in his favour to their resolution against the 
admission of prisoners and deserters into the service. 
This is warranted by the practice of other nations, 
and deserters, etc., enlisted in detached corps are not 
by any means so dangerous as if they were admitted in the line. 
</p><p>
The count will be allowed, I presume, the Continental bounty for men, and the rate established for 
equipping his cavalry. His eagerness to distinguish 
himself will not suffer him to confine himself to the 
latter if he finds it inadequate. 
</p><p>
He expects to retain his rank as brigadier. If his 
whole history were known, Congress would grant his 
request with thanks for his generous disinterestedness 
on the present occasion. 
I beg leave to introduce the Count to your acquaintance ; you may depend upon it that Congress will not 
have reason to repent of having employed him in the 
way which is proposed. 
</p><p>
His zeal for our cause and courage, proof against 
every danger will cover him with glory, and I hope 
promote the general interest. 
</p><p>
I am your most affectionate 
</p><p>
