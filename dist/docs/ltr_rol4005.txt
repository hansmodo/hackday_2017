Dear John, 
</p><p>
The quiet, which in my last I mentioned to have prevailed 
here, still continues with very few interruptions. Though 
the imprudence of the tories has, in some instances, given 
disgust to the warm whigs, particularly in a contest for the 
government of the church corporation, to the exclusion of 
those out of the lines, and in appointing Mr. Moore rector, 
in order to fill the church, a few days before we came in. 
The Legislature have interposed, and the government of the 
church is transferred to the whigs. 
</p><p>
Our parties are, first, the tories, who still hope for power, 
under the idea that the remembrance of the past should be 
lost, though they daily keep it up by their avowed attachment to Great Britain. Secondly, the violent whigs, who 
are for expelling all tories from the State, in hopes, by that 
means, to preserve the power in their own hands. The 
third are those who wish to suppress all violences, to soften 
the rigour of the laws against the royalists, and not to banish 
them from that social intercourse which may, by degrees, 
obliterate the remembrance of past misdeeds ; but who, at 
the same time, are not willing to shock the feelings of the 
virtuous citizens, that have at every expense and hazard 
fulfilled their duty, by at once destroying all distinction 
between them and the royalists, and giving the reins into 
the hands of the latter ; but who, at the same time, wish that 
this distinction should rather be found in the sentiments of the 
people, than marked out by the laws. You will judge to 
which of these parties the disqualifications contained in our 
election bill has given the representation, when I tell you that the members for this city and county are Lamb, Harper, Sears, Van Zandt, Mallone, Rutgers, Hughes, Stag, 
and Willet. I must, however, do all parties the justice to 
say, that they profess the highest respect for the laws, and 
that, if we except one or two persons, they have, as yet, by 
no act contradicted that profession. 
</p><p>
We are very angry here with Great Britain, on account 
of her West India restrictions (from which, by-the-bye, they 
suffer greatly), and are fulminating resolutions to prohibit 
all intercourse with her, which I think will probably be the 
case ere long. 
</p><p>
Thus have I given you a sketch of our politics, which 
will only be interesting to you if, as I sincerely hope, you 
mean to return soon to us. 
</p><p>
Politics has extended this letter to such an unreasonable 
length, that I dare not hazard a subject nearer my heart 
than either, but must, at this time, confine all its dictates to 
simple assurances of the firm and tender affection with 
which I am, and ever shall be, 
</p><p>
Dear John, your friend,
