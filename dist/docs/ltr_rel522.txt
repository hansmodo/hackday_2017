My Precious Annie:  I have taken the only quiet time I have been
able to find on this holy day to thank you for your letter of the 29th
ulto.  One of the miseries of war is that there is no Sabbath, and
the current of work and strife has no cessation.  How can we be pardoned
for all our offenses!  I am glad that you have joined your mamma again
and that some of you are together at last.  It would be a great
happiness to me were you all at some quiet place, remote from the
vicissitudes of war, where I could consider you safe.  You must have
had a pleasant time at 'Clydale.'  I hope indeed that 'Cedar Grove'
may be saved from the ruin and pillage that other places have received
at the hands of our enemies, who are pursuing the same course here as
the have practised elsewhere.  Unfortunately, too, the numerous deep
estuaries, all accessible to their ships, expose the multitude of
islands to their predatory excursions, and what they leave is finished
by the negroes whose masters have deserted their plantations, subject
to visitations of the enemy.  I am afraid Cousin Julia [Mrs. Richard
Stuart] will not be able to defend her home if attacked by the vandals,
for they have little respect for anybody, and if they catch the Doctor
[Doctor Richard Stuart] they will certainly send him to Fort Warren
or La Fayette.  I fear, too, the Yankees will bear off their pretty
daughters.  I am very glad you visited 'Chatham' [the home of the
Fitzhughs, where my grandmother Custis was born].  I was there many
years ago, when it was the residence of Judge Coulter, and some of
the avenues of poplar, so dear to your grandmama, still existed.  I
presume they have all gone now.  The letter that you and Agnes wrote
from 'Clydale' I replied to and sent to that place.  You know I never
have any news.  I am trying to get a force to make headway on our
defenses, but it comes in very slow.  The people do not seem to realise
that there is a war.
</p><p>
It is very warm here, if that is news, and as an evidence I inclose
some violets I plucked in the yard of a deserted house I occupy.  I
wish I could see you and give them in person....  Good-bye, my precious
child.  Give much love to everybody, and believe me,
</p><p>
                                 Your affectionate father,
</p>
