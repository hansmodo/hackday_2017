<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='11'>11th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. A freshman came quite eager to be instructed in all the wiles of society. He wanted to try his hand at a flirtation, and requested minute instructions, as 
he knew nothing whatever : he was so very fresh. " Dance with her, he was told, and talk with her ; walk with her 
and flatter her; dance until she is warm and tired; then propose to walk in a cool, shady piazza. It must be a some 
what dark piazza. Begin your promenade slowly; warm up to your work; draw her arm closer and closer; then, 
break her wing." 
</p><p>
"Heavens, what is that break her wing? " " Why, you do not know even that Put your arm round her waist 
and kiss her. After that, it is all plain sailing. She comes down when you call like the coon to Captain Scott: You 
need not fire, Captain/ etc." 
</p><p>
The aspirant for fame as a flirt followed these lucid directions literally, but when he seized the poor girl and 
kissed her, she uplifted her voice in terror, and screamed as if the house was on fire. So quick, sharp, and shrill 
were her yells for help that the bold flirt sprang over the banister, upon which grew a strong climbing rose. This he 
struggled through, and ran toward the college, taking a bee line. He was so mangled by the thorns that he had to go 
home and have them picked out by his family. The girl's brother challenged him. There was no mortal combat, how 
ever, for the gay young fellow who had led the freshman's ignorance astray stepped forward and put things straight. 
An explanation and an apology at every turn hushed it 
all up.

Now, we all laughed at this foolish story most heartily. But Mr. Venable remained grave and preoccupied, and was 
asked : Why are you so unmoved ? It is funny. " I like more probable fun; I have been in college 
and I have kissed many a girl, but never a one scrome yet."

Last Saturday was the bloodiest we have had in proportion to numbers. The enemy lost 1,500. The handful left at home are rushing to arms at last. Bragg has gone to join <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> at Columbus, Miss. Old Abe truly 
took the field in that Scotch cap of his.

Mrs. McCord, the eldest daughter of Langdon Cheves, got up a company for her son, raising it at her own expense. She has the brains and energy of a man. To-day she repeated a remark of a low-country gentleman, who is 
dissatisfied: " This Government (Confederate) protects neither person nor property. Fancy the scornful turn of 
her lip ! Some one asked for Langdon Cheves, her brother. " Oh, Langdon ! " she replied coolly, " he is a pure patriot; 
he has no ambition. While I was there, he was letting confederate soldiers ditch through his garden and ruin him at 
their leisure."

Cotton is five cents a pound and labor of no value at all ; it commands no price whatever. People gladly hire out 
their negroes to have them fed and clothed, which latter can not be done. Cotton osnaburg at 37% cents a yard, 
leaves no chance to clothe them. Langdon was for martial law and making the bloodsuckers disgorge their ill-gotten 
gains. We, poor fools, who are patriotically ruining our selves will see our children in the gutter while treacherous 
dogs of millionaires go rolling by in their coaches coaches that were acquired by taking advantage of our necessities.

This terrible battle of the ships Monitor, Merrimac, etc. All hands on board the Cumberland went down. She 
fought gallantly and fired a round as she sank. The Congress ran up a white flag. She fired on our boats as they 
went up to take off her wounded. She was burned. The worst of it is that all this will arouse them to more furious 
exertions to destroy us. They hated us so before, but how now?

In Columbia I do not know a half-dozen men who would not gaily step into Jeff Davis's shoes with a firm conviction 
that they would do better in every respect than he does. The monstrous conceit, the fatuous ignorance of these critics! It is pleasant to hear Mrs. McCord on this subject, when they begin to shake their heads and tell us what Jeff 
Davis ought to do.
