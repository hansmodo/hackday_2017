Sir, 
</p><p>
The time for which I engaged to act in the Quarter-master's department, at the request of the Committee of Congress for Cooperation, is almost expired; and as I cannot exercise the office any longer, 
consistent with my own safety, I am to request 
your Excellency will take measures for relieving 
me, as soon as possible, from the disagreeable predicament I am in. In the mean time I shall be 
exceedingly obliged to your Excellency for the sense 
you entertain of my conduct and services since I 
have been in the department, as you alone are the 
best judge of the propriety of one and the merit of 
the other. The business is truly disagreeable and 
distressing, and has been so for a long time ; not withstanding, if it had been possible for me to have 
got through it this campaign, consistently with my 
own safety and the public good, upon the plan which 
Congress proposed, I would readily have done it. But, 
from the knowledge I have of the department, I 
know it is utterly impossible to follow the system, 
and answer the demands of the service; and to attempt it, at this critical season, will most assuredly 
defeat our plan of operations, and bring the army 
into the greatest distress. 
</p><p>
It would be a folly for me to attempt to combat 
the prejudices of public bodies, with hopes of success. 
Time alone can convince them that their measures 
are destructive of their true interest, as well as highly 
injurious to some of their most faithful servants. 
</p><p>
I am sensible my conduct has been viewed by 
many in a very improper light; and I am persuaded 
many think the business can be done with more 
method, and at a less expense, than it has been. I 
wish it may be the case ; but am much mistaken if 
the nature of the business is capable of more system, 
or will admit of less expense, if the plan of the war 
continues on its present scale, and the army on its 
present footing. 
</p><p>
I have endeavoured, to the utmost of my power, to 
enter into the spirit and intention of your Excellency's measures; and if my conduct has not been 
satisfactory to Government and to yourself, it has 
been owing to a want of abilities, and not inclination. 
I am, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
