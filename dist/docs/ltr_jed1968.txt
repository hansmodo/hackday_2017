Sir, 
</p><p>
Your dispatch of 22 d August and its enclosures sufficiently exhibit the inadequacy of the force under your command to perform the duties 
which have been devolved upon you in the present unhappy condition ot Kansas by the orders and instructions heretofore communicated. 
To meet this exigency the President has directed the Governor of the Territory to complete the enrolment and organization of the militia, as you 
will find fully set forth in the enclosed copy of a letter addressed to him by the Secretary of State ; and the President has directed me to say to you 
that you are authorized, from time to time, to make requisitions upon the Governor for such 
militia force as you may require to enable you promptly and successfully to execute your orders 
and suppress insurrection against the government of the Territory of Kansas, and, under the circumstances heretofore set forth in your instructions, to give the requisite aid to the officers of 
the civil government who may be obstructed in the due execution of the law. Should you not be able to derive from the militia of Kansas the 
adequate force for these purposes, such additional number of militia as may be necessary, will be drawn from the States of Illinois and Kentucky, 
as shown in the requisition, copy of which is 
</p><p>
The views contained in your instructions to the officers commanding the troops, under date of August 19 : are fully approved, and accord so 
entirely with the purposes of the Executive as to leave but little to add in relation to the course which it is desired you should pursue. The position of the insurgents, as shown by your letter 
and its enclosures, is that of open rebellion against the laws and constitutional authorities, with such manifestation of a purpose to spread devastation 
over the land as no longer justifies further hesitation or indulgence. To you, as to every soldier, whose habitual feeling is to protect the citizens of 
his own country, and only to use his arms against a public enemy, it cannot be otherwise than deeply painful to be brought into conflict with any portion of his fellow countrymen. But, patriotism 
and humanity alike require that rebellion should be promptly crushed, and the perpetration of the crimes which now disturb the peace and security 
of the good people of the Territory of Kansas, should be effectually checked. You will, therefore, energetically employ all the means within 
your reach to restore the supremacy of law, always endeavoring to carry out your present purpose to prevent the unnecessary effusion of blood. 
</p><p>
In making your requisitions for militia force, you will be governed by the existing organization of the Army and the laws made and provided in such cases. When companies, regiments, brigades, or divisions, are presented to be 
mustered into the Service of the United States, you will cause them before they are received to be minutely inspected by an officer of your command, appointed for the purpose. 
</p><p>
Very respectfully 
</p><p>
Your Obt Servt,
