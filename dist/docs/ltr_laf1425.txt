I write you a line, my dearest love, by some French officers, my friends, who embarked with me, but, not having received any appointment
in the American army, are returning to France. I must begin by telling you that I am perfectly well, because I must end by telling you that we
fought seriously last night, and that we were not the strongest on the field of battle. Our Americans, after having stood their ground for
some time, ended at length by being routed: whilst endeavouring to rally them, the English honoured me with a musket ball, which slightly
wounded me in the leg,--but it is a trifle, my dearest love; the ball touched neither bone nor nerve, and I have escaped with the obligation
of lying on my back for some time, which puts me much out of humour. I hope that you will feel no anxiety; this event ought, on the contrary,
rather to reassure you, since I am incapacitated from appearing on the field for some time: I have resolved to take great care of myself; be
convinced of this, my love. This affair, will, I fear, be attended with bad consequences for America. We will endeavour, if possible, to repair
the evil. You must have received many letters from me, unless the English be equally
ill-disposed towards my epistles as towards my legs. I have not yet received one letter, and I am most impatient to hear from you. Adieu; I
am forbidden to write longer. For several days I have not had time to
sleep. Our retreat, and my journey hither, took up the whole of last night; I am perfectly well taken care of in this place. Tell all my
friends that I am in good health. My tender respects to Madame d'Ayen. A thousand compliments to the viscountess and my sisters. The officers
will soon set out. They will see you; what pleasure! Good night, my dearest life!

I love you better than ever.
