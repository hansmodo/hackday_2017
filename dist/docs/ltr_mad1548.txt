DEAR SIR, I drop you a few lines rather as a fulfilment of 
my promise than for the purpose of information, since they go 
by Mr. Jones, who is much better acquainted with the politics 
here than myself. 
</p><p>
I find, with pleasure, that the navigation of the Mississippi 
will be defended by the Legislature with as much zeal as could 
be wished. Indeed, the only danger is, that too much resentment may be indulged by many against the federal Councils. 
Paper money has not yet been tried even in any indirect mode 
that could bring forth the mind of the Legislature. Appearances on the subject, however, are rather flattering. Mr. Henry* 
has declined a reappointment to the office he holds, and Mr. 
Randolph is in nomination for his successor, and will pretty 
certainly be elected. R. H. Lee has been talked of, but is not 
yet proposed. The appointments to Congress are a subject of 
conversation, and will be made as soon as a Senate is made. 
</p><p>
Mr. Jones will be included in the new Delegation. Your presence and communications on the point of the Mississippi are 
exceedingly wished for, and would, in several respects, be extremely useful. If Mr. Jones does not return in a day or two, 
come without him, I beseech you. I am consulted frequently 
on matters concerning which I cannot or ought not to speak, 
and refer to you as the proper source of information, as far as 
you may be at liberty. Hasten your trip, I again beseech you. 
I hope Mrs. Monroe continues well. My sincerest respects 
wait on her. 
</p><p>
In haste, adieu. Yrs.
