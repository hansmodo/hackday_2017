MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE long continuance of the session, and the uncommon heat and drought of the weather, have made this 
to me an unpleasant spring, and to increase my mortification, I have this week received no letter from 
you. I have not, for several months before, failed to 
receive a delicious letter, worth a dozen of mine, 
once a week. 
</p><p>
Well ! <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> comes on. Mr. M. is now to be its 
leader. How changed in reputation since <a href='/results.php?year=1788'>1788</a> ! I 
wonder not at the choice of Well-born Winthrop. 
He might, I suppose, have been chosen at any time. 
His father was one of my best friends, and the son 
was a good son of liberty. I know of nothing to his 
disadvantage. The federalists committed an egregious blunder in a very unwarrantable and indecent 
attempt, had almost said, upon the freedom of elections, at their previous meeting for the choice of governor. The opposite party, to be sure, practise arts 
nearly as unwarrantable in secret, and by sending 
agents with printed votes. But this is no justification, 
unless upon Cato's principle : In corrupta civitate corruptio est licita ; i. e., in a corrupt city, corruption 
is lawful. Elections are going the usual way in our 
devoted country. O ! that I had done with them. 
We shall realize the raving in the Tempest, which C. 
quoted to me in his last letter : 
</p><p>
" I the Commonwealth" we shall "by contraries 
Execute all things ; for no kind of traffic 
Shall we admit ; no name of magistrate ; 
Letters will not be known ; wealth, poverty 
And use of service, none ; contract, succession, 
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none ; 
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil ; 
No occupation ; all men idle, all; 
And women too ; but innocent and pure ; 
No sovereignty : 
</p><p>
All things in common nature should produce 
Without sweat or endeavor ; treason, felony, 
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, 
Would I not have ; but nature should bring forth 
Of its own kind, all foizon, all abundance, 
To feed my innocent people." 
</p><p>
This is lubberland, indeed, Le pays de Cocagne, 
I believe the French call it ; but it is terra incognita. 
I am afraid we shall have too many of its qualities 
without its innocence. 
</p><p>
I have no hope of Congress rising, before the last 
of May. Never in my life did I long to see you 
more. 
</p><p>
I am, most ardently, your
