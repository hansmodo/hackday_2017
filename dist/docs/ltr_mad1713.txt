DEAR SIR, I am just favored with yours of the 28th ult. I 
wish I could remove your anxiety for the French. The last 
accounts are so imperfect and contradictory that it is difficult 
to make anything of them. They come, also, through the Brussels and English channels, which increases the uncertainty. It 
appears, on the whole, that the combination against the revolution, and particularly against their new Republic, is extremely 
formidable, and that there is still greater danger within from 
the follies and barbarities which prevail in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. On the other 
hand, it seems tolerably clear that the nation is united against 
Royalty, and well disposed to second the Government in the 
means of defence. At this distance it is impossible to appreciate particular measures, or foresee the turn which things may 
finally take. 
</p><p>
The newspaper tax noticed by the President has been referred to a Committee, but no report has yet been made. It is 
of great importance that some change should take place that 
will remove the obstruction which has been thrown in the way 
of information to the people. In all Governments the public 
censorship is necessary, in order to prevent abuses. In such an 
one as ours, where the members are so far removed from the eye 
of their constituents, an easy and prompt circulation of public 
proceedings is peculiarly essential. 
</p><p>
The election of a Vice President has excited in this quarter 
considerable animation, and called forth comparative portraits 
of the political characters of Mr. Adams and Governor Clinton, 
the only candidates brought into the field. The former has 
been exhibited in all its monarchical features, and the latter in 
the anti-federal colors it wore in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1788">1788</a>. There are not sufficient 
data here to calculate with certainty the event of the contest. 
The probability is rather favorable to Mr. Adams, but not in 
such a degree as to prevent pretty keen apprehensions among 
his friends. As the opposition to him is levelled entirely 
against his political principles, and is made under very great 
disadvantages, the extent of it, whether successful or not, -will 
satisfy him that the people at large are not yet ripe for his system.

We are informed by the last advices from Europe that the 
harvest has generally been scanty, and that in England, particularly, it has suffered prodigiously from the wetness of the season. From this cause, and the general state of things abroad, 
a great demand on our stock is anticipated. Wheat is already 
up at 9s., and flour at 45s., of this currency. The rise must soon 
communicate itself to Virginia, and it is to be hoped the farmers 
will not lose the benefit of it by premature sales. We all regret the detention of Col. Taylor. I hope the cause of it has 
ceased, and that we shall soon have his arrival in proof of it. 
It is probable that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> will not remain very long in 
his public station, but it is certain that his retirement is not to 
be ascribed to the newspaper calumnies which may have had 
that in view.

I remain, dear sir, yours, &c.
