Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
The war has really commenced. You will have full 
details of the fall of Sumter. We are on the eve of a 
terrible war. Every man will have to choose his position. You fortunately have the military education, 
prominence, and character, that will enable you to play 
a high part in the tragedy. You can't avoid taking such 
a part. Neutrality and indifference are impossible. If 
the government is to be maintained, it must be by military power, and that immediately. You can choose your 
own place. Some of your best friends here want you in 
the War Department; Taylor, Shires, and a number of 
others talk to me so. If you want that place, with a 
sure prospect of promotion, you can have it, but you are 
not compelled to take it; but it seems to me you will 
be compelled to take some position, and that speedily. 
Can't you come to Ohio and at once raise a regiment ? 
It will immediately be in service. The administration 
intend to stand or fall by the Union, the entire Union, 
and the enforcement of the laws. I look for preliminary 
defeats, for the rebels have arms, organization, unity; 
but this advantage will not last long. The government 
will maintain itself or our Northern people are the veriest poltroons that ever disgraced humanity. 
</p><p>
For me, I am for a war that will either establish or 
overthrow the government and will purify the atmosphere of political life. We need such a war, and we 
have it now, 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
