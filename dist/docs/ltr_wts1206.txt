Dear Brother : I have been here eight days, and have 
seen everything that interests travellers, and was to have 
started to-day for Odessa and the Crimea by the regular 
Russian steamer Vladimir; but last night when dining 
with the English Charge the Sultan's Grand Master of 
Ceremonies called, and expressed the Sultan's wish that I 
would postpone my departure, as he expressed his desire 
to see me, and was so situated that he could not until 
to-morrow. Of course I was compelled to defer iny 
departure and now I am undecided. . . . Soon after our 
arrival the Sultan received us with marked favor, and 
afterwards entertained us at breakfast ; but he gave to 
Fred Grant, as Prince Royal, the post of honor. We 
infer that the reason he has asked me to postpone my 
departure is to show me personally that he meant nothing wrong, which of course I knew he did not, for it was 
a subject of joke. The Russian Ambassador and English 
have entertained us, and they knew perfectly our relative ranks. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours truly,
