Last Friday was a great day here, celebrating the victories in Mexico. Grand display of flags on the shipping and public buildings. I have sent Sewall the Herald which contains a full account of the proceedings.

The military looked finely and I had the pleasure of seeing the salute paid to the Mayor and General Gaines. I should think the old man is seventy by his looks.

In the evening the scene in Broadway and the Park was truly magnificent. It fairly turned night into day. A great many of the private dwellings on Broadway had their parlor shutters thrown open, giving one a view inside splendidly lighted up. The fire works on the Astor House and the City Hall were very fine. Two bands were stationed, one on the balcony of the City Hall and one on Tammany Hall. They discoursed such music during the evening as would have done you good to hear. If you could have been here and walked through the Park and up Broadway with me it would have given you some idea of the people there are in this immense bee hive of human beings. From the Bowling Green to Canal Street, a distance of two miles, it was one solid jam of people. All was fun and frolic, no fights or rows that I saw but I saw a great many people with some strange disorder in their heads that would cause them to shout and sing and now and then the sidewalk would fly up and hit them in the head, a disorder very prevalent in this city.
