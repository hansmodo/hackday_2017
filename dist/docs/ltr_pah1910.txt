HON. SIR : As by the act of Government it is directed that the Governor with the advice of the privy Council shall exercise the executive Powers 
of Government, a Doubt arises whether the Governor alone may issue a warrant upon the Treasury for the Payment of any money on accounts certified 
by the Commissioners. From experience it is found impracticable to attend to many matters of consequence to the safety of the State, if the Council are, 
not only to advise the issuing of Warrants upon such Certificates, but also to keep Records of the same. We think it proper to acquaint the General 
Assembly with these our Sentiments; and we beg leave earnestly to recommend it to their consideration, whether it would not be to the advantage of 
the State if the Commissioners were empowered finally to transact this Business, or some other regular mode adopted for the future settling & passing 
the accounts against this State. 
</p><p>
By advice of Council

To the HON. EDMUND PENDLETON,
