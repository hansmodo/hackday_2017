My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
The scoundrels who fled their ranks and left about half 
their number to do their work have succeeded in establishing their story of surprise, stuck with bayonets and 
swords in their tents and all that stuff. 
</p><p>
Tliey were surprised, astonished and disgusted at the 
utter want of respect for life on the part of the confederates, whom they have been taught to regard as inferior 
to them, and were surprised to see them approach with 
banners fluttering, bayonets glistening and lines dressed 
on the centre. It was a beautiful and dreadful sight and 
I was prepared for and have freely overlooked the fact 
that many wilted and fled, but gradually recovering, 
rejoined our ranks. 'But those who did not recover, 
their astonishment has to cast about for a legitimate 
excuse ; and the cheapest one was to accuse their officers, 
and strange to say, this story is believed before ours who 
fought two whole days. . . .J 
</p><p>
In this instance the scamps will soon learn their mistake. Those who ran and cried "surprise," "cut up," 
&c., expected all who stood to their work to be killed, but 
all were not killed and enough remained as witnesses, 
after the public are satisfied with the horrid stories of 
men butchered, &c. . . . 
</p><p>
For two days they hung about the river bank filling the 
ears of newspaper reporters with their tales of horrid 
surprise. Regiments all cut up, they the only survivors 
and to our utter amazement we find it settling down as 
history. . . . 
</p><p>
Every battery (three) was harnessed up in position 
before called on to fire and cavalry (only 250 in my whole 
division) was in the saddle at daylight, and the attack 
did not begin until the sun was two hours high. . . . 
</p><p>
Prentiss was not surprised, for I sent him word an hour 
before the enemies' infantry began to appear, and he was 
not made prisoner until after 3 P.M. . . . 
</p><p>
I confess I did not think Beauregard would abandon 
his railroads to attack us on our base (when he knew that 
by waiting a short time we should be forced to advance) 
where he would most assuredly have been beaten. 
</p><p>
I am on the extreme right and we are in contact with 
the enemies' pickets. Some fierce struggle must soon follow, but that the war is ended or even fairly begun I do not believe. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother, 
</p><p>
