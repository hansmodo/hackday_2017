MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
It is now the 5th of September, and I have been 
at this place more than a fortnight ; but I have had 
so many matters to arrange, and so much to attend 
to, since I left <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, that I have scarcely touched a 
pen. I am now vastly behindhand in many things 
which I could have wished to have written down and 
transmitted to my American friends, some of which 
would have amused, and others diverted them. But 
such a rapid succession of events, or rather occurrences, have been crowded into the last two months 
of my life, that I can scarcely recollect them, much 
less recount them in detail. There are so many of 
my friends, who have demands upon me, and who 
I fear will think me nea-ligent, that I know not which 
to address first. Abby has had less of care upon her, 
and therefore has been very attentive to her pen, and 
I hope will supply my deficiencies. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=auteuil' rel='city'>Auteuil</a> is a village four miles distant from Paris, and 
one from Passy. The house we have taken is large, 
commodious, and agreeably situated, near the Woods 
of Boulogne, which belong to the King, and which 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> calls his park, for he walks an hour or 
two every day in them. The house is much larger 
than we have need of; upon occasion, forty beds 
may be made in it. I fancy it must be very cold in 
winter. There are few houses with the privilege 
which this enjoys, that of having the saloon, as it is 
called, the apartment where we receive company, 
upon the first floor. This room is very elegant, and 
about a third larger than General Warren's hall. 
The dining-room is upon the right hand, and the 
saloon upon the left, of the entry, which has large 
glass doors opposite to each other, one opening into 
the court, as they call it, the other into a large and 
beautiful garden. Out of the dining-room you pass 
through an entry into the kitchen, which is rather 
small for so large a house. In this entry are stairs 
which you ascend, at the top of which is a long gallery fronting the street, with six windows, and, opposite to each window, you open into the chambers 
which all look into the garden. 
</p><p>
But with an expense of thirty thousand livres in 
looking glasses, there is no table in the house better 
than an oak board, nor a carpet belonging to the 
house. The floors I abhor, made of red tiles in the 
shape of Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>'s floor-cloth tiles. These 
floors will by no means bear water, so that the 
method of cleaning them is to have them waxed, 
and then a man-servant with foot brushes drives 
round your room, dancing here and there like a 
Merry Andrew. This is calculated to take from 
your foot every atom of dirt, and leave the room in 
a few moments as he found it. The house must be 
exceedingly cold in winter. The dining-rooms, of 
which you make no other use, are laid with small 
stones, like the red tiles for shape and size. The servants' apartments are generally upon the first floor, 
and the stairs which you commonly have to ascend 
to get into the family apartments are so dirty, that I 
have been obliged to hold up my clothes, as though 
I was passing through a cow-yard. 
</p><p>
I have been but little abroad. It is customary in 
this country for strangers to make the first visit. As 
I cannot speak the language, I think I should make 
rather an awkward figure. I have dined abroad 
several times with <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s particular friends, 
the Abbes, who are very polite and civil, three sensible and worthy men. The Abbe de Mably has 
lately published a book, which he has dedicated to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>. This gentleman is nearly eighty years 
old ; the Abbe Chalut, seventy-five ; and Arnoux, 
about fifty, a fine, sprightly man, who takes great 
pleasure in obliging his friends. Their apartments were really nice. I have dined once at 
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='met acquaintance'>Dr. Franklin</a>'s, and once at Mr. Barclay's, our consul, who has a very agreeable woman for his wife, 
and where I feel like being with a friend. Mrs. Barclay has assisted me in my purchases, gone with me 
to different shops, &c. To-morrow I am to dine at 
Monsieur Grand's ; but I have really felt so happy 
within doors, and am so pleasingly situated, that I 
have had little inclination to change the scene. I 
have not been to one public amusement as yet, not 
even the opera, though we have one very near us. 
</p><p>
You may easily suppose I have been fully employed, beginning house-keeping anew, and arranging 
my family to our no small expense and trouble ; for 
I have had bed-linen and table-linen to purchase and 
make, spoons and forks to get made of silver, three 
dozen of each, besides tea furniture, china for the 
table, servants to procure, &c. The expense of 
living abroad, I always supposed to be high, but my 
ideas were nowise adequate to the thing. I could 
have furnished myself in the town of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, with 
every thing I have, twenty or thirty per cent, cheaper than I have been able to do it here. Every thing 
which will bear the name of elegant, is imported 
from England, and, if you will have it, you must pay 
for it, duties and all. I cannot get a dozen handsome wine-glasses under three guineas, nor a pair of 
small decanters for less than a guinea and a half. 
The only gauze fit to wear is English, at a crown a 
yard ; so that really a guinea goes no further than a 
copper with us. For this house, garden, stables, &c, 
we eive two hundred guineas a year. Wood is two 
guineas and a half per cord ; coal, six livres the basket of about two bushels ; this article of firing, we 
calculate at one hundred guineas a year. The difference between coming upon this negotiation to 
France and remaining at the Hague, where the house 
was already furnished at the expense of a thousand 
pounds sterling, will increase the expense here to six 
or seven hundred guineas ; at a time, too, when Congress have cut off live hundred guineas from what 
they have heretofore given. For our coachman and 
horses alone, (<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> purchased a coach in 
England,) we give fifteen guineas a month. It is 
the policy of this country to oblige you to a certain 
number of servants, and one will not touch what belongs to the business of another, though he or she 
has time enough to perform the whole. In the first 
place, there is a coachman who does not an individual thing but attend to the carriages and horses ; 
then the gardener, who has business enough ; then 
comes the cook ; then the maitre d' hotel ; his business 
is to purchase articles in the family, and oversee, 
that nobody cheats but himself ; a valet de chambre, 
</p><p>
John serves in this capacity ; afemme de chconbre, 
</p><p>
Esther serves in this line, and is worth a dozen 
others ; a coiffeuse, for this place, I have a French 
girl about nineteen, whom I have been upon the point 
of turning away, because Madame will not brush a 
chamber ; " it is not de fashion, it is not her business." 
I would not have kept her a day longer, but found, 
upon inquiry, that I could not better myself, and hairdressing here is very expensive, unless you keep such 
a madam in the house. She sews tolerably well, so 
I make her as useful as 1 can. She is more particularly devoted to Mademoiselle. Esther diverted 
me yesterday evening, by telling me that she heard 
her go muttering by her chamber door after she had 
been assisting Abby in dressing. " Ah, mon Dieu, 
'tis provoking," (she talks a little English.) 
" Why, what is the matter, Pauline, what is provoking ? " " Why, Mademoiselle look so pretty, I, 
so mauvais." There is another indispensable servant, 
who is called a frotteur ; his business is to rub the 
floors. 
</p><p>
We have a servant who acts as maitrc cVhoiel, 
whom I like at present, and who is so very gracious 
as to act as footman too, to save the expense of 
another servant, upon condition that we give him a 
gentleman's suit of clothes in lieu of a livery * 
Thus, with seven servants and hiring a charwoman 
upon occasion of company, we may possibly make 
out to keep house ; with less, we should be hooted at 
as ridiculous, and could not entertain any company. 
To tell this in our own country, would be considered 
as extravagance ; but would they send a person here 
in a public character to be a public jest ? At lodgings in Paris last year, during <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s negotiations for a peace, it was as expensive to him as it is 
now at house-keeping, without half the accommodations. 
</p><p>
Washing is another expensive article ; the servants 
are all allowed theirs, besides their wages ; our own 
costs us a guinea a week. I have become steward 
and book-keeper, determined to know with accuracy 
what our expenses are, and to prevail with <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> to return to America, if he finds himself 
straitened, as I think he must be. <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='met acquaintance'>Mr. Jay</a> went 
home because he could not support his family here 
with the whole salary ; what then can be done, curtailed as it now is, with the additional expense ? <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> is determined to keep as little company as he 
possibly can, but some entertainments we must make, 
and it is no unusual thing for them to amount to 
fifty or sixty guineas at a time. More is to be per* 
formed by way of negotiation, many times, at one 
of these entertainments, than at twenty serious conversations ; but the policy of our country has been, 
and still is, to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. 
We stand in sufficient need of economy, and, in the 
curtailment of other salaries, I suppose they thought 
it absolutely necessary to cut off their foreign ministers. But, my own interest apart, the system is 
bad : for that nation which degrades their own ministers bv obliging them to live in narrow circumstances, cannot expect to be held in high estimation 
themselves. We spend no evenings abroad, make 
no suppers, attend very few public entertainments, or 
spectacles, as they are called, and avoid every expense that is not held indispensable. Yet I cannot 
but think it hard, that a gentleman who has devoted 
so great a part of his life to the service of the 
public, who has been the means, in a great measure, of procuring such extensive territories to his 
country, who saved their fisheries, and who is still 
laboring to procure them further advantages, should 
find it necessary so cautiously to calculate his 
pence, for fear of overrunning them. I will add 
one more expense. There is now a Court mourning, and every foreign minister, with his family, 
must go into mourning for a Prince of eight years 
old, whose father is an ally to the King of France. 
This mourning is ordered by the Court, and is to be 
worn eleven days only. Poor <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> had to 
hie away for a tailor to get a whole black silk suit 
made up in two days ; and at the end of eleven days, 
should another death happen, he will be obliged to 
have a new suit of mourning, of cloth, because that 
is the season when silk must be left off. We may 
groan and scold, but these are expenses which cannot be avoided ; for fashion is the deity every one 
worships in this country, and, from the highest to the 
lowest, you must submit. Even poor John and 
Esther had no comfort amongst the servants, being 
constantly the subjects of their ridicule, until we were 
obliged to direct them to have their hair dressed. 
Esther had several crying fits upon the occasion, 
that she should be forced to be so much of a fool ; 
but there was no way to keep them from being 
trampled upon but this ; and, now that they are a la 
mode de PaiHs, they are much respected. To be 
out of fashion is more criminal than to be seen in a 
state of nature, to which the Parisians are not averse. 
</p><p>
Sunday here bears the nearest resemblance to 
our Commencement, and Election days ; every thing 
is jollity, and mirth, and recreation. But, to quit 
these subjects, pray tell me how you all do. I 
long to hear from you. House and garden, with 
all its decorations, are not so dear to me as my own 
little cottage, connected with the society I used there 
to enjoy ; for, out of my own family, I have no attachments in Europe, nor do I think I ever shall 
have. As to the language, I speak it a little, bad 
grammar and all ; but I have so many French servants, that I am under a necessity of trying. 
</p><p>
Could you, my sister, and my dear cousins, come 
and see me as you used to do, walk in the garden, 
and delight j^ourselves in the alcoves and arbours, 
I should enjoy myself much better. When <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> is absent, I sit in my little writing-room, or 
the chamber I have described to Betsey, and read 
or sew. Abby is for ever at her pen, writing or 
learning French ; sometimes company, and sometimes abroad, we are fully employed. 
</p><p>
Who do you think dined with us the other day ? 
A Mr. Mather and his lady, son of Dr. Mather, and 
Mrs. Hay, who have come to spend the winter in 
France. I regret that they are going to some of 
the provinces. To-day, Mr. Tracy, Mr. Williams, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, and Colonel Humphreys are to dine 
with us ; and one day last week we had a company 
of twenty-seven persons ; <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='met acquaintance'>Dr. Franklin</a>, Mr. Hartley 
and his secretaries, &c. &c. But my paper warns 
me to close. Do not let anybody complain of me. 
I am going on writing to one after another as fast 
as possible, and, if this vessel does not carry the 
letters, the next will. Give my love to one of the 
best men in the world. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
A. A.
