Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received by yesterday's post your letter of the twenty-second. In reply to which I beg leave to refer you to 
mine of the eighteenth, and to add farther here, that any 
application to the government would imply doubts, which do 
not exist in my mind, and for which there is no foundation. 
On the contrary I have every reason to be convinced, tl at all 
stipulations in the treaty between France and the United 
States of America will be scrupulously complied with. It is 
true, that the first decree for fitting out privateers was hastily 
passed, and needs correction ; but all such correction as may 
be needful will be made. 
In the mean time, I think it a matter of no consequence what 
may be the rate of insurance against capture at Lloyd s. 
Real Americans certainly will not pay a premium where they 
run no risk, and as to those who borrow our flag under false pretences, it is no matter what they pay. I hope the Americans will have so much good sense, as to see that the proof of 
payment of a premium to insure against capture ought to operate, as an evidence against them in the courts of this country. 
If I were to sit as judge, I would certainly consider it as a 
strong presumption, that the property, however covered, was 
not American, and probably should on that presumption condemn it as prize, leaving the party to his appeal, in order to 
take off before the higher court by good evidence the weight of such presumption. I have the honor to be, &c.
