MY DEAR MR. CRAMER:
</p><p>
Before leaving England I had accepted invitations to visit cities and
country houses in Scotland--and places in England not yet visited by
me--to take up all the month of September and part of October. I
thought there was time for me to visit this interesting country and to
make a run through Denmark, Sweden and Norway and get back to Scotland
in time to keep my engagements. But I have found so much of interest
here, and the modes of conveyance so slow in reaching the points of
greatest interest, that it is already too late to go even to Denmark,
leaving out Norway and Sweden. Already we have spent eight actual days
in carriages in getting from point to point, exclusive of other modes
of travel. We have visited most of the lakes and crossed the principal
passes in Switzerland and Northern Italy. It has all been exceedingly
interesting to me, the greatest regret being that I had not more time.
</p><p>
I intend yet to visit Denmark, and the countries north of it, but
whether this fall or next season is not yet determined. Probably about
next June. I am sorry not to be able to see Mary before she returns to
America. I do not expect to return there before next July a year, and
possibly not so early.
</p><p>
All send love to Mary and the children with kindest regards for yourself.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
