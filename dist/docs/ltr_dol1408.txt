DEAREST NIECE, I have been so much engaged in the book you kindly sent by 
the last post, that I have scarcely left my self time to thank you for it by this. I 
will, however, take an early opportunity to show my gratitude by a longer letter.

If you can send me the " Romance of History " I will be very glad, and will make 
proper dispatch in the perusal of it. Governor Barbour is here and will stay some 
time. Philippa does not expect to see <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> again for some time, and regrets it much. Her father is now a judge 
and she a recluse. I find you have no idea yet of the improvement love can make, or 
you would not surmise that another must have had to do the courting for John. After he became acquainted with S. Carter, 
his tongue twanged as if sent from a bow ! Last winter when I witnessed his attentions 
to her, and heard him talk and laugh like Ganymede, I knew it was Cupid s act, by 
the color. She is a sweet girl and I hope you will see her before long, you and my dear Mary. 
</p><p>
Ever your affectionate aunt,
