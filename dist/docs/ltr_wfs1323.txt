HEAD QUARTERS, ARMY OF THE U. S. OF AMERICA, COYOACAN, August 21, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>
</p><p>
SIR: Too much blood has already been shed in this unnatural war between the two great republics of this continent. It is time that the differences between them should be amicably and honourably settled. Your excellency knows that there is with this army a commissioner on the part of the United States invested with plenary powers to that end. In order to open the way for the
 two republics to enter into negotiations, I desire to execute, on reasonable terms, a short armistice.
</p><p>
I await with impatience, until to-morrow morning for an answer to this communication; but in the meantime I will take and occupy such positions without the capital as I may consider necessary to the shelter and convenience of this army.
</p><p>
I have the honor to remain, with high consideration and respect, Your excellency's most obedient servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="me">WINFIELD Scott</a>
</p><p>
To his Excellency the President and general-in-chief of the republic of Mexico.
</p>
