FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
DEPARTMENT OF STATE, June n, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1796">1796</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR: 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you, that the President with the 
advice and consent of the Senate of the United States, has appointed you their Minister Plenipotentiary to Portugal ; Col. Humphreys having at the same time been appointed Minister 
Plenipotentiary to Spain. But the negotiations with the Barbary Powers, which were committed to Colo. Humphreys, unfortunately continue incomplete : there is indeed not a little danger 
that the peace concluded with Algiers may, by some untoward 
events, be defeated. This circumstance, together with the fact 
that no minister is yet appointed to succeed you in Holland, where 
for several reasons, it seemed important we should have one, deter 
mined the President to postpone the transfer of your services from 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> to Lisbon. You will therefore continue to exercise your functions as Minister Resident at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, until a change of 
circumstances shall render it expedient for you to proceed to 
Lisbon. This expected change may probably admit of your removal early in the autumn, of which however you will be duly 
advised. In the mean time you will consider the new appointment, what it is in reality, a decided proof of the President's high opinion of your talents, integrity and worth. 
</p><p>
I am very respectfully, etc. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tip" rel="me">TIMOTHY PICKERING</a>.
