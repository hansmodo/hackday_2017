SIR: 
</p><p>
I understand there has been some regulation of prices lately attempted 
at the port of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. Such a measure is highly impolitic, and 
must inevitably ruin the commerce that is attempted to be established 
there, in its very infancy. It is, therefore, my particular orders, that you 
give no countenance to any such measures; but, on the contrary, use 
your best endeavors to suppress it, and give every encouragement to a 
free uninterrupted trade. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant
</p><p>
