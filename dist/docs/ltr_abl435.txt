TO SECRETARY SEWARD.

WASHINGTON, March, 7,<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.

Mr. M. is now with me on the question of the Honolulu Commissioner. It pains me some that this tilt for the place of Colonel Baker's
friend grows so fierce, now that the Colonel is no longer alive to defend him. I presume, however, we shall have no rest from it. In
self-defense I am disposed to say, "Make a selection and send it to me."
