Dear Brother : Your note of the 14th is received. I am 
glad you are going to Europe, and under such favorable 
auspices. 
</p><p>
You are sure of a hearty reception there, and you will 
be greatly entertained and instructed by wonders that 
must be seen as well as read of. ... It is generally 
conceded that I shall be elected, though it is not sure. 
No doubt a majority of Republicans favor me, but combinations are often made, and may be in this election. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
