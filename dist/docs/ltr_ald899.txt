IF CALIFORNIA at this moment has little real claim to notoriety among the countries of the globe, it may be entitled the land of incidents, for you can scarcely make a journey of twenty miles without meeting some adventure worthy a paragraph. It was during a walk of ten miles in the mountains, through a drizzling rain in November, that I became acquainted with our mutual friend, G-- My wagon and goods lay mudbound on the brow of the first mountain above the Valley, and I had built a bower (not of roses) by the
roadside, waiting the course of the storms, hoping there might be a cessation of strife between the sun and rain long enough to enable me to get up to my location at Dawlytown. It was during a casual visit to my headquarters that I saw Mr. G- -, and on my return he was my companion and guest for the night. It is by his request that I write you, though the subject is an "oft-told tale" and nothing new can well be added. I speak of California--of California as I found it. Not the land of Ophir, where Solomon got his gold, nor of the dwelling-place of the Genius of Aladdin, but simply of one hundred and thirty miles of the famed Valley of the Sacramento and of the neighboring mountains which I have traveled over. I am one of that class of nomad Anglo-Saxons who, in their modest desire of obtaining sudden wealth by picking the golden lumps from the piles which the mountain groaned under here (once), crossed the plains last summer, and in order to get to the gold region before all others, took the cut-off to Feather River, about sixty-five miles above the sink of Mary's River For this happy hit, I had the pleasure of going four hundred miles further than by the old road; of living three weeks on hard bread and coffee, and nothing else; of fighting Indians nearly all the way; and finally of reaching the confines of El Dorado four weeks later than those who kept the "even tenor of their way" on the old route. All that I had read of the Valley of the Sacramento, previous to leaving the States, was highly in favor of its beauty, the fertility of its soil, the salubrity of its climate, and the clearness of its atmosphere, all of which led me to expect a kind of natural Eden, and by passing many weeks on barren sand plains, nearly destitute of vegetation, or crossing rocky and barren mountains, I was in a good condition to appreciate any change for the better. The view from the mountain, as far as I could see, was pleasant, but I thought at the moment that it would not compare with the rich views of many of our western prairies; and I think so still. The following is a short extract from my journal on the day I reached the Valley, which is to the point on the first and third counts:
