SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed I send your Excellency a copy of my 
last letter to Congress, to which they have given no 
answer, and which necessarily involves very important consequences. 
</p><p>
The affairs of the Quarter-master's department are 
so intimately connected with the operations of the 
army, and the security, support, and movements of 
the latter so dependent on the former, that I think 
it my duty to give your Excellency the earliest in 
formation of every change and embarrassment in it, 
which may affect the service. This measure is necessary, not only for the public welfare, but for my own 
justification. 
</p><p>
Although I esteem it a peculiar misfortune to be 
reduced to the necessity of taking steps tending to 
my own justification, yet when I have not that sup 
port which was promised me by the Committee of 
Congress, when I engaged in the duties of the office, 
and which was and still is necessary to the order 
and management of the business, I have nothing left 
but to point out the causes of the failure. And I 
trust, when my conduct comes to be fully understood, 
and the business of the department stripped of vulgar prejudices and private enmity, it will be found to 
have been both prudently and honestly conducted. I 
shall not enter into a justification of all the detail of 
the business. I know it is too extensive for the wisdom of an angel to guard against every imposition. 
I am not chargeable for such evils, where the mis 
fortune originates in the plan of the war and the 
state of the finances. Though I cannot pretend to 
be responsible for the fidelity, discretion and prudence 
of every agent employed in the lesser branches of 
business, yet I presume the much greater part of 
every order are men of integrity, and some of them 
are the first characters for business upon the Continent. One thing I will venture to affirm with confidence, which is, that every exertion has been made by all the agents to promote the service in general, 
and to fulfil your Excellency's orders in particular, 
as far as the means in their hands or their personal 
credit or influence could be extended for the purpose. 
</p><p>
The crisis is now fast approaching, when there will 
be a general stagnation of business, as some of the 
deputies have already left the department, and others 
preparing to follow their example. Some have advertised to stop all purchases on the public account, for 
want of money to fulfil the contracts ; others will be 
reduced by necessity to do the like. Transportation 
cannot be kept up for want of money to pay those 
employed in that service ; and even those teams, 
which serve with the brigades, begin to refuse further service, unless they are paid for the past. 
</p><p>
Thus we seem to be threatened with distress and 
ruin on every side. I shall continue to give every 
aid to the business in my power, but it must sink 
under its own weight, unless it is better supported 
than it has been for months past. I am, with great 
respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
