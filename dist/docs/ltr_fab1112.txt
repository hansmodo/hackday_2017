</p><p>
Let me, in the first place, acknowledge the receipt of my letters from you and from home. Now let me give you some advice. Direct your letters to me personally at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento City</a> as the mail is brought up from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> twice a week. Never send by private hand--not if your own husband was the person. We have had enough experience in that line here. The person always dies on the way, goes to the mines or to the devil. Capt.
</p><p>
Cole or myself will remain here all the time, so you write by mail and direct to this place for the present.
</p><p>
I read your letters with great interest and consider myself posted up on events from down East, to the latest dates. I feel for poor Tim Smith, but was not at all surprised at what you wrote. It's clear he is a goner and I shall write to him by this steamer to start immediately for Cal.--where he can go to ruin in less than half the time he can in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>, or reform and take his place in the first society, no matter what his character was in the states.
</p><p>
During the rainy season business has been very dull. As all the roads to the mines are impassable all the transportation has been by water.
</p><p>
I have learned a great deal about the country--one thing in particular--that the valley of the Sacramento was originally and is now during the greater part of the rainy season, a part of the Pacific Ocean. You have probably heard ere this of the flood at this place--almost equal to the one in which Noah figured. It only shows that the people of the States know no more about this country than they do about the interior of Japan. I have ceased to wonder and am open to conviction. We were told by some of the old residents that the site of this city was liable to be overflowed, but as the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento</a> was then fifteen feet below the top of the bank and the country dry, we laughed at the idea every one. But we have had to acknowledge the corn.
</p><p>
About the 10th of January we had warm weather that melted the snow on the mountains, followed by a heavy south east rain storm. The water in the river was nearly to the top of the bank at the time. At 12 o'clock (noon) it boiled over the bank of the American Fork and came down on the city. The bank of the Sacramento is higher than the country back. That night the Sacramento
flowed over also and about dark the water was up to the floor of our store.
</p><p>
We piled the dry barrels upon the wet ones and on the counter and took part of our stock up stairs. At 9 o'clock the water was over the counter.
</p><p>
Boats were taking people out of one story buildings. A large adobe bakery close to us fell in with a tremendous crash. The water kept rising and things began to look serious. We had no boat and began to calculate how long it would be before we should float. Mrs. Lindley began to be alarmed and we took a strong brandy sling all around and sat down.
</p><p>
About 12 o'clock it stopped rising. The next morning there were three feet ten inches in our store and five feet in the street in front. We got into a whale boat and went down to the shipping. There were about 25 vessels lying at the bank. They were crowded with sick people and women and children.
</p><p>
The scene in the city was curious. It was a second Venice. A great quantity of merchandise floated off and was either stolen or lost. We lost over $500 worth of rice, besides dried fruits and other things damaged, though most of our goods we had taken upstairs.
</p><p>
We lived just as comfortably as before. Rigged a side ladder out of the chamber window, built a flat boat and paddled over the country extensively. Instead of the people wearing long faces as you would suppose, the city never was more lively. The streets were filled with boats and everybody was for having a frolic.
</p><p>
Captain Cole and myself took a whaleboat and took our lady and five young ladies from the Brig Toronto and took them out to the Fort to call on the McClellan girls who reside there. The fort is on high land and was dry, but from thereto the shipping was all plain sailing.
</p><p>
The prairie where I used to ride last summer as far as
you see, was covered with water. All the cattle on the plains were drowned. It was a hard sight to see them swimming about or lying dead in heaps on some little hill. There must be an immense quantity of them lost.
</p><p>
I staid in the city a week and took a small stock of goods and a canvas house, some lumber and provisions and started on the steamer Linda for the Yerba.
</p><p>
The towns of Vernon and Fremont at the mouth of Feather River were in the same situation as the city but it did not last so long at this point. Where I passed up from the Sierra Nevada to the coast range, was one vast lake. This is the beautiful and fertile valley of the Sacramento about which so much has been said and written.
</p><p>
As you ascend Feather River, the banks grow higher and twenty miles from the mouth at Captain Sutter's town, it is really a fine country. Captain Sutter has here a fine house and out buildings, and a large farm under cultivation. He resides here having sold his Fort at Sac. City.
</p><p>
Forty five miles from the mouth of Feather River the Yuba comes in. Here is a new city started on the site of an old Indian Rancheria, called Yuba City. I went on shore and liked the situation very much. There are about twenty stores and houses built and more going up.
</p><p>
Shakespeare says 'What's in a name?', but I concluded partly on account of the name to go on up the Yuba to the head of steamboat navigation to Covilland's new city, which he has called after his young wife, 'Marysville.' I found it going ahead of its rival, Yuba City, and a better place for trade and nearer to the mines on both rivers. Here I put up my store, bought a lot of land for $250 and went to trading. There is no overflow here and it is beautifully situated on the banks of the Yuba. It was formerly Nye's Ranch and was purchased by Covilland and Foster for $52,000. They have laid out a city one
mile square and here is where you will see the go-aheaditiveness of the Yankee nation. In one fortnight's time they sold $25,000 worth of lots at $250 each. In ten days, while I was there, 17 houses and stores were put up and what was before this a ranch, viz: a collection of Indian huts and a corral for cattle, became a right smart little city.
</p><p>
Marysville (I like the name) is 80 miles above <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento</a> City and eight miles from the mountains. It is colder here, the mountains being covered with snow but it never froze while I was there.
</p><p>
Two steamboats run regularly to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento City</a>. Freight is eight cents per lb and passage $20; meals $1.50, and sleep on deck or wherever you can get a chance.
</p><p>
Although the name is feminine and would imply a quiet sort of a place yet I regret to say that it contains the hardest set of 'hombres' it has been my fortune to live among in this country. Every night gambling, drinking, fighting and shooting are carried on to a great extent.
</p><p>
I saw two fellows who had come down from the mines with some dust spend, in one evening, all their money and then get into a row. One got knocked into a ditch and had his leg broken. the other had his head broken. They rather thought that they got their money's worth.
</p><p>
There was a gang of men on the ranch who had been killing cattle and sending the beef down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento City</a> by the boat load. They told Covilland that all the cattle running at large belonged to the public and they should shoot all they pleased, and if he (as he threatened to do) tried to take them he must send one hundred men, armed with rifles, and Yankees not Indians. Judge Wilson of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento</a> City being in the place appointed a Sheriff and made out the necessary documents to take them. Covilland then offered to furnish with a horse and
arms any man who would volunteer to go out with him and the Sheriff to take them.
</p><p>
You know my love of adventure too well to think I let this chance slip. I buckled on my armor and vaulted into the saddle. He soon raised fifteen able-bodied men, all armed with rifles and revolvers, and we set out.
</p><p>
We rode over the ranch all day in search of them. This farm contains 15,000 acres, lying between the Feather and Yuba Rivers and has 1000 head of horses, and mules and cattle without number. They are all branded with a hot iron, every ranch having its private mark. We saw some splendid droves of horses, never broken, so perfectly wild. It's a beautiful country to ride in--open prairie and the banks of the streams timbered with oak and cotton wood. Covilland offered me a farm of 640 acres and I could pick it where I chose, for $1,000. I think I shall take him up.
</p><p>
We rode 20 miles from home and on the banks of a small stream we came upon a collection of tents and found one of the gang 'Armstrong.' The Sheriff told him he was our prisoner but he said he would not go except by force, and started for his tent. On looking around and seeing several rifles pointed at him he concluded to cave in and come along. In his wagon was found a quarter of beef with Covilland's brand on it.
</p><p>
We rode to another ranch about three miles and got there at dark. Here Covilland put the whole party through, at his expense. We had a fine supper--were some hungry, I reckon. It was a fine moonlight evening and with our prisoner on a led horse we rode home in triumph. It was romantic and I could imagine myself back in the times of Scott's novels.
</p><p>
We got home about nine o'clock, after riding 40 miles. I shall never tire of riding on horseback. There is a charm in it for me and these California horses are so
different from ours. They either walk or run and the motion is like that of a cradle. How many of our horses do you suppose would stand it to run ten miles and keep their wind, as ours did that day?
</p><p>
The next day a Grand Jury was formed to indite them according to law and your humble servant had the honour of being one of the twelve wise men summoned to deliberate on this momentous question: whether law and order or anarchy and confusion shall exist in this country.
</p><p>
We assembled at the Foster House and were fastened into a room by the Sheriff. We lit our cigars and sat down to hear the charge of the Judge, examined the witnesses, summed up the evidence and found a True Bill against six...bound over the prisoner to appear and went to dine.
</p><p>
At the Foster House where I boarded were quite a number of ladies: Mrs. Towers, whose husband is landlord, Mrs. Foster, Mrs. Covilland and Mrs. Haight. Mrs. C. and Mrs. F. are two of the party who came over the mountains in 1846 and came so near starving. You recollect the horrid sufferings they endured, even to eating each other. They are the elite of the place, of course. Mrs. Covilland is quite young and pretty but there is not the least refinement or taste about them. The fact is that there is no woman who can come to this country at present and have any refinement. Their finer feelings, if they have any, will soon get blunted with the life they must live here.
</p><p>
Christmas evening a subscription ball was given at the City Hotel (at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento</a> City). There were about 40 ladies to 100 men and such ladies! Or rather, such Hoosiers, as some of them were! What do you think of a lady taking a child 4 weeks old to a ball and having her husband hold it while she takes a trot with some of the
hosts? There had to be a room appropriated for the mothers to nurse their children in.
</p><p>
This does not apply, however, to all the ladies present. Doctor White's daughters and the three McClellans were dressed in good taste and are pretty girls anywhere.
</p><p>
You seem very anxious about my getting married. Well, I will put your mind at rest on this subject. I intend to stay here until I make some money and stay single, and then I am going down to Lima and marry one of those beautiful dark-eyed senoritas and bring her to Bucksport! What do you think of my plan? And how would you like one for a sister? I think there are some advantages in it. They are easily wooed and won and love with all their hearts when they do love. So now you know all the information I know or can give you on this subject.
</p><p>
Well, I have given you a dose this time. I can't write anything on one sheet of paper and as I have nothing to do today (did my washing all up yesterday) I concluded I would write until I ran out.
</p><p>
I got back from Marysville last Saturday and found the city dry once more. The rainy season is about over and the weather is pleasant. We are going to build a new store here right off. Sold my goods and store at M. but retained the lot of land. It has doubled in value since I bought it. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento</a> City is after all the city. Property has not fallen in value one cent since the flood. No buildings were carried away and an immense quantity are going up this Spring. The prospect for trade is good. Merchandise of all kinds is low now.
</p><p>
I see there is a large emigration on the way from Maine. I expected it. Any man who will stay in that country and work a farm, when the same labor will give him here an ounce a day must be foolish. Or, if he wants a farm, here is land enough and I believe would produce. At any rate
they are making farms all around here.These men are called squatters and deny the claim of Captain Sutter and vote themselves a farm. Lindley and his wife are going up on Feather River to settle a farm.
</p><p>
We had a rarity for dinner yesterday. I should like to send you a piece--a steak off a grizzly bear. It was the finest meal I have ever eaten, so tender and juicy. The bear was killed 60 miles above, on the river and was as large as a cow. They are not as hard to kill as you and I had read. This fellow was killed with three shots. The meat sold readily for 75¢ per lb
</p><p>
I have been perfectly healthy this winter--weigh 175 lbs, can sleep on the ground wrapped in a blanket and live on the tail of a mackerel and one hard bread a day and grow fat. But I haven't lived as hard as that long at a time.
