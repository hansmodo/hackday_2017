We heard loud explosions of gunpowder in the direction of Camden. Destroyers were at it there. Met William 
Walker, whom Mr. Preston left in charge of a car-load of his valuables. General Preston was hardly out of sight be

nothing left, moaned William the faithful. We have nine armed couriers with us. Can they protect us ?
