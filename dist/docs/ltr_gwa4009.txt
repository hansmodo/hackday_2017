My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 23d of June, from London, and duplicate, have both been received ; and your safe arrival, after 
so short a passage, gave sincere pleasure as well on private 
as on public account, to all your friends in this country, and 
to none in a greater degree, I can venture to assure you, 
than it did to myself. 
</p><p>
As you will receive letters from the secretary of state's 
office, giving an official account of public occurrences as 
they have arisen and progressed, it is unnecessary for me 
to retouch any of them; and yet I cannot restrain myself 
from making some observations on the most recent of them, 
the communication of which was received this morning 
only. I mean the protest of the governor of Upper Canada 
(delivered by Lieut. Sheaffe), against our occupying lands 
far from any of the posts, which, long ago, they ought to 
have surrendered, and far within the known, and until now, 
the acknowledged limits of the United States. 
</p><p>
On this irregular and high-handed proceeding of Mr. Simcoe, which is no longer masked, I would rather hear 
what the ministry of Great Britain will say, than pronounce 
my own sentiments thereon. But can that government, or 
will it attempt, after this official act of one of their governors, 
to hold out ideas of friendly intentions towards the United 
States, and suffer such conduct to pass with impunity? 
</p><p>
This may be considered as the most open and daring act 
of the British agents in America, though it is not the most 
hostile or cruel ; for there does not remain a doubt, in the 
mind of any well-informed person in this country (not shut 
against conviction), that all the difficulties we encounter 
with the Indians, their hostilities, the murders of helpless 
women and innocent children along our frontiers, result 
from the conduct of the agents of Great Britain in this 
country. In vain is it, then, for its administration, in Britain, 
to disavow having given orders which will warrant such 
conduct, while their agents go unpunished, while we have 
a thousand corroborating circumstances, and indeed almost 
as many evidences (some of which cannot be brought forward), to prove that they are seducing from our alliances 
(endeavouring to remove them over the line) tribes that 
have hitherto been kept in peace and friendship with us, at 
a heavy expense, and who have no cause of complaint, except 
pretended ones of their own creating ; while they keep in a 
state of irritation the tribes who are hostile to us, and instigating those who know little of us, or we of them, to unite 
in the war against us ; and while it is an undeniable fact that 
they are furnishing the whole with arms, ammunition, 
clothing, and even provisions to carry on the war, I might 
go further and, if they arc not much belied, add men also, 
in disguise. 
</p><p>
Can it be expected, I ask, so long as these things are 
known in the United States, or at least firmly believed, 
and suffered with impunity by Great Britain, that there ever 
will, or can be any cordiality between the two countries? 
I answer no : and I will undertake, without the gift of prophecy, to predict, that it will be impossible to keep this 
country in a state of amity with Great Britain long, if the 
posts are not surrendered. A knowledge of these being 
my sentiments would have little weight, I am persuaded, 
with the British administration, nor, perhaps, with the nation, 
in effecting the measure ; but both may rest satisfied that, 
if they want to be in peace with this country, and want to 
enjoy the benefits of its trade, &c, this is the road to it â€” 
withholding them, and the consequences we feel at present 
continuing, war inevitably. 
</p><p>
This letter is written to you in extreme haste, while the 
papers respecting this subject are copying at the secretary 
of state's office, to go by express to New- York, for a vessel 
which we have just heard sails to-morrow ; you will readily 
perceive, therefore, I had no time for digesting, and as little 
for correcting it. I shall only add that you may be assured 
always of the sincere friendship and affection of 
</p><p>
Your obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
