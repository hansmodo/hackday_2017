MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : * * * Did you receive a letter a few days since, with one enclosed for F. Douglass? also a printed letter of mine, which I wished him to read ? Do write me every other 
day at least, I am so nervous and miserable. And Lizzie, dear, I fear we have not the least 
chance of success. Do remain in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> a little longer, and occupy yourself with the sewing 
of your friends. Then I shall be able to learn something about my business. In your heart 
you know there will be no success. Why do you not candidly express yourself to me ? Write me, 
if only a few lines, and that very frequently. R. called up on yesterday, with Judge Davis. 
* R. goes with Judge D. on Tuesday, to settle the estate, which will give us each about 
$25,000, with the income I told you of, $1,700 a year for each of us. You made a mistake about 
my house costing $2,700 it was $1,700. The $22,000 Congress gave me I spent for house and 
furniture, which, owing to the smallness of my income, I was obliged to leave. I mention about 
the division of the estate to you, dear Lizzie, because when it is done the papers will harp upon 
it. You can explain everything in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> ; please do so to every one. Please see H. G., if 
it should come out in the papers. I had hoped, if something was gained, to have immediately 
placed you in more pleasant circumstances. Do urge F. D. to add his name to the circular ; also 
get them to have Beecher s. There must not be an hour's delay in this. R. is very spiteful at 
present, and I think hurries up the division to cross my purposes. He mentioned yesterday 
that he was going to the Rocky Mountains so soon as Edgar Welles joined him. He is very deep.

Write me, do, when you receive this. Your silence pains me. 
</p><p>
Truly yours,
