Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Having returned to Congress a few days only, and 
private matters requiring my attention for great part 
of the time, I have not been able regularly to attend to business, or to acknowledge the receipt of your 
favor transmitted to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, after my leaving it, 
and sent after me to Virginia by <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'>Mr. Madison</a></a>. The 
moment for successful operations against our enemies 
was certainly immediately after the disaster in Gardiner's Ba}, when, had it been embraced, the port at 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and the troops under Arnold, as well as 
the British ships then in Virginia, must have fallen 
an easy conquest to our united efforts ; for which 
purpose the State was, I believe, in readiness. 
</p><p>
Abortive as the project has proven, we yet hope 
for the best, and that still it may be in the powder 
of our ally to give us effectual aid in the Chesapeake I and, believe me, at no time was it more necessary than at present, when all the lower country 
of our State, from its great navigable waters, is exposed to the ravage and rapine, not only of British ships of war, but of the vessels employed by 
the Board of Refugee Commissioners in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
To you it is unnecessary to describe the distress of 
the inhabitants upon the navigable waters of Virginia. 
Your knowledge of the country enables you sufficiently to judge of it, exclusive of such information 
as, I doubt not, you receive from that quarter. Had 
we a sufficient stock of arms, distressing as it is to 
our militia to be so generally out on duty, as it must 
be to them at this season of the year, I think they 
would do much in opposition to the enemy, supported even by no considerable body of regulars. But, 
wanting arms, their negroes flying from them, and 
their prospects of making little or nothing from their 
estates to support their families and bear the burdens of the war, may shake their fidelity and attachment to the cause so far as to slacken their exertions, if some succour is not afforded them by water, to restrain the ravage of these plunderers. I mention 
these things as facts falling under my own observation before I left the State, that, if they have not 
been more particularly communicated by others, you 
might hear some intimation of them. 
</p><p>
The late movements of Cornwallis and Phillips indicate a junction of their armies on the Roanoke, 
from whence they may direct their operations north 
or south, as they shall see best, without the fear of 
successful opposition ; or may, it would seem, cut off 
all communication between Virginia and the other 
Southern States, and reduce <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> to the 
greatest extremity. From these dangers, that at present threaten us, a naval force sent to the Chesapeake would at once relieve us, and admit Virginia 
to afford that succour to the other Southern States 
they so much need. The great object of the enemy 
is undoubtedly the Southern States ; and it is submitted to your reflection, how far you can support them 
by your influence, in the destination of such aids as 
may arrive from Europe, or the operation of that 
force now here. We are told all the ships of war 
have left <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, with about two thousand troops, 
after having once put back. Adieu ! Pardon the 
haste of this letter, which is written in Congress, in 
consequence of the President's information that an 
express was coming off for head-quarters. 
</p><p>
Yours, &c., 
</p><p>
