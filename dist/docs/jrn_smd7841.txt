A proclamation is out announcing that any one 
talking about the war, or present state of affairs, 
will be "summarily" dealt with. Now, seems to me 
11 summarily" is not exactly the word they mean, 
but still it has an imposing effect. What a sad state their affairs must be in, if they can't bear comment. 
An officer arrived day before yesterday, bringing the 
surprising intelligence that <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan</a> had captured 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> and fifty thousand prisoners; that is the 
time they talked. But when we received yesterday confirmation of his being finally defeated by our troops, 
and the capture of his railroad train twelve miles in 
length, they forbid further mention of the subject. 
I wonder if they expect to be obeyed? What a stretch 
of tyranny ! O free America ! You who uphold free 
people, free speech, free everything, what a foul blot 
of despotism rests on a once spotless name ! A nation 
of brave men, who wage war on women and lock 
them up in prisons for using their woman weapon, 
the tongue; a nation of free people who advocate 
despotism ; a nation of Brothers who bind the weaker 
ones hand and foot, and scourge them with military 
tyrants and other Free, Brotherly institutions; what 
a picture! Who would not be an American? One 
consolation is, that this proclamation, and the extraordinary care they take to suppress all news except what they themselves manufacture, proves me 
our cause is prospering more than they like us to know. I do believe day is about to break!

If our troops are determined to burn our houses over our heads to spite the Yankees, I wish they 
would hurry and have it over at once. Ten regiments of infantry are stationed at Camp Moore, and Scott's 
cavalry was expected at Greenwell yesterday, both preparing for an attack on <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>. If we must 
be beggars, let it come at once; I can't endure this suspense.
