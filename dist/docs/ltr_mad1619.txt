DEAR SIR, I was yesterday favored with yours of the 17th, 
18th, under the same cover with the papers from Mr. Pleasants. 
The circular letter from this State is certainly a matter of as 
much regret as the unanimity with which it passed is matter of 
surprize. I find it is every where, and particularly in Virginia, 
laid hold of as the signal for united exertions in pursuit of early 
amendments. In Pennsylvania, the anti-federal leaders are, I 
understand, soon to have a meeting at Harrisburg, in order to 
concert proper arrangements on the part of that State. I begin 
now to accede to the opinion, which has been avowed for some 
time by many, that the circumstances involved in the ratification of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> will prove more injurious than a rejection 
would have done. The latter would have rather alarmed the 
well-meaning anti-federalists elsewhere; would have had no ill 
effect on the other party; would have excited the indignation 
of the neighbouring States; and would have been necessarily 
followed by a speedy reconsideration of the subject. I am not 
able to account for the concurrence of the federal part of the 
convention in the circular address on any other principle than 
the determination to purchase an immediate ratification in any 
form or at any price, rather than disappoint this city of a chance 
for the new Congress. This solution is sufficiently justified by 
the eagerness displayed on this point, and the evident disposition to risk and sacrifice everything to it. Unfortunately, the 
disagreeable question continues to be undecided, and is now in 
a state more perplexing than ever. By the last vote taken, the 
whole arrangement was thrown out, and the departure of Rhode 
Island, and the refusal of North Carolina to participate further 
in the business, has left eleven States only to take it up anew. 
In this number there are not seven States for any place, and the 
disposition to relax, as usually happens, decreases with the progress of the contest. What and when the issue is to be, is really 
more than I can foresee. It is truly mortifying that the outset 
of the new government should be immediately preceded by such 
a display of locality as portends the continuance of the evil 
which has dishonored the old, and gives countenance to some 
of the most popular arguments which have been inculcated by 
the southern Federalists. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> has appeared to me extremely objectionable, on 
the following grounds: It violates too palpably the simple and 
obvious principle, that the seat of public business should be 
made as equally convenient to every part of the public as the 
requisite accommodations for executing the business will permit. This consideration has the more weight, as well on account of the catholic spirit professed by the Constitution, as of 
the increased resort which it will require from every quarter 
of the continent. It seems to be particularly essential that an 
eye should be had in all our public arrangements to the accommodation of the western country, which, perhaps, cannot be 
sufficiently gratified at any rate, but which might be furnished 
with new fuel to its jealousy by being summoned to the sea 
shore, and almost at one end of the continent. There are reasons, but of too confidential a nature for any other than verbal 
communication, which make it of critical importance that neither 
cause nor pretext should be given for distrusts in that quarter 
of the policy towards it in this. I have apprehended, also, that 
a preference so favorable to the Eastern States would be represented in the Southern as a decisive proof of the preponderance 
of that scale, and a justification of all the anti-federal arguments 
drawn from that danger. Adding to all this, the recollection 
that the first year or two will produce all the great arrangements under the new system, and which may fix its tone for a 
long time to come, it seems of real importance that the temporary residence of the new Congress, apart from its relation to 
the final residence, should not be thrown too much towards one 
extremity of the Union. It may, perhaps, be the more necessary to guard against suspicions of partiality in this case, as the 
early measures of the new Government, including a navigation 
act, will of course be most favorable to this extremity. 
</p><p>
But I own that I am much influenced by a view to the final 
residence, which I conceive to be more likely to be properly 
chosen in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> than in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. The extreme excentricity of the latter will certainly, in my opinion, bring on a 
premature, and consequently an improper choice. This policy 
is avowed by some of the sticklers for this place, and is known 
to prevail with the bulk of them. People from the interior 
parts of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, and Kentucky, will never patiently repeat their trips to 
this remote situation, especially as the Legislative sessions will 
be held in the winter season. Should no other consequence 
take place than a frequent or early agitation of this contentious 
subject, it would form a strong objection against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. 
</p><p>
Were there occasion to fear a repugnance to the establishment of a final seat, or a choice of a commercial city for the 
purpose, I should be strongly tempted to shun <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> at 
all events. But my only fear on the first head is, of a precipitancy in carrying that part of the Federal Constitution into 
effect, and on the second, the public sentiment, as well as other 
considerations, is so fixedly opposed as to banish the danger 
from my apprehensions. Judging from my own experience on 
this subject, I conclude, that from motives of one sort or another, 
ten States at least, (that is, five from each end of the Union,) 
to say nothing of the Western States, will, at any proper time, 
be ready to remove from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. The only difficulty that 
can arise will be that of agreeing on the place to be finally removed to, and it is from that difficulty alone, and the delay incident to it, that I derive my hope in favor of the banks of the 
Potowmac. There are some other combinations on the subject 
into which the discussion of it has led me, but I have already 
troubled you with more, I fear, than may deserv.your attention.

With every sentiment of esteem and attachment, I remain, 
dear sir, your obt and affect. serv.
