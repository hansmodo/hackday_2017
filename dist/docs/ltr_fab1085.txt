I began to think it had been a long time since I had heard from you. Hope this will find you enjoying the same health as myself, which is first-rate, except
occasionally on Mondays. I eat a very light dinner at an eating house during the week but on Sundays Sarah gets up a first-rate dinner. John generally comes round and we go into it strong, finishing off with melons, peaches and all kinds of fruit. It's no wonder that I have a slight pain in the stomach the next day.

I have hardly been out of the city this summer. On the fifth of July I took a trip to West Point. Had a fine time. Last week went on a picnic just out of Brooklyn in a grove, with the Thompsons. You remember Henrietta visited Fanny D. last summer. There are five young ladies in the family and there were about forty in the party. We rode out and after skylarking (these city girls run perfectly wild when they get a chance) round until dark, walked in by moonlight. Speaking of moonlight, we are having the most lovely nights that ever I saw and we have promenades and persons to enjoy them, which is one half, you know.

The other expedition which I made was to Coney Island, laying about ten miles from the city down to Sandy Hook. Here is a most splendid beach to go in bathing; a large pavilion with all the 'fixins' for eating and drinking, bowling alleys and pistol gallerys. It is the watering place for the poor million of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>. We poor devils who can't afford to go to Saratoga or Newport and such places. Thank Heaven we can go down here for a shilling and enjoy all the comfort in the way of a cool breeze and a swim in the surf, that are to be had anywhere. The weather has been delightful, as cool as down East.
