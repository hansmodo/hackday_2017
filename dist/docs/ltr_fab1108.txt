In looking over your letter, I think it rather dry, hardly worth 40¢. By the way, that letter from Gallao must have cost more than it would fetch if you ever got it. These steamers tuck it on but a dollar here is no more than a shillin in the States and you write as often and as much as you like and don't pay the postage again.

The two passengers that we took at Callao proved to be fine gentlemenly fellows, Peruvians, although one of
them came on board so drunk that we immediately put him to bed where he lay for three days and then came to himself and was all right until the glorious fourth, when he got rather patriotic. We celebrated the day with all the honors, fired the regular salutes, displayed the bunting and had, as far as we could see, the whole world to ourselves. And then, such a dinner: roast turkey and plum pudding! But perhaps one day you will have the pleasure of reading my journal. I made a full entry of the doings. Neither of these fellows could speak a word of English and one of them brought out his grammar and began to study. I thought it would be a capital chance to learn Spanish. I got my grammar and began. We taught each other and while I found it rather hard work to study at first, I persevered and learned a lesson every day. I had a good chance to practice, too, and by the time we arrived I could 'habla Espanola mucho.' I can translate it from a book with ease and converse quite fluently. There is plenty of it spoken here, although most of the people are Yankees, yet you meet in the streets people of all nations. Most of the foreignors are Chilenos, Peruvians and Mexicans and quite a sprinkling of the native Californians are seen wrapped in their gay-colored ponchos, with pants split open all the way down the side of the leg and buttoned up gaiter fashion. They make a great display, dashing through the streets on horseback. They are excellent riders and their saddles and stirrups would be a curiousity with you. I have ridden on one myself and it is like sitting in an arm chair compared to our hard things that we call saddles.

The death of J. K. Polk was received here by the steamer on Saturday. On Monday all the shipping displayed their flags at half-mast and the man of war fired minute guns.

I paid 50¢ for a Herald and gleaned all the news. The
cholera seems to be making a dreadful ravage among great men. Doesn't it kill any of the common people?

You speak of looking at my picture...It will give you a faint idea of me now. I have not put a razor to my face since leaving N.Y. It is not the fashion here, for it would cost a dollar. Dirty shirts are all the fashion as it would cost $12 per dozen to have them washed. Dust is very fashionable and common for the wind blows tremendously every day and kicks it up at a great rate. This is a great annoyance here and it is next to impossible to keep clean. The climate is cool and thick clothes are worn. The nights are foggy but I think it is healthy here. Up on the river people say it is sickly, very hot and plenty of mosquitoes. I have been at work hard since I arrived but enjoy good health.

You must excuse this scrawl for it is getting late and I can hardly see what I write. Captain Cole is spinning a long yarn to Sarah and I will drink your health in a glass of Italie and go to bed.
