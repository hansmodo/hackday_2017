MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
Your letter by way of Amsterdam had a quick 
passage, and was matter of great pleasure to me. 
I thank you for all your kind and friendly communications, by which you carry my imagination back 
to my friends and acquaintance, who were never 
dearer to me than they now are, though so far 
distant from me. 
</p><p>
I have really commiserated the unhappy refugees 
more than ever, and think no severer punishment 
need to be inflicted upon any mortals than that of 
banishment from their country and friends. Were 
it my case, I should pray for death and oblivion. 
The consolation which Bolingbroke comforted himself with would afford me little satisfaction ; for, 
though the same heavens were spread over me 
and the same sun enlightened me, I should see the 
heavens covered with darkness, and the sun bereft 
of its splendor. 
We reside here at this village, four miles distant 
from Paris. It is a very agreeable summer situation, but in winter I should prefer Paris, on manyaccounts ; but upon none more than that of society. 
The Americans who are in France, and with whom 
I have any acquaintance, all reside in Paris ; they 
would frequently fall in and spend an evening with 
us ; but to come four miles, unless by particular 
invitation, is what they do not think of ; so that our 
evenings, which are very long, are wholly by ourselves. You cannot wonder that we all long for the 
social friends whom we left in America, whose 
places are not to be supplied in Europe. I wish 
our worthy and sensible parson could visit us as he 
used to do in America ; his society would be very 
precious to us here. 
</p><p>
I go into Paris sometimes to the plays, of which 
I am very fond ; but I so severely pay for it, that I 
refrain many times upon account of my health. It 
never fails giving me a severe headache, and that in 
proportion as the house is thin or crowded, one, two, 
or three days after. We make it a pretty general 
rule to entertain company once a week. (I do not 
call a transient friend or acquaintance dining, by 
that name.) Upon those occasions, our company 
consists of fifteen, eighteen, or twenty, which commonly costs us as many guineas as there are persons. You will naturally be surprised at this, as I 
was when I first experienced it; but my weekly 
bills, all of which pass through my hands, and are 
paid by me, convince me of it. Every American 
who comes into Paris, no matter from what State, 
makes his visit, and pays his respects, to the American ministers; all of whom, in return, you must dine. 
Then there are the foreign ministers, from the different courts, who reside here, and some French 
gentlemen. In short, there is no end of the expense, 
which a person in a public character is obliged to 
be at. Yet our countrymen think their ministers 
are growing rich. Believe me, my dear sister, I 
am more anxious for my situation than I was before 
I came abroad. I then hoped that my husband, in 
his advanced years, would have been able to have 
laid up a little without toiling perpetually ; and, had 
I been with him from the first, he would have done 
it when the allowance of Congress was more liberal than it now is ; but cutting off live hundred 
[guineas] at one blow, and at the same time increasing our expenses, by removing us from place 
to place, is more than we are able to cope with, and 
I see no prospect but we must be losers at the end 
of the year. We are now cleverly situated. I have 
got a set of servants as good as I can expect to find ; 
such as I am pretty well satisfied with ; but I abprehend, that, in the month of January, we shall be 
obliged to give up our house, dismiss our servants, 
and make a journey to England. This is not yet 
fully agreed upon ; but, I suppose the next letters 
from the Court of England will determine it ; and 
this has been <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s destiny ever since he 
came abroad. His health, which has suffered greatly in the repeated attacks of the fevers he has had, 
obliges him to live out of cities. You cannot procure genteel lodgings in Paris under twenty-five or 
thirty guineas a month ; which is much dearer than 
we give for this house, besides the comfort of having 
your family to yourself. When I speak of twentyfive and thirty guineas per month, not a mouthful of 
food is included. 
</p><p>
As to speaking French, I make but little progress in that ; but I have acquired much more facility in reading it. My acquaintance with French 
ladies is very small. The Marquise de la Fayette 
was in the country when I first came, and continued 
out until November. Immediately upon her coming 
into Paris, I called and paid my compliments to her. 
She is a very agreeable lady, and speaks English 
with tolerable ease. We sent our servant, as is the 
custom, with our names, into the house, to inquire if 
she was at home. We were informed that she was 
not. The carriage was just turning from the door, 
when a servant came running out to inform us that 
Madame would be glad to see us ; upon which <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> carried me in and introduced me. The 
Marquise met me at the door, and with the freedom 
of an old acquaintance, and the rapture peculiar to 
the ladies of this nation, caught me by the hand and 
gave me a salute upon each cheek, most heartily 
rejoiced to see me. You would have supposed I 
had been some long absent friend, whom she dearly 
loved. She presented me to her mother and sister, 
who were present with her, all sitting together in 
her bed-room, quite en famille. One of the ladies 
was knitting. The Marquise herself was in a chintz 
gown. She is a middle-sized lady, sprightly and 
agreeable ; and professes herself strongly attached 
to Americans. She supports an amiable character, is fond of her children, and very attentive to 
them, which is not the general character of ladies 
of high rank in Europe. In a few days, she returned my visit, upon which we sent her a card of 
invitation to dine. She came ; we had a large 
company. There is not a lady in our country, 
who would have gone abroad to dine so little 
dressed ; and one of our fine American ladies, who 
sat by me, whispered to me, " Good Heavens ! how 
awfully she is dressed." I could not forbear returning the whisper, which I most sincerely despised, by replying, that the lady's rank sets her 
above the little formalities of dress. She had on a 
brown Florence gown and petticoat, which is the 
only silk, excepting satins, which are worn here in 
winter, a plain double gauze handkerchief, a 
pretty cap, with a white ribbon in it, and looked 
very neat. The rouge, 't is true, was not so artfully 
laid on, as upon the faces of the American ladies 
who were present. Whilst they were glittering 
with diamonds, watch-chains, girdle-buckles, &c, 
the Marquise was nowise ruffled by her own different appearance. A really well-bred French ladyhas the most ease in her manners, that you can 
possibly conceive of. It is studied by them as an 
art, and they render it nature. It requires some 
time, you know, before any fashion quite new becomes familiar to us. The dress of the French 
ladies has the most taste and variety in it, of any 
I have yet seen ; but these are topics I must reserve 
to amuse my young acquaintance with. I have 
seen none, however, who carry the extravagance of 
dress to such a height as the Americans who are 
here, some of whom, I have reason to think, live at 
an expense double what is allowed to the American 
ministers. They must, however, abide the consequences.

<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> has been sick, and confined to his 
house for six weeks. He is upon the recovery, 
though very weak and feeble. <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='met acquaintance'>Dr. Franklin</a> is 
much afflicted with his disorder, which prevents his 
going abroad, unless when the weather will permit 
him to walk.

12 December, 1784 
</p><p>
"Do you say that Scott has arrived in England ? " said I to my friend, when he returned from 
Paris, " and that Messrs. Tracy and Jackson have 
received their letters by the post, and that we have 
none ? How can this be ? News, too, of Mr. 
Smith's arrival." Thus passed the day, and the 
next which followed ; but in the e-'ening a letter was 
brought for J. Q. A. from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, from Charles 
Storer, informing us that he had received sundry 
large packets from America ; not being able to find 
a private conveyance, he had sent them by the new 
diligence, lately set up, which passed once a week 
from Calais to Paris. It was evening-. No sending 
in that night, because a servant could not get them. 
There was nothing to be done but to wait patiently 
until the next morning. As soon as breakfast was 
over, the carriage was ordered, and Mr. J. Q. A. 
set off for Paris. About two o'clock he returned, and 
was met with a " Well ; have you found the letters ? " " Yes, he had heard of them, but could 
not procure them ; they refused to deliver them at 
the post-office, because he had carried no proof that 
the letters belonged to the family ; he might be an 
impostor, for aught they knew, and they were answerable for them ; he scolded and fretted, but all 
to no purpose ; they finally promised to send them 
out in the evening to our hotel." O how provoking ! About eight in the evening, however, they 
were brought in and safely delivered, to our great 
joy. We were all together. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> in his 
easy-chair upon one side of the table, reading 
Plato's Laws ; Mrs. A. upon the other, reading Mr. 
St. John's " Letters " ; Abby, sitting upon the left 
hand, in a low chair, in a pensive posture ; enter 
J. Q. A. from his own room, with the letters in his 
hand, tied and sealed up, as if they were never 
to be read ; for Charles had put half a dozen new 
covers upon them. Mr. A. must cut and undo them 
leisurely, each one watching with eagerness. Finally, the originals were discovered ; " Here is one 
for you, my dear, and here is another; and here, 
Miss Abby, are four, five, upon my word, six, for 
you, and more yet for your mamma. Well, I fancy 
I shall come off but slenderly. One only for me." 
" Are there none for me, Sir ? " says Mr. J. Q. A., 
erecting his head, and walking away a little mortified. 
</p><p>
We then began to unseal and read ; and a rich 
repast we had. Thank you, my dear sister, for 
your part of the entertainment. I will not regret 
sending my journal, uncouth as I know it was ; to 
friends, who so nearly interest themselves in the 
welfare of each other, every event, as it passes, 
becomes an object of their attention. You will 
chide me, I suppose, for not relating to you an 
event, which took place in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> ; that of unexpectedly meeting there my long absent friend ; for, 
from his letters by my son, I had no idea that he 
would come. But you know, my dear sister, that 
poets and painters wisely draw a veil over those 
scenes, which surpass the pen of the one, and the 
pencil of the other. We were, indeed, a very, 
very happy family, once more met together, after a 
separation of four years. For particular reasons 
we remained but one day in England, after the 
arrival of Mr. A. We set off on Sunday morning, 
as I believe I have before related, in a coach, and 
our two servants in a post-chaise. As we travelled 
over the same part of the country which I had before described in my journey up to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, I was 
not particular in relating my journey to Dover. We 
were about twelve hours in crossing to Calais. 
</p><p>
The difference is so great between travelling 
through England and through France, that no person could possibly imagine that these countries were 
separated only by a few leagues. Their horses, 
their carriages, their postilions, their inns ! I know 
not how to point out the difference, unless you will 
suppose yourself a stranger in your own country, 
first entertained at Mr. Swan's, then at General 
Warren's, and next at Bracket's tavern. Such is 
the difference, I assure you. From Calais to Paris 
you pass through a number of villages, which have 
the most miserable appearance, in general ; the 
houses of the peasants being chiefly low, thatched 
huts, without a single glass window. Their fields 
were well cultivated, and we saw everywhere women and children laboring in them. There is not, 
however, that rich luxuriance, which beauteous 
England exhibits, nor have they ornamented their 
fields with the hedge, which gives England a vast 
advantage, in appearance, over this country. The 
place most worthy of notice between Calais and 
Paris, is Chantilly, where we stopped one day ; but, 
as I was so much fatigued with my journey, I made 
no minute of what I saw there, though richly worth 
a particular description. I must, therefore, request 
the favor of Mr. J. Q. A. to transcribe a few incorrect minutes from his journal, which will give you 
some idea of what we saw there. I have not a wish 
to repeat this journey in the winter season ; but I 
greatly fear we shall be obliged to do so, as England 
does not choose to treat in France. This, however, 
you will not mention at present ; as I cannot yet assure you what will be the result of the last despatches sent to that Court. 
</p><p>
This is the twelfth of December ; and a severer 
snow-storm than the present is seldom seen in our 
country at this season. I was pleased at the appearance, because it looked so American ; but the poor 
Frenchman will shrug his shoulders. 
</p><p>
I feel very loth to part with my son, and shall 
miss him more than I can express ; but I am convinced that it will be much for his advantage to spend 
one year at Harvard, provided he makes, as I have 
no reason to doubt, a suitable improvement of his 
time and talents ; the latter, the partiality of a mother 
would say, no young fellow of his age can boast 
superior ; yet there are many branches of knowledge 
in which he is deficient, and which, I think, he will 
be best able to acquire in his own country. I am 
sure he will acquire them with more pleasure to himself, because he will find there companions and 
associates. Besides, America is the theatre for a 
young fellow who has any ambition to distinguish 
himself in knowledge and literature ; so that, if his 
father consents, I think it not unlikely that you 
will see him in the course of next summer. I 
hope I shall follow him the next spring. Europe 
will have fewer charms for me then, than it has at 
present. 
</p><p>
I know not how to bid adieu. You did not say a 
word of uncle <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. How does he do ? My 
duty to him ; tell him, if Mr. A. was in <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a>, he 
would walk twice a week to see him. Madam <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, too, how is she ? My respects to her, and to Mr. 
Wibird, who, I think, misses me as much as I do his 
friendly visits. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
A. A,
