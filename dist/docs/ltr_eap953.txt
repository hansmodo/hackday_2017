My Own Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--To describe to you my anxiety for the last three weeks would be impossible, therefore you may judge what a relief your truly acceptable letter was to my mind. When I saw by the Ledger that Mr. Gunn had been dragged from his bed and murdered, and that several others employed in the office had been shot, I felt dreadfully distressed, and when I saw by another paper that the two proprietors, Mr. Gunn and Mr. Christman, had been murdered at Sonora, words would not describe my feelings. I saw the positive contradiction next day in the paper. Theodore assured me from the first that it was not true, for he said they were in the habit of making up that sort of lies in California.

My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, I am rejoiced to find that you are alive and well. But in a place where there are such bad times and such cold-blooded murderers, an innocent
man is not safe. They are the ones that suffer most. I firmly believe you would not remain from choice with such an uncivilized set of people, and be separated from all your friends and suffer so many privations. You say you cannot in justice to your friends and yourself return without giving that country a fair trial. I think you have. As to your friends, if they are not pleased, let them be displeased. You have made the effort and that is more than they would do. Suppose you are doing tolerably well. It will do you no good if you get sick there, for some person will rob you. If you have but one dollar left when you arrive in the borough of West Chester, you can give Mr. Henry Evans 50 cents of that and I am sure he would ask nothing more. Do not think, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, it is because I am anxious to get married that I write so. No, it is because I want to enjoy your company, and I want you away from such a dangerous set of people. Something seems to tell me you will be home this winter. I hope you have been so fortunate that you have come to this conclusion yourself.

My sister told me to send her best respects to you and says it is against her principles to advise anybody to remain in California.

Jeffries Babb has returned from California. He says he has made up his mind that he can make more money between here and there than he can in that country. He was in the mineral water business in San Francisco.

I remain yours most truly and affectionately,
