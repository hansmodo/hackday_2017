<p>
TO ANNA.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, July 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>.

Still, my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, must your sister write to you from the bed. My knee will 
keep me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> longer, I fear, than will be conducive to our health or interest. I have nothing new to tell you, 
for the town is dull and vacant. The President goes in a week, and we were all 
to go about the same time, but for the reason given. I feel now very impatient to 
be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a>, and have confidence in the change of air, though this place seems 
to be healthy, if terribly warm and dry. I had a long friendly note from the President yesterday, begging me to get Virginia's 
(his granddaughter) wedding garments, also trinkets and dresses for all the 
family. I shall drive to the shops, but am not able to alight ; and so little variety in 
Georgetown ; but I must do my best for them, and have promised to be at the wedding, if possible, the last of this month. 
But I have scarcely a wish, and no expectation of going. How I should rejoice to 
be with you, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, though I could not have the pleasure of playing nurse to 
you now, as I never leave my room but to drive. The Fourth of July I spent at the President s, sitting quite still, and amusing 
myself with the mob. Farewell.

Your own sister, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY </a>.
