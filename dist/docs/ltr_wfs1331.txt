HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a>, ACAPULCO ROAD, NINE MILES FROM MEXICO,

August 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>.

SIR: 
<p></p>
Leaving a competent garrison in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">Puebla</a>, this army 
advanced upon the capital, as follows : Twiggs's division, preceded by Harney's brigade of cavalry, the 
Tth ; Quitman's division of volunteers, with a small 
detachment of United States Marines, the 8th ; 
Worth's division, the 9th, and Pillow's division, the 
10th all in this month. On the 8th, I overtook, and 
then continued with the leading division. 
<p></p>
The corps were, at no time, beyond five hours, or 
supporting distance, apart ; and on descending into the 
basin of the capital (seventy-five miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">Puebla</a>) 
they became more closely approximated about the head 
of Lake Chalco, with Lake Tescuco a little in front and 
to the right. 
<p></p>
On the 12th and 13th, we pushed reconnaissances 
upon the Penon, an isolated mound (eight miles from 
Mexico) of great height, strongly fortified to the top 
(three tiers of works) and flooded around the base by 
the season of rain and sluices from the lakes. This 
mound close to the national road, commands the principal approach to the city from the east. No doubt it 
might have been carried, but at a great and disproportionate loss, and I was anxious to spare the lives of 
this gallant army for a general battle which I knew we 
had to win before capturing the city, or obtaining the 
great object of the campaign a just and honorable peace. 
<p></p>
Another reconnaissance (which I also accompanied) 
was directed the (13th) upon Mexicalcingo, to the left 
of the Pen on, a village at a fortified bridge across the 
outlet or canal, leading from Lake Jochimilco to the 
capital five miles from the latter. It might have 
been easy (masking the Penon) to force this passage ; 
but on the other side of the bridge, we should have 
found ourselves four miles from this (<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a>) 
road, on a narrow causeway, flanked on the right and 
left by water or boggy ground. 
<p></p>
Those difficulties, closely viewed, threw me back 
upon the project, long entertained, of turning the strong 
eastern defences of the city, by passing around south 
of Lake Chalco and Jochimilco, at the foot of the hills 
and mountains, so as to reach this point (<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a>), 
and hence to manoeuvre, on hard ground, though 
much broken, to the south and southwest of the capital, which has been more or less under our view, since 
the 10th instant. 
<p></p>
Accordingly, by a sudden inversion Worth's division, with Harney's cavalry brigade, leading we 
marched on the 15th instant. Pillow's and Quitman's 
divisions followed closely, and then Twiggs's division, 
which was left till the next day at Ayotla, in order to 
threaten the Penon and Mexicalcingo, and to deceive 
the enemy as long as practicable. 
<p></p>
Twiggs, on the 16th, marching from Ayotla toward 
Chalco (six miles), met a corps of more than double 
his numbers cavalry and infantry under General 
Valencia. Twiggs halted, deployed into line, and by 
a few rounds from Captain Taylor's field battery, dispersed the enemy, killing or wounding many men and 
horses. No other molestation has been experienced 
except a few random shots from guerilleros on the 
heights ; and the march of twenty-seven miles, over a 
route deemed impracticable by the enemy, is now accomplished by all the corps thanks to their indomitable zeal and physical energy. 
<p></p>
Arriving here, the 18th, Worth's division and 
Harney's cavalry were pushed forward a league, to 
reconnoitre and to carry, or to mask, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> on 
the direct road to the capital. This village was found 
strongly defended by field works, heavy guns, and a 
numerous garrison. It could only be turned by in 
fantry, to the left, over a field of volcanic stones and 
lava ; for, to our right, the ground was boggy. 
<p></p>
It was soon ascertained by the daring engineers, 
Captain Mason and Lieutenants Stevens and Tower, 
that the point could only be approached by the front, 
over a narrow causeway, flanked with wet ditches of 
great depth. Worth was ordered not to attack, but to 
threaten and to mask the place. 
<p></p>
The first shot fired from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> (the 18th) killed 
Captain S. Thornton, 2d Dragoons, a gallant officer, 
who was covering the operations with his company. 
<p></p>
The same day, a reconnaissance was commenced to 
the left of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a>, first over difficult grounds, 
and farther on, over the same field of volcanic matter 
which extends to the mountains, some five miles from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a>, toward Magdalena. This reconnaissance 
was continued to-day by Captain Lee, assisted by 
Lieutenants Beauregard and Tower, all of the Engineers ; who were joined in the afternoon by Major 
Smith of the same corps. Other divisions coming up, 
Pillow's was advanced to make a practicable road for 
heavy artillery, and Twiggs's thrown farther in front, 
to cover that operation ; for, by the partial reconnaissance of yesterday, Captain Lee discovered a large 
corps of observation in that direction, with a detachment of which his supports of cavalry and foot under 
Captain Kearny and Lieutenant-Colonel Griham, respectively, had a successful skirmish. 
<p></p>
By three o clock this afternoon, the advanced divisions came to a point where the new road could only 
be continued under the direct fire of twenty-two pieces 
of the enemy's artillery (most of them of large calibre) 
placed in a strong intrenched camp to oppose our 
operations, and surrounded by every advantage of 
ground, besides immense bodies of cavalry and infantry 
hourly reenforced from the city, over an excellent road 
beyond the volcanic field, and consequently beyond the 
reach of our cavalry and artillery. 
<p></p>
Arriving on the ground an hour later, I found that 
Pillow's and Twiggs's divisions had advanced to dislodge the enemy, picking their way (all officers on foot) 
along his front, and extending themselves toward the 
road from the city and the enemy's left. Captain 
Magruder's field battery, of 12 and 6-pounders, and 
Lieutenant Callender's battery of mountain howitzers 
and rockets, had also, with great difficulty, been advanced within range of the intrenched camp. These 
batteries, most gallantly served, suffered much in the 
course of the afternoon, from the enemy's superior 
weight of metal. 
<p></p>
The battle, though mostly stationary, continued to 
rage vrith great violence until nightfall. Brevet Brigadier-General P. F. Smith's and Brevet Colonel Riley's 
brigades (Twiggs s division), supported by Brigadier-Generals Pierce's and Cadwallader's brigades (Pillow's 
division), were more than three hours under a heavy 
fire of artillery and musketry along the almost impassable ravine in front and to the left of the intrenched camp. 
<p></p>
Besides the twenty-two pieces of artillery, the camp 
and ravine were defended closely by masses of infantry, 
and these again supported by clouds of cavalry at 
hand, hovering in view. Consequently no decided impression could be made by daylight on the enemy's 
most formidable position, because, independently of the 
difficulty of the ravine, our infantry, unaccompanied 
by cavalry and artillery, could not advance in column 
without being mowed down by the grape and canister 
of the batteries, nor advance in line without being 
ridden over by the enemy's numerous cavalry. All 
our corps, however, including Magruder's and Callender's light batteries, not only maintained the exposed 
positions early gained, but all attempted charges upon 
them, respectively particularly on Riley, twice closely 
engaged with cavalry in greatly superior numbers 
were repulsed and punished. 
<p></p>
From an eminence, soon after arriving near the 
scene, I observed the church and hamlet of Contreras 
(or Ansalda) on the road leading up from the capital 
through the intrenched camp to Magdalena, and seeing, at the same time, the stream of reinforcements 
advancing by that road from the city, I ordered 
(through Major-General Pillow) Colonel Morgan with 
his regiment, the 15th, till then held in reserve by 
Pillow, to move forward and to occupy Contreras (or 
Ansalda) being persuaded, if occupied, it would arrest the enemy's reinforcements and ultimately decide 
the battle. 
<p></p>
Hiley was already on the enemy's left, in advance 
of the hamlet. A few minutes later, Brigadier-General 
Shields with his volunteer brigade (New York and 
South Carolina regiments Quitman's division) coming 
up under my orders from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a>, I directed 
Shields to follow and sustain Morgan. These corps, 
over the extreme difficulties of ground partially covered with a low forest before described, reached Con 
treras, and found Cadwallader's brigade in position, 
observing the formidable movement from the capital, 
and much needing the timely reenforcement. 
<p></p>
It was alrea iy dark, and the cold rain had begun 
to fall in torrents upon our unsheltered troops ; for the 
hamlet, though a strong defensive position, could only 
hold the wounded men, and, unfortunately, the new 
regiments have little or nothing to eat in their haversacks. Wet, hungry, and without the possibility of 
sleep ; all our gallant corps, I learn, are fall of confidence, and only wait for the last hour of darkness to 
gain the positions whence to storm and carry the enemy's works. 
<p></p>
Of the seven officers despatched since about sun 
down, from my position opposite to the enemy's centre, 
and on this side of the volcanic field to communicate 
instructions to the hamlet not one has succeeded in 
getting through these difficulties increased by darkness. 
They have all returned. But the gallant and indefatigable Captain Lee, of the Engineers, who has been 
constantly with the operating forces, is (eleven o clock 
p. M.,) just in from Shields, Smith, Cadwallader, etc., 
to report as above, and to ask that a powerful diversion 
be made against the centre of the intrenched camp 
toward morning. 
<p></p>
Brigadier-General Twiggs cut off as above, from 
the part of his division beyond the impracticable 
ground, and Captain Lee are gone, under my orders, 
to collect the forces remaining on this side with which 
to make that diversion at about five o clock in the 
morning. 
<p></p>
And here I will end this report, commenced at its 
date, and in another, continue the narrative of the 
great events which now impend. 
<p></p>
I have the honor to be, etc., etc.,
