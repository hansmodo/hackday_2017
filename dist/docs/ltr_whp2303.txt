January 27th.

I am at the Hermitage, my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>, and cannot forbear writing you a
few lines, although I expected, before this time, to have been
favoured with a letter from you. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thb" rel="met friend">Mrs. Prevost</a> informs me that there is
the most flattering prospect of your soon being reinstated in your
health. The intelligence gives me real pleasure, and the more so,
because, until <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thb" rel="met friend">Mrs. Prevost</a> told me, I had no idea of your disorder
being so rooted and dangerous. May health soon revisit you, my good
friend; and when it does, may it continue with you for years. I am
pleased with the hope of seeing you in Jersey early in the spring. I
shall be this way again in March, when perhaps I shall meet you at
this place. I write this standing in the midst of company. I am called
off to court, and therefore, for this time, adieu.
