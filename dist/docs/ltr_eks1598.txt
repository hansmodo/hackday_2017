I have only time to write a line to say that as yet 
all is well. We have heard from our fort. Captain 
Walker, a gallant fellow, commanding a few Texan 
rangers, left there on the night of the fourth and suc 
ceeded in reaching here with dispatches from Major 
Brown. At that time the enemy had fired near fifteen 
hundred balls and shells at the work, without produc 
ing the least effect, and our eighteen-pounders had 
silenced most of their batteries. The enemy s shot 
are all made of copper, so you see we have the copper 
rage here as well as at the North. But one man had 
been killed in the fort, a sergeant of the Seventh, by 
the bursting of a shell. This afternoon we start back 
with the wagon train, but it is thought doubtful 
whether the enemy oppose our march.
