Dear Henry
</p><p>
   Yours of yesterday was received in due time and
being fully digested I embrace this privilege of writing to you again.
I was sorry to hear of your disappointment on Saturday last,
and can only measure your feelings by imagining what mine
would have been under corresponding circumstances. Saturday
was a day of interest and satisfaction to me having never
seen the like before, when I cast my eyes along the line, which
was formed along the one side of the street, with arms presented
and beheld the field of bayonets elevated above the heads of thous-
ands, and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
which is the Key-stone of the Arch, moving steadily and silently
along that line, with his penetrating eye firmly fixed upon them,
and his countenance remaining unmoved and apparently
speaking of the condition of the Country and the object for
which so many sons of labor had been called together, I was led
to exclaim, "who can tell what a day may bring forth."

From a person who came from Williamsport Md. yesterday
we learned that two Regiments of Secessionists had come there and
by yesterday's Tribune, that the plan is to come on through
until they reach Philadelphia, in order to get provisions,
should they attempt to carry out that design, we will
have a bloody time here, and you may be sure the men
here will give them a breakfast job at any rate, and I
hope Shippensburg and the Pines will, by the time they
reach you, have their 10 O'clock peace ready for
them and see that every man gets his portion due.
This is to much to trifle about, as it may be their
design, however I am not yet uneasy, but should they
come it may be that I might never see you again
let come what will, I expect to be prepared for the
worst that can happen [ to] me. The citizens of Chambrg.
are calm, and do not apprehend an attack from the
rebels from the South. I have not in my imagination
marked out the plan by which the present troubles
may be settled, but find that the opinion of some is
that war is the only remedy. if such be true then the
Northern boys must go to the work, and what could be
more cheering to the hearts of freeman such as we are,
than to see that the whole north will move to the work, as one mighty machine none of the parts
being wanting, but all complete, and all of which have
been tried in the days of '76, and found to be as true
a steel, and since the fall of Sumpter it has been greatly
strengthened and now is the Greatest Structure, and most
complet machine under the Canopy of Heaven, and
when it begins to move forward upon the foe, stretching
from the Atlantic to the Pacific,-every part reveling
in grandeur and might, not being driven by steam,
but the hearts blood of million, and the smiles
of Heaven, although moving slowly, its tread will
be the surer, and long before it reaches Cape Sable,
secession will be crushed out of existence, and like a
mighty cloud, it will rain Union sentiments on every
farm and plantation south of Mason's and Dixon's
Line. Let us start the ball rolling, and send seces
sion to the place from whence it came, you will now
allow me to tell you a little anecdote, which I heard a
few days ago Mr. -- [ A] said "that it has often been his
wonder what the D -- -l tempted people to sin for that
their sin could not make him any better," when Mr. -- [ B]
said, "Don't you know that he
is a secessionist
-that he was the first to seceed from Heaven, and consequently
the father of secession,"-more truth than joke-
This is a day of sweet recolection to me, being
the 21st day of May. "Rather let my right hand
forget her cunning and my tongue cleave to
the roof of my mouth," than for me to forget
my hours of unalloyed peace three years ago at
old Stony-Point, Those were the happy hours
of my life. And I hope the Friend I there formed
may be my friend for life-would to God
that all who participated in that season of
refreshment might be able to say-My labors
there have not been in vain, I hope you will
let your mind run back to that era in your
life and call to memory the hours that you with
me and many others spent there. Henry dear
remember then. I am looking for you this
week; dont forget to come. I have been interupted
a great deal while writing this, so that you
will find some trouble in reading it. write soon [ I]
if it is not to much trouble, I sometimes think
that I am imposing on your time to ask you to write
but I cant help it no person else will write
and I am very glad to hear from the pines.

Yours Forever
