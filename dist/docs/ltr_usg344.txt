MY DEAR MR. CORBIN:
</p><p>
Your letter of the 14th is just received. Mrs. Grant and I go on to New
York City on Monday night to meet Nellie and bring her home. It is not
probable that the vessel in which she sailed will reach New York City
before Tuesday morning, so that we will be in the city from Monday
morning until Tuesday night. If Jennie were at home I do not know but
we might go as far as Elizabeth on Saturday and remain over Sunday.--I
am much obliged to you for the offer of your kind offices. Probably it
will be pleasant for you to meet us on Tuesday on the vessel that
brings Mr. Borie and party home. What arrangement will be made I do not
know; but in all probability a revenue cutter will be put at my service
and I will be allowed to meet the vessel in the harbor below the city.
In that case I would be glad of your company down the bay.
</p><p>
My family are all very well.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
