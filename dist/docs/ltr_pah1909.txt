To the Ministers and Delegates of the Baptist Churches, and to the Members of Communion.

GENTLEMEN : I am exceedingly obliged to you for your very kind address, and the favorable sentiments you are pleased to entertain respecting my 
conduct, and the principles which have directed it. My constant endeavor shall be to guard the rights of all my fellow-citizens from every encroachment. 
</p><p>
I am happy to find a catholic spirit prevailing in our country, and that those religious distinctions, which formerly produced some heats, are now forgotten. Happy must every friend to virtue and America feel himself to perceive, that the only contest among us, at this critical and important period, 
is who shall be foremost to preserve our religious and civil liberties. My earnest wish is, that Christian charity, forbearance and love may unite all different persuasions as brethren who must perish or 
triumph together ; and I trust that the time is not far distant when we shall greet each other as peaceable possessors of that just and equal system of liberty adopted by the last Convention, and in support 
of which may God crown our arms with success. 
I am, gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
