MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE not been able of late to keep up my correspondence with you so constantly as my heart inclined 
me to do. But I hope now to write you oftener; but 
I don t incline to write very particularly, lest my letters should be intercepted. I am in tolerable health, 
but oppressed with a load of public cares. I have 
long foreseen that we should be brought down to a 
great degree of depression before the people of America would be convinced of their real danger, of the 
true causes of it, and be stimulated to take the necessary steps for a reformation. Government and law in 
the States, large taxation, and strict discipline in our 
armies, are the only things wanting as human means. 
These with the blessing of Heaven will certainly produce glory, triumph, liberty, and safety, and peace ; 
and nothing but these will do. 
</p><p>
I long with the utmost impatience to come home. 
Don t send a servant for me. The expense is so 
enormous that I cannot bear the thought of it. I will 
crawl home upon my little pony, and wait upon my 
self as well as I can. I think you had better sell my 
horse. 
</p><p>
The people are universally calling for fighting and 
for blood. Washington is getting into the humor of 
fighting, and Howe begins to dread it. And well he 
may. Fighting will certainly answer the end, al 
though we may be beaten every time for a great 
while. We have been heretofore greatly deceived 
concerning the numbers of militia. But there are 
numbers enough, if they knew how to fight, which as 
soon as their Generals will let them, they will learn. 
I am, with every tender sentiment, 
</p><p>
Yours forevermore.
