<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='23'>23d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. While Mr. Chesnut was in town I was at the Prestons. John Cochran and some other prisoners had 
asked to walk over the grounds, visit the Hampton Gardens, and some friends in Columbia. After the dreadful 
state of the public mind at the escape of one of the prison 
ers, General Preston was obliged to refuse his request. Mrs. Preston and the rest of us wanted him to say " Yes," and 
so find out who in Columbia were his treacherous friends. Pretty bold people they must be, to receive Yankee invaders 
in the midst of the row over one enemy already turned loose amid us.

General Preston said: " We are about to sacrifice life and fortune for a fickle multitude who will not stand up 
to us at last. The harsh comments made as to his lenient conduct to prisoners have embittered him. I told him 
what I had heard Captain Trenholm say in his speech. He said he would listen to no criticism except from a man with 
a musket on his shoulder, and who had beside enlisted for the war, had given up all, and had no choice but to succeed or die.
