DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the olst ultimo was delivered to me on the 4th 
instant. I feel very sensibly for you in your disagreeable situation. I wish the fatigue and anxiety you undergo may not impair your health ; and that you may succeed in your expectation 
with the savages, and soon give us the pleasure of seeing you 
here.

Captain Varick has been very active and industrious in procuring  the articles for the navy. Many are arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
and proper steps taken to procure the others. The carpenters 
go on with great spirit. Eight gondolas will be completed in a 
few days. One row-galley is gone to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and will soon 
be fitted and armed. Three others will be launched in ten days 
or a fortnight. Four others will be set up in a few days, great 
part of the timber being cut. Iron, sails, cordage, and anchors 
will be wanted in a few days. About two tons of the former is 
here, and six tons will be wanted to complete the galleys in 
hand ; twelve or fifteen tons will be necessary for the galleys to 
be set up. It will expedite the building if six or eight tons can be sent up in spikes from five to seven inches long, chiefly about six inches.

<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> transmitted to you, last week, the testimony of two French Captains, lately from Canada, which is contradicted 
by a Lieutenant B. Whitcomb, who was lately sent from Crown Point to St. John s, which place he left the 31st ultimo. He 
went down on the east side as far as <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, and returned on the west. Says he observed about forty bateaux at St. John's, 
and some others building, but no large vessels ; believes there were about two thousand men there, and one thousand between St. John's and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>. 
</p><p>
This afternoon I returned to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and in a few days propose to go down the Lake with the vessels completed, about ten sail. 
</p><p>
The militia come in very slowly ; not more than fifteen hundred have arrived. Our work at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> goes on briskly. 
The line will be completed in ten days or a fortnight. 
</p><p>
I am, with every sentiment of friendship and esteem, dear General, your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
