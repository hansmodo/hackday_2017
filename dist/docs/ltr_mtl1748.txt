MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : I wrote you on yesterday and am aware it was not a pleasant letter, although I wrote what I fear will turn out to be 
truths. It will be two weeks to-morrow since the legally attested consent from me was received 
by B. and K., and yet names have not been obtained for it, when last heard from. * 
However, we will soon see for ourselves. If you and I are honest in our motives and intentions, it 
is no reason all the world is so. * If I should gain nothing pecuniarily by the loud 
cry that has been made over my affairs, it has been a losing game indeed. * * 
</p><p>
And the laugh of the world will be against me if it turns out as I now think; there is 
no doubt it will be all failure. If they had issued those circulars when they should have 
done, before the election, then it would have been all right. Alas! alas! what a mistake it 
has all been! I have thought seriously over the whole business, and know what I am about. I 
am grateful for the sympathy of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=frd" rel="met friend">. F. Douglass</a> and Mr. Garnet. I see that F. D. is advertised 
to lecture in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">CHICAGO</a> some time this winter. Tell him, for me, he must call and see me ; give him 
my number. if I had been able to retain a house, I should have offered him apartments 
when he came to C. ; as it is, I have to content myself with lodgings. An ungrateful country 
this! I very much fear the malignity of Seward, Weed, and R. will operate in Congress the coming 
.winter, and that I will be denounced there, with their infamous and villanous falsehoods. The 
father of wickedness and lies will get those men when they pass away; and such fiends as 
they are, always linger in this mortal sphere. The agitation of mind has very much impaired 
my health. * * * * Why, why was not I taken when my darling husband was called from my side? I have been allowed no 
rest by those who, in my desolation, should have protected me. * * How dearly I should love to see you this very sad day. Never, 
dear Lizzie, think of my great nervousness the night before we parted ; I had been so harassed with my fears. 
</p><p>
Always yours,
