SIR: Your communication of the 29th instant was handed me this morning just as I was going to church, and of course was not read until I returned. 
I regret to find that you have entirely mistaken my note of the 13th 
instant. There is no part of it which calls in Question either your conduct 
or your motives in the case alluded to. Motives are to be inferred from 
actions, and judged of by our God. It had been intimated to me many 
years ago, that it was you, and not <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, who had been secretly endeavoring to destroy my reputation. These insinuations I indignantly repelled, upon the ground that you, in all your letters to me, professed to be 
my personal friend, and approved entirely my conduct in relation to the 
Seminole campaign. I had too exalted an opinion of your honor and 
frankness, to believe for one moment that you could be capable of such deception. Under the influence of these friendly feelings, (which I always 
entertained for you,) when I was presented with a copy of Mr. Crawford's 
letter, with that frankness which ever has, and I hope ever will characterize 
my conduct, I considered it due to you, and the friendly relations which 
had always existed between us, to lay it forthwith before you, and ask if 
the statements contained in that letter could be true. I repeat, I had a right 
to believe that you were my sincere friend, and, until now, never expected 
to have occasion to say ol you, in the language of Cassar, Rt tu Brute. 
The evidence which has brought me to this conclusion is abundantly contained in your letter now before me. In your and Mr. Crawford's dispute 
I have no interest whatever; but it may become necessary for -me hereafter, 
when I shall have more leisure, and the documents at hand, to place the subject in its proper light; to notice the historical facts and references in your 
communication, which will give a very different view of this subject. 
</p><p>
It is due to myself, however, to state that the knowledge of the Executive 
documents and orders in my possession will show conclusively that I had 
authority for all I did, and that your explanation of my powers, as declared 
to Governor Bibb, shows your own understanding of them. Your letter to 
me of the 29th, handed to-day, and now before me, is the first intimation 
to me that you ever entertained any other opinion or view of them. Your 
conduct, words, actions, and letters, I have ever thought, show this. Under 
standing you now, no further communication with you on this subject is necessary. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be 
</p><p>
Very respecfully, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,
