I spent quite a Yankee Thanksgiving. Dined at Uncle's with Arthur, Maria and Mrs. Peters and daughter. After dinner walked up to Tim Smith's and called on the Misses Baldwin and had a sing. In the evening treated myself to the Broadway Theatre for the first time. As usual, on a public night it was crammed full. The orchestra played Hail Columbia and Yankee Doodle and
the acting was very good, but the great attraction was the Ballet Company, The Monplasirs, that were performing there. As Johnathan Slicksays: 'It was a little the tallest dancing that ever I seed.' Madame is said to be next to Fanny Ellsler. She certainly throws herself most extensively. I enjoyed myself very much, on the whole, but I should have liked to have been at your merrymaking better. You must write me how the day was spent in B. and how the singing went.

Give my respects to all. Alfred and wife desire to be remembered to you and husband. All the Saints salute you.
