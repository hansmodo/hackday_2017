During the past two weeks the weather has been quite cool and threatened rain, and yesterday we had two good showers, the first since the beginning of April, which settled the dust completely. The rain was accompanied by heavy peals of thunder, and lightning, which I had not witnessed since my arrival in this country.

Another man has come into town to have his wounds dressed, having been attacked by three Indians while lying asleep under a tree during the night. This morning our sheriff went out and undertook to arrest two Indians. He was fired upon by several of them, but he fired at them, upon which they put off.

The great fever of excitement in relation to foreigners and the numerous murders that were being daily committed by them a month ago, has now abated. The guerilla bands have ceased their operations and we do not now hear of a horrid murder being perpetrated every day. I believe there have been only two men shot
in our streets since that time. Three-fourths of the Mexicans who were here a month ago have left the neighborhood for their old homes in Sonora, Mexico, with rather a bad opinion of Los Yankees. At Sacramento City a riot of a serious nature took place last week in which some ten or twelve persons were killed. When the people of California want to stir up a row, they don't talk long about it but shoulder their rifles, meet in the open field and shoot each other down, and that ends the matter.
