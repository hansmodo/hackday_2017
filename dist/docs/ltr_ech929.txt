Dear Prizer:--Enclosed with this half sheet you will find a long letter giving a full account of our voyage, which will answer for the perusal of the office and such other persons as you may think proper, and if you deem it worthy I should be pleased to see it published. But independent of this general letter, I must have a little confidential chitchat with you.
</p><p>
Should any more of our friends be coming this way, tell them to beware of such men as Finley and Hathaway, who are a pack of rascally swindlers. They have treated us in a most shameful manner and deserve the severest condemnation. They have us now entirely in their power or I think we would have some disturbances of a serious nature. You could hardly credit our horrible mode of living.
</p><p>
We have been a thundering long while coming this far and judging by the past we will hardly reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> before the first of March. I have often thought of the old Record office and its inmates, but notwithstanding our hardships, I have never for a moment wished to be back, and if I were, I should be ready to leave again on the morrow.
</p><p>
I have written a long letter to Miss Apple. Of her
sincere attachment I have not the least doubt. But has it lasted? will it last? are the questions. Perhaps you can answer them. Many ladies change with every flitting breeze and smile on every courtier, but I don't believe she's one of that kind. In fact, after reading the warm epistle she sent me in Philadelphia, I feel that it would be wrong to doubt her.
</p><p>
I suppose you and Cad Bradshaw are as thick as ever, perhaps married--and if not, how soon will you be? And the secret order of the Gideons? Do they all remain true to their vows of purity, or do they now pay attention to particular ladies?
</p><p>
I suppose you have heard from some of the California boys and that they have arrived in that place. I would be delighted to meet old Thornbury and Whitaker, and give them a handshake of the heart, upon our arrival.
</p><p>
Many of us fellows have not shaved since leaving Philadelphia and look like a set of pirates. I had a pretty extensive crop, but too it all off the other day except my imperial and mustachios.
</p><p>
But my sheet is full and I must close. My next I hope to mail at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and in the meantime I remain,
</p><p>
Truly yours,
</p><p>
