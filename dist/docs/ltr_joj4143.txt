Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your friendly letter of the 14th 
March last. I am happy in resuming my correspondence 
with my friends in England, and regret that it has been so 
long suspended. As <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a> will be the bearer of this 
letter, I refer you to him for information respecting the 
state of affairs here. You have heard of the appointment of 
this gentleman to succeed Mr. Pinckney. You are well 
acquainted with his qualifications for that place, and with his 
character, public and private. 
</p><p>
I thank you for making to <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> the intimation 
I requested relative to the intended present. I shall deem 
myself sufficiently honoured and gratified, if my endeavours 
should prove conducive to permanent peace and conciliation between our countries. This can, and I hope will, be 
accomplished. Nature has made few difficulties within 
the sphere of honest and rational policy, that are insuperable to prudence and perseverance. Mutual justice, mutual 
kindness, and a little mutual forbearance will ensure success. But it is to be remembered, that political, like other 
fields, require constant attention ; when neglected, they 
soon become unproductive, and fresh weeds, briers, and 
thorns will gradually spring up. 
</p><p>
The tide in human affairs, of which the poet speaks, now 
runs favourably, and will present a proper occasion for 
arranging our West India commerce. The war has, in a 
great degree, suspended the importance of it to us. When 
that suspension ceases, a strong sense of it will return, and 
will excite uneasiness which should be obviated or allayed by 
regulations as satisfactory as can well be made. Although 
a system more liberal than that in the twelfth article, if it 
had been immediately made, might have been ascribed to 
the pressure of circumstances, rather than to motives more 
pleasing and friendly : yet that objection has nearly lost its 
force, and passed its time ; for the treaty is now in operation, with the approbation of a decided and great majority 
of the people, and success attends your arms. 
</p><p>
While America has no just cause of complaint against 
Britain, nor Britain against America, their commercial and 
friendly relations will operate freely and effectually, and the 
designs of those who aim at discord between them will 
prove abortive. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Yours very sincerely, 
</p><p>
