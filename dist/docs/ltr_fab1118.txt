I saw the diadem of Fatooar, a mountain with its top resembling a crown. At twelve o'clock we were off the town of Papeetee. We were soon boarded by the pilot and with a fresh breeze the schooner was pointed for the opening in the reef. Borne on the summit of a tremendous roller, we leapt, as it were, the barrier and came down in a basin as smooth as a pond. The shore of the harbor is in the shape of a horseshoe and the natural breakwater outside makes it a fine harbor. Here we found three whalers and several other vessels; one was the 'Jane A. Hersey' from Bangor, loading for California. I went on shore with the pilot and Mr. Frazer and myself hired a house, all furnished, for ten dollars per month, and took our meals at the American Hotel kept by a Vermonter.
</p><p>
Our next call was on the American Consul, Mr. Gray of Boston. The Captain and myself took tea at his house during our stay. His wife is from Fryburg, Maine. He lives in first-rate style.
</p><p>
We took a stroll through the town which contains probably over one hundred houses and returned to the Hotel at eight to supper, with the idea that Papeetee was the loveliest spot we had ever seen. The very forests of Tahiti are composed of fruit trees, entirely, such as the breadfruit, banana, orange, cocoanut, guava, lime, apple,
etc. When such a climate and such a soil are brought under cultivation and laid out in gardens and these trees and flowers are trained by the hand of man and woman, you can imagine what a Paradise can be made.
</p><p>
The cottages of the foreigners are completely hidden in this beautiful foliage. Doctor Johnson has the most splendid garden I have ever seen. I thought if Mother could have such an assortment of flowers she would be perfectly satisfied.
</p><p>
At one end of the town are the barracks and residences of the French officers and a large public square. On this is the governor's palace and the palace of her majesty, Queen Pomari. There are 500 French soldiers stationed here. The French pretend to protect the government of the queen and as far as the governing of the natives goes, the queen and her chiefs have the sway, but regarding foreigners the French have all the say. They have built her a fine house and give her $5000 a year but the French are generally detested by the natives and by all the foreigners. Sentinels are stationed at every corner and at eight o'clock the gun fires and all are obliged to 'vamos.' Anyone caught in the streets is liable to be taken to the calaboose. You must get a permit to stop on shore and give forty-eight hours notice when you want to leave and a thousand other petty and foolish regulations which are not known in our free and enlightened country. Hurrah!
</p><p>
Now to resume the thread of my yarn. On Sunday I attended the native church. It is as large as our old meeting house was at home and well filled. The men wear a Pareu, or strip of calico which comes down to the ankles and over that a shirt. Some of the young dandies however, sport pants and coats and patent leather boots. The women wear a loose dress and some of them go into shoes and bonnets, but only on Sundays. They have the same fondness for flowers as those at the Marquesas and
dress their hair with great taste. Nearly all of them were provided with Bibles and hymn books in their native tongue and paid good attention to the minister. The singing was principally done by the women. After two or three verses I recognized the tune to be 'The hill of Zion yields, etc.' Their style is a little different from yours but some of them have good voices and the girls sing all the popular negro songs.
</p><p>
In the evenings the band performed in front of the governor's house and the grounds were filled with people. This is the time to see the beauty and fashion of Tahiti. They all turn out in their best clothes. Some of the ladies were dressed elegantly in satin and white muslin and I think their loose dresses are highly becoming, Wilkes to the contrary. Also their pretty Panama hats with a wreath of flowers look much better than a bonnet. They are barefooted to be sure, but then, where all go so you soon get used to it. The natives are darker than the Marquesans and generally not as handsome, although I saw some that would be called beautiful anywhere.
</p><p>
A great many foreigners have married natives. Captain Salmon of the 'Jane A. Hersey' is married to a sister of Queen Pomari. I saw her royal highness at Mr. Gray's store. She is about forty and still a fine looking woman. She has become pious of late and instead of spreeing around the island as she used to, she stays at home and speculates in oranges. She was dressed like any other woman and barefooted but the natives paid her a great deal of respect.
</p><p>
One afternoon in company with several friends, I rode out to the country house of Pomari, about four miles from Papeetee on the beach. There is a good road called the broom road which goes around the island, and plenty of horses. The country is pretty thickly settled and orange trees are as plentiful as firs at home. At this
season they are filled with fruit and the perfume fills the air. The house is situated right on the beach and is 100 feet by 30 and the finest bamboo house I have ever seen. The Queen was not there but a large family appears to reside in the house. They invited us in and as two of our party were acquainted we were at once made perfectly welcome and at home. By and by dinner was announced. It was served up in the Tahitian style: a leaf of banana was spread on the floor, or rather on the mats; on one side were six green cocoanuts with the tops knocked off and before each person a cocoanut shell filled with sop made of salt water and milk to eat the breadfruit in. We also had roast chicken and fish very much like sardines, with a dessert of fruit. We all pronounced the dinner 'maiu' (good) and after amusing ourselves watching the Vahines ride astride on horseback, we returned to town.
</p><p>
The last day of our stay a tremendous crowd of natives arrived from all parts of the island and also from the other islands: Ainieo, Mangia, etc., to attend the examinations of the schools. This is held here and in the presence of the governor, queen and chiefs. They also take advantage of this to have a grand Hoolah Hoolah, or native dance. I was astonished to witness this as I supposed the missionaries had long since done away with all their old heathen customs. But the whole population turned out to witness the performance and the native constables with Mutoi (police) on their hats, kept the crowd in good order.
</p><p>
A mat was spread on the ground and twenty five men dressed in white with yellow flowers in their hats, ranged themselves in a line. The music was supplied by four men playing on reed pipes, four on drums and six boys blowing through their hands. The men stood or sat still and jerked their bodies and arms into all manner of motions, keeping exact time and all making the same motions at once.
</p><p>
They must have drilled some. In front of this line the women performed. They began at one end of the line and danced toward each other, chasing forward and back, wriggling and twisting themselves equal to the India rubber man. I never shall forget one woman in a red dress. Madame Monplaisir would be nowhere in comparison to her. She and an old man danced a kind of minuet which ended in each trying to push the other off the mat, which excited roars of laughter.
</p><p>
They began at noon and kept it up until dark, getting more and more excited and they told me it would last four or five days. I am sorry to say that in the evening a great many of the dancers were intoxicated. This part of it belongs to civilization.
</p><p>
They have a salutation here--when you meet a native he says 'Your honor.' Where this came from I can't find out. They use it toward each other but it is not the native language.
</p><p>
We lay here twelve days and sold most of our hogs and the remnant of our trade and bought 46,400 oranges, 2000 limes, 1500 cocoanuts, bananas, pumpkins, wood water, etc. Oranges cost $5 per thousand. I made a great many acquaintances here and spent my time very agreeably, as you may well suppose. I know of no place where a person with a small sum of money could live and enjoy so much of life as here. Everything is cheap. In fact it grows spontaneously. You have only to pick it from the trees. Of course everybody is lazy. What little work there is done the natives do. They work well, too. I have made up my mind to go into the mines this summer and try my luck. If I succeed well, I may go into business again. If not I am not going to try to make money any more. I'll just come down to Tahiti and get a house and small piece of land and retire from all the trials, troubles and vexations of this wicked world and spend the remainder of my
days here. The natives are the happiest run of mortals I have ever seen; always good-natured, with no care or trouble. They laugh and grow fat. Some of the chiefs are enormous, great men and all are good size. They are pretty well civilized and a great many of them can read and write, have good houses and everything comfortable about them. The girls can play 'High low Jack' to perfection, as sundry bottles of ale that they won from me can testify and on Sunday and Thursday evenings, when the brass band performs they dance on the grass. Some of them dance the Polka and Waltze very well. For a savage people I like them very well.

I think by this time you must be tired of this letter and wish for the end. Well, we left on the 26th of March. Once more old Henry the Pilot guided us through the coral gateway and we were on the blue sea. We talked over the past events and I gazed on the beautiful landscape until darkness came on. The next morning it was not in sight.
</p><p>
We have been seven days sculling around among the Pamotu group. At times almost surrounded by coral reefs, but we fortunately did not strike any. The sun is now nearly exactly overhead. The altitude today at noon was 88°. I have added navigation to my other accomplishments and keep the reckoning with the Captain and consider myself competent to take charge of a vessel after this cruise. This is modest, you will think, but if I did not tell you of it, you would never know it.
</p><p>
The weather is terribly hot. We sleep on deck and dress very lightly. We live well and shall as long as the cargo lasts. We have on board 400 bbls sweet potatoes, 200 squashes, 46000 oranges, 40 hogs, 35 fowls, 90 dozen eggs, 4 bbls limes, 2000 cocoanuts and 50 bunches of bananas. If we were in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> now we might make something out of it, but I am afraid before we get there the
oranges will all rot and a good part of the potatoes. All I hope is that the cargo will sell for enough to pay the charter of the schooner.
</p><p>
Next winter I hope to be able to purchase a vessel and 'tread the monarch of her peopled deck.' I want to take another cruise in the Pacific and go as far as the Fiji and Navigators groups. I think the trade between California and these islands will be of great importance. Tahiti will be a favorite place of resort during the winter. At the Sandwich Islands everything is nearly as high as in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. There are too many foreigners there.
