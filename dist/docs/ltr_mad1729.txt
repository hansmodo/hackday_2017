DEAR SIR, I left home the day before yesterday, which was 
the date of my last; it was to be accompanied by 2, and perhaps, 
tho' not probably, 3 additional Numbers of Helvidius. The 
last, to wit, N. 5, contained two paragraphs, the one relating 
to the accession of Spain and Portugal to the war against 
France, the other to the answers of the President to the addresses on his Proclamation, which I particularly requested you 
to revise, and, if improper, to erase. The whole piece was more 
hurried than it ought to have been, and these paragraphs penned 
in the instant of my setting out, which had been delayed as late 
as would leave enough of the day for the journey. I mention 
this as the only apology for the gross error of fact committed 
with respect to the term neutrality, which, it is asserv.d, the 
President has not used in any of his answers. I find, on looking into them here, that he used it in the first of all, to the Merchants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and in one other, out of three which I 
have examined. I must make my conditional request, therefore, 
an absolute one, as to that passage. If he should forbear the 
use of the term in all his answers subsequent to the perversion 
of it by Pacificus, it will strengthen the argument used; but that 
must be a future and contingent consideration. Mr. D. R. was 
not arrived yesterday. The family here well; so, also, at Monticello, as you will, no doubt, learn from the spot itself. 
Adieu. Yrs aff tly .
