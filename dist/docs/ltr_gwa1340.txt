Dear Sir,
</p><p>
You will perceive by the inclosed letter (which was left for you at the office of Foreign Affairs when I made a journey to the Eastern States),
the motives, on which I acted with regard to yourself, and the occasion of my explaining them at that early period.
</p><p>
Having now reason to hope, from Mr. Trumbull's report, that you will be arrived at Norfolk before this time (on which event I would most
cordially congratulate you), and having a safe conveyance by Mr. Griffin, I forward your commission to Virginia; with a request to
be made acquainted with your sentiments as soon as you shall find it convenient to communicate them to me. With sentiments of very great esteem and regard,
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir,
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="me">George Washington</a>.
