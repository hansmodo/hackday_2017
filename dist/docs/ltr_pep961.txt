Dear Fellow:--I was very sorry to learn that you had not received two packages of letters which I forwarded to you. Each one contained a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a>. But I will not go over old ground. I received a package of letters from you, brought by a recent steamer from Chagres, containing letters for me and for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a>. I could have shouted for joy for thus hearing so directly and officially from you. I had been looking with great anxiety of your arrival at San Francisco in every arrival from California, and had almost begun to despair. You are much better off than I thought you would be. I think if you are blessed with health you will make a fortune in California. I hope you may find plenty
of the big " lumps." The specimen of your mining of the yellow ore is quite a curiosity.
</p><p>
I immediately delivered <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple's</a> letter. It was a welcome epistle to her. She often has fits of despondency, but is as devoted as ever, as the tone of her letters to you will attest. You ask if the " Apple remains sound." It affords me great pleasure to assure you that the Apple remains sound to the core.

Poor Whitaker's adventure to California has been a fatal one! His parents are almost irreconcilable, while many of his true and devoted friends lament his early loss. The melancholy intelligence of his death gave us cause to feel alarmed in regard to other adventurers in California. I hope and pray that Whitaker's fate may not be yours.
</p><p>
Your letters placed a decided veto on my going to California. Had you offered the least encouragement, in all probability I would have taken the Isthmus route instanter for the Gold Regions. But I place all confidence in your advice and believe you counsel me properly when you advise me to stay at home.

We have some rough-and-tumble times in the office. About two weeks ago Hunter was in the act of letting down a form in the trough when he slipped and let it fall into pi. Oh, what a mixture it presented! Nonpareil, Brevier, Minion all thrown together in one mass of rubbage. This was Monday night, and a more depressed set of boys never retired to rest. I dreamed of pi all night. However, we went to work next day and in three days we had it all cleared up and distributed. On Monday night last the machinery which regulates the impression was put out of order, and tore off the blanket in an awful manner. It was one o'clock before
we got her started. How I wished for your counsel to pilot me out of the difficulty.

The editor did not obtain his appointment to a foreign mission. He may be considered politically dead in this particular.

You are no doubt very anxious to know what I am doing with the ladies. In the first place, I do not find as much pleasure in their company as I did a year ago. I spend most of my time in the office, reading, which I find eventually to be the most profitable way to spend it. I go sometimes with Sallie Cope, and old friend, whom I hug occasionally when I feel like it, but she is rather old and tough. The charm is lost in this case. Miss Cope has a couple of cousins in the country, one of whom has almost taken my heart. I am going out to see them next Sunday, but I will not be responsible as to how far I may be carried away.

Mrs. Hunter's son is somewhere in California. She has written to you to that effect. I hope you may see him in your travels.

The State of California is knocking at the doors of Congress for admission into the Union, and has occupied the attention of both houses of Congress for four months past and ere this reaches you, it will form the 32d star in our firmament of States.

Tell Clint to hold out to the end. I am glad to hear of his good spirits.

Your old friend,

P.S. The editor's youngster is a boy, and he is proud of him. That reminds me that I ought to be doing something for my country. I was twenty-four years old on Monday.
