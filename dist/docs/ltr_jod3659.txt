MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
SATURDAY night, nine o clock, and not before, I received yours of 13th, and the letter to Thomas with 
it, brought here no doubt by mistake. I regret very 
much that you have not a gentleman with you. The 
skittish young colt with you is always timorous, but 
no harm will befall you or her, I trust. The weather 
and roads here on Saturday, Sunday, and to-day, are 
the finest we have seen this year. 
</p><p>
The election will be decided this day in favor of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, as it is given out by good authority. 
</p><p>
The burden upon me in nominating judges and 
consuls and other officers, in delivering over the furniture, in the ordinary business at the close of a session, 
and in preparing for my journey of five hundred miles through the mire, is and will be very heavy. 
My time will be all taken up. I pray you to continue to write me. My anxiety for you is a very distressing addition to all my other labors. 
</p><p>
Our bishop gave us a good discourse yesterday, 
and every body inquired after you. I was able to 
tell them you had arrived on Friday night at Baltimore. I sleep the better for having the shutters open, 
and all goes on well. I pray God to bless and pre 
serve you. 
</p><p>
I give a feast to-day to Indian kings and aristocrats. 
</p><p>
Ever 
</p><p>
