I wrote you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a>, which place I left on the 
fifteenth in command of my ragged battalion. It was 
a serious task to control such a heterogeneous body 
composed as it was of volunteers from different commands, sneaks and invalids of all the regular com 
panies who were left behind at this place when the 
army advanced. Nevertheless, by rigid discipline 
and close watching I succeeded in controlling them. 
The first day s march was within a short distance of 
the Rio Grande upon the Mexican side, through a 
tolerably fertile country with extensive corn fields 
and occasional sugar fields. The fruit trees were 
oranges, pomegranates, peaches, bananas, with a few 
other inferior tropical fruits, not being many, however, 
of any kind. The population was much greater than 
I anticipated, though in intelligence the inhabitants 
but little surpassed the aborigines of the west, and 
are certainly inferior to them in physical development. 
We advanced steadily on the second day to the city of 
Mier, on a branch of the Rio Grande, a neat and tolerably well-built Mexican town, the inhabitants of 
rather better character than any I had seen in the 
country. The stream on which it stands is a beautiful, clear, rapid torrent running over a rocky bed. 
From this place the route passed through Punta 
Aguada, Cerralvo, and Marina. The country became 
exceedingly rocky, broken, and barren, with very few 
inhabitants between the towns. The horizon was 
closed by the lofty Sierra whose blue summits were 
crowned with clouds. As we approached the mountains their peculiar character became more evident. 
They are undoubtedly of volcanic origin and of most 
sublime appearance, in one place shooting up to a 
vast height in a cluster of cones whose summits 
pierced the clouds, their sharp points showing above 
their fleecy belts, in another towering in huge beetling 
cliffs again broken into every fantastic shape, presenting on their lofty summits the appearance of 
ruined castles, cities, and fortifications. Immediately 
on passing through Marina, which was at noon on the 
twenty-second, the unsurpassably beautiful valley 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> broke upon our sight, lying in the lap 
of the mountains watered by numerous sparkling 
streams, smiling with verdure, dotted with rustic 
habitations, herds of cattle, droves of sheep and 
horses, and waving fields of maize and cane. Surrounded as this panorama is by the loftiest mountains 
I ever beheld, it certainly presented a combination of 
beauty and sublimity such as I have never seen 
equaled. On the twenty- third we reached General 
Taylor s camp which is three miles from the city. I 
reported and then proceeded to the city where the 
Second Division under General Worth to which the 
Fifth is attached is stationed. I soon embraced Edmund and was cordially greeted by my brother officers. Ted is quite ruddy from the mountain air. He 
has become quite a Spaniard and is decidedly the most 
popular officer of the army with the natives. He is 
a guest, and through his influence, I am, also, of one 
of the most distinguished men of the place, a member 
of Congress and once Governor of the Province, 
Yclept Don Jesus Treato. I have been incessantly 
on duty since I arrived, and am now a member of a 
General Court Martial writing this scrawl amid the 
cross-questioning of witnesses. I have been so occupied that I haven t had time to examine the features 
of the battle field. I have, however, already seen 
enough of the strength of the place to be utterly surprised that it should ever have been carried by storm. 
. . . Various speculations are current here in regard to 
the continuance of the war, and our movements after 
the termination of the armistice. It is thought General 
Taylor will not attempt any forward movements with 
his present means. . . .
