Dear Brother: ... Of course I have watched the 
progress of political events as they appear from this 
standpoint, and feel amazed to see the turn things have 
taken. Grant, who never was a Republican, is your candidate ; and Greeley, who never was a Democrat but quite 
the reverse, is the Democratic candidate. I infer that 
Grant will be re-elected, though several shrewd judges 
insist that Greeley will be our next President. . . . 
There are a great many Americans located here in 
business or prolonged stay, that constitute a society in 
themselves. They try to monopolize my spare time, yet I 
have managed to see M. Thiers, and the officers of Versailles, having dined with the President, and I am 
this moment back from a tour of the southern line of 
forts, Valerien, D'Issy, Vanves, and Montrouge, guided by 
a staff-officer especially appointed ; and I have appointed 
another day of next week to complete the circuit. En 
route to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> I saw Strasbourg, "Wissembourg, Saarbruck, 
Metz, and Sedan, so that I shall be able to understand the 
angry controversies that are sure to arise in the progress 
of the trials that I see it is resolved to put Bazaine and 
others through. . . . Choosing between the two candidates on national grounds, I surely prefer Grant ; as to 
platforms and parties, of course I regard these as mere 
traps to catch flies, but with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> as President, 
there will likely be more stability and quietude, which 
the country needs. . . . 
</p><p>
Truly yours,
