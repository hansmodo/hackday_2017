TO PHILIP MAZZEI.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">PHILADELPHIA</a>, July 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1781">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR FRIEND, I have received two copies of your favor 
of the 7th of December last, and three of that of the 30th of 
November preceding. Having neglected to bring with me from 
Virginia the cypher concerted between you and the Executive, 
I still remain ignorant of the paragraph in your last which I 
suppose the best worth knowing. 
</p><p>
The state of our affairs has undergone so many vicissitudes 
since you embarked for Europe, and I can so little judge how 
far you may have had intelligence of them, that I am at a loss 
where I ought to begin my narrative. As the present posture 
of them is the most interesting, I shall aim at nothing further 
at present than to give you some idea of that, referring to past 
events so far only as may be necessary to explain it. 
</p><p>
The insuperable difficulties which opposed a general conquest 
of America seemed as early as the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a> to have been felt 
by the enemy, and to have led them into the scheme of directing 
their operations and views against the Southern States only. 
Clinton accordingly removed with the principal part of his 
force from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> to South Carolina, and laid siege to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, which, after an honorable resistance, was compelled 
to surrender to a superiority of force. Our loss in men, besides 
the inhabitants of the town, was not less than two thousand. 
Clinton returned to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Cornwallis was left with 
about five thousand troops to pursue his conquests. General 
Gates was appointed to the command of the Southern department, in place of Lincoln, who commanded in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a> at the 
time of its capitulation. He met Cornwallis on the 16th of 
August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>, near Camden, in the upper part of South Carolina and on the border of North Carolina. A general action 
ensued, in which the American troops were defeated with considerable loss, though not without making the enemy pay a 
good price for their victory. Cornwallis continued his progress 
into North Carolina, but afterwards retreated to Camden. 
The defeat of Gates was followed by so general a clamor 
against him, that it was judged expedient to recall him. Greene 
was sent to succeed in the command. About the time of his 
arrival at the army, Cornwallis, having been reinforced from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, resumed his enterprise into North Carolina. A 
detachment of his best troops was totally defeated by Morgan 
with an inferior number, and consisting of a major part of militia detached from Greene's army. Five hundred were made 
prisoners, between two and three hundred killed and wounded, 
and about the like number escaped. This disaster, instead of 
checking the ardor of Cornwallis, afforded a new incentive to a 
rapid advance, in the hope of recovering his prisoners. The 
vigilance and activity, however, of Morgan, secured them. 
Cornwallis continued his pursuit as far as the Dan river, which 
divides North Carolina from Virginia. Greene, whose inferior 
force obliged him to recede this far before the enemy, received 
such succors of militia on his entering Virginia that the chase 
was reversed. Cornwallis, in his turn, retreated precipitately. 
Greene overtook him on his way to Wilmington, and attacked 
him. Although the ground was lost on our side, the British 
army was so much weakened by the loss of five or six hundred 
of their best troops, that their retreat towards Wilmington 
suffered little interruption. Greene pursued as long as any 
chance of reaching his prey remained, and then, leaving Cornwallis on his left, took an oblique direction towards Camden, 
which, with all the other posts in South Carolina except 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a> and Ninety-Six, have, in consequence, fallen again 
into our possession. His army lay before the latter when we 
last heard from him. It contained seven or eight hundred men 
and large quantities of stores. It is nearly two hundred miles 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, and, without some untoward accident, cannot 
fail of being taken. Greene has detachments all over South 
Carolina, some of them within a little distance of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>; 
and the resentments of the people against their late insolent 
masters ensure him all the aids they can give in re-establishing 
the American Government there. Great progress is also making in the redemption of Georgia. 
</p><p>
As soon as Cornwallis had refreshed his troops at Wilmington, abandoning his Southern conquests to their fate, he pushed 
forward into Virginia. The parricide Arnold had a detachment at Portsmouth when he lay on the Dan; Philips had reinforced him so powerfully from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, that the junction of 
the two armies at Petersburg could not be prevented. The 
whole force amounted to about six thousand men. The force 
under the Marquis De La Fayette, who commanded in Virginia, 
being greatly inferior, did not oppose them, but retreated into 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> and Culpeper in order to meet General Wayne, who 
was on his way from Pennsylvania to join him. Cornwallis 
advanced northward as far as Chesterfield, in the county of 
Caroline, having parties at the same time at Page's warehouse 
and other places in its vicinity. A party of horse, commanded 
by Tarleton, was sent with all the secrecy and celerity possible 
to surprise and take the General Assembly and Executive who 
had retreated from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> to Charlottesville. The vigilance 
of a young gentleman who discovered the design and rode express to Charlottesville prevented a complete surprise. As it 
was, several Delegates were caught, and the rest were within 
an hour of sharing the same fate. Among the captives was 
Colonel Lyon of Hanover. Mr. Kinlock, a member of Congress from South Carolina, was also caught at Mr. John 
Walker's, whose daughter he had married some time before. 
Governor Jefferson had a very narrow escape. The members 
of the Government rendezvoused at Stanton, where they soon 
made a House. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>'s year having expired, he declined 
a re-election, and General Nelson has taken his place. Tarleton's party retreated with as much celerity as it had advanced. 
On the junction of Wayne with the Marquis and the arrival of 
militia, the latter faced about and advanced rapidly on Cornwallis, who retreated to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, and thence precipitately to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a>, where he lay on the 27th ultimo. The Marquis 
pursued, and was at the same time within twenty miles of that 
place. One of his advanced parties had had a successful skirmish within six miles of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a>. Bellini has, I understand, abided patiently in the college the dangers and inconveniences of such a situation. I do not hear that the consequences 
have condemned the experiment. Such is the present state of 
the war in the Southern Department. In the Northern, the 
operations have been for a considerable time in a manner suspended. At present, a vigorous siege of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> by 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a>'s army, aided by five or six thousand French troops 
under Count De Rochambeau, is in contemplation, and will soon 
commence. As the English have the command of the water, 
the result of such an enterprise must be very uncertain. It is 
supposed, however, that it will certainly oblige the enemy to 
withdraw their force from the Southern States, which may be a 
more convenient mode of relieving them than by marching the 
troops from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> at this season of the year to the southward. On the whole, the probable conclusion of this campaign 
is, at this juncture, very flattering, the enemy being on the 
defensive in every quarter. 
</p><p>
The vicissitudes which our finances have undergone are as N 
great as those of the war, the depreciation of the old continental bills having arrived at forty, fifty, and sixty for one. 
Congress, on the 18th of March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>, resolved to displace 
them entirely from circulation, and substitute another currency, 
to be issued on better funds, and redeemable at a shorter period. 
For this purpose, they fixed the relative value of paper and 
specie at forty for one; directed the States to sink by taxes the 
whole two hundred millions in one year, and to provide proper 
funds for sinking in six years a new currency which was not 
to exceed ten millions of dollars, which was redeemable within 
that period, and to bear an interest of five per cent., payable in 
bills of exchange on Europe or hard money. The loan-office 
certificates granted by Congress are to be discharged at the 
value of the money at the time of the loan; a scale of depreciation being fixed by Congress for that purpose. This scheme 
has not yet been carried into full execution. The old bills are 
still unredeemed, in part, in some of the States, where they have 
depreciated to two, three, and four hundred for one. The new 
bills, which were to be issued only as the old ones were taken 
in, are consequently in a great degree still unissued; and the 
depreciation which they have already suffered has determined 
Congress and the States to issue as few more of them as possible. We seem to have pursued our paper projects as far as 
prudence will warrant. Our medium in future will be principally specie. The States are already levying taxes in it. As 
the paper disappears, the hard money comes forward into circulation. This revolution will also be greatly facilitated by the 
influx of Spanish dollars from the Havannah, where the Spanish 
forces employed against the Floridas consume immense quantities of our flour, and remit their dollars in payment. We 
also receive considerable assistance from the direct aids of our 
ally, and from the money expended among us by his auxiliary 
troops. These advantages, as they have been and are likely to 
be improved by the skill of Mr. Robert Morris, whom we have 
constituted minister of our finances, afford a more flattering 
prospect in this department of our affairs than has existed at 
any period of the war. 
</p><p>
The great advantage the enemy have over us lies in the 
superiority of their navy, which enables them continually to 
shift the war into defenceless places, and to weary out our 
troops by long marches. The squadron sent by our ally to our 
support did not arrive till a reinforcement on the part of the 
enemy had counteracted their views. They have been almost 
constantly blocked up at Rhode Island by the British fleet. 
The effects of a hurricane in the last spring on the latter gave 
a temporary advantage to the former, but circumstances delayed 
the improvement of it till the critical season was past. Mr. 
Destouches, who commanded the French fleet, nevertheless 
hazarded an expedition into Chesapeake bay. The object of it 
was to co-operate with the Marquis de la Fayette in an attack 
against Arnold, who lay at Portsmouth with about fifteen hundred British troops. Had he got into the bay, and taken a 
favorable station, the event would certainly have been adequate 
to our hopes. Unfortunately, the British fleet, which followed 
the French immediately from Rhode Island, reached the capes 
of Virginia first. On the arrival of the latter, a regular and 
fair combat took place. It lasted for several hours, and ended 
rather in favor of our allies. As the enemy, however, were 
nearest the capes, and one of the French ships had lost her 
rudder, and was otherwise much damaged, the commander 
thought it best to relinquish his object, and return to his former 
station. The damage sustained by the enemy, according to 
their own representation, exceeded that of the French; and as 
their number of ships and weight of metal were both superior, 
it does great honor to the gallantry and good conduct of Mr. 
Destouches. Congress, and indeed the public at large, were so 
sensible of this, that their particular thanks were given him on 
the occasion. 
</p><p>
No description can give you an adequate idea of the barbarity 
with which the enemy have conducted the war in the Southern 
States. Every outrage which humanity could suffer has been 
committed by them. Desolation rather than conquest seems to 
have been their object. They have acted more like desperate 
bands of robbers or buccaneers than like a nation making war 
for dominion. Negroes, horses, tobacco, &c., not the standards 
and arms of their antagonists, are the trophies which display 
their success. Rapes, murders, and the whole catalogue of 
individual cruelties, not protection and the distribution of 
justice, are the acts which characterize the sphere of their 
usurped jurisdiction. The advantage we derive from such proceedings would, if it were purchased on other terms than- the 
distresses of our citizens, fully compensate for the injury accruing to the public. They are a daily lesson to the people of the 
United States of the necessity of perseverance in the contest; 
and wherever the pressure of their local tyranny is removed, 
the subjects of it rise up as one man to avenge their wrongs 
and prevent a repetition of them. Those who have possessed 
a latent partiality for them, as their resentment is embittered 
by their disappointment, generally feel most sensibly their 
injuries and insults, and are the foremost in retaliating them. 
It is much to be regretted that these things are so little known 
in Europe. Were they published to the world in their true 
colors, the British nation would be hated by all nations as much 
as they have heretofore been feared by any, and all nations 
would be sensible of the policy of abridging a power which 
nothing else can prevent the abuse of.
