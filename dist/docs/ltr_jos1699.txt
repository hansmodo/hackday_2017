Dear Brother: . . . Just now all interest is centred 
upon the Presidential election. As you say, the Republicans are running a Democrat, and the Democrats a 
Republican. And there is not an essential difference 
in the platform of principle. The chief interest I feel in 
the canvass is the preservation of the Republican party, 
which I think essential to secure the fair enforcement 
of the results of the war. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> has so managed 
matters as to gain the very bitter and active hostility of 
many of the leading Republicans, and the personal indifference of most of the residue. He will, however, be 
fairly supported by the great mass of the Republicans, 
and I still hope and believe will be elected. The defections among Kepublieaiis will be made up by Democrats, 
who will not vote for Greeley.

The whole canvass is so extraordinary, that no result 
can be anticipated. You will notice that Sunnier, Thurinan, Banks, and others are for Greeley, who is probably 
the most unfit man for President, except Train, that has 
ever been mentioned. I intend to support Grant fairly 
and fully, as best for the country and Eepublican party. 
Affectionately yours,
