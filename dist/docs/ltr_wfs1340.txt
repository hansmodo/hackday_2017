Report No. 45. 
<p></p>
HEADQUARTERS OP THE ARMY,

MEXICO, February 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a>.

SIR: 
<p></p>
I have received no communication from the War 
Department, or the Adjutant -General s Office, since 
my last report (No. 44), dated the 2d instant ; but slips 
from newspapers and letters from "<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> have 
come to interested parties here, representing, I learn, 
that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</> has determined to place me before a 
court, for daring to enforce necessary discipline in this 
army against certain of its high officers ! I make only 
a passing comment upon these unofficial announce 
ments ; learning with pleasure, through the same 
sources, that I am to be superseded by Major-General 
Butler. Perhaps, after trial, I may be permitted to 
return to the United States. My poor services with 
this most gallant army are at length to be requited as I 
have long been led to expect they would be. 
<p></p>
I have the honor, etc., etc., 
<p></p>
