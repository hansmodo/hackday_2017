My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have barely a moment to thank you for your kind favour of the 11th . 
</p><p>
Congress, I am persuaded, will act with the dignity 
and virtue which ought to characterize republicans, 
in their answers to the British commissioners. The 
inquiry into the conduct of the late quarter masters, 
must give pleasure to every man who wishes to see 
the betrayers of public trusts brought to condign 
punishment. 
</p><p>
A party of the enemy were out yesterday, and in 
returning left a Mr "Welford formerly surgeon in 
their service. This gentleman made himself disagreeable to the British officers, by his humanity to 
our wounded, and was obliged to resign. He has 
taken an opportunity of becoming a willing prisoner 
to a people whose sentiments are congenial to his 
own. This, I suppose in delicacy to him, must be 
kept a secret. Cap*. McLane, an active, enterprising 
officer, who is constantly near the enemy's lines, sent 
him as a prisoner, and he must be announced as 
such. He quartered with General Lee last night, 
so that I had no opportunity of speaking to him ; it is 
probable he may furnish us with a great deal of good 
intelligence. 
</p><p>
I intend to write to you upon the subject of reforming our regiments, as the French call it. The weak, 
pitiful state of a great many of them, the little prospect of having them completed, the vast good that 
would result from purging the army of a number of 
officers, who besides are not unwilling to quit the 
service; in a word, the facility of bringing about a 
change which w'd be attended with more advantages 
than I have time to enumerate and develope, invites 
us irresistably to it. 
</p><p>
I pray God to continue his blessings to you. 
</p><p>

The <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron De Steuben</a> desires to be remembered to you. Some jealousies against him have occasioned 
Mm great trouble, and interrupted his progress in the military instruction.
