SIR, 
</p><p>
From the resolves, which I have the honor of 
transmitting herewith, you will perceive the measures 
Congress have taken to reenforce your army at this 
juncture. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
place a proper guard of militia at the passes in the 
Highlands, in case you should think proper to call 
to your assistance the troops under <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a>, 
which will be highly agreeable to Congress. 
</p><p>
I have likewise wrote to the Governor of New Jer 
sey, and to the Council of Safety of Pennsylvania, 
to call forth their militia at this important crisis. It 
is indeed devoutly to be wished, and is the earnest 
desire of Congress, that the army under your command may be made, not only strong enough to confine the enemy within their present quarters, and 
prevent them from getting supplies from the country, but totally subdue them before they can be further reenforced. You will, therefore, be pleased to 
write to the Colonels, or other commanding officers 
of the regiments that are raising in the New Eng 
land States, as well as those of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and New 
Jersey, and order them immediately to march the 
troops under their command, in the most expeditious 
manner, to head-quarters. Similar letters will be 
written by the Board of War to the commanding 
officers in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. I beg leave to refer your attention to the 
whole of the inclosed resolves. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 20th instant came to hand the 
24th, and was immediately laid before Congress. I 
have the honor to be, with sentiments of the great 
est esteem and respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. In consequence of your letters, and one 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, Congress have suspended their remove to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> for a few days. 
</p>
