My dear Sally, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your affectionate letters of the 17th 
and 21st instant. I am happy to hear of the health of yourself and son, and am pleased with your candour and sincerity on that subject. 
</p><p>
We have lately received an uncertain, though unpleasant, 
account of the enemy's landing at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. How did 
your nerves bear the shock ? My father and mother, I 
apprehend, were very uneasy. I should be happy, were it 
in my power, to bear all their as well as your misfortunes. 
The infirmities of age, added to the terrors and calamities 
of war, conspire in depriving them of ease and enjoyment. 
I most sensiBly feel for and pity them. God grant them the 
only remedy against the evils inseparable from humanity â€” 
fortitude founded on resignation. The moment I may 
suspect you to be exposed to clanger I shall set out for <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. As yet I think you very safe ; for, if the reports we 
have heard be true, the enemy's force is not sufficient to 
penetrate the country. 
</p><p>
I congratulate Peter on his recovery and return. Remind him of sending to Captain Piatt's for the barley. Let 
not the fear of the enemy deter him from pursuing the business of the farm. The same <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> which enables us 
to sow may enable us to reap. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear wife, 
</p><p>
Your very affectionate 
</p><p>
