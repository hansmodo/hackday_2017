DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with yours of this date. I flattered myself I 
should have had the pleasure of seeing you ere now, as, when I 
left <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a>, it was my principal business ; and, though it was 
dark when I crossed the river, I reached <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a> that 
night, when in hopes to have overtaken you there, but was too 
late, as you had left that the preceding day. Ever since I have 
been here, I have been so unwell as not to dare venture out, 
considering the badness of the weather; but the moment the rain 
ceases, I will set out for your quarters. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, in his letter of the 24th instant, gives me rea 
son to believe a large part of his army are on the move down 
each side of the river. Part of them had reached Hurley yesterday. He supposed the enemy yet to be up the river near <a href='/results.php?city=red hook' rel='city'>Red Hook</a>, and intended to retake Fort Montgomery before they 
could get down to reenforce it. For this purpose he was for 
warding a considerable train of artillery, and asked an interview 
with me at Coeyman's, this side of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, yesterday. I could 
not attend then for the reasons above, but wrote him, informing 
him of the different situation of the enemy, which will, of course, 
alter his intended plan. At the same time I suggested it as my 
opinion, that the enemy would not now attempt any thing capi 
l up the river this season, but detach their main force to 
strengthen Howe at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, to which grand scene we undoubtedly ought to turn our chief attention, for on our successes there every thing worth regarding depends. 
Yours, sincerely, 
</p><p>
