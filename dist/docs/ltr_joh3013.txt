SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 21st instant, by Mr. Bennett, 
with the inclosure, was duly received and laid before 
Congress, as you will perceive by the inclosed resolves, to which I beg leave to request your attention. 
</p><p>
Although the Commissioners have undoubtedly mistaken the intention of Congress, yet the terms in 
which the resolve is conceived, namely, " That the 
General be empowered to employ in Canada a number of Indians, not exceeding two thousand," may, at 
first view, seem to confine their employment to the 
limits of that Province, and to give a latitude of construction as to the place in which they are to be 
raised; and in this sense they must have been under 
stood by <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> and the other Commissioners. I am, however, to request you will give 
orders to have a stop put to raising the Mohegan 
and Stockbridge Indians, as soon as possible. I shall 
write <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a> to the same purpose. 
The conduct of the Quartermaster-General, in detaining the tents sent from this place to Massachusetts Bay, is a stretch of office which, though it may 
he well meant, is certainly a very extraordinary one. 
You will, therefore, be pleased to order them to he 
delivered up, and forwarded to the Massachusetts Bay 
as soon as possible. 
</p><p>
The other resolves, herewith transmitted, calculated 
to suppress insurrections and to promote good order 
and obedience to laws in the United Colonies, are so 
full and explicit that I need not enlarge. It is sufficient to observe, that internal convulsions do always 
extremely weaken the force and springs of Government, and must necessarily render its operations 
against foreign enemies less vigorous and decisive.
</p><p>
Application having been made to Congress with regard to victualling the Flying Camp, I am directed to request you will inform them what is the cost of a ration, as furnished by the Commissary-General. 
</p><p>
The several matters in your letters are before a Committee. The proposal respecting a troop of horse is liked; and as soon as the Committee bring in their 
report, and it is considered, you shall be made acquainted with the result. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
