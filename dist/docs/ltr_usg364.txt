Cramer was United States Minister to Switzerland from 1881 to <a href="/results.php?year=1885">1885</a>.
Simpson is U.S. Grant, son of Orvil Grant. Reference is made to the
customary resignation of diplomatic officials of the party opposed to
the incoming political party. Cleveland became President in <a href="/results.php?year=1885">1885</a>.]</p><hr>

DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
I am just in receipt of Jennie's letter of the 2nd of January. I am
busy on my book which Fred is copying for the press. I hope to have it
ready for the press by May next. But I may fail in this on account of
weakness. My mouth has been very sore, but not so bad I think as the
papers have made out. But it has been bad enough. The rest of the
family are all well.
</p><p>
My advice is that Mr. Cramer does not resign until he is asked to.
Simpson I do not suppose will be disturbed in his position. He is very
competent, and the soul of honor, both qualities wanted in the
Sub-treasury.
</p><p>
All send love.
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
