We were informed that a train of pack mules and teams were stopping for the night a few miles distant and would be along here on their way to the mines. We therefore concluded to wait until they came up, in the hope that we could get them to carry our baggage. A team arrived here about four Tuesday afternoon on its way to Mariposa Diggings. We agreed with the teamster, Mr. Cox, to carry our baggage for $50 and postponed our departure on account of the hard rain that had been falling for two days. He is from Iowa and has his family with him, consisting of his wife, and four or five children, all of them quite small except one. Among them are two little girls. He crossed the mountains and lost a great deal
on the road. It is ten months since he left home and he has been travelling ever since.

During the last two days two additional houses have been erected in the city and there are now three houses under roof and that many more lying on the landing ready framed for erection. They are mere frame shells brought from the States.

Early this morning, the weather being promising, we started on our long march, following a trail that leads along the prairie between the river and the mountains. Soon after we started, we chased up a large and beautiful hare. We next saw innumerable flocks of geese, duck and brant, and fired several balls at these flying, but without effect. We also saw a number of prairie squirrels that burrow in the ground.

Soon after dinner we fell in with four or five broken-down-lookingfellows on foot who were returning from the mines, and they gave us some rather discouraging accounts. They told us that they had been there some five or six months without being able to make anything, and that hundreds were there working for their board alone. This did not in the least abate our bright anticipations and we are determined to go and see for ourselves. About four in the afternoon we came to a small stream crossing the prairie, making the only camping ground for several miles; here we are now encamped for the night. We have just concluded supper, cooking nothing but a cup of chocolate and soaking pilot bread in it. Here are three tired boys! Oh, how my poor legs ache! I think I could almost rest forever.
