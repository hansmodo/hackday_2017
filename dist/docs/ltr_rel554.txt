<p><i>[Biographer's note:
My mother had arranged to start for Lexington on November 28th, via
the canal, but for some reason was prevented on that day.  In his next
letter, my father, who was most anxious that she should make the journey
before the bad weather set in, expresses his disappointment at not
finding her on the packet on the expected morning.]</i>

                           Lexington, Virginia, November 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>.

My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>:  I am much disappointed that you did not arrive on the
boat last night, and as you had determined when you wrote Saturday,
the 25th, to take the boat as it passed Tuesday, I fear you were
prevented either by the indisposition of yourself or of Robert's.  I
shall, however, hope that it was owing to some less distressing cause.
Our room is all ready and looks remarkably nice.  Mrs. Cocke, in her
great kindness, seems to have provided everything for it that you
require, and you will have nothing to do but to take possession.  The
ladies have also arranged the other rooms as far as the furniture
will allow.  They have put down the carpets in the parlour, dining-room,
and two chambers upstairs, and have put furniture in one room.  They
have also put up the curtains in the rooms downstairs, and put a table
and chairs in the dining-room.  We have, therefore, everything which
is required for living, as soon as the crockery, etc., arrives from
'Derwent,' of which as yet I have heard nothing.  Neither has the
furniture from Baltimore arrived, and the season is so far advanced
that we may be deprived of that all winter.  But with what we now have,
if we can get that from 'Derwent,' we shall do very well.  There is
some report of the packets between this place and Lynchburg being
withdrawn from the line, which renders me more uneasy about your
journey up.  This is a bright and beautiful morning, and there is no
indication of a change of weather, but the season is very uncertain,
and snow and ice may be upon us any day.  I think you had better come
now the first opportunity.  Do not take the boat which passes 'Bremo'
Saturday.  It reaches Lynchburg Sunday morning, arriving here Monday
night.  You would in that case have to lie at the wharf at Lynchburg
all day Sunday.  I have heard of Agnes' arrival in Richmond, and shall
be happy to have 'Precious Life' write me again.  I have engaged a man
for the balance of the year, who professes to know everything.  He
can at least make up fires, and go on errands, and attend to the yard
and stable.  I have heard nothing of Jimmy.  Give my kind regards to
all at 'Bremo.'  Custis is well and went to the boat to meet you this
morning.  The boat stops one and one-quarter miles from town.  Remain
aboard until we come.
</p><p>
                       Most affectionately yours,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>.
</p><p>
P.S.--Since writing the foregoing I have received your letter of
the 28th.  I shall expect you Saturday morning.        R. E. L.
