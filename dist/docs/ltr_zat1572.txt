My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Mr Kilbourn of the Artillery having determined to leave for a short 
time on sick leave, & will pass through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> on his way up the 
Mississippi, I have advised him to call at Barracks & advise with you as 
to the best mode of his getting through the city & on board of a steam 
boat as I very much regret to hear the yellow fever is in the city & proving fatal in a great many instances I need not ask you to give him 
such advice on this subject as may aid him avoiding the contageon if prac 
ticable, as he is a most excellent young officer. I wrote you at length by 
the last mail ; since nothing of importance has taken place in our front ; 
nothing official from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>s collumn, a report has reached here said 
to have been brought by a letter from an Englishman in the City of 
Mexico, to a friend in San Luis Potosi & by him to his friend in Saltillo, 
stating that on the 14t of the present month <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>s advance was 
then in sight of the capital, where the greatest confusion prevailed, & 
that negotiations were going on which he thought would result in a peace ; 
that Santa Anna was running about the city apparently out of his wits, & 
that he thought 500 resolute men could take the city 
</p><p>
I hope sincerely the yellow fever will not make its appearance at the 
Barracks, & that it will not do so ; at any rate that you will be very care 
ful of keeping out of the infected part of the city, as well as every as 
every where else as far as it was possible to do so ; as well as to take every 
other precaution, to keep from taking it as far as it was possible to do 
</p><p>
I rec d a letter by the mail which reached here a day or two since from 
Betty, dated the 2 d ins t saying they had reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> & were com 
fortably fixed ; that the company was numerous & pleasant, but the yel 
low fever had broken out in Mobile, as well as in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> ; that Ann 
of course, & the children nor Dick had reached there ; but hope they 
have done so before this, & are comfortably located 
</p><p>
I presume Jouett has taken his departure ere this 
</p><p>
My love to Ann & the children when you write, & wishing you & 
yours continued health & prosperity I remain 
</p><p>
Your Friend 
Truly
