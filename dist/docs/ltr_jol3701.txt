My dear General, 
</p><p>
Not to trouble your Excellency with a detail of 
writings, conferences, attendances, and imiDortunities, 
I pass at once to the result, as communicated to me 
by the Count de Vergennes. It is his most Christian 
Majesty's determination to guarantee a loan of ten 
millions of livres, to be opened in Holland, in favor 
of the United States, in addition to the gratuitous 
gift of six millions granted before my arrival, and 
four millions appropriated for the payment of bills of 
exchange drawn by Congress. The value of the clothing, ordnance, and military stores, of which articles 
I have delivered an estimate, reduced in proportion 
to the quantities already obtained and forwarded by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Dr. Franklin</a>, is to be deducted from the six millions. 
</p><p>
The distance of the manufacturing towns from the 
sea, renders it impossible to procure the woollen cloths 
at a short notice. The Marine department, which 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> imagined, from the similarity of uniforms, might be able to give us some assistance, has no reserve stores of this kind. The different regiments in the land service proidde their own 
clothing; so that there will be unavoidable difficulties 
and delays in procuring the quantity demanded. 
</p><p>
I am using my utmost efforts to prevail upon the 
Ministers to advance the ten millions from the treasury of France, and avail themselves of the proposed 
loan in Holland, for replacing the sum. This arrangement, it appears to me, can be attended with no possible inconvenience to the finances of France, and I 
need not add to your Excellency how invaluable this 
gain of time will be to America. I shall likewise 
endeavour to negotiate the ordnance and other military effects that may be supplied from the King's 
arsenal, on credit, to economize as much as possible 
the six millions. The Marquis de Castries has promised to make immediate arrangements for forwarding 
the supplies, and has renewed his assurances that a 
naval superiority will exist on the American coast 
the ensuing campaign. But there are not those dispositions made for maintaining it, that the success of 
the common cause demands ; and I am sorry to inform 
your Excellency, that the Ministry do not seem to 
approve of the siege of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> as an operation 
for the ensuing campaign. What may be the effect 
of farther and more particular conferences on the subject, I cannot determine. 
</p><p>
Inclosed your Excellency will receive extracts of 
letters intercepted in a packet bound from Falmouth 
to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. They were communicated to me by 
the Marquis de Castries, but do not appear to have 
made that impression on him and the rest of the 
Ministry which was reasonably to be expected. 
</p><p>
It mortifies me much, not to be able to announce 
to your Excellency the day of my departure from 
this country. It is impossible to express the impatience which I feel to return to my military functions, 
and to have opportunities of proving to your Excellency that I am unalterably, with the profoundest 
veneration and most tender attachment, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's faithful aid, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">John Laurens</a>. 
</p><p>
P. 8. I must trouble your Excellency to present 
my respects to Mrs. Washington, my love to the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met friend'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, and the rest 
of the family.
