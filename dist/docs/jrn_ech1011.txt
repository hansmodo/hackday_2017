This being Washington's birthday anniversary, the flags of the shipping were floating all day and guns were fired at regular intervals. In the evening, rockets were seen flying in all directions. About ten o'clock the Panama mail steamer came in with about four hundred passengers. I bought a New York Tribune for California, for which I willingly paid two bits and considered myself lucky, they having sold an hour previous at a dollar per copy. It was dated the 17th ult. and was therefore thirty-five days on the way, a tolerable quick passage, by the way. Also I found a paper containing old "Zack's" message. I read it with
great interest and heartily agree with the old man in most of his recommendations.

Hearing that printers were wanted at San José to print the laws of California, I went up to the city yesterday and made some enquiry about the matter but the information I received was vague and unsatisfactory. I therefore dropt the matter and thought no more about it. In the afternoon Atkins and myself slung our rifles over our shoulders and rambled several miles along the bay, meeting with little but high rugged bluffs interspersed here and there by gentle slopes coming down to the water's edge. We met with no game but ducks and water birds and they took good care to keep plenty far enough out of harm's way. We therefore posted up a target and exercised in this way.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> is built upon a kind of crescent between the hills and an arm of the bay. It is regularly laid out, the streets crossing each other at right angles. The Grand Plaza is now nothing but a vacant square in a central part of the town, but will doubtless improve as the city improves and may in time become a handsome place. One-half of the dwellings are composed of canvas tents, and about one-third of the buildings are hotels and gambling houses. We visited a great number of the latter places where we saw all kinds of gaming going on. Gambling here is an occupation, day or night, Sunday or any other time. The grey-headed father and the beardless boy are seen side by side vying with each other who can win or lose the fastest, and even beautiful women engage in these games with the same earnestness of the sterner sex, betting their last ounce. I have even heard of preachers delivering a good sermon and going directly from the pulpit to the gaming table. McGowan, one of the Chester County bank robbers, is
here patronizing these establishments and men of his stamp and character are to be met with by hundreds. "Yankee" Sullivan, the notorious pugilist, arrived here in the last steamer and now constitutes a bright star in this constellation.

The new custom house is a fine building and quite an ornament to the town. The court house is a very small one-story frame, not half as prepossessing as one of our county school houses. Here the grave judge and his associates sit and deal out justice to the crowd, and judging from the pile of bedding stowed in one corner, it is reasonable to suppose they sleep there also. The city has but one wharf, but more are building and for the privilege of landing a single trunk, you are charged a cool dollar. Money here goes like dirt; everything costs a dollar or dollars. What is considered a fortune at home is here mere pocket money. Today I purchased a single potato for 45 cents.
