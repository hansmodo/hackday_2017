I have long thought of you My Dear Ann, and sympathized in the anxiety, which I knew must silently be preying 
on your peace of mind- on account of your Son Jo Shelby whose name I have seen mentioned in the Southern Army, 
so fatal to our Beloved Gary- I heard previously to your letter, of the hopes entertained that we should probably 
recover his dear remains- and trust his good brother Bernard may have the consolation of bringing to his bereaved Father 
the privilege of depositing them in holy ground. 
</p><p>
Dear dear Ann, what changes have taken place in our once happy country. One can hardly realize they are at 
home - in the U. S. of America- and are at war with each other- I have been reading some loving letters from some so 
near to me in blood & affections whose arms are perhaps now raised against the hearts at which they have fed- and the 
bosoms of those, who have cherished them- this I cannot but lament as among the horrors of war. The recent news from 
Kentucky is very cheering. God grant you may be successful- and retain your allegiance to the Union- such men as 
Holt & Anderson & Crittenden must encourage your patriots to fight in the good cause. I hope the Governer will be true to his promise- 
</p><p>
Just received your letter of the gth thanks Dearest Sister, for your consideration of me, in the agitation of such a 
moment- I pray with you, that our beloved Ben, may be comforted, and like David, resigned to the dispensation of 
the Almighty- hoping, tho his beloved son, can no more come to him- they shall be reunited in another world- How I 
wish by sharing I could lessen My poor brother's grief ! 
</p><p>
I sympathize with you, too My dear Ann, in the anxiety which is so harassing by the uncertain accounts the papers 
bring of the contending Armies- we may pray for Jos personal safety- tho' we cannot for the success of his arms- 
Faith in Him, who in justice & in Mercy rules over the destiny of all, must give us patience! Tomorrow will be a 
holy day with us- Sabbath & day of Atonement, when memorials of the dead mingle with petitions for the living- 
and we endeavour to purify ourselves by devotion, confession & repentance - you will all be remembered by me, in the house of prayer- 
</p><p>
My health has greatly improved within a few weeks. I feel stronger than during the hot weather, and live very 
quietly. Miriam Etting dined with me yesterday, and asked me to give love & sympathy to her Uncle & you- my tender 
greetings to all around you- and grateful affection to yourself My dear Ann
