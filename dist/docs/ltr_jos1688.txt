Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I see no real occasion for trouble with Johnson. The 
great error of his life was in not acquiescing in and 
supporting the 14th Amendment of the Constitution 
in the Thirty-ninth Congress. This he could easily have 
carried. It referred the suffrage question to each State, 
and if adopted long ago the whole controversy would 
have culminated; or if further opposed by the extreme 
Radicals, they would have been easily beaten. Now I 
see nothing short of universal suffrage and universal 
amnesty as the basis. When you come on, I suggest 
that you give out that you go on to make your annual 
report and settle Indian affairs. Give us notice when 
you will be on, and come directly to my house, where we 
will make you one of the family.

Grant, I think, is inevitably a candidate. He allows 
himself to drift into a position where he can't decline if 
he would, and I feel sure he don't want to decline. My 
judgment is that Chase is better for the country and for 
Grant himself, but I will not quarrel with what I cannot control.
