The Vice-President, Dallas, called this morning and informed me that he had learned through the telegraph that Senator Barrow of Louisiana died at five o'clock this morning at Baltimore. Mr. Barrow, I learn, left this city four or five days ago, apparently in good health. It is represented to me that the day before he left he was the bearer of a note from Mr. Garret Davis of Kentucky to Mr. Bailey of Virginia relat ing to a misunderstanding between these two gentlemen which had arisen in debate in the House of Representatives. Mr. Barrow, as I am informed, accompanied Mr. Davis to Baltimore, where the terms of a duel or hostile meeting would be arranged. It was in the prosecution of this unchristian object that Mr. Barrow was suddenly seized with disease and cut off in the prime and vigour of life. I am a firm believer that it was a judgment of heaven upon the immoral, unchristian, and savage practice of duelling.
