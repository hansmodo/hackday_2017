Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for the books you have been so 
kind as to send me, and which, with your friendly letter of 
the 11th inst., were delivered to me yesterday. Except 
while at church, I have employed this day in reading 
the first, and part of the second volume ; and expect to 
finish the perusal of the remainder next Sunday. I have 
long been of opinion, that the evidence of the truth of 
Christianity, requires only to be carefully examined to produce conviction in candid minds ; and I think they who 
undertake that task, will derive advantages from your 
enumeration of many interesting facts ; your remarks on 
various heads and topics ; and from your references to the 
numerous authors proper to be consulted, and some of 
whom are but little known. 
</p><p>
As to " The Age of Reason," it never appeared to me to 
have been written from a disinterested love of truth, or 
of mankind : nor am I persuaded, that either of those motives induced certain characters to take such singular pains 
to distribute and give it reputation and currency in this 
country. Religion, morality, and a virtuous and enlightened clergy, will always be impediments to the progress 
and success of certain systems and designs ; and therefore 
n ill not cease to experience both direct and indirect hostilities from those who meditate or embark in them, 
With the best wishes for your health and happiness, I am, 
dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
