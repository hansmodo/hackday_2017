Dear Brother : At last the order is out and I am Colonel 13 Infantry. I have been asking for orders and am 
this moment informed for the present, that inasmuch as 
Lt. Col. Burbank may enlist my Eegiment, and as my personal services here are needed, I will forthwith consider 
myself on duty here attached to Gen. Scott's staff as 
Inspector General. I did not dream of this, but it really 
does well accord with my inclinations and peculiar 
nature. My duty will be to keep myself advised of the 
character and kind of men who are in Military service 
here near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> and to report to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague met">General Scott</a> 
in person. Porter can tell you what these duties will 
amount to. ... I suppose you will soon be here, for 
from Col. Burnside I hear all of Patterson's army is on 
the Maryland side of the Potomac, and no possible movement will be attempted before Congress meets. . . . 
In haste, 
</p><p>
Your Brother, 
</p><p>
