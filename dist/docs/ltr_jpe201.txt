Dear <a href="results.php?tla=rte" rel="spouse">Ruth</a>,
<p>
Never have I ever been so pleased to hear from anyone and I want to thank you for your newsy letter.  Your letter has brought back to me the old days at <a href="http://www.fhs.fuhsd.org/school.html" rel="tag">Fremont</a> and the good times that we had there together.
</p>
<p>
In view of world unrest I rejoined the Naval reserve on Dec. 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1940">1940</a> and was called to active duty on Dec. 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1940">1940</a>.  I was sent to the east coast to school and since then have been out here.  I was very much present at the little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_Attack" rel="tag">surprise party</a> held here for us on Dec.7, last, by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" rel="tag">little yellow men</a>.
</p>
<p>
Prior to being recalled to service I was employed as Stock and Statistical clerk at the <a href="http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6199q2qz/">H.L. Benbough Co.</a> in San Diego.  I expect to return there when this job is over.
</p>
<p>
My <a href="results.php?tla=jepe" rel="parent">father</a> is port engineer for the California Shipbuilding Co. in Long Beach.
</p>
<p>
Please write as I like very much to hear from you.  Also remember me to all the Family and old Friends.
</p>  
Sincerely yours,<br>

P.S.  Sorry I can't write more now but will reply to all your letters as well as the censor will allow.
