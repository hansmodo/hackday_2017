MAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 12th by Colonel Zagonyi is just
received. In answer to the principal part of it, I repeat the
substance of an order of the 8th and one or two telegraphic
despatches sent you since.
</p><p>
We have no definite power of sending reinforcements; so that we are
compelled rather to consider the proper disposal of the forces we
have than of those we could wish to have. We may be able to send you
some dribs by degrees, but I do not believe we can do more. As you
alone beat <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tjj" rel="contact">Jackson</a> last Sunday, I argue that you are stronger than he
is to-day, unless he has been reinforced; and that he cannot have
been materially reinforced, because such reinforcement could only
have come from Richmond, and he is much more likely to go to Richmond
than Richmond is to come to him.  Neither is very likely. I think
Jackson's game--his assigned work--now is to magnify the accounts of
his numbers and reports of his movements, and thus by constant alarms
keep three or four times as many of our troops away from Richmond as
his own force amounts to. Thus he helps his friends at Richmond
three or four times as much as if he were there. Our game is not to
allow this. Accordingly, by the order of the 8th, I directed you to
halt at Harrisonburg, rest your force, and get it well in hand, the
objects being to guard against Jackson's returning by the same route
to the upper Potomac over which you have just driven him out, and at
the same time give some protection against a raid into West Virginia.
</p><p>
Already I have given you discretion to occupy Mount Jackson instead,
if, on full consideration, you think best. I do not believe Jackson
will attack you, but certainly he cannot attack you by surprise; and
if he comes upon you in superior force, you have but to notify us,
fall back cautiously, and Banks will join you in due time. But while
we know not whether Jackson will move at all, or by what route, we
cannot safely put you and Banks both on the Strasburg line, and leave
no force on the Front Royal line--the very line upon which he
prosecuted his late raid. The true policy is to place one of you on
one line and the other on the other in such positions that you can
unite once you actually find <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tjj" rel="contact">Jackson</a> moving upon it. And this is
precisely what we are doing. This protects that part of our
frontier, so to speak, and liberates McDowell to go to the assistance
of McClellan. I have arranged this, and am very unwilling to have it
deranged. While you have only asked for Sigel, I have spoken only of
Banks, and this because Sigel's force is now the principal part of
Bank's force.
</p><p>
About transferring General Schenck's commands, the purchase of
supplies, and the promotion and appointment of officers, mentioned in
your letter, I will consult with the Secretary of War to-morrow.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
<p>
