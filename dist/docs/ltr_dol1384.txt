MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, John Randolph has been firing away at the " House " this 
morning against the declaration of war, but we think it will have little effect. I 
told you of the Hornet and all the news it brought. We have nothing among our 
selves worth repeating. Lucy writes often and is still delighted with Kentucky ; our 
friends in Virginia are all well. My dear husband is overpowered with business, but 
is in good health. We had all the heads of departments here yesterday to dinner, with their wives. 
</p><p>
I will write you, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, every day that I can take up my pen, and am already 
prepared with a room, and every sisterly attention for your husband ; he will be 
here, I hope, in time to give his vote for war. However, I may be mistaken, and that dreaded epoch may be some distance off. 
</p><p>
Payne is in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> yet, and as much admired and respected as you could wish. 
He writes me that Mrs. Patterson and Mrs. Bonaparte are very kind to him, and 
he is invited out all the time. We intend to send him in a few months to Princeton. 
Kiss the sweet girls and boys for me, and sleep in peace, my dear sister ; Heaven will 
preserve you and yours as you trust in its great power. 
</p><p>
Ever your own
