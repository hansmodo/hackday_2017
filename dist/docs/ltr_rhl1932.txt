DEAR SIR The gentlemen of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=westmoreland" rel="city">WESTMORELAND</a>, desire me to return their hearty thanks to you, for your very genteel present of Lord Chatham's picture. It arrived 
in fine order, and is very much admired. They propose to place it in the court house, thinking the assembly may furnish themselves, with his lordship's picture. 
</p><p>
The gentlemen are not without hopes, that they may yet obtain Lord Camden's portrait, as they seem very 
unwilling to believe, that that great man can so apostatize from a virtuous cause, so ably and invincibly defended by himself, as to put it out, even, of his own 
power, to make the American so much, as doubtful Dr. Lee, my brother, can show you the proceedings of our last Assembly, by which, you may judge, how bright 
the flame of liberty burns here, and may surely convince a tyrannous administration, that honesty and equity 
alone, can secure the cordiality and affection of Virginia. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rhl" rel="me">RICHARD HENRY LEE</a>.
