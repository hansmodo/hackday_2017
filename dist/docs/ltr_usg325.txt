DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
I have been wanting to write you for some time and am not so
indifferent as you would make out. I wish you could be here for a day
or two to see what I have to go through from breakfast until twelve at
night, seven days in the week. I have now just got through with my
mail for to-night, and as it is not yet twelve and the mail does not
close until that time, I will devote the remainder of the time in
penning you a few lines. I have no war news to communicate, however.
</p><p>
Julia and the children have returned from St. Louis. They will not
make you the promised visit whilst I remain here.
</p><p>
Captain Foley arrived to-day and I showed him all the attention I
could but I regret to say it was not much. He will excuse it however.
</p><p>
I am sorry you did not come with him. I believe I should have allowed
the children to go back with you.
</p><p>
I have learned through private sources that an attack has been made
upon Fort Jackson, Louisiana, and that the place has been taken. That
is to say such is the report in Columbus, but I do not know whether to
credit the report. Something has taken place to call off many of their
troops. They still have a much larger force than I have.
</p><p>
Whilst I am writing several Galena gentlemen are in talking. They will
remain until the office closes so you must excuse a disconnected
letter.
</p><p>
I do not now see that the probabilities are so strong that I will
likely be removed. A full disposition seems to have been made of all
my seniors.
</p><p>
Father seems to be very much inclined to criticise all our generals.
It may have been a little inexcusable in General Buell not to allow
troops to stop for a few hours when near their homes. But he should
recollect that General Buell was not on the spot to see the
circumstances fully, and he does not know what necessity may have
existed to have got the troops through by a certain time.
</p><p>
At your request I send a small batch from my cranium. I doubt whether
it is big enough for the purpose you want it.
</p><p>
If you will come out here you might spend a few weeks pleasantly and I
hope you will not lose such an opportunity as has just occurred.
</p><p>
I will close this. My love to all at home.
</p>
ULYS.
