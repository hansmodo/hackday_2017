GENTLEMEN OF THE FIRST AND SECOND VIRGINIA REGIMENTS: 
</p><p>
Your address does me the highest honour. Be pleased to accept my most cordial thanks for your favourable and kind sentiments of my principles and conduct. 
The high appointment to which my fellow-citizens have called me, was indeed, unmerited, unsolicited. I am therefore under increased obligations to promote the safety, 
dignity, and happiness of the commonwealth. 
</p><p>
While the civil powers are employed in establishing a system of government, liberal, equitable, in every part of which the genius of equal liberty 
breathes her blessed influence, to you is assigned the glorious task of saving, by your valour, all that is dear to Mankind. Go on, gentlemen, to finish the 
great work you have so nobly and successfully begun. Convince the tyrants again, that they shall bleed, that America will bleed to her last drop, ere 
their wicked schemes find success. 
</p><p>
The remembrance of my former connexion with you shall ever be dear to me. I honour your profession, I revere that patriot virtue, which, in your 
conduct, hath produced cheerful obedience, exemplary courage, and contempt of hardship and danger. Be assured, gentlemen, I shall feel the highest pleasure 
in embracing every opportunity to contribute to your happiness and welfare ; and I trust the day will come when I shall make one of those 
that will hail you among the triumphant deliverers of America. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
