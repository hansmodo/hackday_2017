Mr. Humphrey a regular Miner arrived, and left for Columa with Wimmer & Marshall. Entered with them in Mining, furnished Indians, teams and provisions to this Company, and as I was loosing instead making something, I left this Company as a Partner. Some of the Neighbors, while the Mormons left, became likewise the Goldfever and went to the Mountains prospecting and soon afterwards moved up to digg and wash Gold, and some of them with great success.
