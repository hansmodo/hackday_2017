GENERAL R. E. LEE
</p><p>
Commanding Confederate States Army : 
</p><p>
GENERAL, The results of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army 
of Northern Virginia in this struggle. I feel that it is so, and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any 
further effusion of blood by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate army known as the Army of Northern Virginia. 
</p><p>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
U. S. GRANT, 
</p><p>
Lieutenant- General, Commanding Armies of the United States.
