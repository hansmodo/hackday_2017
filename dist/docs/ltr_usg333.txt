<i>biograper's note</i><p>[Walnut Hills is a little north of Vicksburg. The position of
Vicksburg on high bluffs overlooking the river was inaccessible. After
five months of exposure and labor Grant at last attained his
preliminary object, getting his troops to the rear of the city. During
this time he would not communicate his plans to the public--this
movement to a point below Vicksburg from which to operate. The North
was much discouraged over the situation; voluntary enlistment ceased.
It was important to gain a decisive victory. In January, he assumed
command himself of the expedition. The siege lasted from May 10th to
July 4th. Johnston was the commander-in-chief of the Confederate
forces and was east of the troops besieging Vicksburg. Pemberton was
in command at Vicksburg.]</p><hr>

DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
I have received several letters from Mary and yourself, but as I have
to deal with nineteen-twentieths of those received, have neglected to
answer them.
</p><p>
All I can say is that I am well. I have the enemy closely hemmed in
all round. My position is naturally strong and fortified against an
attack from outside. I have been so strongly reinforced that <a href="/results.php?tla=jpj" rel="adversary">Johnston</a>
will have to come with a mighty host to drive me away.--I do not look
upon the fall of <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a> as in the least doubtful. If, however, I
could have carried the place on the 22nd of last month, I could by
this time have made a campaign that would have made the State of
Mississippi almost safe for a solitary horseman to ride over. As it
is, the enemy have a large army in it, and the season has so far
advanced that water will be difficult to find for an army marching,
besides the dust and heat that must be encountered. The fall of
<a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a> now will only result in the opening of the Mississippi River
and demoralization of the enemy. I intended more from it. I did my
best, however, and looking back can see no blunder committed.
</p>
ULYSSES.
