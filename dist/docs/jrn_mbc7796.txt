<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='21'>21st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. They say Governor Magrath has absconded, and that the Yankees have said, " If you have no visible 
governor, we will send you one. " If we had one and they found him, they would clap him in prison instanter.

The negroes have flocked to the Yankee squad which has recently come, but they were snubbed, the rampant freedmen. " Stay where you are," say the Yanks. " We have nothing for you." And they sadly " peruse " their way. 
Now that they have picked up that word " peruse," they use it in season and out. When we met Mrs. Preston's 
William we asked, Where are you going ? " " Perusing my way to Columbia," he answered.

When the Yanks said they had no rations for idle negroes, John Walker answered mildly, " This is not at all 
what we expected." The colored women, dressed in their gaudiest array, carried bouquets to the Yankees, making 
the day a jubilee. But in this house there is not the slightest change. Every negro has known for months that he or she 
was free, but I do not see one particle of change in their manner. They are, perhaps, more circumspect, polite, and 
quiet, but that is all. Otherwise all goes on in antebellum statu quo. Every day I expect to miss some familiar face, 
but so far have been disappointed.

Mrs. Huger we found at the hotel here, and we brought her to Bloomsbury. She told us that Jeff Davis was traveling leisurely with his wife twelve miles a day, utterly careless whether he were taken prisoner or not, and that General Hampton had been paroled.

Fighting Dick Anderson and Stephen Elliott, of Fort Sumter memory, are quite ready to pray for Andy Johnson, 
and to submit to the powers that be. Not so our belligerent clergy. "Pray for people when I wish they were dead ?" 
cries Rev. Mr. Trapier. "No, never ! I will pray for <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>President Davis</a> till I die. I will do it to my last gasp. My chief 
is a prisoner, but I am proud of him still. He is a spectacle to gods and men. He will bear himself as a soldier, a patriot, a statesman, a Christian gentleman. He is the martyr of our cause." And I replied with my tears. 
</p><p>
" Look here : taken in woman's clothes ? asked Mr. Trapier. Kubbish, stuff, and nonsense. If Jeff Davis has 
not the pluck of a true man, then there is no courage left on this earth. If he does not die game, I give it up. Some 
thing, you see, was due to <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> and the Scotch cap that he hid his ugly face with, in that express car, when he 
rushed through Baltimore in the night. It is that escapade of their man <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> that set them on making up the woman's clothes story about Jeff Davis."

Mrs. W. drove up. She, too, is off for New York, to sell four hundred bales of cotton and a square, or something, 
which pays tremendously in the Central Park region, and to capture and bring home her belle fille, who remained 
North during the war. She knocked at my door. The day was barely dawning. I was in bed, and as I sprang up, 
discovered that my old Confederate night-gown had to be managed, it was so full of rents. I am afraid I gave undue 
attention to the sad condition of my gown, but could no where see a shawl to drape my figure.

She was very kind. In case my husband was arrested and needed funds, she offered me some " British securities " and bonds. We were very grateful, but we did not accept the loan of money, which would have been 
almost the same as a gift, so slim was our chance of repaying it. But it was a generous thought on her part ; I own that.

Went to our plantation, the Hermitage, yesterday. Saw no change; not a soul was absent from his or her post. I 
said, " Good colored folks, when are you going to kick off the traces and be free ? In their furious, emotional way, 
they swore devotion to us all to their dying day. Just the same, the minute they see an opening to better themselves 
they will move on. William, my husband's foster-brother, came up. " Well, William, what do you want ? asked my husband. " Only to look at you, marster; it does me good."
