Dear Brother: I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> Wednesday, Nov. 26, 
with 26 regiments of Infantry, ten field batteries and 
one Cavalry regiment. In all about 18,000 men to cooperate with Grant in attacking the enemy, then lying 
on the south bank of the Tallahatchee, 18 miles south 
of Holly Springs arid about 70 from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a>. Their 
strength is estimated from about 40,000 to 50,000 men, 
under Pemberton, Price, Van Dorn and others. Grant 
allowed me 4 days to reach Tchullahoma. In 3 days 
I was near Tallahoosee, when I communicated with him, 
and next day reached Tchullahoma, he advancing to 
Waterford. Coincident with our movement, an expedition was planned to move from Helena under Gen. 
Harvey, to attack or threaten Grenada, about 60 miles 
to the rear of the position of the enemy. On approaching the Tallahatchee we found it abandoned, although 
its fords, ferries, and crossing places had been well 
fortified and obstructed. Grant moved on the main road 
south from Holly Springs, and I on his right about 10 
miles, reaching the river at an old town called Wyatt. 
I had brought boats with me from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a>, with which 
we soon crossed our infantry and cavalry regiments, 
swimming the horses, and found two long lines of intrenchments about 2 miles back from the river, where 
there is a kind of neck. These were, however, completely 
abandoned. Sending the Cavalry ahead to co-operate 
with Grant, then pressing the rear of the retreating 
forces, deliberately set to work, built a good bridge, and 
the day before yesterday I rode forward to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=oxford" rel="city">Oxford</a>, 
where I found Grant and received his further orders to 
cross and occupy <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=college hill" rel="city">College Hill</a>, 4 miles to his right.

I have one division, Dunn's, here, and 2 on Hurricane 
Creek, to my rear. We have had two days' hard rain 
and snow, making the roads very bad. Indeed, since 
the building of the railroad, the mud roads, leading north 
and south are disused and are washed very badly, the 
country resembling that about Somerset, Ohio. We find 
plenty of corn, fodder, cattle, hogs, sheep, &c., so that 
our enemies have not been starving. Salt is scarce, but 
they are manufacturing it largely on the coast, and at 
well about Mobile. By our movement, we have for 
the time being cleared North Mississippi. I doubt if 
we shall proceed much further on this line, as operations 
should now proceed against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> and Yazoo. I 
hear nothing from Virginia or Kentucky. We are far 
ahead of them, and they should push up. . . . 
(l suppose you hear little of me. I allow no reporters 
about. My official reports go to the proper office, and 
thus the enemy shall learn nothing of my forces, plans or 
purposes, through an egotistical and corrupt press. . . .j

Yours affectionately,
