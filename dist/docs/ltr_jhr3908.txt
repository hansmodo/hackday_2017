SIR: 
</p><p>
I desire that you will immediately embody one-third of your regiment 
and procure as many volunteers as you can from it, properly armed and 
prepared to proceed, and send a Field Officer with them to Charles 
Town, with the utmost despatch. 
</p><p>
I am in haste, sir, 
</p><p>
your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jhr" rel="me">J. RUTLEDGE</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Volunters serving as drafted militia shall have the same pay and allowance of salt, as these militia. Pray have the inclosed resolutions generally and speedily made known throughout your regiment.
