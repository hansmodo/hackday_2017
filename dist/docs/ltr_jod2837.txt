THERE is in the human breast, a social affection, which 
extends to our whole species, faintly indeed, but in 
some degree. The nation, kingdom or community 
to which we belong is embraced by it more vigorously. It is stronger still towards the province to 
which we "Belong, and in which we had our birth. It is stronger and stronger as we descend to the county, 
town, parish, neighbourhood and family, which we call 
our own. And here we find it often so powerful, as 
to become partial, to blind our eyes, to darken our 
understandings, and pervert our wills. 
</p><p>
It is to this infirmity in my own heart, that I must 
perhaps attribute that local attachment, that partial 
fondness, that overweening prejudice in favor of New 
England, which I feel very often, and which, I fear, 
sometimes leads me to expose myself to just ridicule. 
</p><p>
New England has, in many respects, the advantage 
of every other colony in America, and, indeed, of 
every other part of the world that I know any thing 
of.
</p><p>
1. The people are purer English blood ; less mixed 
with Scotch, Irish, Dutch, French, Danish, Swedish, 
&c., than any other ; and descended from English 
men too, who left Europe in purer times than the 
present, and less tainted with corruption than those 
they left behind them. 
</p><p>
2. The institutions in New England for the support 
of religion, morals and decency exceed any other ; 
obliging every parish to have a minister, and every 
person to go to meeting, &c. 
</p><p>
3. The public institutions in New England for the 
education of youth, supporting colleges at the pub 
lic expense, and obliging towns to maintain grammar 
schools, are not equalled, and never were, in any part 
of the world. 
</p><p>
4. The division of our territory, that is, our coun 
ties, into townships ; empowering towns to assemble, 
</p><p>
choose officers, make laws, mend roads and twenty 
other things, gives every man an opportunity of show 
ing and improving that education, which he received 
at college or at school, and makes knowledge and 
dexterity at public business common. 
</p><p>
5. Our law for the distribution of intestate estates 
occasions a frequent division of landed property and 
prevents monopolies of hind. 
</p><p>
But in opposition to these we have labored under many disadvantages. The exorbitant prerogative 
of our Governors, &c., which would have overborne our liberties, if it had not been opposed by the five preceding particulars.
