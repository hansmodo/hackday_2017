LOVING SON : I receiv'd yours of Sept. i, and am rejoic'd 
to hear you are all well. Your good Mother and Sisters were 
so about a Fortnight ago, when I heard from them. The Bill 
you sent me for 60, Whinney on Smith, Wright, & Grey, 
being good, I return your Note enclos'd and cancel'd. There 
remains Five Guineas unpaid, which you had of me just on 
going away, so I suppose you forgot it. Send it in a Venture 
for Ben to Jamaica. By the way, it has been reported here 
that some Years since a very long Building in that Island, 
which had a Rod or Conductor at each End, was nevertheless 
struck by Lightning in the middle and much damaged. Did 
you hear of such a Thing while you was there ? If so pray 
enquire and learn the Particulars from thence, what kind of 
Rods, how plac'd, how high above the Roof, how deep in the 
Ground, and other material Circumstances with regard to the 
Building and the Damage. If you heard of no such Event 
while you was there, I suppose the Story is not true. But a 
Mr. Smith, who was there in some Business, and now here a 
Merchant, I think, relates it as what he heard spoken of 
when there.

I am surprised to hear that the Dutchman I assisted with 
25 Guineas turned out a Rogue; and that Sheets has paid 
nothing of what I furnished him when here. I am afraid 
I do not grow wiser as I grow older. Pray let me know 
whether the Dutch printer, Armbruster, has paid anything, 
or is solvable or not. And also how the Affair stands 
of the Mortgage I had on my friend Maugridge's Plantation, no intelligible Information has yet been given me 
of it. 
</p><p>
We are moving to another House in the same [mutilated] 
leaving this to Mr. Hewson. As soon as I am settled in my 
new Apartments I shall examine Parker's Acc ts and write 
to you on them.

You hope I was not a Sufferer in the late general Wreck 
of Credit here. My two Banking-Houses, Browns & Collinson, and Smith, Wright & Grey, stood firm, and they were the 
only People here in Debt to me, so I lost nothing by the Failure 
of others ; and being out of Debt myself, my Credit could not 
be shaken by any Run upon me ; out of Debt, as the Proverb 
says, was being out of Danger. But I have since hazarded 
a little in using my Credit with the Bank to support that of 
a Friend as far as 5,000, for which I am secured by Bills 
of the Bank of Douglas, Heron, & Co., accepted by a good 
House here; and therefore I call it only hazarding a little, 
tho' the Sum is large enough to ruin me if I were to lose it. 
Our Friends, the Alexanders, went on again immediately, 
being supported by great Houses here and thro' them by the 
Bank, their Bottom being manifestly very great and good, 
tho' they had embarrassed themselves by assisting the Adams's 
and others. 
</p><p>
The Affair of the Grant is in good Train, and we expect 
it to be compleated soon after the Boards meet; if no new 
Difficulties start up unexpected. 
My Love to Sally and the Boy. 
</p><p>
I am your affectionate Father.

B. FRANKLIN.
