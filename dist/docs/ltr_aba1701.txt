</p><p>
MY DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
DOES not my friend think me a stupid girl, when she has kindly offered to correspond with me, that I should be so senseless as not to accept the offer? Senseless and stupid I would confess myself, and that to the greatest degree, if I did not foresee the 
many advantages I shall receive from corresponding with a lady of your known prudence and under standing. 
</p><p>
I gratefully accept your offer ; although I may be charged with vanity in pretending to entertain you with my scrawls ; yet I know your generosity is that, like a kind parent, you will bury in oblivion &11 my imperfections. I do not aim at entertaining. 
I write merely for the instruction and edification which I shall receive, provided you honor me with your correspondence. 
</p><p>
Your letter I received, and, believe me, it has not been through forgetfulness, that I have not before 
this time returned you my sincere thanks for the kind assurance you then gave me of continued friendship. 
You have, I hope, pardoned my suspicions ; they arose from love. What persons in their right senses 
would calmly, and without repining or even inquiring into the cause, submit to lose their greatest temporal 
good and happiness? for thus the divine, Dr. Young, looks upon a true friend, when he says, 
</p><p>
" A friend is worth all hazards we can run. 
Poor is the friendless master of a world ; 
A world in purchase for a friend is gain." 
</p><p>
Who, that has once been favored with your friend ship, can be satisfied with the least diminution of it? 
Not those who value it according to its worth. 
</p><p>
You have, like king Ahasuerus, held forth, though not a golden sceptre, yet one more valuable, the 
sceptre of friendship, if I may so call it. Likea Esther, I would draw nigh and touch it. Will you 
proceed and say, " What wilt thou? " and " What 
is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the 
half of my heart." Why, no. I think I will not 
have so dangerous a present, lest your good man 
should find it out and challenge me ; but, if you please, I have a place in one corner of it, a place 
well guarded and fortified, or still I shall fear being 
jostled out by him. Now do not deny my request 
on purpose to make me feel the weight of your 
observation, " that we are often disappointed when 
we set our minds upon that which is to yield us 
great happiness." I know it too well already. Daily 
experience teaches me that truth. 
</p><p>
And now let me ask you, my friend, whether you 
do not think, that many of our disappointments and 
much of our unhappiness arise from our forming 
false notions of things and persons. We strangely 
impose upon ourselves ; we create a fairy land of 
happiness. Fancy is fruitful and promises fair, but, 
like the dog in the fable, we catch at a shadow, and 
when we find the disappointment, we are vexed, not 
with ourselves, who are really the impostors, but with 
the poor, innocent thing or person of whom we have 
formed such strange ideas. When this is the case, 
I believe we always find, that we have enjoyed more 
pleasure in the anticipation than in the real enjoyment of our wishes. 
</p><p>
Dr. Young says, " Our wishes give us not our 
wishes." Some disappointments are, indeed, more 
grievous than others. Since they are our lot, let us 
bear them with patience. That person, that cannot 
bear a disappointment, must not live in a world so 
changeable as this, and t'is wise it should be so ; for, 
were we to enjoy a continual prosperity, we should 
be too firmly attached to the world ever to think of 
quitting it, and there would be room to fear, that we should be so far intoxicated with prosperity as to 
swim smoothly from joy to joy, along life's short current, wholly unmindful of the vast ocean, Eternity. 
</p><p>
If I did not know that it would be adding to the 
length of my letter, I might make some excuse for 
it ; but that and another reason will hinder me. 
</p><p>
You bid me tell one of my sparks (I think that 
was the word) to bring me to see you. Why ! I 
believe you think they are as plenty as herrings, 
when, alas ! there is as great a scarcity of them as 
there is of justice, honesty, prudence, and many 
other virtues. I've no pretensions to one. Wealth, 
wealth is the only thing that is looked after now. 
It is said Plato thought, if Virtue would appear to 
the world, all mankind would be enamoured with 
her, but now interest governs the world and men 
neglect the golden mean. 
</p><p>
But, to be sober, I should really rejoice to come 
and see you, but if I wait till I get a (what did you 
call em ?) I fear you'll be blind with age. 
</p><p>
I can say, in the length of this epistle, I've made 
the golden rule mine. Pray, my friend, do not let it 
be long before you write to your ever affectionate 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. My regards to your good man. I've no 
acquaintance with him, but if you love him, I do, 
and should be glad to see him.
