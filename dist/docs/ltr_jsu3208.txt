DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am sorry to inform your Excellency, that I am 
under the painful necessity of leaving a service to 
which I am, by principle and interest, attached ; and, 
among the variety of mortifications I must suffer in 
quitting it, that of being deprived the pleasure of 
serving under your Excellency, stands among the 
foremost. My health is too much impaired to be re 
covered but by a total release from business ; and, 
though the physicians give me encouragement that 
this will restore me, I am myself convinced of the 
contrary, and fear that I must content myself with 
enjoying the reflection of having used my utmost to 
serve my country, as the only thing I shall receive 
in exchange for a constitution sacrificed in endeavouring to promote its interest. 
</p><p>
Should there be a probability of <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>'s 
arrival, I would willingly wait, to give the little assistance in my power to extirpate the enemies of 
this country ; but, should this not be likely to happen, and the season be too far advanced, I must 
beg your Excellency's leave to retire as soon as 
possible, that I may take every measure in my 
power to restore my health in some degree, or at 
least to live in such a manner as will not tend to 
put it beyond a possibility of being restored, which a longer continuance in the service undoubtedly will. 
I have the honor to r be, most respectfully, my dear General, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
