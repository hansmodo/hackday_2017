SIR: 
</p><p>
I am directed by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Major-General Greene</a> to inform you, that the 
quarter part of the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> have arrived at Charlestown. 
</p><p>
This reinforcement places the enemy in a situation to act offensively. 
The General begs you will order the troops under your command to 
Bacon Bridge with as much expedition as possible, as the advanced 
position of the army exposes it to be attacked by the enemy whenever 
they may think proper. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> is fully persuaded that no time 
will be lost in taking the position at the bridge. I have the honor to 
be, with much respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jbu" rel="me">J. BURNET</a>, Aide-de-Camp,
