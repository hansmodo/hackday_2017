TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 18 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, January 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
In the meantime some feeble hopes of relief are still entertained from the event of their negotiations at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. It 
is very questionable whether the authority of their Commissioners extends to the terms which it may be expected will 
be required, and which it should seem the Convention are 
now in a situation to dictate. They seem here to have made 
up their minds for an abandonment of the British alliance, 
and there will be probably no difficulty in that particular. 
But whether they are yet prepared to substitute the French 
alliance in its stead, and to go to war with those who are now 
defending them ; whether this measure will not be required 
as an indispensable condition to the accommodation, remains 
a problem still to be solved. There is indeed one uncertainty more which is really the greatest anxiety of the Court 
party, though they do not mention it. 
</p><p>
They are fearful that conditions specially unfavorable to 
the authority of the House of Orange will be required, conditions to which they are determined not to consent, because 
it would only confine to them the ruin, which at the worst 
they suppose will be general, and this is a species of devotion to which they are not inclined. 
</p><p>
In the meantime the business of which I wrote you in 
my No. 1 is still transacting. The two persons l I therein 
mentioned were at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> before the Commissioners Brantzen 
and Repelaer. They obtained passports, their errands being 
known, and those who sent them yet hope their success. 
</p><p>
It may be concluded from these circumstances that the 
destiny of this country is now in the hands of the French 
Convention. With a public commission in behalf of the 
present ruling power, and a secret one treating for the Patriots, 
they may chuse according to their ideas of their own interest, 
and close with those who offer the best terms. 
</p><p>
In considering that the real interest of France must be 
effectually to detach this Republic from the alliance with 
Britain, it cannot escape reflection that her strongest security will consist in a Revolution, at least partial, in the 
government. 
</p><p>
The negotiation of the moment is avowedly the effect of 
necessity, and it is not even pretended by those who conduct 
it that it is accompanied with a sincere desire of returning 
friendship. To the whole party France is an object of detestation and Britain of reverence, which no generosity 
can remove, which no violence and ill treatment can cancel. 
This truth cannot be more forcibly demonstrated than by 
the temper which evidently prevails. For while the moment 
of impending ruin extorts a cry for mercy, the determination 
to repay it with ingratitude is not denied, and cannot be 
</p><p>
From the delays which were thrown in the way of the Commissioners on their route to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, and the absolute refusal 
of an armistice, nothing auspicious to the government which employs them can be drawn. The partizans of the Court 
therefore fear much for the event. But they are not with out hopes arising from another source. They flatter them 
selves that the moderate party, which still retains the ascendancy in the National Convention, are disposed to tread 
back the steps of their own Revolution further than they yet 
venture to avow; that the day of French Republicanism is 
really past ; that the night of their former government is 
rapidly returning, and that the principles of counter revolution will operate efficaciously, though in secret, to save the 
existing Government of this country from ruin. . . .
