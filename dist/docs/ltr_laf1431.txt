<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Dear General</a>,--I cannot let go my guide without taking this opportunity
of writing to your excellency, though I have not yet public business to
speak of. I go on very slowly; sometimes drenched by rain, sometimes
covered by snow, and not entertaining many handsome thoughts about the
projected incursion into Canada; if successes were to be had, it would
surprise me in a most agreeable manner by that very reason that I don't
expect any shining ones. Lake Champlain is too cold for producing the
least bit of laurel, and if I am not starved I shall be as proud as if
I had gained three battles.

Mr. Duer had given to me a rendezvous at a tavern, but nobody was to be
found there. I fancy that he will be with Mr. Conway sooner than he has
told me; they will perhaps conquer Canada before my arrival, and I
expect to meet them at the governor's house in Quebec.
</p><p>
Could I believe, for one single instant, that this pompous command _of
a northern army_ will let your excellency forget a little us absent
friends, then, I would send the project to the place it comes from. But
I dare hope that you will remember me sometimes. I wish you, very
heartily, the greatest public and private happiness and successes. It
is a very melancholy idea for me that I cannot follow your fortunes as
near your person as I could wish; but my heart will take, very
sincerely, its part of everything which can happen to you, and I am
already thinking of the agreeable moment when I may come down to assure
your excellency of the most tender affection and highest respect. I
have the honour to be, &c.
</p>
