BERKLEY COUNTY, August ye 11th <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>

Sir 
</p><p>
You will do me the justice to acknowledge that at the time I was taught to think (I am sure without foundation) that you were one of the 
most active in my prosecution I gave it as my opinion that you were a brave Officer and honest Man You must likewise recollect that when you 
sent me a certain Message at Elizabeth Town I told you that if I was appointed to a command, and had my choice of Brigadiers, you should be 
one of my first election I hope therefore that what I am going to say you will not consider as paying my court in this your hour of glory, for 
as it is at least my present intention to leave this 
Continent, where I have been so scurvily and ungratefully treated, I can have no interest in paying my court to any Individual What I shall say therefore is dictated by the genuine feelings 
of my heart I do most sincerely declare that your action on the assault of Stony Point is not only the most brilliant, in my opinion, through 
the whole course of this War on either side, but that it is one of the most brilliant I am acquainted with in history Upon my soul, the 
assault of Sweidnitz by Marshal Laudon I think inferior to it I wish you therefore most sincerely joy of the laurels you have deservedly 
acquird, and that you may long live to wear and if you have leisure (as I am curious in these details) to inform me of the particular order of 
your disposition you will much oblige one who is without flattery with respect and no small admiration Your most obedt humble Servt
