My distinguished and appreciable friend
</p><p>
The recommendation you have made over Don Angel
Cabrera has been worthy of all possible esteem from
the best of friendships. In that case, everything has been placed so that
it will be useful to his Country, and give to said Cabrera every possible honor.
It has reached us at the exact time in which we are in the line of fire
of the enemies, who have been humiliated and battered by the brave men
under my command. You will see the brilliant successes that made the
action interesting detailed in the attached copy.
</p><p>
I am without more time by force of my duties
but you have my most cordial feelings, your dear and J. Q. B. S. M.
