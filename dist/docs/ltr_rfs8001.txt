Sir : I am here, anxious to know what prospect there is of your being able to recruit my thousand men for a visit to Mexico. 
</p><p>
Let me know as soon as possible. Many serious arrangements will have to be made, all requiring more or less time, which, you know, in war is more precious than " rubies." 
</p><p>
Your faithful friend and obedient servant,
