Dear Christman:--Here in the Record office, we have hardly recovered from the late political campaign. It made us a great deal of extra work. The smoke of battle is gradually clearing away and we find ourselves licked like thunder throughout the State. In Chester County we did the clean thing and proved ourselves " sound corn to the tassel." The whole county ticket has been
elected by large majorities. Our mutual friend, Captain Apple, was not elected County Treasurer. It was a " poor season for Apples." This device was on some of the transparencies in the torch-light processions before the election.

Mr. Evans is elected Senator by a large majority, and will again go to Harrisburg. His friends worked hard to keep up his vote.
</p><p>
We have a line of telegraph to West Chester and feel quite proud of the construction. The office is at Mrs. Hunter's.
</p><p>
On Wednesday we will have the Circus. This will bring the negroes to town. We have also a course of lectures at the Methodist Church, which I very much enjoy. We boys have formed a debating society, such as we used to have in your time.
</p><p>
The Gideons are all true to their ancient faith. I acknowledge that I wait upon Miss Sallie Cope pretty regularly. She is a very pleasant girl, fine company and good pastime. But I am not married yet.
</p><p>
Write soon and full.
</p><p>
Your friend,
</p><p>
