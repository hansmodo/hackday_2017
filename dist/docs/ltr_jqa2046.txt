TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 9 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, November 24th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
I have made inquiry of several merchants concerned in 
the American trade, whether there was any ground of com 
plaint arising from the want of execution attending any 
article of our treaty of commerce with their High Mightinesses? The general answer has been, that many embarrassments, burthens and discouragements have been 
laid upon our trade, and that there is real cause of complaint as to the fulfillment of the stipulations in the Treaty. 
But in endeavoring to ascertain particulars I have hitherto been unsuccessful. 
</p><p>
The merchants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> are remarkably averse from communication relative to their trade. They are as evasive 
in answering any questions either as to its principles or its details as if they were all ministers of State, and although 
I have met with abundance of dissatisfaction with the oppression of our commerce, I have in vain requested and 
even solicited a particular statement of its grievances. It has been indeed promised from more than one quarter, and 
I am yet not without hopes of obtaining it, though I have hitherto been disappointed in my expectations. 
</p><p>
As far however as I have been able to procure information as to the foundation of the complaint it is upon two 
grounds. The one arising from the recent prohibition of sundry articles from exportation, and the other from the 
That of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1782">1782</a>. 
</p><p>
perception in some cases of heavier duties upon the American 
navigation than upon that of the most favored nation. 
With respect to the first they say, it is a direct violation of 
the article in the treaty upon the subject of contraband. 
I have never considered, however, that this article, which 
under different modifications is common to almost all 
treaties of commerce, implied a surrender of the contracting 
parties of their right to prohibit in cases of emergency the 
exportation of articles which become of the first necessity 
for their own use. I have however requested a list of the 
articles which have lately been thus prohibited ; but the 
gentlemen who are the most discontented with the prohibition, and who at first promised me such a list, have since 
excused themselves from it, observing that at this critical 
moment, while the government itself is in so dangerous and 
precarious a situation, they think it would be most advisable to postpone any representations upon this point, and 
wait for more quiet and peaceable times. The only articles 
I have heard mentioned in conversation are gunpowder and 
alum. I have been promised also a copy of a petition 
lately presented by the merchants concerned in our trade 
to the States General upon this subject. Perhaps some 
further information will result from the perusal of that. 
At present I can only say in general terms that the exportation of several articles of merchandise has lately been prohibited from hence, that American vessels have not been 
excepted from the effect of this prohibition, and that the merchants in our trade complain of it as a grievance. 
</p><p>
The difference between the duties to which our commerce and that of the most favored nation are severally subject, 
appears to me more liable to a demand on our part for the enjoyment of the stipulation contained in the treaty. It is 
known to you, Sir, that for many years there has been in this country a chartered West India Company. They had 
a certain jurisdiction by virtue of which all the duties laid upon the commerce with the West Indies were made payable 
to them instead of the Admiralty, and in many instances there is a difference between the impositions upon the same 
articles imported under the two different administrations. Previous to our Revolution the trade with North America 
was comprehended within the jurisdiction of the West India Company, which at that time was more favorable 
to the commerce than if it had been within that of the Admiralty. At the expiration of the Company's charter a 
few years since, they made a bankruptcy, and surrendered 
all their affairs into the hands of a committee of the States 
General, to whom all their rights and powers are thus 
transferred. The commerce of the United States, however, 
continues upon the same footing on which it stood while 
they were British colonies, and by its connection with the 
privileges of the West India Company is subjected to much 
heavier impositions than it would be at the Admiralty, 
especially upon the article of spices. For since the participation we have obtained in the carrying trade, in consequence 
of our own and the French Revolutions, our commerce with 
this country has become a very different thing from what it 
was in the days of our subjection, and its dependence upon 
the charter of the West India Company, which was then 
much to its advantage, is now converted into a heavy burthen 
by exposing it to the charges of a greater tax than is levied 
upon the navigation of other nations in the carriage of the 
same articles. 
</p><p>
The merchants in our trade consider this as altogether inconsistent with the article of the treaty which places us 
upon the level of the most favored nation. I think so too, 
unless we have submitted to it by express agreement, which 
is said by one gentleman with whom I have conversed upon 
the subject to be the case. I have not yet got from England the books which I took from America, and have not 
an opportunity of consulting the treaties at present. I have 
thought it my duty to acquaint you at any rate with the 
circumstances, and shall equally forward any further in 
formation as it shall come to my own knowledge.

November 2$th. The British Parliament is prorogued 
again till the thirty-first of December, and the funds rose 
in consequence of that measure two or three per cent. The 
prorogation is received as a portent of negotiations for a 
general peace. On the other hand the National Convention 
have appointed two commissioners to be employed upon 
business under the direction of the Committee of Public 
Safety, but secret even to the Convention itself. These 
facts combined with the capture of Nimeguen and Maestricht, the subsequent inaction of the armies on both sides, 
and Mr. FageFs mission to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, all strengthen the expectation of peace. 
</p><p>
The Insurrection of Poland appears once more to be 
subdued. After a succession of severe defeats and the 
capture of Kosciuszko x and his successor in command, 
Warsaw has capitulated. The public sentiment even in 
England and this country was generally favorable to the 
cause of the Poles, but the destiny of that unhappy people 
must be completed. 
</p><p>
An occurrence of a different complexion is that La Fayette has made his escape from prison, together with two companions one of whom however was retaken. This intelligence 
comes from very good authority by a letter from Breslau to a gentleman in this city. 
</p><p>
A cockade with the word Egalite marked upon it is circulated among the patriots in this city, who do not yet
venture however to wear it. This is a symptom of an under standing with the invading nation and of a concert among 
themselves in the party here which, though trivial in itself, is more strongly marked than any other that has reached 
me. I have the honor, etc.
