Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will, I am persuaded, readily admit the force of this sentiment, that though it is the 
duty of a good citizen to devote his services to the 
public, when it has occasion for them, he cannot, 
with propriety or delicacy to himself, obtrude them, 
when it either has, or appears to have, none. The 
difficulties I experienced last campaign in obtaining a command, will not suffer me to make any further 
application on that head. 
</p><p>
As I have many reasons to consider my being employed hereafter in a precarious light, the bare possibility of rendering an equivalent will not justify to 
my scruples the receiving any future emoluments 
from my commission. I therefore renounce, from this 
time, all claim to the compensations attached to my 
military station during the war, or after it. But I 
have motives which will not permit me to resolve on 
a total resignation. I sincerely hope a prosperous 
train of affairs may continue to make it no inconvenience to decline the services of persons whose zeal, 
in worse times, was found not altogether useless; but, 
as the most promising appearances are often reversed 
by unforeseen disasters, and as unfortunate events 
may again make the same zeal of some value, I am 
unwilling to put it out of my power to renew my 
exertions in the common cause in the line in which 
I have hitherto acted. I shall accordingly retain my 
rank while I am permitted to do it, and take this 
opportunity to declare, that I shall be at all times 
[ready] to obey the call of the public, in any capacity, civil or military (consistent with what I owe to 
myself), in which there may be a prospect of my 
contributing to the final attainment of the object for 
which I embarked in the service. I have the honor 
to be, very respectfully. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
