My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Before I leave the borders of France, I wish once 
more to remind you of your absent friend, and to let 
you know that I am well, and just beginning my 
German march. I have been lately visiting some 
French towns, where I spoke a great deal about 
American trade, and fully answered the views I had 
the honor to communicate in a former letter. 
Now I am on my way to the Deux Fonts, where 
resides our friend, the future Elector of Bavaria ; to 
Cassel, where I shall see again the Hessian regiments ; to Berlin, where I am told Lord Cornwallis 
is also going. From there, I shall wait on the King of Prussia, on his grand manoeuvres in Silesia ; visit 
Saxony ; see the Austrian camp in Bohemia ; pay 
my respects to the Emperor at Vienna ; return to 
Berlin, where grand manoeuvres are to take place at 
the end of September ; and, after I have on my 
way examined all the fields of battle, I shall return 
through Holland, and be again in Paris by the 
middle of October. 
</p><p>
This letter, my dear General, goes with our old 
friend <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague friend met'>Dr. Franklin</a>, who, I hope, will be received 
with that respect he so much deserves. It will be 
forwarded by his grandson, a very deserving young 
man, who wishes being introduced by me to you ; 
and I beg leave to recommend him to your attentions. He has been much employed in public ; got 
nothing by it; and, as the Doctor loves him better 
than any thing in the world, I think he ought to 
have the satisfaction to see him noticed by Congress. 
You will oblige me to let them know that I spoke 
to you my mind about it. 
</p><p>
You remember an idea, which I imparted to you 
three years ago. I am going to try it in the French 
colony of Cayenne, but will write more fully on the 
subject in my other letters. Nothing new now in 
the political world. War is far at a distance. Adieu, 
my beloved General. My most affectionate respects 
wait on Mrs. Washington. Remember me to the 
young ones, to my Aid George, to Mr. Lund, all our 
friends, and particularly to Mrs. Stuart. You know 
my heart, my dear General, and I need not add the assurances of the filial love, respect, and gratitude, 
I have the honor to be with, 
</p><p>
Your devoted friend, 
</p><p>

P. S. Gouvion is going with me, and has the honor to present his respects to you.
