SIR: 
</p><p>
I have information the enemy intends to make an attack on your 
post; you will order all the militia around you to your assistance. I 
am this moment in motion to reinforce you; you must make every 
defence possible until I arrive. A flag came here yesterday from the 
enemy on important business to both armies ; what, we have not yet 
learned. The officer which came says we shall very soon take one 
another by the hand in friendship. Some say there is a cessation of 
arms to take place, and that peace is actually on the carpet. Send per 
express the letters to Col. Baxter and Murphy. I hope you have the 
twenty-five stand of arms last ordered. 
</p><p>
I am, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
