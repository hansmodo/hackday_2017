GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I Wrote you the 12th instant, by express, since which I have purchased twenty-seven hundred bushels of wheat of Captain Cuthbert, at four shillings and sixpence, lawful money, payable in our paper bills of exchange, or an order on Congress, which shall be most agreeable to you. It is now sending to the mills. 
I have also received two hundred barges of flour from below, and expect a quantity more every moment; also three tons flour, 
which I had engaged before I left <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I make no doubt in a few days of collecting a magazine of flour sufficient for ten 
thousand men three months. A Commissary I sent out to purchase provisions, returned yesterday with twenty oxen. I have 
put the people to half an allowance of meat, and added to their bread. I make no doubt of supporting the army until provisions can come over the Lakes. 
</p><p>
Mr. Bonfield, a gentleman of character, arrived here yesterday ; 
he left Sully on Thursday last, Dechambeau on Saturday morning , where General Thomas was, with only nine hundred men ; 
Colonel Maxwell was at Jacques Cartier, but the number of men 
with him Mr. Bonfield could not tell. Mr. Bonfield saw a number of the regular officers and inhabitants of Quebec before he 
left Sully, who acquainted him that on Monday, the 6th instant, 
arrived at Quebec one sloop of war with fourteen guns, one 
twenty and one fifty-gun ship, from England, with two companies 
of the twenty-seventh regiment, and one company of marines, 
which were immediately landed, who, with the garrison that came 
out the same afternoon, made a body of one thousand men, commanded by General Carleton, from whom our people made a 
most precipitate retreat, without ever firing a gun. On the 8th, 
arrived a frigate of thirty guns, and a large India man, with five 
hundred men from Halifax, part of General Howe's army, the 
whole of which were on their passage for Quebec; and six thou 
sand Hessians, it is said, are on their way from England. If the 
latter is true, we shall doubtless have our hands full. Colonel 
A 1T en is come out in the ships from England, in irons (it is 
given out), to receive his trial for rebellion, and to be executed 
here.
</p><p>
I am sorry to inform you that all the carriages, except five, 
which came with the heavy cannon, were sent down, as they 
came over the Lakes, and fell into the enemy's hands. I have 
wrote to Colonel Hazen to put others in hand immediately, to 
replace them. We are making every possible disposition of defence in our power, and I make no doubt of securing this post 
in a few days. None of the enemy's ships have been able to 
ascend the Richelieu as yet. I make no doubt Mr. Price will 
take effectual measures to supply with provisions the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, St. John s, and the Cedars. Inclosed 
you have a letter to Mr. Evans, which fell into my hands, which contains a piece of intelligence worth noticing. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to know your sentiments in regard to inoculation, as early as possible. Will it not be best, considering the 
impossibility of preventing the spreading of the smallpox, to inoculate live hundred or a thousand men immediately, and send 
them to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, and as many more every five days, until the whole receive it, which will prevent our army being distressed 
hereafter; and I make no doubt we shall have more effective men, in four weeks, than by endeavouring to prevent the disorder 
spreading ; a period so near, that the enemy will not, with any considerable force, be able to reach this place by that time. 
</p><p>
A Quartermaster-General and Commissary are much wanted here. I have so much on hand, that I can hardly get one minute to write. You will be kind enough to excuse haste and incoherency, and believe me, with the greatest respect and esteem, Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
