My dear Nat
</p><p>
I send to the care of Miss Lettie Brunell a little dress I have long more than a year had wrapped up for one of your children It has gotten very yellow hanging by, but your good wife I know can make it as white as new, It had belonged to my little darling grandson & Charlotte made it with her own hands, I have been much interested in the account given me of your prinistine (?) visit into Maryland & am very sorry, we hoped seeing you I heard of your visit too to the President & hope it may produce some good effect Bishop Johnson was here & told me you had called to see him - wanted him to baptize your children He begins to look old though wonderfully active for one at his time (Page 2) of life, your cousin Robert is much better though still far from being perfectly restored I trust that he may --?-- in God = s own good time, yet at our age persons do not recover so rapidly & I have no hope of ever walking any better that I now do, - I enjoyed my visit to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mil" rel="child met">Fitzhugh</a> very much & my precious little grandson is very large for his months 17, & very handsome but altogether Bolling I hope they will come & see me this summer I should like to see you little ones who are they like? Do you remember Mrs Bonaparte Her husband died recently & a few hours afterwards her Mother at a very advanced age - My daughter Mary has gone out to St Louis to visit some of her friends there <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=agl" rel="child met">Agnes</a> & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mil" rel="child met">Mildred</a> are at home & with the --?-- join me in much love to you & your family Believe me
</p><p>
your affectionate cousin
