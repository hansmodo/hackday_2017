We are encamped on the main road to the Mariposa Diggings and hundreds of heavily packed mules and a few teams have been passing daily. Several of Mr. Cox's acquaintances who crossed the mountains with him are with us, and they have sent on a couple of their number to Mariposa for authentic information as to the state of things there. Mr. Cox has concluded to wait until they return when we shall
all move on together. We were right glad of this delay for we had to travel last Sunday. Some of our company started out this morning in pursuit of game. In one of the tents near our own several Methodist hymns were sung after dinner.

The weather is now warm and serene as in the middle of June at home, and it being near full moon, the evenings are mild and beautiful. The hills are covered with green verdure and the trees are sending forth their green shoots.

Mr. Cox and his friends who had been out hunting returned laden with the four quarters of a fat deer they had slain, and very kindly sent us a small piece. We had an excellent venison supper.
