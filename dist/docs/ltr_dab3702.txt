Dear General, 
</p><p>
By Captain Duplantier, who is just arrived from 
the Delaware toAvns, I am informed that the British 
at Detroit treat the French inhabitants with great 
severity, and that they wish for nothing more than 
the approach of a body of troops from this place. 
The Captain adds, that Colonel Clark, with a body of 
about one thousand men, has actually destroyed the 
Shawanese town at Chellacoffy, and was in pursuit 
of the Indians when the runner, who brought the 
account, came from thence. 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from the Reverend 
Mr. Heckewelder, and another from Captain John Killbuck, copies of which I take the liberty to inclose. Had I provisions, I should be happy to march 
against some of the hostile Indian towns. But, unfortunately, I have not more than a day's allowance 
of bread, and a very little beef, and I cannot yet see 
a fair prospect of obtaining adequate supplies until money can be furnished to pay for them. With the 
most exalted respect and esteem, &c. &c.,
