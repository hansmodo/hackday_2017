My Own Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--How shall I express the unexpected joy I felt when I received your kind letter accompanied with your daguerreotype. You could have sent nothing but yourself, that would have been half so acceptable. Although it was such a great pleasure to receive it, it made me feel rather sad to see how much thinner you are. But, oh, that awful California is enough to wear flesh and bones both away. Your hair being short, and you with moustache and whiskers, alter your appearance very much indeed. The eyes and mouth look very natural. The sleeves rolled up and the knife sticking in the belt, make me think that it is a hard country, for one of the very best of men to be in. But I am glad you sent it, for I love to look at it, changed as you are. I do hope the next surprise I meet with, will be the original himself. Do not, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, put off coming home later than next spring. Let it be sooner. Just to think, beside the glorious pleasure it will be to me, what a great pleasure it will be to your dear mother. That part of your letter which speaks of California being made as good as any new country, if men had their families there, I think is a mistake. Enough of the right kind of men will never go there to conquer the bad part of the community.

You say very little has been said with regard to the fulfillment of our engagement. We both, I think, understand each other. We have the greatest confidence in each other. We love each other. When you return and get settled, it will be an easy matter for us to fix a suitable and proper time. We will have plenty of
time then to talk over matters. I know my father and mother have no objections or they would have expressed them long before this.

Should you be successful where you are, I do not know how I should perform the household duties, but it would certainly be my greatest pleasure to try to do them well. As I am always assisting Mother in everything they would not be very new to me. I am very glad Dr. Gunn's family has arrived. It must be so much more comfortable and seem more like living to you.

There seems to be quite an excitement about Hossuth the Hungarian. He has arrived in New York. Great preparations are being made in Philadelphia to receive him. Miss Catherine Hays, the Irish Swan, is now singing in Philadelphia. She does not produce the excitement that Jenny Lind did.

I saw by the papers a few days ago an account of a young man who had left a comfortable home in the South. He had gone to California, been very successful in three years, and returned to Philadelphia. He was taken very sick on his passage and when he arrived in Philadelphia, had not a friend, and went to the nearest tavern which was an awfully low house in Water Street. He remained there two weeks when he was discovered by the police, almost in the agonies of death. He told the police he had been robbed of nearly all his money while there, but he still had two bags which he wished sent to his parents. One bag contained four hundred dollars and the other gold dust. He had better never heard tell of California.

We had a very heavy fall of snow which lasted nearly two weeks, then we had another snow storm, which made the best sleighing known for many years. West Chester was unusually lively. The cars were not
able to run from Saturday till Thursday, the snow having drifted so much. The mail was carried in a sleigh. Elizabeth Hodgson, and Poulson and Baker of the Record office, called in a two-horse sleigh for me, to go to Unionville. We had not gone very far before we had an upset in a snow-drift. That is what some people call the fun of going sleighing. Fortunately no one was hurt.
</p><p>
I hope you will write soon, telling me you have made up your mind to come home immediately.
</p><p>
Sincerely and devotedly,
</p><p>
