</p><p>
Sir: Herewith I have the honor to enclose a Requisition for supplies, 
made upon me by <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Capt. Fremont</a>, of United States Topographical Engineers, who is in command of a party of some fifty men, engaged upon an important Scientific Expedition. 
</p><p>
You will perceive that <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Capt. Fremont</a> states "his party to be nearly destitute, and under the unfriendly feeling of the Government of this country, 
in the existing position of affairs, he is unable to obtain supplies; and, in any case, only at very exorbitant prices." From the above-mentioned circumstances, I am induced to enclose this requisition, and respectfully request 
you to supply the same or such parts of it as you may be able to spare; being fully assured it will afford you great pleasure to render assistance to a 
different arm of the Service, engaged upon a laborious and dangerous expedition, exposed to every kind of danger and the greatest hardships men 
can endure; oftentimes living upon horseflesh, and at times without any provisions whatever. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Capt. Fremont</a> is also in want of funds for the purchase of animals, as, upon leaving for the United States, it will be necessary for him to purchase 
more horses, his present supply being travel-worn and almost unfit for the saddle. 
</p><p>
The exorbitant rate at which the Government Bills are exchanged induce me to beg you to supply <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Capt. Fremont</a> with fifteen hundred dollars 
($1500), if the same can be furnished without injury to your own particular service; for which he will give the necessary receipts or bills upon the 
Department. For these supplies and any others he may receive, <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Capt. Fremont</a> will make due settlement upon his arrival at Headquarters, Washton City. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Capt. Fremont</a> is now encamped on the Sacramento, at the mouth of the Feather River, where he awaits my return with such provisions as I may be able to obtain. 
</p><p>
Hoping you will be able to make the supply, I will only add that, in the event of the party receiving from you the assistance requested, you may be 
assured the same will not only be highly appreciated by the President and Departments, confer an obligation upon <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Capt. Fremont</a> and myself, but 
will receive the heartfelt thanks of a party of some of the bravest and most determined men, who are happy in suffering privations while serving their country with a zeal and fidelity unsurpassed by any other. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
(Signed) <a href="/results.php?tla=ahg" rel="me">Archie H. Gillespie</a>,

1st Lieut. U. S. M. Corps, and Special and Confidential<br>
Agent for California. 
</p><p>
To Jno. B. Montgomery, Esq., Commanding U. S. Ship Portsmouth,<br>
Sausalito, Bay of San Francisco.
