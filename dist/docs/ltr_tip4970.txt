SIR, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your favor of the 8th instant, en 
closing a minute of Congress intimating my appointment to 
the Board of War. This mark of their confidence demands 
my sincere acknowledgments. I accept the commission; 
and, as speedily as the situation of my present affairs will 
admit, shall enter upon the execution of it. 
The business of the department I am not fully informed 
of, but conceive it to be very extensive, and of high importance. As such, I accept the office with diffidence. I 
am personally known to some gentlemen in Congress ; I 
wish they may not have mistaken my abilities. Often an 
opinion has been formed of them, which, however flattering, 
was really a source of mortification to me, from a consciousness that they were rated too high. For nothing, 
therefore, can I engage, but my industry and fidelity ; and, 
if application will enable me to comprehend and execute the 
duties of the office, Congress, I hope, will never have reason 
to regret the appointment with which they have been pleased 
to honor me. I am, Sir," &c. 
</p>
