HEAD QUARTERS, <a rel='day origin' value='18'>18th</a> <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1778' rel="origin">1778</a>.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have barely time to inclose you a <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
paper and to thank you for the epaulettes which you 
were so kind as to send me. 
</p><p>
The General sends you a handbill which has been 
artfully thrown out by the enemy, and which, unless 
properly counteracted, will undubitably tend to foment disunion, perhaps the only and evidently the 
surest method of destroying us. The deserters who 
have come in lately say it is a common talk that overtures are to be made for a treaty of peace. Capt. Gibbes 
of the General's guard is now at Lancaster, and I have 
employed him to purchase me summer wear. My 
want of it will depend upon his success. However, if what is at York is very good, I shall be very glad to 
have as much as will make a skirtless waistcoat and a pair of breeches. 
</p><p>
With respect to the spurs which you have been so 
kind as to take so much trouble about, my reason for 
desiring James to have them changed was on account 
of their weakness. Being all silver they are apt to 
break; and I imagined that he might without difficulty exchange them for a pair of plated. If he can 
not, he must get them mended and I must use them tenderly. 
</p><p>
Apropos to spurs, I think in the present deplorable 
scarcity of good horses, it would be a very acceptable 
present to the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a> on the part of Congress 
to give him an elegant saddle horse. He is exerting 
himself like a lieutenant anxious for promotion, and 
the good effects of his labour are visible. 
</p><p>
The General I apprehend is restrained from writing 
to Congress on this head till he shall be acquainted 
with the sentiments of the brigadiers respecting the 
Baron's rank (but this between ourselves), as far as I 
can learn in conversation with those gentlemen, every 
one is convinced of his zeal and abilities, and thinks 
him deserving of the grade which he asks for. 
</p><p>
Praying your indulgence for this hurried and 
almost illegible production, 
</p><p>
I assure you of my constant love. 
</p><p>

All our foreign publications seem to regard an European war, as a certain consequence of the Elector of Bavaria's death. 
</p><p>
Mr. R. Strettle Jones, an ostensible and a very 
intelligent man, writes from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to a friend 
of his in the army that Lord Chatham was certainly 
at the head of administration. 
</p><p>
The reports of a French war tho stifled as much as possible are generally believed."
