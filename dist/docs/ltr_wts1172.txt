Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I know the railroad depot and three large bridges were 
burned before a soldier of ours had entered <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a>, 
and I know that six hours before the real conflagration 
began I saw half-a-dozen piles of cotton on fire in the 
streets one large pile near the market house where the 
great conflagration began, which fire our soldiers were 
putting out as I rode by it. ... Wade Hampton defended <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> as long as he dared, and then ran away, 
leaving the city full of cotton blowing about like flakes 
of snow. So that trees and frame houses and garden 
fences were literally white. Of course a mayor could 
expect no terms. Being helpless, he took what he could 
get. I told him, of course, I had no intention to burn 
or destroy anything except what my previous orders 
denned. I saw Wade Hampton's cotton order printed 
in a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> paper, but kept no copy, as it was notorious; for he openly declared that Yankee footsteps 
should not pollute his threshold, and he commanded 
everything like corn fodder, etc., to be burnt, lest we 
should get it. ... 
</p><p>
They boasted that we would find a Moscow and its 
consequences. 
</p><p>
The treatment of our officers, prisoners at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a>, 
was enough to have warranted its utter annihilation, 
and after the fire began it required all our efforts to 
prevent its extending to the suburbs, including the Old 
Hampton house, now owned by Preston, brother-inlaw of Wade Hampton, which was saved by John 
Logan. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
