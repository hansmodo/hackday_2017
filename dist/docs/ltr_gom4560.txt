Sir, 
</p><p>
This letter will accompany copies of those, which I had the 
honor to write on the first, and twenty-ninth of May. I have 
heard nothing since from the Duke of Leeds. On the tenth 
of June the King prorogued the parliament, which was dissolved on the eleventh. The election will be completed in 
about ten days, and then the ministers will feel themselves 
more at liberty to avow their intentions, than they are at present. They will have a great majority, though perhaps weaker 
by half a dozen, than in the last house ; but the immense patronage, which must result from a war, will soon overbalance that difference. 
</p><p>
I was told on the tenth, that the Duke of Leeds is to leave 
the office of secretary of foreign affairs, and is to be succeeded by Lord Hawkesbury, formerly Charles Jenkinson. He is 
an able man, strongly opposed to America, and it is said from 
inclination ; but perhaps it is from the desire to please his roy 
al master. Such an appointment would look like a bar to 
any friendly communication with us ; but I incline to think 
otherwise. He will at least be an efficient minister, and what 
ever he agrees to will go smoothly through the cabinet ; 
whereas the present man is evidently afraid of committing him 
self, by saying or doing anything positive. 
</p><p>
On the seventeenth of June I learnt a conversation, which 
had recently passed with Mr Greenville about the posts, from 
the complexion of which I conclude that they are nearly determined to give them up. In the course of that conversation, 
(in which the minister was collecting information from a gentleman acquainted with the country and its trade,) he said that 
the Americans had m-ade some overtures for a commercial 
treaty, which might, perhaps, take place ; and that he wished 
to be prepared, in case that matter should be brought forward, 
which appeared however to be uncertain. 
</p><p>
He mentioned at the same time, but merely as matter of 
common report, that the Spaniards had agreed to give us the 
navigation of the Mississippi. I am therefore confirmed in my 
opinion, that, if they get engaged in a war, they will be glad to 
form a friendly connexion with us. And as to the contingency of war, I was informed on the twenty-first of June, that 
about three weeks before that period, they had sent an express 
over land to India, probably with instructions to prepare for, if 
not to commence hostilities. This, added to many other circumstances, leaves but little room to doubt of their intentions. 
Prussia has been arming and negotiating, and seems as if desirous to gain time, till this country can act.

The fleet which lay at Spithead had sailed some days 
since for Torbay, and is to be joined, it is said, by a Dutch 
squadron, which came forward in the quality of an ally to 
Great Britain. The idea of calling upon an ally to assist 
a British against a Spanish fleet seems to be a little extraordinary. But it would not be extraordinary, that a Dutch squadron should go into the Baltic, and assist the Swedes against Russia. 
</p><p>
We are now so near the moment when the curtain is to be 
drawn up, that I will not trouble you with my conjectures 
about the scenes which are to be displayed. France, I 
am persuaded, will not remain an idle spectator. I am, &c,
