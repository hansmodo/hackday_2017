My dear General, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of hearing from you last week, 
and have complied with your wishes respecting the 
china. No conveyance at present offers for <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a> ; but every day presents one to Norfolk, from 
which place the correspondence up your river is frequent. I intend, unless I should meet with a vessel 
for Potomac, to send the box to Colonel Parker, naval 
officer at Norfolk, and ask his special attention to 
forwarding it to <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. At the 
same time, I will send a small box put into my care 
by Mr. Gardoqui. I have had it some time, and 
wanted to know your intention as to the china, that 
the same conveyance might take both. If you have 
an opportunity to convey my Young (as the books 
are useless to you) to Mr. R. H. Lee, you will oblige 
me by doing it.

The Mississippi business is very important, and 
full of difficulty. In the debilitated condition of the 
Federal Government, it is unwise to wish the offence 
of any part of the empire, unless to attain great 
good. My mind has no doubt of the extensive good 
consequences that would result to the Union from a 
commercial connection with Spain ; and I am also 
clear that, in agreeing to the occlusion of the navigation of the Mississippi, we give in fact nothing; for, 
the moment our western country becomes populous 
and capable, they will seize by force what may have 
been yielded by treaty. Till that period, the river 
cannot be used but by permission of Spain, whose 
exclusive system of policy never will grant such permission. Then, to be sure, we only give what we 
cannot use. But the source of all the evils which 
press these States, is the inefficiency of the Federal 
Government. This cannot he altered and remedied, 
but by consent of the States. Already, in every 
State, the amplification of the powers of the Union 
has too many enemies. Should, therefore, a treaty 
take place between Congress and Spain, occluding 
for a term the navigation of the Mississippi, in return 
for advantages very great, but not so great to the 
whole as to a part, I apprehend it would give such 
a text for popular declaimers, that the great object, 
namely, bracing the Federal Government, may be 
thwarted, and thus, in pursuing a lesser, we lose a 
greater good.

I forwarded, by the last post, for public information, 
some intelligence lately received from <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel=''>Mr. Jefferson</a> ; 
and I have also sent an extract of a letter from Mr. Kendall, from Algiers. These two papers comprehend 
all the news here. I transmit the Gazette of the day. 
Bills on London, at sixty days' sight, fluctuate in their 
value from six to seven per cent, premium. The cost 
of the china is one hundred and fifty dollars, besides 
the incidental charge of freight to Norfolk, which cannot be much. My best wishes for the health and 
happiness of <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, in which Mrs. Lee unites. 
</p><p>
Most respectfully yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=hnl" rel="me">Henry Lee</a>.
