Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter to you, herewith enclosed, will give you the credence necessary to enable you to do the business, which it commits to your management, and which I am persuaded you will readily undertake. 
</p><p>
Your inquiries will commence by observing, that, as the pre^ 
sent constitution of government and of the courts established in 
pursuance of it, removes the objections heretofore made to 
putting the United States in possession of their frontier posts, 
it is natural to expect from the assurances of his Majesty and 
the national good faith, that no unnecessary delays will take 
place. Proceed then to press a speedy performance of the 
treaty, respecting that object. 
</p><p>
Remind them of the article by which it was agreed, that 
negroes belonging to our citizens should not be carried away, 
and of the reasonableness of making compensation for them. 
Learn with precision, if possible, what they mean to do on this 
head. 
</p><p>
The commerce between the two countries you well under 
stand. You are apprized of the sentiments and feelings of the 
United States on the present state of it, and you doubtless have 
heard, that in the late session of Congress, a very respectable 
number of both houses were inclined to a discrimination of du 
ties unfavorable to Britain, and that it would have taken place, 
but for conciliatory considerations, and the probability that the 
late change in our government and circumstances would lead 
to more satisfactory arrangements. 
</p><p>
Request to be informed, therefore, whether they contemplate 
a treaty of commerce with the United States, and on what 
principles or terms in general. In treating this subject, let it be 
strongly impressed on your mind, that the privilege of carrying 
our productions in our vessels to their islands, and of bringing in 
return the productions of those islands to our own ports and 
markets, is regarded here as of the highest importance ; and you. 
will be careful not to countenance any idea of our dispensing 
with it in a treaty. Ascertain, if possible, their views on this 
point ; for it would not be expedient to commence negotiations 
without previously having good reasons to expect a satisfactory 
termination of them. 
</p><p>
It may also be well for you to take a proper occasion of re 
marking, that their omitting to send a minister here, when the 
United States sent one to London, did not make an agreeable 
impression on this country ; and request to know what would 
be their future conduct on similar occasions. 
</p><p>
It is in my opinion very important, that we avoid errors in 
our system of policy respecting Great Britain, and this can only be done by forming a right judgment of their disposition and 
views. Hence you will perceive how interesting it is, that you 
obtain the information in question, and that the business be so 
managed, as that it may receive every advantage, which abilities, address, and delicacy can promise and afford. 
I am. Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
