DEAR MADAM, 
</p><p>
How can I address you, or offer human consolation 
for a wound which must bleed afresh at every attempt 
to assuage it ? 
</p><p>
Yet if the tears of friendship, and a nation's tears 
can afford any relief, be assured, dear Madam, they 
flow from all honest hearts, for you, for your children 
and for a country which mourns one of its brightest 
luminaries extinguished. A great man, fallen in the 
zenith of his glory and in the estimation of his 
ancient friend, the ablest statesman of his age which 
his native state could boast. It is no common loss 
we bewail. Such an assemblage of powerful talents 
rarely meet in one individual united to such an upright and independent mind, which soared above all 
low concerns, and was elevated beyond all selfish 
considerations and party views. 
</p><p>
In domestic life, your own heart alone can do 
justice to his memory. The news of the death of 
Mr. Dexter so sudden, so unexpected, was felt by <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> and myself with the keenest anguish. Out of 
your own immediate circle you have not any one 
who more sincerely, tenderly and affectionately 
sympathizes with you, or who more fervently supplicates the Supreme Being to support and sustain 
you than your sorrowing friend 
</p><p>
Abigail Adams.
