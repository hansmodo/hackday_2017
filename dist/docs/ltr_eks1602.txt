MY DEAR SON,- May 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a>. 
</p><p>
Your excellent letter was received long since. I 
acknowledged its reception immediately in a letter 
to your mother, and should have written to you be 
fore now, were I not so occupied and so inconveniently 
situated in a tent, as to make it almost impossible 
to write at all. One of the most violent storms which 
has assailed us in this region is now raging and it has 
cost me a good ducking and much labor to secure my 
tent. Several of my brother officers are at this mo 
ment standing about in the rain, their tents completely 
blown away and their trunks, bedding, etc., lying 
about in the wet and mud.

Since the battles of Palo Alto (long pole) and Resaca 
de la Palma, which means the watering place of the 
Palmas Palma being the name of a family I have 
written twice to your mother, once from the battle 
field, the day after the action, and again since the 
capture of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>. I hope those letters have 
both been received. I trust, my dear boy, that you 
in your prayers return thanks to a kind Providence 
who has protected your father in the extreme perils 
through which he has passed uninjured. Many men 
were killed and wounded at his side by bullets, undoubtedly aimed at him. Remember this with a 
grateful heart in your daily devotion and pray earnestly that he may be spared in coming dangers so that 
he may train you and your brother in the service of 
that just and Omnipotent Master to whom we must 
all finally render an account.

Your old friend Ryan, who once saved your life, 
was shot through the shoulder by my side on the 
ninth, and Geary, whom you will remember, was shot 
in the forehead and fell at my feet in the action of the 
eighth. They are both recovering rapidly, though I 
fear Ryan will have a stiff arm.

We think there will be no more fighting in the 
valley of the Rio Grande the Mexicans are so 
entirely routed, and we are so much strengthened by 
the arrival of volunteers that it is thought they can 
not in this quarter assemble another army to oppose 
us. . . .
