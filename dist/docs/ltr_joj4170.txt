Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I this morning received your letter of the 9th inst., with 
the interesting sermon which it enclosed, and I thank you 
for them both. 
</p><p>
A proper history of the United States would have much 
to recommend it : in some respects it would be singular, or 
unlike all others ; it would develop the great plan of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, for causing this extensive part of cur world to be 
discovered, and these "uttermost parts of the earth" to be 
gradually filled with civilized and Christian people and 
nations. The means or second causes by which this great 
plan has long been and still is accomplishing, arc materials 
for history, of which the writer ought well to know the use 
and bearings, and proper places. In my opinion, the historian, in the course of the work, is never to lose sight of that 
great plan. 
</p><p>
Remarkable interpositions of Divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> arc fine 
subjects, but the exhibition cannot have a full effect, unless 
accompanied with a distinct view of the objects and state 
of things to which they relate ; it is by discerning how 
admirably they are accommodated and fitted to answer 
their intended purposes, that the reader is made to reflect 
and feel properly. 
</p><p>
Few anions us have time and talent for such a work. I 
am pleased with the prospect of your undertaking it ; and I 
do believe, that with a due allowance of time, that is, of several years, you would execute it well. 
</p><p>
As to aid from me, I am far more willing than able to 
assist you. I became sick last autumn, and have not had a 
well day since. Although better, I am still feeble ; and can 
neither bear much exercise, nor much employment of any 
kind : even in reading and in writing, I find it necessary to 
be abstemious. 
</p><p>
I regret the circumstances which deprived me of the 
pleasure of receiving a visit from you; for no conversations 
are more agreeable to me, than those with persons whom I 
esteem, and in which the utile and the duke arc blended. 
With the best wishes for your health and happiness, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
