DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have seen the enemy. Those in view I calculate 
at about three thousand. There may be, and probably are, enough others out of sight. They have 
sent all their horse to the other side, except about 
fifty or sixty. Their baggage, it is agreed on all 
hands, has also been sent across, and their wounded. 
It is not ascertained that any of their infantry have 
passed to the other side. There are four or five 
hundred on the opposite point, but it is uncertain 
whether they are those who went from this side, or 
those who wore on Staten Island. I rather suppose 
the former. 
</p><p>
Different conjectures may be made. The present 
movement may be calculated to draw us down, and 
betray us into an action. They may have desisted 
from their intention of passing till night, for fear of 
our falling upon their rear. I believe this is the 
case, for, as they have but few boats, it would certainly be a delicate manoeuvre to cross in our face. 
</p><p>
We are taking measures to watch their motions 
to-night as closely as possible. An incessant, but 
very light skirmishing; very few boats, not more 
than enough to carry three or four hundred men 
at a time. It is likely more will come down this 
evening I have the honor to be 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
