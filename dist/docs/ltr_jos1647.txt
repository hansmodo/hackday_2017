My Dear Brother : Your letter was duly received, and 
should have been promptly answered but that I am overwhelmed with calls and engagements. 
</p><p>
You ask why I signed the recommendation of the 
Helper Book. It was a thoughtless, foolish, and unfortunate act. I relied upon the representation that it was 
a political tract to be published under the supervision of 
a committee of which Mr. Blair, a slave-holder, was a 
member. I was assured that there should be nothing 
offensive in it, and so, in the hurry of business of the 
House, I told Morgan, a member of last Congress, to use 
my name. I never read the book, knew nothing of it, 
and now cannot recall that I authorized the use of my 
name. Everybody knows that the ultra sentiments in 
the book are as obnoxious to me as they can be to any 
one, and in proper circumstances I would distinctly say 
so, but under the threat of Clark's resolution, I could 
not, with self respect, say more than I have. 
</p><p>
Whether elected or not, I will at a proper time disclaim 
all sympathy with agrarianisin, insurrection, and other 
abominations in the book. 
</p><p>
In great haste, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
