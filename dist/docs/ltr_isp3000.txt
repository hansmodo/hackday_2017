DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I received your favor of the 28th instant, and have, 
according to your direction, ordered two brigades, 
namely, <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a>'s and Huntington s, to 
put their heavy baggage over the river, and to be in 
readiness to march on the arrival of further orders. 
I have sent Lieutenant-Colonel Dimon to the White 
Plains, with his regiment, to relieve Colonel Cortlandt's detachment there, consisting of his own, Colonel Livingston s, and a party from Colonels Durkee's 
and Chandler's regiments. 
</p><p>
You may think it not necessary to keep a party 
at the White Plains, but, unless we do, the inhabit 
ants will be ruined; their grass, grain, and cattle 
will all be taken off by the enemy. There are seven 
hundred militia at the forts and different posts, whose 
time is out to-day, and must be discharged. I have 
advised with <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> in respect to calling in 
the militia, and concluded that one thousand should 
be called for immediately, five hundred from Connectsicut, and five hundred from this State ; and an Express was immediately sent off to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a>, 
requesting them to be sent without delay. But the 
season of the year renders it very difficult and doubtful whether they will turn out or not. When the two 
brigades are marched, now under orders, there will be 
left on this side the river two small brigades, consisting of two thousand three hundred and forty-seven, 
of which two thousand and fifty-one are returned fit 
for duty. Five hundred must be kept at the White 
Plains for the reasons above mentioned, five hundred 
at the Forts Independence, Montgomery, and Constitution. A subaltern's guard is kept at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> 
to guard the stores, another is necessary at Robin 
son's Mills for the same purpose, although, at present, the latter is only a sergeant s. The men for the 
ships and boats are principally out of these brigades, 
so that there will not be left a thousand men to keep 
up our guards, and to defend this important post and 
the passes. There are, I am well assured, five or six 
thousand troops at King's Bridge and Fort <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
You had not received my two last letters, I perceive, at the time of writing yours. You will see, 
Sir, by this stating, how exposed and weak we are 
at this post, as well as the whole Eastern country, 
in case an attack should be made on any part. 
</p><p>
I am so unhappy as to differ from your Excellency 
with respect to the enemy's motions. Many considerations concur to evince that this post, or some more 
eastward, will be the real point of attack. This will 
divide and distract the New England militia, directly 
coincide with <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s operation, who is 
making his way to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, divide the Continent, facilitate the junction of their forces, and cut off all 
communication between the Northern and Southern 
States. In addition to this, their fleet was seen from 
Blue Point, standing eastward, of which I wrote you 
in my last. To draw the forces from this post, so as 
to return and get possession of the passes through 
the Highlands, is, I conceive, an object of so much 
consequence, that no cost or pains would be spared 
by General Howe for the obtainment of it. If it is 
not absolutely certain that the enemy are gone for 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, it is certain they may come here or go 
eastward; and should they, as they will, if my conjectures are right, it is certain the consequences must be very serious and unhappy, on account of so many 
of the troops being gone to the southward. 
</p><p>
If their real design is for this, or further eastward, 
it is very certain they would make as great show of 
a real intent to go to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> as possible. By 
a deserter, who canie from King's Bridge day before 
yesterday, I learn that three hundred horses, with 
wagons, are come from Long Island to King's Bridge; 
that they are building a new redoubt that is to mount 
six guns, which will be finished this week, and then 
they design to come out with a great foraging party, 
as they say; but something more is doubtless intend 
ed. But, if no more, Colonel Dimon's regiment will 
be unequal to their force, and it may be thought 
imprudent for me to leave this post. I am further 
informed by a Captain that has been in their service 
and left them, that there were two thousand men on 
Staten Island, two regiments of Hessians, and Cortland Skinner's brigade. There is a report that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> is at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>. I am, most respect-fully, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant,
