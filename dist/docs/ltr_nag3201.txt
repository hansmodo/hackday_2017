</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 21st came to hand 
the evening of the 25th. 
</p><p>
In my last I communicated to your Excellency the 
departure of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a> with his fleet, for 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This disagreeable event has, as I apprehend, 
ruined all our operations. It struck such a panic 
among the militia and volunteers, that they began to 
desert by shoals. The fleet no sooner set sail, than 
they began to be alarmed for their safety. This mis 
fortune damped the hopes of our army, and gave 
new spirits to that of the enemy. 
</p><p>
We had a very respectable force, as to numbers ; 
between eight and nine thousand, rank and file, upon 
the ground ; but of these we attempted to select a 
particular corps to possess ourselves of the enemy's lines, partly by force, and partly by stratagem; but 
w r e could not make up the necessary number that 
was thought sufficient to warrant the attempt, which 
was five thousand, including the Continental and 
State troops. This body was to consist of men, who 
had been in actual service before, not less than nine months. However, the men were not to be had, and, 
if they could have been found, there was more against 
it than for it. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> was to have opened 
the passage by landing within the enemy's lines, and 
getting possession of a redoubt at the head of Easton's beach. If we had failed in the attempt, the 
whole party must have fallen a sacrifice, for their 
situation would have been such that there was no 
possibility of getting off. 
</p><p>
I shall inclose your Excellency a plan of the enemy's works, and of their strength, from the best ac 
counts we are able to get. They have never been 
out of their lines since the siege began, till, night be 
fore last, Colonel Bruce came out with one hundred 
and fifty men, to take off a small picket of ours, 
posted at the neck of Easton's beach. He partly succeeded in the attempt, by the carelessness of the old 
guard. He came over after dark, and lay in ambush, 
that when the new guard went down to take their 
post, the enemy came upon their backs before they 
discovered them, it being very dark. We lost twenty-four privates and two subalterns. Ten of the picket got off. 
</p><p>
Our strength is now reduced from nine thousand 
to between four and five thousand. All our heavy 
cannon on garrison carriages, and heavy and superfluous stores of every kind, are removed to the main, 
and to the north end of the Island, where we intend 
to intrench and attempt to hold it, and wait the 
chance of events. <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a> is gone to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to forward the repairs of the fleet, and to prepare the mind of the Count for a speedy return. 
How far he will succeed, I cannot pretend to say. I 
think it a matter of some doubt yet, whether the 
enemy will reenforce, or take off this garrison. If 
they expect a superior fleet from Europe, they will 
reenforce ; but, if not, they will remove the garrison. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency may rest assured, that I have done every thing in my power to cultivate and promote a 
good understanding, both with the Count and the 
Marquis, and flatter myself that I am upon very good terms with them both. The Marquis's great thirst 
for glory, and national attachment, often run him into 
errors. However, he did every thing to prevail on 
the Admiral to cooperate with us, that man could 
do. People censure the Admiral with great freedom, 
and many are imprudent enough to reproach the 
nation through the Admiral. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> very 
imprudently issued something like a censure in general orders. Indeed, it was an absolute censure. It 
opened the mouths of the army in very clamorous 
strains. The General was obliged to explain it away 
in a few days. The fermentation seems to be now 
subsiding, and all things appear as if they would go 
smoothly on. The Marquis is going to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, also, 
to hasten the Count's return, and, if possible, to get 
the Erench troops to join the land forces here, which 
will more effectually interest the Count in the success 
of the expedition. 
</p><p>
Five sail of British ships have got into <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a> 
within two days past. We have heard nor seen no 
thing of the fleet of transports your Excellency mentioned, in your letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> of the 
23d. If they arrive with a large reenforcement, our expedition is at an end, unless it is by way of 
blockade, and that will depend upon the French 
fleet's being superior to that of the British, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> has done every thing that could 
be expected, and had the fleet cooperated with us as 
was at first intended, and agreeably to the original 
plan of the expedition, we must have been successful. 
I wish it was in my power to confirm <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>'s prediction of the 17th, but I cannot flatter my 
self with such an agreeable issue. I am sensible he 
is in common very sanguine, but his expectations 
were not ill-founded in the present case. We had 
every reason to hope for success, from our numbers, 
and from the enemy's fears. Indeed, General Pigot 
was heard to say, the garrison must fall, unless they 
were speedily relieved by a British fleet. If we could 
have made a landing upon the south part of the 
town, two days would have put us in complete possession of it. Nothing was wanting to effect this, but 
the cooperation of the fleet and French forces. The 
disappointment is vexatious and truly mortifying. 
The garrison was so important, and the reduction so 
certain, that I cannot with patience think of the 
event. The French ship that was missing has got 
into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. The rest of the fleet have not got there 
yet, or at least we have no accounts of their arrival. 
</p><p>
We are very anxious to learn the condition of Lord 
Howe's fleet. The French seventy-four that has got 
into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> had an engagement with a British sixty-four. The Captain and Lieutenant of the former were 
both wounded; one lost a leg, the other an arm. 
</p><p>
Our troops are in pretty good health, and well furnished with provisions, and every thing necessary for 
carrying on the expedition. 
</p><p>
Our approaches were pushed on with great spirit, 
while we had any hopes of the fleet cooperating with 
us ; but the people lost all relish for digging, after 
that. 
People are very anxious to hear the issue of General Lee's trial. Various are the conjectures ; but 
everybody agrees he is not acquitted. 
</p><p>
August olst. Camp Tiverton. I wrote the foregoing, and intended to have sent it by the express 
that went off in the morning, but while I was writing, I was informed the express was gone; and the 
change of situation and round of events that have 
since taken place, have prevented my forwarding 
what I had wrote, as matters seemed to be coming 
to a crisis. 
</p><p>
On the evening of the 29th, the army fell back to 
the north end of the Island. The next morning, the 
enemy advanced upon us in two columns upon the 
east and west road. Our light troops, commanded by 
Colonel Livingston and <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, attacked the 
heads of the columns about seven o'clock in the morning, but were beat back they were reinforced with a regiment upon each road. The enemy still proved 
too strong. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> formed the army in order of battle, and resolved to wait their approach 
upon the ground we were encamped on, and sent 
orders to the light troops to fall back. The enemy 
came up and formed upon Quaker Hill, a very strong 
piece of ground, within about one mile and a quarter 
of our line. We were well posted, with strong works 
in our rear, and a strong redoubt in front, partly 
upon the right of the line. 
</p><p>
In this position a warm cannonade commenced, and 
lasted for several hours, with continual skirmishes in 
front of both lines. About two o'clock the enemy 
began to advance in force upon our right, as if they 
intended to dislodge us from the advanced redoubt. 
I had the command of the right wing. After advancing four regiments, and finding the enemy still gaining ground, I advanced with two more regiments of 
regular troops, and a brigade of militia, and at the 
same time <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> ordered Colonel Livings 
ton, with the light troops under his command, to ad 
vance. We soon put the enemy to the rout, and I 
had the pleasure to see them run in worse disorder 
than they did at the battle of Monniouth. Our troops 
behaved with great spirit; and the brigade of militia, 
under the command of General Lovell, advanced with 
great resolution and in good order, and stood the fire 
of the enemy with great firmness. Lieutenant-Colonel 
Livingston, Colonel Jackson, and Colonel Henry B. 
Livingston, did themselves great honor in the transactions of the day; but it's not in my power to do 
justice to <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, who acted both the General and the partisan. His command of regular troops 
was small, but he did every thing possible to be 
done by their numbers. He had two most excellent 
officers with him, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and Major Talbot, 
</p><p>
The enemy fell back to their strong ground, and 
the day terminated with a cannonade and skirmishes. 
Both armies continued in their position all day yesterday, cannonading each other every now and then. 
Last night we effected a very good retreat, without 
the loss of men or stores. 
</p><p>
We have not collected an account of the killed and 
wounded, but we judge our loss amounts to between 
two and three hundred, and that of the enemy, to 
much more. 
</p><p>
We are going to be posted all round the shores 
as a guard upon them, and in that state to wait for 
the return of the fleet, which, by the by, I think will 
not be in a hurry. 
It is reported that Lord Howe arrived last night 
with his fleet and the re enforcement mentioned in 
your Excellency's letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>. If the 
report is true, we got off the island in very good 
season. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>Marquis</a> went to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> the day before the 
action, and did not return until last night, just as we 
were leaving the Island. He went to wait upon the 
Admiral, to learn his further intentions, and to get 
him to return again and complete the expedition, if 
possible. 
</p><p>
I observe your Excellency thinks the enemy design 
to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. If they should, I think they 
will <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a> also; but I am persuaded they will do 
neither for the present. 
</p><p>
I would write your Excellency a more particular account of the battle and retreat, but I imagine <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> have done it already, and I am myself very much unwell. I have had 
no sleep for three nights and days, being severely 
afflicted with the asthma. I am, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
