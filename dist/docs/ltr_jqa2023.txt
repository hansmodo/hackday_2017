MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
A variety of circumstances have occurred since you left 
this part of the country, which have combined to change 
in some measure the state of our parties in the State. You 
have probably heard of them from other quarters, and 
ought to have heard of them before this from me. I will endeavor to retrieve as far as possible my former deficiency, 
and to give an account of the present situation of affairs 
here, so far as I can collect my information from public 
report. 
</p><p>
In the month of October a town meeting was held in 
this town, wherein it was voted to petition our General 
Court for a repeal of the law prohibiting theatrical exhibitions. The vote was carried by a large majority; but the 
party opposed to the measure was numerous, and a counter- 
petition, signed by more than three hundred persons was 
presented to the legislature at the same time with the 
petition for the repeal. Upon this subject the Lieutenant 
Governor, and Dr. Jarvis were upon the opposite sides of 
the question, and debated the point so warmly together 
that a coolness it is said has ensued between them since 
that time. This however is a matter of small moment in 
comparison with another event which has produced a more 
extraordinary variance. 
</p><p>
When the vacancy upon the bench of our Supreme Judicial Court, occasioned by the death of Judge Sargeant, 
was to be filled up, the Governor was sollicited by the friends 
of Mr. Dawes (by his father particularly, and perhaps by 
himself) to fix upon him for the office ; and whether from 
motives of personal friendship, or from pecuniary obligations, or from an idea of the family influence of the man and 
a wish to secure it in his own favor, or whatever his reasons 
were, he did, without consulting an individual member of 
the Council, or any of the Judges of the Supreme Court, or 
even his confidential favorite and adviser, Sullivan, nominate Mr. Dawes. The nomination met with universal dis 
approbation. The bench, the bar, and the people at large 
in every part of the state were dissatisfied. The opinion 
that Dawes was not a proper man for the office was universal, and the importance of the office itself greatly in 
creased the discontent which the nomination occasioned. 
That discontent however would have evaporated in a momentary censure of the levity and caprice of the Governor, 
as it has upon many former occasions, had not the arrangement interfered with the views of private interest, and with 
the designs of faction. From the first moment of the nomination, it has met with an avowed and determined opposition from Sullivan and from Judge Dana, who appear even 
to have joined in a sort of combination to obstruct the 
progress of the appointment. Sullivan has clamored in all 
his private conversations, has scribbled anonymously in the 
newspapers, has personally urged Mr. Dawes to decline the 
appointment, and wrote a long letter to the Governor, persuading him to withdraw the nomination ; and he has so 
decidedly and perseveringly pursued this line of conduct, 
that an actual rupture has taken place between him and the 
Governor. Nay, I have some reason to conjecture that he 
has serious thoughts of advancing as a candidate for the 
chair himself in opposition to the present possessor. The 
pretext of his violent opposition to Dawes is an ardent zeal 
for the dignity of the State. And as an enemy of the 
national government his principle is certainly well founded. 
The Supreme Court of the State has lost much of the veneration of the people by a former appointment. It is indeed 
surprising how that diminution of confidence has in so short 
a period of time since the last change pervaded every part 
of the Commonwealth ; and the mortification of the party 
is greatly aggravated by the respectability of the national 
courts, and the growing attachment of the people to them. 
In addition to this it is said that Sullivan expected that the 
salaries of our judges would, before the vacancy should be 
filled up, be raised to 500, in which case he would have 
stood ready to take the place himself, and in the opinion 
of many people his disappointment in this particular has 
exceedingly sharpened his zeal for the dignity of the State. 
Of Judge Dana I feel myself always obliged in duty, and 
from personal attachment, to speak with respect and 
reverence; but in writing to you upon the state of our 
politics I must not conceal the opinions which are held 
with respect to the motives of his conduct. He has been 
equally open and decided against Mr. Dawes with Sullivan, 
and equally active in endeavoring to prevent the appointment. His patriotism and public spirit are allowed, and 
admitted as being much more forcible principles to actuate 
him than Sullivan ; but the peculiar earnestness and even 
virulence with which he pursues Dawes at present, has 
given occasion to a suggestion that the prospect of failing 
to obtain an augmentation of his salary, contributed not a 
little to give additional vigor to his patriotic ardor. His 
eyes as well as those of Sullivan are supposed to be fixed 
upon the chair of State, and possibly he may anticipate an 
increase of his own popularity by maintaining a contest 
against an unpopular measure. The views of the two men 
are so widely different, and indeed so irreconcileable together, 
that they cannot long act in concert. But as the object of 
keeping Dawes from the bench is a favorite point with both, 
they have apparently formed a coalition for this particular 
purpose. They have both endeavored to persuade Dawes 
to decline ; both used all their influence with the members 
of the council, that the nomination might be disapprobated, 
but in vain. To decline an appointment which he had sollicited, and obtained notwithstanding the opposition of Sullivan's influence with the Governor, would in Dawes's 
opinion betray a want of spirit on his part, and after get 
ting so good hold of the public loaf, he has no disposition 
to relinquish it. The Council, though most of them were 
dissatisfied, yet would not by passing a negative upon the 
Governor's choice, cast a stigma upon the character of a 
man whom they considered as only unequal to the office ; 
and as to the Governor himself, in addition to all the motives 
which originally operated to determine his election, he is 
now induced from obstinacy and resentment to support the 
man whom he brought forward. Dawes is therefore ap 
pointed and has accepted the appointment. Mr. Dana 
however does not yet give the point. At the same time 
when Mr. Dawes was nominated, Dana was appointed to 
the vacant seat of Chief Justice ; but he has not yet accepted, 
and it is said he intends actually to decline accepting it, 
and that, for the purpose of bringing in question the legality of Dawes's appointment. Our law says the Supreme 
Court shall be held by one Chief Justice and four other 
justices, and the inference is that as there were four other 
justices at the time whem Mr. Dana was nominated, the 
Governor had no right to propose a fifth until the Chief 
Justice had declared his acceptance, and taken the oath of 
office. Thus the affair now rests, and the result of all the 
plots and counterplots will probably appear in the course of 
three or four weeks, when the next session of the Supreme 
Court is to be held in this town.
</p><p>
I wrote to my brother by the last post an account of another transaction, which has occasioned much altercation in 
this town, and has also contributed to widen the difference 
in the party. Sullivan and Jarvis strenuously supported 
the system that was proposed, and it was opposed violently 
by Ben. Austin and by the influence of the Lieutenant 
Governor, though he did not publicly appear against it. 
The parties were very severe upon each other in the public 
town meetings, and are said to be still at variance, but 
whether from a sense of necessity for the mutual support of 
their own importance, and of their hostile spirit to the national government, they will again come together, or whether 
they will continue to separate until a complete disunion and 
opposition of pursuit shall ensue, must be left to the determination of time.
