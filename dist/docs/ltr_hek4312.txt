Sir, 
</p><p>
Since the letter I had the honor of transmitting 
the 21st instant, I have received a letter from Governor Blount, dated the 4th instant. A meeting of 
the Cherokees, at Estanaula, had taken place, which 
lasted from the 24th of June to the 1st of July, at 
which the Little Turkey and many other Chiefs were 
present ; but the Bloody Fellow, and John Watts, 
whom the Governor, in his former letter, styled "the 
champions for peace," were absent. But most of the 
others who composed the delegation were present. 
The dispositions manifested were friendly. A number 
of Chiefs were selected to protect the boats, which 
were to pass down the Tennessee with the goods designed for the Conference to be held with the Chickasaws and Choctaws, at <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a>. But the Little 
Turkey expressed considerable dissatisfaction at the 
line towards Cumberland, alleging it to be the hunting grounds of the Four Nations, to wit, the Creeks, 
Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws. It is to be 
observed that this man is the most influential Chief 
of the Cherokees, and that he was neither at the 
treaty of Hopewell, in <a href='/results.php?year=1785'>1785</a>, nor Holstein, in <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>. I 
have had some doubts, whether that part of the line 
was agreeable to the opinion of the Cherokees generally ; and it really appears to me that something 
will yet be to be arranged on that subject. 
</p><p>
Some Indians, supposed to be Creeks, have committed several murders at <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a>, and have wounded General Robertson and his son. The Governor 
has had discretionary power to call forth such portions of militia as he should judge expedient for the 
protection of the exposed parts of his Government, 
and he has, at different periods, actually called for 
five companies of militia, most of which are now in 
service. The Governor expected the Chickasaws and 
Choctaws to meet him, at <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a>, about the 25th 
instant. The goods for the Conference at <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a> 
left Holstein, under the charge of Mr. Allison, the 3d 
instant, under a proper escort, besides the Indian 
Chiefs before mentioned. The Governor and <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague'>General Pickens</a> were to set out for <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a> on the 5th instant, to cross Cumberland Mountains, escorted by 
some horse, which he called out for the occasion. 
</p><p>
The Governor has transmitted the affidavits of two 
men, recently from the Creek country, tending to 
prove the interference of the Spanish Agent to prevent the Creeks from running the line ; and also of 
some parties of Creeks making depredations on the 
Cumberland settlements. It -would seem the Creeks 
consider the Cumberland settlers as intruders on the 
joint lands of the Four Nations, and therefore they 
have a right to steal horses, and, in case of opposition, 
to kill. It is to be hoped the Governor may devise 
some measures to prevent the progress of those depredations, which lead to a general confusion and war 
with the Creeks and Cherokees. I shall write him 
by the way of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. 
</p><p>
No information yet of Colonel Hardin or Major Trueman. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>, on the 20th, gives information of some recent depredations by small parties 
in Ohio county About three hundred and twenty 
effectives of his troops had arrived. The information 
of recruits, since the last return, is agreeable to the 
within. The desertions of the troops, on the march, 
are excessive. Out of about three hundred and fifty, 
nearly fifty deserted from Reading to <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> has returned from the western 
parts of this State. I have intimated to him your 
desire of his repairing to his Government ; but he 
says it will be extremely inconvenient to him to do 
it, as he has a lawsuit to be tried in September next. 
He seems to think that it would not be proper or 
necessary for him to be present at the trial of Ensign 
Morgan. He is to deliver me his evidence in a week 
or ten days, when I shall order Mr. Morgan to join 
the army, for his trial. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,
