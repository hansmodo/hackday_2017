<a rel='month origin' value='11'>November</a> <a rel='day origin' value='28'>28th</a>  [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. We dined at Mrs. McCord's. She is as strong a cordial for broken spirits and failing heart as 
one could wish. How her strength contrasts with our weakness. Like Doctor Palmer, she strings one up to bear 
bravely the worst. She has the intellect of a man and the perseverance and endurance of a woman.

We have lost nearly all of our men, and we have no money, and it looks as if we had taught the Yankees how to 
fight since Manassas. Our best and bravest are under the sod ; we shall have to wait till another generation grows up. 
Here we stand, despair in our hearts (" Oh, Cassandra, don t! " shouts Isabella), with our houses burning or about 
to be, over our heads.

The North have just got things ship-shape; a splendid army, perfectly disciplined, with new levies coming in day 
and night. Their gentry do not go into the ranks. They hardly know there is a war up there.
