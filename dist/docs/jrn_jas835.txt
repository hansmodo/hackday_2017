The travelling to the Mines was increasing from day to day, and no more Notice was taken, as the people arrived from South America, Mexico, Sandwich Islands, Oregon, etc. All the Ships Crews, and Soldiers deserted. In the beginning of July, Col. Mason our Military Governor, with Capt. Sherman (Secretary of State) Capt. Folsom, Quartermstr, and an Escort, of which some deserted, and some other Gentlemen, travelled in Company with the Governor.

As we wanted to celebrate the 4th of July we invited the Governor and his suite to remain with us, and be accepted. Kyburg gave us a good Diner, every thing was pretty well arranged. Pickett was the Orator. It was well done enough for such a new Country and in such an excitement and Confusion. And from this time on you know how every thing was going on here. One thing is certain that the people looked on my property as their own, and in the Winter of 1849 to 1850, a great Number of horses has been stolen from me, whole Manadas of Mares driven away and taken to Oregon etc. Nearly my whole Stock of Cattle has been Killed, several thousands, and left me a very small Quantity. The same has been done with my large stock of Hogs, which was running like ever under nobodies care and so it was easy to steal them. I had not an Idea that people could be so mean, and that they would do a Wholesale business in Stealing.

On the upper Sacramento, that is, from the Buttes downward to the point or Mouth of feather River, there was most all of my Stock running and during the Overflow the Cattle was in a many bands on high spots like Islands. There was a fine chance to approach them in small Boats and shoot them. This business has been very successfully done by one party of 5 Men (partners) which had besides hired people, and Boats Crews, which transported the beef to the Market at Sacramento City and furnished that City with my own beef, and because these Men was nearly alone, on account of the Overflow, and Monopolized the Market.
</p><p>
In the Spring of 1850, these 5 men divided their Spoil of $60,000 clear profits made of Cattle. All of them left for the Atlantic State; one of them returned again in the Winter from 1850 to 51, hired a new band of Robers to follow the same business and kill of the balance or the few that was left. My Baqueros found out this Nest of thiefs in the their Camp butchering just some heads of my Cattle. On their return they informed me what they have seen. In the neighborhood of the same Camp they saw some more cows shot dead, which the Rascal then butchered. Immediately I did send to Nicolaus for the Sheriff (Jas. Hopkins) as then at the time we had laws in force?!? After all was stolen and destroyed the Sheriff arrived at Hock farm. I furnished him a Posse of my employed Men. They proceeded over on the Sacramento to where the thiefs were encamped. As the Sheriff wanted to arrest them they just jumped in their Boats and off they went, the Sheriff threatened them to fire at them, but that was all, and laughing they went at large.

One day my Son was riding after Stock a few miles below Hock farm. He found a Man (his name was Owens) butchering one of our finest milch Cows (of Durham stock of Chile, which cost $300.) He told the Man that he could not take the Meat, that he would go home and get people, and so he has done, and he got people and Wagon and returned to the Spot but Owens found it good to clear out. Two brothers of this Man was respectable Merchants in Lexington Mo. and afterwards in Westport well acquainted with me. He came one day in my house and brought me their compliments, I received him well, and afterwards turned out to be a thief. How many of this kind came to California which loosed their little honor by crossing the Istmus or the plains. I had nothing at all to do with speculations, but stuck by the plough, but by paying such high Wages, and particularly under Kyburg's management, I have done this business with a heavy loss as the produce had no more the Value like before, and from the time on Kyburg left I curtailed my business considerable, and so far that I do all at present with my family and a few Indian Servants. I did not speculate, only occupied my land, in the hope that it would be before long decided and in my favor by the U. S. Land Commission; but now already 3 years & two months have elapsed, and I am waiting now very anxiously for the Decission, which will revive or bring me to the untimely grave.

All the other Circumstances you know all yourself, perhaps I have repeated many things which I wrote in the 3 first sheets, because I had them not to see what I wrote, and as it is now several months I must have forgotten. Well it is only a kind of memorandum, and not a History at all, Only to remember you on the different periods when such and such things happened.
</p><p>
I need not mention again, that all the Visitors has allways been hospitably received and treated. That all the sick and wounded found allways Medical Assistance, Gratis, as I had nearly all the time a Physician in my employ. The Assistance to the Emigrants, that is all well known. I dont need to write anything about this.
</p><p>
I think now from all this you can form some facts, and that you can mention how thousands and thousands made their fortunes, from this Gold Discovery produced through my industry and energy, (some wise merchants and others in San francisco called the building of this Sawmill, another of Sutter's folly) and this folly saved not only the Mercantile World from Bankruptcy, but even our General Gov't. but for me it has turned out a folly, then without having discovered the Gold, I would have become the richest wealthiest man on the Pacific Shore.
