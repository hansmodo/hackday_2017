You and I may differ in our premises, but will agree in 
our conclusions. I A government resting immediately 011 
the caprice of a people is too unstable to last. The will 
of the people is the ultimate appeal, but the Constitution, laws of Congress, and regulations of the executive 
departments subject to the decisions of the Supreme 
Court are the laws which all must obey without stopping to inquire why. All must obey. Government, 
that is, the executive, having no discretion but to execute the law, must be to that extent despotic. If this 
be our Government, it is the " best on earth " but if the 
people of localities can bias and twist the law or execution of it to suit their local prejudices, then our Government is the worst on earth. | If you look back only two 
years, you will see the application. There are about six 
millions of men in this country all/thinking themselves 
sovereign and qualified to govern. I Some thirty-four 
governors of States who feel like petty kings, and about 
ten thousand editors who presu/ne to dictate to generals, 
presidents, and cabinets. I t^eat all these as nothing, 
but when a case arises I simpljy ask: Where is the law? 
Supposing the pilot of a ship should steer his vessel 
according to the opinion of every fellow who watched 
the clouds above or the currents below, where would his 
ship land? No, the pilot has before him a little needle; 
he watches that, and he never errs. So if we make that 
our simple code, the law of the land must and shall be 
executed; no matter what the consequences, we cannot 
err. Hundreds and thousands may honestly differ as to 
what the law should be, but it is rarely the case; but all 
men of ordinary understanding can tell what the law is. 
We have for years been drifting towards an unadulterated 
democracy or demagogism, and its signs were manifest 
in Mob Laws and Vigilance Committees all over our 
country. And States and towns and mere squads of men 
took upon themselves to set aside the Constitution and 
laws of Congress and substitute therefor their own 
opinions. I saw it, and tried to resist it in California, 
but always the General Government yielded to the pressure. I say that our Government, judged by its conduct 
as a whole, paved the way for rebellion. The South 
that lived on slavery saw the United States yield to 
abolition pressure at the North, to pro-slavery pressure 
at the South, to the miners of California, the rowdies of 
Baltimore, and to the people everywhere. They paved 
the way to this rebellion. The people of the South 
were assured that, so far from resisting an attempt to 
set up an independent Government of homogeneous 
interests, the United States would give in and yield. 
They appealed to precedents, and proved it, and I confess I had seen so much of it that I doubted whether our 
Government would not yield to the pressure, and die a 
natural death. But I confess my agreeable surprise. 
Though full of corruption and base materials, our country is a majestic one, full of natural wealth and good 
people. They have risen not in full majesty, but enough 
to give all hopes of vitality. Our progress has been as 
rapid as any philosopher could ask. The resources of 
the land in money, in men, in provisions, in forage, and 
in intelligence, has surprised us all, and we have had as 
much success as could be hoped for. The Mississippi is 
now ours, not by commission but by right, by the right 
of manly power. . . . No great interest in our land has 
risen superior to Government, and I deem it fortunate 
that no man has risen to dictate terms to all. Better as 
it is. Lincoln is but the last of the old school Presidents, the index (mathematically) of one stage of our 
national existence. . . . Our Government should become 
a machine, self -regulating, independent of the man. . . . 
fAs to the press of America, it is a shame and a reproach to a civilized people. ... I begin to feel a high 
opinion of myself that I am their butt; I shall begin to 
suspect myself of being in a decline when a compliment 
appears in type.j I know in what estimation I am held 
by my press, those who have been with me all the 
time, and they are capable to judge, from private to 
major-generals. I saw a move to bring Grant and myself East. No they don't. . . .

We will be in Mobile in October and Georgia by 
Christmas if required. . . .

I see much of the people here men of heretofore 
high repute. The fall of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> has had a powerful 
effect. They are subjugated. I ey^n am amazed at the 
effect ; we are actually feeding the people. . . . 
</p><p>
Grant and wife visited me in c^mp yesterday. I have 
the handsomest camp I ever saw, and should really be 
glad to have visitors come do^n. I don't think a shot 
will be fired at a boat till Jeff pavis can call his friends 
about him and agree upon the next campaign. I want 
recruits and conscripts, and shall be all ready in October. 
As ever, your brother,
