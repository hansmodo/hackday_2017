DEAR Jay, 
</p><p>
I won't dispute who has written most. I have written more than twice what you acknowledge to have received, but this is of no consequence. 
</p><p>
I am sorry for your session, but I wished you had marked out what taxes have been laid, what salaries given, and a 
few more striking outlines of legislation. These, with what I know of your men, would have enabled me to imagine proper lights and shades. 
</p><p>
I choose that my friends should write freely, and those 
who know me must know that such freedoms need no 
apology. I never thought the person you allude to so 
steady as could be wished. We have all of us our weak 
sides ; would to God that were the worst. 
</p><p>
What you mention relative to our plan of rights shall be 
attended to. I am a busy man, though, as heretofore, a 
pleasurable one. 
</p><p>
Let your governor cleanse the Augean stable in his State, 
which no public body would do though it stink under their 
noses. I am labouring at arrangements of various kinds. 
God prosper me, and give me patience and industry. It 
was a good wish from one who knew my wants. 
</p><p>
We have ordered troops from the highlands, but we will 
send thither a general, who shall be empowered to call forth 
the swarms of the eastern hive. Men were necessary at 
the <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a>. I have a good knack at guessing. I 
guess the enemy won't attempt Hudson River. 
</p><p>
I do think of Vermont : and unless I mistake, matters 
shall be managed to effect, without bellowing in the forum, 
which I believe hath been a little too much the case. But 
why should I blame impetuous vivacity, â€” hath it never led 
me into an error ? 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=isp" rel="">Putnam</a> will soon be tried. The affair of <a href="/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="">Schuyler</a> and <a href="/results.php?tla=arc" rel="">St. Clair</a> laboured under awkward circumstances. Their 
friends and their enemies appear to me to have been equally 
blind. I enclose extracts from the minutes made the other 
night to possess myself of the real state of facts. There are 
some other entries from time to time. It was erroneous to 
order a committee simply to collect facts ; they should have 
been directed to state charges. This morning, my colleague 
being absent, I got a committee appointed for the latter 
purpose : Sherman, Dana (Massachusetts), and <a href="/results.php?tla=wid" rel="">Drayton</a> (South Carolina). This was unanimous, and yet I would 
have undertaken to argue for it in a style which would absolutely have ruined the measure. You know it would have 
been easy to say, justice to those injured gentlemen, instead 
of justice to an injured country requires, &c. 
</p><p>
Great Britain seriously means to treat. Our affairs are 
most critical, though not dangerously so. If the minister 
from France were present as well as him from England, I 
am a blind politician if the thirteen States (with their extended territory), would not be in peaceable possession of 
their independence three months from this day. As it is, 
expect a long war. I believe it will not require such astonishing efforts after this campaign to keep the enemy at bay. 
Probably a treaty is signed with the house of Bourbon ere 
this ; if so, a spark hath fallen upon the train which is to 
fire the world. Ye gods ! what havoc doth ambition make 
among your works. 
My dear friend, adieu. My love to your wife, Remember me to all my friends of every rank" and sex. 
</p><p>
I am yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gom" rel="me">Gouverneur Morris</a>. 
</p><p>
P.S. I meant to have said, the present is within the 
spirit of our constitution, a special occasion.
