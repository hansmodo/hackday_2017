DID YOU ever hear of Jim Beckwith? There is a class of men in California whose adventures, if written out, would equal, if not surpass the works of fiction. For many years living in the mountains, enduring all the privations and suffering incident to such a life, from choice, forsaking the comforts of a civilized land to gain a scanty and precarious living among savages--these men have been awakened to a desire of procuring wealth by the universal attraction of California, and have emerged from their bleak and desolate hills among the Rocky Mountains, to form an atom of the thousands crowding here for gold; and of this bold, determined and fearless class is Jim Beckwith. He is a free mulatto from Missouri, originally. By a combination of circumstances he found himself a mountaineer and the chief of the Crow Nation, among the Black Hills, high up in the vicinity of the North Platte.
</p><p>
According to the custom of Indians who are friendly with each other, Jim had a wife among the Blackfeet as well as among the Crows. Being out once upon some wild excursion, he met a party of Blackfeet going to war with some neighboring tribe; and at their solicitation, he joined them. They were victorious and returned with a number of scalps; among them was that of a mountaineer whom some of the Indians had killed. Jim took this opportunity to go and see his wife among the Blackfeet, and a great festival was held in their large town to celebrate their victory. In the lodge which Jim's wife occupied were three or four French traders, with their goods, whose curiosity led them to the door of the lodge to witness the antics of the Indians, while Jim sat moodily by a small fire inside, leaning his head in his hands and holding no communion with the noisy and reckless throng without. Raising his eyes he observed the curiosity of the Frenchmen who were gazing at the crowd, and he addressed them, "Why do you stand looking upon that scene?"
</p><p>
"Because we want to see them dance," they replied.
</p><p>
"Do you not know that the scalp of a white man is among them and can you look coolly on and see them rejoice over his death? I
never did," and he added vehemently, "I never will. If you know what is best for you, come and sit down with me."
</p><p>
They came in, for they knew he was not to be trifled with, but inquired, "If you dislike it, why do you let your squaw dance with them?"
</p><p>
"Is my squaw there?" "Yes, and she is the best dancer among them." Without making a reply he arose and strode into the crowd, and seizing his wife, forcibly dragged her into the tent. "Now do your duty--go and bring me some water." The reply of the irritated squaw was characteristic of a freeborn woman. "I am no slave--if you have one, send her." Without reply, Jim seized his hatchet and clove her skull, and she fell a lifeless corpse before him. Turning to the whites, with the utmost coolness he observed, "Now you must fight or die; you'll soon hear," and he took down his rifle, knife, pistols and tomahawk, and calmly set down by the fire.
</p><p>
In the meantime, two or three women who witnessed the occurrence ran out screaming and soon explained the state of affairs within. In a moment the yelling orgies without ceased--there was an appalling stillness which contrasted strangely with the horrid din that had shaken the ground. "Aha!" ejaculated Jim, "do you hear that?" Directly the thunder of the terrific warwhoop was sounded. The stoutest heart might have quailed and the faces of the Frenchmen grew pale as they reflected that they were surrounded by hundreds of desperate and revengeful Indians, who formed a circle around the lodge. Escape was impossible, and death seemed inevitable. The yell was repeated. "I told you so," said Jim recklessly. "It is for life now, men, and little chance for that." "Why did you kill her, Jim?" the white men asked with a shudder. "I told her," he replied, "that I never rejoiced at the death of a white man--I never will, and no squaw of mine shall do so. I forbade her to do it, and she disobeyed me."
</p><p>
At the very moment in which they expected the rush upon them to be made, the door was opened, and the father of the murdered squaw entered alone, and silently gazing upon her remains for a few moments, quietly sat down by her murderer. "My son, why did you do this--why did you kill my daughter?" "She disobeyed me," replied Jim fearlessly. "She forgot her duty." A pause ensued. At length silence was broken by the old man. "My son, you did right. I want all my foolish children dead. She had no ears--she should have obeyed you. I have another girl--she has ears and will hear you. You shall have her for a wife, and she will obey you. Take her and use her well."
</p><p>
Savage as the act was, Jim had only exercised an Indian prerogative, and he actually married another daughter of the old man. Notwithstanding the matter was thus compromised, Jim well knew that as he belonged to another tribe, her friends would revenge her death
at some convenient opportunity, and after remaining in the lodge a few days he determined to try to reach his own tribe. The old man selected a guard who were pledged to protect him to a certain point on the way and then give him the start of them about six miles before they pursued him, if they were determined to kill him. They obeyed the instructions, and Jim started off. As soon as they reached the point of his final departure, they stopped, and as soon as he was out of sight, he ran with all his might, for he knew too well what his fate would be if they overtook him. By almost superhuman exertions, he succeeded in outrunning them and in about three days reached the Crows in safety.

He is now in California, and I am told is waiting for the snows to melt on the mountains, when he starts as a bearer of dispatches to some of the distant inland posts. His has been a life of impetuous daring, and this is only one of the many stories which are related of him.
</p><p>
The waters are slowly subsiding, and people are leaving the Valley in crowds for the mines. I go up to work on my claim next week.
