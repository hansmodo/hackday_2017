Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Your favour of the third instant came to hand this 
morning. The satisfaction my letter afforded you flatters 
as well as pleases me. It argues a remembrance of former 
times ; for which, and other reasons, I shall give you no 
more opportunities of joining the assembly of angels in 
rejoicing over penitent mortals. Not that I mean on the 
one hand to enter the state of reprobation and become a 
hardened sinner, or on the other enlist with those saints who 
slip not with their foot. 
This letter, written on the very day I received yours, 
will become evidence of my having gone through the 
whole process of amendment. Divines, you know, describe 
it as consisting of conviction, contrition, and conversion. 
Whether I shall persevere or not is a subject on which lime 
will utter the surest prophecies. 
</p><p>
The complexions of resignation, of soft complaint, and 
joyless sensibility, are so blended in your letter, that if 
anonymous, one would suppose it written by a wayworn 
traveller through this vale of tears, who, journeying towards 
his distant haven through sultry and dreary paths, at length 
lays his languid limbs under some friendly shade, and permits the effusions of his soul to escape in words. My 
friend, a mind unbraced and nerves relaxed are not fit company for each other. It was not a man whom the poet tells 
us pined in thought, and sat like patience on a monument 
smiling at grief. In such rugged times as these other sensations are to be cherished. Rural scenes, domestic bliss, 
and the charming group of pleasures found in the train of 
peace, fly at the approach <>!' war, and are seldom to be 
found in Melds stained with blood, or habitations polluted by 
outrage and desolation. 1 admire your sensibility, nor 
would I wish to see less milk in your veins ; you would be 
less amiable. In my opinion, however, your reasoning is 
not quite just. I think a man's happiness requires that he 
should condescend to keep himself free from fleas and 
wasps, as well as from thieves and robbers. 
</p><p>
When the present session of your Legislature is ended, 
take a ride and see us. You will find many here happy to 
see you. I have something, though not very interesting, to 
say to you on the subject of politics, but as it is now very 
late, and I have been writing letters constantly since dinner, 
I am really too much fatigued to proceed. Make my compliments to Mrs. Livingston, who I presume is with you. 
Adieu. I am, your friend, 
</p><p>
