</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your predecessor and yourself are furnished with all the documents of form. To him have been sent letters of recall ; to you 
have been delivered your commission and letters of credence to 
the Stadtholder and States-General. You are also possessed of a cypher. 
</p><p>
Although the general history of a country, and its Constitution 
will necessarily attract the attention of a minister and of the 
government, from which he goes ; yet is it not only superfluous 
to recommend to you the acquisition of subjects already known 
to you, but we can also dispense with any special communications 
upon them. However, if even concerning them, it should appear 
that the books, from which our knowledge of the United Nether 
lands is derived, go beyond or fall short of the truth, it will be expected, that these observations should be noted to us. If, too, the 
germ of any important change should be foreseen, it will be honor 
able to yourself, and may be advantageous to the United States 
to apprize us of it, as early as possible. 
</p><p>
The administration indeed of the Dutch government is not only 
liable to the fluctuations, which the administration of every 
government undergoes, from the passions and views of individuals 
at the helm of affairs ; but the peculiar situation of Holland in 
relation to the present European war lays it open to the chance of 
sudden revolutions, and very sudden and new courses of policy. 
</p><p>
These and every other interesting occurrences will be marked 
with care, and forwarded to the Secretary of State. Among 
other things, which may be contemplated, as worthy of observation ; if any symptom of increasing liberty, of dissatisfaction 
with any of the combined powers, or of an inclination to make 
peace with the French Republic should be found, you will hasten 
to us the intelligence of them. 
</p><p>
It will be at least a matter of curiosity to understand, in what 
light the existing armed neutrality between Sweden and Denmark 
is considered at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, after the part, which Holland took 
in the former system. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding we have ministers and consuls in other parts of 
Europe; yet if you should obtain any very interesting intelligence 
from countries not lying within your immediate functions, it will 
be acceptable to receive it, even with the probability of some in 
accuracy. The movements of the northern French armies may 
continue to be in your neighborhood, and early opportunities from 
France being cut off, we are dependent upon British prints for the 
first breaking of French events. 
</p><p>
Our treaty with Holland l being the basis of our commercial 
intercourse, you will do well to inquire into the operations of every 
stipulation; and as it is a great desideratum in our political archives, that we have no authentic tables of our commerce in 
detail with different nations, it will be an essential service to 
collect minute statements of it with Holland. You understand too 
well to be in need of an enumeration, what are the points in which 
foreign commerce is valuable. To these therefore you will particularly turn your mind ; and if our commerce can be relieved from 
any burthens, or promoted by any exertions of the Executive 
or Legislature ; you will put it in our power by proper and reason 
able representations. The only thing which now occurs upon this 
head is, that our treaty is interpreted not to suffer American 
Consuls to be introduced into the Dutch Islands in our vicinity. 
Mr. Van Berckel the Resident of the United Netherlands here, has been called upon to explain and to rectify the wrong ; but I can 
obtain no written answer to two letters, which I have addressed to 
him; the reason of which I presume from a conversation to be, 
that he has no authority to enter into any adjustment. You will 
therefore let this business be discussed ; as we entertain little 
doubt, that Consuls of the United States ought to be admitted in 
all the Dutch territories. 
</p><p>
The employment of your predecessor has hitherto consisted in 
the management of Loans, which belong to the Treasury Department. That therefore is the channel, through which you will 
receive the will of the President in the article of money. 
</p><p>
But I must intreat and urge you, to make it your first and unremitting duty, to forward by all the means in your power the 
loan opened for 800,000 dollars and destined to the ransom of 
our fellow citizens in Algiers, and the effectuating of a peace. 
Our bankers in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> have been commissioned for accomplishing it, from the inevitable delay in your departure from hence. 
The Secretary of the Treasury, however, will lead you into those 
measures which may contribute to the advancement of the object. 
</p><p>
Our Consuls in Holland and in the countries, convenient to 
your residence are the following : James Greenleaf, consul, and 
Sylvanus Bourne, vice consul, for the port of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, John 
Parish, consul for Hamburgh, and Arnold Delius, consul for 
Bremen. They are under general instructions to correspond with 
you, and as soon as arrangements concerning consuls and vice 
consuls, which are scattered in different instructions shall be 
reduced into one body, a copy of them shall be transmitted to 
you. . . . 
</p><p>
From you, Sir, I ask a communication by every opportunity. 
The Executive having been under some inconvenience on that 
score, it is the wish and instruction of the President, that a memorandum be daily taken of every circumstance, which may be 
deemed proper for his information, and a letter commenced and 
continued, so as to be ready for conclusion and sealing, upon a 
moment's warning of a conveyance. . . . 
</p><p>
As you have a right to correspond with the ministry of the nation, 
near which you reside, in your own language, you will not lose 
this advantage. . . . 
</p><p>
