Dear Brother: My hand is still very sore but I am 
able to write some. 'The newspapers came back to us 
with accounts of our battle of the 6th and 7th inst. as 
usual made by people who ran away and had to excuse 
their cowardice by charging bad management on the part 
of leaders.^ I see that we were surprised, that our men 
were bayoneted in their tents, that officers had not had 
breakfast, &c. This is all simply false. The attack did 
not begin until 7 3-4 A.M. All but the worthless cowards 
had had breakfast. Not a man was bayoneted in or 
near his tent. Indeed our brigade surgeon, Hartshorn, 
has not yet seen a single bayonet wound on a living or 
dead subject. The regiments that profess to have been 
surprised lost no officers at all, and of the two that first 
broke in my division 53 and 57 Ohio, the 53 lost no officers and only 7 men, the 57 two officers and 7 men. 
Some of my Ohio regiments that did fight well lost as 
many as 49 and 34, but not a bayonet, sword or knife 
wound, all cannon and musket ball. Those of my brigade held our original position from 7 3-4 A.M. when the 
attack began, until 10 h. 10 m. when the enemy had 
passed my left and got artillery to enfilade my line 
when I ordered them to fall back. We held our second 
position until 4 P.M. and then fell back without opposition to the third and last position, more than a mile from 
the river. 
</p><p>
As to surprise, we had constant skirmishes with the 
enemies' cavalry all the week before, and I had strong 
guards out in front of each brigade, which guards were 
driven in on the morning of the battle, but before the 
enemy came within cannon range of my position every 
regiment was under arms at the post I had previously 
assigned to them. The cavalry was saddled and artillery 
harnessed up, unlimbered, and commenced firing as soon 
as we could see anything to fire at. 
</p><p>
On Saturday I had no cavalry pickets out because I 
had no cavalry in my division. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> had made 
a new assignment of cavalry and artillery on Friday. 
The Ohio Fifth which had been with me was ordered to 
Hurlburt, and eight companies of the fourth, III., Colonel 
Dickey, assigned to me did not get into camp till near 
Saturday night and I ordered them into the saddle at 
midnight. 
</p><p>
I occupied the right front, McClernand was to my 
rear, and on his left in echelon with me was Prentiss. I 
watched the Rondy road and main <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a>, Prentiss the 
Ridge <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a> road. . . . 
</p><p>
The enemy did not carry either of my roads until he 
had driven Prentiss and got in on my left. . . . 
</p><p>
Whether we should have been on this or that side of 
the Tennessee river is not my business. I did not apprehend an attack from Beauregard because I thought then 
and think now he would have done better if he could 
have chosen ground as far back from our stores as possible. We are bound to attack him, and had we run out 
of cartridges or stores or got stampeded twenty miles 
back from the Tennessee the result would have been different from now. But we knew the enemy was in our 
front, but in what form could not tell, and I was always 
ready for an attack. I am out of all patience that our 
people should prefer to believe the horrid stories of 
butchery, ridiculous in themselves, gotten up by cowards 
to cover their shame, than the plain natural reports of 
the officers who are responsible and who saw what they 
describe. My report with all the subordinate reports of 
Brigadiers and Colonels with lists of killed and wounded 
and missing went to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> on the llth. 
</p><p>
The enemy is still in our front, we can get a fight the 
hour and minute we want it. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a>, Buell, Grant all 
in authority are now here and responsibility cannot be 
shifted. f~The common soldiers and subordinates ran 
away and now want to blame the commanders. . . ^j 
Your affectionate brother,
