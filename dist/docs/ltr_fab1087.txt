Christmas I spent part of the day in the Catholic Church in Barclay Street, looking at the mummeries going on and the rest of it eating a good dinner. In the evening it snowed hard and we promised ourselves a sleigh ride but there was not enough. It has been warm as spring all the week. I have heard of London fogs but I think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> can beat it. For four days we have not seen across the run but had to go by ringing a bell. Sometimes it would come down so thick that you could not see across the street. New Year's Day was foggy and muddy but otherwise it did very well. By eleven o'clock the streets were filled with callers. I made a most elaborate toilet for me (for you know I seldom get dressed). I even cased my hands in kid gloves, mounted a white vest and started. Saw some very pretty girls. Said all the fine things I knew, drank one glass of wine, any quantity of coffee and lemonade. The young ladies looked charming, dressed in white and kids. The gentlemen looked muddy except the 'Upper Ten' who went in carriages. To give you an idea of the business done: one young lady where I called about eight in the evening said she had over two hundred calls and they had drank 8 gallons of coffee. Mrs. Price is famed for her coffee, to say nothing of her daughter. I called on Folsom's wife and Mary. She likes it here very much. Mrs. H. Pond inquired for you, also Capt. Powers and
about twenty more whom you know nothing about and then came home sober, which is more than any one I saw can say, for of all the revelling that ever I heard the scenes in Broadway about eleven, beat it. Every lamp post was ornamented with some poor fellow and serenades were very frequent. New Year's Day is observed more than any other day here. Everybody gives themselves up to pleasure. No business is done at all. I like the custom of calling very much. Why don't you introduce it at Bucksport. I really pity you about your singing but I can tell you the secret. You can't expect good singing unless you are willing to pay for it and that they have never done. The poorest churches here pay their organist at least $150.00 a year and he finds two good singers. The Pilgrims pay $800 and the church in B. are certainly able to pay something. Why don't they send out and hire some public female singer. Tell the church for $500 I will agree to find an organist and two female singers. Mary Taylor, the actress, gets only $250 for singing at St. Luke's. Perhaps you might get her and then you could have a theatre during the week besides. I should think you would want something for an excitement.
