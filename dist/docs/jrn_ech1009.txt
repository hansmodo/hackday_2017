Tuesday, February 12th, we were landed with our baggage on the beach at a place called Happy Valley, about a mile east of the city, where we soon cleared a place and put up our tent and removed our trunks and bedding into it. We then cooked our supper of tea and fried bread, and although this meal was quite humble and prepared by our own hands, I never partook of any that I enjoyed more, not even the best cured fowl. Being determined to have as lively a time of it as circumstances would permit, we soon after introduced the violin and enjoyed ourselves in the giddy mazes of a real Spanish fandango for an hour or two. About nine o'clock we arranged our trunks and placed our beds upon them. Two of our party had to lie upon the ground, but Atkins and I had trunks enough to form a platform for our beds. We then turned in without a single weapon by us, they all being locked up in our trunks, feeling quite as secure as when surrounded by thick and massive walls, and enjoyed as good a night's repose.

Happy Valley seems to derive its name from the merry character of its citizens who all live in tents, doing their own cooking and washing, and sleeping on the ground. The ground is owned by the government and is reserved for a navy yard. Several fine springs of excellent water are quite convenient and wood is
obtained for the cutting close by. We are surrounded by a great number of tents occupied by persons from all parts of the Union.

My comrade and I have rambled the city from center to circumference in search of Mr. Jonathan Griffith, to whom we had letters of introduction from Judge Strickland of West Chester. At length we found him and he gave us a most welcome reception and treated us with great hospitality. We were not long enquiring about our friends and learned that a few of them were in the city, not more than paying expenses, while the greater number were at the diggings where they had been almost ever since their arrival. At the last accounts Mr. Griffith had from them, they had done but little in the way of making money.

Whitaker had been taken ill at the mines and sent to this place with sufficient funds to winter, and recruit his health if possible. But, alas! A melancholy tale must now be told. Poor Whitaker grew worse and worse and had to be removed to the hospital. After suffering there for some time, he at length yielded his spirit up to his Maker, never uttering a murmur against his hard fate. And thus died a young man who a few months before had been filled with the brightest hopes for the future. He was young, intelligent, amiable, kind and gentle, industrious and enterprising. He was beloved, respected and esteemed by all who knew him, and was never guilty of a mean action. His body was interred at the public burying-ground a little to the west of the city, near the seashore, where the howling wind and roaring surf will sing him a suitable requiem.

But his is the case of thousands. Every neighborhood in the States will yet have to hear of the bones of some of their best beloved and respected young citizens
bleaching on the plains of California. A bitter wail of lament will be echoed from house to house, by parents, wives, brothers, sisters and lovers, the anguish of which cannot be repaid by all the glittering ore that covers every hill and valley in this new El Dorado, this Land of Promise. Thousands will curse the day that brought them to this golden land. The gold will be a curse instead of a blessing.
