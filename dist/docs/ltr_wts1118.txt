HON. S. CAMERON, Secretary of War : 
</p><p>
Dear Sir : I hold myself now, as always, prepared to 
serve my country in the capacity for which I was trained. 
</p><p>
I did not and will not volunteer for three months, because 
I cannot throw my family on the cold support of charity, 
but for the three years' call made by the President an 
officer could prepare his command and do good service. 
I will not volunteer, because, rightfully or wrongfully, I 
feel myself unwilling to take a mere private's place, and 
having for many years lived in California and Louisiana, 
the men are not well enough acquainted with me to elect 
me to my appropriate place. Should my services be 
needed, the Eecord or the War Department will enable 
you to designate the station in which I can render best 
service. 
</p><p>
Yours truly, 
</p><p>
