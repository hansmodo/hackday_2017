Dear General, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 4th of July, 
and cannot avoid feeling most sensibly the neglect 
or want of resources, to enable your Excellency, and 
those who have the honor of commanding under you, 
to act offensively against the enemy. I am happy, 
however, to find that our good allies afford us aid, 
and have a happy presage that, with the smiles of 
divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, your Excellency will be enabled 
to drive the enemy out of our country. 
</p><p>
The French inhabitants at Detroit are much in our 
interest, and wish most heartily to see an American 
force approaching. I really believe that twelve hundred well-appointed men would carry that place without great difficulty, and I wish for nothing more, 
when circumstances will admit, than the honor of 
making the attempt. The whole garrison, with sergeants to lead them, came to my quarters, a few 
days ago, to represent that they had not received 
any bread for five days together. Their conduct was 
civil and respectful, and, upon being told that every 
possible exertion was making to prevent their further 
suffering, they retired in good order to their quarters. 
</p><p>
I make use of every fair method, and sometimes a little compulsion, to obtain a temporary supply. But, 
with my best endeavours, I am very apprehensive Tve shall be great sufferers before your requisitions 
are complied with. Both Gamble and Davis, who 
were under sentence of death, and who well deserved 
their fate, have been suffered to make their escape 
out of the guard-house, although they were ironed 
on hands and feet. I ordered the officers, who commanded the guards, under arrest for neglect of duty. 
One of them is tried and acquitted; the other remains to be tried. Colonel Gibson was appointed 
President of the General Court-Martial, ordered by 
your Excellency, and the same court remains until 
it is your pleasure to dissolve it. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. I have taken the liberty to inclose an extract from a letter I lately received from the Reverend Mr. Ileckewelder. Two Indians, who were sent 
from the Moravian towns, with messages to Sandusky, 
report that almost all the Wyandot party, consisting 
of thirty old warriors, were killed and wounded by 
the party sent to attack them.
