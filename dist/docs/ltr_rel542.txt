Mr. Joseph Topham, Cincinnati, Ohio.

My Dear Sir:  I have just received your letter of the 17th inst.,
in reference to a history of the late war to be written by myself.
I cannot, at present, undertake such a work, but am endeavouring to
collect certain material to enable me to write a history of the
campaigns in Virginia.  Its completion is uncertain, and dependent
upon so many contingencies that I think it useless to speak of
arrangements for its publication at present.  Thanking you for your
kind proposition, I am,
</p><p>
                     Very respectfully yours,
</p><p>
                                  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee</a>.
