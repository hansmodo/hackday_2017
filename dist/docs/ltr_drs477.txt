Dear Friend --
</p><p>
   Your note (for it is
too short to be called a letter) of the
18th came duly to hand, being
forwarded from Winfield.
</p><p>
    We left that place on the 9th
of May. We remained a week at
Gauley Bridge, when we proceeded
to this place. We expected an attack when we first arrived from
Humphrey Marshall who was
reported coming on the [unclear: Loagan
Road] with a considerable force.
</p><p>
    We immediately commenced fortifying but up to this time all
is quiet. The only force here at
present is our regiment and about
100 Cavalry. The balance of our
Brigade is at Lewisburg. Gen. Cox's forces are at Flat Top Mountain, 19 miles from here. Our Brigade consists of the 11th, 36th, 44th
and 47th Ohio Regiments and Simmons'
Battery and under the command of
Col. Crook (acting Brig. Gen.)
</p><p>
   I do not know how long we
shall remain here. We are to be
mustered and paid this week, and
I suppose we shall sooner after
move somewhere. I am begin=
ning to be habituated to a soldier's life,
but the thought often comes
across my mind that I am not
learning anything useful and forgetting what little I do know. --
</p><p>
    I hope the war will close in
time for me to [ come] go to Pennsyl
vania to help you cut some of
/that fruit you are bragging of. Tell
the Governor to put up plenty of cider as I shall be a frequent visitor [ this summer] next winter.
It is singular you have nothing to write. Of course I do not
expect to hear important war
news, but there is certainly something to write. How is your duck?
How is my duck? How are the
ducks generally? How are the
male sex? Is anyone commit
ting matrimony? &c. &c. etc. etc.
Dou have any fun? Are any
of our old friends in the army?
Good Lord! if I were in there
writing a letter to myself I could
fill six sheets of foolscap. -- -
</p><p>
    My case is different. I am the
only person in the regiment & of
course you are not particular about
thare welfare. The war news you
can learn much better from the
papers than I can communicate.
</p><p>
   As I have met with no important personal adventures lately, I must now close for want of matter to write.
</p><p>
   Give my respects to your family and friends.
</p><p>
    Hoping soon to hear from you.
</p><p>
   I remain
</p><p>
Respectfully yours
</p><p>

P.S. Your offer to pay the postage
on this letter comes in quite con=
venient, just now. I always
manage to have a little loose
change in my pocket, but just
at this time there are no postage
stamps in the place. And the
Quarter Master is not authorised
to take money, so I had to let him
frank it.

Direct your letter thus<br/>
