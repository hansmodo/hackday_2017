About noon on Wednesday, the 15th instant, we took up the line of march expecting to go to the Tuolumne Diggings. But after going some distance the teams concluded to go on down to
<p></p>
Stockton, then send out two men to the mines and ascertain if they were worth going to, while the remainder of us would stop in camp near town. The weather being warm and the roads very dusty, we proceeded but slowly in dust ankle deep, while the vertical sun poured his heated rays upon us. We encamped the first night on a small, running stream about six miles from Mariposa. On that evening we did not pitch our tent, for the first time since we have been in the country, but spread out our blankets upon Mother Earth and lay down with a rock for a pillow and the starry heavens for a canopy. Although some of the nights have been extremely cool on our way down, we have not set up our tent during the whole journey, a distance of some 120 to 130 miles.
<p></p>
We had plenty of water until we passed the Merced River, which we crossed at Water's Ferry on Friday, the morning of the third day's march. Here the ferry man told me that I could obtain water along the road at convenient distances, so I did not fill my canteen. We had a long parched tract of rolling prairie land, of some twenty-three miles, to cross, and I did not find any water until we came to a stagnant pool known in the country as Dry Lake. This lake was hemmed in on all sides by high hills and as there was no outlet, the water was warm and slimy. But notwithstanding this, being very thirsty, I lay down and heartily drank something less than a barrel. As a consequence, as I suppose, of this imprudence, I nearly died with the colic on Sunday. A young acquaintance and I were pushing forward, our rifles slung over our shoulders, driving a cow and calf, and we reached the next river, the Tuolumne, at twilight on Saturday evening, an
hour or two in advance of the teams. Here we drank freely of the river water which was cool as ice, coming as it did from the snow mountains.
<p></p>
When the teams came up, it was discovered that my companion, Atkins, was missing. He had not been seen for some time with the teams, and I at once concluded he had taken sick and given out, and after procuring a bottle of good cool river water to carry to him, I started back and met him after going about a mile. He had taken sick and become much exhausted for water, and had been lying by the roadside for some time, expecting I would be back after him.
<p></p>
Just as Mr. Cox reached the Tuolumne River at Jackson's ranch, one of the wheels of his wagon gave out, and on Sunday we lay there in a camp, in order to repair the damages.
<p></p>
On Monday morning when we were ready to cross the river we were informed that the ferry rope had broken and we could not cross until near evening. In the evening we crossed the river, but it was too late to go on to the next water, so we were compelled to remain overnight. The next day we intended to go to the Stanislaus River, but before we had proceeded far, the tire came off two of the wheels of Mr. Hilliard's wagon and we were able to go only as far as Dry Creek, very aptly called, for in its bed we found only here and there a small pond of warm stagnant water.
<p></p>
We crossed the Stanislaus at Islip's Ferry the next day and proceeded to the Love Tree, making twenty-two miles, where we remained overnight. I fell in with Mr. Alex. F. Platt of Newcastle, Delaware, an old shipmate, and through him heard of many others. He was going up to Savage's Creek where his companions were. Yesterday we travelled about 23 miles
and encamped near Stockton a little while before sundown. I was very tired and had many blisters, each as large as a bit, on my feet. On our way Mr. Cox was lucky enough to kill two antelopes and we fared sumptuously on the meat. The country is filled with reptiles of all kinds and we killed a great many lizards and rattlesnakes.
<p></p>
The agricultural capacities of California have been greatly overrated, for here is a vast tract of country, eighty miles long and fifty wide, no better than a burning desert, scarcely affording sufficient coarse herbage to feed the teams that are crossing over it. No crop could grow upon it without irrigation and the rivers are so situated that it can never be irrigated.
<p></p>
We have now hardly money enough to keep us a week. We are hard up, not having five dollars at our command, yet I feel nowise disheartened or discouraged, but hope to make a few dollars this summer. I walked to Stockton this morning and proceeded to the Times office, hoping to meet my friend, Caleb Thornbury, but I was informed that he had gone up to Trinity. I asked for employment but they had hands enough. I then proceeded to the express office of Bryan & Co. and have sent for my letters and papers at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>.
<p></p>
Atkins is still too sick to work. But rich or poor as long as he is sick I shall stick by him and it shall never be said of me that I deserted a friend when health and fortune failed.
