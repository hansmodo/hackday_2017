Tonight I found on my table a letter from General Benton dated on the 6th instant. When it was placed there by my messenger I do not know. There was a large mass of papers and letters on my table to which I have had no time to give any attention, such have been my pressing engagements. This, with many other letters with the seals unbroken, was among the number. On opening it I found that the conditions on which General Benton would accept the appointment of Major-General of the army, which I had conferred upon him by and with the advice of the Senate, were, 1st, that he should have the chief command of the army in Mexico, and 2d, that he should be invested with plenary diplomatic powers to conclude a treaty of peace. Shortly after I opened this letter the Secretary of State called in and I sent for the Secretary of War. I had fully examined my authority under the existing law and was satisfied that I possessed no power to assign the chief command of the army on General Benton, unless it was by recalling four senior Major-Generals, viz., Scott, Taylor, Butler, and Patterson. The two former I should have no hesitation in recalling, but I know of no reason to justify the recall of the two latter. The Secretaries of State and War  concurred in this opinion. . . After these gentlemen retired I drew up the draft of a letter to General Benton, expressing the opinion that I was not invested with the power by the existing law to assign him, a junior Major-General, to the chief command, without superseding the senior generals of the same rank. General Benton's letter was in a kind and friendly spirit and the draft of my answer was in the same spirit. The truth is that if Congress at the late session had conferred upon me the power to designate a General-inChief, as I asked them to do, I should have selected General Benton for that important command.
