My Dear Brother : Your letter dated July 19, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=jackson" rel="city">Jackson</a>, is received. '"What you say about the injustice of 
the press was undoubtedly true a month ago, but it is 
true no longer Since the fall of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> each of the 
officers named by you has been very highly lauded, and 
that by all parties and papers. With you it has been 
especially laudatory. 'Even your old enemy, the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> "Gazette," has in several recent numbers spoken of 
you in very complimentary terms, and without any apparent recollection that it has libelled you for months. 
With the officers of the army you stand very high. Indeed it is now unnecessary for you to care for defenders. 
I will think of your proposition to visit <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, and 
will probably do so this fall. At present I am involved 
in the political canvass now going on in Ohio, but shall 
not be long. My position does not require me to take a 
very active part. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
