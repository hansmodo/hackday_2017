We left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">CINCINNATI</a> on the twenty-ninth ultimo, 
having been strengthened by fifty recruits from the 
depot at Newport. We were exceedingly fortunate 
in getting down the river (Ohio) without accident, 
the water being very low; reached Cairo Monday 
afternoon the first, and were there employed until 
three o clock Tuesday morning in unloading and reloading a large down-river boat " Metamora " with 
our baggage. Finally, after a most dreadful night of 
heat, stench, and confusion, we were prepared to commence our voyage. We parted with General Brooke 
at this point. Poor old man ! he was sad enough. 
We gave him three hearty cheers as his boat parted 
from ours. He waved his cap in farewell, but seemed 
unable to speak, and turned immediately into his state 
room.

The Lower Mississippi retains very much the character of the Upper; the water is, however, muddy, 
and the banks below Natchez leveed and thickly 
sprinkled with plantations. As you approach New 
Orleans they are continuous. We could see the tops 
of the sugar cane waving in the breeze for many miles. 
We arrived at the city about three o clock on the 
seventh, an intensely hot day.

Marcy, the acting Assistant Quarter-Master, was 
quite sick, threatened with fever, and could not go on 
shore, so I was compelled to do his duty besides my 
own. However, in two hours I had completed my 
business with the Department Quarter-Master General 
and came down to the barracks three miles below the 
town, and we were landed and in quarters by eight in 
the evening. This post is by far the most beautiful 
I have ever seen. The quarters are fine and airy, completely protected from the sun by beautiful tropical shade trees, with extensive yards and gardens about 
them, and a large shaded parade ground clothed with 
a rich greensward.

I have arranged my transportation, and we shall 
leave in the steamship "Alabama" for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Corpus Christi" rel="city">Corpus Christi</a>, 
tomorrow morning.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Corpus Christi" rel="city">Corpus Christi</a> is represented by every one as the 
most delightful spot on the globe, cool, healthy, no 
insects, not a mosquito, an abundance of oysters, 
fish, and venison, but unfortunately no wood to cook 
with. We shall, barring accident, or Mexican privateers, reach there by the fourteenth. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> 
has now in his camp near three thousand regular 
troops, and a considerable body of volunteers. He 
will soon have five thousand regulars and will, it is 
thought, be amply strong for any force the Mexicans 
can send against him. We leave most of our baggage 
here, going into the field light and ready for active 
service. Mrs. Kelly (wife of a soldier) is cooking and 
washing for Rossell and myself, and we expect to 
get on with great economy. No sickness in New 
Orleans, not a case of yellow fever. My own health 
was never better. I have gained every hour since I 
started.
