My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your several welcome & interesting letters of the 9th 12th  19th  & 20th 
ult accompanied by a number of slips cut from various papers which go 
very far to show the state of the public mind at the present moment as 
regards the election for the next president, in addition to several news 
papers, the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> Journal among the number were duly rec d some by 
yesterdays mail, & others several days previous, for all of which you have 
my sincere thanks. It was a source of much real pleasure to me, to 
learn from your several letters up to your last, that all was well including 
yourself & family at Baton Rouge when last heard from there ; also that 
you had heard from John, who had reached his place of destination with 
out accident, & I truly hope ere this has passed his examination with 
credit, & entered on the duties of his profession ; which he will find of a 
very rough character for several years to come, which industry, persever 
ance & resolution will overcome. 1 I was likewise much gratified to find 
that Dick had at last gone to the Arkensas springs & sincerely hope he 
will be greatly improved in health by bathing & drinking the waters there, 
if he is not entirely restored 
</p><p>
I deeply regret to learn from you that Col Davis wound is likely to 
prove so tedious in getting well, I had hoped it would have healed or 
nearly so by the time he reached the city; but from what you say I much 
fear it will give him much trouble as well as subject him to great inconvenience, before he gets the perfect use of the limb. I have not heard 
whether he will accept or not the appt recently conferred on him of Brg r 
Gen or turn his attention to political matters; I have written him to consult his interest & inclination before he committed himself in respect to 
either. From Graysons letter, as well as other signs of the times, I think 
it not unlikely we will have peace by or during the month of August; if 
we do not there is no telling when this war will terminate ; but I hope for 
the best. I am glad you conversations with Gen Pillow were of a Gen 
character, he is I consider a very small man in every respect, but I apprehend has the ear of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a>, as well as that of some of his advisers; 
& he carried on a confidential correspondence with those dignitaries ; it is 
no doubt most advisable to treat him & others of similar character with 
courtesy & politeness without committing oneself with them, in any way 
The letters & packages forwarded by Dr Abadie were duly rec d the 
D r reached the Brazos in safety, & will be assigned to duty perhaps at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> 
</p><p>
I presume Mr s Taylor & Betty have left before this for their respect 
ive homes, I hope you were able to make their time pass pleasantly while 
they remained.

Without being decided fine, I imagine the likenesses painted of me 
by Mr Alwood are tolerable; the one which has been just finished by a 
Mr Brown froMrichmond is said by those who understand or are judges 
of such matters to be a much better painting; Mr B. has nearly completed 
a group of officers, myself & staff in addition to several others, which I 
imagine will be considered a good painting by connoisseurs ; he is now 
engaged in making a painting describing the battle ground of Buena Vista; 
it is uncertain when he will complete them, but I suppose for the most 
part will do so in 8 or ten days, when he will return from whence he came, 
stopping a short time in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, where they may be exhibited, if so 
you no doubt will examine them with Ann & can then judge as to the 
merits of both 
</p><p>
On the subject of the presidency I do not feel my inclination for that 
high office in the least to increase ; on the contrary as the election 
approaches I find my repugnance to meddling in the matter to be on the 
increase, & alth I suppose I must serve if elected, I would have preferred 
some other individuals I could name for said office who I would prefer 
seeing there to myself, could it be so; & I consider much more credit due 
an individual who declines an office created for the benefit of others, when 
he doubts his qualifications to fill it which is my case than to court it in 
any way ; I shall very soon become the target at which all the aspirants 
will open their fire on, through or from countless newspapers, with the 
Union among them but this gives me but little concern, as I do not intend 
to be driven from the position I have taken at any rate for the present, 
which is to enter into no explanations as to my political creed, nor give 
any pledges to what I will do in certain contingencies, other than to support the constitution as near as practicable, as was construed by our first 
chief magistrates, who had so large a share in creating & putting it in 
motion. I am now satisfied was the election to come off tomorrow or 
even next Nov r I would be elected by an overwhelming majority; but 
things may greatly change between now & Nov r <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a>, nothing being more 
uncertain & fluctuating than popular favor; but I am, & intend to keep 
in that position that it will not produce the slightest mortification should 
some one else be selected at the time of holding the election for the 
office

We have no positive news from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> since about the time 
Grayson wrote, or perhaps a few days after which stated that his column 
would leave Puebla for the City of Mexico about the 14th  ult but 
whether or not it done so, we have nothing certain in regard to it ; we 
are looking for news from that quarter with the greatest anxiety, & 
hope that ere now some arrangements have taken so far at least as to prepare the way for opening negotiations, which will lead to the amicable 
adjustment of all difficulties between the two countries. I had but little 
doubt the placing me under the orders of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> was done with the 
hope & expectation of mortifying me, but I shall remain passive as regards such contemplated assaults if intended as such or in fact of any 
kind as long as it can be done ; even if the war continues I hope to go 
out the first of Nov r which will be soon at hand. Let matters eventuate 
as they may I hardly expect to have a force sufficient placed under my 
orders to authorize my making a forward movement ; my command will 
be on paper, or a considerable of it. By referring to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>s sugared 
letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> & which was marked unofficial, but which by accident or design found its way into the Union when it was supposed I 
had been annihilated by Santa Anna which was done to reconcile my 
friends to having my throat cut or to relieve the Secretary of War & 
his friend the Gen from anything like censure for withdrawing from me 
so large a portion of my force ; in which he the Gen stated that I had 
already done enough ; this was before the battle of Buena Vista, after 
said battle there cannot be a doubt but those two individuals in addition 
to some others, conceived I had not only done enough but quite too 
much ; & I hardly think I will be placed in a situation to accomplish 
anything of importance ; among the troops now on this line there is 
much sickness & some deaths in several of the regt s while others are 
comparatively healthy. A considerable portion of the new Volunteers on 
paper, who are to compose a part of my command, appear to be very 
slow in reaching the Brazos ; & letters have been rec d here stating in 
some of the states men to serve on foot in Mexico could not be raised. 
I shall however be constantly on my guard, as regards making my 
opinions known either by letter or in any other way in which they can 
be misrepresf.nted, & I hope my friends will do the same 
</p><p>
I am heartily tired of inaction, in which state I have been kept for 
the last three months & more & if the war is to be continued I would 
like to do somewhat if ever so little to aid in bringing it to a close. 
Had I been permitted to have done so, I would very much liked to 
have led one of the columns against the City of Mexico, but the powers 
that be determined otherwise, & I must submit in the best way I can ; 
but if I have not done so it is no fault of mine which I hope will be 
understood by the community at large ; but those who control my move 
ments think I have done enough I feel some anxiety about Ann & 
the children remaining at the Barracks during the summer & autumn ; 
but should it become unhealthy or any contageous disease should make 
its appearance, you could in one day send your family to some healthy 
place on the lakes where they would be completely out of danger

I was pleased to hear that Puss was about to return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> to 
go to school, as she ought to lose no time in getting through with her 
education which I hope when completed will be a substantial one. I 
trust she will go up with Betty Bety writes that Bob is with his 
grandmother & goes to school which he does very regular. We have 
nothing of interest in this quarter My love to Ann & the children 
& regards to Cap 1 & Mr s Juett if the latter is with him & accept my best 
wishes for the continued health & prosperity of you & yours through life. 
</p><p>
Your Friend Truly 
</p><p>
& Sincerely

I was gratified to find the blunder I committed in relation to the 
drafts had been arranged without difficulty
