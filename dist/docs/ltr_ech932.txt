My Ellen:--Your letter of the 5th of March reached me at Mariposa Diggings on the 9th instant. It was the first and only one I have received from your pen since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. I had hoped to hear from you by each express which went down to the steamer. Oh, how I could have blessed the paper your hand had travelled over. I never retire to my humble bed without thinking of my Ellen and hoping that she is happy.
</p><p>
Your letter told me of many interesting things, none of which I drank with more pleasure than the assurance of your continued love and constancy. I have written you by every monthly steamer since my arrival in this country.
</p><p>
I fear that you are allowing your anxiety for my safety and happiness to prey upon your spirits more than they should. But if I am right in my surmises, it will not be the first case that I have known persons at home to make themselves far more miserable and suffer much more in their solicitude for an absent friend, than he did himself. To be sure, I have had some dark hours here and have not had enough money in my pocket at one meal to buy food for the next, yet I never suffered on that account.
</p><p>
A short time since, I was very ill for about a week but soon recovered and am now in excellent health and spirits. Atkins has been ill, but is getting better and I hope will soon be well. He thinks we are in a deplorable situation, but I think not. Our difficulties are not serious. All will come right in the end.
</p><p>
We were at Mariposa about seven weeks and during a part of that time I worked hard in mud and water two feet deep. I sent you a specimen of 'dust' of our digging and washing, about one-third of all I dug on one day. I sent a part to Mother and another to Prizer. We left that place with the intention of going to the Tuolumne Diggings, coming near Stockton on the way. I wished you could have seen us on our trip from Mariposa to this place. I know you would have hurt your sides with laughter. The distance is about 130 miles, and the greater part of the distance I was leading a cow and calf, travelling over barren plains.
</p><p>
Camp life agrees with me first-rate. I can cook some splendid dishes but it is a part I don't relish much. I know you would laugh at some of our stews, and say our plates were dirty, but so the world wags. I have just built up a fire, and cooked and eaten a hearty supper. To be sure it was not as handsomely done as I have eaten in West Chester, but then the appetite is different. I can eat now with a relish food that would have sickened me then.
</p><p>
Remember me to your sister, your parents if proper, and to Cad. Write me often to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and believe me
</p><p>
Your sincere
</p><p>
