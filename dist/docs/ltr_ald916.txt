EDS. OF Free Trader --Don't you want to come to California? Don't you want to get rich? Do not the piles which we are taking out excite your acquisitiveness? Well, why don't you come? You read the papers and of course see the accounts of the new diggings daily discovered. And you occasionally see men returning with piles, and why can't you get it if they can? Let me see.
</p><p>
The gold is here for a certainty; for a certainty new mines are found, and as certainly the papers report it; men go home, too, with money.
</p><p>
O, aye, it takes a confounded sight of labor and prison fare to look for the placers, and when you get your finger on it, the placer is displaced like the flea's whereabouts and--what amount actually do men bring home? You hear amounts variously estimated; but do you know--do they show you their piles? I have been sometimes amused with reports from your scandal-loving country of the sums which various men have the reputation of bringing home, when it leaks out here not unfrequently that for thousands you should read hundreds. Good Lord--why, I could show you on paper that I am worth from twenty to forty thousand dollars; but if I should show you the gold it might sink to tens. Paper currency is unknown in any other way only as State, county and city script, and that at about sixty per cent. discount--but calculating a man's wealth here on paper generally proves at greater discount than city script.
</p><p>
We hope, however, that this fact will not be made known, and that the gold fever will continue; for we have lots of Indians to kill off and about six hundred miles of mountains to settle, and confidently expect an increase of at least twenty thousand souls to our population, besides the usual mode of peopling new territories.
</p><p>
If you come, don't bring any money; for what is the use when you can shovel it up? It will plague you to keep it when you do--that I
know to be a fact from experience. If you are determined to come, let me give you a few words of advice, so that you can pass muster and be respectable among us.
</p><p>
First, drink brandy; then learn to play at monte; become a member of some church; rob somebody to get your hand in; fill your pockets with bogus dollars; then slope between two days, and you will be prepared to go into business immediately on your arrival without preliminary practice; and you no doubt will be appointed a judge or elected to some office. If you are not, stick to gambling till your turn comes. If you want some inferior business, you can get a silent partner--sometimes called a sleeping partner, though not always silent--and open a cigar store; and then with what you can steal, you will do something in the diggings. I have only to add that you will be in a great country, among a great people, and be one of us.
</p><p>
For the last four months I have been a citizen of San Francisco. As I am a candidate for no office under the sun of California, I can safely say that my interests are not exclusively identified with those of the dear people, but no doubt would be with a fat office in perspective. As it is, I can't well do any other way than tell you the truth.
</p><p>
Well, then, San Francisco is a town such as I never saw before. There is a vast amount of intellect, science, and go-ahead-activeness in its mixed population, and I think it must become one of the most important cities on the Pacific so long as the mines continue productive, and they cannot be exhausted in a lifetime.
</p><p>
The climate is salubrious, and the country along the Coast is healthy; but dead animals in these latter days do emit an offensive effluvia, in spite of what it might have been in Mr. Bryant's times. In sober prose I like San Francisco and the seacoast, and if my three especial reasons were fairly domiciled here, I should prefer living here to any town east of the Rocky Mountains.
</p><p>
As for giving you a labored description of the town, I shan't do it; for you have read descriptions over and over in the papers, and then a bosom friend of mine--ycleped "Old Block," has "done the deed," and I hate to write what has been written over and over
</p><p>
If you will get up a subscription and send me my three reasons, I won't come back at all, but will take a trip to the Celestials and give you sketches from China--as for that matter I could do it almost any day by looking from my office into the street; for we have
</p><p>
Chinese men and women as well as natives from all nations and some parts of the moon. The latter resemble the people of earth very much; only they have tails, wings, and are born with their clothes on, and generally fulfill their promises. For a particular description of these last, please see my journal when I go there, page 56.
</p><p>
Our citizens have been lately gratified with the sight of about a dozen Japanese who were picked up at sea in a shipwrecked condition, far from their native land, by an American ship and brought to this port. You know that Japan has been a sealed country to the world and but little is known of its customs. They resemble somewhat in appearance the Chinese; but there is a marked difference, and it is hoped their advent among us may lead to an intercourse with their nation. I was walking along Long Wharf, one of the principal thoroughfares of our city, on Sunday, in company with a number of ladies and gentlemen, when we met them promenading. We mutually stopped to gaze at each other; the ladies especially attracted their attention, and they apparently seemed unable to determine to what class of humanity the countrywomen belonged, and, like my Indians last summer, appeared to ask each other, "What things those animals were?"--They appear to be an inquisitive but inoffensive race. They are treated with kindness and attention.
</p><p>
Had you received the first part of my journal you would have learned of my first introduction to a somewhat remarkable man, Colonel Joseph S. Watkins, formerly of Virginia. In our trying transit across the plains, we became well acquainted with and formed a warm friendship for each other, and among the thousand petty annoyances of the journey calculated to engender ill-feeling, we had a mutual sympathy which an ignorant, agitatious, and self-willed class of our companions could not understand nor appreciate. I could give you many anecdotes of his goodness of heart and greatness of soul, and you would come to the conclusion that he is of the "salt of the earth," with but few like him. We parted on our arrival in the Valley, though with the expectation of soon meeting again; but this was prevented by a strangecourse of events, an interesting history in itself, and until within a few days we lost sight of each other. About three weeks ago I put a notice in the Pacific News inquiring of him This happily reached him in the southern mines, and he immediately addressed a letter to me, and two days ago I was gratified with a visit from him. A man who was an intimate friend of Jefferson and Marshall, who for a term of twenty-one years occupied a prominent station in the councils of Virginia, a man of large scientific and literary acquirements and of great experience in life, could not fail to be a useful and amusing companion, and
although he has not been successful as a millionaire, he is extensively known in California, respected for his talents, and beloved for his virtues.

The attention of Californians is beginning to be turned to quartz mining extensively, and so far as present prospects are concerned, it promises more certain return than any other mode of working gold. I do not choose to speak of it more particularly now, as much is experimental; but thus far it has been generally successful. I have given my views upon the subject for publication to a gentleman from New York, both geologically and practically, and will not trouble you by a repetition.
</p><p>
Rich veins have been discovered, and I have traced one personally 150 miles. The only way these can be successfully worked is by the concentration of capital; individual labor can do but little.
</p><p>
My opinion is that here is the fountainhead of all the gold and that this species of mining will form for a hundred years to come the legitimate mining, and one of the principal sources of wealth, of California. Extraordinary developments have been made, and I may speak more particularly hereafter. I will, however, mention that it will cost from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars to open a mine and get it ready for practical mining, and science is necessary to be successful.
</p><p>
I forget what your laws and customs are at home. I know only the customs of the Pacific. Will you please inform me whether my wife is married again or not? If a man dines out here, he may find himself turned out of house and home when he comes back to tea, and is met in the door by the other husband to tell him his bread and butter "isn't as it used to was."
</p><p>
A lady came here from the States to join her husband, who was at work in the mines. On her arrival, he dispatched a friend with funds to pay expenses and bring her up to his mountain home. Not hearing from them, "he went down into Egypt" and found his friend married to his wife, and keeping house together. Like a sensible man, however, he went back to the mines and "tended tu what he was duin."
</p><p>
I could give you a list of the latest robberies and murders, but you will get enough by the papers which I send you by the steamers regularly.
</p><p>
I saw Keefer and Olmstead a short time since--well and doing well. I see by a paper that Jesse Green has returned safe, for which I heartily rejoice; for a better man never crossed the plains, nor one whose success would give me more pleasure. I hope to take him by
the hand next fall. I have not seen George Green. I heard he was hard at work, but with what success I did not learn. Direct all communications to me here.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p><p>
