<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='15'>15th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. What a day the Kentuckians have had ! Mrs. Webb gave them a breakfast; from there they proceeded en masse to General Lawton's dinner, and then came straight hero, all of which seems equal to one of Stonewall's 
forced marches. General Lawton took me in to supper. In spite of his dinner he had misgivings. " My heart is 
heavy/ said he, " even here. All seems too light, too careless, for such terrible times. It seems out of place here in 
battle-scarred Richmond." " I have heard something of that kind at home," I replied. " Hope and fear are both 
gone, and it is distraction or death with us. I do not see how sadness and despondency would help us. If it would 
do any good, we would be sad enough.

We laughed at <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>General Hood</a>. General Lawton thought him better fitted for gallantry on the battle-field than playing a lute in my lady's chamber. When Miss Giles was electrifying the audience as the Fair Penitent, some one said : 
" Oh, that is so pretty! " <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> cried out with stern reproachf ulness : "That is not pretty ; it is elegant".

Not only had my house been rifled for theatrical proper ties, but as the play went on they came for my black velvet 
cloak. When it was over, I thought I should never get away, my cloak was so hard to find. But it gave me an 
opportunity to witness many things behind the scenes that cloak hunt did. Behind the scenes! I know a little what that means now.

<a href='/results.php?tla=jes' rel=''>General Jeb Stuart</a> was at Mrs. Randolph's in his cavalry jacket and high boots. He was devoted to Hetty Gary. 
Constance Gary said to me, pointing to his stars, " Hetty likes them that way, you know gilt-edged and with stars.
