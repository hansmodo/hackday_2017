Dear Gail,<br>
When I read your note, after you left here on Christmas Day, I was pleased because
I think a good talk is a fine idea. However, there are some things I want you to think about
before you do that. I'll outline them in this letter. After you've read it, give me a call.<br><br>
First, you should understand that I do not want to control you or your money. What i want is for you 
to set up your investments in such a way as to insure that the income will support you for the rest of
your life, with the principal amount kept intact for Hans and Heidi to share after you are gone. If that
is done, I'm not terribly concerned about how you spend the income, or who you spend it on.<br><br>
Setting up a safe investment program should not be at all difficult. While I don't know the details
of your finances, my impression is that you have about as much money as I do, and Sue and I have no problem
living within our income, even with the occasional special treats like trips to Europe. I wanted to get together
with your lawyer because he is much more in the picture than I am, and because everything I have heard about him
leads me to conclude that he is an able advisor who has your best interests at heart.<br><br>
No doubt my sudden display of interest in your affairs came as a surprise to you so I had better explain
it. There were two main elements: I had been feeling guilty because I know that your father, my brother,
would have expected me to do the things that he would do if he were still alive. Then, when we went out to dinner
recently, some of the things you said about the way you handle your money were a bit frightening to one who has lived
a long time and seen a lot of things go wrong through trusting in blind faith.<br><br>
We all like to think that we don't need lawyers or accountants, but the fact is that we do need them from time to time,
to save us from the consequences of our own mistakes. The proof of that statement is your own comment that same night,
when you said you could not fill out your own income tax return properly without professional help.<br><br>
in a nutshell, these are the things I want you to think about before we meet. I want you to get your affairs in order 
so that you can be sure of an adequate income. What you do with that income is not really my concern, I just want to be
sure you are properly provided for. I'll work hard to assure that you are, even if it makes me unpopular!<br><br>
So consider these things, Gail, then call me when you are ready.<br><br>
Our best to you--<br><br>
