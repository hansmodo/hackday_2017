Dear Brother,
</p><p>
Mr Smith deliverd me your Letter of the 16th; but as one is generally in a hurry & bustle in such places, & at such times as these I have only time to acknowledge it, & add that it would have given me pleaaure to have met you here --I shall refer you to Mr Smith for an Acct of our proceedings up to this day, & you cannot fail of learning the rest from the Squire, who delights in the Minutiæ of a Tale.  I am in doubt whether we shall finish here this week; but as I shall delay little time on the Road in returning, I shall hope to see you on your way up, or down, from Berkeley. I am much obliged to you for the Holly Berries & Cotton Seed. My Love to my Sister & the Children--I had like to have forgot, to express my entire approbation of the laudable pursuit you are [en]gaged in of Tra[in]ing an Independant Company--I have promisd to review the Independant Company of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> sometime this Summer, they having made me a tender of the Command of it, [at] the same time I could review yours and shall very che[er]fully accept the honr of Commanding it if oc[ca]sion requires it to be drawn out, as it is my full intention to devote my Life & Fortune in the cause we are engagd in, if need be.  I remain Dr Sir Yr Most Affecte Brother
