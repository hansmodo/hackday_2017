S m) I have been honored with your Excellency's favor of 
the 22d instant, bearing testimony to the merits and talents of 
Mr. McHenry. The character which I had preconceived of this 
gentleman was precisely that which your representation has 
confirmed. As Congress have not yet fixed the peace establishment for their foreign aifairs, and will not probably fill up 
vacancies, unless there be some critical urgency, until such an 
establishment be made, it is uncertain when an opportunity will 
present itself of taking into consideration the wishes and merits 
of Mr. McHenry. Should my stay here be protracted till that 
happens, which I do not at present expect, I shall feel an additional pleasure in promoting the public interest from my knowledge that I at the same time fulfil both your Excellency's 
public judgment and private inclination.
