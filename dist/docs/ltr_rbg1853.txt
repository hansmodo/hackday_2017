Thanks, what grateful thanks My dear Sister, do I owe you, for your most kind letters, over which I have wept again, 
and again- and prayed for my beloved Brother- whose grief I share, but cannot measure even by that which fills my 
heart- all human sympathy are but drops of comfort, in his great sorrow, but God in his mercy will open a fountain of 
consolation to his mourning spirit- the beloved son, whom "He gave; and hath taken away" will rise in an angels form, 
to whisper peace- memorials of all his virtues & loveliness- his pure and innocent life, and brave qualities, the noble 
heart as tender, and full of filial love- all perfected and immortal- will in future be to him- his very son- his beloved Gary. 
</p><p>
You Dear Ann, and the treasures that are surrounding him, will win him from the indulgence of feelings which have 
so overwhelm'd him- and I trust restore his peace- experience has taught me, that it is thus God deals with us, we live on, 
cherishing those that are taken from us, as tho they were only removed from sight- with the hope of reunion in another world 
</p><p>
I hope My Sister, you can excuse my impatient pleadings- I had sent my letters before yours arrived- forgetting that 
though further away, we got information nearly as soon as you did. 
</p><p>
Your second letter, which I have also received, gives me great comfort, as it tells me Ben is more composed- I trust 
the efforts of his friends will be successful in obtaining the dear remains- Frank Blair is now on the spot to aid them- I 
pray most fervently that Kentucky will not be involved in this dreadful strife- we live here in constant agitation- every 
days account of wrongs & outrages perpetrated by kindred on each other- of familiar friends becoming bitter foes, is too 
appalling to be realized, in our late happy country - even members of the same family warring with each other. Lizzie Lee & her son are at Bethlehem- all the females of the family 
excepting your Aunt Blair, are driven from their home- she will not leave her husband- tho' both are surrounded by 
troops and are uncertain of an hours safety-  
</p><p>
Give dear love for me to My Brother, and all the children. I am glad Bernard is with you- his presence must be a comfort to his father- remember me most kindly to Judge 
Brown- and believe me always My dear Ann your grateful and affectionate 
</p><p>
