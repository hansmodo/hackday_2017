My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favors of the 8th and 20th instant. The first relieved me from much anxiety, as I had seen Mr. Rivington's account 
of the action at Green Spring, which you may suppose was highly colored in their favor. You ask my opinion of the Virginia campaign. Be assured, my dear 
Marquis, your conduct meets my warmest approbation, as it must that of every body. Should it ever be said, 
that my attachment to you betrayed me into partiality, you have only to appeal to facts to refute any such charge. But I trust there will be no occasion.
</p><p>
Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='co-worker met'>Colonel Hamilton</a> will join the advanced corps under the orders of Colonel Scammell 
</p><p>
I very much approve of your intention of reinforcing <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, as soon as circumstances will allow, and as strongly as possible. 11' he can only maintain 
the advantages he has already gained in the Carolinas and Georgia, the British ministry will make a very diligent figure in the political scene from that, which it is plain they expected, by Lord George Germain's letters of March last. 
</p><p>
Private Letter, July 30th. â€” T take your private 
letter of the 20th in the light which you wish it, that 
of an unreserved communication from one friend to 
another ; and I should be wanting in candor, were I 
not to expose my sentiments to you in as free a manner. I am convinced, that your desire to be with 
this army arises principally from a wish to be actively 
useful. You will not, therefore, regret your stay in 
Virginia until matters are reduced to a greater degree 
of certainty, than they are at present, especially when 
I tell you, that, from the change of circumstances 
with which the removal of part of the enemy's force 
from Virginia to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> will be attended, it is more than probable, that we shall also entirely change our plan of operations. I think we have already effected one part of the plan of the campaign settled at 
Weathersfield ; that is, giving a substantial relief to the 
southern States, by obliging the enemy to recall a considerable part of their force from thence. Our views 
must now be turned towards endeavouring to expel 
them totally from those States, if we find ourselves 
incompetent to the siege of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The difficulty 
of doing this does not so much depend upon obtaining a force capable of effecting it, as upon the mode 
of collecting that force to the proper point, and transporting the provisions and stores necessary for such 
an operation. You are fully acquainted with the almost impracticability of doing this by land ; to say nothing of the amazing loss of men always occasioned 
by long marches, and those towards a quarter in which 
the service is disagreeable. I should not, however, 
hesitate to encounter these difficulties, great as they 
are, had we not prospects of transporting ourselves in 
a manner safe, easy, and expeditious. Your penetration will point out my meaning, which I cannot venture to express in direct terms. 
</p><p>
I approve of your resolution to reinforce <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, in proportion to the detachment which the 
enemy may make to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Let your next attention be paid to training and forming the militia, with 
which you may be furnished, and disposing of them in 
such a manner, that they may be drawn at the shortest notice to whatever point the enemy may make 
their capital post, which I conclude will be at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. The establishment of magazines at safe deposits will be in all cases necessary ; but, above all things, 
I recommend an aiigmciitatit)ii of your cavalry to 
as great an extent as possible. It may happen, that 
the enemy may be driven to the necessity of forcing 
their way through North Carolina to avoid a greater 
misfortune. A superiority of horse on our side would 
be fatal to them in such a case. 
</p><p>
The advantages resulting from a move of the French fleet from Newport to the Chesapeake were carefully and strongly pointed out to Count de Barras, and I thought he had once agreed to put it in execution ; but, by 
his late letters, he seemed to think that such a manoeuvre might interfere with greater plans, and therefore he declined it. It would now be too late to answer the principal object, as, by accounts from a deserter, the troops arrived from Virginia last Friday. 
</p><p>
Should your return to this army be formally determined upon, I cannot flatter you with a command equal to your expectations or my wishes. You know 
the over proportion of general officers to our numbers, and can therefore conceive where the difficulty will be. <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='co-worker'>General McDougall</a> is not yet provided for, and the 
Jersey anti York troops are reserved for him. They are promised to him, though they have not yet joined. 
</p><p>
In my letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, which I beg the 
favor of you to forward, I have hinted nothing of 
what I have said to you, for fear of miscarriage. You 
will probably find a safe opportunity from your army 
to him, and you will oblige me by communicating the 
part of this letter, which relates to my expectation of 
being able to transport part of the army to the southward, should the operation against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> be declined. 
</p><p>
I wish, as I mentioned in my last, to send a confidential person to you to explain at large what I 
have so distantly hinted ; but I am really at a loss, on 
account of not knowing the officers better, to find one 
upon whose discretion I can depend. My own family, 
you know, are constantly and fully employed. I hope, 
however, that I have spoken plain enough to be understood by you. With every sentiment of affection 
and regard, I am, &,c.
