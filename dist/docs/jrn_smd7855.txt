I had thought my running days were over; so little did I anticipate another stampede that I did 
not notice the report of the attack that was prophesied for night before last, and went to bed without 
gathering my clothes. But to-day comes a hasty note from Charlie, telling us to leave instantly as General Breckinridge is advancing with ten thousand men to attack us, and at 12 M. yesterday was within thirty-four miles. He begged us to leave today; there would be trouble before to-morrow night. 
It was so earnest, and he asserted all so positively, that we are going to Phillie's this evening to stay a week, as they say eight days will decide. Ah, me! 
our beautiful town! Still I am skeptical. If it must be, pray Heaven that the blow comes now I Nothing 
can be equal to suspense. These poor men ! Are they not dying fast enough ? Will Baumstark have orders for an unlimited supply of coffins next week? Only 
Charlie's family, ours, and the Brunots know it. He enjoined the strictest secrecy, though the Brunots 
sent to swear Mrs. Loucks in, as she, like ourselves, has no protector. I would like to tell everybody; 
but it will warn the Federals. I almost wish we, too, had been left in ignorance; it is cruel to keep it to ourselves. I believe the Yankees expect something ; 
"they say " they have armed fifteen hundred negroes. Foes and insurrection in town, assailing friends out side. Nice time!

Our cavalry has passed the Amite. Poor Charlie has come all the way to the ferry landing on the other side to warn us. If we do not take advantage, it 
will not be for want of knowing what is to come. How considerate it was in him to come such a long way! I am charmingly excited! If I only had a pair 
of breeches, my happiness would be complete. Let it come! I lose all, but in Heaven's name let us have it over at once! My heart fails when I look around, 
but "Spit fire!" and have an end to this at once! Liberty forever, though death be the penalty.

Treason ! Here lies my pass at my elbow, in which has been gratuitously inserted that "Parties holding 
it are considered to give their parole not to give information, countenance, aid, or support to the so-called Confed. S." As I did not apply for it, agree 
to the stipulation, or think it by any means proper, I don't consider it binding. I could not give my word 
for doing what my conscience tells me is Right. I cross with this book full of treason. It "countenances" the C. S.; shall I burn it? That is a stupid 
ruse ; they are too wise to ask you to subscribe to it, they just append it.
