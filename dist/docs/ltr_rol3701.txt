Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In compliance with the directions of Congress, contained in the inclosed resolution, I have the honor 
to inform your Excellency that our last despatches, 
dated in October, announced a disposition in the belligerent powers to terminate the war by a general 
peace. The Court of London, whose sincerity was 
most suspected because it was to make the greatest 
sacrifices, appears to have smoothed the way, by the 
commission to Mr. Oswald, which your Excellency 
has seen, empowering him to treat with the Thirteen 
United States of America. Mr. Hayneval, brother to 
Mr, Gerard, having been sent from France to sound 
the intentions of the British Ministry, returned perfectly satisfied of their sincerity, 
</p><p>
A little before our despatches were closed, our Ministers had delivered three ji'opositions to the Court 
of London. They consisted of three general heads, 
which comprised our right to the fisheries, the extent 
of our territories, and commercial objects. Though these propositions contained all we could ask, under 
each of these heads, yet Mr. Oswald gave our Ministers reason to conclude that they would be granted; 
which I am inclined to believe they have been, in 
their fullest extent, from the lead which our Ministers 
have taken in signing Provisional Articles. 
</p><p>
France, Spain, and Holland had made their proposals, so that the King of Great Britain was perfectly 
apprised of their demands before he met his Parliament. There is little room, therefore, to doubt, when 
these facts are compared with the speech of His Britannic Majesty, that, unless some unforeseen event 
should arise, a general peace will be concluded before the opening of the next campaign. 
</p><p>
I was honored by your letter of the 18th, and 
have delivered the one inclosed to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, who 
is detained, by order of Congress, till they receive 
more certain advices as to the issue of the negotiation. I should also acknowledge the receipt of your 
favor of the 8th of January, which I found here on 
my return from the country. I think with you, that 
the British Administration will choose to take the advice of Parliament on the terms of peace, before they 
agree to them. Yet they have gone every length 
with respect to us. In this, however, they are perfectly safe ; as the opposition have, all along, dictated 
that measure, so that, on This quarter, they are secure from their attacks. More circumspection will be 
necessary in adjusting the Articles with the other 
belligerent powers. To this cause we may probably 
attribute the delays that the business still seems to 
struggle with. 
</p><p>
Be pleased. Sir, to accept my compliments, and 
those of my family, who join me in returning our 
best respects to Mrs. Washington. I have the honor 
to be, dear Sir, with great respect and esteem, 
Your most obedient, humble servant,
