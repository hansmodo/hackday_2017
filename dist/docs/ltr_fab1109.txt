<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento</a> CITY, October 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>
</p><p>
I have just finished writing to Father and Mother and refer to their letter for a brief description of the city and what we are doing in the way of business, with Capt. Cole and myself here and John Benson in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> to buy goods, the Brig George Emery for a store house and our lot and store filled with goods, with just as much as we can attend to to wait on customers. I think we are in a fair way to make our pile and be ready to come home one of these years.

I had a happy time at sea and two months passed away without any change but two months here are equal to one year at home. We have arrived, sold most of our cargo, put it ashore ourselves, put up our store and the place has grown one half in size. You have no idea how
this country is going ahead. Last spring there was nobody here and now the people are as thick as in the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>. Stages run regularly to the mines; steamboats run on the river; a theatre, church and several large handsome hotels with billiard saloons and bowling alleys and all the fixings, have been put up. Even a couple of girls are around with a hand organ and tambourine. Civilization is making rapid strides. You may consider me squatted, settled, regularly enrolled as a citizen of this city. I like the climate situation and the people here first rate and I believe it is bound to blaze. This and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> will be the places in California.

The city is laid out one mile square. The streets 80 feet wide, crossing each other at right angles. They have spared most of the noble white oaks that line the banks of the river so the streets are all set out with trees full grown. The streets are lettered up from the river: A, B, C, etc. and numbered parallel with it: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. We are on H Street, between 5th and 6th. Right below our store is one of the most busy scenes you ever saw. It is a large livery stable where they sell horses, mules, oxen and carts at auction. The auctioneer gets on the animal and rides him up and down the street, shows him off to the best advantage and frequently four or five are selling at once. Such a Babel of sounds! There is always a large crowd and some rare sport. You know I always liked riding on horseback and if I only had time I could have enough of it here. We bought a fine riding horse for $109 at auction, bought from the Snake Indians with saddle, bridle, spurs alone six inches long, all complete. Everyone rides on horseback as carriages are scarce.

Out of the town the country is one level prairie, a grand chance to ride. Don't I course it over the plain occasionally! Out about two miles stands Sutters Fort, quite a large establishment. Old Sutter himself lives on a ranch
up country. The old fellow must be immensely rich. At any rate he keeps drunk all the time.

I write this from the cabin of the George Emery. She will probably lay her bones here. I have slept on a board since the 23rd of January. We board at an eating house next door, above us and let one half the upper part of our store to the man and his wife and child for the low rent of $72 per month (what would a down East house come to?) We can rent our store 14 ft. by 28 ft. for $500 per month anytime. We pay $18 per week for board. The man who keeps the house (Lindley) is a young fellow, all the way from Conn. and with his wife and little girl came across the plains. His wife is much the better half, I guess; quite a lady and will be quite an addition to our establishment. A great many women came across the country with their husbands and it is no uncommon sight to see one in the streets. I believe Mrs. Lindley is the first American woman I have spoken with since I left Rio. I am getting to be perfectly savage and at the same time quite domestic, for until within a week we cooked on board and I washed up the dishes. Have washed my own clothes ever since I left N.Y. I don't use much starch. White shirts I have discarded. They get dirty too quickly and don't wash half as easily as red flannel or calico. Shaving is all humbug. Nobody shaves here and you can't find a better looking set of men. I am going to have my daguerreotype taken and sent home to show you how I have improved. Full dress here is a pair of buckskin pants, fringed, with a red silk sash, fancy shirt and frock of buckskin trimmed with bell buttons and broad brimmed felt hat and revolver slung on one side and a Bowie knife on the other, with a pair of skins about a foot long. The horses are fine looking animals. The saddle I can't describe and here you have a picture of most of the miners. Although most everyone goes around with a revolver I have never seen one used but
once. In the crowd at the horse auction one man struck another over the head with the butt of a rifle. What for I never learnt. The man drew himself out of the crowd, took out his six shooter and commenced blazing away, right into the crowd of fifty men. One man was shot in the breast but not mortally. He fired three shots and stopped. Then, says he: 'I'll let you know I am a man of honor! By G--!' Nobody took any notice of it. There is no police here and the man went off.
</p><p>
Tomorrow I start for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> on the steamer Sacramento and take down six thousand dollars in dust to send to R. B. B. It is something of a risk but I think there will be no trouble. I will finish this at S.F.
