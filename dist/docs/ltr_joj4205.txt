Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received, and thank you for, the interesting report 
of the joint committee of both houses of your Legislature, 
relative to certain proceedings of the Bank of the United 
States, which you were so obliging as to send me. 
</p><p>
Controversies between the national and a state government, or any of their respective departments, are to be 
regretted. It is desirable that the one which occasioned 
this report, should be brought to an amicable and satisfactory termination ; and that the limits which bound the authorities of the national and state governments be well ascertained and observed. 
</p><p>
However extensive the constitutional power of a government to impose taxes may be, I think it should not be so 
exercised as to impede or discourage the lawful and useful 
industry and exertions of individuals. Hence, the prudence 
of taxing the products of beneficial labour, either mental or 
manual, appears to be at least questionable. 
</p><p>
Whether taxation should extend only to property, or 
only to income, or to both, are points on which opinions 
have not been uniform. I am inclined to think, that both 
should not be taxed. If the first is preferred, then tax the 
land and stock of a farmer, but not his crops ; tax his milchcows, but not their milk, nor the butter and cheese made of 
it, whether the same be sent to market or consumed in his 
family. Tax the real and personal estate of a physician 
and a lawyer, but not the conjectural and varying profits 
they derive from the skilful and industrious exercise of 
their professions, &c. &c. 
</p><p>
On this and similar subjects, there will be different opinions. Our minds are probably as little alike as our features ; and it is not uncommon for men of unquestionable 
talents and candour to take opposite sides of the same question : neither of them being culpable, both are entitled to 
allowances for the risk of committing mistakes, to which 
we are all more or less exposed. 
</p><p>
It is an agreeable circumstance that prosperity attends 
you ; and permit me to add, that for its continuance and 
increase, you have the best wishes of 
</p><p>
Sir, your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
