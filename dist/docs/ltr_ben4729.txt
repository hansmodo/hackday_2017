IT gave me great pleasure to see my dear good friend's 
name at the foot of a letter I received the other day, having 
been often uneasy at his long silence, blaming myself as the 
cause by my own previous backwardness and want of punctuality as a correspondent. I now suppose, (as in this he mentions nothing of it,) that a long letter I wrote him about this 
time twelvemonth, on the subject of the disputes with 
America, did miscarry, or that his answer to that letter miscarried, as I have never heard from him since I wrote that 
letter. 
</p><p>
I have long been of an opinion similar to that you express, 
and think happiness consists more in small conveniences or 
pleasures that occur every day, than in great pieces of good 
fortune that happen but seldom to a man in the course of his 
life. Thus I reckon it among my felicities, that I can set my 
own razor, and shave myself perfectly well ; in which I have 
a daily pleasure, and avoid the uneasiness one is sometimes 
obliged to suffer from the dirty fingers or bad breath of a 
slovenly barber.

I congratulate you on the purchase of a new house so much 
to your mind, and wish that you may long inhabit it with comfort. The inconvenience you mention of neighbouring smoke 
coming down the vents, is not owing to any bad construction 
of the vent down which it comes, and therefore not to be 
remedied by any change of form. It is merely the effect of 
a law of nature, whereby, whenever the outward air is warmer 
than the walls of the vent, the air included, being by those 
walls made colder, and of course denser and heavier than an 
equal column of the outward air, descends into the room, and 
in descending draws other air into the vent above to supply 
its place ; which, being in its turn cooled and condensed by 
the cooler walls of the vent, descends also, and so a current 
downwards is continued during the continuance of such difference in temperament between the outward air and the walls 
of the vent. 
</p><p>
When this difference is destroyed, by the outward air growing cooler, and the walls growing warmer, the current downwards ceases ; and, when the outward air becomes still colder 
than the walls, the current changes and moves from below 
upwards, the warmer walls rarefying the air they include, and 
thereby making it so much lighter than a column of the outward air of equal height, that it is obliged to give way to the 
other's superior weight and rise, is succeeded by colder air, 
which being warmed and rarefied in its turn, rises also, and 
so the upward current is continued. In summer, when fires 
are not made in the chimneys, the current generally sets 
downward from nine or ten in the morning during all the heat 
of the day, till five or six in the afternoon, then begins to hesitate, and afterwards to set upwards during the night, continuing till about nine in the morning, then hesitating for 
some time before it again sets downwards for the day. This 
is the general course, with some occasional variation of hours, 
according to the length of days or changes of weather. 
</p><p>
Now when the air of any vent is in this descending state, if 
the smoke issuing from a neighbouring vent happens to be 
carried over it by the wind, part will be drawn in and brought 
down into the room. The proper remedy then is, to close the 
opening of the chimney in the room by a board so fitted that 
little or no air can pass, whereby the currents above mentioned 
will be prevented. This board to remain during the summer, 
and when fires are not made in the chimney. Chimneys that 
have fires in them daily are not subject to this inconvenience, 
the walls of their vents being kept too warm to occasion any 
downward current during the hours between the going out 
of one fire and the kindling of another. And indeed, in summer, those vents that happen to go up close joined with the 
kitchen vent, are generally kept so warm by that as to be free 
from the downward current, and therefore free from what you 
call neighbour smoke.

The <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> grate which you mention is a very good 
thing, if you could get one that is rightly made, and a workman skilful in putting them up. Those generally made and 
used here are much hurt by fancied improvements in their 
construction, and I cannot recommend them. As fuel with 
you is cheap and plenty, a saving in it is scarce an object. 
The sliding plates (of which I sent a model to Sir Alexander 
Dick) are, in my opinion, the most convenient for your purpose, as they keep a room sufficiently warm, are simple 
machines, easily fixed, and their management easily conceived and understood by servants.

I shall leave Europe with much greater regret, if I cannot 
first visit you and my other friends in Scotland. I promise 
myself this happiness, but am not yet clear that I shall have 
time for it. Your kind invitation is extremely obliging. 
With sincere esteem I am, my dear friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately,

B. FRANKLIN.
