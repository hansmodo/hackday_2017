MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RECEIVED your favor of the 2d by Mr. Dexter, and 
this morning from Mr. Gerry an account of your 
health on the 4th, which have relieved me from some 
anxiety, as I had received no letter from you since 
you were in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I have seen many cities and fine places since you 
left me, and particularly <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. Mrs. 
Washington and her whole family very kindly inquired after your health and all your children, and 
sent many friendly greetings. I like the seat of government very well, and shall sleep or lie awake next 
winter in the President's house. I have slept very 
well on my journey, and been pretty well. An abundance of company and many tokens of respect have 
attended my journey, and my visit here is well received. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Dexter lodge with me 
at Tunnicliff's City Hotel, very near the capitol. The 
establishment of the public offices in this place has 
given it the air of the seat of government, and all 
things seem to go on well. 
</p><p>
I am particularly pleased with <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>. Mr. Lee lives very elegantly, neatly and agreeably there, 
among his sisters and friends, and among his fine 
lots of clover and timothy. I scarcely know a more 
eligible situation. Oh ! that I could have a home ! 
But this felicity has never been permitted me. Roll 
ing, rolling, rolling, till I am very near rolling into 
the bosom of mother earth. 
</p><p>
I am, as ever, your affectionate husband, 
</p><p>
