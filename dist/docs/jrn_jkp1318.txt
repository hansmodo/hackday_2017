By the Southern mail of this evening official despatches were received from <a href="/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor</a> giving a detailed account of the battle of the 22d and 23d ultimo. 
It was a severe battle. Many valuable officers and men fell, and among them my old esteemed friend, <a href="/results.php?tla=ahy" rel="friend met">Col. Archibald Yell</a> of the Arkansas Mounted Regiment. I deeply deplore his loss. He was a brave and good man, and among the best friends I had on earth, and had been so for twenty-five years. His eldest, and perhaps his only son, is now at college at Georgetown, and as my impression is that Col. Yell died poor, I will in that event educate the boy, and shall take great interest in him.

A despatch from Commodore Conner was received tonight, communicating the information that <a href="/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>'s forces had landed near Vera Cruz on the 7th instant without serious resistance.

Had <a href="/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor</a> obeyed his orders, and occupied Monterey and the passes beyond it, the severe loss of our army, including many valuable officers, would have been avoided. It was great rashness to take the position he did in advance of Saltillo. Having done so, he is indebted not to his own good generalship, but to the indomitable and intrepid bravery of the officers and men under his command for his success. He exposed them to an opposing army of three or four times their number. The Mexican army were suffering from want of food, and took up their retreat shortly after the battle. <a href="/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor</a> is a hard fighter, but has  none of the other qualities of a great general. From the beginning of the existing war with Mexico he has been constantly blundering into difficulties, but has fought out of them, but, with very severe loss. His first blunder was in separating his army from his supplies, which caused the battle of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. His second was in moving upon Monterey with an, inadequate force, leaving more than two thirds of his whole army behind him with the batteries and trains, and this caused the hard battle and some loss at Monterey; and the last is in taking his position so far in advance of Monterey, which caused the late sanguinary battle. I rejoice that our brave army have been successful in this battle, but deeply lament the severe loss they have sustained.
