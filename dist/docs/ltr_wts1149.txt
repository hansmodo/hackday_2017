CAMP BEFORE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, April 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.

Dear Brother: 
</p><p>
Mr. Dana is here. He spent a few hours with me 
yesterday, and I went over with him many of the events 
of the past year, with the maps and records with which I 
am well supplied. Indeed, all look to me for maps and 
facts. Dana remarked to one of Grant's staff incidentally, that he was better pleased with me than he 
could possibly have expected. In the two days he has 
been here he has seen an illustration of the truth of 
my proposition, which has drawn on me such volumes 
of abuse. We have had thousands of men working by 
night, putting batteries as close up to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> as possible, secretly, and in opening a channel by which we may 
in high water reach the river twenty-five miles below 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>. (Secrecy was essential, but the papers of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> announce the whole fact. I know the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> 
dailies go before daylight each day to Hernando, 25 
miles, and are telegraphed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> by noon of the 
same day. Indeed, the day before yesterday we met 
some <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> officers, who asked that I should come 
with a flag of truce to discuss a point as to exchange 
of prisoners, and as we parted, one, a Major Watts, 
asked me not to open our batteries (the secret) last 
night, as he was going to have a party and did not 
want to be disturbed.

'Nothing can prevent the fatal practice, but excluding 
all men from our camp but men who must fight. They 
at least have a personal interest in what should be 
revealed and what concealed. . . .

Affectionately,
