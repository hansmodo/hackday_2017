My Dear Robert:  I was very glad to see from your letter of the 2d
the progress you are making in your farm.  I hope things may move
prosperously with you, but you must not expect this result without
corresponding attention and labour.  I should like very much to visit
you, but it will be impossible.  I have little time for anything but
my business.  I am here with your <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse met">mother</a>, waiting to see the effects
of these waters upon her disease, before proceeding to the Warm Springs.
She is pleased with the bath, which she finds very agreeable, and it
has reduced the swelling in her feet and ankles, from which she has
been suffering for a long time, and, in fact, from her account, entirely
removed it.  This is a great relief in itself, and, I hope, may be
followed by greater.  I do not think she moves with more facility,
though I think she walks [on her crutches] oftener and longer than
heretofore, and probably with more confidence.  She has been her too
short a time to pronounce positively as to the effects of the water,
and will have to remain three or four weeks before we determine whether
she will go further.  I am unwilling for her to lose the whole summer
here unless it promises some advantage, and, after the middle of next
week, unless some marked change takes place, shall take her to the
Warm Springs.  Custis has gone to the White Sulphur, but expects to
be in Richmond on August 6th to meet <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfl" rel="child met">Fitzhugh</a>, with the view of going
to the Warrenton White Sulphur Springs in North Carolina, to witness
the erection of a monument over dear Annie, which the kind people of
that country have prepared for the purpose.  My attendance on your
mother, which is necessary, prevents my being present.  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=agl" rel="child met">Agnes</a> and
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mil" rel="child met">Mildred</a> are here.  I think the baths have been beneficial to them
already, though they have not been here a week.  I will leave them
to describe the place and visitors.  I applied the dressing of salt
to the old meadow at Arlington with the view of renovating the grass.
I believe it is equally good for corn.  It was refuse salt--Liverpool--
which I bought cheaply in Alexandria from the sacks having decayed
and broken, but I cannot recollect exactly how much I applied to the
acre.  I think it was about two or three bushels to the acre.  You had
better consult some work on farming as to the quantity.  I would advise
you to apply manure of some kind to all your land.  I believe there
is nothing better or cheaper for you to begin with than shell lime.
I would prefer cultivating less land manured in some way than a large
amount unassisted.  We are always delighted to hear from you, and I
trust with care you may escape the chills.  The incentives I spoke of
were a sweet wife and child.  God bless you, my dear son.
</p><p>
                    Most affectionately,
</p><p>
