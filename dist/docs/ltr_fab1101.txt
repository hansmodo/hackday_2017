When I took your letter out of the Post Office this morning I said to myself, 'Now here comes a blast from Mary!' for from what Father wrote, I thought I had thrown you all into fits, but I am rejoiced to see from your letter that you think in some measure as I do. When I heard the accounts from the gold region I thought, at first, it was all humbug, gotten up to induce people to emigrate. But now I am fully convinced and the most
slow to believe are also. I have seen letters from the son of Secretary Macey to a friend in the city. A. G. has received letters from his agent. Uncle Richard has had letters from Captains he sent out and also from two young men who took out goods last Spring. These young men have made $40,000 and one of them is coming home with it. A. G.'s agent, Bob Parker, (you know him) writes that he has sold out his goods at an enormous profit. He kept one man constantly weighing gold dust and he has $100,000 on hand and was going down to Mazatlan to exchange it for coin. Young Macey writes that he did not believe it at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and went up to the mines to see for himself. He saw them washing out the gold in tin pans and digging it up with sheath knives. One man got $4,000 in one day, but the most of them about $50 to $100 per day. This is hard to believe but all the letters and accounts go to prove that the half has not been told us. Great quantities have been sent here to the banks and Mint. I have seen some of it myself, in little scales and grains, pure as our gold coin.
</p><p>
But there is another proof, yet. Look out on the docks and you will see from twenty to thirty ships loading with all kinds of merchandise and filling up with passengers, and when I see business firms--rich men--going into it, men who know how to make money too, and young men of my acquaintance leaving good situations and fitting themselves out with arms and ammunition, tents, provisions and mining implements, there is something about it--the excitement, the crossing the Isthmus, seeing new countries and the prospect of making a fortune in a few years--that takes hold of my imagination, that tells me 'Now is your chance. Strike while the iron is hot!'
</p><p>
You know that I am in the prime of life--a good constitution, know how to shovel, can live in a log house
or a tent, and build one too. You know that I always had a desire to travel, to see something of the world. Now, when shall I ever have a better chance? I can hardly make a living here. We have no capital to carry on business with and it will be a long time before we can get a start. Labor is capital out there. I am assured by persons that have lived there that it is a fine country, perfectly healthy and room enough for us all.
</p><p>
I have looked at the subject in all its bearings. I have looked at my chance here and I have made up my mind to go and I am going if I have to go out as a common sailor. It has taken nearly every cent I have made here to pay my expenses as I go along so I have but very little money on hand. Uncle Richard has very kindly given me one hundred dollars and intends to send us a consignment of goods. There are five of us going out together. John Benson goes on Saturday to look after their business. We have paid our passage in the Steam Ship Panama, which sails from Panama on the Pacific, the 15th of February, for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. We go from here to Chagres in a sailing vessel and cross the land to Panama.
</p><p>
Now, my dear sister, much as I regret leaving you and my parents for so long a time, still I think it is the best thing I can do. I thought you would approve of it and believe me I feel greatly obliged to you for your good intentions. I wish I could see and embrace you once more but there is not time for me to come home. Don't look on the dark side--that's my philosophy--but think of those $4,000 lumps that I am going to pick up and remit to you.

Harriett Pond is full of it. Her brother is one of our party and she thinks about going herself.

Captain Cole is in the office now. Says 'Tell Mary I am going with my vessel.'

It is time for me to go to supper and I must stop. The
weather is beautiful and warm. The cholera is still killing them off at Staten Island and there has been one case in the city but, as you suppose, we think nothing of it. The California fever has actually frightened it off.
