<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='13'>13th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. Mr. Chesnut fretting and fuming. From the poor old blind bishop downward everybody is besetting 
him to let off students, theological and other, from going 
into the army. One comfort is that the boys will go. Mr. Chesnut answers : " Wait until you have saved your country before you make preachers and scholars. When you have a country, there will be no lack of divines, students, 
scholars to adorn and purify it. He says he is a one-idea man. That idea is to get every possible man into the ranks.

Professor Le Conte is an able auxiliary. He has undertaken to supervise and carry on the powder-making enterprise the very first attempted in the Confederacy, and Mr. Chesnut is proud of it. It is a brilliant success, thanks to Le Conte.

Mr. Chesnut receives anonymous letters urging him to arrest the Judge as seditious. They say he is a dangerous 
and disaffected person. His abuse of <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Jeff Davis</a> and the Council is rabid. Mr. Chesnut laughs and throws the letters into the fire. " Disaffected to Jeff Davis," says he; " disaffected to the Council, that don't count. He knows 
what he is about; he would not injure his country for the world."

Read Uncle Tom's Cabin again. These negro women have a chance here that women have nowhere else. They 
can redeem themselves the "impropers" can. They can marry decently, and nothing is remembered against these 
colored ladies. It is not a nice topic, but <a href='/results.php?tla=hbs' rel=''>Mrs. Stowe</a> revels in it. How delightfully Pharisaic a feeling it must be to 
rise superior and fancy we are so degraded as to defend and like to live with such degraded creatures around us such men as Legree and his women.

The best way to take negroes to your heart is to get as far away from them as possible. As far as I can see, 
Southern women do all that missionaries could do to prevent and alleviate evils. The social evil has not been sup 
pressed in old England or in New England, in London or in Boston. People in those places expect more virtue from a 
plantation African than they can insure in practise among themselves with all their own high moral surroundings 
light, education, training, and support. Lady Mary Montagu says, " Only men and women at last." " Male and 
female, created he them, says the Bible. There are cruel, graceful, beautiful mothers of angelic Evas North as well 
as South, I dare say. The Northern men and women who came here were always hardest, for they expected an African to work and behave as a white man. We do not.

I have often thought from observation truly that perfect beauty hardens the heart, and as to grace, what so 
graceful as a cat, a tigress, or a panther. Much love, admiration, worship hardens an idol's heart. It becomes utterly callous and selfish. It expects to receive all and to give nothing. It even likes the excitement of seeing people suffer. I speak now of what I have watched with horror and amazement. 
</p><p>
Topsys I have known, but none that were beaten or illused. Evas are mostly in the heaven of <a href='/results.php?tla=hbs' rel=''>Mrs. Stowe's</a> imagination. People can't love things dirty, ugly, and repulsive, simply because they ought to do so, but they can be 
good to them at a distance ; that's easy. You see, I can not rise very high ; I can only judge by what I see.
