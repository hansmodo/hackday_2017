<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='12'>12th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Better to-day. A long, long weary day in grief has passed away. I suppose General Chesnut is some 
where but where? that is the question. Only once has he visited this sad spot, which holds, he says, all that he cares 
for on earth. Unless he comes or writes soon I will cease, or try to cease, this wearisome looking, looking, looking for him.
