On Tuesday morning last, we arose early, partook a hasty breakfast, struck our tent, and with our baggage reached the steamer as she was about to start off. The shores of the river presented nothing but high and rugged hills covered with low bushes or short grass. By four o'clock in the afternoon we reached the city of Benicia, a small village about fifty miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Here the steamer run alongside an old vessel answering the double purpose of storehouse and wharf, and when she went to start off, we found she was fast in the mud, but she was soon gotten off, by a little backing and pulling. We passed rolling ground until we reached New York a little after sunset, where we halted a few minutes to land some passengers. It is also a small village. After passing New York, the river became narrow and crooked and difficult of navigation, and although the steamer is very small, the engine had to be stopped often and poles taken to fend her off the banks.

The Mint has not more than half a dozen berths in her and these are for her own workmen. We were pretty much crowded and a spot large enough for a
man to lie down on could not be found. We spent a horrible night. About ten o'clock I crept into the hold and lay down upon two boxes and a barrel, and slept soundly until two o'clock. At daylight we reached Stockton and stopped about two hours. We went ashore and paid $1.50 each for breakfast. Stockton is larger, better-built and much more pleasantly situated than any of the towns between here and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>.

During the greater part of Wednesday, it rained and was very disagreeable travelling. The land we passed was almost as level as a floor and at many places the river has overflowed the banks and for miles nothing but a swamp was to be seen. We reached San Joaquin about three Wednesday afternoon, landed our goods and pitched our tent on the river bank. We use river water which is excellent, and get our wood close by. When we arrived there were but two one-story houses here, and one of them covered with canvas, and six or eight tents, but there are now about a dozen tents. For 20 miles either way a level prairie is stretched out to view until it reaches the base of a range of high hills, the tops of which are covered with snow.

After breakfast next morning I took my rifle and strolled up the river about a mile, until I fell in with a couple of settlers who were cultivating a small patch of ground, intending to supply this embryo city with vegetables in time to come. Ducks and geese are plentiful along the river but they are very shy and hard to shoot.

Parties of three and four are seen passing up the river every hour or two in small boats to the different mines. But they are all like ourselves, not knowing how near their boats will carry them to the wished-for places, but willing to go and find out for themselves.
<p></p>
A number of Frenchmen who came up in the steamerwith us have left in a small whale boat for Merced City, near the Merced Mines.

We have concluded to store our trunk, take our tent and what clothes we can on our backs, and start on the morrow for Wood's Diggings. Before we came, we were informed that better accommodationswere to be found here for going to the mines than at Stockton, but at the latter place persons offered to carry freight for us to Wood's Diggings for twenty dollars per cwt., and here we cannot get our goods taken up at any price, and we have not enough to load a whole train of mules, and if we had, it would cost thirty-five dollar per cwt. As we can carry no cooking utensils except a tin cup each, we have purchased and cooked three beef tongues at 37 1/2 cents apiece to take with us, and a few pounds of pilot bread at 20 cents per lb.

Although it is now the early part of March, the trees are beginning to spread out their green foliage, and the plains skirting the river are covered with fine green grass from three to five inches long upon which a large number of mules belonging to the camp, and a few scattered herds of cattle, are feeding. We have been greeted by a great number of coyotes, small prairie wolves, barking and howling for an hour or two. They appeared to be quite near camp, but as they are inoffensive and do no harm except to carry off bits of provisions if they have a chance, we were not in the least disturbed. But last night a party of Californians commenced gambling and drinking in a tent close by and kept up their infernal noise and revels until daylight this morning, then fought with knives and separated.

Early this morning notice was posted against the door of the only house in this city that an election would be
held during the day for alcalde, sheriff, and town clerk. About ten o'clock the people assembled at the aforesaid house, chose their election officers, and then commenced voting. There was only one ticket in the field, and the question of Whig and Locofoco was not asked. Everybody was invited to vote whether residents or not. Some of the persons who are interested in the success of the city even went to the river and invited some boatmen who were passing by to come up to the polls and vote. At first they refused, but being insisted upon, they stated they were citizens of the world and not of any particular place, therefore they might as well vote here as anywhere. Although we only arrived here a few days since and intend to leave soon, we were requested to vote. Two of us did so, but Atkins declined. This is the first vote I ever cast and I can truly say, if that amounts to anything, that I attended the first election ever held in San Joaquin City.
