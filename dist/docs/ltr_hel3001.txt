SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing to your Excellency, the 
4th, by Jones ; since which I have presented to Congress your Excellency's favors of the 1st, 3d, and 4th. 
Upon reading the first, I took occasion to intimate 
to Mr. Duer the distressed situation of his friend 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>, as described by the General himself in a late letter of the 15th of March, and this 
morning suggested again to the House the demands 
of all the General Officers, subjects of the suspended 
inquiry. I shall repeat the same to-morrow ; and, 
having just now obtained the concurrence of gentlemen in private conversation, that Congress are 
guardians of the honor of their officers, I flatter 
myself there will be no further delay of this business. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will receive, under the present inclosure, an act of Congress of the 7th, for promoting 
Captain Lee to the rank of Major of horse, and to 
the command of a separate corps. I perceive it is 
not expressed in the act; but I am warranted to as 
sure your Excellency it is the particular desire of 
Congress that suitable declarations of that gentleman's 
merit should be expressed, either within the intended 
commission, or by annexing to it the above-mentioned 
act, a certified copy of which Major Lee will receive 
by the present despatch.* 
</p><p>
Consideration of Colonel Lee and Major Swasey's 
application is postponed a few days for particular reasons. I shall direct the Secretary of Congress to 
collect the dates of the late resignations of Colonels 
in the Virginia line, and transmit an account to your Excellency, when obtained. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's last letter of the 4th is at present the subject of a special Committee. It is probable a report will be offered to-morrow morning. 
</p><p>
Previous to the receipt of your Excellency's ad 
vis, Congress had determined to make a purchase 
of divers articles, set forth in Captain Cottineau's 
schedule of his cargo ; and for this purpose a gentle 
man will proceed, to-morrow, on his journey to Cape 
Lookout, by whom your Excellency's letter will go 
forward. I have the honor to be, with the highest esteem and regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
