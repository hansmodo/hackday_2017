Yesterday evening, some time before sunset, Mr. Enders was announced, to our great surprise, as we 
knew he had been in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> all the week, having 
been transferred there instead of to Jackson, as he 
threatened. He was the most miserable, unhappy 
creature one could possibly imagine; even too melancholy for me to laugh at him, which expresses 
the last degree of wretchedness. To all our questions, 
he had but one answer, that he had had the most 
dreadful attack of "blues" ever since he was here 
Sunday; that he had waited every evening at the 
cars, expecting us, and at last, seeing that we had 
no intention of coming, he could no longer stand 
the temptation, so got permission to come down for 
a day to Port Hudson so he could come out to see 
us. . . . Before we could fairly get him cheerful, Will 
Carter and Ned Badger, who returned only this 
week from Kentucky, entered. Will was in a bad 
humor, and wanted to vent it on us ; so after waiting 
some time, he proposed that the two young men 
should go with him, pocketing at the same moment 
the cards which had won Miriam and saying they 
would have a nice game together, and just the rarest 
old whiskey! He looked around to see the effect 
produced. We girls did not move, but Mr. Enders 
said he must really return immediately to Port 
Hudson, and start for <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> from there in the 
night. Will thought it would be such a triumph over 
us to carry him off, that he insisted. They d have 
a fine time! cure the blues! etc. Ned was more 
than willing; and at last Mr. Enders said, Well! he felt just so desperate that he did not care what he did ; he believed he would go. I saw he was in 
a reckless humor, and that Will knew it, too, and I promised to make at least an effort to save him. Miriam spoke to him apart, but he said he had 
promised now; he must go. Will ran down triumphant to mount his horse, calling him to follow. All ran out to see him off, when Frank came back 
to tell me good-bye. I seized the opportunity, and 
didn't I plead! I told him I would not ask him to 
stay here, though he knew we would be happy to 
have him stay ; and begged him to go back to the 
camp, and leave Will alone. ... I suggested other 
resources; talked of his mother whom he idolizes, 
pleaded like a grandmother; and just as I wound up, 
came Will's voice from below, "Why the devil don't 
you come, Enders? Hurry!" He moved a step, 
looked at me; I dropped my head without a word. 
Here I must confess to the most consummate piece 
of acting; I am sorry, but as long as it saved him 
from doing what I knew he would have cause to 
regret, I am not ashamed of having tried it. Will 
called impatiently again, as he stood hesitating 
before me; I did not say, "Stay," I just gave the 
faintest sigh imaginable. ... He went down and told 
Will he would not go! Of course, Will went off in 
a rage with us.
