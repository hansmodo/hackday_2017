SIR, 
</p><p>
In the letter, which I had the honor to address 
your Excellency on the 15th ultimo, from <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, 
I proposed personally to have explained myself to 
Congress on the subject of the appointment of the 
21st of January last. But reflecting that, notwithstanding the entire confidence I entertain in the honor 
and candor of every individual member of Congress, 
it is nevertheless possible, that, through want of perspicuity in expressing myself, or misapprehension in 
others, what I may verbally deliver on the subject 
may be unintentionally construed, or repeated, in a 
manner widely different from my intentions, this 
consideration indus me to convey my determination 
in writing. 
Every reflection. Sir, I have made, since the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 24th January 
last, on the appointment mentioned in it, has con 
firmed the conclusion I very early drew, that I could 
not, consistently with my honor and reputation, accept of any employment under Congress, in a station 
either less honorable or less important than that which 
I once had the honor to hold; and, when the circumstances which led to my quitting the army shall re 
cur to Congress, I trust they will acquiesce in the 
propriety of this determination on my part. 
</p><p>
I do not mean, Sir, to convey the most distant 
idea, that I solicit a restoration to the rank and 
place I held in the army ; for, although it is true 
that I quitted it with reluctance, and that I have 
often since lamented that I was drove to the necessity of doing it, yet the delicacy I entertain with respect to the feelings of others, who might possibly 
conceive themselves injured by a perfect restoration 
of my rank, added to other considerations, have induced me to lay aside every wish for an appointment. But, Sir, as I am incapable of withholding 
any services my country may deem me capable of 
rendering ; as a reform in the civil departments of the 
army is of the highest necessity, and as Congress 
have thought proper to apply to me for my aid on 
the occasion, permit me to tender them an offer of 
my services, as a member of their House, on a Committee to consult with the Commander-in-chief, and 
the Heads of the several civil departments of the 
army, and to adopt such measures as will have a 
probable tendency to complete the great object of the 
resolutions of the 21st January. As a member of 
such a Committee, I should esteem it my duty to 
visit every part of the Continent, for the purpose of 
introducing good order and a proper economy, and 
should deem myself fully rewarded for every possible 
exertion, in the success of the business, and in the 
approbation of Congress. I am, &c.
