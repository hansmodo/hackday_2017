SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 14th instant is 
now before me, the contents of which I have duly considered. When it came to hand, our small sloop 
of war was out upon the cruise which I mentioned to your Excellency in a former letter. She 
hath since returned. The sending her on the enterprise you propose could not be done without some 
new and further powers from the General Assembly, 
which sat here last week ; and the nature of the 
business was such, that I did not think proper to 
lay it before so large a body. I therefore procured 
a committee to be appointed to transact all business 
necessary for the common safety during the recess 
of the Assembly, particularly with power to employ 
the two vessels of war in such service as they should 
think necessary. The committee is summoned to 
meet this day, before whom I shall lay your letter. 
At present the undertaking appears to me extremely difficult. The most suitable man we have for the 
purpose is confined to his bed by sickness. 
</p><p>
We have accounts that a number of vessels have 
sailed lately from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, which we apprehend are 
designed to plunder the stock along the coast. The 
General Assembly have ordered it all to be removed 
from all the islands in this Colony, excepting Rhode 
Island. We have now about three hundred men employed in that business. I am requested, by the 
General Assembly, to apply to you to give direction 
to the Commissary-General, that all the stock taken 
from the islands that are fit to kill be taken for the 
use of the army, in preference to any stock which 
is secure in the country. The drought hath been 
so severe along the sea-coast this summer, that there 
is no possibility of providing for this stock in any 
other way. 
</p><p>
The scarcity of coarse linens hath caused such a 
demand for tow-cloth for family use, that upon inquiry I find there is scarcely any of that article to 
be had in the Government at any rate. 
</p><p>
The vessel our small sloop was cruising for, arrived 
on the 28th instant at Norwich. She hath brought 
powder, lead, flints, and small arms. What quantity 
of each I am not certain. They are now on their 
way by land. 
</p><p>
This letter waits upon your Excellency by Captain 
Joseph Brown, who is an eminent merchant here, a 
true friend to the liberties of his country, extremely 
well respected among us, and noted for his superior 
mechanical genius. If he hath any thing to propose 
for the service of the common cause, I have no 
doubt of your paying attention to it, and giving it 
the weight it shall appear to you to deserve. I am, 
with very great esteem and regard, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient and 
</p><p>
Most humble servant, 
</p><p>
