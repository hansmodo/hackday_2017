<p><i>[Biographers Note:It was most important that the defenses of Charleston and Savannah
should be made as strong as possible.  The difficulties in the way
were many and great, but General Lee's perseverance overcame most of
them.  The result was that neither of those cities fell till the
close of the war, and a region of country was preserved to the
Confederacy necessary for the feeding of its armies.  Of course all
of this was not accomplished by my father alone in the four months
he was there; but the plans of defense he laid down were successfully
followed.]</i>

While in Savannah, he writes to my mother:

                                       Savannah, February 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>.
</p><p>
I wrote to you, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>, the day I left Coosawhatchie for this place.
I have been here ever since, endeavouring to push forward the work
for the defense of the city, which has lagged terribly and which ought
to have been finished.  But it is difficult to arouse ourselves from
ease and comfort to labour and self-denial.
</p><p>
Guns are scarce, as well as ammunition, and I shall have to break up
batteries on the coast to provide, I fear, for this city.  Our enemies
are endeavouring to work their way through the creeks that traverse
the impassable marshes stretching along the interior of the coast
and communicating with the sounds and sea, through which the Savannah
flows, and thus avoid the entrance of the river commanded by Fort
Pulaski.  Their boats require only seven feet of water to float them,
and the tide rises seven feet, so that at high water they can work
their way and rest on the mud at low.  They are also provided with
dredges and appliancances for removing obstructions through the creeks
in question, which cannot be guarded by batteries.  I hope, however,
we shall be able to stop them, and I daily pray to the Giver of all
victories to enable us to do so....  I trust you are all well and doing
well, and wish I could do anything to promote either.  I have more here
than I can do, and more, I fear, than I can well accomplish.  It is
so very hard to get anything done, and while all wish well and mean
well, it is so different to get them to act energetically and
promptly....  The news from Kentucky and Tennessee is not favourable,
but we must make up our minds to meet with reverses and overcome them.
I hope God will at last crown our efforts with success.  But the contest
must be long and severe, and the whole country has to go through much
suffering.  It is necessary we should be humbled and taught to be less
boastful, less selfish, and more devoted to right and justice to all
the world....  Always yours,
</p><p>
