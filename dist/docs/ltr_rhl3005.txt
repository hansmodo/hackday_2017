MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The resolves of Congress, that you will receive by 
this messenger, you may be assured are not intended, 
by any means, to obstruct your views a single moment. 
If your judgment should incline you to think that 
the troops had better march to head-quarters as quick 
as possible, you have only to order it, and it will 
give pleasure to every good man here. The business 
of speedily reenforcing you will not be obstructed, 
but accelerated ; because they now enter the city, 
where every day's stay is thirty days injury to the 
great purpose of strengthening your hands ; and 
should the enemy destine here, something like a military collection may produce a greater resort. If you 
will indulge my conjecture, I think they cannot purpose coming here, because the water securities against 
such a plan are really formidable, and the situation 
of the land, where the water obstructions are fixed, is 
such that great delay, and probable ruin, forbids the 
enterprise, as they cannot so fix land batteries as to 
remove the strong vessels that protect the chevaiix-de-frisCy added to the numerous fire-rafts and fire-ships 
that, in a narrow water, with strong current, may destroy their fleet. 
</p><p>
Your army, Sir, feeble as it is, and the North River, are more tempting objects, because they are not 
strong, and because the defeat of the one and the acquisition of the other, would avail our enemies greatly. 
</p><p>
My wishes are, Sir, and I think they correspond 
with the true interests of America, that you should 
quickly be possessed of a strong army ; that your 
powers might be such as to gratify your wishes of 
crushing our enemies, before an addition of strength 
to them may render the business more difficult and 
uncertain. I think I well know your situation, and, 
from your excellent disposition, I know your feelings; 
and I do most ardently wish to make the former 
good, and to render the latter agreeable ; and there 
fore whenever I can know either from yourself, all 
the powers I possess shall be exerted to accomplish 
both. The troops of Maryland are now under inoculation, and so are about one thousand Virginians from 
<a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> to Wilmington inclusive. Here, we sup 
pose, may be near one thousand of all kinds, who, 
by the new plan of encampment, will be in tents as 
quickly as the physicians can discharge them, or the 
officers collect them from this attractive scene of debauch and amusement. With every hearty wish for 
your health and prosperity, I remain, dear Sir, 
Most affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
