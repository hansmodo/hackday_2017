Tacoma Wash. <br> 4/27 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1919</a> <br><br> Dear Old Pal- <br> Well I suppose that by this time you are discharged and back on the little ranch. 
And never so glad of anything in your life. Well I went down to see the 361st 
come in yesterday. I was in hopes that they might send you here and then to Cal. 
But I couldn’t locate you. So I decided that you must have went directly to Cal. 
Well if you just had old Bob Lee where you could tell him a war story or two you 
sure could throw the fear of god into him. He would think that you were a regular. 
Well Humph I answered your card that you sent just after you got back to you [unintelligible]. 
But I don’t suppose you received my letter as by the time you would have gotten 
it you no doubt were on your way back to the good old USA. Well I got in a little 
over six months of training in the 38th F.A. But got my discharge Jan 24th and 
strait way on Feb 6th took upon myself a wife and a cook. And believe me boy she 
is some cook to. You just come up and live with us a month or so and find out. 
She will make you forget all the old accumulated chow and colored water you had 
to put up with in the army. They gave the boys quite a send off here yesterday. 
But I think that they would all have much rather have sent strait to camp and 
been allowed to do [unintelligible] [unintelligible] for a day or two. They had 
from 3 o’clock when they got here until seven, four hours and then had to beat 
it for camp. Well Humph I am working at the same old graft again. Cleaning old 
dirty clothes I am head cleaner for the Pantatorium [unintelligible] Works here. 
Have been working for a little over two months. I go to work at 8a.m. and quit 
at 4:30 p.m. and at noon [unintelligible] and drag down $175.00 a month as long 
as I can pull the wool over there eyes. And if they get to thinking I am good 
it will cost them more money. Well Humph let us hear from you and tell us all 
the details. Write soon. <br><br> Your Pal and His Wife Sutt.
