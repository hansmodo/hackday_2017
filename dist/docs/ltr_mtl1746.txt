MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : Your letter of Tuesday is just received. I have just written B. a note of 
thanks for his kindness ; also requesting the articles of which I gave you a list. Do see Keyes 
about it ; K. will have it done. And will you see that they are forwarded to me before you leave 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>? K. sent me a telegram on yesterday that eight names were on the circulars, and that 
they would be sent out immediately. What success do you think they will have? By all means 
assure K. & B. I have great confidence in them. These circulars must bring some money. Your 
letter made me quite sad. Talk to K. & B. of the grateful feelings I express towards them. Do 
pet up B., and see my things returned to me. Can you not, dear Lizzie, be employed in sewing for 
some of your lady friends in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> until December 1st ? If I ever get any money you will 
be well remembered, be assured. R. and a party of young men leave for the Rocky Mountains 
next Monday, to be absent three weeks. If the circulars- are sent out, of course the blasts will be 
blown over again. So R. is out of the way at the time, and money comes in, I will not care. Write 
the hour you receive this. I hope they will send out 150,000 circulars. Urge K. & B. to do this.

Your friend,
