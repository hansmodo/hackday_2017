Dear Uncle
</p><p>
I have often thought of writing to you but have deferred it until the present which is the latest news which I will be able of give you previous to leaving the United States. I found after arriving at Fort Columbus that Capt Taylor had left that post from that place. I proceeded to Fort Hamilton where he had taken up his quarters. Leaving there about ten days afterward, I traveled by land about 410 miles to Pittsburgh at which place I embarked on board the steam boat Suatara which conveyed me to Cincinnati. From that city I came to New Orleans on board the steamer Hendrik Hudson. I have just left New Orleans Barracks and am now being transported to Point Isabell which I expect to reach in about 2 or 3 days. I am at present with Captain Taylor (who is a Virginian and a very fine man) 27 men and 84 horses. The principal part of the company is in Mexico at present. I belong to a company of light Artillery which is frequently called flying artillery. In an action if all the officers of the company should be well I will have to carry dispatches being unfortunately too low to have a command. It is possible that before this time <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> has had another battle. If he has not already had one it is thought by men of experience that he will have before entering Monterey.

I sent uncle a few days since tell him if it is not there it to Clarksburg and tell (the merchant) that I wish him to give for it. It will be more to him than. (Note: the sentence contains several words that have been blacked out with ink, thus making the full meaning difficult to determine)
</p><p>
The weather here is more pleasant than it was in the north before I left there. The city of New Orleans is very healthy and there is no yellow fever in it at present. I am enjoying comparatively good health at present and I do not believe that I have the liver complaint but am under the impression that the disease is neuralgic.
</p><p>
Give my respects to my friends including your family of course and write to me as soon as you [can] ascertain where to direct your letter.

P.S. I have arrived in sight of Point Isabel Texas and am now at anchor in a strong gale. The news came aboard yesterday that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> would be ready for a battle on yesterday. The intelligence was by letter from Col. Whiting. I expect soon to start up the Rio Grande by steam for the purpose of joining the main body of the army as soon as possible.
