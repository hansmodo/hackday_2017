My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Were you but such a man as Julius Caesar, or the 
King of Prussia, I should almost be sorry for you at 
the end of the great tragedy where you are acting 
such a part. But, with my dear General, I rejoice 
at the blessings of a peace where our noble ends 
have been secured. Remember our Valley-Forge 
times ; and, from a recollection of past dangers and 
labors, we shall be still more pleased at our present 
comfortable situation. What a sense of pride and satisfaction I feel, when I think of the times that 
have determined my engaging in the American cause ! 
</p><p>
As for you, my dear General, who truly can say 
you have done all this, what must your virtuous and 
good heart feel, on the happy instant when the revolution you have made is now firmly established ! 
I cannot but envy the happiness of my grandchildren, when they will be about celebrating and worshipping your name. To have one of their ancestors 
among your soldiers, to know he had the good fortune to be the friend of your heart, will be the eternal honor in which they shall glory ; and to the 
eldest of them, as long as my posterity will last, I 
shall delegate the fiivor you have been pleased to 
confer upon my son George. 
</p><p>
At the prospect of a peace, I had prepared to go 
to America. You know me too well, my dear General, not to be sensible of the pleasure I anticipated 
in the hope to embrace you, and to be reunited to 
my fellow-soldiers. Never did any thing please me 
so much as the delightful prospect I had before me. 
But, on a sudden, I have been obliged to defer my 
darling plan; and, as I have at last been blessed 
with a letter of yours, I know you approve of my 
lengthening my furlough upon political accounts. The 
inclosed copy of a letter to Congress, and my official 
letter to Mr. Livingston, which I request him to communicate to you, will fully inform you of the reasons 
that urge me to post off to Madrid. From there it 
will be better for me to go to Paris; and in the 
month of June I will embark for America. Happy, 
ten times happy, shall I be in embracing my dear 
General, my father, my best friend, whom I love 
with an affection and a respect, which I too well feel 
not to know it is impossible to me to express it. 
</p><p>
In my letters to Congress you -will also see, that, 
independent of the plans I had been permitted to 
propose to you, in the execution of which we were 
to have an immense naval and land force, it had 
been at last obtained I should enter Canada. I had 
my hopes to embrace you at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a>, or at least to 
be met there by a detachment from the army. The 
necessity of a diversion was the ground upon which 
we had obtained the Eling of Spain's consent. But 
now those schemes are over, and we must rejoice in 
the happiness of those you have rescued from the 
hands of British tyranny. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear General, that you are going to enjoy some ease and quiet, permit me to propose a 
plan to you, which might become greatly beneficial 
to the black part of mankind. Let us unite in purchasing a small estate, where we may try the experiment to free the negroes, and use them only as tenants. Such an example as yours might render it a 
general practice ; and if we succeed in America, I will 
cheerfully devote a part of my time to render the 
method fashionable in the West Indies. If it be a 
wild scheme, I had rather be mad this way, than to 
be thought wise in the other task. 
</p><p>
I am so anxious to hear from you, my dear General, and to let you hear from me, that I have sent 
my own servant with a vessel, upon which I have 
prevailed to set him ashore on the Maryland coast. 
Before I leave France, I hope I may receive your 
answers, and I will be directed where to find you on 
my arrival. Upon that intelligence I depend to regulate my course, and if you are at home, 1 shall 
steer for the Bay of Chesapeake. 
</p><p>
Your influence, my dear General, cannot be better 
employed than in inducing the people of America to 
strengthen their Federal Union. It is a work in 
which it behooves you to be concerned. I look upon 
it as a necessary measure. Depend upon it, my dear 
General, that European politics will be apt to create 
divisions among the States. Now is the time when 
the powers of Congress must be fixed, the boundaries 
determined, and articles of confederation revised. It 
is a work in which every well-wisher to America 
must desire to be concerned. It is the finishing 
stroke, that is wanting to the perfection of the temple of liberty. 
</p><p>
As to the army, my dear General, what will be its 
fate ? I hope their country will be grateful. Should 
the reverse be the case, I should indeed feel very 
unhappy. Will part of the army be kept together ? 
If not, I hope we shall not forfeit our noble titles of 
officers and soldiers in the American army ; so that, 
in case of danger, we may be called upon from every 
quarter, and reunite in the defence of a country, 
which the army has so effectually, so heroically served. I long to know what measures will be taken. 
Indeed, my dear General, I depend upon your goodness for a very minute letter, not only on public accounts, but also because I want to be acquainted 
with every one of your personal concerns. 
</p><p>
Adieu, adieu, my dear General Had the Spaniards 
got common sense, I could have dispensed with that 
cursed trip to Madrid; but I am called upon by a 
sense of my duty to America. I must go, and defer 
the happy voyage. My best, most affectionate respects wait upon Mrs. Washington. Now we are going to quarrel ; for I must urge your returning with 
me to France. Her accompanying you there, is the 
best way I know of to compromise the matter; and 
so she will make Madame de Lafayette and me perfectly happy. 
</p><p>
I request your Excellency will please to present 
my compliments to Tilghman, George, and all the 
family. Remember me to all my friends in the army. 
I am so hurried in sending the vessel away, that I 
will write to them by other opportunities. They know 
my love to them, and I have a grateful sense of their 
friendship. Be so kind, my dear General, as to remember me to your much-respected mother. Her 
happiness I heartily partake. Adieu, once more, my 
dear General. With every sentiment of love and respect, I am forever. 
</p><p>
Your most devoted and affectionate friend,
