ALL well you will send these papers to some 
printer when you have done with them. 
We have found that the only way of guarding 
against fevers is to ride. We accordingly mount our 
horses every day. But the weather through the whole 
spring and most of the summer, has been very dull, 
damp, cold, very disagreeable and dangerous. But 
shaking on horseback guards pretty well against it.

I am going to dinner with a Duke and a Dutchess 
and a number of Ambassadors and Senators in all 
the luxury of this luxurious world ; but how much 
more luxurious it would be to me to d ne upon roast 
beef with Parson Smith, Dr. Tufts, or Norton Quincy ! 
or upon rusticoat potatoes with Portia! Ah ! Oh ! hi, 
ho, hum, and her daughter and sons !
