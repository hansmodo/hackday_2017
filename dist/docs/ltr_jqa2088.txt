You observe that there are many people who wish to raise a jealousy between <a href="/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague">Mr. Jay</a> and another public character 
nearly connected with us. It appears to me very probable that such attempts will be made, and I hope with you that 
they will prove abortive ; but if I have one wish in my heart more forcible than any other, it is that the occasion for which 
you suppose the plan is laid may never happen. Who ever may be the successor of the present first magistrate will 
hold a situation so uncomfortable and so dangerous, that there is nothing in its possession to make it desirable. I am 
so far from looking on that place as an object worthy of ambition, that if my unequivocal wishes could decide the 
point on the supposition of the contingency, which we all deprecate, the election would be declined in the most decisive and explicit manner.

In all ages of the world and in all countries, instability has been the most essential characteristic of popular opinions. 
It is so in America, and will infallibly become so more and more in proportion as the increase of population shall multiply the quantity of opinions. The revolutions of popular 
opinions are to be considered as things of course, though they are misfortunes to the individuals, who are the subjects 
of them. We are however all much alike in this respect, and the man who has never been at different periods strenuously attached to opposite opinions, would be one of the 
rarest phenomena in creation. . . .

October 5. ... The treatment of <a href="/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague">Mr. Jay</a> is certainly such as does no honor to the American name. It appears to me 
evident enough, that very little of the outcry of which the treaty is made the pretence is meant to bear against that 
instrument. There is a combination of personal envy of the man, of factious enmity against the government, and of 
eternal foreign influence operating unseen, all assuming the mark of pure and exalted patriotism, to impose upon the 
people ; that the mask should be assumed is neither new nor strange ; but that it should still answer its purpose 
would be surprizing, if any thing could surprize. . . .
