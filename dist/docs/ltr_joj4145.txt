Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with yours of the 14th ult. and 
also with the one which accompanied the set of your 
Geography, for which be pleased to accept my thanks. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to learn, that you will endeavour at 
least to prepare for a history of the American revolution. 
To obtain competent and exact information on the subject 
is not the least arduous part of the task ; it will require 
much time, patient perseverance, and research. As the 
revolution was accomplished by the councils and efforts of 
the Union, and by the auxiliary councils and efforts of 
each individual State or colony, it appears to me that your 
inquiries will necessarily be divided into those two departments; the first of thorn will of course include foreign 
affairs, and both of them will naturally divide into two 
others; viz. the civil and the military. Each of these, 
you know, comprehends several distinct heads, which are 
obvious. 
</p><p>
So much of our colonial history as casts light on the 
revolution, viewed under its different aspects, and considered in all its anterior relations, will be essential. I 
think our colonial history is strongly marked by discriminating circumstances relative to our political situation and 
feelings, at three different periods : 1st, down to the revolution under King William ; 2d, from thence to the year 
<a href='/results.php?year=1763'>1763</a> ; and 3d, from that year to the union of the colonies 
in <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. Want of leisure will not permit me to go into 
details. 
</p><p>
As to documents — public and private journals of Congress — the papers mentioned or alluded to in them, such 
as certain reports of committees ; letters to and from civil 
and military officers, ministers, agents, state-governors, &c; 
the proceedings of the standing committees for marine, 
commercial, fiscal, political, and foreign affairs — all merit 
attention. 
</p><p>
The journals and papers of State conventions, and councils of safety, and of some of the standing and other committees, during the revolutionary government, contain much 
interesting information. 
</p><p>
There are also diaries and memoirs, and private letters, 
which would give some aid and light to a sagacious and 
cautious inquirer ; for experience has convinced me, that 
they are entitled to no other respect or attention than what 
they derive from the well-established characters of the 
writers for judgment, accuracy, and candour. As to characters, I have, throughout the revolution, known some who 
passed for more than they were worth, and others who 
passed for less. On this head, great circumspection is particularly requisite. It is to be regretted, but so I believe 
the fact to be, that except the Bible, there is not a true history in the world. Whatever may be the virtue, discernment, and industry of the writers, I am persuaded, that 
truth and error (though in different degrees) will imperceptibly become and remain mixed and blended, until they 
shall be separated for ever by the great and last refining 
fire. 
</p><p>
I remain, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your very obedient servant, 
</p><p>
