DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
On Friday evening I received a line from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a>, a copy whereof I have the honor to inclose. By the contents your Excellency will perceive, that 
we have reasons to believe his next will announce his arrival at Crown Point. 
</p><p>
Yesterday morning <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> introduced a Mr. Avery to me, who applied to me for money to carry 
on the Commissary-General's department here. I asked if Mr. Livingston was superseded, and begged to 
see how he (Avery) was authorized to act here. He 
showed me a commission from <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a>, the 
Commissary-General, with instructions annexed, appointing him Deputy-Commissary in Canada, and the 
instructions were correspondent to such appointment. 
I told him his commission did not, by any means, 
supersede Mr. Livingston s, and until that was done, 
I must consider Mr. Livingston as the Deputy-Commissary-General here, and that all warrants for money to carry on that department here must he drawn 
in his favor, unless <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a> himself was present. 
</p><p>
He assured me that it was <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a>'s intention that he (Avery) should have the sole management, and that Mr. Livingston was only to be considered as a contractor. I sent for Mr. Livingston, 
who produced a letter of the 25th instant from Mr. 
Trumbull, directly contradictory to what Mr. Avery 
had asserted ; upon which he declared that <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a> had informed him, that Congress had given him full 
power to make any arrangement he thought proper, 
and displace whom he pleased, and that it was his 
intention, by giving him (Avery) that commission, to 
supersede Mr. Livingston. To which Mr. Livingston 
answered, that, although <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a> had 110 power 
to remove him unless authorized so to do by congress, as he held his commission immediately from 
that body, yet, if <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a> had expressed any 
such intention, he would immediately resign, and he 
would put the question to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a>. I observed 
to Mr. Avery that nothing in his commission, or the 
instructions annexed, authorized him to say what 
he did; that <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a>'s letter to Mr. Livingston 
flatly contradicted it; that if he remained with the 
army, provided it was not in Canada, he must be 
subordinate to Mr. Livingston, and obey his orders, 
which he chose not to do, and is now going down. 
</p><p>
I advised him to remain until the affair was deter 
mined, and candidly told him that I should try to keep Mr. Livingston in the employment if he chose 
it, because, admitting that their abilities and integrity 
were perfectly equal, Mr . Livingston's conduct had 
met my approbation, and that his great family connections in this county had enabled him to carry on 
the service, when others could not have done it, of 
which I gave instances. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> was present, 
and acquiesced in the propriety of what I observed. 
I was, therefore, greatly surprised to be informed, 
that he should tell Mr. Avery that he had nothing 
to say here, but that as soon as he came to the army he would employ him. I say I was greatly surprised, because <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> knew that the army 
was no longer in Canada, and because I did not 
know that he then claimed a right to control my 
orders with respect to the army, even if it should be 
at Crown Point ; nor could I imagine he thought so, 
as your Excellency's instructions to him gave, as I 
conceive, not the least color for it. Your last letter 
to me holds up a contrary idea, and so does every 
resolution of Congress hitherto transmitted to me ; 
but that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> conceived, and still does, that 
the army is immediately under his command, I had, 
a very few hours after, the most convincing proof of, 
as your Excellency will observe from the inclosed 
paper, which I hastily drew up immediately after the 
discourse, and which I desired <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> to read, 
that no misunderstanding might arise for want of recollecting what had been said, and which he acknowledges contains the substance of what passed between us. 
</p><p>
By your Excellency's instructions to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, 
he is empowered to appoint a Quartermaster-General 
in Canada. I observed, this morning, that I believed 
it was founded on a supposition that Colonel Camp-bell was then about quitting Canada, for that I could 
not imagine that an officer being "ordered to congress to settle his accounts" deprived him of his employments ; that Colonel Campbell was originally appointed to this department/ and that Canada now 
being made a separate one, and the command of it 
given to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, he could., under the powers 
he had, appoint whom he pleased to act there; but 
that, . unfortunately for us, the evacuation of that 
country by our troops had taken place, and that I 
must and should consider Colonel Campbell as the 
Deputy Quartermaster-General on this side of Canada. 
</p><p>
If Congress intended that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> should 
command the Northern army, wherever it may be, 
as he assures me they did, it ought to have been 
signified to me, and I should then have immediately 
resigned the command to him ; but until such intention is properly conveyed to me, I never can. I 
must, therefore, entreat your Excellency to lay this 
letter before Congress, that they may clearly and Explicitly signify their intentions, to avert the dangers 
and evils that may arise from a disputed command; 
for, after what <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> has said, the line must 
be clearly drawn, as I shall, until then, stand upon 
punctilios with <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, that I would otherwise 
with pleasure waive ; but that the service may not 
be retarded, nor suffer the least from a difference of 
opinion between <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> and me, I have deter 
mined to remain here, although I had, before this 
affair came to light, mentioned to him my intentions 
of going up with him. 
</p><p>
As both <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> and myself mean to be 
candid, and wish to have the matter settled without 
any of that chicane which would disgrace us as officers and men, we have agreed to speak plain, and 
to show each other what we have written to you 
upon the occasion ; and he has accordingly read the 
whole of what I have above said. . 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> has shown me the resolutions of Congress of the 17th ultimo, which confirm me in the opinion I have entertained, 
that he was only to command the army in Canada, and that I had no control upon him when there.
</p><p>
Your Excellency may be assured of my best exertions to prevent the enemy from penetrating into these Colonies. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> is in sentiment with 
me on the mode ; that of increasing our naval strength, and fortifying some advantageous spot on the east side of Lake Champlain, either opposite to 
<a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, or between that and Crown Point. 
</p><p>
Part of the militia from this Colony is marched up ; none of the others are yet moved. Their tardiness will greatly distress us, as we have much, very much, to do, and few men to do it with. 
</p><p>
The cannon sent by <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>Colonel Knox</a></a> arrived yesterday; and, although the Indians have deferred the treaty to the middle of this month, yet I have thought it advisable to take post at Fort Stanwix ; 
and all the stores are moving from here to-day, and will, I hope, leave Schenectady on Wednesday morning. The Commissioners of Indian Affairs have prepared a message to the Six Nations, giving the reasons why we take post at Fort Stanwix. This will, however, not be sent until every thing is so far advanced that there may be no danger in coimnimbating to them my intentions. 
</p><p>
Should the enemy advance, and we be under the 
necessity of calling forth the militia nearest to us, 
we shall be at a loss for ball and buckshot. I wish, 
therefore, to have twenty-five rounds a-piece for ten 
thousand men sent up the soonest possible, if it can 
anywhere be procured, with a proportionate quantity 
of cartridge-paper, and two tons of oakum. 
</p><p>
If any cutlasses, stinkpots, and handgrenades can 
be got, I beg they may also be sent for the use of 
our armed vessels. 
</p><p>
One hundred thousand of the dollars brought up 
by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> are ordered to the army; better 
than half of the other are already expended, nor 
will any be left in two or three days. 
</p><p>
Mr. Duane informed me, and gave me leave to 
make use of his name, that the five hundred thou 
sand voted by Congress the 22d of May for this department, were actually charged, and he fears that 
they may have met with some accident on the way up. 
</p><p>
I have ordered the silver to be kept in chests, except about three thousand pounds, which we borrowed here, and must now be repaid. 
</p><p>
Four o clock, P. M. I am this moment favored with your Excellency's letter of the 27th ultimo, in closing a copy of a resolution of Congress of the 
24th. I have immediately an opportunity of forwarding copies thereof to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a></a> and Mr. Edwards. The latter has already received one month's 
advance wages for the Stockbridge company, which, 
I suppose, is by this time paid to them, as he in 
formed me that they were to be here on Wednesday 
or Thursday next. I am afraid it will give great 
umbrage, if they are immediately discharged; but, as 
the order is positive, I dare not presume to defer 
complying with it. I shall, however, request Mr. Ed 
wards to do it in a manner that will give the least 
offence. 
</p><p>
I wish Colonel Francis and Colonel Wolcott were 
immediately ordered up to attend the conference at 
the <a href='/results.php?city=german flats' rel='city'>German Flats</a> on the 15th instant, as I propose 
going to Crown Point to-morrow, having, upon further 
consultation with <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> 
since writing the foregoing, determined upon it; and 
this journey may detain me so long as to prevent 
my attendance, in which case there will be only two 
Commissioners present. 
</p><p>
I am, dear General, most respectfully, your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="me">PHILIP SCHUYLER</a>.
