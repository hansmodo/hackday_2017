One year ago, in my little room in the Camp Street house, I sat shivering over Tennyson and my desk, 
selfishly rejoicing over the departure of a year that had brought pain and discomfort only to me, and 
eagerly welcoming the dawning of the New One whose first days were to bring death to George and Gibbes, and whose latter part was to separate me 
from Miriam, and brings me news of Jimmy's approaching marriage. O sad, dreary, fearful Old Year! I see you go with pain! Bitter as you have 
been, how do we know what the coming one has in store for us? What new changes will it bring? Which 
of us will it take? I am afraid of eighteen sixty-five, and have felt a vague dread of it for several years past. Nothing remains as it was a few months ago. 
Miriam went to Lilly, in the Confederacy, on the iQth of October (ah! Miriam!), and mother and I have been boarding with Mrs. Postlethwaite ever 
since. I miss her sadly. Not as much, though, as I would were I less engaged. For since the first week in August, I have been teaching the children for 
Sister; and since we have been here, I go to them every morning instead of their coming to me. Starting out at half-past eight daily, and returning a little 
before three, does not leave me much time for melancholy reflections. And there is no necessity for indulging in them at present; they only give pain.
