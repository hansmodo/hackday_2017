I seize a moment of leisure to thank you, my dear sir, 
for your obliging favours of the 21st and 26th of April. 
My friendship for you will always make me take pleasure 
in cultivating the esteem and confidence of which you so 
politely assure me. 
</p><p>
You give an affecting summary of the causes of the 
national evils we feel, and the still greater we have reason 
to apprehend. To me it appears that our affairs are in a 
very delicate situation ; and what is not the least to be 
lamented is, that many people think they are in a very 
flourishing way ; and seem in a great measure insensible to 
the danger with which we are threatened. If Britain should 
be able to make a vigorous campaign in America this 
summer, in the present depreciation of our money, scantiness of supplies, want of virtue and want of exertion, 'tis 
hard to say what may be the consequence. 
</p><p>
It is a melancholy consideration that any concerned in 
the conduct of public affairs should discover an indifference 
to the state of our currency. Nothing, in my opinion, can 
be more manifest, than that if something effectual be not 
done to restore its credit, it will in a short time either cease 
to circulate altogether, or circulate so feebly as to be utterly 
incapable of drawing out the resources of the country. 
This is nearly the case now. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
