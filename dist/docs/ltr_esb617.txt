Saturday Morning

My Darling Husband.
</p><p>
I am in that wonderful and (to me) almost unprecedented situation when I have plenty of leisure for letter writing and I mean to bring up all of my old [...]. I do not hear regularly from you now that I am here your letters going first to Wakeman. I received a satchel of clothing from Lucy yesterday evening enclosing a letter from you and one from my cousin in Ohio.

She writes me that her only sister [...] died since I was last there and that her brother is declining in consumption - her mother is [...] dead and she will be left quite alone save for her father and her husband and children.

I feel quite uneasy at the time that in being consumed here for I have not finished the photograph of Ella and I have made all my arrangements to leave Wakeman about the 7 or 8 next month - if my money reaches me in season.

This morning after my visit at the Dr.'s office I took a long walk and car ride through the city - called at Charlie Lunn's place of business and delivered a letter which his mother had sent - He is Mrs. Learie's second child. Have engaged to go to church with him tomorrow.

My time would have hung very heavy had not Dr. Sanders taken pity on me by taking me out riding when he went to visit his patients yesterday and this evening at 4 o'clock. He has promised to take me out again. I felt a little hesitation about accepting his offer and therefore consulted the matron of the hospital, who thought there was no objection to it - I so seldom ride by private conveyance that it has been a real treat to me. I think I will close this letter being as I hope to send it by one of the [ ...]. Did you receive the letter that went yesterday. With loving [...].
