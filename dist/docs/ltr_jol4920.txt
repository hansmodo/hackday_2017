I barely hinted to you, my dearest father, my desire 
to augment the Continental forces from an untried 
source. I wish I had any foundation to ask for an 
extraordinary addition to those favours which I have 
already received from you. I would solicit you to 
cede me a number of your able bodied men slaves, 
instead of leaving me a fortune. 
</p><p>
I would bring about a two-fold good ; first, I would 
advance those who are unjustly deprived of the rights 
of mankind to a state which would be a proper gradation between abject slavery and perfect liberty, and 
besides I would reinforce the defenders of liberty 
with a number of gallant soldiers. Men, who have 
the habit of subordination almost indelibly impressed 
on them, would have one very essential qualification 
of soldiers. I am persuaded that if I could obtain 
authority for the purpose, I would have a corps of such 
men trained, uniformly clad, equip'd and ready in 
every respect to act at the opening of the next campaign. The ridicule that may be thrown on the 
color, I despise, because I am sure of rendering essential service to my country. I am tired of the languor 
with which so sacred a war as this is carried on. My 
circumstances prevent me from writing so long a 
letter as I expected and wish'd to have done on a 
subject which I have much at heart. I entreat you 
to give a favorable answer to 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate
