CAMP NEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, Jan. 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Brother : I received yours of Jan. 2, to-day, and 
being in camp with some leisure hasten to answer. I 
shall be glad to meet Gen. Banks on many accounts, 
because of his known intelligence and high character 
and because we have been long expecting him. I was 
hurried down the river with positive orders to get away 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> December 18, to co-operate with Grant to 
come down by land and Banks to ascend the river. I 
was on time and made every effort to carry <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, 
but unsuccessfully. Hearing nothing from Banks or 
Grant, and being superseded by McClernand, I proposed 
that we should go to the Arkansas and attack the Post 
from which the enemy threatened our rear and line 
of communications. We succeeded perfectly there, and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> came down and met us at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=napoleon" rel="city">Napoleon</a> and 
hurried us back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, on the theory that Banks 
might be here, disappointed at our non-appearance. 
</p><p>
So here we are again, but not a word of Banks. This 
time instead of landing up the Yazoo we have lauded on 
the Louisiana side and I occupy a neck of low ground 
enclosed with a high levee directly in front of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>. 
Last summer when <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> was invested by our troops 
from below a canal was dug across a narrow neck with 
the purpose of turning the river so as to leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> 
out in the cold. The river is now rising rapidly and 
already fills the canal, which however is a narrow ditch 
the water flows across it, but thus far it shows no 
symptoms of cutting a channel, but, on the contrary, 
threatens to overflow the low ground embraced in the 
levee. All my soldiers are busy day and night in throwing up a levee on the inside of this canal to prevent the 
water overflowing us. My right extends along the levee 
below <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, and I have some guns below, which 
will prevent the enemy's boats coming up to town. 
Since I broke the railroad leading west most of the 
necessary supplies to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> have come from Eed 
River by water, and we now stop this ; but as they hold 
Port Hudson, preventing Banks coming up, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> prevents our boats going down, they hold substantially a long reach of the river embracing the mouth 
of Red River. Last night my extreme right brigade, 
Blair's, captured a ferry boat which came in for wood, 
not suspecting our presence. So we have also our boat 
below <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> I have not much faith in the canal. 
It starts after the current has been turned, and I doubt 
if the canal will draw in a volume and depth of water 
sufficient to cut a new channel, and if it do the enemy 
will simply shift his guns to Warrenton, a point on the 
same range of hills, below the mouth of our canal at 
last we must attack the enemy in his strong position. 
Outnumbering us in every sense in men, in guns, and 
holding a position stronger than Gibraltar. . . . 
</p><p>
We must get on land before we can fight. That was 
my attempt and the point I chose is the only one between 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> and Haines Bluff we may attempt the latter, 
and I think it is the safest place, but on this side of^the 
river we do no good whatever, for the Mississippi is an 
ugly stream to ford at this season of the year. 
</p><p>
Unless you enact a law denying to all citizens between 
the ages of 18 and 45 who do not enlist and serve 3 years 
faithfully, all right of suffrage, or to hold office after the 
war is over, you will have trouble. The Army growls a 
good deal at the apathy of the nation, at home quite 
comfortable and happy yet pushing them forward on all 
/ sorts of desperate expeditions. [Newspapers can now 
turn armies against their leaders. Every officer and soldier knows I pushed the attack on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> as far as 
they wanted to venture, and if others think differently, 
they naturally say, Why not come down and try ? . . . 
</p><p>
Two years have passed and the rebel flag still haunts 
our nation's capital our armies enter the best rebel 
territory and the wave closes in behind, scarcely leaving 
a furrow mark behind. The utmost we can claim is that 
our enemy respects our power to do them physical harm 
more than they did at first ; but as to loving us any more, 
it were idle even to claim it. Our armies are devastating 
the land and it is sad to see the destruction that attends 
our progress we cannot help it. Farms disappear, 
houses are burned and plundered, and every living animal killed and eaten. General officers make feeble efforts 
to stay the disorder, but it is idle. . . . 
</p><p>
The South abounds in corn, cattle and provisions and 
the progress in manufacturing shoes and cloth for the 
soldiers is wonderful. They are as well supplied as we 
and they have an abundance of the best cannon, arms 
and ammunition. In long range cannon they rather 
excel us and their regiments are armed with the verybest Enfield rifles and cartridges, put up at Glasgow, 
Liverpool and their new Southern armories, and I still 
say they have now as large armies in the field as we. 
They give up cheerfully all they have. 'I still see no 
end or even the beginning of the end. . . ._ 
</p><p>
The early actors and heroes of the war will be swept 
away, and those who study its progress, its developments, 
and divine its course and destiny will be most appreciated. We are in for the war, and must fight it out, cost 
what it may. As tp making popularity out of it, it is 
simply ridiculouglind all who attempt it will be swept 
as chaff before Ibhe wind. . . . 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
