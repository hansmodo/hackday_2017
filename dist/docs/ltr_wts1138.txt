Dear Brother : Troops are moving up through Arkansas for Missouri. It looks as though they want to 
swap countries with us. It is about time the North 
understood the truth. That the entire South, man, 
woman and child are against us, armed and determined. 
It will call for a million men for several years to put 
them down. They are more confident than ever, none 
seem to doubt their independence, but some hope to conquer the northwest. My opinion is there never can be 
peace and we must fight it out. I guess you now see 
how, from the very first I argued, that you all underestimated the task. None of you would admit for a 
moment that after a year's fighting the enemy would 
still threaten <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>. 
We ought to hold fast to the Mississippi as a great 
base of operation. I should regard the loss of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> 
as more fatal to our future success than the capture by 
them of Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Your brigade is 
now with Buell. I don't understand his move, but now 
suppose he will cross Green Eiver and fight north of it. 
Still I don't see exactly his strategy or tactics. The 
passage of the enemy north of us, leaving us among a 
hostile population, was a bold and successful movement 
and will give them great credit in Europe. You doubtless, like most Americans, attribute our want of success 
to bad generals. I do not. With us you insist the 
boys, the soldiers, govern. ^They must have this or that 
or will cry down their leaders in the newspapers, so no 
general can achieve much. , They fight or run as they 
please and of course it is the general's fault. Until 
this is cured, we must not look for success. But on 
the whole, things look more favorable than at any 
former time, as the numbers engaged on both sides are 
approaching the occasion.

The war is, which race, that of the North or South, 
shall rule America. The greatest danger North is division and anarchy, but I hope the pressure from the 
South will keep all united until our armies begin to 
have some discipline and see how important it is to 
success. 
</p><p>
Our fort here is nearly done, I have 20 heavy guns 
mounted and about 30 field pieces, 7000 Infantry and 
600 Cavalry. Some of my regiments are now in fine 
drill and discipline and all are doing well. We are all, 
however, tied down till events elsewhere develop.

Affectionately yours,
