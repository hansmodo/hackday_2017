Wednesday night we passed two or three lighthouses and a number of sailing craft. At 4 A.M. we put another poor fellow overboard. Three hours later we passed the narrow entrance to the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> Harbor, where the fort is situated. On reaching the quarantine ground we were detained two hours in taking the sick aboard to the hospital, six in number, and also one dead man, making 15 or 16 deaths aboard. After this was finished, and just as we supposed we were going on to New York, the captain informed us that we were under quarantine for 24 hours, and if any were taken sick during that time, we would be detained longer, but that we could go ashore and remain within the hospital grounds, with a high wall surrounding them. We were very much disappointed and some made their escape and went on to the city. I succeeded in getting ashore, where I remained until 2 o'clock, when I was given permission by the hospital overseer, on giving my parole to return in the morning, to go to the city.

Last night with a single exception was the first time I have slept in a civilized bed for more than three years. It was quite refreshing to turn in between two snow-white sheets and to lay one's head upon a smooth, soft pillow. I slept only tolerably well, arose early and took breakfast, returned to the quarantine grounds, and obtained my baggage from the steamer. Most of the passengers had rid the boat of their presence somehow or other and the few who remained on board were anxiously waiting to be set at liberty. Two of those whom we took ashore sick have since died, making 16 or 17 deaths in all. The others are improving rapidly.

The balance of the passengers were permitted to leave the vessel at noon, and thus ends the sea voyage.
