My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
We are just about to march. Seventy miles are 
between us and King's Ferry, where we shall probably 
cross the North river. The last intelligence from the 
enemy is, that they had passed the breach which the 
sea has made between Sandy Hook and the main, and 
had taken up their bridge after them. They were 
embarking with the greatest expedition. They left a 
number of waggons behind them, and cut the throats 
of a great many horses. Three signal guns were fired 
from the fleet the day before yesterday morning, and 
they appeared to be all under weigh yesterday. 
</p><p>
Col. Morgan informs us that he had taken 30 
prisoners, and received 100 deserters. I suppose he 
counts from the time of his having been detached. 
I wish I had leisure, and something more interesting 
to write to you, nly dear father ; but our rear has left 
the ground long since, and we must march. 
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
