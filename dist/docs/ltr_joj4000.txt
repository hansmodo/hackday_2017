Dear Colonel, 
</p><p>
When the clerk of the Congress gave me the printed 
papers which I enclosed you, he told me they contained the 
navy establishment. Whatever deficiencies there may be 
in them as to that matter, will I hope be supplied by the 
extract now enclosed. 
</p><p>
As to continental colours, the Congress have made no 
order as yet concerning them, and I believe the captains of 
their armed vessels have in that particular been directed 
by their own fancies and inclinations. I remember to have 
seen a flag designed for one of them, on which was extremely well painted a large rattlesnake, rearing his crest 
and shaking his rattles, with this motto, " Don't tread on 
me," but whether this device was generally adopted by the 
fleet, I am not able to say, — I rather think it was not. 
</p><p>
I am by no means without my apprehensions of danger 
from that licentiousness which in your situation is not uncommon ; nothing will contribute more to its suppression 
than a vigorous exertion of the powers vested in your 
Convention and Committee of Safety, at least till more 
regular forms can be introduced. The tenderness shown 
to some wild people on account of their supposed attachment to the cause, has been of disservice. Their eccentric 
behaviour, by passing unreproved, has gained countenance, 
and has lessened your authority, and diminished that dignity 
so essential and necessary to give weight and respect to 
your ordinances. Some o£ your own people are daily 
instigated (if not employed) to calumniate and abuse the 
whole province, and misrepresent all their actions and 
intentions. One in particular has had the impudence to 
intimate to certain persons that your battalions last campaign were not half full, and that Schaick's regiment had 
more officers than privates ; others report that you have 
all along supplied the men-of-war with whatever they 
pleased to have, and through them our enemies in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
By tales like these they pay their court to people who have 
more ostensible consequence than real honesty, and more 
cunning than wisdom. 
</p><p>
I am happy to find that our intermeddling in the affair of 
the test is agreeable to you. For god's sake resist all such 
attempts for the future. 
</p><p>
Your own discernment has pointed out to you the principle of Lord Stirling's advancement ; had the age of a 
colonel's commission been a proper rule, it would have 
determined in favour of some colonel at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, many 
of whose commissions are prior in date to any in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The spirit you betray on this occasion becomes a 
soldier. 
</p><p>
The enclosed copy of a resolve of Congress will, I hope, 
settle all doubts relative to rank, which may arise from 
your new commission. The consequence you drew from 
that circumstance was more ingenious than solid, for I can 
assure you that the Congress were not disposed to do any 
thing wrong or uncivil ; and I can also add, that your not 
having joined your regiment last summer has been explained to their satisfaction, as far as I am able to judge. 
"With respect to this, however, as well as some other matters, I shall defer particulars till we meet. In a word, with 
some men in these as in other times, a man must either be 
their tool and be despised, or act a firm disinterested part 
and be abused. The latter has in one or two matters 
been your fate, as well as that of many other good men. 
Adieu. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
