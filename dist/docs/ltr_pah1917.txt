SIR : The Regiment of Artillery commanded by Colonel Charles Harrison is yet in this State. They have been detained here, under leave of Congress, to 
do Duty at Portsmouth and York, near which Places the Enemy's Ships of War have been long hovering. At present, seven Men of War & three 
large Transports or provision Vessels, are in and near Hampton Road. The Troops of the State are so few, that the Defence of our maritime 
places will be precarious in the absence of that Regiment. 
</p><p>
Militia must in that Case be chiefly depended on, and their Skill in managing Cannon promises nothing effectual. But, reflecting on the necessity there 
may be of re-enforcing the army under your Excellency's Command, I trouble you with this, entreating you will be pleased to tell me whether that 
Regiment will be a desirable aid to you. 
</p><p>
If it is, perhaps Inoculation ought to be set about immediately. 
</p><p>
With the highest Regard I am, 
</p><p>
Sir, 
Your mo. obd Hble Serv, 
</p><p>

To His Excellency, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">GENERAL WASHINGTON</a>, at Head-Quarters. 
Per Express.
