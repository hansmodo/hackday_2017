MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received last evening your favor of the 5th instant. 
The votes of the electors in Connecticut and Rhode Island 
were unanimous it seems, as well as in this State. I have 
not heard any further, but we presume there was the same 
unanimity in New Hampshire, which if it be the case will I 
think do credit to New England. We expect nothing but 
the voice of faction from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and we know not enough 
what the disposition of the Southern States was. 
</p><p>
I gave you in my last some account of the Governor's 
having at length succeeded in overthrowing the players ; 
but some other circumstances have taken place which at 
that time I had not heard. Two days after the arrest of the 
player which I mentioned in my last, those who still remained had announced another play, but upon being advised 
by their own friends to desist, they postponed the perform ance. At night however a mob of about two hundred people 
collected together and went up to the Governor's house to 
ask his leave to pull down the play-house. Upon their 
approach towards his house, the family were thrown into 
great consternation, upon the idea that they were of the 
other party, and were coming to insult him. He received, 
however, a deputation from them and, as it is said, authorised them to proceed upon their riotous design. They 
accordingly went and began to destroy the fences round the 
house, but were soon dispersed by a Justice of the Peace of 
the other party, who went among them with the riot act in 
his pocket, ready to read it to them if there had been occasion. There has been since then no further attempt to act 
more plays, and all the actors are now gone. 
</p><p>

But the Governor and his instruments were not content with this victory. They must appeal to the public for 
approbation of all his conduct on the occasion and for censure upon that of the opposers to the law ; and Sullivan 
with the intrepidity of face peculiar to himself came forward in last Thursday's paper, under the signature of a Friend 
to Peace, with the professed design to criminate the breakers of the statute and to justify the executive authority. You 
will probably see in the two next Centinels a couple of pieces signed Menander in answer to him. I presume he will reply 
but I think the discussion must terminate unfavorably to him. The subject cannot be very interesting to you, but 
perhaps an interest in the success of the writer may induce 
you to peruse the discussion. I will send you the publication of the Friend to Peace by the next post, and as you will 
receive the Centinel regularly you will there find the answers 
of Menander. 
</p><p>
The unanimity of the electors in this State was by all 
accounts a sore mortification to his State majesty. It 
angered him to the heart and he vented his peevishness 
upon the first objects that presented themselves to him. 
It was on the same day with the election that he made his 
attack upon the players. He made several difficulties about 
signing the warrant upon the treasury for the pay of the 
electors, and delayed until a third message from them was 
accompanied with an intimation to him that unless he 
signed the warrant immediately, they should go to their 
homes without receiving their pay at all. This implied 
menace had its effect, and he signed the warrant. But he 
has affected to be much alarmed for his own safety, and to be 
in terror lest a mob should attack his person or his house. 
There have been in the public prints several foolish inflammatory squibs threatening him with tar and feathers or with 
breaking his windows ; but they have been treated with 
general contempt, and there has not been the slightest 
symptom of any popular excesses against him, though he 
has endeavored to excite them in support of his whimsical 
passion against the theatre. 
</p><p>
A French and English newspaper has been commenced 
in this town which is to contain among other things a sum 
mary account of the French Revolution. This account is 
very handsomely written by one of the Aristocratic party 
now here, having been driven from the Island of St. Domingo 
by the triumphant faction there. He has aimed at impartiality as much as he could ; but if you read the narrative 
you will find he is very bitter against the Duke of Orleans 
to whom he attributes all the calamities of his country. 
The first number only has been published, and the editor 
has forwarded one of them to you which he will continue 
to do. The translation of that part of the paper will be 
done by me, and I imagine the paper itself will not be continued long after that publication is finished. The proposals are only for six months. 
</p><p>
I hope you will not consider me as trifling with my time for spending it in translating French politics and discussing 
theatrical questions. My pen has lain dormant for nearly a 
year and a half, and perhaps its revival may with some 
propriety be by essays upon subjects not of the first magnitude. There has been upon my mind a strong sentiment 
of delicacy which has kept me silent in the midst of all the scurrility of which you have been the object. The charges 
which private malice and public faction have employed as 
instruments against you, have been so despicable in them 
selves, that common sense and common honesty must have 
felt some degradation in descending to the refutation of 
them. I have thought that where they could have any 
possible effect, sober reason and plain truth could not 
counteract it, because the minds affected must be too blind 
or too wicked to feel the operation of just sentiments. 
The event of the election as far as we know it has corroborated 
my opinion. As to the general measures of the federal 
government, when I have seen them attacked artfully and 
insidiously, as has frequently been the case, I have often 
thought of defending them, but as often have concluded 
that my assistance could not be necessary and could be but 
feeble. The government I supposed needed it not, and as 
to my own advancement I could really see nothing in public 
life but what it was my object to avoid. I have been really 
apprehensive of becoming politically known, before I could 
establish a professional reputation. I knew that my independence and consequently my happiness in life depended 
upon this, and I have sincerely wished rather to remain in the shade than to appear as a politician without any character as a lawyer. These sentiments have still great weigh 
in my mind, and if therefore you should think me squandering my attention upon subjects of too trivial import, I hope 
you will do me the justice to believe that it is not for want of judgment in my comparative estimation of things. . . . 
</p><p>
. . . The submission of the minority to the will of the majority, 
he supposes to be the essence of a free government ; and the will of 
the majority he thinks is only to be collected from the suffrages 
of the constitutional legislature: Or if that legislature should 
themselves overstep the constitutional bounds, a case which, he 
admits, may happen, he points to the remedy provided, by a recurrence to the Supreme Judicial Court. But his principle in the 
full latitude to which he extends it is not true; and, if it were, 
it does not prove the position in support of which it is advanced. 
In a free government the minority never can be under an obligation 
to sacrifice their rights to the will of the majority, however ex 
pressed. The constitution of this State is expressly paramount 
to the laws of the legislature, and every individual in the community has the same right with the legislature to put his own honest construction upon every clause contained in the constitution. Every individual ought to regulate his conduct upon such occasions by his own 
construction, and if that construction militates with that of the legislature, he has an indisputable right to violate their laws predicated 
upon their construction. If this be true the conduct of those citizens 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, who from a cold and deliberate opinion that the law 
prohibiting theatrical entertainments is unconstitutional, have 
attended the exhibitions in Board-Alley, is not unjustifiable. For 
as to the violent measures which the Friend to Peace mentions as 
having been resorted to, they have all been on the part of the government. That the law was openly violated is true, and 
from the nature of the case it could not be otherwise. But if disobedience was justifiable at all, the publickness of that disobedience could not make it unjustifiable. So far have the friends 
to the theatre been from deserving the charge of resorting to 
violent measures, that they even avoided resistance against 
the violent measures which were adopted against them, and by 
an example of moderation very honorable to them, preferred to 
make the sacrifice of their pleasures, and rather than contend with 
the strength of that law, the justice of which they could not acknowledge. 
</p><p>
But the Friend to Peace mentions to them another remedy, by 
recommending a trial before the Supreme Judicial Court. And 
is this recommendation made in order to prove their conduct 
unjustifiable in violating the law? Does it not rather prove the 
absurdity of his own censures upon the public manner in which the 
law has been violated? At one moment he cries out "Where are 
the champions for the unconstitutionality of the law?" And 
at another he charges them with resorting to violent measures, 
merely because they come forward too boldly, and challenge its 
penalties by an open violation. He acknowledges that the only 
determination of the constitutional question must be, by a Jury 
under the direction of the Judges, and yet he denominates violent 
measures the action without which that determination cannot be 
had. The proposal that any individual who has broken the law 
should consent to have an information filed against him, is some 
what singular. A writer who talks so much about free governments, methinks should have been more cautious in proposing 
such an expedient to men who complain of a deprivation off constitutional rights. In order to prove that they have acted unjustifiably by the breach of a law, he tells them they ought to assume to 
themselves the duties of the Attorney General, to accuse them selves ; that they ought to consent to a mode of proceeding which 
in his own opinion is dangerous in any government, when that mode of proceeding is pursued directly against themselves. The 
friends of the Drama, Sir, are under no obligation, civil, political or moral, to court the animadversion of the law. When Mr. Hampden in the time of Charles the first, refused to pay the ship money, he did not go to the star chamber, and complain of his own 
refusals. A tax of twenty shillings was assessed upon him, which he held to be illegal. The twelve Judges of England had already 
delivered their opinions that the tax was legal. Mr. Hampden refused to pay it. His violation of what the Judges had declared 
to be law was open and public, but he did not solicit the prosecution which he sustained. The cases appear to me to be nearly 
parallel. The friends of the theatre in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> have publicly 
contravened an act of the legislature, which they do not consider 
as the law of the land ; they have not eluded the regular and constitutional discussion of the point; they have not betrayed a 
consciousness of doing wrong, by shrouding themselves in secrecy; 
they have not fled from the vengeance of the government which they 
have provoked ; they have not shrunk from beneath the gigantic 
arm, which has been raised in "attitude to smite" against them; 
but an invitation to become necessary to a prosecution against 
themselves; a request that they would call the thunders of the 
government down upon their own heads, may excite their derision, 
but will not probably influence their conduct. 
</p><p>
The observation relative to the dangerous tendency of an 
open disregard to established laws is just, but in its application 
to the present subject, it begs the question in dispute, for no obedience is due to an unconstitutional act of the legislature. And 
this is known full well to the chief magistrate, whose champion 
the Friend to Peace professes to be. For if sophistry itself can 
ever pick a constitutional question from a law of the United States, 
he seems disposed to be not merely public, but ostentatious in 
professing disobedience. As to the cases put by way of illustration, of the people of Medford undertaking to work on Sunday ; 
I confess I cannot see its connection with this subject; and I 
do the justice to the logical talents of the Friend to Peace to 
believe, that it was introduced rather for the sake of glancing at the excise on still-heads, than to give any additional weight to his argument. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself I have now shown that the conduct of the opposers to the prohibitory theatrical statute has not been proved 
to be unjustifiable by the Friend to Peace. On the contrary, I 
now Contend that their complete justification will flow from his 
own principles. Considering the law as unconstitutional, they 
have sought as far as could reasonably be required of them, all 
the remedies which their censurer points out to them. They have 
not been guilty of that wanton, unnecessary violation of the established law, which he charges them with. They did not act in opposition to the statute, until they had sought in vain for relief from 
the Legislature nor until the Legislature added to the mortification 
of rejecting their request by the insulting silence of a triumphant 
majority. When they found that a sullen denial of satisfaction 
was the only answer which the Legislature vouchsafed to make to 
their complaint, they proceeded to the other remedy mentioned 
by the Friend to Peace. They acted in open opposition to the 
statute, and if they had not Hibernian blood enough in their 
veins to turn States witnesses against themselves, they had enough 
of American spirit about them not to avoid by any subterfuge a 
legal investigation. The question of constitutionality they have 
always been ready to meet, and in the meantime, they have 
regulated their conduct by their own sincere opinion upon the 
subject.
