You may remember, that when we were travelling together 
in Holland you remarked, that the trackschuyt in one of 
the stages went slower than usual, and inquired of the boatman, what might be the reason ; who answered, that it had 
been a dry season, and the water in the canal was low. On 
being again asked if it was so low as that the boat touched 
the muddy bottom; he said, no, not so low as that, but so 
low as to make it harder for the horse to draw the boat. We 
neither of us at first could conceive that if there was water 
enough for the boat to swim clear of the bottom, its being 
deeper would make any difference ; but as the man affirmed 
it seriously as a thing well known among them; and as the 
punctuality required in their stages, was likely to make 
such difference, if any there were, more readily observed by 
them, than by other watermen who did not pass so regularly 
and constantly backwards and forwards in the same track; 
I began to apprehend there might be something in it, and attempted to account for it from this consideration, that the 
boat in proceeding along the canal, must in every boat's 
length of her course, move out of her way a body of water, equal in bulk to the room her bottom took up in the water ; 
that the water so moved, must pass on each side of her and 
under her bottom to get behind her; that if the passage 
under her bottom was straitened by the shallows, more of 
that water must pass by her sides, and with a swifter motion, 
which would retard her, as moving the contrary way; or 
that the water becoming lower behind the boat than before, 
she was pressed back by the weight of its difference in height, 
and her motion retarded by having that weight constantly 
to overcome. But as it is often lost time to attempt accounting for uncertain facts, I determined to make an experiment 
of this, when I should have convenient time and opportunity. 
</p><p>
After our return to England, as often as I happened to be 
on the Thames, I inquired of our watermen whether they 
were sensible of any difference in rowing over shallow or 
deep water. I found them all agreeing in the fact, that there 
was a very great difference, but they differed widely in expressing the quantity of the difference; some supposing it 
was equal to a mile in six, others to a mile in three, &c. 
As I did not recollect to have met with any mention of this 
matter in our philosophical books, and conceiving that if 
the difference should really be great, it might be an object 
of consideration in the many projects now on foot for digging 
new navigable canals in this island, I lately put my design of 
making the experiment in execution, in the following manner. 
</p><p>
I provided a trough of plained boards fourteen feet long, 
six inches wide and six inches deep, in the clear, filled with 
water within half an inch of the edge, to represent a canal. 
I had a loose board of nearly the same length and breadth,, 
that being put into the water might be sunk to any depth, 
and fixed by little wedges where I would chuse to have it stay, in order to make different depths of water, leaving the 
surface at the same height with regard to the sides of the 
trough. I had a little boat in form of a lighter or boat of 
burthen, six inches long, two inches and a quarter wide, 
and one inch and a quarter deep. When swimming, it drew 
one inch water. To give motion to the boat, I fixed one end 
of a long silk thread to its bow, just even with the water's 
edge, the other end passed over a well made brass pully, of 
about an inch diameter, turning freely on a small axis; and 
a shilling was the weight. Then placing the boat at one end 
of the trough, the weight would draw it through the water 
to the other. 
</p><p>
Not having a watch that shows seconds, in order to measure 
the time taken up by the boat in passing from end to end, I 
counted as fast as I could count to ten repeatedly, keeping 
an account of the number of tens on my fingers. And as 
much as possible to correct any little inequalities in my counting, I repeated the experiment a number of times at each 
depth of water, that I might take the medium. And the 
following are the results.

I made many other experiments, but the above are those 
in which I was most exact; and they serve sufficiently to 
show that the difference is considerable. Between the 
deepest and shallowest it appears to be somewhat more than 
one fifth. So that supposing large canals and boats and 
depths of water to bear the same proportions, and that four 
men or horses would draw a boat in deep water four leagues 
in four hours, it would require five to draw the same boat 
in the same time as far in shallow water; or four would 
require five hours. 
</p><p>
Whether this difference is of consequence enough to justify 
a greater expence in deepening canals, is a matter of calculation, which our ingenious engineers in that way will readily 
</p><p>
determine.
