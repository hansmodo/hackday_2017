I am now seated, pen in hand, my sweet niece, to write you, though not in the humor for the success I desire in producing 
an amusing letter such as mine should be in answer to yours. 
</p><p>
Imagine, if you can, a greater trial to the patience of us farmers than the destruction of a radiant patch of green peas by 
frost ! It came last night on the skirts of a storm ; and while I was lamenting that 
our dear midshipman, Walter, should ever be exposed to such winds, my young adventurers at home were completely wrecked 
off their moorings ! But away with complaints, other patches equally radiant will 
arise, and I will mourn no longer over a mess of peas or pottage, but would rather 
meet you somewhere, or hear about your last party. I had, indeed, my "quantum stifficit" of gayety in Richmond, but what 
I enjoyed most was the quiet but thorough hospitality of the inhabitants among whom 
I should like to spend my winters. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, if my old friends were still there, 
would no doubt be my preference ; but I confess I do not admire contention in any 
form, either political or civil. In my quiet retreat I like to hear of what is going on, 
and therefore hope, my dear, you will not be timid in telling me, though your state 
ments shall be seen by no one else. I wish that circumstances would have permitted 
you to have accepted Mr. V. B. s invitation, but I cannot doubt you had a good 
reason for declining. By the bye, do you ever get hold of a clever novel, new or old, 
that you could send me ? I bought Cooper's last, but did not care for it, because the story was so full of horrors. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dearest Dolly, think of me as your own friend as well as aunt, and write as often as you can to 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
