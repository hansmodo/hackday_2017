UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER,

Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
On the whole I am not sorry that your mission failed, 
since the French are leaving; my sympathies are rather 
with Maximilian. The usual factions of Ortega and 
Juarez will divide the native population, while Maximilian can have the support of the clergy and property. 
They are a miserable set, and we ought to keep away 
from them. Here political strife is hushed, and the 
South have two months more in which to accept the 
constitutional amendment. 1 What folly they exhibit! 
To me Johnson and the old encrusted politicians who 
view everything in the light of thirty years ago seem 
like blind guides. After the 4th of March they will 
rally to the amendment, and it will then be too late. . . . 
</p><p>
Very truly yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jos" rel="me">John Sherman</a>.
