Dear Sir
</p><p>

It is with pleasure that I seat myself to pen you a few lines
to let you know that I
am still in old Tennessee
and living and in good health
and spirits. I have nothing of
importance to wright just now
no more than we are still
working at the fort at this
place there are no sighns
of a battle here soon but
it is hard to tell what
a day might bring forth but let them know we are ready
for them. I believe that if
the army of the potomac
would do what is right we
would have closed up this
fuss before now.
</p><p>
   Another thing is the Copperhea[ ds]
of the north witch I hear
are trying to raise a mass
well just let them keep on
a little longer and they
will see where they will
come out. Woe to them when
the soldiers gets home.
</p><p>
    the soldjiers of the Cumber[ (land]
are more united than ever
they were and we are the
boys that fear no [unclear: noir] that
Southern Shiverly can
bring against us.
The weather is fine here
at present everything looks
like midsumer wether is
very warm at present but
nights cool.
</p><p>
    I will now bring my
letter to a close with the
hope that these few broken
lines may find you and
wife as it leaves me in
good health
</p><p>
no more at present but remain your friend
</p><p>
