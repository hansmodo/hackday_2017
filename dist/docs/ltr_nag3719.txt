Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency on the 5th, from near 
Camden, by Captain O'Hara. On the 10th, that place 
was evacuated by the enemy. They left it with 
great precipitation, after burning the greater part of 
their baggage, and stores belonging to the inhabitants. 
They also burnt the jail, mill, and several other houses, 
and left the town little better than a heap of rubbish. They left all our men, wounded on the 25th, 
amounting to thirty-one, and fifty-eight of their own, 
and three officers, who were all too badly wounded to 
be moved. It is confidently asserted, by several people 
of the place, that the enemy suffered, in the late action, not less, in killed and wounded, than three hundred men. 
</p><p>
Upon the enemy's evacuation, we immediately took 
possession of the place, and the works are levelling, 
a plan of which is herewith inclosed. Had the Virginia militia arrived in time, the garrison would have 
fallen into our hands, as they would have enabled us 
to have invested it on all sides, and the garrison had 
neither provision nor stores to hold out a siege, the 
detachments below, operating under <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a> 
and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, having cut olT their supplies, particularly the article of salt, of which the garrison was entirely destitute. 
</p><p>
On the 9th, the army marched for this place. On 
the 11th, the post of Orangeburg, commanded by a Colonel, and consisting of upwards of eighty men and 
several officers, part British, surrendered to General Sumpter, who, by his address, so intimidated the garrison, in the disposition of his artillery and troops, as 
to produce a surrender of a very strong post, -without 
loss of time or men. Great quantities of provision, 
and some other stores, were found at this. 
</p><p>
On the 12th, Fort Mott surrendered to <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>. The garrison consisted of upwards of one 
hundred and forty men, one hundred and twenty of 
whom were British and Hessian, and seven or eight, 
officers. The place was invested on the 8th, and the 
approaches carried to the foot of the ahatis before it 
surrendered. The redoubt was exceedingly strong, and 
commanded by Lieutenant Macpherson, a very gallant 
officer. Great credit is due to <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>, and 
the few militia that continued with him in the reduction of this post. Lieutenant-Colonel Lee's legion, and 
the detachments serving with him under Major Eaton, 
Captains Finley, of the artillery, and Oldham and 
Smith, of the infantry, were indefatigable in prosecuting the siege. There were taken at the fort, one 
carronade, about one hundred and forty stand of arms, 
a quantity of salt, provisions, and other stores, returns 
of which shall be forwarded hereafter. 
</p><p>
When vQ began our march towards Camden, from 
Deep River, I wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague met'>General Pickens</a> to endeavour 
to collect a body of the militia to lay siege to <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> and Ninety Six ; and both places are now invested. As soon as the Virginia militia join us, I am 
in hopes to be able to make such detachments from 
this army as will effect their reduction. The fort at 
Friday's Ferry will be invested by to-morrow morning. Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, with his legion, and 
some of the detachment serving under him, marched 
for this purpose last evening. The army marches for that place this morning. 
</p><p>
The last intelligence I had from Lord Rawdon, he 
was near Nelson's Ferry, where the enemy have a 
post, the stores at which were moving for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
which indicates an evacuation. Generals Sumpter and Marion are watching their motions. If proper exertions were made to support the southern war, the 
enemy would soon he convinced that, if they divide 
their force, they will fall by detachments, and, if they operate collectively, they cannot command the country. Captain Pierce, one of my Aids, who is out 
watching the motions of Lord Cornwallis, informs me 
that he is on his march towards <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, from Duplin 
Court-House. Should he push his operations in that 
quarter, I shall leave the army here, under the command of General Huger, to effect the reduction of the 
remaining posts, and join the troops collecting to the 
northward. Inclosed I send your Excellency copies 
of several letters found among the papers of Lieutenant Macpherson. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,
