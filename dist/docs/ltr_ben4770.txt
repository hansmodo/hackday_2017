DEAR FRIEND,

Having this Opportunity by M. Le Roy, I embrace it to thank you most heartily for the many Civilities & Marks of 
Friendship I received from you & Mad. Dalibard, while in Paris; & to express my sincere & cordial Wishes for your 
Health & Prosperity : in which I am joined by my Friend Sir John Pringle. 
</p><p>
As I cannot soon again enjoy the Happiness of being personally in your Company, permit my Shadow to pay my 
Respects to you. J Tis from a Plate my Son caus'd to be engrav'd some Years since. With the greatest Esteem & 
Respect, I have the honour to be, Dear Sir,
