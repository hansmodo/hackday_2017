MY DEAR BROTHER : 
</p><p>
I received the copies of your oration by Mr. Atkinson, for which I give you my own and the thanks of my friends. Unwilling to trust my own partial judgment upon the performance, 
I have endeavored to collect the opinions of my friends here, who are most remarkable for their taste, and my own ideas have 
been justified by the universal applause which has been bestowed upon your oration. I cannot but admire the prudence which you have observed in steering so cautiously between the Scylla and 
Charybdis of public opinion, and surely it was your duty to offend no one in a performance of this kind. In a late letter you observe that some of my friends think me too strenuous upon the wrong side. I 
must be thought so, if I deny a single democratic principle. Every man who now ventures to disapprove of a single measure of the French, is according to modern language an aristocrat, and I had 
rather submit to the imputation, than indiscriminately to approve of every transaction of that nation. God forbid that I should ever become the advocate of tyranny, whether exercised by a single or 
a many headed monster. How strenuous are the party in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to engage us in a war ! What abuse and reviling constantly fills that mint of defamation, the National Gazette! How 
determined should be the conduct of the executive ! Surely the conduct of a foreign minister is reprehensible who talks of appealing to the people from the decision of the first magistrate. If 
ever there was a time when firmness was required, it is now. What do you think of the decision of Judge Peters in your part of the world? I would ask one question. Suppose a French ship should 
come up to the wharves of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and carry away to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> twenty or thirty British merchantmen. Could our Court 
of Admiralty have jurisdiction of it? We have had a case similar to that of the ship William, before our District Court. It was argued on the part of the libellants last week, and more ingenious 
and curious argument I never heard in a court. Messrs. Troup and Harison showed themselves to the greatest advantage. To be sure the concluding quotation of Mr. H., applied to Judge Duane, could 
not but raise a smile on the countenance of those who know his character. He is suspected of leaning toward the opinion of 
Judge Peters, for whom he has a great veneration ; but I am inclined to believe that after the argument, and the application of the verse from Horace, " Justum et tenacem," etc., he will not have 
obstinacy enough to decide similarly. We daily expect a French fleet in this port. I dread the moment. We have many turbulent people in this city, who would wish to take advantage of such an 
event. We have already been witnesses to the commencement of very tumultuous proceedings. A writer in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
papers, Pacificus, has claimed the attention of the public. I am happy to find most men of character accord with the sentiments of this writer. Who he is, I know not. The Secretary of the Treasury, 
amongst us, has the credit of being the author. The pieces would not disgrace his pen. Entre nous, it seems to me rather surprising 
that the Vice President has not been called to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. Surely his council is necessary in the present circumstances of this country. 
Pray explain to me. You may have a better opportunity of knowing the reasons than myself or the multitudes who ask me the question. My respects and love to all friends. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
