<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city origin'>CHARLESTON</a>, S. C., <a rel='month origin' value='11'>November</a> <a rel='day origin' value='8'>8</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1860' rel="origin">1860</a>. Yesterday on the train, just before we reached Fernandina, a 
woman called out : " That settles the hash. Tanny touched me on the shoulder and said: " <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> elected." 
"How do you know? " " The man over there has a telegram."

The excitement was very great. Everybody was talking at the same time. One, a little more moved than the 
others, stood up and said despondently : The die is cast ; no more vain regrets ; sad forebodings are useless ; the 
stake is life or death." " Did you ever! " was the prevailing exclamation, and some one cried out: " Now that the 
black radical Republicans have the power I suppose they will Brown us all. No doubt of it.

I have always kept a journal after a fashion of my own, with dates and a line of poetry or prose, mere quotations, which I understood and no one else, and I have kept letters and extracts from the papers. From to-day forward 
I will tell the story in my own way. I now wish I had a chronicle of the two delightful and eventful years that have 
just passed. Those delights have fled and one's breath is taken away to think what events have since crowded in.

At Fernandina I saw young men running up a Palmetto 
flag, and shouting a little prematurely, " South Carolina has seceded! " I was overjoyed to find Florida so

Carolinian as Moses and Lazarus are Jewish.

From my window I can hear a grand and mighty flow of eloquence. Bartow and a delegation from Savannah are having a supper given to them in the dining-room below. The noise of the speaking and cheering is pretty 
hard on a tired traveler. Suddenly I found myself listening with pleasure. Voice, tone, temper, sentiment, language, all were perfect. I sent Tanny to see who it was 
that spoke. He came back saying, " Mr. Alfred Huger, the old postmaster. He may not have been the wisest or 
wittiest man there, but he certainly made the best after-supper speech.
