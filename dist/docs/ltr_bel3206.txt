MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was, a few days since, honored with your Excellency's favor of the 26th of October last, by Lieutenant-Colonel Ternant. I am too fully convinced of the 
utility of the new regulations, not to afford him every 
countenance and assistance in my power; and it will 
be my greatest attention to have the troops in this 
department formed on the plan adopted for the order 
and discipline of the army of the United States. 
</p><p>
I hear, but have no official notice of it, that the 
Virginia line are ordered from the main army, to reenforce this department. If this should prove true, 
it will be fortunate indeed for this country, and, I 
think, exceedingly so for the United States and the 
cause in general ; for it is such an attention to the 
safety of this people, that, if ever an idea has been 
formed and nourished among them that they were 
neglected by Congress, it must now be removed; be 
sides the security it will afford to this State and 
Georgia. 
</p><p>
By the last accounts I have received from <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, the enemy seem to be alarmed by the movements of the Spaniards ; and, towards the end of the 
last month, sent off the sixty-eighth regiment to St. 
Augustine, and, some say, another small corps. What 
has been the fate of Mobile and Pensacola, is uncertain; by some accounts, we have reason to believe 
that they are in the hands of the Spaniards. This I 
have from a number of deserters ; and it is since con 
firmed by Mr. Cowen, one of our officers who was lately exchanged and left <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. I think there 
cannot be a doubt but that such a report prevails there but what gave rise to it, I know not. Though 
I have not so full evidence in favor of the report, as 
gives me satisfaction respecting the truth of it, yet 
I have thought it necessary and my duty to give 
your Excellency this hint. 
</p><p>
While I congratulate your Excellency on the success of the arms of the United States, in the department more immediately under your direction, I have 
to lament that so little has been done here, that we 
have nothing for our consolation, but that we have 
not permitted the enemy to run away with us. I 
have the honor to be, with the highest esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
