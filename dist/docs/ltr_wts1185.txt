<p>
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>, Mo., Feb. 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1868">1868</a>. 
</p><p>
To THE PRESIDENT : 
</p><p>
Dear Sir : It is hard for me to conceive you would 
purposely do me an unkindness, unless under the pressure of a sense of public duty, or because you do not 
believe me sincere. 
</p><p>
I was in hopes, since my letter to you of the 31st of 
January, that you had concluded to pass over that purpose of yours, expressed more than once in conversation, 
to organize a new command for me in the East, with 
headquarters in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> ; but a telegram from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> of yesterday says that " the order was issued 
ordering you" (me) "to Atlantic division"; and the 
newspapers of this morning contain the same information, with the addition that I have been nominated as 
"Brevet General." I have telegraphed to my own 
brother in the Senate to oppose my confirmation, on the 
ground that the two higher grades in the army ought 
not to be complicated with brevets, and I trust you will 
conceive my motives aright. If I could see my way clear 
to maintain my family, I should not hesitate a moment 
to resign my present commission and seek some business 
wherein I would be free from those unhappy complications that seem to be closing about me, spite of my 
earnest efforts to avoid them ; but necessity ties my 
hands, and I must submit with the best grace I can, till 
I make other arrangements. 
</p><p>
In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> are already the headquarters of a department, and of the army itself, and it is hard for me 
to see wherein I can render military service there. Any 
staff-officer with the rank of Major could surely fill any 
gap left between those two military offices ; and by being 
placed in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> I shall be universally construed as 
a rival to the General-in-Chief, a position damaging to 
me in the highest degree. Our relations have always 
been most confidential and friendly, and if, unhappily, 
any cloud of difficulty should arise between us, my sense 
of personal dignity and duty would leave me no alternative but resignation. For this I am not yet prepared, 
but I shall proceed to arrange for it as rapidly as possible, that when the time does come (as it surely will if 
this plan is carried into effect), I may act promptly. 
</p><p>
Inasmuch as the order is now issued, I cannot expect 
a full revocation of it, but I beg the privilege of taking 
post at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, or any point you may name within 
the new military division other than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
This privilege is generally granted to all military commanders, and I see no good reasons why I, too, may not 
ask for it ; and this simple concession, involving no public interest, will much soften the blow which, right or 
wrong, I construe as one of the hardest I have sustained 
in a life somewhat checkered with adversity. 
</p><p>
With great respect, yours truly, 
</p><p>
(Signed) <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>, 
</p><p>
Lieutenant-General. 
</p>
