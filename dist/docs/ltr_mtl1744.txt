MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : By the time you receive this note, you will doubtless find the papers 
raving over the large income which we are each said to have. Knowing exactly the amount we 
each will have, which I have already informed you, I was going to say, I have been shocked at 
the fabulous sum set down to each, but I have learned not to be surprised at anything. Of 
course it is gotten up to defeat success. You will now see the necessity for those circulars being 
issued weeks since. I enclose you a scrap from yesterday's Times of C., marked ]STo. 1 ; also No. 
2, today's Times. The sum of $11,000 has been subtracted in twenty-four hours from the same 
paper. If it continues for a few days longer, it will soon be right. It is a secesh paper says 
Congress gave me $25,000 as a present, besides $20,000 of remaining salary. The $25,000 
you know to be utterly false. You can show this note to B. & K., also the scraps sent. Let 
no one see them but themselves, and then burn them. It is all just as I expected that when 
the division took place, a mountain would be made of a mole-hill. And I fear it will succeed 
in injuring the premeditated plans. If the war rages, the Evening News might simply say that 
the sum assigned each was false ; that $75,000 was the sum the administrator, Judge Davis, 
filed his bonds for. But by all means my author ity must not be given. And then the Evening 
News can descant on the $25,000 each, with income of $1,700 each, and Mrs. Lincoln's share, 
she not being able to touch any of her sons portion. My word or testimony must not appear 
in the article; only the paper must speak decidedly. It must be managed very judiciously, and without a day's delay. 
</p><p>
Yours truly,
