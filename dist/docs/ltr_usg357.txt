MY DEAR MR. CRAMER:
</p><p>
I am now for the first time able to fix approximately the time of my
visit to Copenhagen. We shall leave here on Saturday, three weeks from
to-day, or on the following Tuesday. We shall stop at The Hague three
or four days. Jesse leaves for home so as to take the steamer of the
fourth of June from Liverpool. Our party therefore will consist only of
Mrs. Grant with her maid and myself. If your arrangements are made to
be away from Copenhagen at the time mentioned above, I beg that you
will not change your plans. Should you be there, we shall probably
remain over about one week. Should you be away, we shall stop only a
couple of days.
</p><p>
I have not heard directly from Elizabeth for some time; it is probably
my own fault, for Mr. Corbin is very prompt in answering every letter;
but Bucky writes regularly every week from New York, so I hear
indirectly. When you write home give my love to all of them at
Elizabeth.
</p><p>
Very truly yours,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.

<p>
P.S. I go from Copenhagen directly to Stockholm. I am not personally
acquainted with our present Minister there, though I once appointed him
to a South American Mission.
