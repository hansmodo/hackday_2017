Dear General : Your note of yesterday was handed to me last night by <a href="/results.php?tla=hst" rel="colleague met">Captain Turner</a>, of the dragoons. 
</p><p>
In reply to that note, permit me to refer you to the conversation held with you yesterday 
morning at your quarters. I stated to you distinctly that I intended to march upon St. Louis Rey as soon as possible with a part of the force under my command, and that I was very desirous to march on to the Pueblo to co-operate with <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> ; but my 
movements after, to St. Louis Rey, would depend entirely upon the information that I might 
receive as to the movements of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Colonel Fremont</a> and the enemy. It might be necessary for me to stop the pass of San Felipe, or march back to San Diego. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear General, if the object of your note is to advise me to do anything which would enable a large force of the enemy to get into my rear and cut off my communication 
with San Diego, and hazard the safety of the garrison and the ships in the harbor, you will excuse me for saying I cannot follow such advice. 
</p><p>
My purpose still is to march for St. Louis Rey as soon as I can get the dragoons and riflemen mounted, which I hope to do in two days. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="me">R. F. Stockton</a>, <br>
Commander-in-Chief and Governor 
</p><p>
of the Territory of California.
</p><p>
To Brigadier-General S. W. Kearny,

United States Army.
