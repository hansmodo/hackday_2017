DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Mr. Church proposes to embark on board the British 
packet, which is to sail to-morrow. He has offered to take 
my letters, and I suppose he will be the bearer of dispatches 
from Congress. Our passage, though it was not a stormy 
one, was very tedious. Of eight weeks that we were at 
sea, we had at least four of such calm weather as not to 
proceed more than eight or ten leagues a day. As we 
were coming up the river, we met the other packet, which 
was sailing for France. I had only time to write a line 
and inform you of my arrival. I hope she has by this 
time performed a large part of her voyage, and that three 
weeks hence you will receive my letter. I shall remain 
here some days longer than I expected when I left you. 
As it was too late when I arrived here for me to be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> before Commencement, I thought there was less necessity of my being in haste to go. The President has been 
polite to me, even beyond what I could have expected ; he 
has given me an apartment in his house, where I have 
been these ten days. Mr. Jay was so kind before I came 
here to make me the same offer. 
</p><p>
The politicians here wait with great impatience to hear from you. Matters seem to be at a crisis. The British pilot's orders. Form to yourself an idea how I was puzzled to translate English 
sea terms that I did not understand into French sea terms which I knew no better." 
On the French packet met in the harbor at midnight, about to return to Europe, 
was Mrs. Catharine Macaulay. "I fancy she leaves the country with a less exalted idea of our virtues, than she had when she came to it." 
</p><p>
instead of delivering up the posts, have lately sent there a reinforcement of troops. I have heard from merchants here, 
that the fur trade from which we are thus precluded by an open breach of the Treaty of Peace, is worth annually 
50,000 pounds sterling. This may be overrated, but the reluctance the British show to leave the posts is sufficient 
proof that it is an important object. It is supposed that your next letters will give information on the subject, and let us know what is to be depended upon. 
</p><p>
The duties laid on imported goods by many of the States, and the prohibition of all English vessels in Massachusetts, are another subject of much conversation. Merchants, who often adopt the proverb, that charity begins 
at home, endeavor to demonstrate that the country will suffer very much by these regulations. They say that all foreign nations will be discouraged from bringing us any 
goods while they are encumbered with such heavy imposts, and if we go for them ourselves, they will sell them only for money, which we have not. Many of them are still 
very much afraid of Great Britain. They dread a war, and in case she be not able to carry one on, they tremble lest she should shut her ports upon us and stop our trade 
with her West India Islands. They own that those Islands 
cannot subsist without us, but they think we could not 
hold out if we had no market to carry our productions to, 
so long as they could without them. You will easily see 
that this is the reasoning of a merchant who fears present 
losses, and does not consider future advantages. Fortunately the spirit of the people is different, and I doubt not, 
in case Great Britain should persist in her present conduct, 
sufficient firmness will be shown on this side the water. 
The State of Massachusetts have already prohibited all 
British vessels to come in their ports. A frigate appeared since the act was passed, but was not suffered to enter. 
The States have not given to Congress the power of regulating their trade, but it is almost universally considered 
here a necessary measure. The President of Congress is however much against it. He has written you by this 
opportunity, and perhaps he has given you his opinion upon the subject. 
</p><p>
You doubtless know before this, that Mr. Bowdoin was 
elected governor of Massachusetts at the last election, in 
the place of Mr. Hancock, who was chosen Member of 
Congress for the next session. The parties showed some 
rancor and acrimony at the time, but since the election 
everything has subsided, and the present Governor is very 
popular. It is generally supposed here that Mr. Hancock 
will next year be seated in the chair of Congress. I don t 
know however whether he has accepted the appointment. 
</p><p>
Mr. Osgood, Mr. Walter Livingston, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=arl" rel="acquaintance">Mr. Arthur Lee</a> are the Commissioners of the Treasury. Mr. Lee was 
chosen a few days since, and has accepted. The board could not be composed of persons more universally respected. 
</p><p>
Mr. de Marbois, it is said, will in a short time leave America, and Mr. Otto, formerly a secretary to the Chevalier de la Luzerne, is to succeed him. I believe he will 
not regret this country, nor do I think he will be much regretted himself. The Chevalier is supposed to be much 
more friendly to the country, and is much more respected here. Many persons wonder why a Minister is not sent from the Court of France. 
</p><p>
After reading this letter, you will perhaps think I had better be at my studies and give you an account of their 
progress than say so much upon politics. But while I am in this place I hear nothing but politics. When I get home 
I shall trouble my head very little about them. I propose leaving this next Monday the 8th inst., and shall certainly 
be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> by the 2Oth. I am your dutiful Son.
