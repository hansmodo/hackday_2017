Dear <a href="results.php?tla=jpe" rel="spouse">J.P.</a><br>
Hope you won't mind the pencil but my pen is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnyvale%2C_California" rel="tag">Sunnyvale</a> fine place for it! Just answered one letter so might as well wipe the plate clean. Alas have a free evening and feel too lazy to do lots of things I should do as ironing etc.
<p>
Went home yesterday and there was your letter. No, the picture isn't good but you look very much the same.
<p>
I can't understand why you make so much of beauty operators. Sure are plenty of them in the islands I understand. Have talked with several evacuees since I've been working here.
<p>
I quite agree with your stand but don't think you will change the world. It's the same old world anyway. Good or bad it's the bad which makes us appreciate the good in everything. However its nice to know you are fighting for more than just your superior officer.
<p>
Read part of your letter to Hazel and she thinks you sound intelligent - which I said you were - and said she wouldn't mind writing to you herself! Heaven's only knows when she would get around to it though.
<p>
I moved several days after I wrote to you and have been very busy what with one thing and another. Hazel has charge of the telephone girls in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto" rel="tag">Palo Alto</a> so I and a friend of mine have joined the group. We take the messages the wardens phone in. We are on duty one evening a week and must report when the yellow goes on.
<p>
Our apartment is nothing fancy but comfortable and we get along very well together. Hazel used to be extremely serious but has been having a good time in the last few years and we have lots of fun.
<p>
Seems mighty good to get away from home again. All the gals in Sunnyvale are married and there are lots of unmarried gals up here. I don't feel such a confirmed old maid!
<p>
Yes, I'm surprised to hear that I'm the only girl who has as you say, "registered any concern for your well being". Perhaps you don't let them know you are interested enough. You say you don't like to let people know you are interested but that's one thing I've found out as a beauty operator. Everyone is primarily self centered and likes to think the other person is interested in him. If your work isn't so hot but they like you they will come back. Just a thought and maybe I should practice what I preach What do you think?
<p>
'Tis enough of this rambling. Do I hear you say 'Thank heavens' ?
<p>
Thanks for the picture - I don't have any or I'd send you one.
<p>
Yours Sincerely,
<br>
