MY DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 12th ult. came safe to 
hand through the conveyance of Capt. Barber, together with 
the several articles inclosed. The letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> 
speaks of the state of things on the llth of November on the 
other side of the Atlantic as follows: "The lamp of war is 
kindled here, not to be extinguished but by torrents of blood. 
The firing of the Dutch on an Imperial vessel going down the 
Scheld has been followed by the departure of the Imperial Minister from the Hague without taking leave. Troops are in motion on both sides towards the Scheld, but probably nothing 
will be done till the Spring. This Court has been very silent 
as to the part they will act. Yet their late Treaty with Holland, as well as a certainty that Holland would not have proceeded so far without assurance of aid, furnish sufficient ground 
to conclude they will side actively with the Republic. The 
King of Prussia, it is believed, will do the same. He has 
patched up his little disputes with Holland and Dantzic. The 
prospect is, that Holland, France, Prussia, and the Porte, will 
be engaged against the two Imperial Courts. England, I think, 
will remain neutral. Their hostility has attained an incredible 
height. Notwithstanding this, they expect to keep our trade 
and cabotage to themselves by the virtue of their proclamation. 
They have no idea that we can so far act in concert as to establish retaliating measures. Their Irish affairs will puzzle them 
extremely. Should things get into confusion there, perhaps they 
will be more disposed to wish a friendly connection with us. 
The Congress which met on the 25th of October consisted of 
deputies from 8 Counties only. They came to resolutions on 
the reform of Parliament and adjourned to the 20th of January, 
recommending to the other Counties to send deputies then."

I learn from an intelligent person lately from Kentucky, that 
the Convention there produced nothing but a statement of grievances and a claim of redress. The topic of independence was 
not regularly brought forward at all, and scarcely agitated 
without doors. It is supposed that the late extension of the 
tax on patents, which; as it stood before, is on the list of grievances, will turn the scale in favor of that measure.
