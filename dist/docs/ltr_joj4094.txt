My Lord, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the letter you did me the honour 
to write on the 4th September last, and for your obliging 
interposition in behalf of the person alluded to in it. 
</p><p>
Your lordship's conjectures respecting the new principles 
of trade and finance will probably be realized. We hear 
of several circumstances which look and promise well. 
The extent of those principles, and the system of commerce to be reared on them, are subjects, however, on 
which no decided judgment can here be formed, for want 
of information more minute and unquestionable than we at 
present have. 
</p><p>
Various, my lord, are the conjectures of this country respecting the real disposition and intentions of yours on these 
and some other interesting points. While such doubts and 
apprehensions exist, a degree of jealousy will naturally continue to operate against mutual confidence. For my part, 
I sincerely wish to see good-humour prepare the way for 
friendly intercourse, and by degrees incline both countries 
rather to promote than retard each other's welfare. It 
gives me pleasure to reflect that our wishes on this head 
correspond, and that the time may yet come when your 
abilities and liberality will produce all the public benefits 
which may justly he expected from them. Mr. Pitt's 
views, as to America, are yet to be ascertained : I wish 
they may be such as to increase the reputation and affection 
which his father's memory enjoys among us. It strikes me 
that a minister of any nation, much connected with this, 
will always find advantage in possessing the esteem and 
confidence of America. 
</p><p>
To what events this country may in future be instrumental, is indeed uncertain ; but I cannot persuade myself 
that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has created such a nation, in such a country, to remain like dust in the balance of others. We are 
happy, my lord, in the enjoyment of much more interior 
tranquillity than the English newspapers allow, or their 
writers seem to wish us. In free states, there must and 
ought to be a little ferment. When the public mind grows 
languid, and a dead calm, unmarked by the least breeze of 
party takes place, the vigour of a republic soon becomes 
lost in general relaxation. We perhaps are yet too distant 
from that point ; for although our laws and manners now 
give us as much personal security as can elsewhere be 
found, and although the same may in a great, though less 
degree be said of our property, yet our federal government 
has imperfections, which time and more experience will, I 
hope, effectually remedy. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, my lord, with great respect and 
esteem, your lordship's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
