DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
My destination is altered. Instead of going to 
Canada, I am appointed to command at the south 
ward. There has been a great promotion of Brigadier-Generals ; Armstrong, Thompson, Lewis, Moore, 
Stirling, and Howe, are the six. Four are to serve 
under my orders, namely, Armstrong, Lewis, Moore, 
and Howe. As I am the only general officer on the 
Continent, who can speak and think in French, I confess I think it would have been more prudent to have 
sent me to Canada; but I shall obey with alacrity, 
and hope with success. Griffin has resigned, as he 
flatters himself he can do better in the commercial 
line. I have, in his room, appointed one of the sons 
of Lewis Morris, to whom I was under a sort of engagement. Lord Stirling will take the command until 
the arrival of Schuyler. His Lordship is active and 
distinct. 
</p><p>
In my last I gave you my plan of defence for this 
city and environs; but, from want of men, I shall be 
obliged to leave it in a poor condition. A regiment 
of Associators are, I am told, ordered from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I have likewise sent for a battalion from the 
Jerseys ; but, on the other hand, Ward's and Waterbury's regiments will, I suppose, according to their 
laudable custom, leave the place the moment their 
time is expired, which is the 12th of this month. I 
heartily pray that you may give Mr. Howe a hand 
some salute on his leaving <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I am not yet 
informed who is to take the command in Canada. No 
time, I am sure, is to be lost. As I am ordered away immediately, I must consign the affairs of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
to Lord Stirling. He will acquit himself well. I 
have nothing material to trouble you with at present, 
further than to assure you that I am, and ever shall 
be, dear General, 
</p><p>
Yours, most sincerely, 
</p><p>
