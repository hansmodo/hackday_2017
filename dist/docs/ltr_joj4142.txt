Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letters of the 24th and 28th November last, with 
which you favoured me, have remained long unanswered, 
though not forgotten ; my time having, since my arrival, 
been so occupied by public concerns, that I have had no 
leisure to attend to my private affairs or correspondence. 
</p><p>
As to political reformations in Europe or elsewhere, I confess that, considering men as being what they are, I do not 
amuse myself with dreams about an age of reason, prior to 
the millennium, which I believe will come, though I cannot 
tell the precise time when. Until that period arrives, I 
expect there will be wars, and commotions, and tyrants, 
and factions, and demagogues, and that they will do mischief as they may have opportunity. Human knowledge 
and experience will doubtless continue to do good, in proportion to their extent and influence ; but that they will 
ever be able to reduce the passions and prejudices of mankind to such a state of subordination to right reason as 
modern philosophers would persuade us, I do not believe 
one word of. 
</p><p>
I should not think that man wise, who should employ his 
time in endeavouring to contrive a shoe that would fit every 
foot ; and they do not appear to me much more wise, who 
expect to devise a government that would suit every nation. 
I have no objections to men's mending or changing their 
own shoes, but I object to their insisting on my mending or 
changing mine. I am content that little men should be as 
free as big ones, and have and enjoy the same rights ; but 
nothing strikes me as more absurd than projects to stretch 
little men into big ones, or shrink big men into little ones. 
Liberty and reformation may run mad, and madness of any 
kind is no blessing. I nevertheless think, that there may 
be a time for reformation, and a time for change, as well as 
for other things ; all that I contend for is, that they be done 
soberly, by sober and discreet men, and in due manner, 
measure, and proportion. It may be said, that this cannot 
always be the case. It is true, and we can only regret it. 
We must take men and things as they are, and act accordingly ; that is, circumspectly. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes for your health and happiness, 
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
