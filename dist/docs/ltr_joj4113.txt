Sir. 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the ingenious work which you was so obliging as to send me by Mr. Childs. I have read it 
with pleasure and improvement: it casts new light on several interesting questions, and I observe in it a degree 
of perspicuity not always to be found in dissertations on such subjects. 
</p><p>
The connexion between mind and body, and the operations of the former on and through the latter, continue 
involved in great obscurity. Persevering attention and 
inquiry will, probably, produce further information. The 
spiritual and material worlds, if I may use the expression, 
appear to me to be so widely different and opposite, that I 
am often inclined to suspect the existence of others, intermediate, but of a nature distinct from cither. 
</p><p>
It is much to be wished that nothing may occur to prevent your finishing the analysis of the intellectual powers, 
and extending your speculations to man considered as an 
active and moral being, and as he m mber of a political 
society. There is reason to doubt whether this field of 
science has, as yet, received the highest cultivation of which 
it is capable. The republic of letters is under many 
obligations to your country. May those obligations be 
increased. 
I have the honour to be, with sentiments of respect and 
esteem, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
