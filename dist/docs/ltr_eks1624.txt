CASTLE OF PEROTE, 
April 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
... I have been all day preparing muster rolls. I 
miss Meyerbach very much in these matters. My 
company like all the rest in the regiment is in bad 
order. It numbers ninety-six and only seventy-nine 
are present, nearly half of whom are recruits who have 
been drilled but little or none at all. I shall, however, 
make a strong effort to give them some instruction at 
every delay on our route. I mentioned in some one 
of my letters that I belonged to Lieutenant- Colonel 
C. F. Smith s light battalion of four companies. I 
was separated from it before the close of the siege at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>, but on arriving here I was informed that 
I would be ordered to rejoin it immediately, but before 
the order was published I requested through Major 
Kirby to be allowed to remain here till after muster.

Other circumstances I think will delay me a few days 
longer. I have been on a Council of Administration 
today for concurrence in the appointment of a chaplain to our brigade. The Rev. Mr. McCarty of our 
church, formerly from Oswego, receives the appointment. I am not much acquainted with him, but he 
appears to be an excellent man. It will really be refreshing to hear another sermon, which pleasure I 
hope to have on Sunday, though perhaps by that time 
I may be on some far away scout. The rainy season, 
I believe, has commenced, for there has been a heavy 
shower every evening since we arrived, and this morning the lofty summit of the Coffre del Perote was 
covered with snow which had fallen during the night. 
I feel extremely sad and lonesome in this great prison-like castle. Every sound echoes through its vast halls 
and interminable galleries, and although there are so 
many of us in it, it is so capacious that it scarcely 
appears to be occupied. The ordnance command 
here have been busied today in breaking up the Mexican arms found in the castle. Muskets, escopets, and 
rifles have been literally smashed. The gun stocks 
are used for firewood and the barrels and locks 
broken on an anvil. They can be of no use to us and 
it is determined they shall be of none to the enemy. 
Those taken on the battle field were burnt. The iron 
cannons, I am told, are all to be destroyed and the 
brass and copper guns to be taken to the United 
States. What fools the Mexicans are that they don't 
make peace!

May 1. . . . An order has been received from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> directing a forward movement of the 
whole army to commence as soon as the large provision train arrives. By this order it appears that he 
intends to abandon his rear and suffer his communications with the coast to be cut off. The army, there 
fore, is to depend upon the country for supplies which 
will probably be scanty enough however, " For 
ward " is the word; the " Halls of the Montezumas " 
our destination, and I confidently think that we shall 
soon be in possession of the Capital, though I do not 
believe a " peace will be conquered." The guerilla 
system is already in operation. The train which is 
now coming up was attacked a few days since, and 
some killed and wounded on both sides, though the 
Mexicans were repulsed.

May 2. It is Sunday. I attended divine service 
this morning. A table was placed under the porch of 
the commanding officer s quarters, which served as a 
desk. The men were paraded in masses in the court 
yard, the officers standing near the chaplain. After 
reading the service he preached a good sound, though 
unornamented sermon on the necessity of religion; 
it was a continuation of his discourse of last Sunday. 
This is the first Protestant service I have heard since 
I left Syracuse in August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>"><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a></a>"><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>"><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a></a></a>. I am officer of the 
day and my company the castle guard. In the course 
of my duties I have been completely round the work 
in the ditch.

On the west side, in the curtain near the flank wall 
of the south bastion, I observed a huge wooden cross 
mortised into a circular stone pedestal about two feet 
in height. At the junction of the pedestal and cross 
is a stone step a few inches high sufficiently large for 
a man s feet, and at the extremity of the horizontal 
arms of the cross are arrangements for fastening hands. 
The wall behind the cross was thickly marked with 
musket balls for fifty feet in each direction. All round 
the pedestal and upon it were the bleaching bones, 
skulls, arms, legs, and vertebrae, promiscuously 
mingled, of those who had been executed here, and 
left to the worm and buzzard without sepulchre. As 
I gazed upon these remains of poor mortality, I 
thought perhaps they were the relics of those brave 
Texans who were captured at Mier, many of whom 
were executed here. This is probably the place of 
general execution for the castle.
