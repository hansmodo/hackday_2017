Dear <a href="results.php?tla=jpe" rel="spouse">J.P.</a><p>
So much has happened since I last wrote you that I hardly know where to start! I'm on my way to Washington D.C. - left Sunday evening! Didn't know until last Tuesday that I was going for sure - rather when. However I have to report on June 29th, so I couldn't waste much time. I want to get there in time to find a room or something and to visit with <a href="results.php?tla=ltc"  rel="sibling">Lois</a> and <a href="results.php?tla=mrc" rel="kin">Mark</a> a bit before they leave. Mark is leaving on July 1st and Lois on July 7th for New York. He has obtained a scholarship to Cornell in New York for next year. They certainly are lucky to be together although I think Mark would just as soon be in the thick of it in a way.

I'm having a grand trip. First time I've ever been east of Nevada and it is thrilling! Another girl from Sunnyvale is on the train so we have seen quite a bit of each other. I'm waiting for her to get up now to go to breakfast. The porter practically made my birth up with me in it! Was I surprised! Guess he wants to get his work done so he can rest.

Hazel and another friend took me to dinner in the city last Thursday evening. I thought we were going to San Jose and was quite surprised. We went to Monicos - it was very nice but not quite up to some of the raving I've heard done about it. Saturday evening the <a href="results.php?tla=ebk" rel="kin">Knipes</a> had a family barbaque - in my honor - if you please. Seemed quite funny to me. Ofcourse it wasn't anything fancy -  they just decided on Saturday morning and up and had it. Later Aunt Leaurie and Uncle Russell and Mr and Mrs Ladd came in and much to amazement - they all gave me two pieces of luggage! I was pretty well packed but it didn't take long to change.
<p>
I called Dot up before I left but they were leaving the next day for the Russian River so I didn't get to see them. Zack had two weeks vacation so he picked tomatoes one week and earned enough for their vacation.
<p>
Hope you can read this - writing on the train isn't what it's cracked up to be.
<p>
If you answer this you had better mail it to Sunnyvale and they can forward it to me as I don't know what my address wil be. Please write though for all mail is going to be very nice to get I imagine.
<p>
Don't know just what to say so I'll close now and you can ask questions to fill in the gaps. Lot's of pictures were taken of me and as soon as I get some I'll send them along.
<p>
With love as ever,<br>
