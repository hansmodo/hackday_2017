SIR, 
</p><p>
Agreeable to my letter to you from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I came to 
this place, and had an interview with a committee of the 
legislature, in which I urged the several matters contained 
in your instructions. I strongly represented the necessity 
of solid arrangements of finance, and by way of argument, 
pointed out all the defects of the present system. I found 
every man convinced that something was wrong, but few 
that were willing to recognise the mischief when defined, 
and consent to the proper remedy. The quantum of taxes 
already imposed is so great, as to make it useless to impose 
any others to a considerable amount ; a bill has, however, 
passed both houses, payable in specie, bank notes, or your 
notes, for eighteen thousand pounds. 
</p><p>
"It is at present appropriated to your order, but I doubt 
whether some subsequent arrangement will not take place 
for a different appropriation. The commander-in-chief has 
applied for a quantity of forage, which the legislature is devising the means of furnishing, and I fear it will finish by 
diverting the eighteen thousand pounds to that purpose. I 
have, hitherto, been able to prevent this ; but as it is of 
indispensable importance to me to leave this place immediately, to prepare for an examination, for which I have 
pledged myself the ensuing term, which is at hand, it is possible, after I have left it, contrary ideas will prevail. 
Efforts have been made to introduce a species of negotiable 
certificates, which I have strenuously opposed. It has not 
yet taken place, but I am not clear how the matter will 
terminate. Should the bill for the eighteen thousand 
pounds go out, in its present form, I cannot hope that it 
will produce in the treasury above half the sum, such are 
the vices of our present mode of collection. A bill has 
also passed the assembly, for collecting arrearages of taxes, 
payable in specie, bank notes, your notes, old continental 
emissions at one hundred and twenty-eight for one, and a 
species of certificates issued by the state, for the purchase 
of horses. This is now before the senate ; the arrearages 
are very large. 
</p><p>
Both houses have unanimously passed a set of resolutions, to be transmitted to congress and the several states, 
proposing a convention of the states, to enlarge the powers 
of congress, and vest them with funds. I think this a very 
eligible step, though I doubt of the concurrence of the other 
states ; but I am certain without it, they never will be 
brought to co-operate in any reasonable or effectual plan. 
Urge reforms or exertions, and the answer constantly is, 
what avails it for one state to make them, without the consent of the others ? It is in vain to expose the futility of this 
reasoning. It is founded on all those passions which have 
the strongest influence on the human mind. 
</p><p>
The legislature have also appointed, at my instance, a 
committee to devise, in its recess, a more effectual system 
of taxation, and to communicate with me on this subject. 
A good deal will depend on the success of this attempt. 
Convinced of the absurdity of multiplying taxes in the present mode, when in effect the payment is voluntary, and 
the money received exhausted in the collection, I have laboured chiefly to instil the necessity of a change in the 
plan, and though not so rapidly as the exigency of public 
affairs requires, truth seems to be making some progress. 
</p><p>
There is no other appropriation to the use of congress 
than of the eighteen thousand pounds. 
</p><p>
"I shall, as soon as possible, give you a full and just view 
of the situation and temper of this state. This cannot be 
till after my intended examination ; that over, I shall lay 
myself out in every way that can promote your views, and 
the public good. I am informed, you have an appointment 
to make of a commissioner of accounts for this state. Permit me to suggest the expediency of choosing a citizen of 
the state, a man who, to the qualifications requisite for the 
execution of the office, adds an influence in its affairs. I 
need not particularize the reasons for this suggestion. In 
my next I will also take the liberty to mention some characters. I omitted mentioning, that the two houses have 
also passed a bill, authorizing congress to adjust the quotas 
of the states, on equitable principles, agreeable to your recommendation."
