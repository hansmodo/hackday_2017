WE have at last agreed upon a plan for forming a regular army. We have offered twenty dollars and 
a hundred acres of land to every man who will enlist during the war. And a new set of articles of war are 
agreed on. I will send you, if I can, a copy of these resolutions and regulations.

I am at a loss what to write. News we have not. Congress seems to be forgotten by the armies. We 
are most unfaithfully served in the post office, as well as many other offices, civil and military. Unfaithfulness in public stations is deeply criminal. But there 
is no encouragement to be faithful. Neither profit, nor honor, nor applause is acquired by faithfulness. 
But I know by what. There is too much corruption even in this infant age of our republic. Virtue is not in fashion. Vice is not infamous.
