Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
So uncertain has been the fate of letters during the 
course of this war, that I very seldom write one without 
adverting to the possibility and consequences of its miscarriage and publication. This precaution has on a late 
occasion given me much consolation. Two of my letters 
to Mrs. Jay fell into the enemy's hands at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> ; 
they contained nothing that would give me uneasiness if 
published. Prudential considerations of this kind have, 
since my arrival here, restrained me from writing several 
confidential letters to you ; and I should now be equally 
cautious had I not full confidence in the bearer of this, and 
under little apprehension of danger from accidents on the 
road. 
</p><p>
Congress has refused to accept your resignation. Twelve 
States were represented. New-England and Pennsylvania 
against you. The delegates of the latter are new men, and 
not free from the influence of the former. From New York south you have fast friends. Mr. ******' s disposition 
is at least questionable. Delaware w T as unrepresented. 
</p><p>
What is now to be done? You best can answer this 
question. Were I in your situation, I should not hesitate a 
moment to continue in the service. I have the best authority 
to assure you that the commander-in-chief wishes you to 
retain your commission. The propriety of your resignation is now out of question. Those laws of honour which 
might have required it arc satisfied : are you certain they 
do not demand a contrary conduct ? You have talents to 
render you conspicuous in the field ; and address to conciliate the affections of those who may now wish you ill. 
Both these circumstances are of worth to your family, and, 
independent of public considerations, argue forcibly for 
your joining the army. Gather laurels for the sake of your 
country and your children — you can leave them a sufficient 
share of property — leave them also the reputation of being 
descended from an incontestably great man — a man who, 
uninfluenced by the ingratitude of his country, was unremitted in his exertions to promote her happiness. You 
have hitherto been no stranger to these sentiments, and 
therefore I forbear to enlarge. Would it not do you honour 
to inform Congress that, while in their opinion your services ought not to be withheld from your country, neither 
the derangement of your private affairs, the severities you 
have experienced, nor regard to your health already impaired in their service, shall restrain you from devoting 
yourself to the execution of their commands ; but that 
whenever the situation of our affairs may cease to call you 
to the field, you hope they will permit you to retire and 
attend to the duties you owe your family. 
</p><p>
Should this be your resolution, would not the main army 
be your proper object ? there you may be best known, and 
there best acquire military influence. Consider: this campaign will in all human probability be decisive, and the 
last. Can you, therefore, employ six or eight months 
better. 
</p><p>
I will not apologize for the freedom with which I write, 
being persuaded that although our opinions may vary, you 
will consider this letter as some evidence of the sincerity 
with which I am 
</p><p>
Your friend and servant, 
</p><p>
