</p><p>
When I say I hope to be relieved from my present situation in a few days, I wish not to have my motives misunderstood. In my letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=helvoetsluys" rel="city">Helvoetsluys</a> you will find that I came over here not unaware of what my business might 
draw upon myself, and when you advise me to be of good 
cheer and courage, it must be from a consideration of the 
thing in a similar perspective. But I should be a wretched 
servant of my country indeed, if I were capable of shrinking from the performance of a public service, because it may 
be disagreeable or even dangerous. When I am clearly convinced that my duty commands me to act, if the love of ease, 
or the love of life, or the love of fame itself, dear as it is, could 
arrest my hand, or give me a moment's hesitation in the 
choice, I should certainly be fit for no situation of public 
trust whatever. This principle is a moral obligation upon 
every man in office, and I hope not to be considered as destitute of it. " Universal reproach" is indeed "far worse to 
bear than violence"; but I am fully sensible that it must never interfere with the dictates of one's own mind for the regulation of his conduct. 
</p><p>
So much for the principle. But I may go a little further. The struggle against a popular clamor is not without its 
charms in my mind. Nothing great or valuable among men was ever achieved without the counterpoise of strong opposition, and the persecution, that proceeds from opinion 
becomes itself a title to esteem, when the opinion is found to 
have been erroneous. There are, indeed, situations in which 
no service can be rendered, without the assistance and support 
of popularity ; but there are others in which it can be of no 
public advantage, and in that case popular opposition is 
nothing more than a danger to defy, or a difficulty to over 
come. To say that the danger may prove fatal, or the difficulty insuperable, is no more than to say that a soldier 
marching to battle may leave his life upon the field. 
</p><p>
It is not therefore the dread of newspaper scurrility or of 
a burning effigy that is irksome to me at the present moment, 
or that induces a wish to be relieved from the execution of 
the business for which I was ordered hither. It is another 
thing which was equally within my expectation before I 
came from Holland, but which I have found to a greater 
extent than I imagined. It is that all commercial negotiation on the part of this country will be captious and illiberal. 
That nothing will be conceded but to necessity, and every 
thing will be obtained that artifice or cajolery can pilfer, or 
that insolence under all the forms of courtly politeness can 
extort. I have been accustomed all my life to plain dealing 
and candor, and am not sufficiently versed in the art of political swindling to be prepared for negotiating with an Euro 
pean Minister of State. In other words, besides numerous 
other deficiencies of which on this occasion I am strongly 
sensible, I have not the experience which the proper performance of the duty would require. It is not my intention 
to be abusive, or to call things by harder names than they 
deserve ; but my correspondence with the Secretary of 
State will shew to demonstration what sort of negotiators I have found here. 
</p><p>
Lord Grenville is extremely plausible, and has the art of 
simplicity to an eminent degree. If I am not misinformed 
he affects the reputation of having a word upon which dependence may be placed. But I have no reason to believe 
in his candor or his sincerity. Mr. Hammond is an under 
Secretary of State in his office. He is only cunning, and 
though he may thereby successfully practise an imposition, 
he is too easily seen through to obtain the confidence necessary for thorough-paced intrigue. 
</p><p>
Between them both they have partially executed a hopeful project upon me, the only result of which hitherto has been 
to place me in an awkward and ridiculous situation, but 
which might have led me into very improper conduct, and 
such as might even have drawn at least a color of censure 
upon the American government itself. The ultimate object of this manoeuvre has not yet been unfolded, though I 
think I know what it is. It will perhaps never be worth my 
pains to write, or yours to read, a tedious detail of a transaction, insignificant in itself, and to which circumstances 
only may give importance. Should that prove the case, you 
shall have the story at full length. At present I shall only 
say that it suited their purposes to convert me into a minister to this Court, and that they have persevered in this 
intention with such a supple obstinacy, that one of my principal cares has been to disclaim the proffered acknowledgment of a rank to which I have no title, and to avoid every 
act that could make me accessary to an usurpation of character. The determination on my part has been pursued 
with the utmost candor and frankness. On theirs they have neither been ingenuous to avow their design, nor compliant to abandon it. 
</p><p>
But in this singular contest, while they are so liberal of their acknowledgments and I am obliged to persist in declining them, the result of the whole matter is that I am not 
in my proper place. This conclusion, combining with the 
species of negotiation that I should expect from those who 
have already given me such specimens, leads me to the wish 
of having nothing more to do with them, and of being relieved from a situation of personal embarrassment to my 
self, and of little or no probable utility to the public.

Mr. Pinckney is hourly expected to return, and his experience and character, as well as his talents, are much better 
adapted to treat with men to whom action is an ambush 
and thought a strategem, than I am. As to the subject of 
negotiation, you know that the point of the twelfth article 
of the late treaty touches the ark of their navigation system, 
and you may judge from thence what a disposition they will 
have to be liberal on that score. After they have been to the 
very verge of a war with the United States by their endeavors to exclude the Americans from the French islands, 
it is hardly to be supposed that they will readily give us access 
to their own. But at present their own interest so loudly 
calls on them for a relaxation of their navigation laws, that 
they now find themselves obliged to submit to it in a degree, 
and possibly they may be more inclined towards an agreement advantageous to our interests than they have been 
hitherto. Of this however I can say nothing positive not having had any conversation with them from which any inference can be drawn. 
</p><p>
The principle upon which they meant to have carried 
through the 6th of November [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1793">1793</a>] orders, is that a belligerent power is under no obligation to allow any trade between a neutral nation and the other belligerent than the 
customary peace trade. This rule they have endeavored in former wars to establish, and they have not yet abandoned it. I had not long since a conversation with one of 
their eminent professional men on the subject. He endeavored to convince me that the maxim is highly favorable to 
the permanent national interest of the United States. 
"Separate yourselves" said he "from the mere temporary 
consideration of present circumstances. You are a commercial nation, and the only powers with whom you will be 
liable to be engaged in war are those that have possessions in 
the West Indies. There is the part in which you may expect to find them most vulnerable. But if you admit the 
principle that at the moment when you may be involved in 
such a war your antagonist may open to neutral nations, a 
trade which in time of peace he always reserves exclusively 
to himself, you disarm yourselves of the most efficacious 
weapon you have." I told him that the Americans chose 
rather to admit the Law of Nations as it is, than to aim at 
the settlement of principles which might be favorable to their 
particular interest ; and further that they did not wish to sup 
pose a state of war between themselves and any other nation, 
as it was their desire to remain at peace with all the world. 
</p><p>
I am in anxious expectation of the accounts from America since the meeting of Congress. There is every reason to 
apprehend that the session will be a period of political 
warmth, if not of animosity. The direct and formal attack 
upon the President, which has been carried on in the usual 
style, and which is noticed in your letter, was not unexpected 
to me, and I think you must have received very soon after 
the date of yours a letter from me written at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> in 
July or August, containing the opinions I had then formed 
on that head. That the systematic course of abuse pointed 
against him, and which was arranged in Europe before it was 
put in execution in America, is connected with the scheme for 
dividing the American executive, is perhaps nothing more 
than a conjecture on my part ; but I have little doubt, that it 
was merely preparatory for the purpose of bringing forward 
in due time a change of men or of government in our country. 
It is however proper for me on this occasion to observe, 
that I believe there are two different branches of the system, 
which plays with so much efficacy across the Atlantic upon 
the passions and upon the opinions of the American people. 
One of these branches is not hostile to the real interest of 
the United States, or at least it is much less so than the 
other. The attack proceeded from the most unfriendly 
quarter, and if it had the acquiescence of the other, as an 
experiment it had not their approbation ; and if it should 
fail of success, it is not improbable but the trial of honey will 
be substituted for that of vinegar. Excuse this trivial 
image. I can mean nothing ludicrous in speaking upon such 
a subject ; it conveys merely my idea of their intentions, and 
I would not have used it, if I could venture to be more 
explicit.

I am &C.
