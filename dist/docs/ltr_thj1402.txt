Sir,
</p><p>
Among the instructions given to the ministers of the United States for
treating with foreign powers, was one of the 11th of May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1784">1784</a>, relative
to an individual of the name of John Baptist Picquet. It contains an
acknowledgement, on the part of Congress, of his merits and sufferings
by friendly services rendered to great numbers of American seamen
carried prisoners into Lisbon, and refers to us the delivering him
these acknowledgements in honorable terms, and the making him such
gratification, as may indemnify his losses, and properly reward his
zeal. This person is now is <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, and asks whatever return is intended
for him. Being in immediate want of money, he has been furnished with
ten guineas. He expressed, desires of some appointment either for
himself or son at Lisbon, but has been told that none such are in our
gift, and that nothing more could be done for him in that line, than to
mention to Congress that his services will merit their recollection, if
they should make any appointment there analogous to his talents. He says
his expenses in the relief of our prisoners have been upwards of fifty
moidores. Supposing that, as he is poor, a pecuniary gratification will
be most useful to him, we propose, in addition to what he has received,
to give him a hundred and fifty guineas, or perhaps four thousand
livres, and to write a joint letter to him expressing the sense Congress
entertain of his services. We pray you to give us your sentiments on
this subject by return of the first post, as he is waiting here, and we
wish the aid of your counsels therein.
</p><p>
We are to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 3rd, informing
us of your reception at the court of London.
</p><p>
I am, with sentiments of great respect and esteem, Dear Sir,
</p><p>
your friend and servant,
</p><p>
