I thank you my dear father for your kind favour of 
yesterday, and again congratulate you upon the important intelligence from France. It seems to me to 
have been her interest to offer such generous terms to 
America, as to ensure her prompt acceptance, and to 
avoid every thing which might give room for deliberation and delay. If our embassadors in France 
were plenipotentiaries, the ratification comes of course. 
If they were not, I think it is as little politic as generous to refuse an alliance with France in order to 
accept one upon equal terms with Great Britain. 
</p><p>
There is still a prejudice in the minds of many 
people in favour of the latter, which should be wisely 
counteracted, or that power will gain by artful policy 
what she has lost in the field of battle. The intelligence seems to diffuse sincere joy. We only wait 
for leave from Congress to signify that of the army, 
by sounds which will reach the ears of the enemy.

My wife writes that my uncle is at Marseilles ; his 
stay there depends entirely on my aunt. Harry at 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, and wrote letters which I have never 
received. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Savage died at Brompton, three weeks before 
the date of the letter, which is 17th FeV, <a href='/results.php?year=1778' rel="origin">1778</a>.

Lady Will m Campbell had paid my wife a visit. 
What was the end of that unexpected civility, does 
not strike me. 
</p><p>
Your grand-daughter and Mr. Manning's family 
were well, and desired their love. 
</p><p>
It has been my ill fortune to write all my letters for 
some time past in very great haste, and this is the 
case at present, when I would particularly have wished 
to write deliberately. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
P.S. I am desired to request that you will send 
more blank forms of oaths.
