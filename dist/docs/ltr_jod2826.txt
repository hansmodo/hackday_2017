MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
You have more than once, in your letters, I mentioned 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a>, and in one, intimated a desire that I 
should write you something concerning him. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> has Been very constant in his attendance on Congress from the beginning. His conduct has been composed and grave, and, in the opinion of many gentlemen, very reserved. He has not 
assumed any thing, nor affected to take the lead ; 
but has seemed to choose that the Congress should 
pursue their own principles and sentiments, and 
adopt their own plans. Yet he has not been back 
ward ; has been very useful on many occasions, and 
discovered a disposition entirely American. lie does 
not hesitate at our boldest measures, but rather seems 
to think us too irresolute and backward. He thinks 
us at present in an odd state, neither in peace nor 
war, neither dependent nor independent ; but he 
thinks that we shall soon assume a character more de- 
He thinks that we have the power of pre 
serving ourselves ; and that even if we should be 
driven to the disagreeable necessity of assuming a total independency, and set up a separate state, we can 
maintain it. The people of England have thought that the opposition in America, was wholly owing to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> ; and I suppose their scribblers will at 
tribute the temper and proceedings of Congress to j 
him ; but there cannot be a greater mistake. He 
has had but little share, further than to cooperate 
and to assist. He is however a great and good man. 
I wish his colleagues from this city were all like him ; 
particularly one, I whose abilities and virtues, formerly 
trumpeted so much in America, have been found 
wanting. There is a young gentleman from Pennsylvania, whose name is Wilson, whose fortitude, rectitude and abilities too, greatly outshine his master's. 
Mr. Biddle, the Speaker, has been taken off by sickness, Mr. Mifllin is gone to the camp, Mr. Morton is 
ill too, so that this province has suffered by the timidity of two overgrown fortunes. The dread of confiscation or caprice, I know not what, has influenced 
them too much ; yet they were for taking arms, and pretended to be very valiant.

This letter must be secret, my dear ; at least, communicated with great discretion.

Yours,
