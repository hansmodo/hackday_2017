My dear General, 
</p><p>
I request you will receive my affectionate acknowledgments for your kind letters. Every mark of 
friendship I receive from you adds to my happiness, 
as I love you with all the sincerity and warmth of 
my heart; and the sentiment I feel for you goes to 
the very extent of my affections. Inclosed, I send 
you, my dear General, two copies of letters to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, which I also have sent to Congress for 
their information. You will also find copies of the 
strange letters I have received from General Phillips, 
and the answers, which, if he does not behave better, 
will break off our correspondence. 
</p><p>
The leaving of my artillery appears a strange 
whim. But had I waited for it, <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> was lost, 
and Major Galvan, who has exerted himself to the 
utmost, cannot be with us under two days, as he 
could never obtain or seize horses for the artillery 
and ammunition wagons. It is not without trouble 
I have made this rapid march. General Phillips has 
expressed to an officer, on flag, the astonishment he 
felt at our celerity; and when, on the 30th, as he 
was going to give the signal to attack, he reconnoitred our position, Mr. Osburn, who was with him, 
says that he flew into a violent passion, and swore 
vengeance against me and the corps I had brought 
with me. 
</p><p>
I am, however, uneasy, my dear General, and do 
not know what the public will think of our conduct. 
The little dependence we put upon their militia, I 
cannot expose in an official letter. I cannot say that 
no boat, no wagons, no intelligence, not one spy 
could be obtained ; that if once I had been manoeuvring with Phillips, he had every advantage over me ; 
that a defeat would have scattered the militia, lost 
the few arms we have, and knocked down this handful of Continental troops. A great deal of mischief 
had already been done. I did not know but that the 
enemy meant to establish a post. Under these circumstances, I thought it best to fight on none but 
my own grounds, and to defeat the main and most 
valuable object of the enemy. Had I gone on the 
other side, the enemy would have given me the slip, 
and taken <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, leaving nothing to me but the 
reputation of a rash, inexperienced young man. Our 
stores could not be removed. 
</p><p>
No orders from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> have as yet come 
to me. I cannot conceive the reason of his delay in 
answering my letters. In the meanwhile, Phillips is 
my object ; and if, with a thousand men, I can be 
opposed to three thousand in this State, I think I am 
useful to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. In a former letter, he 
tells me his object is to divide the enemy; and having no orders, I must be regulated by his opinion. I 
wish he would call for the Pennsylvanians, and leave 
me here. The enemy are gone down the river. I 
have detached some militia to Hood's, where I mean 
to make a fort. Colonel Innes, with another corps of 
militia, is gone towards <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>. His orders are, in case the enemy land there, to annoy them, 
and in case they mean to establish a post, he is to 
disturb them until I arrive. This position is sixteen 
miles from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, forty-two from <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 
sixty from <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>. I have sent an officer to 
Point Comfort, and established a chain of expresses 
to know if they appear to turn towards the Potomac. 
Should it be the case, <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> will have my 
attention. Having missed <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, Mr. Hunter's 
Works, at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, must be their next object, 
as they are the only support of our operations at the 
southward. 
</p><p>
Your first letters, my dear General, will perhaps 
tell me something more about your coming this way. 
How happy I should be to see you, I hope I need 
not to express. As you are pleased to give me the 
choice, I shall frankly tell my wishes. If you cooperate with the French against the place you know/'' 
I wish to be at head-quarters. If something is cooperated in Virginia, I shall find myself very happily 
situated. For the present, in case my detachment 
remains in this State, I wish not to leave it, as I 
have a separate and active command, though it does 
not promise great glory. But, as you gave me leave 
to do it, I shall in a few days write to you more 
particularly on my private concerns. It is not only 
on account of my own situation, that I wish the 
French fleet may come into the Bay. Should they 
come, even without troops, it is ten to one that they 
will block up Phillips in some of the rivers, and 
then I answer he is ruined. Had I but ships, my 
situation would be the most agreeable in the world. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General. You will make me happy to write me sometimes. With the highest respect, 
and most tender affection, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, yours, 
</p><p>
