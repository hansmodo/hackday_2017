DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I intended sending the foregoing from <a href='/results.php?city=button mould bay' rel='city origin'>Button-Mould Bay</a>, but 
waited for a boat that I had sent to this place for a barrel of 
fresh salmon, which I had designed for you. The late freshets 
have broke the dam, so that none can be caught till it is mended. Mr. Gilliland sent you a few salted ones, very indifferent, 
which we have eaten, expecting to send you some fresh ones. 
</p><p>
Yesterday, at noon, we left <a href='/results.php?city=button mould bay' rel='city origin'>Button-Mould Bay</a>, and arrived 
here last night. Before we passed the Split Rock, we saw two 
sail astern, which we supposed were the Lee and a gondola. 
They have not yet joined us. We are now under way, with a 
fresh southerly breeze, and expect to be at the Isle-aux-Tetes 
before night. I hope soon to have it in my power to send you 
a, very full account of the strength of the enemy by sea and 
land. I hope no time will be lost in forwarding the three galleys. When they have joined us, I am very confident the enemy will not dare attempt crossing the Lake. 
</p><p>
I beg my congratulatory compliments to General St. Clair on 
his promotion. When the enemy drive us back to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
I have some thoughts of going to Congress, and begging leave to 
resign. Do you think they will make me a Major-General? 
</p><p>
Enire nous, I have received a letter from Samuel Chase, Esq., 
in which he mentions your letter to John Adams, Esq., and desires an explanation. I will send it to you when I have time to answer it. 
</p><p>
I am, with every friendly wish, very respectfully, dear General, your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
