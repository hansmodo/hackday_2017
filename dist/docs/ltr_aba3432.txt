MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I cannot begin my letter by thanking you for yours. 
You write so seldom that you do not give me the 
opportunity. Yet I think you would feel disappointed if you did not get a few lines from me. I congratulate you upon your success at Commencement, 
and, as you have acquired a reputation upon entering 
the stage of the world, you will be no less solicitous to preserve and increase it through the whole 
drama. It is said of Hannibal, that he wanted 
nothing to the completion of his martial virtues, but 
that, when he had gained a victory, he should know 
how to use it. It is natural to the human heart, to 
swell with presumption, when conscious of superior 
power ; yet all human excellence is comparative, 
and he, who thinks he knows much to-day, will find 
much more still unattained, provided he is still eager 
in pursuit of knowledge.

Your friends are not anxious that you will be in 
any danger through want of sufficient application, 
bat that a too ardent pursuit of your studies will impair your health, and injure those bodily powers and 
faculties upon which the vigor of the mind depends. 
Moderation in all things is conducive to human happiness, though this is a maxim little heeded by youth, 
whether their pursuits are of a sensual or a more refined and elevated kind.

It is an old adage, that a man at thirty must be 
either a fool or a physician. Though you have not 
arrived at that age, you would do well to trust to the 
advice and experience of those who have. Oar 
bodies are framed of such materials as to require 
constant exercise to keep them in repair, to brace 
the nerves, and give vigor to the animal functions. 
Thus do I give you " line upon line, and precept 
upon precept."

By the time this reaches you, you will have heard 
of the humiliating condition of Holland. History 
does not furnish a more striking instance of abject 
submission and depression, totally and almost unresistingly conquered by a few Prussian troops ; a nation, that formerly withstood the whole power and 
force of Spain, and gave such proofs of bravery and 
prowess as astonished surrounding nations, now humbled to the dust by an imperious and haughty woman, backed by the troops of Prussia, for a mere 
trifling affront ; or rather, this has been the specious 
pretence for all the horrors which are brought upon 
the patriots and friends of liberty in Holland. May 
her name descend with eternal obloquy to future 
ages.

Poor Dumas and family have lived in a state worse 
than death ; since to exist in constant dread of being 
dragged a victim to an enraged mob, who were constantly threatening him and his family with destruction, is worse than death. His friends all forsook 
him, or dared not appear in his behalf. He wrote a 
most afflicting account to your father, and begged 
him to claim protection for him, as acting for the 
United States ; but, as he never had any public 
character, or, rather, never was commissioned by 
Congress, it could not be done. Mr. Dumas, you 
know, has been engaged in the service of France, 
and has received a salary from that government, besides his being opposed to the measures of the Stadtholder ; all of which renders him particularly obnoxious to the Princess and her party.

This nation piqued at the treaty of alliance 
which was last winter made between France and 
Holland, has been ever since seeking revenge, by 
fomenting the troubles in Holland, and seized the 
first opportunity she had in her power, to bully 
France. The death of Vergennes, the deranged 
state of the finances in France, and the dispute 
between the King and his Parliament, all, all have 
contributed to hasten the downfall of liberty in Holland. England has held a very high tone, and given 
it out, that, if France marched a single man to the 
assistance of Holland, it should be considered as a 
commencement of hostilities ; and, from the conduct 
of France, she appears to have been intimidated and 
held in awe by it. This is another lesson to us not 
" to put our trust in princes." England, not content 
with the tame and pacific conduct of France, is arming with a zeal and eagerness really astonishing to 
every person of reflection, who can see no object 
which she can have in view adequate to or a compensation for the horror and distress she must bring upon 
her subjects by the increase of expenses, and the 
accumulation of the national debt.

If I was not present to see and hear it, I could 
scarcely credit that a whole people should not only 
tamely submit to the evils of war, but appear frantic 
with joy at the prospect ; led away by false glory, 
by their passions and their vices, they do not reflect 
upon past calamities nor approaching destruction ; 
and few of them have better reasons to offer for 
their conduct, than the lady with whom I was in 
company the other day, who hoped there would be 
a war. " Pray," said I, " how can you wish so 
much misery to mankind ? ' " O," said she, " if 
there is a war, my brother and several of my friends 
will be promoted." In the general flame, which 
threatens Europe, I hope and pray our own country 
may have wisdom sufficient to keep herself out of 
the fire. I am sure she has been a sufficiently burnt 
child. Remember me to your brothers, if I do not 
write to them.

Your ever affectionate mother,
