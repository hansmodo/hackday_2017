Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your Excellency's letter of 25th 
June last, with a copy of one addressed to you from 
General Parsons, inclosed. Your feelings of distress 
excite a sympathy in my breast, and a readiness to 
do all in my power to remove the occasion. That the Committee from the Connecticut line of the army did 
not accomplish a full settlement, was to me a matter of sorrow, and fear for its consequences. The 
veteran troops who faithfully served, and bravely endured so many distresses in defence of their own and 
their country's righteous cause, in the unhappy contest with the British King and Ministry, and continue therein to the end, will be rewarded, acknowledged, and remembered with love and gratitude by 
this and future generations. Surely, none will forsake 
it, or cause disturbances at This time, when in a near 
view of a happy issue. Those who do, will meet with 
reproach and regret. 
</p><p>
The country, universally, have had many, very many 
embarrassments and great difficulties to encounter and 
struggle through; enemies secret as well as open; 
no permanent army raised ; soldiers to be hired into 
the service for short periods, at extravagantly high 
prices ; no magazines of provisions ; an army to be 
fed from hand to mouth ; finances deranged ; public 
credit abused and ruined ; a rapid depreciation of 
the currency ; the army not paid or clothed ; the force 
and pernicious policy of a cruel and inveterate enemy to be met and avoided ; heavy taxes ; unreasonable jealousies ; with a train of other grievances more 
easily conceived than expressed. Suffer me to mention one more, by way of inquiry; â€” whether it is not 
grievous to hear our officers say, " that they have 
no justice to hope for from the State, unless their 
accounts are closed, and their wages and subsistence 
secured, before the period arrives in which they have 
no further occasion for the services of the army." 
</p><p>
I do sincerely wish for that period, and will then, 
and ever, exert myself to obtain justice for the officers and soldiers of our line, as freely as I have 
done so to bring the war to a happy close. A full 
settlement was agreed on for the pay and wages of 
our line. The subsistence of the officers is the only 
matter unsettled. It was proposed to give them, eightpence half-penny per ration, not from the first of 
April last, as mentioned in the letter, but from the 
first of April, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a> ; the residue to lie open for the 
determination of Congress. 
</p><p>
The Legislature of this State is not sitting. To 
call it to meet at this season, when every other business, public and domestic, calls for the attention of 
the members, will cause discontent and uneasiness. 
You may depend on my giving the subject as early 
a consideration as may be found convenient, and consistent with other circumstances. A sum of money 
for our line of the army, as much as can be collected, 
shall be forwarded soon. I have the honor to be, with 
sentiments of great regard and consideration, &c.,
