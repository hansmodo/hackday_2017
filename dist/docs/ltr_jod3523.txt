MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
YOURS of 15th December was sent me yesterday by 
the Marquis, whose praises are celebrated in all the 
letters from America. You must be content to receive 
a short letter, because I have not time now to write a 
long one. I have lost many of your letters, which 
are invaluable to me, and you have lost a vast number of mine. Barnes, Niles, and many other vessels 
are lost. 
</p><p>
I have received intelligence much more agreeable 
than that of a removal to Holland ; I mean that of 
being reduced to a private citizen, which gives me 
more pleasure than \ ou can imagine. I shall there 
fore soon present before you your own good man. 
Happy happy indeed shall I be, once more to see 
our fireside. I have written before to Mrs. Warren, 
and shall write again now. Dr. J. is transcribing your 
Scotch song, which is a charming one. Oh, my 
leaping heart ! 
</p><p>
I must not write a word to you about politics, be 
cause you are a woman. 
</p><p>
What an offence have I committed ! A woman ! 
</p><p>
I shall soon make it up. I think women better 
than men, in general, and I know, that you can keep a 
secret as well as any man whatever. But the world 
don t know this. Therefore if I were to write my 
sentiments to you, and the letter should be caught 
and hitched into a newspaper, the world would say, I 
was not to be trusted with a secret. 
</p><p>
I never had so much trouble in my life as here, 
and yet I grow fat. The climate and soil agree with 
me. So do the cookery and even the manners of the 
people, of those of them at least that I converse with, 
churlish republican as some of you on your side 
the water call me. The English have got at me in 
their newspapers. They make fine work of me 
fanatic, bigot, perfect cipher, not one word of the 
language, awkward figure, uncouth dress, no address, 
no character, cunning, hard-hearted attorney ; but the 
falsest of it all is, that I am disgusted with the Parisians. Whereas I admire the Parisians prodigiously. 
They are the happiest people in the world, I believe, 
and have the best disposition to make others so. If I 
had your ladyship and our little folks here, and no 
politics to plague me, and a hundred thousand livres 
a year rent, I should be the happiest being on earth. 
</p><p>
Nay, I believe I could make it do with twenty thousand. 
</p><p>
One word of politics. The English reproach the 
French with gasconade, but I don t believe their 
whole history could produce so much of it as the 
English have practised this war. The commissioners proclamation with its sanction from the ministry 
and ratification by both houses, I suppose is hereafter 
to be interpreted like Burgoyne's, " Speaking daggers 
but using none." They cannot send any considerable reinforcement, nor get an ally in Europe. This, 
I think, you may depend upon. Their artifice in 
throwing out such extravagant threats was so gross, 
that I presume it has not imposed on any. Yet a nation that regarded its character never could have 
threatened in that manner. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
