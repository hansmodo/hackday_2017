SIR: 
</p><p>
I have just received yours of the 12th inst. by Major Conyers. I certainly will not give Col. Maham leave to give up the horses you 
mention, and I think it extraordinary he should attempt to release them without my permission. I should imagine he would hardly presume to 
disobey your orders ; but, if you apprehend any danger, I will immediately send you a press warrant, to prevent them from being taken away. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
