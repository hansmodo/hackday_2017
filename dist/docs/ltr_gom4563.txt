My Lord, 
</p><p>
At the close of a conversation with your Grace, and the Right 
Honorable Mr Pitt, on the twenty-first of May last, I was told 
that you would confer together, and transmit a reply to the letter, which I had the honor of addressing to your Grace on the 
thirtieth of April. In expectation of that reply, I have patiently waited in this city to the present hour, though called by 
many affairs to the continent. But my departure cannot be 
much longer delayed, and therefore it becomes necessary to 
intrude once more on your Grace's attention. 
</p><p>
I was led to believe, my Lord, that a friendly connexion 
might have taken place between this country and that of which 
I have the honor to be a citizen. How far it might be useful to Great Britain, I presume not to conjecture ; being perfectly convinced, from the wisdom and extensive information of 
his Majesty's ministers, that the best rule for private judgment 
must be derived from their conduct. But, my Lord, I candidly 
own, that such connexion appears to be of great consequence 
to America ; and therefore the hope of becoming instrumental 
in the accomplishment of it was most pleasing ; nor am I ashamed to avow my concern at the disappointment. 
</p><p>
Your Grace will readily recollect the purport of the letter, which 
you did me the honor to write on the twenty-eighth of April, 
and that mine of the thirtieth entreated a communication of the 
nature and extent of that redress, which his Majesty's ministers 
expected upon the specific points of the treaty of peace, and the 
kind and measure of compensation they would require in case, as 
had been supposed, the specific performance on our part were 
now impracticable. Months having elapsed in silence, your Grace 
will, I hope, pardon me for observing that the pointed avowal of 
a determination to withhold performance, unless upon certain 
conditions, the communication of which is withheld, might be 
construed into unconditional refusal. Your personal integrity 
and honor, my Lord, the acknowledged justice of his Majesty, 
and the pride of British faith, prohibit me from harboring that 
idea. But it may perhaps be entertained by my countrymen, 
and if it should, it may lead to measures, which in their consequences may eventually induce the two nations to seek rather 
the means of reciprocal injury, than of mutual advantage. I 
humbly hope that this may never happen. The sentiment of 
America has long been conciliatory, and I should feel inexpressible satisfaction if your Grace would supply me with the means 
of restoring activity to her friendly dispositions. 
I have the honor to be, &c.
