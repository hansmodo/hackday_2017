DEAR Sm, I make use of the opportunity afforded by the 
return of Col. Hoomes to inclose a parcel of the late newspapers, 
which may contain some things not in the other papers you get. 
You will find in them all the particulars known here concerning 
the affairs of France, and sketches of the business as yet brought 
before Congress. The President's speech and the two answers 
are, I believe, also in the collection. The passages relating to 
the excise are particularly interesting in several respects. The 
answer of the House of Representatives on that subject is thought 
by some of us to have been carried too far. That laws in force 
f should be supported is right, and ought to be asserv.d; but to 
say, first, that a free Government should listen to representations with a disposition to give redress where proper, and then 
to prejudge them by saying that the progress of contentment is as 
obvious as it is rational, does not appear very consistent. And 
as little prudent was it, perhaps, to add, what will be regarded 
as an insinuation, that the opposition to the excise proceeds from 
a selfish and unjust wish to avoid a common share of burden; 
an insinuation not generally true, and more likely to inflame 
than heal the wound. We are anxious for the arrival of Col. 
Taylor. I hear with much pleasure from Col. H. of your good 
health. Wishing a continuance of it and every other blessing, 
I remain, dear sir, your affec te friend.

P. S. I throw in for your amusement an anonymous pamphlet, 
which makes pretty free with the characters of several of your 
friends. In what respects myself, every thing happens to be 
notoriously false which I would wish not to be true.
