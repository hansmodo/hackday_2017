Dear Brother : . . . This morning at breakfast I received a note from Gen. B. F. Butler, asking me to say 
when he could see me. I supposed it was about a son 
of his nephew George and Rose Eytinge, about whom I 
had written him two months ago. After breakfast I 
went to the office and found that he was in Room 1, on 
the ground floor, so I went there. He was alone, and 
asked me to be seated. I commenced to speak of his 
grand-nephew, when he said that was not the reason of 
his call. He then took up the conversation, and said 
that the country was in real danger, revealed by the death 
of the Chief Justice, that there was a purpose clearly 
revealed for the old rebels to capture the Supreme Court, 
as shown by the appointment of Lamar and the equal 
certainty of Waite being succeeded by a Copperhead or 
out and out rebel ; that in the next four years Miller and 
Bradley would create vacancies to be filled in like manner, thus giving the majority in that court to a party 
which fought to destroy the Government, thereby giving 
those we beat in battle the sacred fruits of victory. 
That is a real danger. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
