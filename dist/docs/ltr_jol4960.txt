My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I am very happy in having an opportunity of introducing to your acquaintance, General Forman, a 
gentleman for whom I have the highest esteem, on account of his indefatigability and great sacrifices in the public service. 
</p><p>
You will discover at a first interview that he is a 
man of enlightened understanding, and will receive 
much satisfaction from his account of the most interesting military transactions of the present day. I 
must refer you to this gentleman, likewise for a more 
minute relation of the obstacles which have delayed 
the operations of the French fleet. "We were on board 
of the Admiral together, and he had an opportunity of 
being acquainted with the difficulties with which the 
Admiral has struggled. 
</p><p>
Whatever civilities or services it may be in your power to offer to Gen'l Forman, will give particular pleasure to 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
