MY DEAR,
</p><p>
DR. CHURCH has given me a lotion which has helped my eyes so much that I hope you will hear from me 
oftener than you have done. Pray write me as often and particularly as possible. Send your letters to the 
care of the Committee of Safety, who will forward them. I long to know how you fare, and whether 
you are often discomposed with alarms. Guard yourself against them, my dear. I think you are in no 
danger. Don't let the groundless fears and fruitful imaginations of others affect you. Let me know 
what guards are kept ; and who were principally concerned in the battle I at Grape Island, as well as that at Chelsea. The reputation of our country 
men for valor is very high. I hope they will maintain it, as well as that for prudence, caution, and conduct. 
</p><p>
When I shall come home I know not. We have business enough before us, to detain us until the 31st 
of next December. No assembly ever had a greater number of great objects before them. Provinces, 
Nations, Empires are small things before us. I wish we were good architects.
