ON MY return from the mountains, I found the water too high for mining operations, and we probably shall be unable to do but little before the 1st of June, when the rains are over and the snows melted. And here is one of the drawbacks upon mining. During the winter, no man can work for the rains, and on the streams the water continues so high from melting snows and spring rains that, on Feather River at least, little or nothing can be done till June. In August, the intense heat of the sun drives the miners from the ravines, so that really about four months of the year only can be taken as a maximum for mining on the rivers.

As high as this stream is worked, it is chiefly done by throwing dams across at the head of bars, and the water is turned from its bed through a race, and the bed of the stream is then worked out. I do not know of a single bar for forty miles up from the Valley, that is not claimed by companies who have their races dug and who will put in their dams as soon as the water falls sufficiently. Hitherto, the common rocker has been in general use, but now quicksilver machines are introduced and, by another season, will most probably supersede the old cradle. Little or nothing is lost by these machines, and the results have sometimes been astonishing, even on bars which have been worked over by the old rocker. A new and expeditious mode of building dams has been recently introduced which promises much success. It is simply filling bags with sand and laying them on each other, breaking joints like laying up bricks in a wall. They become compact and shut out the water completely, while an efficient dam can be built in a few hours.

As a general thing, the health of those who remained in the mines during the winter is good, and those who survived the sickness and exposure of last fall are in robust health. Still, whether they will be able to stand the labor and intense heat of summer remains to be seen. Provisions are now obtained in the mines with much less difficulty than they were last fall, and in greater variety, so that the meagre diet of the miners can be replaced by that more healthful. Trading establishments keep pace with the crowds forcing their way into the mountain recesses, and competition is rapidly reducing the exorbitant prices which were common last fall. Still prices are high. Labor in the mines is worth from ten to twelve dollars per day; a single meal, not only in the mountains but in the Valley generally,
is $1.50. New towns are springing up at points convenient to the mines, and speculations in town lots with dubious titles are as rife as they were at home in 1836.

High water preventing any mining operations, I came down to this place a few days ago, where I shall remain until the streams are low enough to work in the mines. In November last, there was but a single adobe house here. Now there is a town with a population of a thousand souls, an active, busy stirring place, at the mouth of the Yuba, with a fleet of whale boats, small schooners, and, during the floods, daily steamboats, discharging cargoes on the levee But for some of the unique California buildings, wood and cloth combined, and the costume and peculiar habits of the citizens, you might well fancy yourself still at home in the "land o' the leal."

One of the peculiar concomitants of a town in Alta California is gambling. The most spacious tents and halls are rather gorgeously fitted up, decorated with pictures, and at one end a splendid bar affords the means of giving courage to the unsophisticated, and enables him to lose in a few moments the hard earnings of months of toil and privations, while around the room rows of tables stand, with piles of money, with various games to "take the stranger in." At some of the tables, Mexican women preside at monte, and they always get a crowd around them. I was taken a little aback yesterday at seeing a young woman perambulating the streets in men's attire. I was told she was married. It is certain she has a marvelous penchant for wearing the breeches, and her husband might as well assume petticoats at once. It is not uncommon to see Mexican women astride of horses, and they ride well too. We do not grow fastidious in such matters, after living among Indians who have worn Adam and Eve's morning dresses all their lives. As brandy, ale, wine, cider, &c., cost only two bits a drink now, any fool can afford to drink, and you would be astonished at the number of such fools among us.

and I was rather more amused than edified last Sunday by hearing a reverend gentleman of the Methodist persuasion holding forth the sublime truths of Sacred Writ from a pile of boards in the public square and preaching the necessity of regeneration. He kept a drinking house in one of the back streets, and could at any time give practical evidence of the power of spirit. After all this strange medley of right and wrong, of what we have been taught to look on as good or bad, the principle of law and order still exists, and crime,
aggression or violent outbreaks are as unusual as in the States; and I do not doubt that, in the course of time, future emigrations, as well as the early habits of those now here, will give tone to society in California, and out of this chaos a different state of things will be produced.

A large yield from the mines is anticipated the present season, and this is justly predicated upon two reasons. There are many more engaged in mining, and the work is carried on more scientifically with the use of quicksilver. You cannot judge of the amount of gold raised here by quotations from arrivals in the United States. Large amounts go to Oregon, the Sandwich Islands, Mexico, South America, Europe, and even China, of which you receive no advices.

That we are advancing in the science of law, especially for the punishment of offenders, you will readily acknowledge from one of the incidents of the day. Last night, one of the gambling houses of this town was slit through with a knife, and some thieves entered and stole a trunk belonging to the proprietor, containing a thousand dollars. This morning, one of the thieves offered a pistol for sale that was in the trunk, which led to his detection and that of an accomplice. A grand jury was summoned, and one of the culprits plead guilty. A true bill was found against both, and a petit jury was impanelled forthwith before the alcalde. The tide of fortune was against the culprits, and they were sentenced each to receive one hundred lashes on the bare back, and, if found in town in the morning, a fine of a thousand dollars and two years' labor in the chain gang of San Francisco. Sentence was immediately executed. They were tied to a tree, their backs laid bare, and a brawny arm soon paid them the penalty of dishonesty, much to the edification of a large throng of bystanders in the public square. One of them appeared penitent and was probably young in crime; the other, when his back was bared, showed indubitable proof of a former acquaintance with the cat and no doubt was an old offender. On their discharge, they disappeared in the crowd and can now go and try their light-fingered propensity in some other community. But a small portion of the money was recovered. As there are no prisons, this is the only way of punishment, and this speedy justice will not be without its effects upon others. Having an opportunity of sending this to Sacramento, I am writing hurriedly.
