General:  I have had the honour to receive your letter of yesterday's
date.  From the reports that reach me that are entitled to credit,
the force of the enemy opposite Fredericksburg is represented as too
large to admit of any diminution whatever of our army in that vicinity
at present, as it might not only invite an attack on Richmond, but
jeopard the safety of the army in the Peninsula.  I regret, therefore,
that your request to have five thousand men sent from that army to
reinforce you cannot be complied with.  Can you not draw enough from
the command of General Edward Johnson to warrant you in attacking
Banks?  The last return received from that army show a present force
of upward of thirty-five hundred, which, it is hoped, has since
increased by recruits and returned furloughs.  As he does not appear
to be pressed, it is suggested that a portion of his force might be
temporarily removed from its present position and made available for
the movement in question.  A decisive and successful blow at Banks's
column would be fraught with the happiest results, and I deeply regret
my inability to send you the reinforcements you ask.  If, however, you
think the combined forces of Generals Ewell and Johnson, with your
own, inadequate for the move, General Ewell might, with the assistance
of General Anderson's army near Fredericksburg, strike at McDowell's
army between that city and Acquia, with much promise of success;
provided you feel sufficiently strong alone to hold Banks in check.
</p><p>
                Very truly yours,
</p><p>
                            <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me"> R. E. Lee</a>.

<i>[Biographer's note:
The reader will observe that this letter bears the date 'April 29,
1862.'  On May 5th or 6th, General Jackson formed a junction between
his own command and that of General Edward Johnson; on May 8th, he
defeated Milroy at McDowell.  Soon thereafter, the command of General
Ewell was united to that already under Jackson, and on the 25th of
the same month Banks was defeated and put to flight.  Other incidents
might be cited to illustrate this branch of the important service
rendered at this period by General Lee.  The line of earthworks around
the city of Richmond, and other preparations for resisting an attack,
testified to the immense care and labour bestowed upon the defense
of the capital, so seriously threatened by the army of General
McClellan.]</i>
