SIR: 
</p><p>
Your favor, with the cattle by Mr. DeLoach came safe, for which I 
am much obliged to you. I am glad to hear you have got your company, 
and are quiet with respect to the out layers, though I would recommend to you to be on your guard, least they should return, at a time 
when you do not expect them, and come on you unawares. As it is deter 
mined to go against the Cherokees, I would be much obliged to you, if 
you can possibly do it, to collect on Edisto twenty-five or thirty good 
beeves and send them up so as to be at the Cherokee ford on <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> 
River, on Monday, the sixteenth inst. I would not put you to this 
trouble, but expect beeves will be scarce. As I do not mean to take the 
men you have engaged to the nation, if any of them should come with 
the cattle, I will send them immediately back. I would recommend to 
you to send spies down Edisto, and if possible find out where Cunning 
ham keeps, and what his intention is, and if possible drive him from 
those parts ; though I would much rather you could destroy him and 
his party. I send you six swords which you will have care taken of, 
and when you have done with them, you will have them returned. 
</p><p>
I have likewise sent you a few sheets of paper to make your returns. 
You have my best wishes, and am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most humble servant, 
</p><p>
