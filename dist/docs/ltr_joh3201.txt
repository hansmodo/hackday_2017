SIR, 
</p><p>
The absolute necessity of cutting off all supplies 
and intelligence from the enemy, in and near the 
city of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and thereby preventing any 
intercourse between them and the disaffected in the 
State of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, has induced 
the Congress to adopt the inclosed resolves, in hopes, 
if possible, to put an effectual stop to a practice so 
extremely dangerous to the cause of America. They 
have, for this end, authorized you to sentence, by 
court-martial, any person convicted of either of the 
above-mentioned offense, or of acting as a guide or pilot, to suffer death, or such other punishment 
as may be thought adequate, provided he is taken 
within thirty miles of any town in Pennsylvania, Jersey, or Delaware, that is in possession of the enemy. 
They have also recommended to the good people of 
this and the other States to be vigilant in apprehending and securing all such persons as may be 
caught in the violation of the inclosed resolves, to 
which I beg leave to refer your attention. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 5th instant was duly received, 
and immediately laid before Congress. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
