Dear Brother : We start forth to-day, camp to-night at 
or near Vienna, to-morrow early we attack the enemy 
at or near Fairfax C.H., Germantown and Centerville, 
thereabouts we will probably be till about Thursday, 
when movement of the whole force, some 35,000 men on 
Manassas, turning the position by a wide circuit. You 
may expect to hear of us about Aquia Creek or Fredericksburg (secret absolute). . . . 
</p><p>
If anything befall me, my pay is drawn to embrace 
June 30, and Ellen has full charge of all other interests. 
Good bye. Your Brother,
