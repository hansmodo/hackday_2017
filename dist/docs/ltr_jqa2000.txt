SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received a volume entitled "Fondemens de la Jurisprudence naturelle, traduit du Latin, de Mr. Pestel, professeur en Droit public a Leyde," which you did me the 
honour to send me as a present. I entreat you, sir, to accept of my sincere thanks for the proof of your attention to me. 
</p><p>
It was very good in you, to turn my young head to such a subject so important in itself, and likely to be particularly so to our Country. I will endeavour to make the best use 
of it I can, as soon as I shall be able to comprehend it. 
</p><p>
Please to present my Respects to your Nephew, and believe me with great Veneration, yours etc. 
</p><p>
