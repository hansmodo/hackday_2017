Dear Brother : It is out of all reason to expect me to 
write much, and I know you do not expect it. Were I to 
attempt narration, it would swell to unreasonable lengths, 
and even in my communication to the War Department 
I must confine myself almost to generalities. Suffice it 
to say that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> and I had a perfect understanding, and all things are now as near our calculations 
as possible, save and except that the Red River failure has 
clipped from the general plan our main feature, a simultaneous attack on Mobile from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>. But the 
Ked River expedition is out, and I have substituted a 
smaller force subject to my own orders, in lieu of the 
larger one contemplated made up by General Banks. 
</p><p>
My long and single line of railroad to my rear, of 
limited capacity, is the delicate point of my game, as also 
the fact that all of Georgia, except the cleared bottoms, 
is densely wooded, with few roads, and at any point an 
enterprising enemy can, in a few hours with axes and 
spades, make .across our path formidable works, whilst 
his sharp-shooters, spies, and scouts, in the guise of peaceable farmers, can hang around us and kill our wagonmen, 
messengers, and couriers. It is a big Indian war ; still 
thus far I have won four strong positions, advanced a 
hundred miles, and am in possession of a large wheatgrowing region and all the iron mines and works of 
Georgia. Johnston's army is still at my front and can 
fight or fall back, as he pleases. The future is uncertain, 
but I will do all that is possible. 
As ever, 
</p><p>
Your brother, 
</p><p>
W. T. SHEBMAN.
