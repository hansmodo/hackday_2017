MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
OUR good friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met friend'>General Lincoln</a>, gave me this 
morning your favor of the 7th, which compensated in 
part for my disappointment by Monday's post. I set 
my heart on one letter a week, and as many more as 
you please.

I cannot say that my desire of fame increases. It 
has been strong in some parts of my life, but never 
so strong as my love of honesty. I never in my life, 
that I know of, sacrificed my principles or duty to 
popularity or reputation. I hope I am now too old 
ever to do it. But one knows not how trials may be 
borne till they are made. The hell-hounds are now 
in full cry in the newspapers against the President, 
whom they treat as ill as ever they did me. The 
same insolent and impudent Irishman who is said to 
have written so much against me, is now suspected 
to be writing against him. 
</p><p>
Both houses of Congress are making strict inquisition into the treasury, with upright and patriotic 
views, no doubt. Hamilton will find ho more mercy 
than is due from a generous nation to a faithful servant. But I presume his character will shine the 
brighter. However, it is still but an experiment 
whether the ministers of state under an elective executive, will not be overborne by an elective legislature. I believe it to be certain that two elective 
houses of legislation, or even one, have it in their 
power whenever they shall have it in their will, to 
render any minister of state, or even any elective executive, unpopular, though he may be possessed of 
the best talents and most perfect integrity. I presume 
that neither of our houses will be disposed to such 
injustice, but the time may come. 
</p><p>
I am so well satisfied with my present simplicity, 
that I am determined never to depart from it again, 
so far as I have. My expenses in future, forever, 
shall at all events be within my income, nay, within 
my salary. I will no longer be the miserable dupe 
of vanity. My style of life is quite popular. What 
say you to living with me in lodgings next winter ? 
This shall be my plan, if I cannot hire a house for 
six months only. Your friends, who are very numerous, inquire tenderly after your health. Benson 
says he is for making <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='spouse met friend'>Mrs. Adams</a> Autocratrix of the 
United States. This, however, must be secret, be 
cause it is a sort of treason. 
</p><p>
Tenderly yours, 
</p><p>
