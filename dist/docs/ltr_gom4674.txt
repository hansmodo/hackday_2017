Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received despatches, which I think it important 
to communicate to you, with the least possible delay. I therefore hasten to send you them, in the original r begging you 
to return them to me, when you have read them. I am persuaded, Sir, that you will find in them multiplied proofs of a 
sincere attachment on the part of the United States, and of 
their determination to fulfil exactly their engagements with the 
French nation. Unhappily, they will show you, that the 
agent, whom you employed to maintain harmony between our 
two Republics, has been at least indiscreet, and that interests 
the most essential are, in his hands, seriously endangered. 
</p><p>
I regret much that the letter of June the 13th, which our 
Secretary of State mentions to me, did not reach me. I 
might in that case have acquainted you earlier with an evil, 
the more dangerous, as distance prevents the application 
of a speedy remedy. I have the honor to be, &tc. 
</p><p>
