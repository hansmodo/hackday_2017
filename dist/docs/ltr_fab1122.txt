We have completed our repairs and are ready for sea. We have filled up our water casks for the sixth time and have bought a goat so we shall have milk as long as she lives.

We saw the island of Hawaii, also Maui, Molokai and Oahu. I see by the Polynesian that Judd, on his return from his tour with the two princesses, presented the King with two daguerreotypes from A. G. Benson.* I supposed A. G. entertained the royal kanakas. Wonder if the portraits were A. G.'s family?
