SHIP " HURON " OFF LOBOS, 
February 28, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
... In my last I spoke of the little Isle of Lobos, 
which lies in latitude 21 26 . This little gem of the 
ocean, hitherto only known to pirates and solitary 
cruisers in the Gulf, will now have its fame widely 
blown over the United States. It is about seven miles 
from the main and has been created by the gradual 
rise of the coral reef which spreads on every side of it, 
and is near the surface to the east and west for at least 
a mile. Besides the caoutchouc tree, wild oranges, 
lemons, and limes are growing on this little spot, and 
are now opening their sweet blossoms, filling the evening air with delicious fragrance. Some curious speci 
mens of coral have been collected by the volunteer 
officers encamped on the island, such as coralized 
wood, bulbous roots, lemons, and oranges, astonish 
ingly perfect. The smallpox having broken out on 
a transport ship, the Island where the sick are placed 
has been quarantined by order of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>, or I 
should make search for something for a memento. . . . 
March 2. This morning with the captain of the ship 
and Lieutenant Myers I went fishing at daylight in a 
small boat. It was raining when we started but when 
the sun rose the weather cleared. We dropped our 
little anchor off the breakers of the east reef in about 
twenty fathoms and prepared our lines for sport, but 
finding it necessary almost immediately to shift our 
ground, we endeavored to raise our anchor but to our 
great disappointment found it fast tangled in the 
coral. It resisted all our efforts and finally the cable 
parted and we were obliged to pull back to the ship.

. . . After breakfast we saw a signal from the main 
mast of the " Massachusetts " for an officer and a 
boat from each ship, and an order was communicated 
to make all sail for Anton Lizardo. The wind was 
very light and dead ahead, but the steamers on board 
which are the Generals and their staffs paddled off 
to the southeast and were soon out of sight. In the 
afternoon the wind rose, when as if by magic this large 
fleet spread their sails to the breeze and stood away 
close hauled upon the wind to the southwest. I went 
to masthead to gaze upon this glorious spectacle, one 
which few men ever see, such as I never expect to 
look upon again. . . . 
</p><p>
March 4. The wind shifted to the north at two 
o clock this morning and is blowing a cracking breeze. 
We are crowding sail and are gradually passing most 
of the fleet. We are at noon eighty miles from San 
Juan. At two in the afternoon we saw the high mountains to the northwest of Vera Cruz. There were 
nineteen sail in sight all crowding on to the scene of 
action. The beautiful little Nautilus are scudding by 
us in numbers, their tiny sails hoisted and their variegated colors glistening in the bright sun. Query ? 
Are they too going to war, or like Columbus, on a 
voyage of discovery, or thus dressed in holiday suits 
in the service of some sea Venus ?

March 5. This morning there was a dead calm, at 
eight a very faint breeze fanned us slowly along. 
About nine we saw the high peak of Orizaba looking 
like a point of burnished silver in the sky. Its summit 
more than three miles in height covered with eternal 
snows is the first object which meets the eye of the 
mariner as he approaches Vera Cruz. It lies between 
forty and fifty miles inland and looks as little like a 
mountain when first seen as possible, for it could not 
be distinguished from a cloud reflecting the sun did it 
not remain immovable and unchangeable in shape. I 
went to the head of the foremast, and lay over the 
fore topsail yard until in the dim distance the castle of 
San Juan and the city could be seen. Some shipping, 
probably English and French men-of-war, are lying 
at anchor in the roadstead of Sacrificios. It is eleven 
in the morning and before night we shall be at anchor 
at Anton Lizardo. We are near the scene of our 
struggle and tis strange that all doubt and misgiving 
seems to leave my mind as the place and time comes 
near, and though I am as likely to be killed in the 
coming conflict as any other it does not so seem 
to me. A celebrated author says: " All men think 
all men mortal but themselves, themselves immortal." 
March 6. As we drew towards the anchorage at An 
ton Lizardo yesterday we found ourselves in the midst 
of a fleet of ships and steamers. I counted over sixty 
vessels including the men-of-war (two tall ships and 
a war steamer) which are keeping up the blockade of 
the castle, their tapering spars plainly visible traced 
on the bright blue sky. We dropped our anchor about 
four o clock, just inside the reef which forms the harbor. We were in the rear and far from our chief, 
General Worth. A steamer soon came alongside to 
take us to our proper position. She had just left the 
blockade at Vera Cruz and brought us most interest 
ing news Santa Anna s official report of his battle 
with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> at Buena Vista. He admits 
enough to show that he has been well whipped, though 
he claims a victory, and strangely enough says he is 
about to retreat to Agua Nueva. It must have been 
a bloody and desperately contested action lasting 
through two days, the twenty-second and twenty- 
third of February. You will undoubtedly see the 
accounts from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> long before we shall 
here. I am exceedingly anxious to hear from Webster, who, you know, was there. We also heard by the 
steamer that the castle of San Juan and the city are 
manned by less than five thousand soldiers and but 
badly supplied with provisions. We shall probably 
have no difficulty in taking the place. This morning 
I called on Uncle Edmund and spoke to my brother 
as I passed his ship. They are both well and in fine 
spirits. We see occasionally a few Mexican Dragoons 
riding on the beach opposite our position. As they 
are nearly three miles off they do not appear very 
warlike. The coast shows no signs of habitation in 
our neighborhood. If the ordnance and horses were 
here, I suppose we should land immediately they 
are constantly expected and we cannot long be 
delayed. 
</p><p>
This morning Generals Scott, Patterson, Worth, 
and Pillow, with their staff, went in the small steamer, 
" Secretary," captured from the Mexicans, to reconnoitre the castle and city. They had been gone some 
hours and were near San Juan when we saw the flash 
and soon heard the deep sound of the heavy guns of 
the castle. They had approached within gunshot and 
were fired upon. Ten shells and one solid shot were 
thrown at them before they were out of range. The 
stupidity of the enemy alone saved them. The enemy 
should have used their entire water battery and 
thrown solid shot alone, opening on the boat when 
nearest and they must have sunk it, but they 
waited until she was going off and then with no effect 
sent only the eleven shot spoken of. ...

March 7. It is rumored that we are to commence 
our landing tonight I doubt it. It is now four in 
the afternoon and the adjutant has gone to General 
Worth for orders. . . . The enemy have been driving 
cattle into the city, evidently preparing for a siege. . . . 
The adjutant has returned with the order for us to 
land at break of day from the war ship "Raritan." 
The point of debarkation is three or four miles below 
the city, opposite to the Island of Sacrificios. What 
awaits us on shore is all conjecture. It is not probable, 
however, that our landing will be opposed, as the 
enemy cannot be aware of the point or concentrate 
a force there. . . . We are to carry nothing with us 
but a great coat, a haversack with four days provisions in it, and a canteen of water. . . . Now, 
hurrah for San Juan and a brevet ! I have written 
this with all the officers about me talking like mad to 
each other and to me. Major Scott says: " Give my 
best respects to your wife, and tell her we are going 
on the Flagship and shall take the first battery ! "
