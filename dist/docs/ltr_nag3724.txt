Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter, of the oOth July, I have 
had the honor to receive, before the receipt of which 
I had sent off two of my Aids to give your Excellency a very particular account of the Southern department. 
</p><p>
By Colonel Morris, I wrote my opinion respecting 
the proper objects to operate against, should we be so 
happy as to be joined by our good ally. I presume 
he is with your Excellency before this, as the Marquis informs me you were to be at the Head of Elk 
the 8th of this instant, on your way to take command 
in Virginia, and that our good ally was in the Chesapeake with a large fleet and a considerable land force. 
I wish most devotedly that glory and success may 
attend you. I was in hopes that our force would 
have been equal to a serious attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; 
but, from your present plan of operations, I persuade 
myself that it is not the case. But, perhaps, cutting 
off the possibility of succour to New Y'ork first, may 
be the most sure way of laying a foundation for its 
reduction. If Cornwallis falls, which I think nothing 
can prevent but his escaping through North Carolina 
to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> itself may be easily reduced, 
if you will bend your forces this way. And it will 
afford me great pleasure to join your Excellency in 
the attempt ; for I shall be equally happy, whether as 
principal or subordinate, so that the public good is 
promoted. 
</p><p>
Since I wrote to you before, we have had a most 
bloody battle. It was by far the most obstinate fight I ever saw. Victory was ours ; and had it not been 
for one of those little incidents which frequently happen in the progress of war, we should have taken the 
whole British army. Nothing could exceed the gallantry of our officers, or the bravery of the troops. 
I do myself the honor to inclose you a copy of my 
letter to Congress, and beg leave to refer you to 
Captain Pierce, one of my Aids, who is the bearer, 
and who will give your Excellency a full history of 
all matters in this department, both as to force and 
supplies. I am trying to collect a body of militia to 
oppose Lord Cornwallis, should he attempt to escape 
through North Carolina. And you may rest assured 
nothing shall be left unattempted, in my power, to 
impede his march, so as to give your army time to 
get up with him ; but my force is very small, and I 
am exceedingly embarrassed with numerous wounded. 
I have the honor to be, with great respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
