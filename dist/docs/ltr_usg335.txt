DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
Your letter enclosing one from young Walker asking for duty on my staff
during his suspension is received. It is the third letter from him on
the same subject. Of course I cannot gratify him. It would not be
proper. It would be changing punishment into reward.
</p><p>
Julia will start West in a few days and will stop at Covington on her
way. She will remain at the house I purchased from Judge Dent until
such time as she can join me more permanently. It is her particular
desire to have Jennie go to St. Louis with her to spend the summer. I
hope she can and will go.
</p><p>
It has rained here almost every day since my arrival. It is still
raining. Of course I say nothing of when the army moves or how or
where. I am in most excellent health and well pleased with appearances
here. My love to all at home.
</p>
ULYSSES.
