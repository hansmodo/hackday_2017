DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I think the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>ers have been very discreet in forbearing to write and publish against the late act of Parliament. I wish the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> people had been as quiet, since 
Governor Bernard has sent over all their violent papers to 
the ministry, and wrote them word that he daily expected a 
rebellion. He did indeed afterwards correct this extravagance, by writing again, that he now understood those papers 
were approved but by few, and disliked by all the sober, 
sensible people of the province. A certain noble Lord expressed himself to me with some disgust and contempt of 
Bernard on this occasion, saying he ought to have known his 
people better, than to impute to the whole country sentiments, that perhaps are only scribbled by some madman in 
a garret ; that he appeared to be too fond of contention, and 
mistook the matter greatly, in supposing such letters as he 
wrote were acceptable to the ministry. I have heard nothing 
of the appointment of General Clark to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; but I 
know he is a friend of Lord Shelburne's, and the same that 
recommended Mr. M'Lean to be his secretary. Perhaps it 
might be talked of in my absence. 
</p><p>
The commissioners for the American Board, went hence 
while I was in France ; you know before this time who they 
are and how they are received, which I want to hear. Mr. Williams, who is gone in some office with them, is brother to 
our cousin Williams of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; but I assure you I had not the 
least share in his appointment ; having, as I told you before, 
carefully kept out of the way of that whole affair. 
</p><p>
As soon as I received Mr. Galloway's, Mr. T. Wharton's, 
and Mr. Croghan's letters on the subject of the boundary, 
I communicated them immediately to Lord Shelburne. He 
invited me the next day to dine with him. Lord Clare was 
to have been there, but did not come. There was nobody 
but Mr. M'Lean. My Lord knew nothing of the boundary's 
having ever been agreed on by Sir William, had sent the letters 
to the Board of Trade, desiring search to be made there for 
Sir William's letters, and ordered Mr. M'Lean to search the 
secretary's office, who found nothing. We had much discourse about it, and I pressed the importance of despatching 
orders immediately to Sir William to complete the affair. 
His Lordship asked who was to make the purchase, that is, 
be at the expense ? I said that if the line included any lands 
within the grants of the charter colonies, they should pay 
the purchase money of such proportion. If any within the 
proprietary grants, they should pay their proportion; but 
that what was within royal governments, where the King 
granted the lands, the crown should pay for that proportion. 
His Lordship was pleased to say he thought this reasonable. 
He finally desired me to go to Lord Clare, as from him, and 
urge the business there, which I undertook to do. 
</p><p>
Among other things at this conversation, we talked of the 
new settlement ; his Lordship told me he had himself drawn 
up a paper of reasons for those settlements, which he laid 
before the King in Council, acquainting them that he did not 
offer them merely as his own sentiments; they were what 
he had collected from General Amherst, Dr. Franklin, and 
Mr. Jackson, three gentlemen that were allowed to be the 
best authorities for any thing that related to America. I 
think he added that the Council seemed to approve of the 
</p><p>
design. I know it was referred to the Board of Trade, who 
I believe have not yet reported on it, and I doubt will report 
against it. My Lord told me one pleasant circumstance, viz. 
that he had shown his paper to the Dean of Gloucester 
(Tucker), to hear his opinion of the matter; who very 
sagaciously remarked, that he was sure that paper was drawn 
up by Dr. Franklin ; he saw him in every paragraph ; adding 
that Dr. Franklin wanted to remove the seat of government to 
America ; that, says he, is his constant plan. 
</p><p>
I waited next morning upon Lord Clare, and pressed the 
matter of the boundary closely upon him. He said they 
could not find they had ever received any letters from Sir 
William concerning this boundary, but were searching farther : 
agreed to the necessity of settling it ; but thought there would 
be some difficulty about who should pay the purchase money ; 
for that this country was already so loaded, it could bear no 
more. We then talked of the new colonies. I found he was 
inclined to think one near the mouth of the Ohio might be of 
use in securing the country, but did not much approve that 
at Detroit. And as to the trade, he imagined it would be of 
little consequence, if we had all the peltry to be purchased 
there, but supposed our traders would sell it chiefly to the 
French and Spaniards, at <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, as he heard they 
had hitherto done. 
</p><p>
At the same time that we Americans wish not to be judged 
of, in the gross, by particular papers written by anonymous 
scribblers and published in the colonies, it would be well if 
we could avoid falling into the same mistake in America, in 
judging of ministers here by the libels printed against them. 
The inclosed is a very abusive one, in which if there is any 
foundation of truth, it can only be in the insinuation contained 
</p><p>
in the words "after eleven adjournments" that they are too 
apt to postpone business ; but if they have given any occasion 
for this reflection, there are reasons and circumstances that 
may be urged in their excuse. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to hear that the people of the other 
colonies are not insensible of the zeal with which I occasionally espouse their respective interests, as well as the interests 
of the whole. I shall continue to do so as long as I reside 
here and am able. 
</p><p>
The present ministry seem now likely to continue through 
this session of Parliament; and perhaps if the new Parliament should not differ greatly in complexion from this, they 
may be fixed for a number of years, which I earnestly wish, 
as we have no chance for a better. B. FRANKLIN.
