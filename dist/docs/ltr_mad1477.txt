DEAR SIR, Yours of 24th ultimo came safe by yesterday's 
post. In addition to the paper of this day, I enclose you two 
of the preceding week, in one of which you will find a very 
entertaining and interesting speech of Mr. Fox, and in the other, 
a handsome forensic discussion of a case important in itself, 
and which has some relation to the State of Virginia.

Our intelligence from N. York through several channels confirms the sufferings of the British fleet from their rash visit to 
the capes of the Chesapeake. The troops which were kept in 
transports to await that event have, since the return of the 
fleet, been put on shore on Staten Island. This circumstance 
has been construed into a preliminary to an expedition to this 
city, which had revived, till within a few days, the preparations 
for a militia opposition, but is better explained by the raging 
of a malignant fever in the city of N. York. Digby, we hear, 
is now certainly arrived, but with three ships of the line only. 
It is given out that three men with a large number of transports 
came with him, and that they only lay back till it was known 
whether they could proceed to N. Y. with safety. This is not 
improbably suspected to be a trick to palliate the disappointment and to buoy up the sinking hopes of their adherents, the 
most staunch of whom give up Lord Cornwallis as irretrievably lost.

We have received some communications from Europe relative 
to the general state of its affairs. They all centre in three 
important points. The first is the obstinacy of Great Britain; 
the second, the fidelity of our ally; and the third, the absolute 
necessity of vigorous and systematic preparations for war on 
our part, in order to insure a speedy, as well as favorable 
peace. The wisdom of the Legislature of Virginia will, I flatter 
myself, not only prevent an illusion from the present brilliant 
prospects, but take advantage of the military ardor and sanguine hopes of the people to recruit their line for the war. The 
introduction of specie will also, I hope, be made subserv.nt to 
some salutary operations in their finances. Another great 
object, which, in my opinion, claims an immediate attention 
from them, is some liberal provision for extending the benefits 
of government to the distant parts of the State. I am not able 
to see why this cannot be done so as fully to satisfy the exigencies of the people, and at the same time preserv.the idea of 
unity in the State. Any plan which divides in any manner the 
sovereignty may be dangerous, and precipitate an evil which 
ought, and may at least, be long procrastinated. The administration of justice, which is the capital branch, may certainly be 
diffused sufficiently, and kept in due subordination in every part 
to one supreme tribunal. Separate boards for crediting [auditing?] accounts may also be admitted with safety and propriety. 
The same as to a separate depository for the taxes, &c., and as to a land office. The military powers of the Executive may well 
be intrusted to militia officers of rank, as far as the defence of 
the country and the custody of military stores make it necessary. A complete organization of the militia, in which general 
officers would he erected, would greatly facilitate this part of the 
plan. Such an one, with a council of field officers, might exercise, without encroaching on the constitutional powers of the 
supreme Executive, all the powers over the militia which any 
emergency could demand. 
</p><p>
I am, Dr Sir, yours sincerely.
