MY PEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had, a few days since, the honor of your favor 
of the 12th ultimo, by <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, announcing 
that the Virginia line were ordered to this department, than which nothing could be more acceptable, 
saving that of their not being needed. Their speedy 
arrival is an event most ardently wished for. 
</p><p>
By our late accounts from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and from a large ship being seen off this bar on the 10th, 
with troops on board, said to be from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, we are led to believe that the enemy will 
be early reenforced in Georgia. From that idea, and 
from a belief that this town will be the object which 
will claim their first attention, I have requested the 
Governor of this State to order into <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> a number of his militia, to relieve the Continental troops there; all of which I mean to draw, as soon as possible, into such post as will facilitate their being 
thrown suddenly to a point. 
</p><p>
I find myself greatly embarrassed to know what 
ground to occupy; for, if we draw them into this 
town or its vicinity, and the enemy should attempt 
the same route as the last year, we shall lose the 
advantages of opposing them at the several strong passes between this town and the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. If we 
should throw the troops near that river, from an idea 
that the enemy will cross it, and instead of that they 
should take shipping, and land between us and this 
town, they will shut us out of it; the consequence 
of which would, I think, be its loss. Besides, if we 
keep the troops near this town, and the enemy should 
land northward of the bar, they will, in that case, 
probably reach Haddrel's Point before us, and there 
by Fort Moultrie will be in danger. If we divide our few troops, there will be danger that we shall 
be beaten in detachment. 
</p><p>
It is, my dear Sir, among my first misfortunes, that 
I am not near enough to your Excellency to have 
the advantage of your advice and direction. But this 
I cannot enjoy. I feel my own insufficiency and 
want of experience. I can promise you nothing but a disposition to serve my country. If this town 
should be attacked, as now threatened, I know my 
duty will call me to defend it as long as opposition 
can be of any avail. I hope my inclination will coincide with my duty. 
</p><p>
If the enemy mean seriously to attack this town, 
I think, previous thereto, they will have their emissaries in the back part of this country to stimulate 
the Indians, and the unfriendly, to acts of hostility. 
We have, therefore, to guard against their baneful influence as much as possible. For this purpose, it is 
necessary that we at all times keep a body of men 
in arms near the inland frontiers. I have requested 
the Governor of North Carolina, immediately on the 
attack of this town, to embody a number of militia, 
and march them towards the frontiers of his State, 
where there are many disaffected people ; as they 
would not only quell any disturbance there, but, in 
case they should not be needed for that purpose, 
they might march this way, and serve as a reenforcement to us. 
</p><p>
Two of ours, and the French frigates, are going out 
to see what discoveries they can make. They would 
have gone sooner, but the French ships had not 
water over the bar, and ours were out of repair. 
</p><p>
I have requested the Governor of Virginia to order shoes, stockings, and other clothing to be sup 
plied the troops on their march, and that he would 
forward clothing here for their future supply. I wish, 
if you approve of the application, that you would 
support it. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry that <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, after waiting a number of days, could not get a passage by 
water as he expected; for thereby, my letter to you, 
instead of being the first, was long detained, and the 
consequence was that you received the information of 
our raising the siege before <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> from Congress, 
when you ought to have had it from me. Though I 
was in hopes that I had given too great evidence of 
my attachment to you, to believe that it was from a 
designed neglect, yet I could not so fully rely on the 
candor of the world, and was afraid that it would be 
construed to my disadvantage, and that some might 
attempt to persuade your Excellency that I have not 
really that attachment and esteem which I have al 
ways expressed. I hope no such attempt has been 
made, for nothing could be more injurious. 
</p><p>
(Since I began this letter, what was before 
conjecture, is now nearly reduced to a certainty ; 
namely, that the enemy mean a descent on this 
State, which probably will happen soon. Yesterday,a vessel was decoyed into this harbour, by a tender 
to our Continental frigates, bound from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, in company with a fleet of about ninety 
sail, bound to that port, convoyed by the following ships, namely; three seventy-fours, three sixty-fours, 
one fifty-four, one forty, and one frigate ; the Europe, 
Russel, Roebuck, Robust, Renown, Defiance, Romulus, 
and Perseus. She was separated from the fleet off 
Cape Hat-terns, in a storm, about twenty days since. 
She has on board a few bales of clothing, some furniture, &c., but the whole, as it is said, of inconsider 
able amount. Passengers in her, one Lieutenant and 
one Ensign in the British service, besides other passengers; and five privates in Robinson's corps. 
</p><p>
This news has induced me to write to Governor 
Jefferson and Governor Caswell, requesting them to 
give every possible assistance to facilitate the march 
of the troops ordered from the main army to reenforce this. I have the honor to be, my dear General, with the greatest regard and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
