My dear General, 
</p><p>
The Convention this evening ratified the Constitution ; present, three hundred and fifty-five members ; 
one hundred and eighty-seven yeas, and one hundred 
and sixty-eight nays; nineteen majority in favor of 
the adoption. 
</p><p>
As I mentioned to you in my last, the spirit which operated the last winter had its influence in the appointment of members for the Convention, and was a 
clog upon us through the whole business. To this source may be ascribed the great opposition we have 
experienced through the long debates, and the smallness of the majority. I hope the neighbouring States 
will consider this, and not suffer it to weigh in their decisions. 
</p><p>
Yesterday there was a motion for an adjournment, 
which cost us the whole day. Upon the question at 
evening, there were about one hundred majority 
against it; this was a damper upon the opposition, 
and they had little hope after. When, this evening, 
the question went against them, some of the leaders 
arose, and assured the Convention, that they were convinced that the debates had been conducted with 
fairness and candor, and that they should return with 
dispositions to satisfy the minds of their constituents, 
and to preserve the peace and order of the people at 
large. I hope and trust they will, and that we shall 
soon enjoy the blessings of a good government. 
</p><p>
I shall continue to write to your Excellency, whilst 
any thing relative to this great subject shall turn up 
here worthy your notice. Forgive the haste \ the 
post-office will be shut. And believe me, with the 
sincerest esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
My dear General, &c.,

P. S. Upon the issue of the question, every demonstration of joy was discovered among the people.
