My Dear Brother: . . . What in the devil are you 
doing? Stump speaking! I really thought you were 
too decent for that, or at least had sufficient pride not to 
humble and cringe to beg party or popular favor. However, the coming election will sufficiently prove the intelligence and patriotic spirit of the American people, and 
may deter you from committing a like sin again. . . . 
For my part, I wish Henry Clay to be elected, and 
should rejoice in his success, for various reasons, but I 
do not permit myself to indulge in sanguine feelings 
when dependence has to be placed on the pitch-and-toss 
game of party elections. 
</p><p>
I rejoice in the winter period of relaxation to enable 
me to devote more time to reading. Look out that I 
don't turn out a pettifogging lawyer, and rival you in 
fame at some cross-roads in the Far West. . . . 
</p><p>
Let me conclude by hoping that you will now in the 
outset of life do all things in your power to advance 
your interest and fame, and to neglect no chance to better 
your fortune. . . . 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
