On Monday afternoon the editor, Mr. White, and his better half, Atkins and myself went out on a gold-seeking expedition, with pick, spade and pan and as an accompaniment (the water being bad) a bottle of good wine, and washed for an hour in one of the neighboring gulches, taking out about two dollars, which we have carefully put away with the view of having it made into ornaments.

On Wednesday a large number of wild Indians, both men and women, passed through our town on their way to the Tuolumne River. Many of them were almost nude, having nothing but a shirt on or blanket wrapped around them; the men with their bows and arrows, the women with their long conical baskets slung over their backs, kept from falling by a strap passing over the tops of their heads. The women appeared to do all the drudgery, having their baskets, which hold about a bushel each, well filled with meat which they gather wherever they can, not scrupling to kill any one's horse or ox if they fail in finding elk or deer.

At Slater's ranch, within three miles of Sonora, two warriors of the party attempted to steal several horses kept by a Mexican. At their approach the Mexican posted himself behind a tree and while in this position, they fired three arrows at him, one of which took effect in the left arm, near the shoulder, passing clear through it. He then fired a pistol at them which had the effect to drive them off. The Mexican was brought into town where the arrow was extracted and the wound dressed by a skilful surgeon. The Indians also attempted to steal a cow and a calf from a butcher a mile or two from this place but were foiled in their attempt and driven away. A party of armed Americans started out
in pursuit of the Indians Thursday morning, but they have returned without overtaking them.

On the same day two Frenchmen found the remains of an American a few miles from town, evidently murdered, with the head lying several rods from the body, the pockets and belt cut open as with a knife, and the body much mutilated and torn by the coyotes.

About ten o'clock that night, after I had turned in, I heard a rapping at my door and upon opening, who should enter but the sheriff and levy on one half of the office. This startled me, but I rested well until morning when I found that it was seized upon for a debt owing by one of the partners. The proceedings were stopped and the paper was permitted to go on, by the partner's selling his interest in the concern to his creditor. I have now $467 due me from them and they have promised me money every day for a week, but as yet I have received nary a red cent.
