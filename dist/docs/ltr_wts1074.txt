My Dear General:
</p><p>
I was surprised beyond measure to hear yesterday from Colonel Rowe, who brought me a copy of Governor Johnson's letter to you of June 4, that you expressed a determination not to risk the issuance of arms to the militia of this State, under the present aspect of things.
</p><p>
After your assent to the Governor's request in my presence to issue such arms as would be required in the present emergency, I cannot think that Colonel Rowe could have got the exact meaning of your reply.
</p><p>
Governor Johnson has issued a proclamation and I have issued orders for the enrollment of the militia. And already several companies have reported, and many more are known to be progressing in the work. Now if we cannot count on getting arms and ammunition as a certainty I should know it as soon as possible. I assure you on my honor that I will not call for a musket or a cartridge till I am dead certain that the arming the militia will at o c store authority to its legitimate channels. If the number of men or if the character of the men who offer their services are such as I am not willing to command, I will not receive their service.
</p><p>
But I think, my dear General, I should know at once-. to-night if possible -by the Stockton Boat, whether in case I call for arms I can have them.
</p><p>
Your friend and servant,

Major-General, California Militia.
