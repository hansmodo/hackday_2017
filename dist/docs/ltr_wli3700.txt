Sir, 
</p><p>
At the time Congress directed me to repair to this place, I took for granted your Excellency would have 
information thereof through different channels ; and 
knowing how very particularly you were at that moment engaged, I did not think proper to give unnecessary trouble. This, I flatter myself, will excuse 
me to your Excellency for not writing sooner. Previous to my arrival, Colonel Gibson had received 
your letter directing him to take the command, which 
was acquiesced in by <a href='/results.php?tla=dab' rel='colleague'>Colonel Brodhead</a> ; and things 
went on in the usual channel, except that the dispute occasioned Colonel Gibson's intended expedition 
against Sandusky being laid aside, and perhaps it the intention of Congress by consulting with and employing the assistance of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, in accelerating the supplies which 
may be afforded by his Most Christian Majesty for the use of the United States ; 
</p><p>
" That the Superintendent of Finance, the Secretary for Foreign 
Affairs, and the Board of War, make such communications to the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, touching the affairs of their respective departments, as will best enable him to fulfil the purpose of the two resolutions immediately preceding ; 
</p><p>
" That the Superintendent of Finance take order for discharging the 
engagement entered into by the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> with the merchants of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, referred to in the act of the 24th of May last. 
</p><p>
" Ordered, That the Superintendent of Finance furnish the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> with a proper conveyance to France; 
</p><p>
" That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs report a letter to his Most 
Christian Majesty, to be sent by the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>." 
</p><p>
When Lafayette was marching from the Head of Elk to Virginia, 
the citizens of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> contributed very liberally to assist him in 
furnishing supplies of clothing to his troops. On the 24th of May, the 
following resolve, alluded to above, was passed; â€” 
</p><p>
" Resolved, That Congress entertain a just sense of the patriotic and 
timely exertions of the merchants of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, who so generously supplied the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> with about two thousand guineas, to 
enable him to forward the detachment under his command; 
</p><p>
"That the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> be assured that Congress will take 
proper measures to discharge the engagements he has entered into with 
the merchants." 
</p><p>
also prevented many other necessary arrangements. 
The examination of evidences, on the charges against <a href='/results.php?tla=dab' rel='colleague'>Colonel Brodhead</a>, are still taking, and I am informed will continue some weeks. 
</p><p>
Agreeably to my orders from Congress, to retain 
no more officers here than sufficient for the men, I 
have made the following arrangements. Reformed the 
remains of the late eighth Pennsylvania regiment into 
two companies, and call them a detachment from the 
Pennsylvania line, to be commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Bayard. <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> had some time as-o 
directed Colonel Gibson to reform his regiment also 
into two companies, retaining with him the Staff of 
the regiment; and to send all the supernumerary 
officers down into Virginia. The reformation w\is so 
made ; but the officers were so distressed, for want of 
clothing and other necessaries, that they were not 
able to proceed ; however they are now making exertions, and I hope will soon set out. I have ordered 
the supernumerary officers of the Pennsylvania line 
to repair forthwith to their proper regiments in the 
line. The whole of the troops, here, are thrown into 
four companies. I have been trying to economize ; 
but every thing is in so wretched a state, that there 
is very little in my power. I never saw troops cut 
so truly a deplorable, and at the same time despicable, a figure. Indeed, when I arrived, no man would 
believe, from their appearance, that they were soldiers ; nay, it would be difficult to determine whether 
they were ivldte men. Though they do not yet come up to my wishes, they are somewhat better. 
</p><p>
As it does not rest with me to decide on the propriety or impropriety of any person's conduct, I shall 
only make a few general observations. The consumption of public stores has, in my opinion, been enormous ; particularly military stores. And I fear the reasons given for it will not be justifiable ; namely, that 
the militia would all fly, if they had not powder and 
lead given them, not only when in service, but also 
to keep in their houses. It is true, the County Lieutenants, and others who are called responsible men, 
have promised to be accountable; but I am certain, 
that not an ounce can ever be again collected. I 
find, by the returns, that near two thousand pounds 
of powder, and four thousand pounds of lead, have 
been issued to the militia since the dispute commenced between Colonels Brodhead and Gibson, chiefly 
by orders of the former, beside arms, accoutrements, 
&c., and not a man called into actual service. The 
magazine is nearly exhausted. There is not now as 
much remaining as has been issued since the first of 
last September. 
</p><p>
I presume your Excellency has been informed by the Governor of Virginia, or General Clark, of the 
failure of his expedition. But lest that should not 
be the case, I will relate all the particulars that have 
come to my knowledge. Captain Craig, with the detachment of artillery under him, returned here the 
26th instant. He got up with much difficulty, and 
great fatigue to the men, being forty days on the 
way, occasioned by the lowness of the river. He 
was obliged to throw away his gun-carriages, but 
brought his pieces and best stores safe. He left 
General Clark at the Rapids ; and says the General was not able to prosecute his intended plan 
of operation, for want of men, being able to collect, 
in the whole, only about seven hundred and fifty, 
and the buffalo meat was all rotten; and adds, the 
General is apprehensive of a visit from Detroit, and 
is not without fears the settlement will be obliged to 
break up, unless reenforcements soon arrive from Virginia. The Indians have been so numerous in that 
country, that all the inhabitants have been obliged to 
keep close in forts, and the General could not venture 
out to fight them. 
</p><p>
A Colonel Lochrey, Lieutenant of Westmoreland 
county, in Pennsylvania, with about one hundred men 
in all, composed of volunteers, and a company raised 
by Pennsylvania for the defence of said county, followed General Clark, who, 'tis said, ordered Lochrey 
to join him at the mouth of Miami, up which river 
it had previously been agreed on to proceed. But 
General Clark, having changed his plan, left a small 
party at Miami, with directions to Lochrey to proceed on to the Falls after him, with the main body. 
Sundry accounts agree that this party, and all Lochrey's, to a man, were waylaid by Indians and regulars 
(for it is asserted they had artillery), and all killed 
or taken. No man, however, escaped either to join 
General Clark or return home. When Captain Craig 
left the General, he could not be persuaded but that Lochrey with his party had returned home. These 
misfortunes throw the people of this country into the 
greatest consternation and almost despair, particularly 
Westmoreland county, Lochrey's party being all the 
best men of that frontier. At present they talk of 
flying early in spring to the eastern side of the 
mountain, and are daily flocking to me to inquire 
what support they may expect. 
</p><p>
I think there is but too much reason to fear that 
General Clark's and Colonel Gibson's expeditions falling through, will greatly encourage the savages to 
fall on the country with double fury, or perhaps the 
British, from Detroit, to visit this post, which, instead 
of being in a tolerable state of defence, is in fact nothing but a heap of ruins. I need not inform 
your Excellency that it is, at best, but a bad situation for defence. I have been viewing all the ground 
in this vicinity, and find none equal for a post to 
the mouth of Shirter's Creek, about four miles down 
the river. This was pointed out to me by Captain 
Hutchins before I left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, who says there 
is no place equal to it anywhere within forty miles of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. 
</p><p>
I think it best calculated on many accounts. First, 
the ground is such that works may be constructed to 
contain any number of men you please, from fifty to 
one thousand. It is by nature almost inaccessible on 
three sides, and on the fourth no commanding ground 
within three thousand yards. Secondly, as it would 
effectually cover the settlement on Shirter's Creek, 
the necessity of keeping a post at Fort Mcintosh 
will of course cease. In case of making that the 
main post. <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> should be demolished, all except 
the north bastion, on which a strong block-house 
should be built. A small party in it would as effectually keep up the communication with the settlements on Monongahela, as the whole garrison now 
does; for the necessary detachments to Fort Mcintosh, Wheeling, &c., so divide the troops, that no one 
place can ever be held without a large body of troops. 
Indeed, I do not like Fort Mcintosh being kept a 
post in the present situation of things. 
</p><p>
If the enemy from Detroit should take into their 
heads to make us a visit, that would be an excellent 
place for them to take by surprise; from whence 
they could send out Indians and other partisans to 
lay the whole country waste before we could dislodge 
them. We have (I think idly) too much of our 
stores there. I have been making efforts to bring up the greater part; but, though it is almost incredible, yet 'tis true that, of all the public boats 
built here, not a single one was there to be found 
when I came here, except one barge and one flat. I 
expect two boats up, loaded, this day. It is, I believe, universally agreed that the only way to keep 
Indians from harassing the country, is to visit them. 
But we find, by experience, that burning their empty 
towns has not the desired effect. They can soon 
build others. They must be followed up and beaten, 
or the British, whom they draw support from, totally 
driven out of their country. 
</p><p>
I believe, if Detroit was demolished, it would be 
a good step towards giving some, at least temporary, ease to this country. It would take at least a 
whole summer to rebuild and establish themselves ; 
for, though we should succeed in reducing Detroit, I 
do not think there is the smallest probability of our 
being able to hold it; it is too remote from supplies. 
I have been endeavouring to form some estimates; 
and, from such information as I can collect, I really 
think that the reduction of Detroit would not cost 
much more, nor take many more men than it will 
take to cover and protect the country by acting on 
the defensive. If I am well informed, it would take 
seven or eight hundred regular troops, and about a 
thousand militia; which number could pretty easily 
be obtained for that purpose, as it appears to be a 
favorite scheme over all this country. The principal 
difficulty would be to get provision and stores transported. As to taking a heavy train of artillery, I 
fear it would not only be impracticable, but an incumbrance ; two field-pieces, some howitz, and perhaps 
a mortar. I do not think, especially under present 
circumstances, that it would be possible to carry on an expedition in such a manner as to promise success 
by a regular siege. I would therefore propose to 
make every appearance of sitting down before the 
place, as if to reduce it by regular approaches ; as 
soon as I found the enemy fully impressed with This 
idea, attempt it at once by assault. 
</p><p>
I mean to write Congress for leave to go down the 
country in January, to return in March, if they make 
a point I should continue here. I can scarcely think 
they will wish me to remain with four companies of 
men. The power of calling out the militia of this 
country, is more ideal than real, especially till the 
lines between Virginia and Pennsylvania are determined, and actually run. Neither civil nor military 
law will take place till then. Whether I am to be 
continued here or not, I am pretty certain it might 
be of use for me to go down, in order the better to 
concert measures proper to be taken, either with your 
Excellency or Congress ; for, as matters now stand, it 
is clear to me this country must be given up. The 
militia, however, promise pretty fair, and I have had 
no ground for differing with them yet. There is no 
provision laid in, nor is there even sufficient from day 
to day. The contract made by <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> for supplying this post, has not been fulfilled on the part of 
the contractor in any tolerable degree ; nor would the 
contract answer here, even if complied with. However, as I must write particularly to the Board of 
War on this subject, and have exceeded moderate 
bounds for a letter, I fear I have already tired, and 
taken up too much of your Excellency's time. I have 
the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant,

P. S. I have been told of three persons who were 
prisoners with the enemy, and have hitely made their 
escape. I have sent in search of them, but could not 
find them out. The Lieutenant of Washington county has promised to bring one of them to me as soon 
as possible. If they have any material accounts, I shall 
inform your Excellency the earliest possible. They 
have come from different places, and I am told all 
agree that great preparations are making to attack 
this country, at several places, at the same time. 
Speaking of prisoners, leads me to beg your Excellency's opinion or instructions respecting an exchange 
in this quarter, or a negotiation carried on with the 
Commander at Detroit. I find numbers of poor people are taken in this district ; some were taken at 
the commencement of the war, and are yet languishing in prison, in Canada, for they send all down to 
<a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a>. I cannot learn that any attempt 
has ever been made, on either side, to exchange them. 
</p><p>
John Hynds and Myndat Fisher have both been 
confined here a whole year, and are under sentence 
of a Court-Martial. I request your Excellency's orders 
respecting them. I am informed the proceedings of 
the Court were sent to head-quarters a considerable 
time since. W. I.
