<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>. Here we are once more. Hon. Robert Barnwell came with us. His 
benevolent spectacles give him a most Pickwickian expression. We Carolinians revere his goodness above all 
things. Everywhere, when the car stopped, the people wanted a speech, and we had one stream of fervid oratory. 
We came along with a man whose wife lived in Washington. He was bringing her to Georgia as the safest place. 
</p><p>
The Alabama crowd are not as confident of taking Fort Pickens as we were of taking Fort Sumter. 
</p><p>
Baltimore is in a blaze. They say Colonel Ben Huger is in command there son of the Olmutz Huger. <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel=''>General Robert E. Lee</a>, son of Light Horse Harry Lee, has been made General-in-Chief of Virginia. With such men to the fore, we have hope. The New York Herald says, Slavery 
must be extinguished, if in blood. It thinks we are shaking in our shoes at their great mass meetings. We are jolly 
as larks, all the same.

Mr. Chesnut has gone with Wade Hampton to see <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>President Davis</a> about the legion Wade wants to get up. 
</p><p>
The President came across the aisle to speak to me at church to-day. He was very cordial, and I appreciated the honor.

Wigfall is black with rage at Colonel Anderson's account of the fall of Sumter. Wigfall did behave magnanimously, but Anderson does not seem to see it in that light. " Catch me risking my life to save him again/ says Wig- fall. " He might have been man enough to tell the truth 
to those New Yorkers, however unpalatable to them a good word for us might have been. We did behave well to him. 
The only men of his killed, he killed himself, or they killed themselves firing a salute to their old striped rag. 
</p><p>
Mr. Chesnut was delighted with the way Anderson spoke to him when he went to demand the surrender. They 
parted quite tenderly. Anderson said: " If we do not meet again on earth, I hope we may meet in Heaven." 
How Wigfall laughed at Anderson " giving Chesnut a howdy in the other world ! : 
</p><p>
What a kind welcome the old gentlemen gave me ! One, more affectionate and homely than the others, slapped me 
on the back. Several bouquets were brought me, and I put them in water around my plate. Then General Owens gave me some violets, which I put in my breastpin. 
</p><p>
"Oh," said my " Gutta Percha " Hemphill, " if I had known how those bouquets were to be honored I would 
have been up by daylight seeking the sweetest flowers! " Governor Moore came in, and of course seats were offered 
him. " This is a most comfortable chair/ cried an overly polite person. " The most comfortable chair is be 
side Mrs. Chesnut," said the Governor, facing the music gallantly, as he sank into it gracefully. Well done, old fogies !

Browne said: " These Southern men have an awfully flattering way with women. " " Oh, so many are descend 
ants of Irishmen, and so the blarney remains yet, even, and 
in spite of their gray hairs ! :l For it was a group of silvergray flatterers. Yes, blarney as well as bravery came in 
with the Irish.

At <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> reception dismal news, for civil war seems certain. At Mrs. Toombs's reception Mr. Stephens 
came by me. Twice before we have had it out on the subject of ,this Confederacy, once on the cars, coming from 
Georgia here, once at a supper, where he sat next to me. To-day he was not cheerful in his views. I called him 
half-hearted, and accused him of looking back. Man after man came and interrupted the conversation with some 
frivle-fravle, but we held on. He was deeply interesting, 
and he gave me some new ideas as to our dangerous situation. Fears for the future and not exultation at our successes pervade his discourse. 
</p><p>
Dined at the President's and never had a pleasanter day. He is as witty as he is wise. He was very agreeable ; 
he took me in to dinner. The talk was of Washington ; nothing of our present difficulties. 
</p><p>
A General Anderson from Alexandria, D. C., was in doleful dumps. He says the North are so much better prepared than we are. They are organized, or will be, by <a href='/results.php?tla=wfs' rel=''>General Scott</a>. We are in wild confusion. Their army is 
the best in the world. We are wretchedly armed, etc., etc. 
They have ships and arms that were ours and theirs. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Walker, resplendently dressed, one of those gorgeously arrayed persons who fairly shine in the sun, tells 
me she mistook the inevitable Morrow for Mr. Chesnut, and added, Pass over the affront to my powers of selection. 
I told her it was an insult to the Palmetto flag. Think of a South Carolina Senator like that ! 
</p><p>
Men come rushing in from Washington with white lips, crying, " Danger, danger! " It is very tiresome to have 
these people always harping on this: " The enemy's troops are the finest body of men we ever saw." " Why 
did you ,not make friends of them, I feel disposed to say. 
We would have war, and now w seem to be letting our 
golden opportunity pass; we are not preparing for war. There is talk, talk, talk in that Congress lazy legislators, 
and rash, reckless, headlong, devil-may-care, proud, passion ate, unruly, raw material for soldiers. They say we have 
among us a regiment of spies, men and women, sent here by the wily <a href='/results.php?tla=wls' rel=''>Seward</a>. Why? Our newspapers tell every 
word there is to be told, by friend or foe. 
</p><p>
A two-hours call from Hon. Robert Barnwell. His theory is, all would have been right if we had taken Fort 
Sumter six months ago. He made this very plain to me. He is clever, if erratic. I forget why it ought to have been 
attacked before. At another reception, <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> was in fine spirits. Captain Dacier was here. Came over in his 
own yacht. Russell, of The London Times, wondered how we had the heart to enjoy life so .thoroughly when all the 
Northern papers said we were to be exterminated in such a short time.
