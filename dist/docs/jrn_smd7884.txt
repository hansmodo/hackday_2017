Yesterday Miriam determined to go to <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a>, and consequently I had a severe task of trunk-packing, one of my greatest delights, however. I 
hate to see any one pack loosely or in a slovenly manner. Perhaps that is the reason I never let any 
one do it if I am able to stand. This morning was appointed as our day for leaving, but I persuaded 
her to wait until to-morrow, in hope that either the General, or news from Virginia, would arrive this 
evening. Bless this village! It is the meanest place for news that I ever was in. Not a word can be 
gathered, except what is false or unfounded; and they are even tired of that, in the last few days. 
</p><p>
Talk of <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> turning Yankee, as the report went here! Of the three or four there who 
took the oath, not one can be compared to some loyal citizens of this small burg. Why, I talked to two 
gentlemen yesterday who, if it were not for the disgrace and danger incurred by bearing the name, I 
should style Union men, and talked or rather listened to them, until my spirits were reduced to the lowest 
ebb. People were shocked at our daring to believe there lived gentlemen and Christians in the North 
I mean those wild fanatics, who could only take in one idea at a time, and rarely divested their brains 
of that one to make room for a newer one, were shocked at our belief; but if they could converse 
with a few here, that I could point out, our gnat of common sense would be swallowed by this behemoth of heterodoxy.

This morning Mrs. Bar, Miss Bernard, and a Miss Mud came to town and surprised us by a most unexpected visit. They spent the day with us, and have 
just now driven off on their return home, through this drizzly, misting evening. A while ago a large cavalry company passed, at the corner, on their way 
from Port Hudson to Camp Moore, the report is. They raised their hats to us, seeing us at the gate, and we waved our handkerchiefs in return, each 
with a silent "God bless you," I am sure.

As though to prove my charge unjust, news comes pouring in. Note we a few items, to see how many will prove false. First, we have taken <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> 
without firing a gun; Maryland has risen en masse to join our troops ; Longstreet and <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel=''>Lee</a> are marching on Washington from the rear; the Louisiana troops are 
ordered home to defend their own State thank God! if it will only bring the boys back! Then comes tidings of nine gunboats at <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>; 
Ponchatoula on the railroad taken by Yankees ; Camp Moore and three batteries, ditto. Not so cheering! If that is so, <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> lies within reach, being thirty-five miles off.

Leaving much the most valuable portion of our clothing here, the Yankees will probably appropriate what little they spared us and leave us fairly 
destitute; for we take only summer clothes to <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a>. I have plenty of underclothes, but the other 
day, when I unpacked the large trunk from Dr. Enders's, I found I had just two dresses for winter; 
a handsome blue silk I bought just two years ago 
last spring, and one heavy blue merino that does not 
fit me. What an outfit for winter! Miriam has two 
poplins and a black silk, and mother a wine-colored 
merino, only. But each of us is blessed with a warm 
cloak, and are correspondingly grateful. I was confident I had saved my green, dark blue, and brown 
silk dresses, but the Yankees saved them instead, 
for me, or their suffering sweethearts, rather. On 
the other hand, taking so many necessary articles 
to <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a>, the risk of losing them is the same. An 
attack on Port Hudson is apprehended, and if it 
falls, General Carter's house will be decidedly unsafe 
from Yankee vengeance. The probability is that 
it will burn, as they have been daily expecting ever 
since the Yankees occupied <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>. The risk 
seems equal, either way. Go or stay, the danger 
seems the same. Shall we go, then, for variety, or die 
here of stagnation while waiting for the Yankees to 
make up their minds? I would rather be at neither 
place, just now; in fact I could hardly name the 
place I should like to be in now, unless it were Europe 
or the Sandwich Islands; but I love <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> and 
its dear inhabitants, and under other circumstances 
should be only too happy to be there. I was regret 
ting the other day that our life was now so monotonous ; almost longed for the daily alarms we had when 
under Yankee rule in <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>. Stirring times are probably ahead.
