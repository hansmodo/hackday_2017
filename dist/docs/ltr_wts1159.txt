MAJOR E. M. SAWYER, 
</p><p>
A. A. C. Army of the Tenn., 
</p><p>
Huntsville, Alabama. 
</p><p>
Dear Sawyer : In my former letters I have answered 
all your questions save one, and that relates to the treatment of inhabitants known or suspected to be hostile or 
" Secesh." This is in truth the most difficult business 
of our army as it advances and occupies the Southern 
country. It is almost impossible to lay down rules, and 
I invariably leave the whole subject to the local commanders, but am willing W give them the benefit of my 
acquired knowledge and experience. In Europe, whence 
we derive our principles of war, wars are between kings 
or rulers through hired armies, and not between peoples. 
These remain, as it were, neutral, and sell their produce 
to whatever army is in possession. 
</p><p>
Napoleon when at war with Prussia, Austria, and 
Russia bought forage and provisions of the inhabitants, 
and consequently had an interest to protect the farms and 
factories which ministered to his wants. In like manner the Allied Armies in France could buy of the French 
habitants whatever they needed, the produce of the soil 
or manufactures of the country. Therefore, the general rule was and is that war is confined to the armies 
engaged, and should not visit the houses of families or 
private interests. But in other examples a different rule 
obtained the sanction of historical authority. I will 
only instance one, where in the siege 01 William and 
Mary the English army occupied Ireland, then in a state 
of revolt. The inhabitants were actually driven into 
foreign lands, and were dispossessed of their property 
and a new population introduced.

To this day a large part of the north of Ireland is 
held by the descendants of the Scotch emigrants sent 
there by William's order and an act of Parliament. The 
war which now prevails in our land is essentially a war 
of races. The Southern people entered into a clear compact of government with us of the North, but still maintained through state organizations a species of separate 
existence, with separate interests, history, and prejudices. These latter became stronger and stronger, till at 
last they have led to war and have developed fruits of 
the bitterest kind. We of the North are beyond all 
question right in our cause, but we are not bound to 
ignore the fact that the people of the South have prejudices which form a part of their nature, and which they 
cannot throw off without an effort of reason or the slower 
process of natural change. The question then arises, 
Should we treat as absolute enemies all in the South who 
differ from us in opinion or prejudice, kill or banish 
them, or should we give them time to think and gradually change their conduct so as to conform to the new 
order of things which is slowly and gradually creeping 
into their country ? 
</p><p>
When men take up arms to resist a rightful authority, 
we are compelled to use like force, because all reason 
and argument cease when arms are resorted to. When 
the provisions, forage, horses, mules, wagons, etc., are 
used by our enemy, it is clearly our duty and right to 
take them also, because otherwise they might be used 
against us. In like manner all houses left vacant by an 
inimical people are clearly our right, and as such are 
needed as storehouses, hospitals, and quarters. But the 
question arises as to dwellings used by women, children, 
and non-combatants. [ So long as non-combatants remain 
in their houses and keep to their accustomed peaceful 
business, their opinions and prejudices can in no wise 
influence the war, and therefore should not be noticed ; 
but if any one comes out into the public streets and creates disorder, he or she should be punished, restrained, 
or banished to the rear or front, as the officer in command adjudges^ If the people, or any of them, keep up 
a correspondence with parties in hostility, they are spies, 
and can be punished according to law with death or 
minor punishment. These are well-established principles of war, and this people of the South having appealed 
to war, are barred fVom appealing for protection to our 
constitution, which I they have practically and publicly 
defied. They have^ appealed to war, and must abide its 
rules and laws. . 
</p><p>
It is all idle nonsense for these Southern planters to 
say that they made the South, that they own it, and can 
do as they please to break up our Government and shut 
up the natural avenues of trade, intercourse, and commerce. We know, and they know, if they are intelligent 
beings, that as compared with the whole world they are 
but as five millions to one thousand millions, that they 
did not create the land, that the only title to use and usufruct is the deed of the United States, and that if they 
appeal to war they hold their all by a very insecure tenure. For my part, I believe that this war is the result of 
false political doctrine, for which we are all as a people 
more or less responsible, and I would give all a chance to 
reflect, and, when in error, to recant. I know the slaveowners, finding themselves in possession of a/species of 
property in opposition to the growing sentiinent of the 
whole civilized world, conceived their property to be in 
danger and foolishly appealed to war, and /chat by skilful 
political handling they involved with themselves the 
whole South on this result of error and prejudice. I believe that some of the rich and slave-holding are prejudiced to an extent that nothing but death and ruin will 
ever extinguish, but I hope that as the poorer and industrious classes of the South realize their relative weakness and their dependence upon the fruits of the earth 
and good-will of their fellow-men they will not only discover the error of their ways and repent of their hasty 
action, but bless those who persistently have maintained 
a constitutional government strong enough to sustain 
itself, protect its citizens, and promise peaceful homes to 
millions yet unborn. 
</p><p>
If the people of Huntsville think differently, let them 
persist in this war three years longer, and then they will 
not be consulted. 
</p><p>
Three years ago, by a little reflection and patience, they 
could have had a hundred years of peace and prosperity, 
but they preferred war. Last year they could have saved 
their slaves, but now it is top late, all the powers of 
earth cannot restore to them their slaves any more than 
their dead grandfathers. . . . 
</p><p>
A people who will persevere in war beyond a certain 
limit ought to know the consequences. Many, many 
people, with less pertinacity than the South has already 
shown, have been wiped out of national existence. 
</p><p>
My own belief is that even now the non-slave-holding 
classes of the South are alienating from their associates 
in war. Already I hear crimination and recrimination. 
Those who have property left should take warning in 
time. 
</p><p>
Since I have come down here I have seen many 
Southern planters, who now hire their own negroes and 
acknowledge that they were mistaken and knew not the 
earthquake they were to make by appealing to secession. 
They thought that the politicians had prepared the way, 
and that they could part the States of this Union in peace. 
They now see that we are bound together as one nation 
by indissoluble ties, and that any interest, or any fraction 
of the people that set themselves up in antagonism to 
the nation, must perish. 
</p><p>
Whilst I would not remit one jot or tittle of our nation's rights in peace or war, I do make allowances for 
past political errors and prejudices. 
</p><p>
Our national Congress and the Supreme Court are the 
proper arenas on which to discuss conflicting opinions, 
and nofthe battle-field. 
</p><p>
You may not hear from me again for some time, and if 
you think it will do any good, call some of the better 
people of Huntsville together and explain to them my 
views. You may even read to them this letter and let 
them use it, so as to prepare them for my coming. . . . 
</p><p>
We are progressing well in this quarter, but I have not 
changed my opinion that although we may soon make 
certain the existence of the power of our national government, yet years must pass before ruffianism, murder, 
and robbery will cease to afflict this region of our country. 
Your friend,
