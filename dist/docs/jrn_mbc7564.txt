<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='6'>6th</a>  [<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city origin'>CHARLESTON</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Davin! Have had a talk concerning him to-day with two opposite extremes of people. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Chesnut, my mother-in-law, praises everybody, good and bad. " Judge not," she says. She is a philosopher; she would not give herself the pain to find fault. The Judge abuses everybody, and he does it so well 
short, sharp, and incisive are his sentences, and he revels 
in condemning the world en Hoc, as the French say. So nobody is the better for her good word, or the worse for his bad one.

In Camden I found myself in a flurry of women. " Traitors," they cried. " Spies; they ought to be 
hanged ; Davin is taken up, Deaij and Davis are his accomplices." " What has Davin done? " "He ll be hanged, 
never you mind." " For what? " " They caught him walking on the trestle work in the swamp, after no good, 
you may be sure." " They won't hang him for that! " Hanging is too good for him ! : " You wait till Colonel Chesnut comes." " He is a lawyer," I said, gravely. 
" Ladies, he will disappoint you. There will be no lynching if he goes to that meeting to-day. He will not move a 
step except by habeas corpus and trial by jury, and a quantity of bench and bar to speak long speeches." 
</p><p>
Mr. Chesnut did come, and gave a more definite account of poor Davin's precarious situation. They had 
intercepted treasonable letters of his at the Post Office. I believe it was not a very black treason after all. At any 
rate, Mr. Chesnut spoke for him with might and main at the meeting. It was composed (the meeting) of intelligent 
men with cool heads. And they banished Davin to Fort Sumter. The poor Music Master can't do much harm in 
the casemates there. He may thank his stars that Mr. Chesnut gave him a helping hand. In the red hot state our 
public mind now is in there will be a short shrift for spies. Judge Withers said that Mr. Chesnut never made a more 
telling speech in his life than he did to save this poor Frenchman for whom Judge Lynch was ready. I had 
never heard of Davin in my life until I heard he was to be hanged.

Judge Stephen A. Douglas, the "little giant", is dead ; one of those killed by the war, no doubt ; trouble of mind.

Charleston people are thin-skinned. They shrink from Russell's touches. I find his criticisms mild. He has a 
light touch. I expected so much worse. Those Englishmen come, somebody says, with three P's pen, paper, prejudices. I dread some of those after-dinner stories. As to that day in the harbor, he let us off easily. He says our 
men are so fine looking. Who denies it? Not one of us. Also that it is a silly impression which has gone abroad 
that men can not work in this climate. We live in the open air, and work like Trojans at all manly sports, riding hard, 
hunting, playing at being soldiers. These fine, manly specimens have been in the habit of leaving the coast when it 
became too hot there, and also of fighting a duel or two, if kept long sweltering under a Charleston sun. Hand 
some youths, whose size and muscle he admired so much as they prowled around the Mills House, would not relish 
hard work in the fields between May and December. Negroes stand a tropical or semitropical sun at noon-day better than white men. In fighting it is different. Men will not then mind sun, or rain, or wind.

Major Emory, when he was ordered West, placed his resignation in the hands of his Maryland brothers. After 
the Baltimore row the brothers sent it in, but Maryland declined to secede. Mrs. Emory, who at least is two-thirds 
of that copartnership, being old Franklin's granddaughter, and true to her blood, tried to get it back. The President refused point blank, though she went on her knees. That I do not believe. The Franklin race are stiff-necked 
and stiff-kneed ; not much given to kneeling to God or man from all accounts.

If Major Emory comes to us won't he have a good time? <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> adores Mrs. Emory. No wonder I fell in 
love with her myself.. I heard of her before I saw her in this wise. Little Banks told me the story. She was dancing at a ball when some bad accident maker for the Evening News rushed up and informed her that Major Emory 
had been massacred by ten Indians somewhere out West. She coolly answered him that she had later intelligence; 
it was not so. Turning a deaf ear then, she went on dancing. Next night the same officious fool met her with 
this congratulation : "Oh, Mrs. Emory, it was all a hoax ! The Major is alive." She cried: " You are always running about with your bad news," and turned her back on him; or, I think it was, " You delight in spiteful stories," 
or, "You are a harbinger of evil". Banks is a newspaper man and knows how to arrange an anecdote for effect.
