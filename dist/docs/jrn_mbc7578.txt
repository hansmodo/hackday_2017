<a rel='month origin' value='7'>July</a> <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> telegraphed yesterday (they say, to <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>General Johnston</a>), " Come down and help us, or we 
shall be crushed by numbers. The President telegraphed <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>General Johnston</a> to move down to <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard's</a> aid. At 
Bull Run, Bonham's Brigade, Ewell's, and <a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel=''>Longstreet's</a> encountered the foe and repulsed him. Six hundred prisoners have been sent here.

I arose, as the Scriptures say, and washed my face and anointed my head and went down-stairs. At the 
foot of them stood General Cooper, radiant, one finger nervously arranging his shirt collar, or adjusting his neck to 
it after his fashion. He called out : "Your South Carolina man, Bonham, has done a capital thing at Bull Run driven back the enemy, if not defeated him; with killed and prisoners/ etc., etc. Clingman came to tell the particulars, 
and Colonel Smith (one of the trio with Garnett, <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan</a>, who were sent to Europe to inspect and report on mil 
itary matters). Poor Garnett is killed. There was cowardice or treachery on the part of natives up there, or 
some of Governor Letcher's appointments to military posts. I hear all these things said. I dp not understand, but it 
was a fatal business.

Mrs. McLane says she finds we do not believe a word of any news unless it comes in this guise: " A great battle 
fought. Not one Confederate killed. Enemy's loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners taken by us, immense." I 
was in hopes there would be no battle until Mr. Chesnut was forced to give up his amateur aideship to come and at 
tend to his regular duties in the Congress.

Keitt has come in. He says Bonham's battle was a skirmish of outposts. Joe Davis, Jr., said: " Would Heaven 
only send us a Napoleon! " Not one bit of use. If Heaven did, <a href='/results.php?tla=lew' rel=''>Walker</a> would not give him a commission. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> and Mrs. Joe Johnston, " her dear Lydia," were in fine spirits. The effect upon nous autres was evident; 
we rallied visibly. South Carolina troops pass every day. They go by with a gay step. Tom Taylor and John Rhett 
bowed to us from their horses as we leaned out of the win dows. Such shaking of handkerchiefs. We are forever at the windows. 
</p><p>
It was not such a mere skirmish. We took three rifled cannon and six hundred stands of arms. <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> has 
gone to Manassas. He did not let Wigfall know he was going. That ends the delusion of Wigfall's aideship. No 
mistake to-day. I was too ill to move out of my bed. So they all sat in my room.
