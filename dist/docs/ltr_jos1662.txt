Dear Brother : . . . The enlistment of recruits is now 
much more rapid than ever before. A regiment is organizing here and will be full in a few days. The new call 
for militia will also soon be filled up and I hope without 
a draft. Our people are beginning to feel a little more 
serious about the war, but the determination to wage it 
to a successful termination is stronger and firmer than 
ever. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a>'s misfortunes have allayed the political 
feeling that was gathering about him. His friends have 
much to say in his favor and his opponents are very 
moderate in condemning or criticising him. If you have 
time, write to me. For this month I will stay here as 
much as possible. In September I suppose I will be on 
the stump. After that I mean to remain as quiet as 
possible. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
