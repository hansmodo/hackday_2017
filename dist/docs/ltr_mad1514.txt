MY DEAR SIR, Your favour of the 15th, continued on the 
17th of December, came very slowly, but finally safe to hand. 
The warm expressions of regard which it contains are extremely 
flattering to me; and the more so as they so entirely correspond 
with my own wishes for everything which may enter into your 
happiness. 
</p><p>
You have not erred in supposing me out of the number of 
those who have relaxed their anxiety concerning the navigation 
of the Mississippi. If there be any who really look on the use 
of that river as an object not to be sought or desired by the 
United States, I cannot but think they frame their policy on 
both very narrow and very delusive foundations. It is true, if 
the States which are to be established on the waters of the Mississippi were to be viewed in the same relation to the Atlantic 
States as exists between the heterogeneous and hostile Societies 
of Europe, it might not appear strange that a distinction, or 
even an opposition of interests, should be set up. But is it 
true that they can be viewed in such a relation? Will the settlements which are beginning to take place on the branches of 
the Mississippi be so many distinct societies, or only an expansion of the same society ? So many new bodies, or merely the 
growth of the old one ? Will they consist of a hostile or a foreign people, or will they not be bone of our bone and flesh of 
our flesh ? Besides the confederal band within which they will 
be comprehended, how much will the connection be strengthened by the ties of friendship, of marriage, and consanguinity ? 
ties which, it may be remarked, will be even more numerous 
between the ultramontane and the Atlantic States than between 
any two of the latter. But viewing this subject through the 
medium least favorable to my ideas, it still presents to the 
United States sufficient inducements to insist on the navigation 
of the Mississippi. Upon this navigation depends essentially 
the value of that vast field of territory which is to be sold for 
the benefit of the common Treasury; and upon the value of this 
territory, when settled, will depend the portion of the public 
burdens of which the old States will be relieved by the new. 
Add to this the stake which a considerable proportion of those 
who remain in the old States will acquire in the new by adventures in land, either on their own immediate account or that of 
their descendants. 
</p><p>
Nature has given the use of the Mississippi to those who may 
settle on its waters, as she gave to the United States their 
independence. The impolicy of Spain may retard the former, 
as that of Great Britain did the latter. But as Great Britain 
could not defeat the latter, neither will Spain the former. Nature seems on all sides to be reasserv.ng those rights which have 
so long been trampled on by tyranny and bigotry. Philosophy 
and Commerce are the auxiliaries to whom she is indebted for 
her triumphs. Will it be presumptuous to say, that those nations will shew most wisdom, as well as acquire most glory, 
who, instead of forcing her current into artificial channels, endeavour to ascertain its tendency and to anticipate its effects? 
If the United States were to become parties to the occlusion of 
the Mississippi, they would be guilty of treason against the 
very laws under which they obtained and hold their national 
existence. 
</p><p>
The repugnance of Spain to an amicable regulation of the 
use of the Mississippi is the natural offspring of a system which 
everybody but herself has long seen to be as destructive to her 
interest as it is dishonorable to her character. An extensive 
deserv.seems to have greater charms in her eye than a flourishing but limited empire; nay, than an extensive, flourishing empire. Humanity cannot suppress the wish that some of those 
gifts which she abuses were placed by just means in hands that 
would turn them to a wiserv.ccount. What a metamorphosis 
would the liberal policy of France work in a little time on the 
Island of New Orleans? It would to her be a fund of as much 
real wealth as Potosi has been of imaginary wealth to Spain. 
It would become the Grand Cairo of the new World. 
</p><p>
The folly of Spain is not less displayed in the means she employs than in the ends she prefers. She is afraid of the growth 
and neighbourhood of the United States, because it may endanger the tranquility of her American possessions; and to obviate 
this danger she proposes to shut up the Mississippi. If her 
prudence bore any proportion to her jealousy, she would see 
that if the experiment were to succeed it would only double 
the power of the United States to disturb her, at the same time 
that it provoked a disposition to exert it; she would see that 
the only offensive weapon which can render the United States 
truly formidable to her is a navy, and that if she could keep their 
inhabitants from crossing the Appalachian ridge, she would only 
drive to the Sea most of those swarms which would otherwise 
direct their course to the Western Wilderness. She should reflect, too, that as it is impossible for her to destroy the power 
which she dreads, she ought only to consult the means of preventing a future exertion of it. What are those means? Two, 
and two only. The first is a speedy concurrence in such a 
treaty with the United States as will produce a harmony, and 
remove all pretexts for interrupting it. The second, which 
would in fact result from the first, consists in favouring the extension of their settlements. As these become extended, the 
members of the Confederacy must be multiplied, and along with 
them the wills which are to direct the machine. And as the 
wills multiply, so will the chances against a dangerous union 
of them. We experience every day the difficulty of drawing 
thirteen States into the same plans. Let the number be doubled, 
and so will the difficulty. In the multitude of our Counsellors, 
Spain may be told, lies her safety. 
</p><p>
If the temper of Spain be unfriendly to the views of the United States, they may certainly calculate on the favorable sentiments of the other powers of Europe, at least of all such of them 
as favored our Independence. The chief advantages expected 
in Europe from that event center in the revolution it was to 
produce in the commerce between the new and the old World. 
The commerce of the United States is advantageous to Europe 
in two respects: first, by the unmanufactured produce which 
they export; secondly, by the manufactured imports which they 
consume. Shut up the Mississippi and discourage the settlements on its waters, and what will be the consequence? First, a 
greater quantity of subsistence must be raised within the ancient 
settlements, the culture of tobacco, indigo, and other articles for 
exportation, be proportionably diminished, and their price proportionably raised on the European consumer. Secondly, the 
hands without land at home being discouraged from seeking it 
where alone it could be found, must be turned in a great degree 
to manufacturing, our imports proportionably diminished, and a 
proportional loss fall on the European manufacturer. Establish 
the freedom of the Mississippi, and let our emigrations have free 
course, and how favorably for Europe will the consequence be 
reversed? First, the culture of every article for exportation 
will be extended, and the price reduced in favor of her consumers. Secondly, our people will increase without an increase 
of our manufacturers, and in the same proportion will be increased the employment and profit of hers. 
</p><p>
These consequences would affect France, in common with the 
other commercial nations of Europe; but there are additional 
motives which promise the United States her friendly wishes and 
offices. Not to dwell on the philanthropy which reigns in the 
heart of her Monarch, and which has already adorned his head 
with a crown of laurels, he cannot be inattentive to the situation into which a controversy between his antient and new 
allies would throw him, nor to the use which would be made 
of it by his watchful adversary. Will not all his councils, then, 
be employed to prevent this controversy; will it not be seen, as 
the pretensions of the parties directly interfere, it can be prevented only by a dissuasive interposition on one side or the 
other; that on the side of the United States such an interposition must, from the nature of things, be unavailing; or if their 
pretensions for a moment be lulled, they would but awake with 
fresh energy, and, consequently, that the mediating influence of 
France ought to be turned wholly on the side of Spain ? The 
influence of the French Court over that of Spain is known to 
be great. In America it is supposed to be greater than perhaps it really is. The same may be said of the intimacy of the 
Union between the two nations. If this influence should not 
be exerted^ this intimacy may appear to be the cause. The 
United States consider Spain as the only favorite of their Ally 
of whom they have ground to be jealous; and whilst France 
continues to hold the first place in their affections, they must at 
least be mortified at any appearance that the predilection may 
not be reciprocal. 
</p><p>
The Mississippi has drawn me into such length, that I fear 
you will have little patience left for anything else. I will spare 
it as much as possible. I hear nothing from Congress except 
that Mr. Jay has accepted his appointment, and that no successor 
has yet been chosen to Doctor Franklin. Our Legislature made 
a decent provision for remittances due for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1785">1785</a> from Virginia 
to the Treasury of the United States, and very extensive provision for opening our inland navigation. They have passed 
an act vesting in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> a considerable interest 
in each of the works on James River and Potowmac, but with 
an honorary rather than lucrative aspect. Whether he will 
accept it or not I cannot say. I meant to have sent you a copy 
of the Act, but have been disappointed in getting one from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>. They also passed an act for reforming our juridical 
System, which promises salutary effects; and did not pass the 
act for the corrupting our Religious system. Whether they 
passed an act for paying British debts or not they do not know 
themselves. Before the bill for that purpose had got through 
the last usual forms, the want of members broke up the House. 
It remains, therefore, in a situation which has no precedent, and 
without a precedent lawyers and legislators are as much at a 
loss as a mariner without his compass. 
</p><p>
The subjects in which you interested yourself were all referred to the Executive with power to do, what I hope they 
will do better than the Assembly. I understood before I left 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> that you would receive officially from the Governor 
a copy of the Resolutions which I sent you. I received a letter 
a few days ago from Mr. Mercer, written in the bosom of wedlock at Mr. Sprigg's; another at the same time from Monroe, 
who was well at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. I have nothing to say of myself 
but that I have exchanged <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>, as you will 
have seen by the above date; that I enjoy a satisfactory share 
of health; that I spend the chief of my time in reading, and the 
chief of my reading, on Law; that I shall hear with the greatest pleasure of your being far better employed; and that I am, 
with most affectionate esteem, your obt friend and serv.
