<p>
PROCLAMATION TO THE CITIZENS OF PADUCAH!
</p><p>
I have come among you, not as an enemy, but as your friend and
fellow-citizen, not to injure or annoy you, but to respect the rights,
and to defend and enforce the rights of all loyal citizens. An enemy,
in rebellion against our common Government, has taken possession of,
and planted its guns upon the soil of Kentucky and fired upon our flag.
Hickman and Columbus are in his hands. He is moving upon your city. I
am here to defend you against this enemy and to assert and maintain the
authority and sovereignty of your Government and mine. I have nothing
to do with opinions. I shall deal only with armed rebellion and its
aiders and abettors.
</p><p>
You can pursue your usual avocations without fear or hindrance. The
strong arm of the Government is here to protect its friends, and to
punish only its enemies. Whenever it is manifest that you are able to
defend yourselves, to maintain the authority of your Government, and
protect the rights of all its loyal citizens, I shall withdraw the
forces under my command from your city.

U.S. GRANT,<br>
 Brig-Gen. U.S.A., Commanding.
