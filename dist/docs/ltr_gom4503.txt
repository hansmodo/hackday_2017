Dear Madam, 
</p><p>
It is with inexpressible concern, that I am this day informed of the death of my sister. We all sustain in her a great 
loss, but you in particular, who are thus bereft of the companion of your age, must feel it most severely. Would to God it 
were in my power to alleviate the pangs of a sorrowing parent. 
But this is not my lot. My friend Wilkins will, I am sure, on 
this occasion do the duties of a child and a friend. There is 
one comforter, who weighs our minutes, and numbers out our 
days. It is He, who has inflicted upon us the weight of public and private calamities, and He best knows when to remove the burthen. I am sorry it is not in my power to see 
you at present. I know it is your wish, that I were removed 
from public affairs ; indeed, as far as relates to my own ease 
and enjoyments, I wish so too. But I know it is the duty of 
every good citizen or man to preserve that post, in which by a 
superior order he is placed. Where the happiness of a considerable part of our fellow creatures is deeply concerned, we 
soon feel the insignificancy of an individual. And whatever lot 
that individual shall experience, while a conscious rectitude of 
conduct inspires and supports him, though he may be unfortunate, he cannot be miserable. 
</p><p>
What may be the event of the present war, it is not in man 
to determine. Great revolutions of empire are seldom achieved without much human calamity ; but the worst, which can 
happen, is to fall on the last bleak mountain of America, and he who dies there, in defence of the injured rights of mankind, 
is happier than his conqueror, more beloved by mankind, more applauded by his own heart. 
</p><p>
The death of my sister has incapacitated me for mirth ; my 
letter, therefore, is of an improper complexion to one already 
afflicted. My love to my sisters, to Wilkins, whose integrity 
I love and respect, to the good natured Counsellor of Bermuda, and such others as deserve it. The number is not great. 
</p><p>
Pray believe me most sincerely your affectionate son.
