Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I was favoured with yours of the 28th ultimo as I was 
preparing to go out of town. It was not until last evening 
that I returned, or I should have taken an earlier opportunity of answering your letter. 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks tor your friendly congratulations. I 
believe them sincere, and value them accordingly. It would 
give me great pleasure to see your situation more comfortable. On these occasions it is best to be very explicit ; it 
would neither be friendly nor candid to excite delusory 
expectations, or to make promises without a good prospect 
of performing them. There is not a single office in my 
gift ; nor do I recollect that there is more than one in the 
appointment of the court, I mean their clerk. As to offices 
in the gift of other departments, I think it my duty not to 
interfere, nor to ask favours, it being improper for a judge 
to put himself under such obligations. 
</p><p>
I am sincerely disposed to serve my friends, and you 
among others ; but it can only be in a way perfectly consistent with the duties and proprieties of my public station. 
These considerations will, I am persuaded, have their due 
weight with you, and rather increase than diminish the 
esteem and attachment you have always expressed and 
manifested for me. I regret that on this occasion I cannot say things more consonant with your wishes ; but 
sincerity, though not always pleasing, is preferable to mere 
civility. 
</p><p>
Be assured of my constant regard, and that I remain 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
