<p><i>[Biographer's note:
My mother had quite recently rented a house on Clay Street in Richmond
which, though small, gave her a roof of her own, and it also enabled
her at times to entertain some of her many friends.  Of this new home,
and of a visit of a soldier's wife to him, the General thus writes:]</i></p><p>

I received yesterday, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>, your letter of the 29th, and am
very glad to learn that you find your new abode so comfortable and
so well arranged.  The only fault I find in it is that it is not large
enough for you all, and that Charlotte, whom I fear requires much
attention, is by herself.  Where is 'Life' to go, too, for I suppose
she is a very big personage?  But you have never told me where it is
situated, or how I am to direct to you.  Perhaps that may be the cause
of delay in my letters.  I am sorry you find such difficulty in
procuring yarn for socks, etc.  I fear my daughters have not taken to
the spinning-wheel and loom, as I have recommended.  I shall not be
able to recommend them to the brave soldiers for wives.  I had a visit
from a soldier's wife to-day, who was on a visit with her husband.
She was from Abbeville district, S. C.  Said she had not seen her
husband for more than two years, and, as he had written to her for
clothes, she herself thought she would bring them on.  It was the first
time she had travelled by railroad, but she got along very well by
herself.  She brought an entire suit of her own manufacture for her
husband.  She spun the yarn and made the clothes herself.  She clad
her three young children in the same way, and had on a beautiful pair
of gloves she had made for herself.  Her children she had left with
her sister.  She said she had been here a week and must return
to-morrow, and thought she could not go back without seeing me.  Her
husband accompanied her to my tent, in his nice gray suit.  She was
very pleasing in her address and modest in her manner, and was clad
in a nice, new alpaca.  I am certain she could not have made that.
Ask Misses Agnes and Sally Warwick what they think of that.  They need
not ask me for permission to get married until they can do likewise.
She, in fact, was an admirable woman.  Said she was willing to give
up everything she had in the world to attain our independence, and
the only complaint she made of the conduct of our enemies was their
arming our servants against us.  Her greatest difficulty was to procure
shoes.  She made them for herself and children of cloth with leather
soles.  She sat with me about ten minutes and took her leave--another
mark of sense--and made no request for herself or husband.  I wrote
you about my wants in my former letter.  My rheumatism I hope is a
little better, but I have had to-day, and indeed always have, much
pain.  I trust it will pass away....  I have just had a visit from
my nephews, Fitz, John, and Henry [General Fitz Lee, and his two
brothers, Major John Mason Lee and Captain Henry Carter Lee].  The
former is now on a little expedition.  The latter accompanies him.
As soon as I was left alone, I committed them in a fervent prayer to
the care and guidance of our Heavenly Father....  I pray you may be
made whole and happy.

                       Truly and devotedly yours,
