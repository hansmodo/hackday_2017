SIR, 
</p><p>
As I imagine this will meet you on the road to 
this place, I waive making any mention of public 
matters, except that it is the wish of Congress you 
would, if consistent with the good of the service, 
order one battalion from. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to be posted at 
Aniboy, in the Jerseys, agreeably to the inclosed resolve. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> arrived this morning; soon after 
which I was honored with your favor by post, which 
I laid before Congress; and, as they expect you so 
soon here, I imagine they will defer consulting <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a>, and wait your arrival. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 20th instant I received this 
morning, and cannot help expressing the very great 
pleasure it would afford both Mrs. Hancock and my 
self to have the happiness of accommodating you 
during your stay in this city. As the house I live 
in is large and roomy, it will be entirely in your 
power to live in that manner you should wish. 
Mrs. Washington may be as retired as she pleases 
while under inoculation, and Mrs. Hancock will esteem it an honor to have Mrs. Washington inoculated in her house ; and, as I am informed Mr. Randolph has not any lady about his house to take the 
necessary care of Mrs. Washington, I flatter myself 
she will be as well attended in my family. In 
short, Sir, I must take the freedom to repeat my 
wish, that you would be pleased to condescend to 
dwell under my roof. I assure you, Sir, I will do 
all in my power to render your stay agreeable, and 
my house shall be entirely at your disposal. I must, 
however, submit this to your determination, and only 
add that you will peculiarly gratify Mrs. Hancock and 
myself in affording me an opportunity of convincing 
you of this truth, that I am, with every sentiment 
of regard for you and your connections, and with 
much esteem, dear Sir, your faithful and most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. Fessenden is complaining for the want of 
money; I have advanced him sixteen dollars, which 
you will please to order him to account for.
