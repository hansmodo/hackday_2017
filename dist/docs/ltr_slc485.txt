CHICAGO, Nov. 12, '79.

Livy darling, it was a great time.  There were perhaps thirty people on
the stage of the theatre, and I think I never sat elbow-to-elbow with so
many historic names before.  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="met">Sherman</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=phs" rel="met">Sheridan</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jms" rel="met">Schofield</a>, Pope,
Logan, Augur, and so on.  What an iron man Grant is!  He sat facing the
house, with his right leg crossed over his left and his right boot-sole
tilted up at an angle, and his left hand and arm reposing on the arm of
his chair--you note that position?  Well, when glowing references were
made to other grandees on the stage, those grandees always showed a
trifle of nervous consciousness--and as these references came frequently,
the nervous change of position and attitude were also frequent.  But
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a>!--he was under a tremendous and ceaseless bombardment of praise and
gratulation, but as true as I'm sitting here he never moved a muscle of
his body for a single instant, during 30 minutes!  You could have played
him on a stranger for an effigy.  Perhaps he never would have moved, but
at last a speaker made such a particularly ripping and blood-stirring
remark about him that the audience rose and roared and yelled and stamped
and clapped an entire minute--<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> sitting as serene as ever--when Gen.
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="met">Sherman</a> stepped to him, laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder,
bent respectfully down and whispered in his ear.  Gen. Grant got up and
bowed, and the storm of applause swelled into a hurricane.  He sat down,
took about the same position and froze to it till by and by there was
another of those deafening and protracted roars, when Sherman made him
get up and bow again.  He broke up his attitude once more--the extent of
something more than a hair's breadth--to indicate me to Sherman when the
house was keeping up a determined and persistent call for me, and poor
bewildered Sherman, (who did not know me), was peering abroad over the
packed audience for me, not knowing I was only three feet from him and
most conspicuously located, (Gen. Sherman was Chairman.)
</p><p>
One of the most illustrious individuals on that stage was "Ole Abe," the
historic war eagle.  He stood on his perch--the old savage-eyed rascal
--three or four feet behind <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="met">Gen. Sherman</a>, and as he had been in nearly
every battle that was mentioned by the orators his soul was probably
stirred pretty often, though he was too proud to let on.
</p><p>
Read Logan's bosh, and try to imagine a burly and magnificent Indian, in
General's uniform, striking a heroic attitude and getting that stuff off
in the style of a declaiming school-boy.

Please put the enclosed scraps in the drawer and I will scrap-book them.

I only staid at the Owl Club till 3 this morning and drank little or
nothing.  Went to sleep without whisky.  Ich liebe dish.
