DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your Excellency's directions, I have 
consulted some of the General Officers who I thought 
most capable of advising upon the proper steps to 
take in our present circumstances. They say that 
they can by no means advise for or against an attack. 
They are fully convinced that General Howe has his 
whole force with him ; that, if your Excellency thinks 
your force sufficient to cope with his, they are willing to risk their lives and fortunes with you in the 
attempt. They say, further, that General Howe is 
possessed of very strong grounds at present, and, even 
if he was not, he would have sufficient time to post 
himself strongly before you could reach him, as your army must have a march of two days before they 
could come to action. They think if an attack is 
made on his left with success, he can retreat with 
ease ; if on his right, he must be ruined ; but, should 
you fail in the latter, your army must be pushed into 
the Schuylkill. 
</p><p>
They, upon the whole, think that the attempt will 
be exceeding hardous, and the success doubtful ; 
that, if you fail, the people who are now so fond of 
censuring, will change their clamor, and censure you 
for not attacking him when he was within a mile 
of you, and your army more numerous and in better 
condition than at present. They say they are free for attacking him, if he, by his advances this way, 
shows an intention of attacking us ; but cannot ad 
vise to marching the army to attack him where he 
now is, unless your Excellency is fully convinced of 
your superiority in numbers. 
</p><p>
These are the sentiments of the gentlemen whom I 
have consulted, and, though I think they have much 
weight, I am so weary of the infernal clamor of the 
Pennsylvanians, that I am for satisfying them at all 
events, and risking every consequence in an action. 
Possibly we may be successful; if not, they may be 
satisfied, and even Congress itself may gain experience, and learn to censure with more caution. Possibly a defeat may have this good effect, and a victory will bring with it its own reward. I am, there 
fore, clearly for risking every consequence in an action, and, among others, most cheerfully, the life and 
fortune of 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant.
