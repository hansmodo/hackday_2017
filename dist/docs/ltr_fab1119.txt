We are now where we ought to have the Southeast trades but the wind ever since we left has been east and N.E., so the idea that people have that the trade winds always blow in one direction is all exploded. The weather is cooler than at Tahiti but still comfortable. I like a warm climate and never have longed for those down-East winters since I left home.

I wish I could send you a basket of fruit. Bananas are my favorite. Fried bananas are our standing dish for breakfast but tell Mr. Trott that his hopeful son, Joseph, our cook, is a perfect ass. He doesn't know how to burn coffee, but he does know enough when he kills a pig to steal the liver and fry it for his own tooth. While I think of it, give my compliments to Joseph Buck and tell him that I think the Columbia a beautiful Schooner. She is a fine sea boat and sails first-rate, makes 140 miles a day, close hauled on the wind and if she will only beat the Jane Hersey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> I shall win a dinner at the Jackson House.
