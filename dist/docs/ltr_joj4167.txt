Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received by the last mail, and have read with great 
pleasure, your obliging letter of the 1 1th inst. The information it conveys cannot fail of being grateful to all who prefer 
the wise and upright policy which distinguished the administration of Washington, to that which of late has distressed 
and disgraced our country. How fir the favourable changes 
which have taken place are imputable to patriotic and correct principles, time and experience only can decide. Sincerely do I wish that all our elections may manifest the 
prevalence of such principles ; but I am not sanguine in my 
expectations of it. Personal and pecuniary considerations 
appear to have acquired a more than ordinary degree of 
influence. Many sacrifices of public good have, and will 
yet be made to them. On the exertions of the virtuous and 
intelligent much will always depend ; should they become 
relaxed, by a sense either of security or of fatigue, we shall 
probably lose the ground we have gained. I brought with 
me into retirement the same affection for our country by 
which I have always been actuated, and you rightly judge 
that nothing which is of importance to the public can be a 
matter of indifference to me. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
With sincere esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
