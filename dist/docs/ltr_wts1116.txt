Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I know full well the force of what you say. At a 
moment like this the country expects every man to do 
his duty. But every man is not at liberty to do as he 
pleases. You know that Mr. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Lincoln</a> said to you and 
me that he did not think he wanted military men. I 
was then free, uncommitted. ... I approve fully of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Lincoln's</a> determination to use all his ordinary and extraordinary powers to maintain and defend the authority 
with which he is clothed and the integrity of the nation, 
and had I not committed myself to another duty, I would 
most willingly have responded to his call. 
</p><p>
The question of the national integrity and slavery 
should be kept distinct, for otherwise it will gradually 
become a war of extermination, a war without end. 
If, when Congress meets, a clearly defined policy be 
arrived at, a clear end to be accomplished, and then the 
force adequate to that end be provided for, then I could 
and would act with some degree of confidence, not now. 
</p><p>
I take it for granted that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> is safe; that 
Pickeiis can beat off all assailants ; that Key West and 
Tortugas are strong and able to spare troops for other 
purposes; that, above all, Fort Monroe is full of men, 
provisions, and warlike materials, and that the Chesa
Ipeake is strongly occupied. Then the first thing will be 
the avenues of travel. Baltimore must be made to allow 
the free transit of troops, provisions, and materials without question, and the route from Wheeling to the Relay 
House kept open. Here there must be some fighting, 
but a march from Brownsville to Frostburg would be a 
good drill, via Hagerstown, Frederick, and the Potomac. 
From present information I apprehend that Virginia 
will destroy the road from Harper's Ferry west, and 
maybe the Marylanders will try the balance ; but, without an hour's delay, that line should swarm with troops, 
who should take no half-way measures. 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
