Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Colonel Stewart Commissary-General of Issues, has 
made a demand on the Commissary at this post for 
thirty hogsheads of rum. As there are only fifty odd 
in the magazine, I have desired him to send only 
fifteen, which will be a present supply for the army; 
the remainder will he necessary for the use of the 
garrison. The Commissary informs me that he expects no more ; and as large supplies are coming on 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I think the army cannot want. 
</p><p>
I wish your Excellency would be kind enough to 
order Mr. Erskine to send me a map of the country 
from this place to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, particularly on the east 
side of the river, which would be very useful to me. 
The ofiicers in general, from the State of Massachusett's Bay, have never been in the service before, and 
are extremely ignorant of their duty, which throws 
every thing into confusion ; and, in case of an attack 
on the post, from their inexperience I believe little 
dependence can be placed on them. The troops are 
good, and well armed. Would it not be better. Sir, 
to continue a part or the whole of the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
brigade at this post, whose ofiicers (particularly Colonel Malcom) are well acquainted with the duty, and 
can be depended on, and the troops have, in general, 
bad arms and few bayonets ? 
</p><p>
I am convinced, that the Massachusetts or Hampshire troops will be better in the field, from this circumstance in their arms. 
</p><p>
Major Villefranche has surveyed the works at West 
Point, and informs me that there is a vast deal to do to complete them ; that large quantities of materials, 
such as timber, plank, boards, stone, &c., -will be wanted. Part of the materials are at different places near 
this post ; but I do not find that there are any teams 
or forage in the department, and, at present there is 
no prospect of any being furnished. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to trouble your Excellency with so 
long a list of grievances; and am, very respectfully, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and obliged humble servant, 
</p><p>
