<p><i>[Biographers Note:When the Confederate government moved from Montgomery to Richmond,
and President Davis took charge of all military movements, my father
was kept near him as his constant and trusted adviser.  His experience
as an engineer was of great service to the young Confederacy, and he
was called upon often for advice for the location of batteries and
troops on our different defensive lines.  In a letter to my mother
he speaks of one of these trips to the waters east of Richmond.]</i>

...I have just returned from a visit to the batteries and troops on
James and York rivers, etc., where I was some days.  I called a few
hours at the White House.  Saw Charlotte and Annie.  Fitzhugh was
away, but got out of the cars as I got in.  Our little boy looked
very sweet and seemed glad to kiss me good-bye.  Charlotte said she
was going to prepare to leave for the summer, but had not determined
where to go.  I could only see some of the servants about the house
and the stables.  They were all well....  You may be aware that the
Confederate Government is established here.  Yesterday I turned over
to it the command of the military and naval forces of the State, in
accordance with the proclamation of the Government and the agreement
between the State and the Confederate States.  I do not know what my
position will be.  I should like to retire to private life, if I
could be with you and the children, but if I can be of any service
to the State or her cause I must continue.  Mr. Davis and all his
Cabinet are here....  Good-bye.  Give much love to kind friends.
May God guard and bless you, them, and our suffering country, and
enable me to perform my duty.  I think of you constantly.  Write me
what you will do.  Direct here.
