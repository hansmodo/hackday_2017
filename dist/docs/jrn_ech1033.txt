I have been too tired to give the proceedings of the day, and this evening the case is not much better. Monday I went up to where Cox's boys were at work and saw them take out a little gold dust. Then I went down the creek to look at my lot, and fell in with an old man by the name of Smith, of Michigan, who was formerly a cattle drover, well acquainted with and a warm friend of General Cass. He wanted a hand to work for him. We soon struck a bargain and I was to try how all things suit, at four dollars per day and found. Tuesday morning I arose early, prepared breakfast and partook thereof heartily, and then proceeded to the theatre of work, but I waited a considerable time before my employer made his appearance. When he came, we went to work, digging, carrying dirt, and washing pretty steadily, until near twelve o'clock when he had to go and prepare dinner for himself and me, it being in the contract for him to board me. In half an hour he called me to dinner, consisting of a cup of coffee strong enough to float a millstone, two small pieces of fat pork, fried and burned and a pancake apiece, made of flour and water, fried in pork fat, and about as heavy as its size in lead. After a pretty good rest we again went to work and continued until about an hour before sunset, when we stopped. He wanted me to come on the next day and I told him I would rather board myself and he agreed to give me five dollars per day and I find myself. We were in the water part of the time up to our knees, and washed out fourteen dollars.

On Wednesday we washed out some sand and found about three dollars. Mr. Smith then told me he was too poor to hire help any longer and proposed I should join him in partnership to work out a large hole. To this I consented and expect to go to work at it in a few days. Yesterday I went to work on the quartz diggings for a gentleman at five dollars per day. The work was very hard, and I never did a day's work in my life that tired me as much.
<p></p>
This morning I felt too tired and sore to undergo another day's work like yesterday and hence I concluded to rest. I did my washing and bought a few pounds of beef and potatoes. The latter were for Atkins, who is worse again, and the doctor now has him under a strict course of dieting.

The weather is growing oppressively hot and today a blue smoke like our Indian summer is spread around everything, while the sun would be melting us, did not a cool and gentle breeze from the northwest purify and cool the heated air.
