Dear General, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, the Indians killed two men, of the frontier inhabitants, on Robeson's Run, in this county 
(Yougliiogania), and fired at two soldiers who were 
taking some stores in a canoe from hence to Fort 
Henry. One of them is wounded, but neither of 
them fell into the hands of the enemy. I would have 
sent a party to pursue the Indians, but I have no 
provisions left, nor do I see any prospect of an adequate supply, as the drought still continues, and we 
have neither money nor credit to make purchases. 
</p><p>
Colonel Clark has lately destroyed two of the Shawanese towns, and Idlled six men and one woman, 
and is returned to the Falls. If a sufficient quantity 
of provisions can be obtained, I will yet visit the 
Wyandots by the 1st of November; and I believe 
the country will be unanimous in joining me upon 
an expedition. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c. &c., 
</p><p>
