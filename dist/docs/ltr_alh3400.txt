DEAR EDWARD, 
</p><p>
This serves to acknowledge the receipt of yours per Capt. Lowndes, which was delivered me yesterday. The 
truth of Capt. Lightbowen and Lowndes' information is now verified by the presence of your father and sister, for whose 
safe arrival I pray, and that they may convey that satisfaction to your soul, that must naturally flow from the sight of 
absent friends in health ; and shall for news this way, refer you to them. 
</p><p>
As to what you say, respecting your soon having the happiness of seeing us all, I wish for an accomplishment of 
your hopes, provided they are concomitant with your welfare, otherwise not ; though doubt whether I shall be present or not, for to confess my weakness, Ned, my ambition is prevalent, so that I contemn the grovelling condition of 
a clerk, or the like, to which my fortune condemns me, and would willingly risk my life, though not my character, to exalt my station. I am confident, Ned, that my youth excludes me from any hopes of immediate preferment, nor do I desire it ; but I mean to prepare the way 
for futurity. I'm no philosopher, you see, and may be justly said to build castles in the air ; my folly makes me ashamed, 
and beg you'll conceal it ; yet, Neddy, we have seen such schemes successful, when the projector is constant. I shall conclude by saying, I wish there was a war. 
</p><p>
I am, 
</p><p>
Dear Edward,
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">ALEX. HAMILTON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I this moment received yours by William Smith, 
and pleased to see you give such close application to study. 
Addressed to " Edward Stevens, in New-York"
