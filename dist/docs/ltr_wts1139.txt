Dear Brother : I did not expect you would come if the 
confederates got possession of Kentucky. Even on the 
Mississippi the boats are fired on daily. I have been 
compelled to burn down one town and resort to retaliation. I understand Prentiss has ordered back from Helena 
a part of the forces towards <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>, on the ground that 
the confederates are again advancing on Missouri. I 
rather think you now agree with me that this is no common war, that it was not going to end in a few months 
or a few years. For after eighteen months' war the 
enemy is actually united, armed, and determined, with 
powerful forces well handled, disciplined and commanded 
on the Potomac, the Ohio, the Missouri. You must now 
see that I was right in not seeking prominence at the 
outstart. I knew and know yet that the northern people have to unlearn all their experience of the past 
thirty years and be born again before they will see the 
truth. . . . 
</p><p>
The South has united people and as many men as she 
can arm, and though our armies pass across and through 
the land, the war closes in behind and leaves the same 
enemy behind. We attempt to occupy places, and the people rise up and make the detachments prisoners. I know 
you all recognize in these facts simply that Mason is a 
coward, Ford an ass, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> slow, Buell over-cautious, 
and "Wright timid. This may all be so, but the causes 
lie deeper. Everybody thought I exaggerated the dangers, so I have no right to an opinion, but I rather think 
many now see the character of the war in which we are 
engaged. I don't see the end or the beginning of the 
end, but suppose we must prevail and persist or perish. 
I don't believe that two nations can exist within our old 
limits, and therefore that war is on us and we must 
fight it out. . . . 
</p><p>
When anybody tells you that I ever doubted your 
honesty and patriotism, tell him he says false. I may 
have said you were a politician and that we differed 
widely in the origin of this war, but that being in it, we 
fully agreed that it must be fought out. But you have 
more faith than I in the people. They are not infallible. 
People may err as much as men, as individuals and 
whole communities may err. Can the people of the 
North be right and the South too ? One of the peoples 
must be wrong. . . . 
</p><p>
Your brother,
