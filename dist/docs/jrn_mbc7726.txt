that William Kirkland has been wounded. A scene occurred then, Mary weeping bitterly and Aunt B. frantic as 
to Tanny's danger. I proposed to make arrangements for Mary to go on at once. The Judge took me aside, frowning

I told him of the woman who, when the conductor said she could not go, cried at the top of her voice, " Soldiers, I want to go to Richmond to nurse my wounded husband." In a moment twenty men made themselves her

Mary Ford writes for school-books for her boys. She is in great distress on the subject. When Long-street's corps 
passed through Greenville there was great enthusiasm; handkerchiefs were waved, bouquets and flowers were 
thrown the troops ; her boys, having nothing else to throw, threw their school-books.
