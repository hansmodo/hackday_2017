Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The present conveyance is sudden and unexpected. I have only time, therefore, to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 29th ultimo, and to assure you, that I felt a most sensible pleasure when I heard of 
your acceptance of the late appointment of Congress to regulate the finances of this country. My hand and heart shall Ix- with you; and, as far as my assistance can go, coinnianil il. We have, I am persuaded, but 
one object in view, the public good ; to effect which, I will aid your endeavours to the extent of my abilities, and with all the powers I am vested with. I 
shall be happy in meeting you, and would have written to you more fully at this time, if the bearer was not wailing. I could not, however, refrain from embracing 
the first opportunity that offered, of expressing the pleasure I felt at hearing from yourself, that you had entered upon the duties of your office, and to assure 
you with how much truth and sincerity, I am, &c. 
</p>
