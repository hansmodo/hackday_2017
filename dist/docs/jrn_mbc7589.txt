<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='16'>16th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Mr. Barnwell says, Fame is an article 
usually home made ; you must create your own puffs or superintend their manufacture. And you must see that the 
newspapers print your own military reports. No one else will give you half the credit you take to yourself. No one 
will look after your fine name before the world with the loving interest and faith you have yourself.
