MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
YOUR dearest friend never had a more trying day 
than yesterday. A solemn scene it was indeed, and 
it was made more affecting to me by the presence of 
the General,whose countenance was as serene and 
unclouded as the day. He seemed to me to enjoy a 
triumph over me. Methought I heard him say, " Ay ! 
I am fairly out and you fairly in ! See which of us 
will be happiest." When the ceremony was over, 
he came and made me a visit, and cordially congratulated me, and wished my administration might be 
happy, successful, and honorable. 
</p><p>
It is now settled that I am to go into his house. It 
is whispered that he intends to take French leave tomorrow. I shall write you as fast as we proceed. 
My chariot is finished, and I made my first appearance in it yesterday. It is simple but elegant enough. 
My horses are young, but clever.

In the chamber of the House of Representatives 
was a multitude as great as the space could contain, 
and I believe scarcely a dry eye but Washington's. 
The sight of the sun setting full orbed, and another 
rising, though less splendid, was a novelty. Chief 
Justice Ellsworth administered the oath, and with 
great energy. Judges Gushing, Wilson, and Iredell, 
were present. Many ladies. I had not slept well 
the night before, and did not sleep well the night 
after. I was unwell and did not know whether I 
should get through or not. I did, however. How 
the business was received I know not, only I have 
been told that Mason, the treaty publisher, said we 
should lose nothing by the change, for he never heard 
such a speech in public in his life. 
</p><p>
All agree that, taken altogether, it was the sublimest thing ever exhibited in America. I am, my 
dearest friend, most affectionately and kindly yours, 
</p><p>
