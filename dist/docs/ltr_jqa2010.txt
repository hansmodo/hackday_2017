As for public affairs I have a great aversion even to 
thinking of them ; and near as we are to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, I should 
know nothing concerning them, if riots, insurrections, and 
anarchy were not at this time the only topics of conversation. The people in four or five counties of this State are 
distracted, and several hundreds of men have repeatedly 
taken arms, and prevented the sitting of the Court of Common Pleas. In Worcester, Berkshire, and Hampshire, the 
people in general are said to be discontented, and to com 
plain of taxation, of the Court of Common Pleas, of the 
salaries of public officers, and of debts, public and private. 
All these are, they think, intolerable grievances, and they 
wish to abolish them. In the other counties, however, 
the people are quiet, and in general firmly attached to their 
constitution. Among the rioters that have appeared several 
times in opposition to the courts of justice, there has not 
been one man of any reputation in the State ; and there 
have been consequently a number of leaders. Three of 
them have lately been taken, and it is probable the others 
will soon share the same fate. The insurrections are not 
immediately dangerous, but our government has not sufficient vigor and energy to suppress them at once. There 
has appeared in the councils a degree of timidity and irresolution, which does no honor to the executive power of a 
commonwealth. It is said to have arisen chiefly from the second citizen in the State, who is now distinguished by the 
ludicrous nick-name of the Old Lady. I am, however, in hopes that in two or three months the public tranquillity 
will be completely restored. I suspect that the present form of government will not continue long, for while the 
idle and extravagant, and consequently the poor, complain of its being oppressive, the men of property and consideration think the constitution gives too much liberty to the 
unprincipled citizen, to the prejudice of the honest and industrious. The opinion that a pure democracy appears 
to much greater advantage in speculation than when reduced to practice gains ground, and bids fair for popularity. 
I feared that by having received so large a share of my education in Europe, my attachment to a republican government would not be sufficient for pleasing my country 
men ; but I find on the contrary that I am the best republican here, and with my classmates, if I ever have any disputes on the subject, I am always obliged to defend 
that side of the question. . . .
