DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
After the fatigue of many days, and of this in particular, I should not sit down, at eleven o clock at night, to write to a gentleman of whose goodness of heart I 
A member of the Continental Congress from Virginia. 
have less doubt than I have of yours ; but well knowing 
that you will pardon what flows from good intentions, 
I venture to say that my hopes are, you will find from 
what the Congress has already done, and from what I 
hope they will do to-morrow, that it has been a capital 
object with us to make your arduous business as easy 
to you as the nature of things will admit. The business 
immediately before us being finished, the approaching 
sickly season here, and the great importance of our 
presence in the Virginia Convention, have determined a 
recess of a month, it standing now, that the Congress 
shall meet here again on the 5th of September. The 
capital object of powder we have attended to as far as 
we could by sending you the other day six tons, and 
to-morrow we shall propose sending six or eight tons 
more, which, with the supplies you may get from Connecticut, and such further ones from here as future 
expected importations may furnish, will, I hope, enable 
you to do all that this powerful article can in good 
hands accomplish. 
</p><p>
We understand here, that batteries may be constructed at the entrance of the Bay of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, so as 
to prevent the egress and regress of any ships what 
ever. If this be a fact, would it not, Sir, be a signal stroke to secure the fleet and army in and before 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, so as to compel a surrender at discretion? 
While I write this I assure you my heart is elated 
with the contemplation of so great an event; a decisive thing that would at once end the war, and vindicate the injured liberties of America. But your 
judgment, and that of your brave associates, will 
best determine the practicability of this business. 
</p><p>
I think we have taken the most effectual measures 
to secure the friendship of the Indians all along our 
extensive frontiers, and, by what we learn of the spirit of our Convention now sitting at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, a spirit 
prevails there very sufficient to secure us on that quarter. The particulars of their conduct I refer you to 
Mr. Frazer for, who comes fresh from thence, and who goes to the camp a soldier of fortune. You know him 
better than I do, and I am sure you will provide for him as he deserves. 
</p><p>
We are here as much in the dark about news from 
England as you are, the London ships having been 
detained long beyond the time they were expected. 
The indistinct accounts we have, tell us of great confusion all over England, and a prodigious fall of the 
stocks. I heartily wish it may be true, but if it is not 
so now, I have no doubt of its shortly being the case. 
</p><p>
I will not detain you longer from more important 
affairs, than to beg the favor of you, when your leisure 
permits, to oblige me by a line by post, to let us know 
how you go on. 
</p><p>
There is nothing I wish so much as your success, 
happiness, and safe return to your family and country, 
because I am with perfect sincerity, dear Sir, your 
affectionate friend and countryman, 
</p><p>
