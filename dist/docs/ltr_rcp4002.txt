My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although our correspondence is rare, my most sincere 
regards for you are uninterrupted. I have outlived, and so 
have you, so many old friends and contemporaries, that the 
very few left are the more valuable for their scarcity ; new 
acquaintances I make the most of, but old and valued friends 
delight me with solid enjoyments, more easily felt than described ; and yet in what is called society, a bystander would 
suppose that I never had any other than the companions of the 
day. I seldom mix with what is now called convivial society ; 
but though an inveterate water-drinker, I can keep pace with 
such society by sympathy. I live with my old friends (not 
seldom with you) as the Swedenborgians do with departed 
spirits. Strong attachment, and zealous recollections work 
up the predisposed fancy into a belief of real presence. It 
is a pleasing delusion, which gray -bearded scrutiny, and 
what is called rational investigation should never extinguish. 
It is a most agreeable and fascinating cullibility, whereof it 
is more wise than foolish to become the willing and unresisting dupe. 
</p><p>
I have continued in my judicial employment more from 
habit than inclination, and it is at times burdensome, and 
always ill requited. I see Congress are about new-modelling 
the department, and what they will make of it, I do not 
know (possibly they do not themselves know), nor do I feel 
much anxiety on the subject. The whole state of things 
is so different from what we in our day contemplated, that 
it is more surprising our judicial arrangements, formed in 
the early stage of our national existence, should have continued so long and so effectively, than that they should now 
be changed. 
</p><p>
My attention to my judicial duty has abstracted me from 
my private affairs ; which arc. however, tree from the embarrassments which have overwhelmed many adventurers, 
who had better have been idle. My thorough-bass amusement 
consists in rural enjoyments, which have been more profitable to others than myself. I have given you a specimen 
of this kind of enjoyment by directing our fourth volume of 
Memoirs to be sent to you, and I hope it will arrive safely 
to your hands. There may not be much instruction, but 
we have assisted in raising our fellow-citizens to proper 
views of the real and substantial interests of our country. 
There is a most gratifying spirit everywhere on this subject, 
by which the rising generation may profit ; but it is too late 
in the day for either you or I to enjoy much of its advantages. So we thought, however, in our revolutionary 
exertions, and yet what a mass of prosperity and happiness 
have we lived to see accumulated in every quarter of our 
country ! When I carry my recollections back to my early 
knowledge of its husbandry, the contrast exhibited by its 
present improvement (yet but imperfect) fills me with most 
pleasing sensations. 
</p><p>
There is a jealousy in our mother country still apparent 
of most of the rapid improvements we have arrived at; and 
I have strong expectations that those in agriculture will ere 
long equal, if not exceed all others. I keep up a good understanding with the British agricultural people with whom 
I come in contact; but it amuses me to perceive that, although many are liberal, many are otherwise. Some 
years ago we sent a volume of our memoirs to Scotland. 
It was very civilly received ; but several of their leading agricultors took occasion to observe that we were an hundred 
years behind them, and even very unequal to English farming. So I left Sawney and John Bull to settle that 
point. I sent lately an American scythe and cradle, which 
they had not before seen ; nor was it used in England. 
They received it graciously ; and I had civil thanks from 
a vice-president of the Board of Agriculture : but he at 
the same time let me know that it was a Flemish, and not 
an American implement. I desired my friend who transmitted the cold civility, to have it labelled "a Flemish implement, sent to England by the way of the United States 
of America /" There is an awkward instrument in Flanders 
containing the rudiments of our scythe and cradle, but as 
unequal to ours as their ships to those of our country ; yet 
ours are American ships^and not a little envied and 
squinted at. 
</p><p>
I have been lately reading, with great pleasure, the Life of 
our late distinguished friend <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Dr. Franklin</a>. Have you read 
it ? I see he glosses over in a letter to the then secretary for 
foreign affairs (Livingston) the affair of Vergennes sending 
his secretary to England, pending our negotiations in the 
treaty of peace. I think you told me all about it ; and I 
have ever had different impressions from those the Dr. 
portrays. He says it was merely to ascertain whether or 
not the British ministry had serious intentions to make an 
equal, solid, and lasting peace with us and our allies. I have 
always believed there was an underplot in the business. I 
think something of this appears in your journal, which I 
assisted to read in Congress in <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a> and 3. Much bruit 
was made then by the French diplomacy, about your signing the preliminaries without previous notice to them ; but 
I always thought you entirely in the right, not only as a security in so important a measure, but to guard against embarrassments, with reason apprehended from the French manoeuvres. I voted against an unwarrantable philippic of censure, brought forward in Congress against your conduct, to 
please the French. I thought then, and do now, that it was 
a mean compliance. Our friend <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'>Madison</a>, who was generally then with us, left his friends on this subject, and I never liked him the better for it. 
</p><p>
I see Congress have rejected the claim of Beaumachi'fl 
representatives. All my recollections put them in the right 
in so doing. True, <a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Silas Deane</a> made an ostensible private 
contract with B. ; but I always was taught to believe him a mere showman, and that the supplies were a gift from France, 
which she could not openly then avow. The unaccounted money, about which much noise has been made, I always believed to have been devoted to secret service and douceurs 
to French agents, whose remunerations could not publicly appear. All or most of the articles went through my hands, 
or under my observation, when in the war office, and a more complete piece of fripponerie never was seen. Very many 
of the articles were worthless, and among them the brass cannon were old rampart pieces, only valuable for the metal, 
which was recast in our foundries. All these things, however, appear now as dreams. What is real, and lives longer 
than these transactions in my memory, is, that I am always, 
and have been, truly and affectionately yours,
