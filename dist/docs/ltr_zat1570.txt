My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your two very acceptable & interesting letters of the 1y th & 24th  
ins t with one from Dr Foltz have this moment reached me, for which you 
have my sincere thanks. In addition to the information which you communicated in regard to Dicks health, I am pleased to say I rec d a letter 
by the last mail from an acquaintance in Little Rock, informing me he 
had been at the Springs with Dick, who he thought had very decidedly 
improved in health, & that if he would remain some 7 or 8 weeks, he 
had but little doubt with prudence, & a proper use of the water he would 
be entirely restored which I truly hope will be the case ; I hope he has 
left by this time & will join his mother & remain with her until I can join 
her. It is always the source of the highest gratification to learn you & 
the children in addition to Mr s T. & Betty were all well & particularly 
surprised to learn the later had changed their minds, & of course Ann 
would be gov d by their movements, as to where they would spend the 
summer, as I had supposed from previous letters they would by this all 
been located at the Harrods Springs ; Betty says the reason for giving up 
that place, was the fear of not being able to get up the Ohio on ace of 
low water, which was all sufficient ; alth I think they would have met 
with light boats enough to have overcome that difficulty had there been 
no doubts as to their reaching <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> without difficulty I would I 
believe on many acct s have preferred the first to the latter plan ; it would 
have been much more invigorating to them all including Ann & the girls, 
as well as much less expensive ; the first would have been better if Mr s 
Taylor had deferred her trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> until about the middle or 
2O th of August, & remained across the Lake until the first or middle of 
Nov r by going over so early in the season she may be weary of the place, 
& wish to return before it is prudent to do so, if the fall should be a sickly 
one. It seems to me your determination of keeping your family with you 
as long as it was healthy, & remove them to where Mr s Taylor & Betty 
was as soon as it became otherwise, was a judicious one, as they can leave 
any time in the course of an hour or two, whenever necessary. I regret 
you thought it advisable to bring Rob down, I had hoped you would have 
found it to his advantage to have left him with Mr Burk, as I regret to 
hear of his losing any time from the prosecution of his studies ; I do not 
believe it would be advisable to send him back to Mr Aliens School as he 
having once left there, it is hardly likely he would remain if sent back 
again ; but you must do the best you can with him. The making of a 
Hospital of the barracks at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> would of itself made it desirable for 
families who could do so should leave there until it was ascertained 
whether the sick sent there from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> would bring with them, or 
disseminate anything like a contagious disease around the place. I think 
you acted right in remaining where you are, particularly as Harney has a 
fee simple right in the station, alth I tremble at the prospect of your 
continuing where you are through the autumn, as you can hardly fail to 
have yellow fever there at some time during the season. I was very much 
pleased to hear the city continued to be healthy, & that the few cases of 
fever which had made its appearance there had not spread beyond the 
Hospital

I am much obliged to Dr Foltz s flattering notice as regards my pros 
pects for the presidency, the realizing of which I am by no means anxious 
to see take place. I notice his remarks in relation to John which was 
very gratifying to me, I hope he John will spend his vacation pleasantly 
among his relatives should he visit them, after which to return to his 
studies with renewed zeal. I mentioned in my last the cours matters 
were taking as regards my Cincinnati letter published in the Signal, it 
will be only a seven days wonder, when it will be forgotten, & amounts 
to nothing more than I do not wish to be the candidate at all, & I hope 
yet to avoid being so ; my family are perfectly right in not desiring that I 
should meddle in it in any way, which I consider shows their good sense. 
I fear neither Judge McGuire nor Col White saw my crop, & spoke from 
hear say, or from the Gen appearance of those they had seen, as my last 
letter from my manager represented my crop as most unpromising, which 
must be correct ; I make no doubt the situation of the place referred to 
by Judge McGuire is as bad as it can be, & shows the necessity of my 
attend to my private affairs in person. Col Taylor has not written to any 
one here or in the country so far as I know, since he left it. I wrote you 
a long letter by the last mail, & have & shall continue to keep you 
advised of every thing of importance in this quarter. My correspond 
ence however is becoming too voluminous, so much so that I may not be 
able to write as often as I wish, or would do under other circumstances, 
this you must not be surprised at, nor must it prevent your continuing to 
write me as often as heretofore, as it allway affords me pleasure to hear 
from you, & of the health & wellfare of yourself and family ; the oftener 
the better. It is out of the question to preserve copies of my letters 
If Dick was or could be with me I would give him charge of all my pri 
vate correspondence ; but in my present position it is out of the question 
to devote much time to political matters without neglecting my public 
duties. I should not be surprised if there was some unkind feelings on 
the part of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> towards the administration on ace of Mr Trist s 1 
powers to conclude a peace, with are full & complete as far as they go, or 
can be made by the executive ; which no doubt the Gen thinks ought to 
have been conferred on him, as I have no doubt he would like to have 
had the handling of the money appropriated by congress for defraying the 
expenses of said negotiation but let them quarrel & fight as they may 
among themselves it will give me no concern ; I can but entertain the 
opinion that Scott & a portion of the administration united to break me 
down, & as they suppose they got me pretty much out of the way, they 
may get on the best or worst way they can ; they are all of a piece

The ultra whigs talk of no compromise you say, nor do I wish them 
to make any, my own cours has been determined on which I shall 
not depart from be the consequences what they may, which is that I have 
no wish to be an exclusive candidate of the whig party alth nomenally 
belonging to it & have no hesitation in saying had I voted at the last elec 
tion for a chief magistrate it would have been for Mr Clay ; this will make 
the ultra Democrats flare up & will furnis Mr Richey & other kindred 
spirits to open an other fire on me, but I will not disguise my opinions 
let the consequences be what they may nor have I any concealments on 
that head

I delivered your letter myself to Jarvis ; who said he had just 
rec d a letter from you Dr Craig leaves in a day or two for the states, 
which make Jarvis medical director A Mr Brown an artis froMrich 
mond has just completed a number of portraits mine among the number, 
</p><p>
that of the officers of my staf as well as a group of myself & staff; he 
leaves in a few days for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> ; if Ann & the children are at the 
Barracks when he gets to the city, I wish you to take to take them to see 
them Betty in her letter stated she expected Mr Conrad 1 & his two 
daughters would go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> with her & her mother ; if so it will 
obviate the necessity of your going over with them, as they could not have 
a better escort, or better protection while he remains with them 
</p><p>
I regret to say the prospects for peace are not as flattering as when 
I last wrote you ; last acct s from Mexico say that negotiation had been 
broken off, & it is supposed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> is now in the City of Mexico ; so 
ends peaceful calculations ; this line is to be barely a defensive one, & all 
the troops that can be spared from it, are to be sent to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> to 
reenforce Gen S. My love to Ann & the children & wishing you & 
yours continued health & prosperity I remain truly
