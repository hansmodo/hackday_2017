Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you have copies of what I had the honor to write on the twenty-fifth of January, and thirteenth of February ; also 
the copy of a letter of the twelfth of February, from Mr Pinckney, with my answer of the eighteenth. I send these last, to 
the end that due attention may be paid to such vessels as may be furnished with his passports, and which may perhaps prove to be British bottoms. 
</p><p>
I am so well persuaded that the United States will strictly 
observe the laws "of nations, and rigidly adhere to their neutrality, that [ am solicitous to prevent a practice which might 
expose us to suspicion, and finally involve us in war. On 
this chapter it is proper also, that I should communicate a fact 
which I have mentioned to Mr Pinckney, and desired him to 
transmit. 
</p><p>
Monsieur Genet took out with him three hundred blank 
commissions, which he is to distribute to such as will fit out cruizers in our ports, to prey on the British commerce. I 
am convinced that few of my countrymen will be so lost to all 
moral sense, as to embark in a game so abominable, where the 
murder of their fellow creatures enters as a leading chance. 
I am apprehensive, however, lest some profligates may be led 
to fix a blot on our national character, and deprive both them 
selves and their countrymen of the great and certain advantages to flow from honest industry on the present important occasion, an occasion, which, duly attended to and properly 
cultivated, will give to our navigation an increase too rapid al 
most for conjecture, and place us in the happy situation to be 
in two or three years the exclusive carriers of our immense 
productions. These considerations weigh much, but they are 
still but a feather in the balance with those of a much higher 
nature, which stand in connexion with the nature of our government, and of course with the happiness of generations to come. 
I know of nothing so dangerous, and I might say fatal to morals, 
as the sudden acquisition of wealth by bad means. Industry 
is thereby discouraged, and honesty discountenanced. The 
vulgar are soon dazzled by the glare of prospering vice, and 
the young are seduced from the paths of virtue ; and virtue 
once gone, freedom is but a name ; for I do not believe it to be 
among possible contingencies, that a corrupted people should 
be for one moment free. Excuse, I pray, my dear Sir, these 
observations, which I cannot restrain. They flow from the 
conviction of my earliest reason, and are strengthened by the 
experience of twenty years. 
</p><p>
In mine of the thirteenth of February, I mentioned to you 
that this country would procure the five hundred thousand 
men required, and at that time there was every reason to think 
so, because the recruiting service went on well for all the new 
corps which had been ordered ; but it now appears that this 
arose from little circumstances of dress and flattery, calculated 
to catch idlers, and that there is a real scarcity of men. The 
losses of the last campaign are sensible in the mass of population, so that notwithstanding the numbers thrown out of em 
ploy by the stagnation of some manufactures, and the reduction of private fortunes, the want of common laborers is felt 
throughout the whole country. Already they talk of drafting 
for the service, an experiment of very doubtful and dangerous 
complexion. Jt would however succeed just now ; but if delayed it would not, I believe, go down ; and at any rate would 
not produce in season the required force ; especially if the enemy should have any considerable successes; for you must 
not imagine that the appearances in this country are all real, 
and you must take into your estimation, that the Convention is 
falling into contempt, because the Tribunes govern it imperiously. They try to save appearances, but the people cannot long 
be dupes. It is the old story of King Log, and how long it 
may be before Jupiter sends them a Crane to destroy the Frogs 
and Froglings, is a matter of uncertainty. Already they begin 
to cry out for a Dictator. An insurrection also is brewing, 
whose object I am told is to destroy the faction of the Gironde. 
I think I mentioned to you, that the death of the King would 
be but the forerunner of their destruction. And already they 
see the sword hanging over their heads. The majority of the 
Convention is clearly at the disposition of their enemies. 
The consuls will forward to you, and you will see in the 
gazettes, the decree for opening all the ports of this nation to 
our vessels on equal terms with their own. You will be so kind 
as to observe, that this was done on a report of the Committee 
of Safety. Now you must know that the members of this 
Committee, or at least a majority of them, are sworn foes to 
the members of the Diplomatic Committee. This is necessary to explain a little of what is said in mine of the 13th, about 
the latter Committee. I have received indirectly a kind of 
assurance from the former, (which disposes entirely of the 
Convention) that they will do anything for the United States 
which I will point out, but in fact I know not anything which 
we ought to ask 5 the decrees above mentioned contain, I believe, all that we want. The history of them is not material. 
</p><p>
I had the honor to mention to you also, that I did not believe the attempt against Holland would succeed, and also that 
time was extremely precious to both parties, especially in regard to Maestricht, in whose fate was involved perhaps that of 
the whole campaign. This town had, I am told, offered to 
capitulate, but terms of such rigor were insisted on, as to induce a longer defence, and this delay has saved them. The 
siege is raised, and unless the French army should gain a vic 
tory, I do not see how they are to escape, provided the enemy 
exerts himself. Dumouriez had taken Breda, and was preparing to enter Holland, being ordered by the Minister of War ; 
to whom he replied, that he would go in, but the Minister 
must find his way out. This latter may be no very easy 
task. The enemy on the side of Maestricht are, I believe, 
superior in numbers ; and certainly if the French in that quarter are beaten, the Allies may cut off the retreat of Dumouriez, in which case his fate must depend not only on the 
strength of his army, not over numerous, but also on the state 
of his magazines, which I believe to be bad. Should Valence be able to make good a gentle retreat, then he may be 
joined perhaps by Dumouriez at Louvain, and together they 
may cover Brussels. 
</p><p>
But all these things, again, depend on some moral contingencies, such for instance as the following questions. What 
will be the temper and spirit of those departments nearest to 
the scene of action ? What will be the degree of hope or apprehension among the inhabitants of the Low Countries ? As 
to them you will see by the gazettes, that they are fast expressing their adherence to the French Republic freely pronounced. 
</p><p>
But since it has been no small question among metaphysicians, what it is that constitutes the freedom of the will, there 
is no small question also on this subject among politicians, as to 
the case before us. Are men actuated by interest, are they 
instigated by desire, are they seduced by hope, are they compelled by fear? Alexander, you know, cut the knot which he 
could not untie, and the French have imitated the example of 
that conqueror. Some striking examples of those, who op 
posed the union with France, induced all the rest to give both 
their speedy and their free consent. It is therefore a problem 
to be resolved, what degree of force must be produced by the 
Allies to operate on the free will of this people, in a counter 
sense. I think the solution of that problem is in Brussels. 
</p><p>
On the whole, my dear Sir, the hour is big with important 
events. As soon as I learn anything more, I will communicate 
it ; in the mean time accept the assurances of that respect, with 
which I have the honor to be, &c.
