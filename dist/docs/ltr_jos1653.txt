Dear Brother: I was unexpectedly called here soon 
after receiving your letter of the 8th, and at midnight 
write you. The military excitement here is intense. 
Since my arrival I have seen all the heads of departments except Blair, several officers, and many citizens. 
There is a fixed determination now to preserve the Union 
and enforce the laws at all hazards. Civil war is actually 
upon us, and strange to say, it brings a feeling of relief : 
the suspense is over. I have spent much of the day in 
talking about you. There is an earnest desire that you 
go into the War Department, but I said this was impossible. Chase is especially desirous that you accept, saying that you would be virtually Secretary of War, and 
could easily step into any military position that offers. 
</p><p>
It is well for you seriously to consider your conclusion, although my opinion is that you ought not to accept. 
You ought to hold yourself in reserve. If troops are 
called for, as they surely will be in a few days, organize 
a regiment or brigade, either in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> or Ohio, and 
you will then get into the army in such a way as to 
secure promotion. By all means take advantage of the 
present disturbances to get into the army, where you will 
at once put yourself in a high position for life. I know 
that promotion and every facility for advancement will 
be cordially extended by the authorities. You are a 
favorite in the army and have great strength in political 
circles. I urge you to avail yourself of these favorable 
circumstances to secure your position for life ; for, after 
all, your present employment is of uncertain tenure in 
these stirring times. 
</p><p>
Let me now record a prediction. Whatever you may 
think of the signs of the times, the Government will rise 
from this strife greater, stronger, and more prosperous 
than ever. It will display^ energy and military power. 
The men who have . confidence in it and do their full 
duty by it may reap whatever there is of honor and 
profit in public life, while those who look on merely as 
spectators in the storm will fail to discharge the highest 
duty of a citizen, and suffer accordingly in public estimation. . . . 
</p><p>
I write this in a great hurry, with numbers around 
me, and exciting and important intelligence constantly 
repeated, even at this hour ; but I am none the less in 
earnest. I hope to hear that you are on the high road 
to the " General " within thirty days. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother, 
</p><p>
