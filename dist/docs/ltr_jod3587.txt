MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
SENATE has been three days in debate upon the appointment of <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> to go to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. It has this 
day been determined in his favor eighteen versus eight. 
</p><p>
You cannot imagine what horror some persons are 
in, lest peace should continue. The prospect of peace 
throws them into distress. Their countenances length 
en at the least opening of an appearance of it. 
Glancing gleams of joy beam from their faces when 
ever all possibility of it seems to be cut off. You 
can divine the secret source of these feelings as well 
as I. The opposition to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> has been quickened 
by motives which always influence every thing in an 
elective government. Pretexts are never wanting to 
ingenious men, but the views of all the principal 
parties are always directed to the election of the first 
magistrate. If Jay should succeed, it will recommend him to the choice of the people for President, 
as soon as a vacancy shall happen. This will weak 
en the hopes of the southern States for Jefferson. 
This I believe to be the secret motive of the opposition to him, though other things were alleged as ostensible reasons; such as, his monarchical principles, 
his indifference about the navigation of the Mississippi, his attachment to England, his aversion to France, 
none of which are well founded, and his holding the 
office of Chief Justice, &c. 
</p><p>
The day is a good omen. May the gentle zephyrs 
waft him to his destination, and the blessing of heaven succeed his virtuous endeavors to preserve peace. 
I am so well satisfied with this measure, that I shall 
run the venture to ask leave to go home, if Congress 
determines to sit beyond the middle of May. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a> is to be Governor, it seems, by a great 
majority of the people; and I am not surprised at it. 
I should have thought human nature dead in the Massachusetts if it had been otherwise. I expect now he 
will be less anti-federal. Gill is to be Lieutenant. 
We will go to <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a> again to congratulate him. 
I thought, however, that Gerry would have been the man. 
</p><p>
We are ill-treated by Britain, and you and I know 
it is owing to a national insolence against us. If they 
force us into a war, it is my firm faith, that they will 
be chastised for it a second time, worse than the first. 
I am, with an affection too tender to be expressed, 
</p><p>
Your 
</p><p>
