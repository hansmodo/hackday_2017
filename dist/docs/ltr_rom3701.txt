Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 27th, from Chatham, has just 
been delivered to me by Colonel Miles, and, in consequence, I have advised him to secure the assistance 
of the President and Council of this State, in case it 
should be necessary. But, as a preferable mode of 
procuring the craft, I advise his engaging to pay 
them in a short time after the service is performed; 
and, if needful, I shall join in this assurance, and 
finally see it performed. 
</p><p>
I directed the Commissary-General, immediately on 
my return from camp, to cause the deposit of three 
hundred barrels of flour, three hundred barrels of salt 
meat, and twelve hogsheads of rum, to be made at 
the Head of Elk, and pointed out the means of obtaining them. For this purpose, he sent down a 
Deputy some clays since, and I expect all will be 
ready there. I have written to the Quarter-master of 
Delaware and Maryland, Mr. Donaldson Gates, to exert himself in procuring the craft. I am much more 
apprehensive on the score of craft in Delaware and 
Chesapeake. I have written to the Governor, and 
several of the most eminent merchants in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, to 
extend their assistance and influence in expediting this 
business. Foreseeing the necessity of supplies from 
Maryland and Delaware, I have written, in the most 
pressing terms, to the Governors and Agents, to have 
the specific supplies required of them by Congress in 
readiness for delivery to my order; and now that 
your movements must be unfolded to them, I shall 
still more strongly show the necessity, and stimulate 
their exertions by holding forth what is due to their 
own immediate interest and safety. But still I fear 
you will be disappointed in some degree as to the 
shipping, and that I shall be compelled to make purchases of provisions, which, if it happens, must divert 
the money from those payments to the army that I 
wish to make. I have already advised your Excellency of the unhappy situation of money matters, and 
very much doubt if it will be possible to pay the detachment a month's pay, as you wish. Therefore it 
will be best not to raise in them any expectation of 
that kind. Should it come unexpectedly, so much the 
better. I do not think it practicable to provide the 
salt provisions here, even if a disappointment happens 
in New England; but have particularly recommended 
attention to the article in Maryland, which is to furnish ten thousand five hundred barrels of beef and 
pork. 
</p><p>
No news here yet of the Count de Grasse ; but I 
have had occasion to lament that too many people have, for some clays past, seemed to know your Excellency's intended movements. This city is filled with 
strangers, so that Colonel Miles cannot procure private 
lodgings, and my family being chiefly at Springetsbury, affords me the opportunity of appropriating my 
house in town to your use. I believe we can accommodate your Aids, &c., with mattresses, but our beds 
are chiefly in the country; and as what I have cannot possibly be appropriated to a better use, I beg 
your Excellency will consider and use my house, and 
what it affords, as your own. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, your devoted servant,
