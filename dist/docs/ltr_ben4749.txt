SIR, 
</p><p>
As you have printed here your letter of yesterday to your 
friend in America, and it may be long before you receive an 
answer from thence, permit me in the mean time to give you a 
few remarks on it, submitting them, as you have done your 
Letter, to the Public. 
</p><p>
The disposition you shew to promote peace and harmony 
between the two countries, is commendable: But if you 
wish to have any influence with us Americans as a mediator, 
methinks you should have avoided giving us ground for suspicion that you are prejudiced against us, and that you have 
imbibed notions of us extremely injurious, and not founded 
in fact. 
</p><p>
You speak of us as a people unreasonable enough to expect 
protection from Britain, without contributing towards the 
expense, which is far from being the case. The King has 
no subjects more willing to grant him aids in proportion to 
their abilities. 
</p><p>
You speak of our "dangerous and vain expectations of 
becoming independent," and say that "certainly there are 
such among us." j Allow me to tell you, that you are certainly 
mistaken, and that there is not a single wish in the colonies 
to be free from subjection to their amiable sovereign the King 
of Great-Britain, and the constitutional dependence thence 
arising; and the charging them with such views is a cruel 
calumny, which you ought not to have countenanced, much less to have asserted it as a certain fact, j 
</p><p>
You bring an account against us of Eighty Millions, which 
you say this nation has run in debt by a war commenced for 
our protection ; and this, joined with your groundless insinuations of our unwillingness to contribute to the exigencies of 
the crown, seems intended to make us odious, as being both 
burthensome and ungrateful. We cannot take this well of 
you, when it is known that that war was commenced, not to 
defend the colonies (who were in profound peace, and had 
given no offence to their neighbours, either Indians or French) 
but to protect the British trade with the Indians which the 
French had interrupted, and to remove their incroachments 
on the King's wilderness lands in Acadia. We have never 
engaged Britain in any war on our account, but have constantly managed our Indian wars ourselves, without asking 
help from hence, either of men or money. On the other hand, 
by our connexion with Britain we are unavoidably drawn into 
all her wars, and always have, as it was our duty, borne our 
part of them without murmuring. And you might, with more 
propriety, have charged that expence of Eighty Millions to 
the manufactures of Birmingham, Yorkshire, Manchester, 
Norwich, &c. or to the British merchants, since the securing 
a vent for their goods, and the freedom and extention of their 
trade, was more the motive of the war, than our protection, 
who asked for none. But you pass them over as Hanover, 
Portugal, and the East India company, whose protection was 
expressly intended by Britain, and indeed highly expensive 
to her; tho' left intirely out of your account, that the odium 
of the whole may be laid on us. As to the " burning all our 
maritime towns," which you would intimidate us with, I 
shall only say, that I wonder how so barbarian a thought 
came into a peaceable man's head. This brave and generous 
nation can never proceed to such excesses against us, merely 
for vindicating our rights, and endeavouring to secure them 
by the quiet measures of industry and frugality. However, 
if our property is not in fact our own, but may be taken from 
us, at the pleasure of others without our consent, it is no 
matter how soon it is burnt; it is not worth belonging on 
such terms. 
</p><p>
You further intimate that our using British manufactures 
gives us no merit with this nation, because we must have used 
them if our ancestors had not migrated, and we had of course 
been born here. This is an ingenious argument, which I 
will not dispute, but only observe, that if Britain is not obliged 
by our buying her goods, we hope she will not be disobliged 
by our refusing them; since if we had been both here we 
might have worked for ourselves, and that is only what we are 
now about to do. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, as we are not presumptuous enough to ask 
an union with Britain, such as England contracted with Scotland, we have no "proposition" to make, but that she would 
leave us the enjoyment of our native and dear-bought privileges, and not attempt to alter or innovate our constitutions, 
in the exercise of which everything went prosperously for 
both countries, till the idea of taxing us by the power of Parliament unfortunately entered the heads of your ministers, 
which had occasioned a public discussion of questions that 
had better never been started, and thrown all into confusion. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with great respect for your good intentions, 
equally a lover of peace with yourself, and also 
Your well wishing friend, 
</p><p>
FRANCIS LYNN, 
</p><p>
of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in New-England.
