FRIENDS OSMAN--I was most agreeably surprised by a visit from my friend Dr. Hall, who is on his way home. If I can rejoice at the success of any man, it is at his, for one of a better heart or more moral honesty I never met. He is one who returns unscathed by the vices of California and is the same here as at home. He is among those who are entitled to my best regards, and I cordially hope that his last days may be prosperous and happy.
</p><p>
I wish you would tell McNeil to write me, for in our long sojourn together, in the hour of trial and amid danger and difficulty, I learned to appreciate his kindness and good will. Oh! how I should love to sit down with some of those old returned Californians and while away an hour or two in talking over our travels along the Nemahas, the Platte, the plains, the desert, the cañons, and the mountains. I could almost come on purpose to see Captain George Green and the brave old pioneer, his father, and other good men and true who suffered the perils of that arduous trip. You see my heart is expanding towards them, and I can't help giving utterance to my feelings.
</p><p>
As your country is great for reports, I have been amused--not offended--at one I have recently heard respecting myself and to this effect, "th<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ald" rel="me">A. DELANO.</a>provided nothing for his family when he left home, that he had sent them nothing since he has been here, and that he traveled across the plains with another woman." As to the first two, it may spoil a good story when I refer the lovers of the dark side to my own family for the truth of the two first counts, and for the third, I simply ask those who traveled in our train to state the facts. As for women, I did save the life of one here in San Francisco, and gave her shelter and protection after the fire for two or three days, until she got a situation with Captain <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" >Sutter's</a> family at one thousand dollars a year; and could you hear her story, it would be that of respect, and that even here a man may do a good deed
which he may not blush to own. Except this one, who by circumstances was thrown upon my protection by a course of events--an interesting tale of itself--when a man should blush not to do as I did, and when I was encouraged by pious and good people of both sexes, there are not three other females in California that even know my name; and I do not blush, nor need any of my friends blush for any act of mine since I have been in this God-forsaken land, nor will they have occasion to. I feel that it is scarcely necessary for me to speak a word in defense of myself, and I drop the subject.
</p><p>
We are in the midst of certainly a moral and nearly a political revolution. The outrages upon the order-loving people have been so great--so many murders, robberies, and incendiary conflagrations have been committed, not only here but throughout California, and so wretchedly has the law been administered, that the people have arisen in their might to protect themselves.
</p><p>
Since the great fire, eight different palpable attempts have been made to fire the city. It is no longer safe to walk the streets after dark unarmed, and we do not know when we lay down at night but that before the morning sun our dwellings may be burnt to ashes. The magistrates and police cannot execute the laws if they would. Lawyers are found who will make the technicalities and subtleties of the law subservient to the horde of villains who are in our midst, to screen them from justice. The penal colonies of Great Britain are emptying their hordes of convicts upon our shores, and every arrival from Sydney swells the number by hundreds. A mass meeting was held on the Plaza yesterday--another today, and another will be held tomorrow, to adopt some measures to protect ourselves and check the crime that is carrying murder and desolation to our citizens in their dwellings. This is no fancy sketch. Ask any man who is returning from California--he will attest its truth.
</p><p>
A man was caught in the act of setting fire to the city a few days ago. He is in the hands of the law and will escape Night before last a man was caught with a safe which he had stolen. He was seized, tried by the citizens fairly and impartially, found guilty, and hung before daylight
</p><p>
There are thousands upon the Plaza today, and with a small exception, the feeling of self-defense was the ruling one. A few attempted to stem the popular current, and a gang of bullies and rowdies attempted to put down the movement on the part of the people, and at one time there were indications of a severe fight. But the people triumphed--resolutions passed which amounted to little
else than revolution, and tomorrow another mass meeting is to be held.
</p><p>
All men regret that the exigencies of the case demand the stormy interposition of the people to punish crime, but lamentable as it is, the case is necessary. No man has ever been legally executed for murder in San Francisco, and but two in the State, out of the hundreds committed. In one of the cases alluded to it was for a cool unprovoked murder of an influential citizen. The culprit was condemned to be hung, but the Governor (McDougal) gave him a respite and then a full pardon, but the people broke into the jail and executed the just sentence themselves Some forty persons have been murdered here since last fall, and every murderer has escaped. You can form but little idea of the actual state of things, but Dr. Hall can tell you more than I have time to write.
</p><p>
The city is nearly rebuilt since the fire. I am once more in my old office--rather, in a new one, where the old one stood. I find my actual loss by the fire was a little over twelve hundred dollars, but as luck would have it, it didn't break me. It came a little hard, as it was money loaned out.--Quartz mining is still good and will be for ages.
</p><p>
Business, I mean merchandising, is good for nothing. Goods are lower than in New York--even in the mines it does not pay as a general thing. Men dare not employ capital, and there is neither confidence nor credit.
</p><p>
I am writing out my journal as I get leisure, and although I have not determined to publish it, I may conclude to do so eventually
</p><p>
After leaving the Humboldt we were in a country but little known, and almost every day presented something new and strange. I saw in a number of the Free Trader that a regular trade had sprung up between San Francisco and Sydney in importing women who are sold at public auction. This is certainly news to us. No such thing has happened since I have been a resident of the city, and all I can learn about it is that about a year ago some females were brought from Sydney, and by their own consent their time was sold by the Captain long enough to pay their passage. I send you a
</p><p>
Courier (Daily) which contains a Pen Knife Whittling--the last number --I am writing hurriedly, as you perceive.
</p><p>
I can't tell when I shall come home. Perhaps your newsmongers will have me married again soon, and then you know I shall not dare come. There are many of your citizens for whom I entertain warm feelings of friendship, and I hope to take them by the hand within a year.--I'm growing garrulous and will close.
</p><p>
Truly yours,
</p><p>
A. DELANO
