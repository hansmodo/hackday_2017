This morning we heard Jimmy is engaged to Helen Trenholm, daughter of the Secretary of the Confederate States. He wrote asking Brother's consent, 
saying they had been engaged since August, though he had had no opportunity of writing until that day 
the middle of September. I cried myself blind. It seems that our last one is gone. But this is the first 
selfish burst of feeling. Later I shall come to my senses and love my sister that is to be. But my darling! my darling! O Jimmy! How can I give you 
up? You have been so close to me since Harry died !

Alone now; best so.
