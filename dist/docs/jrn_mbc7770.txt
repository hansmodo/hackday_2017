<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='5'>5th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Is the sea drying up ? Is it going up into mist and coming down on us in a water-spout? The rain, 
it raineth every day. The weather typifies our tearful despair, on a large scale. It is also Lent now a quite convenient custom, for we, in truth, have nothing to eat. So we fast and pray, and go dragging to church like drowned rats to be preached at.

My letter from my husband was so well, what in a woman you would call heart-broken, that I began to get 
ready for a run up to Charlotte. My hat was on my head, my traveling-bag in my hand, and Ellen was saying 
" Which umbrella, ma am?" . Stop, Ellen," said I, "someone is speaking out there. A tap came at the door, 
and Miss McLean threw the door wide open as she said in a triumphant voice : " Permit me to announce General Chesnut." As she went off she sang out, " Oh, does not a meeting like this make amends ? : 
</p><p>
We went after luncheon to see Mrs. Munroe. My husband wanted to thank her for all her kindness to me. I was 
awfully proud of him. I used to think that everybody had the air and manners of a gentleman. I know now that these 
accomplishments are things to thank God for. Father O Connell came in, fresh from Columbia, and with news 
at last. <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> men had burned the convent. Mrs. Munroe had pinned her faith to <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> because he was a 
Roman Catholic, but Father O Connell was there and saw it. The nuns and girls marched to the old Hampton house 
(Mrs. Preston's now), and so saved it. They walked between files of soldiers. Men were rolling tar barrels and 
lighting torches to fling on the house when the nuns came. Columbia is but dust and ashes, burned to the ground. 
Men, women, and children have been left there homeless, houseless, and without one particle of food reduced to 
picking up corn that was left by <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> horses on picket grounds and parching it to stay their hunger.

How kind my friends were on this, my fete day ! Mrs. Rutledge sent me a plate of biscuit ; Mrs. Munroe, nearly 
enough food supplies for an entire dinner ; Miss McLean a cake for dessert. Ellen cooked and served up the mate 
rial happily at hand very nicely, indeed. There never was a more successful dinner. My heart was too full to eat, but 
I was quiet and calm ; at least I spared my husband the trial 
of a broken voice and tears. As he stood at the window, with his back to the room, he said : Where are they now my old blind father and my sister ? Day and night I see her leading him out from under his own rooftree. That 
picture pursues me persistently. But come, let us talk of pleasanter things." To which I answered, " Where will you find them? "

He took off his heavy cavalry boots and Ellen carried them away to wash the mud off and dry them. She brought 
them back just as Miss Middleton walked in. In his agony, while struggling with those huge boots and trying to get 
them on, he spoke to her volubly in French. She turned away from him instantly, as she saw his shoeless plight, and 
said to me, "I had not heard of your happiness. I did not know the General was here." Not until next day did we 
have time to remember and laugh at that outbreak of French. Miss Middleton answered him in the same language. He told her how charmed he was with my surroundings, and that he would go away with a much lighter heart 
since he had seen the kind people with whom he would leave me.

I asked my husband what that correspondence between <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> and Hampton meant this while I was preparing 
something for our dinner. His back was still turned as he gazed out of the window. He spoke in the low and steady 
monotone that characterized our conversation the whole day, and yet there was something in his voice that thrilled 
me as he said : The second day after our march from Columbia we passed the M. s. He was a bonded man and not 
at home. His wife said at first that she could not find for age for our horses, but afterward she succeeded in procuring some. I noticed a very handsome girl who stood beside her as she spoke, and I suggested to her mother the propriety of sending her out of the track of both armies. Things were no longer as heretofore; there was so much 
straggling, so many camp followers, with no discipline, on the outskirts of the army. The girl answered quickly, I wish to stay with my mother. That very night a party of 
Wheeler's men came to our camp, and such a tale they told of what had been done at the place of horror and destruction, the mother left raving. The outrage had been committed before her very face, she naving been secured first. After this crime the fiends moved on. There were only seven of them. They had been gone but a short time when 
Wheeler's men went in pursuit at full speed and overtook them, cut their throats and wrote upon their breasts: 
These were the seven!

"But the girl? " 
</p><p>
"Oh, she was dead! "

" Are his critics as violent as ever against the President? " asked I when recovered from pity and horror. 
" Sometimes I think I am the only friend he has in the world. At these dinners, which they give us everywhere, 
I spoil the sport, for I will not sit still and hear Jeff Davis abused for things he is no more responsible for than any 
man at that table. Once I lost my temper and told them it sounded like arrant nonsense to me, and that Jeff Davis 
was a gentleman and a patriot, with more brains than the assembled company." " You lost your temper truly," 
said I. And I did not know it. I thought I was as cool as I am now. In Washington when we left, Jeff Davis 
ranked second to none, in intellect, and may be first, from the South, and <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> was the friend of Mrs. Emory, 
Mrs. Joe Johnston, and Mrs. Montgomery Blair, and others of that circle. Now they rave that he is nobody, and never 
was." " And she? " I asked. " Oh, you would think to hear them that he found her yesterday in a Mississippi 
swamp! " " Well, in the French Revolution it was worse. When a man failed he was guillotined. Mirabeau did not 
die a day too soon, even Mirabeau."

He is gone. With despair in my heart I left that rail road station. Allan Green walked home with me. I met his 
wife and his four ragged little boys a day or so ago. She is the neatest, the primmest, the softest of women. Her 
voice is like the gentle cooing of a dove. That lowering black future hangs there all the same. The end of the war 
brings no hope of peace or of security to us. Ellen said I had a little piece of bread and a little molasses in store for my dinner to-day.
