DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since I had the honor of writing you on the 
28th instant, I have been endeavouring to obtain intelligence of the situation of the enemy at <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, 
&c. I learn that their naval force, not long since, 
consisted of one ship of seventy-four guns, one of 
twenty, one sloop of war, and two or three privateers. 
General McLean, a vigilant officer, commands the 
land forces, which are said to consist of six regiments, each about five hundred strong, four of which 
are at <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, the other two at different posts in 
the province. The militia of the town is said to be 
about eleven hundred. 
</p><p>
From a gentleman, of the strictest probity and 
warmest attachment to our cause, and who has made upwards of forty voyages from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, I 
learn that, when he was last there, which was before 
the commencement of hostilities, the enemy had a 
strong work on George's Island, at the entrance of 
the harbour; another about half a mile from the centre of the town, and about the same distance from 
George's Island ; a battery on the east side, about 
two miles below, or without George's Island ; a battery also at the town ; the ship-yard and Arsenal 
about a mile above the town, where there is another 
battery. The basin begins just above the ship-yard, 
and extends up about six miles northerly, from east 
to west. Between three and four miles above the 
Navy Yard was a block-house, at a place called the 
Narrows. The citadel is on a high hill, back of the 
town, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, and 
commands both the town and harbour. The basin is 
very spacious, capable, perhaps, to contain the whole 
navy of England. 
</p><p>
I have just called at the Honorable Mr. Bowdoin's. 
He has preserved a chart of the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>; has 
made several inquiries of the gentleman I mentioned 
in my last, who, I believe, without the least suspicion, 
answered every one of them. Mr. Bowdoin is now 
making some minutes explanatory of the chart and 
the information he has received from the gentleman. 
The chart and minutes he will forward by to-morrow's 
or the next post, to your Excellency. I am looking 
out for the best pilots, and believe shall find a number of very good ones. 
</p><p>
By the last accounts from Penobscot, there were 
appearances of an evacuation, or the removal of a 
part of the ordnance and troops to some other place. 
The garrison at Penobscot, at present, is by no means 
strong, at most not more than four hundred. Captain 
La Touche, of his most Christian Majesty's frigate the 
Hermione, in his late cruise, ran into Penobscot Bay, 
where he lay for some time, made several signals, 
and took a plan of the works, which he has forwarded to the Minister at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. It is said the 
appearance of this frigate in the Bay has caused a 
great consternation and alarm. 
</p><p>
I have just established a correspondence with General Wadsworth, who commands the troops in the 
eastern parts of this State, and with Colonel Allen, 
at Machias, and have requested every piece of intelligence they may be able to obtain, either from Halifax or Penobscot. 
</p><p>
The last night,, I received most alarming accounts 
from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, of the scantiness of provisions and 
rum at that post, A quantity of the latter is on the 
road to Springfield. Since I have been here, I have 
been endeavouring to promote the recruiting service 
all in my power; but the Court Unfortunately stop 
ping the towns bounties, in the settlements with the 
soldiers, has almost totally prevented enlistments. 
The new Assembly convened this day. I apprehend 
they will go any lengths that are recommended, to 
complete their quota, even by drafts, if they cannot 
be otherwise obtained. I wish to know your Excellency's pleasure, whether I shall urge it, arid how 
far. 
</p><p>
The issuing Commissary here informs me that there 
are upwards of nine hundred quintals of dry codfish 
in the stores, a considerable part of which will be 
in danger of spoiling in the course of the summer, if 
it is not issued. What pity it is that the army, in 
their present straits, cannot be relieved by it. 
</p><p>
A report prevails, to-day, that the Trumbull frigate 
and a French ship have re-taken the Iris, formerly 
the Hancock frigate, off Sandy Hook. I hope it will 
be confirmed. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
