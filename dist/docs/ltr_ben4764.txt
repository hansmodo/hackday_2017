GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I received yours of the i8th of April, enclosing copies of 
the articles of your agreements with respect to importation, 
and of your letter to the merchants here. The letter was published, and universally spoken well of, as a well written, sensible, manly, and spirited performance; and I believe the 
publication has been of service to our cause. You are in my 
opinion perfectly right in your supposition, that "the redress of American grievances likely to be proposed by the 
ministry will at first only be partial; and that it is intended 
to retain some of the revenue duties, in order to establish a 
right of Parliament to tax the colonies." But I hope, that, 
by persisting steadily in the measure you have so laudably 
entered into, you will, if backed by the general honest resolution of the people to buy British goods of no others, but to 
manufacture for themselves, or use colony manufactures 
only, be the means, under God, of recovering and establishing the freedom of our country entire, and of handing it down 
complete to posterity.

And in the mean time the country will be enriched by its 
industry and frugality. These virtues will become habitual. 
Farms will be more improved, better stocked, and rendered 
more productive by the money that used to be spent in superfluities. Our artificers of every kind will be enabled to carry 
on their business to more advantage; gold and silver will 
become more plenty among us, and trade will revive, after 
things shall be well settled, and become better and safer 
than it has lately been ; for an industrious, frugal people are 
best able to buy, and pay best for what they purchase. With 
great regard, I have the honour to be, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
