The result of what I have seen and heard concerning the enemy is, that they have encamped with 
their van a little beyond Monmouth Court-House, and 
their rear at Manalapan's River, about seven miles 
from this place. Their march to-day has been very 
judiciously conducted, their baggage in front and 
their flying army in the rear, with a rear-guard of 
one thousand men, about four hundred pas from 
the main body. To attack them in this situation, 
without being supported by the whole army, would 
be folly in the extreme. If it should be thought 
advisable to give the necessary support, the army 
can move to some position near the enemy's left 
flank, which would put them in a very awkward 
situation, with so respectable a body in their rear ; 
and it would put it out of their power to turn either 
flank, should they be so disposed. Their left is 
strongly posted, and I am told their right also. By 
some accounts, one part of his army lies on the road 
leading from the Monmouth road to South Amboy. 
It is not improbable that South Amboy may be the 
object.

I had written thus far when your letter to the Marquis arrived. This puts the matter on a totally 
different footing. The detachment will march tomorrow morning, at three o clock, to <a href='/results.php?city=englishtown' rel='city'>Englishtown</a>. I 
am, with great esteem and respect,

Your obedient servant,
