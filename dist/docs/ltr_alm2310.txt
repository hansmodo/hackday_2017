Headquarters, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=peekskill" rel="city">Peekskill</a>, 20th March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>.

SIR,
</p><p>
My late intelligence from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a> and headquarters clearly mark the
enemy's intention to make a movement very soon. Whether it is intended
against the grand army, these posts, or New-London, time only can
determine. It is, however, our duty to be prepared. As a few days will
open up his views, I imagine you do not think of quitting the ground
when business is to be done. Should the enemy move up the river in
force, his thieves will be very busy below. Colonel Hammond's
regiment, on such an event, is to remain there; and one hundred rank
and file of continental troops only are to keep them in countenance.
The rest, under charge of officers, to be sent up to join their corps.
</p><p>
You know the state of forage at this post. I wish you would make an
exertion to your left in front, to secure all you can for us; as much
as will consist with the safety of your party, and covering to the
rebels at Tarrytown. Send for Haynes and his assistant, and keep them
on the ground till they secure all that is practicable to be got from
your left. The weather has been so stormy and uncertain, the ----- are
not yet sent for. To-morrow morning it will be done. Please to attend
to the enclosed order respecting provisions. Late Learned's is moved
to West Point.
</p><p>
Major Hull's, of the 19th, is this moment received, and will be
attended to. I wish Captain Kearsley, Lieutenants Hunter and Lawrence,
to be sent to their regiments when Colonel Burr has finished what he
intends. They are much wanted. Note the contents of the enclosed
resolve.
</p><p>
Yours, very respectfully,
</p><p>
