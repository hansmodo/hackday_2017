DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It never was my idea to leave the Highlands unguarded, but only for expedition's sake that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wih" rel="colleague met">Heath</a> 
should detach two thousand of his corps immediately 
over the river, and to replace these two thousand by 
the same number, the most lightly accoutred, from 
this body here, till the main body, with their baggage, cannon, &c., could move. I conceived this movement could be attended with no risk, as he has now 
nothing to guard but the western passages; for there 
is no possibility of their approaching by the eastern, 
having, as I can learn, no vessels on the eastern 
river to transport their cannon, and the road from 
King's Bridge by land is now almost impracticable.

Yesterday they drew themselves in, and we made a sweep of the country from Phillips's house. Part of 
the army have moved on. I set out to-morrow. No militia are come in to cover the country. I have 
wrote most pressing letters on this subject to Trumbull, and hope they will have effect. I have been 
equally urgent with Mr. Bowdoin for blankets, shoes, 
&c. Indeed, our soldiers are not in a moving condition, but seem well disposed, and engage themselves 
beyond expectation. But we are in great want of 
money for bounty. I have been under the necessity, 
without authority, to draw for this purpose. Several 
deserters, come out to-day, inform us that a considerable embarkation is made for Amboy. 
</p><p>
I shall take care to obey your Excellency's order, in regard to my march, as exactly as possible; and am, 
Dear General, yours, 
</p><p>
