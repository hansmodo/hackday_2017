MY DEAR,
</p><p>
I RATE written but once to you since I left you. This is to be imputed to a variety of causes, which 
I cannot explain for want of time. It would fill volumes to give you an exact idea of the whole tour. 
My time is totally filled from the moment I get out of bed until I return to it. Visits, ceremonies, company, business, newspapers, pamph ets, &c. &c. &c. 
</p><p>
The Congress will, to all present appearance, be well united, and in such measures as, I hope, will give 
satisfaction to the friends of our country. A Tory here is the most despicable animal in the creation. 
Spiders, toads, snakes are their only proper emblems. The Massachusetts Councillors and Addressers are 
held in curious esteem here, as you will see. The spirit, the firmness, the prudence of our province are 
vastly applauded, and we are universally acknowledged, the saviours and defenders of American liberty. 
The designs and plans of the Congress must not be 
communicated until completed, and we shall move with great deliberation. 
</p><p>
When I shall come home I know not, but at present, I do not expect to take my leave of this city 
these four weeks. My compliments, love, service, where they are due. My babes are never out of my mind, nor absent from my heart 
</p><p>
Adieu. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">JOHN ADAMS</a>.
