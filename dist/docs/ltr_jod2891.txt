WE have at last crossed the Delaware and are agreeably lodged at Easton, a little town situated on a point 
of land formed by the Delaware on one side, and the river Lehigh on the other. There is an elegant stone church here, built by the Dutch people, by whom the 
town is chiefly inhabited, and what is remarkable because uncommon, the Lutherans and Calvinists united to build this church, and the Lutheran and Calvinist 
ministers, alternately, officiate in it There is also a handsome Court House. The buildings, public and private, are all of limestone. Here are some Dutch Jews.

Yesterday, we had the pleasure of seeing the Moravian mills in New Jersey. These mills belong to 
the society of Moravians in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=bethlehem" rel="city">Bethlehem</a> in Pennsylvania, They are a great curiosity. The building is of 
limestone, four stories high. It is not in my power to give a particular description of this piece of mechanism. A vast quantity of grain of all sorts is collected here.

We have passed through the famous county of Sussex in New Jersey, where the Sussex Court House stands, and where, we have so often been told, the Tories are so numerous and dangerous. We met 
with no molestation nor insult. We stopped at some of the most noted Tory houses, and were treated every 
where with the utmost respect. Upon the strictest inquiry I could make, I was assured, that a great majority 
of the inhabitants are stanch whigs. Sussex, they say, can take care of Sussex. And yet all agree that there are more Tories in that county than in any 
other. If the British army should get into that county, in sufficient numbers to protect the Tories, there is no doubt to be made, they would be insolent 
enough, and malicious and revengeful. But there is no danger, at present, and will be none, until that event takes place. The weather has been sometimes 
bitterly cold, sometimes warm, sometimes rainy, and sometimes snowy, and the roads abominably hard and rough, so that this journey has been the most tedious 
I ever attempted. Our accommodations have been often very bad, but much better and cheaper than they would have been, if we had taken the road from Peekskill to Morristown, where the army lies.
