DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
We have been so baffled by the weather, that we 
only arrived here last night. I believe we shall find 
no difficulties in procuring a sufficient body of volunteers for the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> expedition. The unhappy 
accounts from Canada seem to animate these people, 
rather than depress. Indeed, we have new occasion 
for exertion and decision. I am apprehensive that 
the Congress must be inspired by you. They have 
just given a strong, and, I think, unfortunate instance 
of indecision. Colonel Waterbury had raised a regiment. The regiment was equipped, and ready for embarkation. They were to have landed in Oyster Bay, 
to have attacked the Tories in Long Island. Lord 
Stirling was to have attacked them on the other side. 
All this by order of Congress; when suddenly Colonel Waterbury received an order to disband his regiment ; and the Tories are to remain unmolested till 
they are joined by the King's assassins. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a></a>, like a man of sense and spirit, has ordered this regiment to be reassembled. I believe it will be ready on Sunday, the day on which 
I shall march from this town. I shall send immediately an express to the Congress, informing them of my situation, and, at the same time, conjuring them 
not to suffer the accursed Provincial Congress of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to defeat measures so absolutely necessary to salvation. 
</p><p>
The affairs of Canada will, I suppose, very soon, if not instantly, require a very considerable force from this Province. Neither will the circumstances of New 
York admit of its being too much stripped of men, for which reason I should think it advisable immediately to raise some additional regiments in Massachusetts Bay. Adieu, dear General. God prosper you and the arms of virtue ! 
</p><p>
Yours, most sincerely, 
</p><p>
