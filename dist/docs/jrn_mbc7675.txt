Bragg begs to be relieved of his command. The army will be relieved to get rid of him. He 
has a winning way of earning everybody's detestation. Heavens, how they hate him ! The rapid flight of his army 
terminated at Ringgold. Hardie declines even a temporary command of the Western army. Preston Johnston has been 
sent out post-haste at a moment's warning. He was not even allowed time to go home and tell his wife good-by or, 
as Browne, the Englishman, said, to put a clean shirt into his traveling bag." <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=grm' rel=''>Meade</a> are facing each other gallantly.

The first of December we went with a party of Mrs. Quid's getting up, to see a French frigate which lay at 
anchor down the river. The French officers came on board our boat. The Lees were aboard. The French officers were 
not in the least attractive either in manners or appearance, but our ladies were most attentive and some showered bad 
French upon them with a lavish hand, always accompanied by queer grimaces to eke out the scanty supply of French 
words, the sentences ending usually in a nervous shriek. " Are they deaf? " asked Mrs. Randolph. 
</p><p>
The French frigate was a dirty little thing. Doctor Garnett was so buoyed up with hope that the French were 
coming to our rescue, that he would not let me say " an 
English man-of-war is the cleanest thing known in the world. " Captain said to <a href='/results.php?tla=mnc' rel='acquaintance met'>Mary Lee</a>, with a foreign 
contortion of countenance, that went for a smile, " I's bashlor. " Judge Ould said, as we went to dinner on our 
own steamer, " They will not drink our President's health. 
They do not acknowledge us to be a nation. Mind, none 
of you say Emperor, not once." Doctor Garnett interpreted the laws of politeness otherwise, and stepped for 
ward, his mouth fairly distended with so much French, and said: " Vieff Emperor." Young Gibson seconded him 
quietly, "A la sante de I Empereur." But silence prevailed. Preston Hampton was the handsomest man on 
board the figure of Hercules, the face of Apollo, cried an enthusiastic girl. Preston was as lazy and as sleepy as 
ever. He said of the Frenchmen "They can't help not being good-looking, but with all the world open to them, to 
wear such shabby clothes ! "

The lieutenant's name was Rousseau. On the French frigate, lying on one of the tables was a volume of Jean 
Jacques Rousseau's works, side by side, strange to say, with a map of South Carolina. This lieutenant was courteously 
asked by <a href='/results.php?tla=mnc' rel='acquaintance met'>Mary Lee</a> to select some lady to whom she might introduce him. He answered: " I shuse you," with a bow 
that was a benediction and a prayer. 
</p><p>
And now I am in a fine condition for Hetty Gary's starvation party, where they will give thirty dollars for the 
music and not a cent for a morsel to eat. Preston said contentedly, I hate dancing, and I hate cold water ; so I will 
eschew the festivity to-night."

Found John R. Thompson at our house when I got home so tired to-night. He brought me the last number of the 
Cornhill. He knew how much I was interested in Trollope's story, Framley Parsonage.
