</p><p>
SIR: I embrace the first leisure moment since my return home to enclose 
to you a copy of a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a>, the original of which was handed 
to me on my passage from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> to Norfolk, on board the steamboat, 
and also a copy of my answer. 
</p><p>
You will learn, by a perusal of Mr. Forsyth's letter, that it refers to the 
correspondence between us, and that it places the subject of that correspondence in a light in some respects different from what I had previously 
regarded it. I had supposed, from the complexion of your letters to me, 
that the copy of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>'s letter to Mr. Forsyth had been placed by 
the latter in your hands, without any previous act or agency on your part; 
but, by Mr. Forsyth's letter to me, I am informed that such is not the fact. 
It seems that he acted as your agent in the affair. He states that you applied 
to him to be informed of what took place in the cabinet of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> on 
the subject of the Seminole campaign; and I infer, as the information could be 
obtained only from some one of the members of the cabinet, and as Mr. 
Forsyth was not one, and, as far as I am informed, not particularly intimate 
with any of its members, except Mr. Crawford, that the object of your request was to obtain the information through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a> from Mr. Crawford, and that, consequently, in writing to him, and in placing the copy of 
his letter in your hand, he can be regarded in no other light but that of your agent 
</p><p>
Under this new aspect of this affair, I conceive that I have the right to 
claim of you to be put in possession of all the additional information, which 
I might fairly have demanded of Mr. Forsyth, had the correspondence been 
originally between him and myself, on the supposition on which I acted previously to the receipt of his letter. He avows himself ready, if desired by 
me, to furnish me with the additional information; but a sense of propriety 
would not permit me to make the request of him. Considered as your 
agent in this affair, it is not for me to make the request of information of 
him. What additional information I conceive myself to be entitled to, my 
letter -to you of the 29th May will sufficiently indicate. A part of the 
information, it seems from Mr. Forsyth's letter, is already in your possession, and there can be no doubt but the whole would be furnished at your 
request. 
</p><p>
I make this application solely from the desire of obtaining the means of 
enabling me to unravel this mysterious affair. Facts and circumstances, 
light of themselves, may, when viewed in connexion, afford important light 
as to the origin and object of what I firmly believe to be a base political intrigue, got up by those who regard your reputation and the public interest 
much less than their own personal advancement. 
</p><p>
I must remark, in conclusion, that the letter of Mr. Forsyth affords to my 
mind conclusive proof that the intimations to my prejudice, to which you 
refer in your letter of the 30th ultimo, and which you seem to think made 
no impression on jour mind, have not been without their intended effect. 
On no other supposition can I explain the fact, that, without giving me any 
intimation of the step, you should apply for information, as to my course 
in the cabinet, to one whom you knew to be hostile to me as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> is, and who could not, as you know, make the disclosure consistently 
with the principles of honor and fidelity, when my previous correspondence 
with you ought o have satisfied you that I was prepared to give you, frankly 
and fully, any information which you might desire, in relation to my course 
on the occasion.
