My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I have received with exceeding great satisfaction and pleasure your favor of the 18th of April, and am extremely rejoiced to learn, that the spirit of discontent 
had so entirely subsided, and that the parade of desertion would probably be totally stopped among the troops under your command. The measures you had 
taken to obtain, on your own credit, a supply of clothing and necessaries for the detachment, must entitle you to all their gratitude and affection ; and will, at the 
same time that it endears your name, if possible, still 
more to this country, be an everlasting monument of 
your ardent zeal and attachment to its cause, and the 
establishment of its independence. For my own part, 
my dear Marquis, although I stood in need of no new 
proofs of your exertions and sacrifices in the cause of 
America, I will confess to you, that I shall not be able 
to express the pleasing sensations I have experienced 
at your unparalleled and repeated instances of generosity and zeal for the service on every occasion. Suffer me only to pursue you with my sincerest wishes, 
that your success and glory may always be equal to 
your merits. 
</p><p>
I was troubled to be informed of the loss of your 
baggage, but am happy to find, that your private and 
interesting papers were not with it. Should the map of the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, with remarks made on it 
by the pilots, not have been lost, I could wish you would 
be so obliging as to forward it or a copy to me by some 
safe conveyance, as it may be eventually advantageous 
to have it here. Colonel Tupper, who goes to relieve 
Colonel Vose, will have the honor to deliver this letter 
to you. I am, &c. 
</p>
