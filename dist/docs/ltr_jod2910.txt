WE have now an ample representation from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. It consists of six delegates, and they are to all 
appearance as high, as decisive, and as determined as any men ever were or can be. There is a new 
hand, a Mr. Duer,who is a very fine fellow, a man of sense, spirit and activity, and is exceeded by no man 
in zeal. Mr. Duane and Mr. Philip Livingston are apparently as determined as any men in Congress. 
You will see, by the enclosed newspapers, that Duane and Jay have arrived at the honor of being ranked 
with the two Adamses. I hope they will be duly sensible of the illustrious distinction and be sure to be have in a manner becoming it.

This is the anniversary of the ever memorable 19th April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. Two complete years we have maintained open war with Great Britain and her allies, and 
after all our difficulties and misfortunes, are much abler to cope with them now than we were at the beginning.
