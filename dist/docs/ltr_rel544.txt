  Lt.-Col. Albert Ordway, Provost Marshal, Department of Virginia.
</p><p>
Colonel:  I propose establishing my family next week in Cumberland
County, Virginia, near Cartersville, on the James River canal.  On
announcing my intention to General Patrick, when he was on duty in
Richmond, he stated that no passport for the purpose was necessary.
Should there have been any change in the orders of the Department
rendering passports necessary, I request that I may be furnished
with them.  My son, G. W. Custis Lee, a paroled prisoner with myself,
will accompany me.  Very respectfully your obedient servant,
</p>
