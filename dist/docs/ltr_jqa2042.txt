THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, November 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Under the present circumstances of affairs in this country, 
I did not think it prudent to make any unnecessary delay 
in England, and accordingly left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> of the 28th of last 
month. Our passage to Helvoet was short though not 
agreeable, the packet being very much crowded with 
passengers. We were only three days from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> to this 
place. 
</p><p>
I had been told in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> that I should perceive fewer 
symptoms of war in this country than I should leave behind 
me there ; but I had no idea of finding everything so perfectly quiet as it is. Excepting the course of conversation 
in company, you would imagine yourself to be in a land 
blessed with a profound peace. No confusion, no agitation, 
no aggregations in the streets, no appearance of exertion. 
I had almost said no symptom from any part of the people 
of feeling an interest in the fate of their country. You 
remember, Sir, how feeble the efforts of this people were 
when their war broke out with England in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1781">1781</a>. Yet at 
that time the active spirit of liberty predominated. Patriot 
ism was the popular idol, and the power which upon the 
whole governed the country rested much for its support 
upon the motives of public spirit. But now that the reins 
of government are held by a power, professedly founded 
upon mere force, a power which has always been at war with public spirit and considered patriotism as its deadly enemy, 
which has always dreaded enthusiasm and discountenanced 
the amour sacre de la patrie, you may judge what a state of 
lifeless imbecility characterizes the people, even at a moment 
so full of danger and dismay as the present. 
</p><p>
The Government meets with no internal resistance. The 
appearance of opposition lately made at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, has 
been completely crushed, and the petitioners have tamely 
delivered up their arms at command. Van Staphorst has 
fled, and is safe at Hamburg. Visscher is in close confinement, and patriotism is again compelled to hide its head. 
This people I fear have lost that energy of character which 
once so honourably distinguished them. Had there been 
a common share of spirit displayed by the petitioners at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, the consequences I am informed would have 
been extremely different; but it was a struggle between 
weakness and impotence, in which the former can scarcely 
be said to have obtained the victory, though the latter was 
certainly defeated. 
</p><p>
But passive obedience and non-resistance are one thing; 
and the warm, animated zeal, which is necessary for the defence of an invaded country, the dauntless heart and the 
nervous arm, which inspired and directed by the enthusiasm 
of liberty have heretofore performed miracles for the salvation 
of this as well as of other countries, are another. The strength 
of the government is sufficient to control the inclinations of 
their adversaries within their walls, but it can hope nothing 
from their assistance. It can paralyze their limbs, but cannot 
arm them in its defence. 
</p><p>
They have to contend with enemies of a very different 
description, with armies powerful in numbers, under the 
most perfect discipline, of uncontrolable impetuosity, and 
who pursue to the utmost every advantage they obtain. 
</p><p>
There is another circumstance which has added to the 
extreme debility which has characterized the defence of their 
frontier against the present invasion. The length of time 
elapsed since this country has been before engaged in a war 
by land has removed all the officers of martial experience 
from their troops, but especially from the command of their 
fortified towns. The usual system of patronage and protection has conferred most of these places as sinecures upon 
favorites, and in the distribution of the places military merit 
has been deemed the most unnecessary and useless of all 
qualifications in the officer to be provided for. The benefit 
of the individual was the only consideration of importance, 
for as to the service required, where is the cowardice or 
stupidity that can be inadequate to the mere parade of a 
military government in time of peace? 
</p><p>
But however suitable the post may be to the officer in 
peace, it seems the officer turns out very unsuitable to 
the post in war. So that when the day of trial comes, one 
commander resigns on account of his health ; another finds 
himself incapable to maintain his station from his old age. 
A third contrives means to be disgusted at some paltry pretence for taking offence ; and a fourth without ceremony 
surrenders as soon as his command is invested. I am told 
that all these things have really happened, and the most 
bitter execrations are vented against the Prince of Hesse, 
the late governor of Bois le Due, for capitulating as he did. 
Treachery and cowardice are both very liberally imputed 
to him by the partisans of this government, but I know not 
with how much foundation. A momentary popular odium 
is very often the lot of the best officer when unfortunate, 
and at such a point of time the voice of the people is far 
from being infallible. . . . 
</p><p>
It is to me a new thing under the sun, to see a people anxious to be conquered, and praying for the success of their 
enemies ; though not indeed in the spirit of Christian humility. This phenomenon now discovers itself more and 
more to my view. Since my arrival here the intelligence 
has been generally unfavorable to the allies. The king of 
Prussia's peace is ascertained. Maestricht has capitulated, 
and Nimeguen is severely bombarded ; at each of these 
several articles of news I have seen more than one Dutch 
man's eyes sparkle with pleasure, and I have observed countenances to fall at the transient rumors of successful sallies 
from both those towns, which have been invented and propagated to cheer the sinking spirits of the Orange party. . . .
