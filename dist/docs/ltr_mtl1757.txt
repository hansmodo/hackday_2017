W. H. BEADY, ESQ. : My great, great sorrow and loss have made me painfully sensitive, but as my feelings and pecuniary comforts 
were never regarded or even recognized in the midst of my overwhelming bereavement now 
that I am pressed in a most startling manner for means of subsistence, I do not know why I 
should shrink from an opportunity of improving my trying position. 
</p><p>
Being assured that all you do will be appropriately executed, and in a manner that will not 
startle me very greatly, and excite as little comment as possible, again I shall leave all in your hands. 
</p><p>
I am passing through a very painful ordeal, which the country, in remembrance of my noble and devoted husband, should have spared me. 
</p><p>
I remain, with great respect, very truly, 
</p><p>

P. S. As you mention that my goods have been valued at over $24,000, I will be willing to 
make a reduction of $8,000, and relinquish them for $16,000. If this is not accomplished, I will 
continue to sell and -advertise largely until every article is sold. 
</p><p>
I must have means to live, at least in a medium comfortable state.
