<a rel='month origin' value='7'>July</a> <a rel='day origin' value='7'>7th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=fauquier white sulphur springs' rel='city origin'>Fauquier White Sulphur Springs</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. This water is making us young again. How these men enjoy the baths. They say <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> can stop 
the way with sixty thousand: that many are coming.

An antique female, with every hair curled and frizzed, said to be a Yankee spy, sits opposite us. Brewster solemnly wondered " with eternity and the judgment to come 
so near at hand., how she could waste her few remaining minutes curling her hair." He bade me be very polite, for 
she would ask me questions. When we were walking away from table, I demanded his approval of my self-control 
under such trying circumstances. It seems I was not as calm and forbearing as I thought myself. Brewster answered with emphasis: " Do you always carry brickbats like that in your pocket ready for the first word that of 
fends you ? You must not do so, when you are with spies from the other side." I do not feel at all afraid of spies 
hearing anything through me, for I do not know anything.

But our men could not tarry with us in these cool shades and comfortable quarters, with water unlimited, excellent table, etc. They have gone back to Manassas, and the faithful Brewster with them to bring us the latest news. 
They left us in excellent spirits, which we shared until they were out of sight. We went with them to Warrenton, and 
then heard that <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>General Johnston</a> was in full retreat, and that a column was advancing upon <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a>. So we 
came back, all forlorn. If our husbands are taken prisoners, what will they do with them? Are they soldiers or traitors ? 
</p><p>
Mrs. Ould read us a letter from Richmond. How horrified they are there at <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston's</a> retreating. And the 
enemies of the War Department accuse <a href='/results.php?tla=lew' rel=''>Walker</a> of not sending <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>General Johnston</a> ammunition in sufficient quantities; 
say that is the real cause of his retreat. Now will they not make the ears of that slow-coach, the Secretary of War, buzz? 
</p><p>
Mrs. Preston's maid Maria has a way of rushing in " Don't you hear the cannon? " We fly to the windows, 
lean out to our waists, pull all the hair away from our ears, but can not hear it. <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> wants four hundred millions 
of money and men in proportion. Can he get them? He will find us a heavy handful. Midnight. I hear Maria's guns. 
</p><p>
We are always picking up some good thing of the rough Illinoisan's saying. <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> objects to some man " Oh, 
he is too interruptions "; that is a horrid style of man or woman, the inter ruptious. I know the thing, but had no 
name for it before.
