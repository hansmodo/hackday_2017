SIR, 
</p><p>
By inquiry, I have learned that General Patterson's brigade, which is the one you propose to send, is by far the 
weakest of the three now here, and does not consist of more 
than about six hundred rank and file fit for duty. It is 
true, that there is a militia regiment with it of about two 
hundred, but the time of service for which this regiment is 
engaged is so near expiring, that it would be past by the 
time the men could arrive at their destination. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, I cannot consider it either as 
compatible with the good of the service, or my instructions 
from his excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>, to consent that 
that brigade be selected from the three to go to him, but I 
am under the necessity of desiring, by virtue of my orders 
from him, that one of the others be substituted instead of 
this, either General Nixon's or General Glover's, and that 
you will be pleased to give immediate orders for its embarkation. 
</p><p>
Knowing that <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> wished me to pay the 
greatest deference to your judgment, I ventured so far to 
deviate from the instructions he gave me, as to consent, in 
compliance with your opinion, that two brigades should 
remain here instead of one. At the same time, permit me 
to observe, that I am not myself sensible of the expediency 
of keeping more than one, with the detached regiments in 
the neighbourhood of this place, and that my ideas coincide 
with those gentlemen whom I have consulted on the occasion, whose judgment I have much more reliance upon than 
on my own, and who must be supposed to have a thorough 
knowledge of all the circumstances. Their opinion is, that 
one brigade and the regiments before mentioned would 
amply answer the purposes of this post. When I preferred your opinion to other considerations, I did not imagine 
you would pitch upon a brigade little more than half as 
large as the others, and finding this to be the case, I indispensably owe it to my duty to desire, in his excellency's 
name, that another may go instead of the one intended, and 
without loss of time. As it may be conducive to despatch 
to send Glover's brigade, if agreeable to you, you will give 
orders accordingly.
