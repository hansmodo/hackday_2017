GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
My anxiety for the fate of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> induces me to request, 
that you will exert yourselves among the inhabitants to prevail 
on them to enter into such measures as will prevent the necessity of opening my batteries on the town. When I consider the 
dreadful consequences of a bombardment, the distress that must 
attend a fire (at this season especially), when it is too late to repair the damage which must ensue, how many innocent people 
must suffer, and that the firm friends of liberty must be involved in one common ruin with the wicked tools of despot 
ism, my heart bleeds at the dire necessity which compels me 
to distress that unfortunate city. I conjure you, by all the ties 
of humanity, to take every possible step to soften the heart of 
the Governor, who, if he be sincere in his professions to the 
people committed to his charge, must commiserate their condition. In vain will he persist in a resistance, which can only 
be attended with misery to the inhabitants and with lasting Disgrace to his own humanity. I am, gentlemen, with earnest 
wishes for the success of your negotiation, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. I have just heard it has been falsely and scandalously 
reported that our intentions are to plunder the inhabitants. I 
have only to appeal to your own observation, whether such a 
proceeding be consistent with our conduct since we have entered this Province.
