Consulship of the United States,<br>
<a href='/results.php?city=monterey' rel='city origin'>Monterey</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="3">March</a> 	<a rel='day origin' value='10'>10</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1846' rel="origin">1846</a>. 
</p><p>
My Dear Sir : I am ignorant if it would meet with the approbation of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a>, that I should permit, that of the note which he wrote 
with so much precipitation, the translation should be made which you solicit. But since it pleases you to allow that my courier should pass to the 
encampment of said officer, and trusting that the contents of the said note will contribute to calm the minds, and preserve harmony, I consent that the translation which you wish may be made. 
</p><p>
Perhaps the authorities have conceived suspicions in relation to my person, considering the difficulty of the circumstance', being Consul of the United States, but I cannot remedy it. Nevertheless, you may know 
that verbally I have offered my services, always when I have judged them in any manner useful, the same as now I am lending them by writing. <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> has his particular instructions, which it is 
not one of the attributes of this consulship to alter, nevertheless I will do as much as may be reconcilable with my functions to avoid any conflict whatever. 
</p><p>
It only remains for me to ask you respectfully, that when you write today to the General, that you make known to him on my part, that I take 
the liberty to propose to him that before proceeding to extremities, he will please to address a communication to <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a>, in which he shall 
ask of him an hour's interview. I am in the firm belief that there will be a copious effusion of blood, if the officer in question is attacked, and there 
would result from a step of such a nature, not only, that many lives would 
be lost on both sides, but it would be the origin of great expenses, considerable damages, and perhaps a greater flow of blood in the future, between 
the citizens of our respective nations. Finally, intimately convinced I am, that forcible measures will not produce a single good, but evils of great magnitude now and in the time to come. 
</p><p>
I have powerful motives for believing that <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> yet remains where he is, with the sole end of affording his horses some rest (since he 
has already bought his provisions), and immediately afterwards, he will go out of the Department of California. But he cannot verify this, inasmuch 
as he sees himself surrounded by people in whom he observes decided intentions of hostility. 
</p><p>
I beg you to send a copy of this note to the <a href="/results.php?tla=jsc" rel="adversary">Commandant General D. jose Castro</a>, and I have the honor to subscribe myself with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
(Signed) <a href="/results.php?tla=tol" rel="me">Thomas O. Larkin</a>. 
</p><p>
To Don Manuel Diaz, Alcalde of Monterey. 
</p><p>
Captain Fremont : I direct this with the correspondence of the Alcalde to the General, I know not, if it will arrive or not in your possession. By the Blacksmith Joseph who formerly belonged to that Company 
under your command, I remit the original of the letter that I received.
