<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=chester' rel='city origin'>CHESTER</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Just now, when Mr. Clay dashed up-stairs, pale as a sheet, saying, " <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a> has capitulated," I 
saw it reflected in Mary Darby's face before I heard him speak. She staggered to the table, sat down, and wept 
aloud. Mr. Clay's eyes were not dry. Quite beside her self Mary shrieked, " Now we belong to negroes and Yankees ! Buck said, I do not believe it.

How different from ours of them is their estimate of us. How contradictory is their attitude toward us. To keep the 
despised and iniquitous South within their borders, as part of their country, they are willing to enlist millions of men 
at home and abroad, and to spend billions, and we know they do not love fighting per se, nor spending money. They 
are perfectly willing to have three killed for our one. We hear they have all grown rich, through "shoddy", whatever 
that is. Genuine Yankees can make a fortune trading jack-knives.

"Somehow it is borne in on me that we will have to pay the piper, was remarked to-day. No ; blood can not be 
squeezed from a turnip. You can not pour anything out of an empty cup. We have no money even for taxes or to 
be confiscated. "

While the Preston girls are here, my dining-room is given up to them, and we camp on the landing, with our one 
table and six chairs. Beds are made on the dining-room floor. Otherwise there is no furniture, except buckets of 
water and bath-tubs in their improvised chamber. Night and day this landing and these steps are crowded with the 
Elite of the Confederacy, going and coming, and when night comes, or rather, bedtime, more beds are made on the floor 
of the landing-place for the war-worn soldiers to rest upon. The whole house is a bivouac. As Pickens said of South 
Carolina in 1861, we are " an armed camp."

My husband is rarely at home. I sleep with the girls, and my room is given up to soldiers. <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee's</a> few, 
but undismayed, his remnant of an army, or the part from the South and West, sad and crestfallen, pass through 
Chester. Many discomfited heroes find their way up these stairs. They say <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston</a> will not be caught as <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> was. 
He can retreat; that is his trade. If he would not fight <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> in the hill country of Georgia, what will he do 
but retreat in the plains of North Carolina with <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a>, and Thomas all to the fore ?

We are to stay here. Running is useless now; so we mean to bide a Yankee raid, which they say is imminent. 
Why fly? They are everywhere, these Yankees, like red ants, like the locusts and frogs which were the plagues of Egypt. 
</p><p>
The plucky way in which our men keep up is beyond praise. There is no howling, and our poverty is made a 
matter of laughing. We deride our own penury. Of the country we try not to speak at all.
