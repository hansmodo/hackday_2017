<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, Dec. 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1860">1860</a>. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen: Your note of the 15th inst., inviting me 
to attend a public dinner in your city, on Friday evening 
next, was duly received. 
</p><p>
I remember with pleasure the kindness shown me 
during the recent canvass by our political friends at 
Philadelphia, and would gladly avail myself of the proposed celebration, to mingle my personal thanks with 
your rejoicings over the recent triumph of our political 
principles. Other engagements and duties, however, will 
not allow me that pleasure. 
</p><p>
No State can dispute with Pennsylvania the honor of 
this triumph. Her own son was upon trial, and her 
voice of condemnation was emphatic and decisive. The 
election of Governor Curtin foreshadowed her decision, 
and strengthened our cause in every State where freedom 
of election is allowed to the people. Her verdict in 
November reconsidered and reaffirmed her verdict in 
October. And now, since the victory is won, let us not 
lose the fruits of it. 
</p><p>
Fidelity to principle is demanded by the highest patriotism. The question is not whether this or that policy 
should prevail, but whether we shall allow the Government to be broken into fragments, by disappointed partisans, condemned by four-fifths of the people. It is the 
same question answered by General Jackson in his proclamation of 1833. It is the same question answered by 
Henry Clay in the Senate in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1850">1850</a>. It is the same question answered by Madison and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="">Jefferson</a>, and recently by 
Wade and Johnson. It is a question which, I feel 
assured, every one of you will answer, in the patriotic 
language of General Jackson " The Union, it must be 
preserved." 
</p><p>
Such would be the voice of the whole country, if the 
Government was not now administered by those who not 
only permit treason but actually commit it, by turning 
the powers of the Government against itself. They kill 
the Government they have sworn to maintain and defend, 
because the people, whose agents they are, have condemned them. In this spirit we have seen a Secretary 
of the Treasury, charged with the financial credit of the 
Government, offering for sale the bonds of the Government, and at the same moment declaring that it will be 
overthrown, and that he would aid in overthrowing it. 
We see other high officers receiving PAY for services to 
the Government and yet, at the same moment, plotting its 
destruction. We see the Treasury robbed by subordinate 
officers amid the general ruin. Stranger still, we see the 
President of the United States acknowledging his duty 
to execute the laws, but refusing to execute them. He 
admits that the Constitution is the supreme law; that 
neither a State nor the citizens of a State can disregard 
it ; and yet, armed as he is with all the executive power, 
I he refuses even to protect the property of the United 
States against armed violence. He will not hear General 
Cass, the head of his cabinet. He will not heed General 
Scott, the head of the army. He has transferred to 
Southern States more than one hundred thousand arms, 
of the newest pattern and most effective calibre, to be 
turned against the Government. 
</p><p>
The American people are now trembling with apprehension lest the President allows our officers and soldiers 
to be slaughtered at their posts for want of the aid which 
he has refused, or what is far more disgraceful, shall 
order the flag of the Union to be lowered without resistance to lawless force. 
</p><p>
Treason sits in the councils, and timidity controls the 
executive power. The President listens to, and is controlled by threats. He theorizes about coercing a State 
when he should be enforcing the laws against rebellious 
citizens. He admits that the States have surrendered 
the power to make treaties, coin money and regulate 
commerce, and yet we will probably have the novel and 
ridiculous farce of a negotiation between the President 
and a State for the surrender of forts and arsenals and 
sovereignty. Congress can do nothing, for the laws now 
are sufficient, if executed. Impeachment is too slow a 
remedy. The Constitution provided against every probable vacancy in the office of President, but did not provide for utter imbecility. 
</p><p>
The people, alarmed, excited, yet true to the Union 
and the Constitution, are watching with eager fear, lest 
the noble Government, baptized in the blood of the Ee volution, shall be broken into fragments, before the President elect shall assume the functions of his office. 
</p><p>
What pretext is given for this alarming condition of 
affairs? for every treasonable act has its pretext. We 
are told that the people of the Southern States apprehend 
that Mr. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Lincoln</a> will deprive them of their constitutional 
rights. It is not claimed that, as yet, their rights have 
been invaded, but upon an apprehension of evil, they will 
break up the most prosperous Government the providence 
of God ever allowed to man. 
</p><p>
We know very well how groundless are their apprehensions, but we are not even allowed to say so to our fellowcitizens of the South. So wild is their apprehension, that 
even such statesmen as Stephens, Johnson, Hill, Botts, 
and Pettigrew, when they say, "wait, wait, till we see 
what this ^Republican party will attempt," are denounced 
as Abolitionists, Submissionists. You know very well 
that we do not propose to interfere in the slightest degree 
with slavery in the States. We know that our leader, 
for whose election you rejoice, has, over and over again, 
affirmed his opposition to the abolition of slavery in the 
District of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a>, except upon conditions that are not 
likely to occur ; to any interference with the inter-State 
slave trade ; and that he will enforce the constitutional 
right of the citizens of the slave States to recapture their 
fugitive slaves when they escape from service into the 
free States. We know very well that the great objects 
which those who elected Mr. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Lincoln</a> expect him to accomplish will be to secure to free labor its just right to 
the Territories of the United States ; to protect, as far as 
practicable, by wise revenue laws, the labor of our people ; 
to secure the public lands to actual settlers, instead of to 
non-resident speculators ; to develop the internal resources 
of the country by opening new means of communication 
between the Atlantic and the Pacific, and to purify the 
administration of the Government from the pernicious 
influences of jobs, contracts and unreasonable party 
warfare. 
</p><p>
But, some of you may say, all this is very well, but 
what will you do to save the Union? Why don't you 
compromise ? 
</p><p>
Gentlemen, remember that we are just recovering from 
the dishonor of breaking a legislative compromise. We 
have been struggling, against all the powers of the Government, for six years, to secure practically what was 
expressly granted by a compromise. We have succeeded. 
Kansas is now free. The Missouri restriction is now 
practically restored by the incipient Constitution of 
Kansas, and safer yet by the will of her people. The 
baptism of strife through which she has passed has only 
strengthened the prohibition. There let it stand. 
</p><p>
But, our political opponents, who have dishonored the 
word " compromise," who trampled, without a moment's 
hesitation, upon a compromise, when they expected to 
gain by it, now ask us to again compromise by securing 
slavery south of a geographical line. To this we might 
fairly say: There is no occasion for compromise. We 
have done no wrong; we have no apologies to make, and 
no concessions to offer. You chose your ground, and we 
accepted your issue. We have beaten you, and you must 
submit, as we have done in the past, and as we should 
have done if the voice of the people had been against us. 
As good citizens you must obey the laws, and respect the 
constituted authorities. But we will meet new questions 
of administration with a liberal spirit. Without surrendering our convictions in the least, we may now dispose 
of the whole Territorial controversy by the exercise of 
unquestioned Congressional power. 
</p><p>
The only Territory, south of the line, except that 
which, by treaty with Indian tribes, cannot be included 
within the jurisdiction of a State, is New Mexico. She 
has now population enough for admission as a State. 
Let Congress admit her as a State, and then she has the 
acknowledged right to form, regulate, change or modify 
her domestic institutions. She has now a nominal slave 
code framed, and urged upon her by Territorial officers. 
Practically, slavery does not exist there. It never can 
be established there. In a region where the earth yields 
her increase only by the practice of irrigation, slave labor 
will not be employed. At any rate, it is better to settle 
all questions about slavery there, by admitting the Territory as a State. While a Territory, it is insisted that 
slavery shall be protected in it. We insist that Congress 
may prohibit it ; and that the people have an undisputed 
right to exclude slaves. Why not, by terminating their 
Territorial condition, determine this controversy ? The 
same course might now properly be adopted with all the 
Territories of the United States. 
</p><p>
In each of the Territories there are now small settlements scattered along the lines of transit. Within five 
years, the least populous will contain sufficient population for a representative in Congress. Dacotah, Washington, Nevada and Jefferson are destined soon to be as 
familiar to us as Kansas and Nebraska. It is well worthy 
the consideration of the old States, whether it is not 
better to dispense with all Territorial organizations 
always expensive and turbulent and, at once, to carve 
the whole into States of convenient size for admission. 
This was the Jeffersonian plan, which did not contemplate Territories, but States. It was also sanctioned by 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>, and, but for his death, would have been 
adopted. 
</p><p>
This is an easy, effectual remedy, within the power of 
Congress, and in its nature an irrevocable act. There is 
no necessity of an amendment to the Constitution. It 
is not at all probable that two-thirds of both Houses of 
Congress and three-fourths of the States can agree to any 
amendments. Why attempt it, unless to invite new 
conquests, new acquisitions, to again arouse sectional 
animosities? We know that if Mexico is acquired, the 
South will demand it for slavery, and the North for free 
institutions. We must forego, for the present, new conquests, unless the love of acquisition is stronger than the 
love of domestic peace. 
</p><p>
Suppose it to be conceded that the Constitution should 
be amended, what amendment will satisfy the South? 
Nothing less than the protection of slavery in the Territories. But our people have pronounced against it. All 
who voted for Mr. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Lincoln</a> or Mr. Douglas over three 
million three hundred thousand citizens voted against 
this claim. Less than a million voted for it. Should the 
great majority yield to a meagre minority, especially 
under threats of disunion ? This minority demand that 
slavery be protected by the Constitution. Our fathers 
would not allow the word " slave " or " slavery " in the 
Constitution, when all the States but one were slaveholding. Shall we introduce these words when a majority of the States are free, and when the progress of 
civilization has arrayed the world against slavery? If 
the love of peace, and ease, and office, should tempt politicians and merchants to do it, the people will rebel. I 
assure you, whatever may be the consequence, they will 
not yield their moral convictions by strengthening the 
influence of slavery in this country. Recent events have 
only deepened this feeling. The struggle to establish 
slavery in Kansas ; the frequent murders and mobbings, 
in the South, of Northern citizens; the present turbulence and violence of Southern society ; the manifest fear 
of the freedom of speech and of the press ; the danger of 
insurrection ; and now the attempt to subvert the Government rather than submit to a constitutional election 
these events, disguise it as you may, have aroused a 
counter irritation in the North that will not allow its 
Representatives to yield, merely for peace, more than is 
prescribed by the letter and spirit of the Constitution. 
Every guarantee of this instrument ought to be faithfully 
and religiously observed. But when it is proposed to 
change it, to secure new guarantees to slavery, to extend 
and protect it, you awake and arouse the anti-slavery 
feeling of the North to war against slavery everywhere. 
</p><p>
I am, therefore, opposed to any change in the Constitution, and to any compromise that will surrender any of 
the principles sanctioned by the people in the recent contest. If the personal-liberty bills of any State infringe 
upon the Constitution, they should at once be repealed. 
Most of them have slumbered upon the Statute-book for 
years. They are now seized upon by those who are plotting disunion as a pretext. We should give them no 
pretext. It is always right and proper for each State to 
apply to State laws the test of the Constitution. 
</p><p>
It is a remarkable fact that none of the border free 
States New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, nor Iowa have any such upon their Statute-books. 
The laws of these States against kidnapping are similar 
to those of Virginia and Kentucky. The laws of other 
States, so called, have never operated to release a single 
fugitive slave, and may be regarded simply as a protest 
of those States against the harsh features of the fugitiveslave law. So far as they infringe upon the Constitution, 
or impair, in the' least, a constitutional right, they are 
void and ought to be repealed. 
</p><p>
I venture the assertion, jthat there have been more 
cases of kidnapping of free negroes, in Ohio, than of 
peaceable or unlawful rescue of fugitive slaves in the 
whole United States. It has been shown that the law 
of recapture and the penalties of rescue have been almost 
invariably executed. Count up all the cases of rescue of 
negroes in the North, and you can find in your newspapers more cases of unlawful lynching and murder of 
j white men in the South. These cases have now become 
so frequent and atrocious, as to demand the attention of 
the General Government. The same article of the Constitution that secures the recapture of fugitives from 
service and justice also secures the rights of citizens of 
Pennsylvania and Ohio to all the immunities and privileges of citizens of the several States. No law has been 
passed by Congress to secure this constitutional right. 
No executive authority interposes to protect our citizens, 
and yet we hear no threats of retaliation or rebellion from 
Northern citizens or Northern States. So, I trust, it may 
ever be. 
</p><p>
The great danger that now overshadows us does not 
arise from real grievances. Plotters for disunion avail 
themselves of the weakness of the Executive to precipitate revolution. South Carolina has taken the lead. The 
movement would be utterly insignificant if confined to 
that State. She is still in the Union, and neither the 
President nor Congress has the power to consent to her 
withdrawal. This can only be by a change in the Constitution, or by the acquiescence of the people of the 
other States. The defence of the property of the United 
States and the collection of the revenues need not cause 
the shedding of blood, unless she commences a contest of 
physical force. The increase, in one year, of our population is greater than her entire population, white and 
black. Either one of several Congressional districts in 
the West has more white inhabitants than she has. Her 
military power is crippled by the preponderance of her 
slaves. However brave, and gallant, and spirited her 
people may be, and no one disputes these traits, yet it 
is manifest she is weak in physical force. This great 
Government might well treat with indulgence paper 
secession, or the resolves of her Convention and Legislature, without invoking physical force to enforce the 
laws among her citizens. 
</p><p>
Without disrespect to South Carolina, it would be easy 
to show that Shays's rebellion and the whiskey insurrection involved the Government in greater danger than the 
solitary secession of South Carolina. But the movement 
becomes imposing when we are assured that several powerful States will very soon follow in the lead of South 
Carolina; and when we know that other States, still 
more powerful, sympathize with the seceding States, 
to the extent of opposing, and perhaps resisting, the 
execution of the laws in the seceding States. 
</p><p>
In this view of the present condition of public affairs 
it becomes the people of the United States seriously to 
consider whether the Government shall be arrested in 
the execution of its undisputed powers by the citizens 
of one or more States, or whether we shall test the 
power of the Government to defend itself against dissolution. Can a separation take place without war? If 
so, where will be the line? Who shall possess this 
magnificent capital, with all its evidences of progress 
and civilization? Shall the mouth of the Mississippi 
be separated from its sources ? Who shall possess the 
Territories ? Suppose these difficulties to be overcome ; 
suppose that in peace we should huckster and divide up 
our nationality, our flag, our history, all the recollections 
of the past ; suppose all these difficulties overcome, how 
can two rival Republics, of the same race of men, divided 
only by a line or a river for thousands of miles, with 
all the present difficulties aggravated by separation, avoid 
forays, disputes and war ? How can we travel our future 
march of progress in Mexico, or on the high seas, or on 
the Pacific slope, without collision? It is impossible. 
To peaceably accomplish such results, we must change 
the nature of man. Disunion is war! God knows, I 
do not threaten it, for I will seek to prevent it in every 
way possible. I speak but the logic of facts, which we 
should not conceal from each other. It is either hostilities between the Government and the seceding States ; 
or, if separation is yielded peaceably, it is a war of factions a rivalry of insignificant communities, hating 
each other, and contemned by the civilized world. If 
war results, what a war it will be ! Contemplate the 
North and South in hostile array against each other. 
If these sections do not know each other now, they will 
then. 
</p><p>
We are a nation of military men, naturally turbulent 
because we are free, accustomed to arms, ingenious, energetic, brave and strong. The same qualities that have enabled a single generation of men to develop the resources 
of a continent, would enable us to destroy more rapidly 
than we have constructed. It is idle for individuals of 
either section to suppose themselves superior in military 
power. The French and English tried that question for 
a thousand years. We ought to know it now. The result of the contest will not depend upon the first blow or 
the first year, but blood shed in civil war will yield its 
baleful fruits for generations. 
</p><p>
How can we avert a calamity at which humanity and 
civilization shudder? I know no way but to cling to 
the Government framed by our fathers, to administer it 
in a spirit of kindness, but in all cases, without partiality 
to enforce the laws. No State can release us from the 
duty of obeying the laws. The ordinance or act of a 
State is no defence for treason, nor does it lessen the 
moral guilt of that crime. Let us cling to each other in 
the hope that our differences will pass away, as they often 
have in times past. For the sake of peace, for the love 
of civil liberty, for the honor of our name, our race, our 
religion, let us preserve the Union, loving it better as the 
clouds grow darker. I am willing to unite with any man, 
whatever may have been his party relations, whatever 
may be his views of the existing differences, who is willing to rely on the Constitution as it is for his rights, and 
who is willing to maintain and defend the Union under 
all circumstances, against all enemies, at home or abroad. 
</p><p>
Pardon me, gentlemen, for writing you so fully. I feel 
restrained, by the custom of the House of Representatives, from engaging there in political debate ; and yet I 
feel it is the duty of every citizen to prepare his countrymen for grave events, that will test the strength and integrity of the Government. 
</p><p>
Believing that our only safety is in a firm enforcement of the laws, and that Mr. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Lincoln</a> will execute that 
duty without partiality, I join my hearty congratulations 
with yours that he is so soon to be the President of the 
United States. With great respect, I remain, very truly 
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
