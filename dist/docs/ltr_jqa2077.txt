TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE

No. 43 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, June 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Previous to the revolution which happened in this country 
in the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>, in most of the cities and villages throughout 
the provinces certain clubs or popular societies had formed 
themselves, similar in their nature to those which have 
since then been so notorious in France, and to those which 
upon their model have recently arisen in the United States. 
After the victory of the Stadtholder over the patriotic 
party these societies were prohibited from assembling, and 
others, consisting only of the partizans of the House of 
Orange, were substituted in their stead. Since the arrival of 
the French armies in Holland and the revolution consequent 
upon that event, the Orange societies have been prohibited 
in their turn, and the patriotic clubs have been revived. 
</p><p>
The only qualification requisite to make any person eligible 
as a member of these clubs is that of being an unequivocal 
partizan. They are composed, therefore, of people in every 
different situation of society, and are very considerable in 
point of numbers. It has been indeed considered as a sort of 
test to judge of the patriotism of every individual, and numbers of people become members of the clubs as they wear 
the cockade of the day, merely for the purpose of securing a 
guard against odium, and a protection from insult. 
</p><p>
Since the last revolution the persons vested with the 
powers of administration have observed uniformly towards the members of the ancient government, a system of 
moderation and of conciliation equally dictated by humanity 
and by policy. The same principle has been supported and 
promoted by the officers of the French government, civil 
and military, and has hitherto been attended with very 
good consequences. The principal opposition to this system 
has arisen from the popular societies, who in several of the 
large cities have passed resolves of a different complexion, 
and in some have peremptorily demanded of the present 
magistrates to adopt measures of remedy against the members of the former regencies. 
</p><p>
These ebullitions were in general contained within 
bounds until the conclusion of the alliance with France, 
partly by the exhortations of the present magistrates, and 
principally by the superintendence of the French Representatives and generals who, more than once, declared in the 
most positive terms that they would not suffer the execution 
of any arbitrary designs, and would protect all the members 
of the former government or others, against every attempt to 
persecute them without a specific accusation. 
</p><p>
The popular societies submitted, but did not acquiesce. 
On the I4th of this month, at Rotterdam, in consequence 
of a resolution taken at the society, a notification was dispersed throughout the city, inviting all true patriots to 
assemble together in a public place assigned at a certain hour of that day. 
</p><p>
The meeting was numerous to the amount of several 
thousands. They deliberated, they resolved and finally 
determined to go in a body to the house where the municipality was assembled, and s^nd a deputation to them, demanding in the name of the people that all the members of the 
former Regency be put under arrest in their houses. That 
the former High Officer be confined in close prison, that all 
the subaltern officers of the Orange party still in employment be immediately dismissed and others appointed on 
their stead, true Patriots and such as should be agreeable to the people. 
</p><p>
The Council of the municipality refused at first to comply with these demands, assigning as their reasons for this 
refusal that the citizens had not been legally assembled, 
and their deputation could not therefore be considered as 
expressing the voice of the people; and further that, as the 
deputation alleged no cause whatever for the arrest of 
the former Regents and High Officer, the demand could not 
be complied with but by a violation of the rights of men and 
citizens, rights which they, the members of the municipality, 
had promised before God and their fellow citizens to support, 
and one article of which was that "no man can rightfully 
be accused, arrested and imprisoned but in such cases and 
according to such formalities, as have previously been 
established by law." This answer was not satisfactory to 
the people who surrounded the State House, and the municipality were soon after compelled by the fear for their own 
lives to declare, that they were obliged to choose between ike circumstances and the law, and therefore adopted all the 
measures that had been thus dictated to them. 
</p><p>
The next day all the members of the municipality resigned their places, but have since consented to continue their 
functions until the Provincial Assembly shall have come to some determination relative to this transaction. The same 
collection of people afterwards appointed a committee, and sent them to the Provincial Assembly demanding: i. That 
one or more revolutionary tribunals be created for the purpose of revising the judicial decisions under the former 
government relative to political offences, and to indemnify the innocent for their injuries out of the property of the 
Regents at that time. 2. That all the former Regents of the Orange party be put under arrest; and 3. The 
dismission of all the partizans of the House of Orange from every species of public employment. 
</p><p>
On the 16 the Provincial Assembly appointed a committee to go to Rotterdam, and hold an amicable conference with the 
committee from the multitude that had assembled, and to endeavor to settle the affair in a satisfactory manner. 
The result of this conference was an arrangement, in consequence of which the members of the former Regency were 
dismissed from their arrest, giving the security of bonds to a 
large amount, and the people of the city were authorized 
to appoint a committee of vigilance to preserve the public peace and tranquility. Here the matter rests for the present. 
</p><p>
Something of a similar nature has occurred, it is said, in some other cities, and it is not improbable but the 
same spirit will discover itself with equal force at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. 
</p><p>
The generality of the party at present victorious have 
never been satisfied with the moderation that has been shown 
to the Regents and officers of the former government. 
Patriotism has considered them as offenders deserving 
punishment, private malice and resentment have viewed them 
as oppressors reduced to impotence, and therefore proper 
subjects of apprehension in their turn. Interest has looked 
only at their wealth, and supposed that it offered a just and 
plentiful supply to the present necessities of the country. 
These dispositions have been very much strengthened and 
increased by the conduct and conversation of the other party. 
The lenity they have experienced, instead of reconciling them to the new order of things, has only given them courage 
to hope to rail and to threaten. It is hardly conceivable 
with what imprudence they provoke severity, and bid 
defiance to a power certainly competent to ruin them. At 
the same time they are constantly feeding their own hopes 
with rumors, the credit of which rests upon no other foundation than their absurdity. A new revolution is so constantly 
the object of their wishes, that they grasp at everything 
true or false which can flatter their expectations. The 
impatience of their desires overleaps the bounds of space and 
time. They bring an English fleet upon the coast, or introduce a Prussian army into the heart of the country, with a 
facility more than practical, and, without waiting for an 
uncertain reality, they hasten to enjoy the triumph prepared for them with such rapidity that they have repeatedly 
stimulated their partisans among the populace to acts of riot and sedition, which it has been found necessary to punish. 
</p><p>
Such is the present state of the temper between the two 
great parties of this Republic. It is thought that it may be 
not altogether useless to have entered into some detail on the 
subject, because it may serve to give an idea of the public 
mind as it exists here at this time, and because it may indicate 
the probability of a material change in the system of internal 
policy in this Republic. The treatment of the members of 
the former government forms a part of an external system, 
and should the principles which have hitherto been pursued 
in this particular be abandoned, those which must be substituted in their stead would unquestionably have a very 
essential operation upon the aspect of affairs throughout their provinces. 
</p><p>
Please to accept the assurances, &c.
