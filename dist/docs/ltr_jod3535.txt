MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE children made me a visit to-day, and went with 
me to dine with my old friends, the two Abbes, whom 
you have often heard me mention, Chalut and Arnoux, who desire me to mention them to you in my 
letters as devoted friends of America, and particular 
friends to me and to you, notwithstanding the difference of religion. The children are still in good 
health and spirits, and well pleased with their academy. Ah ! how much pain have these young gentle men cost me within these three months ! The mountains, the cold, the mules, the houses without chimneys or windows, the will not add. I wish for 
</p><p>
a painter to draw me and my company mounted on muleback, or riding in the calashes, or walking, for we 
walked one third of the way. Yet by the help of 
constant care and expense, I have been able to get 
them all safe to Paris. The other moiety of the family is quite as near my heart, and therefore I hope 
they will never be ramblers. I am sick of rambling. 
If I could transport the other moiety of the family 
across the Atlantic with a wish, and be sure of returning them, when it should become necessary, in the 
same manner, how happy should I be ! 
</p><p>
I have been received here with much cordiality, and am daily visited by characters who do me much 
honor. Some day or other you will know, I believe, but I had better not say at present. Your friend, the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met acquaintance'>Comte D Estaing</a>, however, I ought to mention, because you have been acquainted with him. I have 
dined with him, and he has visited me and I him, and I hope to have many more conversations with him, 
for public reasons, not private, for on a private account great men and little are much alike to me. 
</p><p>
Mr. Lee and Mr. Izard are going home in the Alliance, and, I hope, will make you a visit. How 
many vicissitudes they are to experience, as well as 
I and all the rest of our countrymen, I know not. 
The events of politics are not less uncertain than those 
of war. Whatever they may be, I shall be content. 
Of one thing I am pretty sure, that if I return again 
safe to America, I shall be happy the remainder of 
my days, because I shall stay at home, and at home 
I must be to be happy. There is no improbability 
that I may be obliged to come home again soon, for 
want of means to stay here. I hope, however, care 
will be taken that something may be done to supply 
us. My tenderest affection to Abby and Tommy. 
They are better off than their brothers, after all. I 
have been taking measures to send home your things. 
I hope to succeed by the Alliance. It shall not be 
my fault, if I do not. If I cannot send by her, I will 
wait for another frigate, if it is a year, for I have no 
confidence in other vessels. 
</p><p>
Yours, forever yours.
