FOURTEEN MILES FROM <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">CINCINNATI</a>, 
August 28, 1845. 
</p><p>
I WRITE before reaching the city, as there I shall 
be entirely occupied in transporting our baggage 
to the river, a mile by land from the canal. Our 
journey has been exceedingly uncomfortable, the heat 
more oppressive than I ever knew it, and the mosquitoes in swarms at night. Whipple presented himself 
this morning as completely speckled as a plum pudding, and his face swelled out of all shape from the 
bites. I escaped this torment by having a mosquito 
bar, which Dr. Wood kindly lent me from the hospital. 
We have been detained two days by a break in the 
bank of the canal. The General [Brooke], Marcy, and 
Deas left us yesterday and rode to the city where we 
shall join them this evening. There are no orders for 
us at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">CINCINNATI</a>, but the news from Texas is such, 
that there can be but little doubt that we must be 
ordered almost immediately to that field. A letter 
from Lieutenant Beaman at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> states that 
General Paredes with seven thousand men is only one hundred and twenty miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>, who, 
if this be so, is in a very critical situation. General Gaines has made a requisition on the Governor of 
Louisiana for one thousand men to reenforce <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> if practicable. It seems to me seven years in 
stead of seven days since we parted, so tedious and 
lonely has been this canal route, though, for the last 
three days, passing through the finest country I have 
ever beheld.

P. S. On board transport " Plymouth " eleven 
o clock at night. 
</p><p>
I am almost tired out, have been on my feet in the 
hot sun on the rough pavements for eight hours, get 
ting my command embarked, but cannot go to bed 
until I close my sheet to you. On our arrival at two 
o clock today we found an order for the battalion to 
proceed immediately to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Corpus Christi" rel="city">Corpus Christi</a>, under my 
command. We shall probably reach Texas in about 
twelve days. Our companies are strengthened by 
fifty recruits from the rendezvous here. I shall have 
a very pretty command for a captain, and if there is 
anything to be done, I think I shall have a chance.
