The Cabinet met at the usual hour, all the members present. I stated fully to them the embarrassments to the government, and especially in the prosecution of the war, in consequence of the failure of Congress to act on the war measures which I have recommended. I stated to them that I was seriously considering of the propriety, and indeed the duty, of sending to Congress a message boldly and strongly appealing to Congress, and through them to the country, in favour of speedy action on my war measures. This I thought necessary to vindicate myself before the people and to throw the responsibility for the failure to act upon Congress. All the Cabinet approved the suggestion but Mr. Buchanan, who thought I had better postpone taking such a step until it was ascertained whether the bill to raise ten regiments of regular troops now before the Senate would pass. If that bill failed to pass, Mr. Buchanan was then decidedly in favour of my sending in such a message.
