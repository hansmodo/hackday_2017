</p><p>
HONOURED SIR, 
</p><p>
Mr. Thaxter and brother Charles wrote both to you the day before yesterday, and as I had no subject to write upon I did not write. But I can now give you an account of our journey. 
</p><p>
We dined on Monday at Haerlem, and arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=leyden" rel="city">Leyden</a> at six o clock. We lodged at the Cour de Hollande and saw Air. Waterhouse * that evening. The next day we went to 
hear a medicinal lecture by Professor Horn. W T e saw several experiments there. In the afternoon we went to hear a law lecture by Professor PesteL* Each lecture lasts an hour. 
</p><p>
Yesterday afternoon we moved from the Cour de Hollande to private lodgings in the same house in which Mr. Waterhouse 
boards. Our address is Mr. &c. by de Heer Welters, op de langc Burg, tegen over Mantel Huis, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=leyden" rel="city">Leyden</a>. 
</p><p>
I was to day in company with the parson of the brownist church, who seems to be a clever man. He is a scotch-man, but does not pray for the King of Kngland. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to have a pair of scates. They are of various prices, from guilders to ducats. Those of a ducat are as good as need to be, but I should like to know 
whether you would chusc to have me give so much. 
</p><p>
Mr. Waterhouse says that for riding I must have a pair leather breeches and a pair of boots. I should be glad if you would answer me upon that as soon as you receive this for 
there is a vacancy [vacation] here which begins tomorrow, and in the vacancy is the best time to begin to learn how to ride. 
</p><p>
In the vacancy there will be no lectures at all, but our Master will attend us all the while, as much as when there is no vacancy. 
</p><p>
I continue writing in Homer, the Greek grammar and Greek testament every day. I am your most dutiful son. 
</p><p>
