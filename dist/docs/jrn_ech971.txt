We left Pine Street Wharf, Philadelphia, on Tuesday evening, July 3d, amid the shouts and cheers of assembled hundreds and anchored below the Navy Yard until next morning. In order to complete some necessary repairs, we were detained in the Delaware River and Bay until Saturday afternoon , July 7th, when the steamer which towed us down the river left us at the Capes. After passing the breakwater we soon lost sight of land, and as the green hills and trees disappeared, a melancholy sensation seized upon us as we reflected that this might be the last time we would be permitted to gaze upon the beautiful hills and vales of our native land. This sensation soon wore away, however, as we came to look around and beheld nothing but the heaving ocean stretched out before us and the blue sky above. This, to one unaccustomed to the like, was a sight at once grand and imposing. Toward the end of the day, many of the passengers began to get seasick and I felt a little squeamish myself. I turned in, however, early and slept soundly until morning, when I too was seized with the prevailing epidemic.

My feelings and emotions on leaving my friends and my native land on such an expedition, I cannot describe. I have left all that is near and dear and turned my face towards a strange land, expecting to be absent two or
three years, hoping in that time to realize a fortune; and then return and be greeted by kind friends. And this hope is my greatest consolation and comfort. Often memory carries me back to the Record office, and were I of a desponding temperament, I should wish myself there again. But hope whispers all is well, and so I proceed with a strong arm and an honest heart, with bright anticipations of joy and happiness in the future. But why do I predict anything? Lofty castles have oft been built in the air and a single rude breath sufficed to level them to the earth.

The ship is owned and fitted out by G. W. Hathaway & Co., of Philadelphia. They advertised accommodations for first and second cabin passengers, the former at $200 and the latter at $160. Thirty of the passengers are members of the California Gold Mining Association of Philadelphia, of which I am one, as well as my friend, DeWitt Clinton Atkins. They are as merry a set of fellows as ever sailed. Our Association engaged 2d cabin passage with Mr. N. B. Finley, the agent of Hathaway & Co., and by him they were assured that they would be furnished the same fare as the first cabin passengers, and that the difference in price was made in consequence of the first cabin passengers being furnished with everything, while the lower cabin passengers furnished their own bedding and table furniture, and occupied the cabin between decks. A contract was drawn up enumerating the articles and quantity of food to be allowed each one in the lower cabin.
</p><p>
Our Association is divided into five sections. I am director of Section No. 5 which consists of six men. We each paid thirty dollars and purchased the following for use after arrival in San Francisco: 3 bbls. pilot bread, 2 do. pork, 1/2 do. beef, 1 do. beans, 1 do.
vinegar, one tent fourteen feet square, axe, hatchet, 2 spades, 2 shovels, 2 picks, 10 lbs. nails, pots, kettles, pans, table furniture, gum oversuit.

My personal outfit I bought with the money furnished me by Mr. Evans upon my departure. He is to receive fifty per cent of my earnings for two years after my arrival in California, in payment for the outfit as well as for six months' service which I owe him as apprentice. I have everything I can think of and over fifty dollars of my own in my pocket. As near as I can recollect at this time, the following comprises what I have brought with me: One government rifle, one navy pistol, one small rifle pistol, belt for same; six lbs. powder, six lbs. balls, 1,500 caps, large bowie knife, 17 pairs new heavy pantaloons, 12 new flannel shirts, 18 new checked shirts, five white muslin shirts, seven coats, five waistcoats, six new cotton neck cloths, 8 pairs of boots, shoes and slippers, four hats and caps, 18 pairs stockings, one nightcap, combs, brushes; ten lbs. of lead for casting bullets, six jars of pickles, one bottle of blackberry syrup, one lb. essence of beef, box of fresh water soap, do. of salt water, 3 lbs. of loaf sugar, peppermint, camphor, sulphur and brimstone, laudanum, twine, ropes, shaving apparatus, table knife, fork, spoon, plate, tin cup, iron frying pan, wash basin, etc.; a variety of books and stationery; bed and bedding, a bundle of rags and a box of all-healing salve.

Should I ever ship again I would take the following additional articles: Two or three dozen of mineral water, box of raisins, and a few other delicacies for use during seasickness. In addition to the articles mentioned in the foregoing list, I have taken a gallon of best fourth-proof brandy which I intend as medicine and for emergencies. We have given up to our Captain,
</p><p>
Addison Palmer, all our arms and ammunition for safekeeping. He seems to be a whole-souled sort of fellow.
</p><p>
We have about fifty-one passengers on board, among whom are six lady passengers, one little boy three years old and one infant at its mother's breast. Three of the ladies are in our cabin. This will add much to our social comforts, for without the smiles of woman nothing can prosper.
</p><p>
Today the passengers are all busily engaged in curing a lot of cabbage bought for their own convenience. Our fare is pretty hard, but as we are not quite regulated yet, more of this anon. I believe I am the only male passenger out of over forty who is free from the vice of using tobacco, either smoking or chewing. Some play cards or dominoes to while away the time. All, I believe, are supplied with books and many are commencing journals. All are disposed to minister to the comfort of others. So far we have progressed as a band of brothers and have had a delightful passage except that many of us have been seasick. DeWitt and I were miserable, indeed, but are recovering slowly. One of the sailors on board who had been sick and in a melancholy mood stabbed himself in the breast. He was taken on shore at New Castle, Delaware, and sent to Philadelphia. We fear he cannot recover.

On the evening of the Fourth of July, the Declaration of Independence was read by R. C. Stocton. Fiddling and dancing accompanied by drinking were kept up nearly all night. Next day some of the passengers, in consequence of the proceedings of the previous night, slept nearly all day.

We have not yet spoken a vessel and feel as if we were a little isolated community floating all alone on the broad bosom of the Atlantic, but we raised our
colors to let two vessels in the distance know we were American. One was home bound, the other from some foreign port.
</p><p>
Following our vessel are quite a number of birds resembling our common barnswallow, called Mother Carey's chicks, which, it is said, will follow us until we reach Cape Horn. While in the river we espied numerous sturgeons jumping out of the water, displaying their full length. Since we have come into the Atlantic we have seen many porpoises which appear about as large as full-grown hogsthe best comparison I can make, never having seen one except as they rise on the surface of the water.
