My Adored Ellen:--But a little while now remains ere I intend to wend my way to my old home. My home now, only because you are there. And I must here tell you that it is for you that I do intend to return and make my home there again. If you were not there many would be the days, months, aye, years, that would roll over ere I again visited the scenes of my younger days. Possibly I might never return. But if I only reach home safely, I know I will there find a richer treasure in you than I could gather here in a whole age, a treasure that will amply repay me for all I have endured. When I return and get settled it will be an easy matter for us to fix a proper and suitable time. I am glad you speak so confidently that your parents have no objections.
</p><p>
The nearer the time approaches for my return, the more impatient and restless I am getting. But time flies on lightning wings and a few weeks will soon roll around. Then, I am in hopes, we will not have to be separated a very long period at a time. The last two weeks have seemed almost as long as the last two years. I pray Heaven that when I start for home I may be favored with pleasant weather and fair winds.
</p><p>
By the last mail I forwarded to Mr. Evans a draft via Adams & Co. for an amount well above what he advanced me, and all that I can now raise will be my own.
</p><p>
This will be the last letter I expect to write you from this place and, indeed, my next I hope to carry to you myself. I hardly know what more to write, except to
tell you how happy I feel at the prospect of soon being with you, where I can press you to my bosom and tell you verbally what it would require pages of letters to contain. Ah, my dear Ellen, the many kind, loving and affectionate letters I have received from you have always been a balm to the vexations and trials incident to a residence in this far-off golden country; and now that I am about soon to return to that loved and confiding one, who wrote them, and with whom I have spent some of the happiest hours of my life, I almost feel too overjoyed to express myself. In two or three weeks after this reaches you, I expect to be in West Chester, and then you can tell the rest. Oh, how happy we will be.
</p><p>
I am making every preparation to leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> for Panama on the first of July in some one of the various steamships plying between those two places. I think I shall cross the Isthmus and go direct to New York. The Nicaragua route has a bad reputation here. I am afraid that none of my Chester County friends will return with me. I confidently hope to be with you in the beginning of August, and until then I need not assure you that I remain, as ever,
</p><p>
Your adoring
