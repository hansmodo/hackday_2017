My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I am much disappointed in being obliged to write 
you a short and hasty letter, and sorry to send you 
only the translation of one of your French pieces. 
Col. Barton, who brought me your letter of the 25th , 
made me happy by informing me that you were in a 
fair way of recovery; in that of the 23 d that you had 
recourse to your old experiment of cold water. Gen'l M'Intosh had told me that you were trying the effects 
of this uncommon application, and it made me uneasy; 
but I cannot help applauding it as it has succeeded. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a letter from Holland, and one from M ra 
Manning, to which the former served as cover. The 
blunder of our friend is unaccountable, but I am in 
hopes it will not be attended with the pernicious consequence which you seem to apprehend, as it will not 
be easy to ascertain or take hold of the property which 
you may have in private hands against the will of 
the party holding it. Capt Nichols is not yet returned 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; I have sent a message to him by 
the deputy Com y of prisoners who went in to-day, 
and I have no doubt that the Capt. will wait upon you 
if he conies out again.

Gen'l Smallwood who commands a division posted 
at Wilmington, has given us information that upon 
hearing of an armed brig being aground five miles 
above his post, he detached a strong party with two 
field pieces to take her. The Capt. of the brig upon 
the first summons refused to surrender, thinking the 
party was armed only with musquetry and prepared 
for defending himself; but being undeceived by 
two or three cannon shot, he struck. The prisoners 
taken on board of her are a British captain of foot, 
67 privates, the master of the brig, 12 seamen and 
about 40 women, some of whom are officers wives. 
The cargo is said to consist of clothing for soldiers, 
some arms and ammunition, some liquors, officers 
baggage and camp equipage; however, we do not 
know exactly. The captain of foot was too sulky 
to be communicative, and the master says the contents of the bales are unknown to him. The brig is 
armed with six four pounders and a few swivels. A 
sloop laden with pork, flour, &ca., for the <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
market is likewise taken and will be either burnt or 
secured as circumstances will permit. 
</p><p>
The enemy returned to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> last Sunday 
after having completed their forage, without any other 
inconvenience than a small balance of prisoners against 
them. It seems they had been necessitated to come 
out by having imprudently packed their former plunder 
of hay before it was thoroughly dry, by which means 
the greatest part was damaged and they were reduced 
to four days allowance in this article. 
</p><p>
The soldiers are nearly covered with good huts. The North Carolinians are the most backward in their 
buildings, and for want of sufficient energy to exert themselves once for all, will be exposed to lasting evils. 
</p><p>
The promotion of Gen'l Conway has given almost universal disgust. His military knowledge and experience may fit him for the office of inspector genera], 
but the right of seniority violated, without any remark able services done to justify it, has given a deep wound to the line of brigadiers. 
</p><p>
It is said that the influence of a certain general officer at Reading is productive of great mischief. 
When Gen'l Conway went from camp he gave out that 
he meant to return to France, his countrymen under 
stood the manoeuvre ; it has succeeded to his wish, 
and I believe now he is exceedingly indiffirent whether 
he acts Insp r Gen'l or no. I am rather inclined to think 
that he prefers returning with his splendid titles to 
France, where he hopes to obtain a lucrative and 
peaceful office in the service of the states. 
</p><p>
I devoutly pray that many new years of happiness 
may be added to your life. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>

The Chevalier du Plessis who commanded the 
artillery and acted as engineer at Fort Mercer has 
obtained a promise from his Excellency, to write in 
his behalf to Congress in order that his merit may be 
rewarded by promotion as from the improvements 
which he made at Fort Mercer and his gallant conduct 
when Count Donop was repulsed, he deserves well of 
the United States ; if the general should recommend 
him in consequence of his promise, which I suppose 
he will do whenever his time permits, I would solicit 
that the reasons for the Chevalier's promotion may be 
express'd in the resolve of Congress, which will be of 
great service to him in France.
