Sir, 
</p><p>
You will immediately on the receipt of this be pleased to collect as many men of your command as you 
possibly can, and march them from the place of rendezvous, so as to form a junction, without fail, with Colonel Sheldon at Clapp's m Eng Street on the 2d 
of July by sunset. You must not exceed that time on any account. You will bring four days' provision ready cooked. You will receive further orders at 
Clapp's. Carry no baggage; the movement is to be as light as possible. I must enjoin it, and I shall depend upon your keeping your movement a profound 
secret from every officer under your command. You will be pleased to inform me, by return of Captain BuIlvk'V, of the number of men which you think you 
shall probably collect. I am, Sir, etc.
