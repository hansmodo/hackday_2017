My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your very welcome letter of the 9th inst. I received 
at the moment I was contemplating sending to you our 
third volume of Agricultural Memoirs, as a small token of 
remembrance. I shall, by the first opportunity, have it forwarded to you. A few of us endeavour to keep this subject alive amid the din of. arms, which are ever hostile to 
the arts of peace and their attendant blessings. Too much 
of this effort falls on me ; but yet some relief from surrounding glooms is found in attention to topics which abstract 
the mind from the vices and follies plentifully scattered 
throughout our devoted country. Mortification under what 
we arc, is at least for the moment suspended, while we contemplate on what we have been. It may return with double 
force, when we consider what we might have been. 
</p><p>
But it seems that history affords ample proofs, and ours 
as much as any other, that " this world was made for 
ir." The enjoyment of liberty is fugacious ; but despotism, under a variety of shapes, is permanent. There is 
a tendency to it in all human political institutions ; and the 
people of every country have, from time immemorial, forged 
their own chains. Our " free and enlightened" citizens are 
now very busy at the anvil ; but whether their work will 
now be completed, is not for us to decide. Heaven may 
send us chastisement without ruin, and possibly the former 
may save us for a time. Delusion is the order of the day. 
Gordon, in one of his discourses on Tacitus, endeavours to 
prove that the people, when deceived by dehulers, are blind 
and cruel, yet mean well. Too many of our people are 
blind, yet few cruel ; as to their meaning well, they take a 
lamentable mode of showing it. 
</p><p>
Your letter contains an epitome of my thoughts on our 
political situation. Had I written a book (and I have no 
adversary who would think it worth his while to wish that 
I had), I could not express myself more clearly on the subject. At our age we are lookers-on, and see the game 
better than those who play it. The insight which calm 
observation and experience afford is, however, of no use to 
those who deem themselves too wise to need instruction. 
We must wait events, like passengers in a bark buffeted 
by storms, and mismanaged by unskilful pilots and mariners. 
I hope our vessel is yet stanch, and that she will get into 
port, whatever untoward appearances may predict. It is 
indeed distressing when hope alone is our comforter. But, 
alas ! all I know is far from furnishing light or brilliancy to 
the threatening and dusky cloud which overhangs our 
hemisphere. 
</p><p>
Our president is not the man we once supposed him. Party antipathies may possibly paint in too sombre colours; 
but the stories I hear are distressing, particularly to me, who in early times had a sincere personal friendship for him. 
He would then take some strange flights : one of them was his joining in the philippic against you, for not consulting 
the French minister (Vergennes), when the interest of your country forbade the step. But, in general, I thought and 
acted with him. In this matter, far otherwise ; nor have I, in his modern conduct, been in union with his political 
sentiments on any important subject, although I entertain no personal enmity. 
</p><p>
I have a strong impression that we shall, ere long, have 
peace ; but the why and the wherefore I cannot tell, save 
that there seems nothing really substantial enough in the 
litigated affairs of the two nations, to continue the business 
of throat-cutting ; and I fancy our enemy is tired of the 
employment, after following the trade so long. 
</p><p>
I am gratified with the account of your travelling on 
towards the goal we all must arrive at, with a mind tranquil, and a body without pain. Your companions — books 
and recollections — are consolatory and essential, when all 
others have lost their relish. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind inquiries about my health. I 
have but lately recovered from a most unfortunate accident, having been thrown on the stones of our turnpike 
from my horse, who took fright and ran away with me. 
He was a Kentucky racer (a quality I did not know), and 
no doubt took his revenge for his countrymen, by chastising me for my bad politics. I had three trenched gashes 
in my pericranium ; yet I escaped becoming crack-brained, 
which may be reckoned uncivil, as it is fashionable nowadays, at least, among politicians ; and it is the ton to be in 
the fashion. Believe me always 
</p><p>
Most affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
