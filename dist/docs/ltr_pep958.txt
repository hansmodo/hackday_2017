Dear Christman:--It is little more than three weeks today since you left us. Time generally passes rapidly, though these three weeks appear a long time to me. I have missed you very much in the office; I feel the need of some confidential friend to chat with. We are getting along pretty well, though I must be the first at the breach and the last at the route in the various duties in the office, on account of the boys being all young and inexperienced. The editor also gets the devil in him frequently.
</p><p>
In West Chester everything continues pretty much as it was. The Guards had a fine time of it on the Fourth, mustering 35 men. The company is getting along swimmingly. The ladies are all first-rate, but no beaux. The beaux are all going to California. There is considerable talk now about a number more going from West Chester. I feel like going myself. Be not surprised if you should meet me there.
</p><p>
About myself, as regards the ladies, I have something to say which may surprise you as well as it has been unexpected to many in this place. The cord which bound Miss Bradshaw and me together has been
broken. We are no longer lovers. Many causes tended to produce this effect, but the most important one was jealousy. On the Saturday evening when I returned from the city I called to see her ladyship and proposed calling on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a>, as I wished to see her. We did so and a walk was taken together. Everything passed off properly, I supposed. Not much was said. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a> was rather low spirited and I was not in very high spirits. On Sunday evening following I called to go to church. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a> was there also; I invited her to go along. She went home and Cad and I called for her. I perceived that there was something wrong with Miss Bradshaw. After we had returned from church I asked Cad what was the matter. At first she would not tell, but she finally said that I had been paying more attention to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a> than I had to her. This rather raised my blood, though I mildly told her that such was not the fact, much less was it my intention, that she ought to know better, and I thought she had a very bad opinion of me to accuse me of anything of this kind. I left without coming to any particular conclusion what I should do. But the more I thought about it the more I felt like stopping. A few days afterwards, I sent her a note stating that I had broken off. Since that time all the presents I had made her have been returned, and the matter has been fairly consummated. This affair is the subject of much talk about town at this time. It will soon die away, however.
</p><p>
And now, allow me to say that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a> has in no way given any cause to produce this result. It was the promptings of a generous feeling on my part to do for her every favor, especially as she continued so melancholy in regard to your absence. Unfortunately
</p><p>
Miss Bradshaw, although possessing many generous and noble qualities, allowed jealousy to wither her better feelings and prevent herself, Miss Apple and me from mutually enjoying many pleasures. I believe she and Miss Apple still remain friends, though perhaps not as ardent as heretofore. I frequently call on Miss Apple and shall repeat the calls oftener when this matter of Caroline Bradshaw has fully died away. Since I have left her I have visited and taken to church several times Miss Hodgson, who is a young lady very much esteemed among us printers. Taking into consideration her age, she is one of the finest young ladies I have ever been acquainted with, and bids fair of being an object of no little attention.
</p><p>
All hands send their warmest regards.
</p><p>
I remain,
</p><p>
