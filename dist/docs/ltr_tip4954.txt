SIR, 
</p><p>
The account you gave me this morning of the false tales 
spread abroad in New Hampshire, especially in the remoter 
towns, where correct information is not easy to be had, 
induces me to present to you my correspondence with Governor Sullivan, in which I have stated the circumstances 
respecting my conduct on the day of the battle of <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, not a syllable of which, to my knowledge, has ever 
been contradicted ; and which, indeed, numbers yet living of 
my townsmen of Salem know to be true, some of whom are 
Democrats, and would eagerly have seized on any misstatement, if I had made any. 
</p><p>
In page 26 of my letter to Governor Sullivan, I mention the winter campaign of <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a> -77 with the Massachusetts 
militia. The quota of Salem consisted wholly of volunteers. 
Upon notice, the militia assembled in the meeting-house in 
Salem (now Dr. Prince s). I went into the pulpit and 
addressed them, stating the critical situation of our public 
affairs, the necessity of reenforcing the army, the enlistments of the troops then expiring, and that it was at 
such a time of difficulty and danger that the real patriot 
would show his zeal and devotion to his country. I 
then concluded my speech (which was extempore) in this 
manner : 
</p><p>
In urging you, fellow-citizens and soldiers, to volunteer your services on this occasion, I have no thought of 
excusing myself; I will go with you, and partake of all the 
hardships, as well as the dangers, of a winter campaign. 
I then left the pulpit, and marched round the aisles of the 
meeting-house,* and in a few minutes was followed by up 
wards of sixty f of my townsmen (many of them masters of 
vessels) , rather more than the town's quota. The county 
of Essex furnished a regiment of a little more than seven 
hundred men, who marched under my command as Colonel, 
and performed the campaign in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and New Jersey. 
The following questions are obvious to be asked : 
</p><p>
I. If I had shown any signs of cowardice on the day of 
the battle of <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, would my townsmen, who were 
with me that day, and others who knew all that passed, 
have turned out as volunteers, the next year, to make a campaign under my command ? 
II. If my conduct was blamable on the day of the battle 
of <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, as now, for party purposes, is pretended, 
would the revolutionary government of Massachusetts have intrusted me with various important offices ? 
</p><p>
Now, that government, in the same year, <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a> , after the 
battle of <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, appointed me a Justice of the Peace 
and a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for the County 
of Essex ; and, what was still more important, they appointed 
me sole Judge of the admiralty or maritime court for the 
Middle District of Massachusetts, comprehending <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
Marblehead, Salem, Beverly, Gloucester, and <a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a> ; 
into which were brought many more prizes taken from the 
British than into the whole State beside. I held these 
offices until I went to the army under <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>'s 
immediate command, in June, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a> . In the period of less 
than two years that I was Judge of the maritime court, about 
a hundred and fifty prizes were brought in, tried, and condemned. 
</p><p>
In my letter to Governor Sullivan, (page 29,) you will 
see that I was appointed by Congress a member of the Continental Board of War, in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>General Gates</a> 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker met'>General Mifflin</a>. This was near the close of the campaign of <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a> . Now take notice, that the late Governor 
Samuel Adams, John Adams, late President of the United 
States, and Elbridge Gerry, now Governor of Massachusetts, 
were the members of Congress present from Massachusetts 
at the time I was chosen one of the members of the Board 
of War. 
</p><p>
Will any man of common sense and common honesty, in any political party called Democratic, require more or better proofs that my conduct on the day of the battle of 
<a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a> was not liable to censure ? And what stronger proofs could be offered them in support of my integrity, fidelity, and patriotism? 
Whoever knows, or shall know, these facts, and yet continues to revile me, must be a base and wicked slanderer. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, your old neighbor and friend, 
</p><p>
TIMOTHY PICKERING.
