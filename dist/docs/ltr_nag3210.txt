I am sorry it has not been in my power to give 
your Excellency an earlier answer to your letter of 
the 26th ultimo. The subject is a matter of such 
moment, that, although it required despatch, yet the 
delay must be less injurious than a want of fall 
information to decide with certainty. 
</p><p>
It is not less mortifying to me, than unhappy for 
the public interest and national security, that circumstances oblige me to confess myself unable, for want 
of sufficient support, either to make the proper provision in my department, necessary for marching the 
troops to the southward, or for putting the army in 
motion in these Northern States. There would be no 
difficulty, either in the one case or the other, could 
the treasury furnish the proper supplies of cash. But 
in its present exhausted state, with the enormous demands upon the department, the agents have neither 
credit nor influence equal to the business. 
</p><p>
Orders were seasonably issued for an ample provision for the opening campaign. Many are in part 
executed, and might be easily completed, were the 
agents enabled to fulfil their contracts. But the 
manufacturers, for want of payment, will neither go 
on with the business, nor deliver what they have completed. And though the loss of these articles will 
be a capital injury to the public, as well in point of 
saving in expense as that of accommodating the 
army, yet there is not the remotest prospect of obtaining cash, seasonably, to prevent the misfortune. 
</p><p>
I have given general and particular orders to the 
agents, to collect from the manufacturers as many of 
the articles contracted for as possible, and to hold 
them in readiness for further orders. But the people 
have suffered so much by the depreciation of the money, that they will not part with their property 
without immediate payment. In this predicament are 
the stores manufacturing for public use ; what part 
we shall be able to obtain, is difficult to determine. 
</p><p>
The public horses, which are quartered about in 
different parts of the country, are suffering for want 
of forage ; and I am afraid many will perish, before 
the States, under the new requisition, will provide amply for their support. But, could the whole be 
made fit for service at the opening of the campaign, 
which will by no means be the case, the number 
would be very insufficient to answer the demands of 
the army. I am, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
