DEAR SIR, I have been favored with yours of April 
</p><p>
The newspapers will have given you some idea of our proceedings, though in a state always mutilated, and often perverted. 
The impost is still the subject of deliberation. The general 
quantum of duties has at some periods been a source of discussion; at others, the ratio of particular duties have produced still 
more of it. The proper one between Rum and Molasses has 
been the last and the longest question of that sort. I fear it will 
not be possible to establish a due and politic proportion without admitting excises, so far as to reach the distilleries. The 
dilemma between that expedient and a palpable inequality in 
the burden, and injury to the Treasury, is a perplexing one.
