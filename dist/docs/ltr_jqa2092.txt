The state of this country is in general tolerably quiet and 
peaceable, excepting every now and then a little irregular 
usurpation of sovereignty by clubs and popular assemblages ; 
hitherto they have not been followed by any tragical event. 
The dissolution of the confederation, and the consolidation 
of all the provinces into a sing e republic, by the convocation of a National Assembly, has been for many months an 
object of great solicitude, more especially because a difference of opinion has arisen in the different provinces, upon the 
propriety of the proposed alteration. The province of Holland almost unanimously, and the popular societies and 
clubs in all the others, have pursued very tenaciously the 
point upon which they think the permanency of their revolution will turn ; but the majority of the people in most of 
the smaller provinces, are strenuously averse to the change, 
and adhere tenaciously to their federal system. The parties 
have at length proceeded so far, that the provincial assembly 
of Holland has taken a formal resolution, that in case the 
other provinces do not unanimously agree to call the National Assembly by the 25th of this month, this province 
will take the step alone, or together with those that will 
agree to join it, without waiting any longer for the assent 
of the remaining members.

I have been amused but not surprized, to observe with 
what zeal the most ardent patriots here connect in argument, provincial sovereignty and aristocracy, after having seen so many patriots no less ardent in America, labouring with 
the same industry, to make the essence of Republicanism 
consist in State Sovereignty. I knew before this that the 
arguments of a party are generally urged more for their operation than for their weight. . . .
