MY LORD Wonder not, that the people, in this remote part of his majesty's dominions, revere your lordship's character; and since there is no part of the British Empire, 
which does not feel the influence of Lord Camden's virtues, America in particular, must ever regard your lordship, as the patron of its liberty, best 
possession of human nature. 
</p><p>
Prompted by gratitude, they entreat your lordship to accept their humble thanks, and to favour them with permitting your likeness to be taken, that it may remain a 
memorial to posterity, of their veneration, and of the inestimable benefit derived to British America, from your lordship's protection. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, my lord, your lordship's most obedient and devoted servant,

To the rt. hon. CHARLES LORD CAMDEN, 
</p><p>
Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.
