My dear General, 
</p><p>
Had I not so perfect a confidence in your friendship, I should very much fear to tire you with my 
scribbling of this day ; but cannot leave my pen before I have again mentioned my tender, respectful 
affection to my dear General. I want to tell jou 
that Madame de Lafayette and my three children are 
well, and that all of us, in the family, heartily join 
to present their dutiful, affectionate compliments to 
Mrs. Washington and yourself. Tell her that I hope 
soon to thank her for a dish of tea at I<a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. Yes, my dear General, before the month of 
June is over, you will see a vessel coming up the 
Potomac, and out of that vessel will your friend 
jump, with a panting heart, and all the feelings of 
perfect happiness.

I intended to have gone sooner ; but a few commercial matters will keep me here; for, since nobody 
meddles with them, I have undertaken, in my private 
capacity, to do what is possible for one who has 
neither title nor instruction. It is at least a comfort 
that, in my private capacity, I cannot commit Congress ; and that I never speak but of what I know. 
Four ports having been declared free, I send <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> a letter respecting the duties to be paid there; 
and I hope Congress will also publish that all duties 
have been removed for the exportation of brandies.

Most of the Americans here are virulent against our 
Association Wadsworth must be excepted, and Dr. 
Franklin said little; but Jay, Adams, and all the others, 
warmly blame the army. You easily guess I am not 
remiss in opposing them. However, if it is found 
that the heredity endangers the true principles of democracy, I am as ready as any man to renounce it. 
You will be my compass, my dear General; because, 
at this distance, I cannot judge. In case, after better 
consideration, you find that heredity will injure our 
democratic constitutions, I join with you, by proxy, 
in voting against it. But I do so much rely on your 
judgment that, if you think heredity is a proper 
scheme, I shall be convinced that your patriotism has 
considered the matter in the best point of view. To 
you alone I would say so much ; and I abide by 
your opinion in the matter. Let the foregoing be 
confidential ; but, I am sure, your disinterested virtue 
will weigh all possible future consequences of hereditary distinctions. 
</p><p>
There are no news at this moment that are worth relating. What respects balloons, M. L'Enfant will tell. The present English disputes are somewhat 
ridiculous ; they must end in a dissolution of Parliament, or a union between Pitt and Fox. Adieu, my dear General. Accept, with your usual goodness, the 
affectionate tribute of a heart so entirely devoted to you, that no words can ever express the respect, the love, and all the sentiments, with which you know it 
</p><p>
Alluding to the recent experiments of Montgolfier in the construction of balloons. is glowing for you, and that make me, until my last breath, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble, and affectionate friend,
