TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY 
</p><p>
[OLIVER WOLCOTT] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, April 10th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR: 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> in November last, the situation of the funds of the United States in Europe and 
the established mode whereby provision was made for satisfaction of the calls for payments of interest so frequently 
returning at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> and at Antwerp were altogether unknown to me. As the subject had not been mentioned 
in my instructions I presumed that it was not considered as 
requiring particular attention from me, and as the circumstances have rendered some intervention on my part necessary, I take the liberty of 
inclosing herewith my correspondence relative to the payment of the interest due in December upon the Antwerp loan. 
</p><p>
During my first visit to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> one of the holders of the Antwerp obligations, who was at that time a refugee 
from Brabant, came to me and inquired whether the interest usually paid by Mr. De Wolf in December could not 
be paid at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> or elsewhere. I mentioned the circumstances to Mr. Hubbard, and then learnt from him 
that the interest payable by Mr. De Wolf had hitherto been annually remitted by the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> bankers, but 
that it had not been sent as usual for the payment then approaching. 
</p><p>
Within a few days after the 1st of December I had several applications from the creditors of the Antwerp loan similar 
to that I have already mentioned. I thought it necessary to pay attention to a circumstance which might interest 
in some measure the credit of the United States, and wrote on the yth of the month to the bankers at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, as 
may be seen together with their answer in the papers in closed, marked No. i. 
</p><p>
As they had not received their usual orders to remit the 
money, and I had no authority to give them, the matter 
rested in this situation until the 31st of the same December. 
They wrote me that they had then received their orders to 
make the remittance, and had informed Mr. De Wolf they 
would supply him so soon as the remittance should be allowed 
by the government of this country. The engagement to 
make the remittance was considered by me as sufficiently 
positive, but it was made contingent. The obstacle arising 
from the prohibitions of the government here had not been 
mentioned before, and I presumed it was not insuperable ; 
but it strongly confirmed me in the opinion I had already 
formed, that my particular attention to this business would 
be proper and necessary, though I had no particular instructions relative to it. 
</p><p>
I knew the remittance was still impracticable, not for the 
reason mentioned in their letter, but from another fact of which I had recently been informed and which is noticed 
in my answer to the Bankers dated January I3th. This letter and answer together with their reply are comprised 
within the mark No. of the inclosed copies. 
</p><p>
On the 19th of January the French troops arrived at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, and from that time the communication with 
Antwerp was restored and the prohibition against the transmission of money ceased. On the same day I had with 
Messrs. William Willink and Hubbard a conversation in which the former gentlemen made the observations which 
I related in the last letter I had the honor of writing you, dated February 2d. These observations were variant from 
the letter of December 31st, new reasons were alleged for not pursuing orders received, and I was convinced beyond all 
question that my particular attention to the affair had be come an essential part of my duty. But all the same I had 
so little hope of obtaining the transmission of the money that in my letter of February 2, will be found my decided 
opinion, that in case Mr. De Wolf should soon be liberated the payment of interest due on his loan would depend upon his power to advance the money. 
</p><p>
Though the observations of Mr. Willink so soon after the letter of December st were somewhat unexpected, I thought 
it unnecessary to enter upon a discussion on the subject, and observed only that Mr. De \Volf being in captivity it 
was still impossible to send him the money, and while I expressed my full approbation of several other arrangements 
which they had taken at that critical period, and which they communicated to me, at the same time I kept an entire silence as to this particular determination. 
</p><p>
On the nth of March I was informed that Mr. De Wolf 
was again at liberty, had returned to Antwerp, and was 
expecting the remittance from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> to pay his interests due in December. I wrote the next day to the bankers, 
and a correspondence ensued, marked No. in the within copies, which terminated in a positive refusal by them to 
send the money to Mr. De Wolf. This was indeed what I had expected, and what I presumed it would be impossible 
for me to counteract, destitute as I was of orders and even of authority. 
</p><p>
Hitherto there had been no communication whatever 
between Mr. De Wolf and me upon this business, but at the 
same time when the letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> of 17 March 
was delivered to me I also received one from him of the 16, 
the copy of which herewith sent is marked No. 4. 
</p><p>
I did not feel myself authorized to accept the proposal 
to borrow money at an interest for this payment, but the 
offer gave me an argument which I was persuaded would be 
more convincing to the minds of our bankers in engaging 
them to make the remittance than anything I had before 
been able to use. A second correspondence took place, the 
copies of which are under the mark No. 5, the result of 
which was that they authorized Mr. De Wolf to draw upon 
them for the money. 
</p><p>
The remaining copies within, marked No. 6, are of letters 
which afterwards passed between Mr. De Wolf and me. 
They only serve to show the termination of the business. 
From the perusal of the whole correspondence an accurate 
judgment may be formed of the dispositions, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> 
relative to the Antwerp loan, and from the whole course of 
circumstances which have occurred in this transaction I am 
obliged to repeat an observation made in my last letter, 
that nothing beyond the line of the most rigorous duty will 
ever by done by those gentlemen to facilitate the payment 
of that interest. I may add that so far as the punctual 
fulfillment of that obligation is an object worthy of attention to the United States, and so long as it is made dependent 
upon any agency of theirs, it becomes indispensable to give them no plausible reason to hesitate a moment in making 
the remittances according to their order. 
</p><p>
Since the affair was finished I have received the letters 
which you did me the honor of writing me on the 1st and 5th 
of December last with the duplicate and triplicate at the 
same time. They came with a letter from Mr. Pinckney 
urgently demanding a remittance of 303,115 [florins] accord 
ing to the bill of which your letters advised me. I wrote 
to the gentlemen at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> on the subject. They have 
answered Mr. Pinckney, and sent him a draft for 3000 
sterling, as being the only unengaged balance belonging 
to the United States in their hands. 
</p><p>
They suppose that the principal object of the bill was to 
place the funds out of the reach of danger, and as the danger 
which might be contemplated at the time when the bill was 
drawn is now past, they think it unnecessary to send the 
whole amount of the bill. I presume from your favor of 
December 5th and from Mr. Pinckney's letter to me, that 
the money was intended for some particular employment, 
but when they say they have not the money to send, the 
only part left for me is acquiescence. 
</p><p>
There will considerable payments become due on the first of June. I presume the gentlemen at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> will be prepared for them. 
</p><p>
The two millions which were proposed to be borrowed to 
be at the disposition of the Minister at Lisbon seem to be 
altogether out of the question. The previous advice from 
him has not been received, and could probably not be followed by a successful loan if it were. Business of all kinds 
is very much at a stand. There is at the present moment 
no sort of confidence in anything, but perhaps that of public loans is more essentially impaired than any other. Be 
sides the calls for money for internal exigencies are so numerous and so imperious, that there is no prospect of a 
return of the superfluity from whence the public loans were heretofore supplied. 
</p><p>
I have taken occasion from my correspondence with Mr. 
De Wolf to inquire of him, whether there is any probability 
that a loan of two or three millions may become practicable 
at Antwerp very soon. His answer makes the circumstance 
dependent upon a variety of contingencies, some more and 
some less probable than others. He has however requested 
to correspond occasionally with me upon the subject of 
American credit, and I presume will give me the earliest 
intimation of any occurrence that may take place favorable 
to the success of any loan that might be proposed. 
</p><p>
The zeal of our bankers at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> for the honor and 
interest of the United States needs no stimulus, but it will 
never be more active than while credit may be obtained and 
is deserved at Antwerp. 
</p><p>
I have the honor, &c. 
</p><p>
