<p><i>[Biographers Note:All this time my father was very hard at work organising and equipping
the volunteers who were pouring into Richmond from the Southern States,
but he was in constant correspondence with my mother, helping her all
he could in her arrangements for leaving her home.  His letters show
that he thought of everything, even the least, and he gave the most
particular directions about his family, their effects, the servants,
the horses, the farm, pictures, plate, and furniture.  Being called
to Norfolk suddenly, before going he wrote to my mother:]</i>

My Dear Mary:  I am called down to Norfolk and leave this afternoon.
I expect to return Friday, but may be delayed.  I write to advise
you of my absence, in case you should not receive answers to any
letters that may arrive.  I have not heard from you since I last
wrote; nor have I anything to relate.  I heard from my dear little
Rob, who had an attack of chills and fever.  He hoped to escape the
next paroxysm....  I witnessed the opening of the convention [The
Episcopal Convention of the Diocese of Virginia] yesterday, and
heard the good Bishop's [Bishop Meade, of Virginia] sermon, being
the 50th anniversary of his ministry.  It was a most impressive scene,
and more than once I felt the tears coming down my cheek.  It was
from the text, 'and Pharoh said unto Jacob, how old art thou?'  It
was full of humility and self-reproach.  I saw Mr. Walker, Bishop
Johns, Bishop Atkinson, etc.  I have not been able to attend any
other services, and presume the session will not be prolonged.  I
suppose it may be considered a small attendance.  Should Custis
arrive during my absence, I will leave word for him to take my room
at the Spotswood till my return.  Smith [His brother, S. S. Lee,
C. S. N.] is well and enjoys a ride in the afternoon with Mrs.
Stannard.  The charming women, you know, always find him out.  Give
much love to Cousin Anna, Nannie, and dear daughters.  When Rob leaves
the University take him with you.
</p>
Truly and affectionately,                      <a href=http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel rel=me>R. E. Lee.</a>
