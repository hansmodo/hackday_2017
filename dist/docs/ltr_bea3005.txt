DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
By the best intelligence we have been able to procure of the enemy's force on Rhode Island, it consisted of about six thousand men; eleven regiments 
of British, and four of Hessians. Two thousand embarked the 21st instant, in twenty-four transports, and 
sailed from Newport three days since, supposed for 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as they were seen off New London, Part of the remainder, believed about fifteen hundred, are 
disposed over the Island in seeming great security. 
They have a small fort opposite Bristol Ferry, and 
are raising a work opposite Fogland Ferry. One of 
their frigates was lately drove from thence, and was 
yesterday replaced by a fifty-gun ship and two tenders, which we are preparing to attack, by guns on 
shore, and our galleys, which are ordered down. 
</p><p>
At a Council of General Officers, held a few days 
since, it was advised to land a body of eight thou 
sand men (if they can be procured) on Rhode Island, 
and attack the enemy in the following manner, namely; Five thousand men, with proper artillery, to embark at Rowland's Ferry and land nearly opposite 
Fogland Ferry, and to take post on a high ground, 
under cover of a thick wood, on the middle of the 
Island, six miles this side of Newport. Three thou 
sand men to embark at Bristol and Rowland's Ferry, 
and attack the enemy in the different posts, a diversion to be made by a party from Seconnet, who are 
to land three miles from Newport. At the same 
time, two fire-ships are to be sent into Newport 
among the transports; two frigates and two galleys 
are to be placed between Bristol and Rowland's Ferry, which, with the batteries, will effectually secure 
our retreat. We are making every necessary preparation of boats, artillery, &c., which will be complete 
in two or three weeks. Nothing will be wanting but 
men. We have, at present, only four thousand. Not 
more than one thousand more (of the six ordered) 
can be expected. With this number, as they are 
chiefly raw militia, I believe your Excellency will not 
think it prudent for us to make a general attack. 
The deficiency I know of no way of making up but 
by calling in four or five Continental regiments from 
the States of Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire. 
If this number can be procured, we have a good prospect of dislodging the enemy from Newport; if not, 
we must be content to harass them with small parties. I suppose Major-General Spencer has wrote 
your Excellency very particularly on the subject, and 
will wait for your directions in the matter. 
</p><p>
This will be delivered to your Excellency by Captain Mansfield, whom, I recommended, in my last as 
a proper person to command a company of artillery. If your Excellency should think proper to appoint 
him, I beg the favor that he may be allowed to return here immediately. I am, with sentiments of great respect and esteem, Dear General, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and most obedient, 
</p><p>
Humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have inclosed a plan of Rhode Island and 
the adjacent country, by which you will observe the 
great difficulty of coining at the enemy, and the necessity of having a superior force, if we land on the 
Island. B. A.
