Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Fully impressed with the idea of the utility of early, regular, and accurate communication of the kind in contemplation, I shall make no difficulty in acceding to the 
proposal contained in your private letter from Newport. But at the same time that I am engaging in behalf of the United States a liberal reward for the services of the 
C s, of whose fidelity and ability I entertain a high opinion, it is certainly but reasonable, from patriotism 
and every other principle, that their exertions should be proportionably great, to subserve essentially the interest 
of the public. All the interior and minute arrangements of the correspondence I request that you will settle 
with them as expeditiously and advantageously as may be, and especially that you will urge, in very forcible 
terms, the necessity of having the communication as circumstantial, frequent, and expeditious as possible. 
</p><p>
The great objects of information you are very well acquainted with ; such as arrivals, embarkations, preparations for movements, alterations of positions, situations 
of posts, fortifications, garrisons, strength or weakness of each, distribution and strength of corps, and, in general, every thing which can be interesting and important for us to know. 
</p><p>
Besides these, you are also sensible there are many things upon a smaller scale, which are necessary to be reported, and that whatever intelligence is communicated ought to be, not in general terms, but in detail, 
and with the greatest precision. At present I am anxious to know (lor the reports have been very nunicroiis, 
vague, and uncertain), whether another cniharkalion is 
preparing, ani-l, it" so, to what amount, and where destined ; what the present force of the enemy is, particularly on Long Island, in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and at Kingsbridge ; what corps are at the latter place, how strong, 
and where posted exactly ; and, indeed, what the situation, prospects, and designs of the enemy are, so far 
as they can be penetrated. I am, &,c.
