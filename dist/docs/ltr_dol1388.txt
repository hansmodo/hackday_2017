<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> has received your letter, my dear cousin, and desires me to answer "as I please" the subject of his picture; 
when I will take advantage of the occasion to express my great sorrow at the 
cause of your detention, and my hope that you will exert great fortitude, knowing that 
a cheerful spirit will aid your recovery. By the Ida I received a letter from dear 
Payne. He is charmed with his voyage so far, and had escaped sea-sickness, though 
all the party had succumbed. You will pity me, I know, when you hear that 
Mitchell has left us for France, that I am acting in his department, and that the city 
is so full of strangers I am positively dizzy. There is so much to say to you 
and so little time. About the picture, if Mr. D. will return it safe in six months, 
more or less, he may send for it as soon as ever he chooses. Present me to Dr. Physic, and pray tell <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pbm" rel="friend met">P. Morris</a> that I love her as much as ever.

Yours in friendship,
