ON BOARD SCHOONER COLUMBIA March 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1851">1851</a> Latt 7° 35' South Lon 145° West
</p><p>
I thought I would take this opportunity of giving you some of the particulars of my voyage as I have plenty of leisure time on my hands just now, and when I arrive (if I ever do) in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> I shall probably be busy.
</p><p>
We sailed from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> on the 23rd of December. In three days we were off Santa Barbara. We pulled in with the boat for the Captain's brother, who had been left there sick some months before. We ascertained that he had left for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> three days previous. This
is an old Spanish town of some forty or fifty houses and has not changed like the rest of the country. It is a very quiet, pretty little place. We stopped about four hours and then pulled about the bay six hours trying to find the schooner in the dark. We finally found her and stood out to sea.
</p><p>
In seventeen days from the coast we made Hood's Island and the same afternoon anchored in one of the bays in the island of Wooahooya, one of the Marquesas group. The first view of these islands disappointed me. They looked barren. The interior rises in lofty mountains with spurs running to the shore, terminating in bold headlands. These form the valleys, where the inhabitants reside, and the bays. The mountains are covered with grass and the valleys are filled with cocoanut, banana and breadfruit trees with brooks running by them. The natives reside altogether in these valleys.
</p><p>
Hardly was our anchor down before the natives began to gather on the shore and put off, the men in canoes and the women (who are not allowed to get into a canoe, all over the group on account of the taboo) swimming. I may as well mention here that we had on board a fellow by the name of Daniel Marsh who had resided in this bay and in the island of Nukehua eight years. He had his wife and a girl from Nukehua and we had as passengers two other native girls belonging to Nukehua, who came to California in the ship Nile. They had had enough of California and were glad to get back to eat Poe Poe and swim in the surf once more. They dressed like the whites and were pretty well civilized. Dan spoke the language like a native and was to trade for us.
</p><p>
We allowed the natives to come on board as Dan knew most of them. We soon had the deck covered with them. They behaved themselves very well. I was struck by their fine forms and particularly at finding them so white.
</p><p>
Some of the girls were as white as you are. The men are tattooed all over, like a wall painted in fresco. Some of them were almost lead color and entirely naked except for a 'humi' or piece of Tappa around the loins. The females wore a piece of Tappa coming down to the knees and had wreaths around their heads. They are not tattooed.
</p><p>
It was an amusing sight to see them--swimming around the vessel, crawling up on the bobstays and hanging on to the davy falls astern, laughing, chattering and spattering each other, and joking with those on board. They do their piece of Tappa up in a small bundle and hold it up out of water with one hand, to keep it dry. But they always put it on before they come over the side of the vessel. They have a feeling of modesty even though their dress is scanty.
</p><p>
As Captain Phillips and I sat aft, eating our bananas and enjoying the novelty of the scene, he remarked that he should like to haul into Deacon Darling's wharf with all of them on board!
</p><p>
Toward night the wind began to blow fresh and we thought it safer to haul her in under the land. The anchor was hove short and a line run. The kanakas took hold and when the anchor was lifted the line parted and before the anchor brought her up we were close in to the breakers. The wind blew a perfect gale and with both anchors she kept dragging toward the shore. We now ran the large hawser to the opposite shore. It took an hour to do this and all the time we were thumping on the rocks. There were only six feet of water astern.
</p><p>
As we were all busy the kanakas amused themselves by stealing all the light articles lying around loose. They stole my blankets and all the traps out of the long boat belonging to the hatch-bar crew. They are most expert thieves and will steal a thing before your face and jump
overboard before you can lay your hand on them. I will give them the credit, however, of helping haul the vessel off. Finally the hawser was made fast and by heaving on the anchor and all the kanakas hauling on the wharf, we got into deep water again and I felt as though a mountain had been taken off of me. I breathed easily again for this grinding on the coral rocks with fifty of these natives on board, grunting with satisfaction every time she struck, is not very pleasant.
</p><p>
We got very little trade here and sailed for Dominique, an island about sixty miles to windward. The chiefs are very fond of visiting around the group so we carried over five of the natives. One of them was the King of the bay, old 'Tukerwahoo.' He was a comical genius and made a great deal of sport for us. We clothed him up and the Captain gave him a beaver hat with a red band. This he only wore on going ashore. He was the best swimmer I have ever seen. In filling the water we upset the boat. In the surf the Captain's pistols and two muskets were lost overboard. The old fellow went down in the breakers and the first dive he brought both pistols. The next time, one musket--though the other he could not find. But they eat up all the provisions on board. You never would call me a large eater if you could have two or three of these chiefs to dinner--and liquors don't come amiss.
</p><p>
At one bay in Dominique we got 100 hogs, 100 squashes, 200 cocoanuts and 10 bbls of sweet potatoes, at the rate of five hogs for one keg of powder, three for one musket, one for a hatchet, etc.
</p><p>
Here we found the owner of the Schooner 'Sam Fox,' Mr. Frazer from California. He had loaded his schooner and sent her to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and landed enough powder and muskets to load her again, but the temptation was too strong for the kanakas and they and a rascal of a white man, who was his trader, were robbing him of all
his stuff. He hired us to take his goods and himself over to Wooahooya to a bay where three white men lived. We did so. Mr. Frazer remained with us and is now on board and on his way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>.
</p><p>
We visited the islands of Wooahooya, Dominique, Woopo and Nukehua. At Woopo we remained five days. Mr. Frazer and myself stopped on shore at the house of a chief. There was a Catholic priest here. He had converted one family.
</p><p>
As our doings at one place were the same at all the others, I will describe this. Besides, these were the best people I met and the largest village and the prettiest girls and they raise more potatoes than the others. They are the finest potatoes I have ever seen.
</p><p>
We took the powder and muskets, cloth, knives, etc., ashore under the cocoanut trees near the beach and the natives brought their potatoes down in baskets made of cocoanut leaf and we bought them at the rate of 10 bbls for a keg of powder, five for a musket; giving four fathoms of cloth for a bbl or three knives and 24 flints, and one man wanted some paper to make cartridges so I gave him a novel for a bbl. We also got 30 bbls for an old boat.
</p><p>
All the inhabitants, except the men digging, were assembled on the beach having a holiday. The girls were dressed out in their best robes of tappa with wreaths of flowers in their glossy black hair and large bunches of poseys stuck through a hole in their ears. They were seated round in circles singing and beating time with two sticks. This they call 'Hoolah Hoolah.' It is a kind of monotonous chant. They also have a passion for 'titaboos' (Jewsharps) and play this instrument very well. Some dozen men were having a 'Hoolah Hoolah' and accompanied their singing with three drums, making a terrible noise. The piccaninnies were amusing themselves playing in the surf. The missionary girls, dressed in loose
gowns, kept away from the heathen as the Padre did not allow them to sing anything except hymns.
</p><p>
We had no rows nor confusion. Every man had his own pile and they gave good measure and were all satisfied with their bargains. When they got a keg of powder in their arms, they would dance for joy. The cloth all went to the ladies. I had rather trade with them than with the Western Hoosiers. They are more civilized and know more in every way.
</p><p>
At night we walked up to the village about half a mile from the beach. Here our worthy host had a sumptuous supper prepared for us: roast pig, roast breadfruit mashed up and eaten with cocoanut milk, very much like pudding and milk, fish roasted in leaves, sweet potatoes, bananas, etc. Everything was clean. The house was built of bamboos thatched with leaves and is paved with smooth stone and well furnished with mats, rolls of tappa, trays, etc. For candles they use a nut like a filbert strung on a stick. They are so full of oil that they burn well. Here four men and their wives lived, besides any quantity of hogs and pigs occasionally getting in. The wife of the master of the house and her sister were two of the finest looking women I saw on the islands. They were named 'Tiheah' and 'Teikah.'
</p><p>
They treated us with the utmost hospitality and in return we gave the men each a musket and the ladies, calico, beads and Jewsharps. We lay here five days and bought 200 bbls of potatoes. Our friends parted with a great deal of regret. Carboutoo, one of our passengers, found some of her friends here and took her traps ashore and stopped. We paid the King five fathoms of cloth for anchoring in his water, as he called the bay.
</p><p>
From here we went to Nukehua, the largest island of the group. The French have a settlement at one bay. We anchored in Typee Bay. Perhaps you have read
</p><p>
Melville's work 'Typee.' This was the same bay that he lived in. Some of the white men living here recollect him. I inquired of the natives through Dan for 'Fayaway' but could not hear of her.
</p><p>
The scenery there was beautiful. There is one large bay and four small ones opening into it. Here we had the same crowd of natives swimming off to the schooner and the same entertainments on shore, only that the natives were more numerous and more inclined to cheat. Here we got 100 bbls of potatoes, fowls and cocoanuts, etc. Dan and his wife and Typu left us here as they were at home.
</p><p>
We got under way and stood for Tahiti. We were twenty five days among this group. I can hardly realize that the natives are the bloodthirsty savages they are represented to be. They are not cannibals and they appear to be kind and good-natured, never quarrelling among themselves. Although I always went armed I felt perfectly secure with them. They will never harm you if you do not give them cause. They put perfect confidence in the whites and sometimes they have been cheated. Their girls have been kidnappedand carried off. They have some honor and know when a man tells them a lie! We always kept our word to them and the exception of their stealing a few articles they treated us well.
</p><p>
On our way to Tahiti we stopped at the little island of Metia and got some fowls, cocoanuts, etc. On the morning of the fifth day we were in sight of the island. The lofty peak of Oroohuna rises to the heighth of 8500 feet and can be seen a great distance.
</p><p>
I had read and heard so much about Tahiti that my anticipations were pitched pretty high but I was not disappointed. On the contrary,the beauty of the scenery far exceeded my fancy. The island is enclosed in a coral reef, which is marked by a line of white foam. Inside it
it is as smooth as a lake. This reef, as Wise beautifully describes it is: 'No ungainly ledge of black jagged rocks but a smooth parapet of coral just beneath the surface with the outer face like a bulwark of adamant, where the swelling billows vainly expend their rage and then bubble rippling over in a liquid fringe of creamy foam.' You can read better descriptions from Wilkes and especially from Wise's narative called 'Los Gringos,' than I can give you, so I will not attempt it.
