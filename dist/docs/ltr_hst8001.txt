Commodore : In compliance with your verbal instructions to examine and report upon the condition of the public horses turned over to me, for the use of C Company, First Dragoons, I 
have the honor to state that, in my opinion, not one of the horses referred to is fit for dragoon service, being too poor and weak for any such purpose ; also, that the company of dragoons 
under my command can do much better service on foot than mounted on those horses. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with high respect, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>

Captain First Dragoons, Commanding Company C.
