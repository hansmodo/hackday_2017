DEAR SIR, The Convention continue to sit, and have been 
closely employed since the commencement of the session. I am 
still under the mortification of being restrained from disclosing 
any part of their proceedings. As soon as I am at liberty, I 
will endeavour to make amends for my silence, and if I ever 
have the pleasure of seeing you, shall be able to give you pretty 
full gratification. I have taken lengthy notes of everything 
that has yet passed, and mean to go on with the drudgery, if no 
indisposition obliges me to discontinue it. It is not possible to 
form any judgment of the future duration of the session. I am 
led by sundry circumstances to guess that the residue of the 
work will not be very quickly despatched. The public mind is 
very impatient for the event, and various reports are circulating which tend to inflame curiosity. I do not learn, however, 
that any discontent is expressed at the concealment; and have 
little doubt that the people will be as ready to receive as we 
shall be able to propose a Government that will secure their 
liberties and happiness. 
</p><p>
I am not able to give you any account of what is doing at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Your correspondents there will no doubt supply 
the omission. The paper money here ceased to circulate very 
suddenly a few days ago. It had been for some time vibrating 
between a depreciation of 12 and of 20 per cent. Its entire 
stagnation is said to have proceeded from a combination of a 
few people with whom the country people deal on market days 
against receiving it. The consequence was that it was refused 
in the market, and great distress brought on the poorer citizens. Some of the latter began in turn to form combinations of 
a more serv.us nature, in order to take revenge on the supposed 
authors of the stagnation. The timely interposition of some 
influential characters prevented a riot, and prevailed on the 
persons who were opposed to the paper to publish their willingness to receive it. This has stifled the popular rage, and got 
the paper into circulation again. It is, however, still considerably below par, and must have received a wound which will not 
easily be healed. Nothing but evil springs from this imaginary 
money wherever it is tried, and yet the appetite for it where it 
has not been tried continues to be felt. There is great reason 
to fear that the bitterness of the evil must be tasted in Virginia 
before the appetite there will be at an end.

The wheat harvest throughout the continent has been uncommonly fine, both in point of quantity and quality. The crops 
of corn and Tobacco on the ground in Virginia are very different in different places. I rather fear that in general they are 
both bad, particularly the former. I have just received a letter 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>, which complains much of appearances in that 
neighborhood, but says nothing of them in the parts adjacent. 
</p><p>
Present my best respects to Mr. Short and Mr. Mazzei. Nothing has been done since my last to the latter with regard to his 
affair with Dorman. 
</p><p>
Wishing you all happiness, I am, dear sir, your affectiona-te 
friend and serv.
