REV SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Favour of June 14, with several Copies 
of your Observations of the Transit of Venus, for which I 
thank you. I have sent one of them to M r Maskelyne as you 
desired, with an Extract from your Letter, and another to 
Paris, I have not yet obtained from him the Estimate he 
promised me, but hope to have it soon ; tho' by what I hear 
from others I begin to fear the Expense will be thought too 
heavy for us. I shall send the new Volume of the Transactions to M rB Franklin, where you will find what Observations have been received and published here. I am, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Reverend Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient 
</p><p>
humble Servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
