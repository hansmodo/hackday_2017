Dear Christman:--I am glad to hear you are in such
good spirits and that there is a strong probability of soon grasping you by the hand. Well, come on. We will try and receive you.
</p><p>
I am kept busy almost night and day in the Record office. I have made much more liberal arrangements with Mr. Evans and am now quite well paid for my work. I am entirely satisfied.
</p><p>
Dear fellow, my single days are numbered. I will be married on the evening of the 18th inst. to Sallie. The affair will take place quietly, in the presence of a few reliable friends. When I go to housekeeping, I will probably occupy the editor's small house, on High Street. I mean to enjoy life. I go into the matter coolly and thinkingly--not with the wild enthusiasm of youth. But I will tell you in my next how I get through.
</p><p>
Please excuse the brevity of this letter. I am too busy to write more.
