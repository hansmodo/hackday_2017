FROM GENERAL HALLECK TO <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">GENERAL U. S. GRANT</a>.
</p><p>
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON<br/>
</p><p>
January 21, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.
</p><p>
MAJOR-GENERAL GRANT, Memphis.
</p><p>
GENERAL:--The President has directed that so much of Arkansas as you
may desire to control be temporarily attached to your department.
This will give you control of both banks of the river.
</p><p>
In your operations down the Mississippi you must not rely too
confidently upon any direct co-operation of General Banks and the
lower flotilla, as it is possible that they may not be able to pass
or reduce Port Hudson. They, however, will do everything in their
power to form a junction with you at Vicksburg.  If they should not
be able to effect this, they will at least occupy a portion of the
enemy's forces, and prevent them from reinforcing Vicksburg. I hope,
however, that they will do still better and be able to join you.
</p><p>
It may be proper to give you some explanation of the revocation of
your order expelling all Jews from your department. The President
has no objection to your expelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which,
I suppose, was the object of your order; but as it in terms
proscribed an entire religious class, some of whom are fighting in
our ranks, the President deemed it necessary to revoke it.
</p><p>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
</p><p>
H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.
