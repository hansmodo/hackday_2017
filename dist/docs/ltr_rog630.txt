My dear Friend
</p><p>
You will doubtless be surprized at what may appear like my infirmity of purpose. But finding it impossible to get out from this port I have remained here. Eagerly looking for some lifting of the clouds which hang over us and have finally concluded to put off my trip for another month for the reason that I cannot make up my mind to leave until things look less gloomy. For even with my sanguin hopeful spirit what can I say when asked about our prospects - but thus we
are retreating every where and every where sorely pressed I have never felt so little hopeful in my life. The Yankees have attacked their plan with a determination to take it and however long we try [to] keep them in check I believe they will eventually take it. We have repulsed them with heavy loss, but they do not mind this and renewed the attack in [illegible] We cannot get at them and are obliged to meet them at their own selected places. Beauregard is all energy and resources seem to have developed by his great genius but alas he cannot make big guns and without them the city must fall. With this dread
anticipation I cannot go away. I shall go to Wilmington tomorrow. Inform them after a day or two to my friend Mrs. Alexander in Mecklinburg Co. and shall hope to hear from you and see you that is if you still retain a desire to take a little trouble to see me. I have been very kindly treated here and have seen much of Beauregard who is the most interesting person I ever saw. Grand in his simplicity indeed he is.

I mentioned you much of interest about my trip here. Which I shall be always glad to have made. I remain over today in order to go to Fort Sumpter. The bombardment will hit her to interfere with every plan for doing so. And I have an intense desire to see that famous spot which has played such a conspicuous part in the deaded drain of death. My heart is oppressed by the atmosphere of this place [illegible] is here. I will write to you after I reach my final destination. As you will know my friend this same regard I have for you. I [illegible] that you are again obliged to [illegible] your [illegible]. With my best wishes ever,
</p><p>
Your friend
