My Dear Brother: Your recent letters have been received. One of them I read to Secretary Cameron, and 
he was much pleased with some of your ideas, especially 
with your proposition about Fort Smith and the island off 
Mobile. The latter is probably now in possession of the 
government. 
</p><p>
It is probable that no movements will be made into the 
cotton States before winter. A regular plan has been 
formed by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague met">General Scott</a>, and is daily discussed and reconsidered by him and other officers. The movements now 
occurring are merely incidental, rather to occupy public 
attention and employ troops than to strike decisive blows. 
In the meantime it is becoming manifest that the secessionists mean to retreat from position to position until 
they concentrate sufficient force to strike a decisive blow. 
I have a fear not generally shared in that now a rapid 
concentration is taking place and that we will, within a 
few days, have a terrible battle near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. Indeed, 
I don't see how it can be avoided. General Butler at 
Norfolk, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">General McClellan</a> at Grafton, General Patterson at Charlesborough, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague met">General Scott</a> here, all concentrating, will surely bring on a fight in which I fear the 
Virginians will concentrate the largest mass. I have 
been all along our lines on the other side, and confess 
that we are weaker than I wish. Every day, however, is 
adding to our mass and strengthening our position. . . .

What think you of Fremont and Banks as Major-Generals of Volunteers and Schenck as Brigadier? They 
are all able men, though I know you don't like volunteers. These appointments are generally satisfactory, 
even to the regular officers, many of whom say that they 
had rather serve under able citizens than old-fogy officers. 
The old army is a manifest discredit. The desertion of 
so many officers (treachery I had better say), the surrender on parole in Texas of so many officers where all 
the men were true to their allegiance, has so stained the 
whole regular course of officers that it will take good 
conduct on their part to retrieve their old position. 
</p><p>
You are regarded with favor here. It will be your 
own fault if you do not gain a very high position in the 
army. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
