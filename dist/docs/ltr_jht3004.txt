SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 2d instant was 
delivered to me last night. This afternoon I received <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> s, of the 31st of August. 
He has ordered the lead to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, with directions 
to forward it by the most direct route to your camp. 
</p><p>
We are infested by ministerial ships and transports. I gave your Commissary-General a narrative 
yesterday, and beg leave to refer you to him, from 
the haste of this express. Our coasts are kept in 
continual alarm. Three ships of war, with thirteen 
other vessels of divers sorts, were seen off Fisher's 
Island, and in the Sound, yesterday. They have 
gained no provisions from the main. Have heard 
nothing from Montauk, or any part of Long Island. 
New London is in great fears, and Stonington expects another attack. I have ordered the new-raised 
levies to guard and defend those two places, and 
the coasts as far as Connecticut River. There are 
likewise four companies of them beyond the river, for defence in those parts. This appears absolutely necessary for their security at present. Hope this use 
of them, till these dangers are over, will neither injure nor hinder any of your operations. 
</p><p>
Whether these are the same ships your Excellency noticed us of, remains uncertain. Yesterday, ordered 
the best intelligence to be gained, to render that matter more certain. 
</p><p>
Lord's day morning, constrained by the weather, came into the harbour at New London a schooner, taken by the Rose, Captain Wallace, at Stonington; 
four hands on board ; one, a white man, sent to Windham gaol; the other three, negroes, two belonging to <a href='/results.php?tla=nic' rel='colleague'>Governor Cooke</a> and one to Newport, ordered to be 
returned to their masters, and the schooner to her owner. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>'s army is moved forward a few days will determine the event. 
</p><p>
I have ordered our Commissaries in the several counties to send to your camp all the hunting shirts they can procure. I am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, your very obedient and 
</p><p>
Most humble servant, 
</p><p>
