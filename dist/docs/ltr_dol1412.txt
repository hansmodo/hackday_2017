BELOVED SISTER <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, Mrs. Mason has just written to me to say you are a 
little better, and those dear daughters of yours, Mary and Dolly, whom I shall ever 
feel are my own children, have often consoled me by their letters since you were 
unable to write. Your husband and boys too have written frequently, all in that 
affectionate feeling towards you which manifested their deep love ; and although 
my heart is sad within me, because I cannot see or assist you in your long and pain 
ful sickness, yet am I very thankful to the Almighty for his favors in bestowing such 
devoted friends as have surrounded your pillow. 
</p><p>
My dear husband is recovering, I hope, slowly, though still confined to his bed. 
He speaks of you to me every day with all the partiality and love of a tender 
brother, and ardently hopes that we may be long spared to each other. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Clay and her husband did not call to see me as we expected. They understood that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="friend met">General Jackson</a> was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a> and passed on to Governor Barbour's. 
The next day Mr. Clay came for a few hours, but did not meet the President here. 
I regretted much not seeing Mrs. Clay, as she would have talked to me of you. 
</p><p>
Do, dear sister, strive to get well and strong for my sake and your children's ; 
what should we do without you ! As soon as my eyes are well I will write to dear 
Mrs. B. In the mean time offer her my love and thanks for all her goodness to you. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear, ever and always, 
</p><p>
Your loving sister, 
</p><p>
