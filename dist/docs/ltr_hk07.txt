Sunnyvale, Calif. <br> Sept. 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> <br><br> My dear Horace, <br> Your letter dated Aug. 25th and mailed Sept 1st read Thursday also one written 
Sept. 1 and sent the 6th rec’d Monday of this week. I often wonder where all the 
letters go that are written to the boys over there and apparently are not rec’d. 
Certainly the soldiers mail service is a disgrace to the [unintelligible] U.S. 
You should have rec’d 4 letters from me at Camp Merrit, one with 2 pictures of 
the house when the roses were in bloom. Let me know if you did not get them and 
i will send you others of the same. But i suppose it can’t be helped where there 
are so many million letters to look over - the last comes first and the first 
comes last. That was a very interesting incident your meeting Gussie[?] Appleman[?] 
and very surprising that you should remember hsi face after all these years. Your 
father remembers about them - but I do not only [unintelligible] sounds very familiar. 
Pa has the barn packed full of hay that he has dried and saved for his own use. 
So the hay that is in Mr. Thompkin’s barn and got no wetting may be sold for full 
price. I notice Mr. Cooley has sold his to Mr. Carlyle and they are hauling it 
away now I don’t suppose they got very much for it got [unintelligible] 2 [unintelligible] 
wetting spread out and every night a fog like rain and no sun over half a day. 
The indications are that we shall soon get another rain. Such a strange season 
for Calif. I believe I have dried a hundred lbs of apples, pears, and peaches 
and am now drying figs and a few lbs of walnuts. They are both extra good this 
year. Mr. Schumacher is hard at work on the Thompkins house. The ladies of the 
family do not know just what they want so they are constantly changing. The matter 
came to a final [unintelligible] the other day when Mrs. T. made the remark that 
12x12 would be a very small bedroom. Mr. T. said he said he threw down his tools 
and told her to find out what she did want and he’s tear it out and make it just 
as she said. If I know anything about it she must have been scared into thinking 
anything would do. Mrs. C.[?] and i have a little laugh to ourselves for we have 
had a little experience with Mr. T.’s temper. This is all non-sense Horace but 
really I have nothing to write for after I have told you all the little things 
that happen on the place there is no more which makes a letter rather short. Sept. 
28 Will finish this up and get it off. Am so glad that you keep well. You must 
take good care of your health and keep in good spirits for that is what is need 
to carry you thru. Father sends love and best wishes. God keep you safe my dear 
boy. Your Loving Mother Mrs. Deming just came in to see me a few minutes. Mr. 
Watson has sold his crop of apples for $600 on the ground and in the trees to 
a man who buys for the S.J. market. Mrs. Deming sends her kindest regards and 
hopes you will come safe home. She hand knitted 60 pairs of socks for the R.C. 
Do you boys have to pay for everything you get from the R.C.? My neighbor says 
everything is a free gift and should be free for them.
