</p><p>
HON. SECRETARY OF WAR.
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR:--I have received additional despatches, which, with
former ones, induce me to believe we should revoke or suspend the
order suspending the Chicago Times; and if you concur in opinion,
please have it done.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
