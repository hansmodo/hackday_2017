MY DEAR MR. CORBIN:
</p><p>
As I telegraphed you Mr. Dent breathed his last at 11.45 last night.
There was nothing during the day or evening to indicate his near
approach to death more than there has been almost every day for the
last five months. Indeed, and I believe for the first time since our
return from Long Branch, he had himself partially dressed yesterday,
ate a hearty breakfast, sitting up, and smoked his cigar with apparent
relish. In the evening Mrs. Grant, Fred. and I were out until after 11
P.M., perfectly unconscious that his end was near. On our return we
found his attending physician with him, and he, Mr. Dent, apparently in
a quiet slumber. Not many minutes after he ceased to breathe and life
was gone without a struggle or movement of a limb or muscle. It was a
clear case of life worn out purely by time,--no disease, care or
anxiety hastening dissolution.
</p><p>
On Thursday there will be funeral service at the house, by Dr. Tiffany,
and at 11.30 his remains will leave the B. & P. Depot for St. Louis.
The funeral there will be on Saturday next; and Mrs. Dent's remains
will be brought up from the farm at the same time, and the two interred
in Mr. Dent's lot in Bellefontaine. Dr. Sharp, Mr. Casey, Gen. Dent,
Fred. Grant and myself, will accompany them.
</p><p>
During all the time Mr. Dent has been confined to his room, and at all
times before when he was in the least unwell since we have been in the
White House--Dr. Bazil Norris of the army has been most attentive. I
feel disposed to recognize my appreciation of his attention in some
way, and have thought if I could get about such a watch as was made for
me at the establishment near Jersey City I would get that. If it is not
asking too much of you to enquire I would like you to do so. If it can
be got before Christmas you might order it at once, with the Doctor's
monogram-- from his friend U.S. Grant --. If it cannot be had by that
time I would not order it until further directed.
</p><p>
My children will all be at home by Thursday, unless it may be Bucky.
The family are well, or as well as could be expected.--We would be very
glad to see you here on Thursday, as an old friend of Mr. Dent, but do
not ask that you should undergo the fatigue of the trip unless you feel
well enough to do so.
</p><p>
Very truly yours,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
