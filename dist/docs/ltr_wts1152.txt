WALNUT HILLS, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, May 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>. 
</p><p>
My Dear Brother: I received a few days since your 
most acceptable letter of May 7th, which met me here. 
You will now have a fine understanding of the whole 
move thus far. The move by way of Grand Gulf to 
secure a foothold on the hills wherefrom to assail <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, appeared to me too risky at the time, and General 
Grant is entitled to all the merit of its conception and 
execution. 
</p><p>
In our route we consumed the fruits of the country, 
broke up the important railroad communications, whipped 
the enemy wherever encountered, and secured the Yazoo 
as a base, the object for which we have contended so long 
and so patiently. . . . 
</p><p>
We have <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> closely invested, and its fate is 
sealed unless the enemy raises a large force from Carolina and Tennessee and assails us from without. In that 
event we must catch them at the crossing of Black, and 
fight them desperately. 
</p><p>
The place is very well fortified, and is defended by 
twenty thousand bravo troops. We have assaulted at 
five distinct points at two distinct times, and failed to 
cross the parapet. Our loss was heavy and we are now 
approaching with pick and shovel. If we did not apprehend an attempt on our rear, we could wait patiently 
the slow process of besiegers ; but as this danger is great, 
we may try and assault again. In the mean time we are 
daily pouring into the city a perfect storm of shot and 
shells, and our sharp-shooters are close up and fire at any 
head that is rash enough to show itself above ground.
