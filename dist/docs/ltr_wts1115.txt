Dear Brother: Before receiving yours of the 7th, I 
had addressed a letter to Governor Moore at Baton 
Rouge, of which this is a copy : 
</p><p>
"Sir : As I occupy a quasi military position under the 
laws of the State, I deem it proper to acquaint you that 
I accepted such position when Louisiana was a State in 
the Union and when the motto of this seminary was 
inscribed in marble over the main door : 'By the liberality 
of the General Government. The Union Esto perpetua.' 
Recent events foreshadow a great change, and it becomes 
all men to choose. If Louisiana withdraw from the 
Federal Union, I prefer to maintain my allegiance to the 
old constitution as long as a fragment of it survives, and 
my longer stay here would be wrong in every sense of 
the word. In that event I beg that you will send or 
appoint some authorized agent to take charge of the 
arms and munitions of war here belonging to the State 
or advise me what disposition to make of them. And 
furthermore, as President of the Board of Supervisors, 
I beg you to take immediate steps to relieve me as 
superintendent the moment the State determines to secede ; for on no earthly account will I do any act or 
think any thought hostile to or in defiance of the United 
States. 
</p><p>
"With respect, etc. 
</p><p>

I regard the seizure by Governor Moore of the United 
States Arsenal as the worst act yet committed in the 
present revolution. I do think every allowance should 
be made to Southern politicians for their nervous anxiety 
about their political power and the safety of slaves. I 
think that the constitution should be liberally construed 
in their behalf, but I do regard this civil war as precipitated with undue rapidity. ... It is inevitable. All 
the legislation now would fall powerless on the South. 
You should not alienate such States as Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri. My notion is that this 
war will ruin all politicians, and that military leaders 
</p><p>
will direct the events. 
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
W. T. S.
