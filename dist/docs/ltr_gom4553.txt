Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter of the seventh will have communicated what 
passed with the Duke of Leeds respecting the business you 
committed to rne. I take the liberty to mention here, that from 
his countenance and manner on the perusal of your letter, he 
seemed to derive from it that sort of pleasure, which a man 
feels at the removal of something, which every now and then 
brings to his mind disagreeable ideas. I do not exactly see 
from what cause this emotion was produced. By the eagerness 
of his subsequent expressions, I conjectured that the critical 
situation of Europe had excited some disquietude respecting 
the part, which the United States might take in case of a general war. What strengthened that idea, and perhaps led me to 
form it, was that in a chamber to which I was introduced previous 
to the audience, there was a large book of maps open at that 
part of Poland. But the silence since observed leads to a sus 
picion, that his satisfaction was derived from another source. I 
am told that in a late debate the ministers committed them 
selves by throwing out in pretty clear terms the idea, that some 
sort of treaty was on the carpet with America. And if so, the 
opening now given must have relieved them from the fear of 
future contradiction. 
</p><p>
I trouble you, my dear sir, with all this conjecture, because it 
is not impossible that circumstances may turn up on your side 
of the water, with which it may be useful to compare minutely 
what passes here. I am, &c.
