<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='1'>1</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>General  Hood's</a> an awful flatterer I mean an awkward flatterer. I told him to praise my husband to some one else, not to me. He ought to praise me to somebody who would tell my husband, and then praise 
my husband to another person who would tell me. Man and wife are too much one person to wave a compliment 
straight in the face of one about the other is not graceful.

One more year of Stonewall would have saved us. Chickamauga is the only battle we have gained since Stone 
wall died, and no results follow as usual. Stonewall was not so much as killed by a Yankee : he was shot by his own 
men ; that is hard. <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a> can do no more than keep back <a href='/results.php?tla=grm' rel=''>Meade</a>. " One of <a href='/results.php?tla=grm' rel=''>Meade's</a> armies, you mean," said I, 
" for they have only to double on him when <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> whips one 
of them."

General Edward Johnston says he got <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant</a> a place esprit de corps, you know. He could not bear to see an old 
army man driving a wagon; that was when he found him out West, put out of the army for habitual drunkenness. 
He is their right man, a bull-headed Suwarrow. He don't care a snap if men fall like the leaves fall ; he fights to win, 
that chap does. He is not distracted by a thousand side issues ; he does not see them. He is narrow and sure sees 
only in a straight line. Like Louis Napoleon, from a battle in the gutter, he goes straight up. Yes, as with <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a>, 
they have ceased to carp at him as a rough clown, no gentle man, etc. You never hear now of <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> nasty fun ; only 
of his wisdom. Doesn't take much soap arid water to wash 
the hands that the rod of empire sway. They talked of <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> drunkenness, too. Now, since Vicksburg they have 
not a word to say against <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant's</a> habits. He has the disagreeable habit of not retreating before irresistible veterans. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a> and Albert Sidney Johnston show blood and breeding. They are of the Bayard and Philip Sidney order 
of soldiers. Listen: if <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a> had had <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant's</a> resources he would have bagged the last Yankee, or have had 
them all safe back in Massachusetts. " You mean if he had not the weight of the negro question upon him? 
" No, I mean if he had <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant's</a> unlimited allowance of the powers of war men, money, ammunition, arms."

Mrs. Ould says <a href='/results.php?tla=mtl' rel=''>Mrs. Lincoln</a> found the gardener of the White House so nice, she would make him a major-general. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> remarked to the secretary: " Well, the little woman must have her way sometimes.

A word of the last night of the old year. l Gloria Mundi sent me a cup of strong, good coffee. I drank two cups 
and so I did not sleep a wink. Like a fool I passed my whole life in review, and bitter memories maddened me 
quite. Then came a happy thought. I mapped out a story of the war. The plot came to hand, for it was true. Johnny 
is the hero, a light dragoon and heavy swell. I will call it F. F.'s, for it is the F. F.'s both of South Carolina and 
Virginia. It is to be a war story, and the filling out of the skeleton was the best way to put myself to sleep.
