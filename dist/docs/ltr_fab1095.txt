On my passage up (from Bucksport) in the boat with no one on board I knew, I came very near being homesick. The pleasant hours which I had spent especially at your house and all the associations connected, came over me and I actually felt attached to the place more than ever, and as I watched it fading away in the distance I determined, if circumstances will permit, to make a pilgrimage to it once a year. The friends I have there are friends indeed, I believe, and I felt more regret at parting than when I left before. However, it is not my nature to remain lonely. I observed a young girl come on board from Belfast, alone. She was sitting near me and looked
as if she wanted me to break the ice. I commenced talking with her and she soon told me her story. She lived in Northport and was going to Boston on a visit with her parents. I told her that I had also left my home to seek my fortune, which so enlisted her sympathies that she kindly presented me with a 'Pond Lilly.' 'Oh woman, etc.' Finding her superlatively green, I retired to my berth to ruminate on the past and live over again the 'moments snatched from Paradise,' which I enjoyed at Bucksport ever since that memorable evening when I assisted that angelic form over the fort. But I must not indulge in such foolish fancies. Give my love to Father and Mother and believe me, Yours infernally.
