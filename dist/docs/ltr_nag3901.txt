DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter yesterday to Col. Maham is this moment handed to me. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Lieut. Col. Laurens</a> joined us the night before last, and I have heard 
nothing further of the enemy's attack upon us. While the light troops 
were absent, I was a little apprehensive; but on their return, I feel 
perfectly easy. Enclosed I send you a copy of a letter from General Leslie, by which you will see what the poor inhabitants have to expect. 
I gave no other answer to it than by informing him that I had no control over civil Government, and directed him to the Governor and 
Council, who alone possessed powers competent to the business, and 
who would give him such an answer as the honor and interest of the 
Government required. If you could subsist with a flying party in the 
neighborhood of Strawberry, or anywhere between Cooper River and Santee, it would afford great protection to that part of the country. 
Our present position is so favorable for affording you support by a rapid 
march of our cavalry, that I much doubt whether the enemy will venture any bold enterprise against you; and if they should, if you move 
from day to day, and with your usual caution and address, as you are 
so perfectly acquainted with the country, you can easily avoid them 
</p><p>
until our cavalry can join you, and by fixing upon some place to meet 
at, you may form a junction with certainty and despatch. But, if you 
think your party will be too much exposed, you will take any position 
you may think their safety requires, giving the inhabitants as full notice 
as possible and all the negroes, also of the enemy's intentions to 
steal all the latter they can, and carry them off. If the negroes are 
advertised of the enemy's intentions, I think they will get but few of 
them. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
