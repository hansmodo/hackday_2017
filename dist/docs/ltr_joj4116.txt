Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Among my letters to Mr. Randolph, is one stating an 
agreement between <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> and myself for preserving things in a pacific and unaltered state, between us and 
the British on the side of Canada and the frontiers ; and 
Mr. Simcoe will soon receive orders to retire from Miami 
to his former positions. 
</p><p>
Some cabinet councils have lately been held, and it is 
probable the manner of settling their differences with us 
has been among the subjects of their deliberations. From 
the silence and circumspection of <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>, I apprehend that the cabinet has not as yet ultimately concluded 
on their plan. This delay is unpleasant, but I do not think 
it unnatural. The opposition members lately come in have 
so often held a language friendly to America, that it is probable they will find it necessary, in order to be consistent, to 
adhere to sentiments not agreeable to some of the others. 
</p><p>
I am led by several little circumstances, not easily detailed or explained, to believe that the late administration 
looked upon a war with us as inevitable ; and I am of opinion that the instructions of the 6th November were influenced by that idea. I do also believe that Lord Dorchester 
was instructed to act conformably to that idea, and that 
Simcoe was governed by it. 
</p><p>
I am certain that intelligence (which made some impression) was conveyed to the ministry, that our army, if successful against the Indians, had orders to attack and take 
the posts. There is also room to believe, that the indiscreet 
reception given to the late French minister â€” the unnecessary rejoicings about French successes, and a variety of 
similar circumstances, did impress the government with 
strong apprehensions of an unavoidable war with us, and 
did induce them to entertain a disposition hostile to us. 
</p><p>
I have given <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> positive assurances, that no 
attack [tending the negotiations will be made on the posts 
held by them at the conclusion of the war ; but I also told 
him that I thought it highly probable that every new advanced post, and particularly the one said to be taken by 
Mr. Simcoc on the Miami, would be attacked. I must do 
him the justice to say, that hitherto I have found him fair 
and candid, and apparently free from asperity or irritation. 
</p><p>
So far as personal attentions to the envoy may be regarded as symptoms of good-will to his country, my prospect is favourable. These symptoms, however, are never 
decisive : they justify expectation, but not reliance. 
</p><p>
I most heartily wish the business over, and myself at 
home again. But it would not be prudent to urge and 
press unceasingly, lest ill-humour should result, and illhumour will mar any negotiation ; on the other hand, much 
forbearance and seeming inactivity invite procrastination 
and neglect. The line between these extremes is delicate : 
I will endeavour to find and observe it. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
