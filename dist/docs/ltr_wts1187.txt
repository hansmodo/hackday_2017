Commander U. S. Army: 
</p><p>
Your despatch informing me that the order for the 
Atlantic Division was issued, and that I was assigned 
to its command, is received. 
</p><p>
I was in hopes I had escaped the danger, and now, 
were I prepared, should resign on the spot, as it requires 
no foresight to predict such must be the inevitable result 
in the end. 
</p><p>
I will make one more desperate effort by mail, which please await. 
</p><p>
(Signed) <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>,

Lieutenant- General.
