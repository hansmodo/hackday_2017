I have received yours, my dearest Payne, of the 23d and 24th of November, and was 
impatient fo answer them yesterday, the day of their reaching me, but owing to 
the winter arrangement for the mail, no post leaves this until to-morrow morning. 
Mr. Clay inquired affectionately after you ; he with two members of Congress have 
been passing several days with us. Everyone inquires after you ; but, my dear son, 
it seems to be the wonder of them all that you should stay away from us for so long 
a time ! and now I am ashamed to tell, when asked, how long my only child has 
been absent from the home of his mother. Your father and I entreat you to come to 
us ; to arrange your business with those concerned, so that you may return to them 
when necessary, and let us see you here as soon as possible with your interest and 
convenience. Your father thinks as I do, that it would be best for your reputation 
and happiness, as well as ours, that you should consult your parents on subjects of 
deep account to you, and that you would find it so on returning to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> at 
the appointed time, which shall be when ever you wish it. I have said in my late 
letters, as well as this, all that I thought sufficient to influence you. I must now put my trust in God alone ! . . . 
</p><p>
I can add no news that is likely to interest you, except about poor Judge Todd, 
who is very ill ; and that Ellen Randolph is to be married to Mr. Coolidge. We 
should rejoice in any occurrence that would bring you speedily to our arms, who 
love you with inexpressible tenderness and constancy. 
</p><p>
Your own MOTHER.
