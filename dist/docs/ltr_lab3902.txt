SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours from Watbo I answered, ind expect it will be handed you 
with this, as also yours from land's Ferry, of the 26th, is just come 
to my hands. One-third of my regiment 1 have under orders to join 
you, and expect with this will come in about fifty men, in addition to 
Major Thomas division, and those that may remain behind I will send 
with all possible expedition, so that if in my power the public service 
may not be hindered. As to the men's being relieved monthly, it is so late 
now that it will be impossible for me to get them in camp until near the 
middle of the ensuing month. I am very sensible that it will make a 
considerable confusion in the regiment, as the men do not look upon 
themselves liable to go to camp yet, and the law will not oblige them until 
each division does two months duty agreeably to law ; therefore, I must 
beg to be excused in that particular, and I will send relief early in 
October, when their tour will be out, according to law. 
</p><p>
I remain, with all due regard, your most obedient servant,
