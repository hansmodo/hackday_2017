DEAR SIR, On the question to-day for previous amendments, the votes stood 80 ayes, 88 noes. On the final question, 
the ratification passed 89 ayes, 79 noes. Subsequent amendments will attend the act, but are yet to be settled. The temper of the minority will be better known to-morrow. The proceedings have been without flaw, or pretext of it, and there is 
no doubt that acquiescence, if not cordiality, will be manifested 
by the unsuccessful party. Two of the leaders, however, betray 
the effect of the disappointment, so far as it is marked in their 
countenances.

In haste, yrs.
