I HAVE but yesterday received yours of October 21. 
Your letters of the following dates I have received, 8 
and 10, 16, 29 September ; 1, 9, 21 and 22 October. I 
These letters, and indeed every line from you, give 
me inexpressible pleasure, notwithstanding the melancholy scenes described in most of them of late. I 
am happy to learn that the family is in health once for three of these letters. Extracts only from the rest were 
given in the Memoir, for reasons there stated, pp. zlii. ct seq. 
more, and hope it will continue. My duty to my 
mother. I wish she would not be concerned about 
me. She ought to consider, that a dysentery can kill 
as surely as a cannon. This town is as secure from 
the cannon and men of war as the moon is. I wish 
she had a little of your fortitude. I had rather be 
killed by a ball than live in such continual fears as she does.

I can't write as often as I wish. I am engaged 
from seven in the morning till eleven at night 
</p><p>
Two pair of colors, belonging to the seventh regiment, were brought here last night from Chambly, and 
hung up in Mrs. Hancock's chamber with great splendor and elegance. That lady sends her compliments 
and good wishes. Among a hundred mea, almost, at this house, she lives and behaves with modesty, decency, dignity and discretion, I assure you. Her 
behaviour is easy and genteel. She avoids talking 
upon politics. In large and mixed companies she is 
totally silent, as a lady ought to be ; but whether her 
eyes are so penetrating, and her attention so quick to 
the words, looks, gestures, sentiments, &c., of the 
company, as yours would be, saucy as you are this way, I won t say. 
</p><p>
But to resume a more serious subject You ask me 
to write to your father and sister, and my heart wishes 
and longs to do it, but you can have no conception 
what there is to prevent me. I really fear I shall ruin myself for want of exercise.
