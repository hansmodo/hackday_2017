MY DEAREST FRIEND.

WE arrived here last night, or rather yesterday, at 
one o clock, and here we dined and slept. The 
building is in a state to be habitable, and now we 
wish for your company. The account you give of

I have seen only Mr. Marshall and Mr. Stoddert, 
General Wilkinson and the two commissioners, Mr. Scott and Mr. Thornton. I shall say nothing of public 
affairs. I am very glad you consented to come on, 
for you would have been more anxious at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> 
than here, and I, to all my other solicitudines mordaces, as Horace calls them, i. e., " biting cares," 
should have added a great deal on your account. 
Besides, it is fit and proper that you and I should re 
tire together, and not one before the other. Before I 
end my letter, I pray heaven to bestow the best of 
blessings on this house, and on all that shall hereafter 
inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever 
rule under this roof ! I shall not attempt a description of it. You will form the best idea of it from inspection. 
Mr. Briesler is very anxious for the arrival of the 
man and women, and I am much more so for that of 
the ladies. I am, with unabated confidence and affection, your
