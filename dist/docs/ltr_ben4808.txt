SIR, 
</p><p>
I duly received your Favours of the 4'? of October and the 
if' of November. It gave me Pleasure to hear, that tho' 
the Merchants had departed from their Agreement of NonImportation, the Spirit of Industry and Frugality was likely 
to continue among the People. I am obliged to you for your 
Concern on my Account. The Letters you mention gave 
great Offence here ; but that was not attended with the immediate ill Consequences to my Interest that seem to have been 
hoped for by those that sent Copies of them hither. 
</p><p>
If our Country People would well consider, that all they 
save in refusing to purchase foreign Gewgaws, & in making 
their own Apparel, being apply'd to the Improvement of 
their Plantations, would render those more profitable, as 
yielding a greater Produce, I should hope they would persist 
resolutely in their present commendable Industry and Frugality. And there is still a farther Consideration. The 
Colonies that produce Provisions grow very fast: But of 
the Countries that take off those Provisions, some do not increase at all, as the European Nations ; and others, as the West 
India Colonies, not in the same proportion. So that tho' 
the Demand at present may be sufficient, it cannot long continue so. Every Manufacturer encouraged in our Country, 
makes part of a Market for Provisions within ourselves, 
and saves so much Money to the Country as must otherwise 
be exported to pay for the Manufactures he supplies. Here 
in England it is well known and understood, that whenever 
a Manufacture is established which employs a Number of 
Hands, it raises the Value of Lands in the neighbouring 
Country all around it; partly by the greater Demand near 
at hand for the produce of the Land; and partly from the 
Plenty of Money drawn by the Manufacturers to that part 
of the Country. It seems therefore the Interest of all our 
Farmers and Owners of Lands, to encourage our young 
Manufactures in preference to foreign ones imported among 
us from distant Countries. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged by your kind Present of curious Seeds. 
They were welcome Gifts to some of my Friends. I send 
you herewith some of the new Barley lately introduced into 
this Country, & now highly spoken of, I wish it may be 
found of Use with us. 
</p><p>
I was the more pleased to see in your Letter the Improvement of our Paper, having had a principal Share in establishing that Manufacture among us many Years ago, by the 
Encouragement I gave it. 
</p><p>
If in anything I can serve you here, it will be a Pleasure to 
Your obliged Friend 
</p><p>
and humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B FRANKLIN.
