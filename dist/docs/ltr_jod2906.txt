You have had many rumors propagated among you 
which I suppose you know not how to account for. 
One was, that Congress, the last summer, had tied the 
hands of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, and would not let him 
fight, particularly on the White plains. This report 
was totally groundless. Another was, that at last, 
Congress untied the General, and then he instantly 
fought and conquered at Trenton. This also was 
without foundation, for as his hands were never tied, 
so they were not untied. Indeed, within a few days 
past, a question has been asked Congress, to the surprise, I believe, of every member there, whether the 
General was bound by the advice of a council of war ? 
No member of Congress, that I know of, ever harbored or conceived such a thought. " Taking the ad 
vice of a council of war " are the words of the General's instructions, but this meant only, that councils 
of war should be called and their opinions and reasons demanded, but the General, like all other commanders of armies, was to pursue his own judgment after all.

Another report, which has been industriously circulated, is, that the General has been made by Congress, 
dictator. But this is as false as the other stories. Congress, it is true, upon removing to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, gave 
the General power to raise fifteen battalions, in addition to those which were ordered to be raised before, 
and to appoint the officers, and also, to raise three thousand horse, and to appoint their officers, and also, 
to take necessaries for his army, at an appraised value. But no more. Congress never thought of making him 
dictator, or of giving him a sovereignty. I wish I could find a correspondent, who was idle enough to 
attend to every report, and write it to me. Such false news, uncont radio ted, does more or less harm. 
Such a collection of lies would be a curiosity for posterity.

The report you mention in your last, that the British administration had proposed to Congress a treaty 
and terms, is false, and without a color. On the contrary, it is now more than ever p&lt;.st a douht, that their 
fixed determination is, conquest and unconditional subjugation. But there will be many words and blows 
too, before they will accomplish their wishes. Poor, abandoned, infatuated nation ! Infatuation is one of 
the causes to which great historians ascribe many events, and if it ever produced any effect, it has produced this war against America.

Arnold, who carries this, was taken in his passage from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. He sailed with Harden for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. They 
took fifteen vessels while he was on board the man of war. Your flour was highly favored with good luck.
