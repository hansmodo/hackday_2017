<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='18'>18th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Here I am, thank God, settled at the McLean's, in a clean, comfortable room, airy and cozy. 
With a grateful heart I stir up my own bright wood fire. My bill for four days at this splendid hotel here was $240, 
with $25 additional for fire. But once more my lines have fallen in pleasant places.

As we came up on the train from Charlotte a soldier took out of his pocket a filthy rag. If it had lain in the gutter 
for months it could not have looked worse. He unwrapped the thing carefully and took out two biscuits of the species 
known as hard tack. Then he gallantly handed me one, and with an ingratiating smile asked me "to take some." 
Then he explained, saying, " Please take these two; swap with me ; give me something softer that I can eat ; I am very 
weak still." Immediately, for his benefit, my basket of luncheon was emptied, but as for his biscuit, I would not 
choose any. Isabella asked, "But what did you say to him when he poked them under your nose ?" and I replied, I 
held up both hands, saying, "I would not take from you anything that is yours far from it ! I would not touch 
them for worlds."

A tremendous day's work and I helped with a will ; our window glass was all to be washed. Then the brass andirons were to be polished. After we rubbed them bright how pretty they were.

Presently Ellen would have none of me. She was scrubbing the floor. " You go dat's a good missis an stay to Miss Isabella's till de flo dry. I am very docile now, and I obeyed orders.
