During the greater part of the day a thick heavy fog or mist hung over the sea, making the day damp and disagreeable.
<p></p>
Yesterday the cooks killed two fine pigs, but as they did not scald them properly, they were unable to take the hair all off. They were therefore compelled to shave the pigs. This morning they cut off the outside of the hams and shoulders and cooked the remaining part for breakfast for the upper cabin. At noon they made us a sea pie of the skins mixed with some salt beef, since they had used the meat for the upper cabin. We ate the better part of it and then scooped out some of the larger pieces of this skin thickly set with hair an inch long, and placed it on a plate and carried this dainty dish on deck for the inspection of the Captain and the other passengers. Some indignation was felt and some threats made. The Captain blamed all upon the cooks and gave us orders to go "tear out the cooks and give them a dd good lashing." This he had done before but we thought he was the one to correct abuses and therefore respectfully declined. The seamen had even a worse mess served up to them and they too complained to the Captain, and the order that had been given to us was repeated to them. They required no second telling, but at it they went. They made a rush for the galley, took out the assistant cook and told him to be quiet as they were not going to hurt him. They then seized the presiding genius by the hair. He commenced screaming in a most awful manner and endeavored to prevent them from getting him out. He propped his shoulders against the door, but he soon found this unavailing as they gave him a kick in the face that brought the "claret" and loosed his hold. By this time the whole ship had been alarmed and one of the Frenchmen who was scared half to death came running aft, shouting "Capitan! Capitan! Revolucion!" The seamen were about to give the cook
a complete flogging, which the fellow partially deserved, when the Captain reached the spot. Some explanation was made and the riot was stopped.
<p></p>
It is the opinion of many that the Captain is at the head of all this, and that he makes the cooks and stewards do all this dirty work and then pushes the blame on them. It is about in keeping with the double-facedness of the man.
