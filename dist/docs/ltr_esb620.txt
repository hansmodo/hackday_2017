My Darling:
</p><p>
I am still [...] hurt and worried by your telegram sent to Cleveland and forwarded to me from there to-day. If my treasury was a full one I should certainly leave baby with her aunty and go straight to Savannah for an explanation.
</p><p>
As it is I must wait the tardy coming of a letter
</p><p>
The full two telegrams have surprised and slightly vexed me - This one [...] to me for made me really unhappy.
</p><p>
If you are unhappy too. I am sorry: Will await your explanation as patiently as possible.
</p><p>
Baby still has a slight diarrhea but I do not think that with the care that she will receive it will prove anything serious. May follow her for some weeks as it did last summer. In the past week I have received just two letters from you - I think that your letters may have been delayed. `
</p><p>
Do you receive my letters regularly? I write nearly every day.
</p><p>
I may not write again until I receive an explanation of these telegrams which I trust will be very soon.
</p><p>
If baby is worse will write every day. May do so in any case.
</p><p>
If you had any possible objections to my making the trip to Cleveland why did you not make them known when I asked your opinion upon the matter some weeks [...] ago? Your mother felt as I did that it was necessary for me to have the advice of some skillful physicians in regard to my health and approved of my plan to consult Dr. Saunders. As I have before written you I believe that I have received substantial benefit thereby. I have not time to write more now and scarce feel like it if I had the time. I most heartily wish that I could be with you now if only for the space of one hour.
</p><p>
Bye Darling -

I love you a little this morning notwithstanding all your abuse by telegraph - are you willing to be forgiven?
</p><p>
Baby is no worse and I have written to the Dr. for special instructions in regard to her so I think you have no occasion to be [...] anxious about her - we can [...] expect her to go through this month without some little sickness. I do feel that God will spare her to us.
</p><p>
Did it not occur to you that I might be about leaving Cleveland when you sent your telegram? I had written you that I should return on Monday on at the very farthest on Thursday. I did return on Wed. the very day that you dispatched your [...]
</p><p>
I intended to write sister today telling her that I expect to leave here on the 9 and asking her to meet me in Chicago on the following Tuesday (or Wed. morning). Expect to pass the interval between [...] and [...] with my cousin - shall be quite disappointed if do not [...]
