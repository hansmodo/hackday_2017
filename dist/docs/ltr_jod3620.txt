MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YESTERDAY the President sent his carriage for me to 
go with the family to the theatre. The Rage and 
the Spoiled Child were the two pieces. It rained 
and the house was not full. I thought I perceived a 
little mortification. Mr. George Washington and his 
fair lady were with us. 
</p><p>
Yours of the 21st gives me a satisfactory account 
of farming. I think I would engage Billings if I 
could. I must leave it to you to give him what you 
think fit. There is no vessel up for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and seeds 
are very scarce and uncommonly dear. 
</p><p>
As to the subject of yours of the 20th, I am quite 
at my ease. I never felt less anxiety when any considerable change lay before me. Aut transit aut iinit. 
I transmigrate or come to an end. The question is 
between living at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> or at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> ; between 
great cares and small cares. I have looked into my 
self and see no meanness nor dishonesty there. I see 
weakness enough, but no timidity. I have no con 
cern on your account but for your health. A woman 
can be silent, when she will. 
</p><p>
After all, persuasion may overcome the inclination 
of the chief to retire. But, if it should, it will 
shorten his days, I am convinced. His heart is set 
upon it, and the turpitude of the Jacobins touches 
him more nearly than he owns in words. All the 
studied efforts of the federalists to counterbalance 
abuse by compliment don t answer the end. 
</p><p>
I suspect, but don t know, that Patrick Henry, <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, and <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hamilton</a>, will all be voted 
for. I ask no questions ; but questions are forced 
upon me. I have had some conversations purposely 
sought, in order, as I believe, indeed as I know, to 
convince me that the federalists had no thoughts of 
overleaping the succession. The only question that 
labors in my mind is, whether I shall retire with my 
file-leader ? I hate to live in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in summer, 
and I hate still more to relinquish my farm. I hate 
speeches, messages, addresses and answers, procla 
mations, and such affected, studied, constrained 
things. I hate levees and drawing rooms. I hate to 
speak to a thousand people to whom I have nothing 
to say. Yet all this I can do. But I am too old to 
continue more than one, or at most more than two 
heats, and that is scarcely time enough to form, con 
duct and complete any very useful system. 
</p><p>
Electioneering enough we shall have. The en 
closed scraps will shew specimens.
