TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 29 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, March 9 [19], <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
The course of affairs during the operation of so great a 
change as that which is taking place in this Republic naturally produces various extraordinary measures and regulations, some of which affect immediately more or less the 
interests of other nations. The dispositions of the new Administration are certainly very friendly towards the United States. 
They are not studious to contrive laws whose operation, 
though general in words, may point in reality against our 
commerce alone. They are not inclined to be employed as 
the instruments of others hate, to injure us from subserviency, and to throw every possible impediment in our way 
from submission to others rather than from malevolence 
against us. They are not the passive agents of a deliberate 
system to cramp the growth of the United States, and to 
delay as long as possible the inevitable day of their national 
power. They receive no impulse from external resentment 
or fear relative to the prosperity or the principles of the 
transatlantic Republic. But the necessities of their situation at the present moment have, in some instances, occasioned an interruption to the enjoyment of the neutral and stipulated rights of our fellow-citizens. 
</p><p>
A law was published some time since relative to the circulation of the French assignats, and containing also a prohibition under severe penalties against the exportation of specie 
from this province. It forbids all persons going out of its bounds from carrying any more with them than a sufficiency 
(to be ascertained by the municipalities of the place from whence they depart,) for the expenses of their intended 
journies. There are at this time several citizens of the 
United States at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> who arrived lately, bringing 
with them sums of money with the intention of proceeding 
into Germany upon pursuit of their commercial affairs, and 
they have not been able to obtain permission from the municipality to take with them the money they brought here, 
upon the supposition that it is forbidden by the law before 
mentioned. Upon meeting with the difficulty from the 
municipality, Mr. Bourne wrote me requesting me to make 
application on the subject to the government here. 
</p><p>
I saw the President of the Provisional Assembly of 
Holland and represented to him the circumstances, assuring 
him I was persuaded an erroneous construction had been 
given to the clause in the law, and that it was not intended 
to operate in a manner inconsistent with the stipulations 
contained in the treaty. 
</p><p>
He said there was certainly no such intention. That there 
was meant to be left a discretionary power with the municipalities to authorize strangers travelling through the country 
to carry with them whatever money they had brought into it. That if, however, the scruples of the municipality at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> should continue, it would still perhaps not be necessary for me to apply to the States General on the 
occasion, as the law would in all probability very soon be repealed. It was only a temporary regulation which had 
already answered as far as could be expected the purposes for which it was made, and was therefore no longer necessary. 
</p><p>
Two American vessels arrived in the course of the winter at 
the Texel have hitherto been prevented by the ice from proceeding to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. At present the French commandants in the ports where they are, will not permit them to 
finish their voyage without passports from the representatives of the French people. Upon my mentioning this fact the 
President said it must be owing to some mistake. He said he would speak to the French representative, Alquicr, the 
only one still remaining here, and requested me to do the 
same, if I thought proper, in order to remove this inconvenience at present and anything of the same kind in future. 
</p><p>
I requested of the Representative Alquicr, first verbally, and afterwards in writing, an order to the commandants at 
the places where the two vessels are detained to permit them to depart and complete their voyage to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, and 
also proposed to him to give a general order to all the French commandants in the ports of the Republic, by virtue of 
which the captains of vessels belonging to citizens of the 
United States may in future, upon presenting to the commandants their sea letters or passports prescribed in the 
treaty of commerce subsisting between the States General and the United States, enjoy the liberty of commerce and the navigation stipulated in that treaty. 
</p><p>
He said that as to the two vessels in particular, there could not be the smallest objection to the expedition of the 
passports, but that under the circumstances of the present moment an indispensable necessity dictated measures to 
prevent the departure of any vessels bound to foreign ports. " We are yet in this country" (said he) "as conquerors, or at 
least we occupy it, and we are obliged to employ some extraordinary means of precaution which we have concerted with the government here." 
</p><p>
I told him that the United States being sincere and cordial friends to both the French and Dutch nations, I 
could assure him my fellow citizens would not be inclined to raise reclamations against the measures of prudence or pre 
caution, which are commanded by the necessities of an extraordinary occasion, even if their operation should involve 
some temporary inconvenience to us. But at the same time I hoped and believed our friends would not extend these in 
conveniences any further than absolute necessity should require, and that every possible facility would be afforded 
to a commerce so beneficial to the interests of all parties. 
</p><p>
He said that in the course of a short time, perhaps a few days, an entire liberty of navigation would be restored, and in 
the mean time, if any captains of American vessels were desirous of sailing and would inform me of their wishes, it 
might facilitate their departure. That no unnecessary restrictions would be imposed, and every possible facility be given. 
</p><p>
The principle upon which the French have proceeded 
since their conquest of these provinces is, that they came as 
the friends of the people and the enemies of the government. One of its deductions is, that although they leave 
private property untouched that of the government be comes the property of the conquerors, as well as that 
of the other governments with whom they are at war which they find here. And as part of this property consists 
in vessels laying in the several ports of the Republic, they think it necessary to allow none to depart without first 
ascertaining whether it is not, upon the system which they have adopted, an object of seizure. 
</p><p>
March 24. A general arrangement is at length agreed to by the Representative Alquier, in consequence of which 
our navigation and commerce in this country will not, I presume, meet with any further obstructions. I inclose 
herewith a copy of my correspondence with him on this subject, and of his order to the commandants. 
</p><p>
Although this correspondence does not come within the 
article of my instructions which prescribes to me the exclusive 
use of our own language, I am not without my apprehensions 
that, in using any other language upon any occasion when I 
write in my official capacity, I may be really departing in 
some measure from the system upon which that direction 
was given me. Your instructions in this instance command 
me not to lose a particular right, and so far I shall certainly 
follow them. If it is the intention of the President that I 
shall never vary from the exercise of the right, I shall scrupulously observe the order from the moment it shall be notified to me. 
</p><p>
If it be an established maxim of the Government of the United States that all the correspondence of their servants 
shall invariably be carried on in their own language, it shall never be varied from by me after I shall once be informed 
of the fact. As this inference may be drawn, though it is not indispensable from that clause of my instructions, I have 
thought myself authorized on these occasions to use the French, as an accommodation to the persons to whom I 
wrote, and have therefore always written to the French representatives here in that language. 
</p><p>
I have had occasion repeatedly to make application to them upon occurrences so inconsiderable as not to deserve a 
particular notification of them to you, and in which nothing more than some particular convenience of an individual 
fellow-citizen was to be obtained. They have always required a demand in writing, but upon every occasion I have 
found them ready to give every facility that has been required of them in behalf of citizens of the United States, 
and their assurances of good will and fraternity, which never fail of being repeated with the utmost apparent cordiality, have hitherto been as invariably attended by the 
substantial proofs of their sincerity in the compliance with everything demanded of them. 
</p><p>
I have the honor, &C. 
</p><p>
