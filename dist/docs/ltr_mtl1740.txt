MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : Your letter of last Wednesday is received, and I cannot refrain from 
expressing my surprise that before now K. and B. did not go out in search of names, and have 
sent forth all those circulars. Their conduct is becoming mysterious. We have heard enough 
of their talk it is time now they should be acting. Their delay, I fear, has ruined the business. 
The circulars should all have been out before the election. I cannot understand their slowness. 
As Mr. Greeley's home is in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, he could certainly have been found had he ~been sought ; 
and there are plenty of other good men in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, as well as himself. I venture to say, that 
before the election not a circular will be sent out. I begin to think they are making a political business of my clothes, and not for my benefit either. 
Their delay in acting is becoming very suspicious. Their slow, bad management is ruining every 
prospect of success. I fear you are only losing your time in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and that I shall be left 
in debt for what I am owing the firm. I have 
written to K. and B., and they do nothing that I request. I want neither <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=frd" rel="met friend">Mr. Douglass</a> nor Garnet to lecture in my behalf. The conduct in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> is disgusting me with the whole business. I cannot understand what they have been 
about. Their delay has only given the enemies time to gather strength ; what tloes it all mean ? 
Of course give the lady at 609 permission to sell the dresses cheaper. * * I am feeling 
wretchedly over the slowness and do-nothing style of B. & K. I believe in my heart I am 
being used as a tool for party purposes ; and they do not design sending out a circular. * * *

Your friend,
