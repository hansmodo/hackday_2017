The old craft has been flying through the water, dashing the spray from her bows at a terrible rate. Last evening, it being feared the waves would dash into the stern windows, they were closed and as a consequence it became almost suffocating in the cabin. It was very evident no sleeping could be done there, and several removed their beds on deck. I took mine and lay on deck until midnight when a rain squall came up and I had to move my quarters, but without finding a place that I could sleep in. Hence I had to keep watch until morning.

The wind has now strengthened to a gale, and we are moving, or rather jumping, along under very little canvas, with the sea so rough that it reminds us of Cape Horn. The rolling and rocking of the vessel for the last two days has been terrible, bringing back slight sea-sickness to several of us. We hope the wind and sea will abate and enable us to spread more canvas.

Yesterday a common hawk flew around the vessel for some time and then perched on the rigging. After admiring it awhile, it was concluded that we must have a shot at him, and accordingly the piece was loaded and fired, but without taking effect. The piece was, however, loaded and fired again and it brought the
poor fellow to a watery grave. It is supposed he was blown from shore in a gale and lost his reckoning.

This forenoon a vessel was discovered to windward, apparently bearing for us. When she came near we raised our colors, expecting that she would raise hers, but for some time she raised no flag at all, and at length she flew the English colors. When near us, we halted to enable her to come up, but she manoeuvred about in such a manner, one moment steering towards us and the next some other course, that we put off at full speed and she soon after crossed our wake in a southeastern course.

We had a potpie with one chicken in it for dinner.
