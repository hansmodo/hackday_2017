<p><i>[Biographer's note:
Another noble English gentleman, who had shown great kindness to the
South and who was a warm admirer of General Lee, was the Honorable
A. W. Beresford Hope.  He, I think, was at the head of a number of
English gentlemen who presented the superb statue of Stonewall
Jackson by Foley to the State of Virginia.  It now stands in the Capitol
Square at Richmond, and is a treasure of which the whole Commonwealth
may justly be proud.  Through Mr. Hope, my father received a handsome
copy of the Bible, and, in acknowledgement of Mr. Hope's letter, he
wrote the following:]</i>

                              Lexington, Virginia, April 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1866">1866</a>.
</p><p>
Honourable A. W. Beresford Hope, Bedgebury Park, Kent, England
</p><p>
Sir:  I have received within a few days your letter of November 14,
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>, and had hoped that by this time it would have been followed by
the copy of the Holy Scriptures to which you refer, that I might have
known the generous donors, whose names, you state, are inscribed on
its pages.  Its failure to reach me will, I fear, deprive me of that
pleasure, and I must ask the favour of you to thank them most heartily
for their kindness in providing me with a book in comparison with
which all others in my eyes are of minor importance, and which in all
my perplexities has never failed to give me light and strength.
Your assurance of the esteem in which I am held by a large portion
of the British nation, as well as by those for whom you speak, is
most grateful to my feelings, though I am aware that I am indebted to
their generous natures, and not to my own merit, for their good opinion.
I beg, sir, that you will accept my sincere thanks for the kind
sentiments which you have expressed toward me, and my unfeigned
admiration of your exalted character.  I am, with great respect,
</p><p>
             Your most obedient servant,
</p><p>
                        <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>.
