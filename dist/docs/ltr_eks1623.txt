CASTLE OF PEROTE, 
April 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
I wrote you a few hastily penned pages from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> 
in which I briefly noted our march from Tlacatalpin 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>, and from that place to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>. The 
entire route is full of interest, many points being the 
scenes of severe contests of Hernando Cortes, and 
besides the historical interest connected with every 
foot of the road, the scenery on every side is of the 
grandest character. The great national road from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> to Mexico, which is an admirably constructed pavement, the work of the old Spaniards, 
winds up and down the sides of the huge hills now 
abruptly ascending, now pitching into some deep 
valley, where it crosses the ravine or dashing stream 
by a stone bridge whose beautiful construction puts 
to shame anything of the kind in the United States. 
</p><p>
The entire distance after the traveler passes <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> 
is bordered with the luxuriant growth of tropical 
climes from the stately palm to the most diminutive 
cactus. The gorgeous flowers of this region are now 
in full bloom, and surpass anything in the vegetable 
kingdom of which I had before conceived. On the 
twenty-sixth, at two in the afternoon, our regiment 
marched out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> over the road of which I have 
been speaking. For about two miles it descended be 
tween beautiful pastures enclosed with good stone 
fences, and occasionally a corn or barley field all look 
ing precisely like New England and lacking only its 
thriving population. The climate of this region cannot be surpassed, the soil is exceedingly rich and all 
the fruits in the world grow in it. If I could have my 
friends around me and a good government I should 
delight to pass my life in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>. We halted at a little 
stream in the valley near a cotton factory, at the base 
of a rugged hill with an unwriteable Indian name, 
where Cortes fought one of his hardest battles. As 
soon as our train was in position we began the ascent 
of the eastern slope of the mountain, the road winding 
along its side and rising rapidly towards its summit. 
The afternoon was delightful, the air clear and bracing 
as on a November day in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a>; the setting sun 
shone brilliantly on the snowy peak of Orizaba whose 
high crest was constantly in our view. At dark we 
reached the village of San Miguel. In this mountain 
region the air was cold, a damp, chilly fog closed around 
us making it necessary to quarter the men in some of 
the buildings, while the officers took possession of the 
house of the curate who had fled his charge under the 
universal panic following the defeat of Cerro Gordo. 
This village most beautifully located in a kind of semisphere on the side of the mountain, with fine water, 
a glorious climate, and a productive soil, is a most 
miserable, filthy place. 
</p><p>
April 27. In the morning before sunrise we con 
tinued our ascent, the road winding round the edge 
of the wide semisphere in which the village lay. As 
we arrived at the top the sun unobscured by a cloud 
rose above the horizon, apparently far below us, his 
first rays lighting the peak of Orizaba and showing 
us far in the distance the shining spires and domes of 
the beautiful city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>. The clouds in many- 
colored, gorgeous piles were resting on the summit of 
the mountains while the soft mists were lying in the 
lap of the hills below, the cultivated valleys showing 
all their beauties between, while here and there a 
bold precipice or ragged peak gave sublimity to the 
scene which was " beautiful exceedingly." I was in 
the advance with the vanguard, being officer of the 
day, and halted to gaze upon the view. I know not 
whether I am more susceptible to the effects of fine 
scenery than others but this which was by far the 
most glorious picture of nature I have ever beheld 
completely overcame me, and I dropped on the earth 
to breathe a prayer and a thanksgiving to a good God 
who had made such a glorious world. 
</p><p>
As we advanced ascending during the day the tropical plants and trees were fast disappearing from the 
road, being replaced by those of a more rigorous 
climate. Apples and peach trees were almost the 
only fruit-bearing ones we saw, now in full blossom, 
and the pine almost the only forest tree. About ten 
o clock I was startled by the sight of a new Troy-built stagecoach which, drawn by six mules, driven 
by a Yankee and filled with Yankee passengers, was 
dashing down the mountain road at the speed of ten 
miles an hour. I looked at it and the apple trees by 
my side and could almost imagine I was ascending 
some hill in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a>. 
</p><p>
About noon we reached the pass of La Hoya, a wild 
ravine overlooked by the fortified peaks of the hills 
around it and passing directly through the extinct 
crater of an ancient volcano. This position is as strong 
as Cerro Gordo and preparations had been made to 
defend it, but the enemy abandoned it and their 
cannon, under the panic which seems to have seized 
the entire nation after the battle of the eighteenth. 
This is the highest point in the road between the coast 
and the City of Mexico, about nine thousand feet 
above the sea. We were glad to commence the descent. 
Before night we halted at a small stream, Agua Frio, 
having marched thirteen miles. On our left towered 
the lofty peak, Coffre del Perote, in our front could 
be seen the snowy summit of Popocatepetl and the 
silver crest of Orizaba was also still visible. A stone 
bridge spanned the small stream near us, and just 
above it was a distillery in full operation. 
</p><p>
Our bivouac was made around the ruins of an old 
palace. It was a massive, square construction nearly 
one hundred feet on a side. A colonnade with heavy 
arches and pillars ran the entire extent of the front. 
Passing through the only gate, I entered a square court 
about fifty feet on a side, surrounded by Doric columns 
which once supported the roof of the porches into 
which the extensive rooms of the building opened. 
The inhabitants know nothing of its history and it 
has evidently been abandoned for centuries. Every 
particle of woodwork is decayed, the roofs entirely 
gone, and the earth has gradually risen, nearly cover 
ing the bases of the pillars and burying the marble 
pavements many feet below. It was a moated work, 
the remains of the ditch being evident on two sides, 
serving now for fences to the adjoining fields. Trees 
are growing from some of the rooms, showing the extreme antiquity of the building. It was probably 
erected by some of the Spanish nobles who came to 
this country soon after the conquest by Cortes. Here 
knights have armed for the battle and celebrated their 
victories on their return. Here blushing beauty has 
listened to the amorous tale breathed in her ear by 
her warrior lover. Where are they all now ? The 
beauties have mouldered in the tomb forgotten. The 
very memory of the knights is gone. In the weirds of 
an old poet: 
</p><p>
" Their bones are dust, 
Their swords are rust, 
Their souls are with their God we trust."

April 28. The sun was far above the horizon be 
fore we marched, as we had but nine miles to make 
to Perote. We soon came upon the extensive plain 
upon which stands the celebrated castle. The plain 
which extends for many miles is eight or nine miles in 
width with a light but productive soil. The castle of 
Perote is nearly in its centre, perhaps nearer the west 
ern extremity, and about one mile to the south of it 
is the village, overhung by the Coffre del Perote. I 
rode into the town before going to the castle, which is 
garrisoned by the Sixth and Eighth Infantry, saw 
General Worth, and Major Kirby, from whom I received my desk upon which I am now writing. The 
village is a fourth-rate Mexican town but the castle is 
a chef-d ceuvre. A square, bastioned work, every 
portion of it complete and of the most massive construction, capable of containing many thousand men 
and of enduring a long siege but notwithstanding 
its strength, the Mexicans fled from it without attempting its defence. We have no work to compare with 
it in the United States. It was completed in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
The advance of General Worth's division is some 
twenty miles from here, and we shall soon move on 
Puebla. Since the battle of Cerro Gordo, the Mexican 
Congress have passed a law making it treason for any 
one to propose peace, in fact, declaring perpetual war. 
Rejou and Gomez Farrias have been endeavoring to 
get up a peace party and have been denounced as 
traitors by the Mexican papers. They are very in 
fluential and known to be patriots. I have therefore 
some hopes that they may succeed and that we are 
near the end of the war. If they do not, I see no result but an armed occupation, colonization, and years 
of guerilla warfare. . . .
