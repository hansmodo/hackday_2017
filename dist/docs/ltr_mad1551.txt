DEAR SIR, I am just honored with your favor of the 5th 
instant. The intelligence from General Knox* is gloomy indeed, but it is less so than the colours in which I had it through 
another channel. If the lessons which it inculcates should not 
work the proper impressions on the American public, it will be 
a proof that our case is desperate.

Judging from the present temper and apparent views of our 
Assembly, I have some ground for leaning to the side of hope. 
The vote against paper money has been followed by two others 
of great importance. By one of them, petitions for applying a 
scale of depreciation to the military certificates was unanimously 
rejected. By the other, the expediency of complying with the 
Recommendation from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a> in favour of a general revision 
of the federal system was unanimously agreed to. A Bill for 
the purpose is now depending, and in a form which attests the 
most federal spirit. As no opposition has been yet made, and 
it is ready for the third reading, I expect it will soon be before 
the public. It has been thought advisable to give this subject 
a very solemn dress, and all the weight that could be derived 
from a single State. This idea will be pursued in the selection 
of characters to represent Virginia in the federal Convention. 
You will infer our earnestness on this point from the liberty 
which will be used of placing your name at the head of them. 
How far this liberty may correspond with the ideas by which 
you ought to be governed will be best decided when it must 
ultimately be decided. In every event, it will assist powerfully 
in marking the zeal of our Legislature, and its opinion of the 
magnitude of the occasion.

Mr. Randolph has been elected successor to Mr. Henry. He 
had 77 votes, Col. Bland 26, and R. H. Lee 22. The delegation to Congress drops Col. H. Lee, a circumstance which gives 
much pain to those who attend to the mortification in which it 
involves a man of sensibility. I am yet to learn the ground of 
the extensive disapprobation which has shewn itself. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, most respectfully and affectionately your's.
