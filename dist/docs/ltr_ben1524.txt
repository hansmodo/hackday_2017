My dear Child
</p><p>
I wrote to you yesterday per Post. This is only to acquaint you, that I am determined against going in the first Pacquet.
</p><p>
Send me the Indian Sealskin Hussiff, with all the Things that were in it. It will be an acceptable Present to a Gimcrack great Man in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=London" rel="city">London</a>, that is my Friend. In the right hand little Drawer under my Dest, is some of the Indian Lady’s Gut Cambrick; roll it up as you would a Ribband; wrap it in Paper, and put it into the Housiff with the other Things.
</p><p>
Among my Books on the Shelves, there are two or three little Pieces on the Game of Chess; One in French bound in Leather, 8vo. One in a blue Paper Cover, English; two others in Manuscript; one of them thin in brown Paper Cover, the other in loose Leaves not bound. If you can find them yourself, send them: But do not set anybody else to look for them. You may know the French one, by the Word echecs in the Titlepage.
</p><p>
I wrote you fully about the Accounts Books; so add only my Love to all Friends, from Your affectionate Husband
