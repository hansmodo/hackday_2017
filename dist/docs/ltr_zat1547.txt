My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your esteemed & welcome letter of the I st was duly rec d & I again 
must say I sincerely hope that something will yet occur to bring this war 
to a speedy & favorable termination, & I can but look on the last acct s 
from Vera Cruz as rather favorable to such expectation, as it is pretty 
certain that Parades 1 was in the City of Mexico on the i6 th ult & could 
not quit there for fear a revolution taking place should he do so ; I 
consider it therefore doubtful if a Mexican army should meet us at or 
near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> he will hardly be at the head of it 
</p><p>
It is only natural I should take the deepest interest in John s wellfare, as well as in that of all your children, & truly hope they may all be 
prosperous & happy. The boys I trust whether in the public service or 
in private life will act well their parts what ever may be assigned them ; 
& in such a way not only to sustain themselves by their own merit & 
exertions, but to deserve the esteem of those with whom they may be 
associated ; I will state to Col Taylor your wishes as regards Judge 
McLean as well as to present him your regards It seems to me that 
nothing more as regards your seperation from your family has occurred 
but what you ought to have expected in time of war, & therefore should 
not complain or consider it a hardship ; if others have been exempted 
thus far from such privations they have been fortunate, at the same time 
I would not envy them, as in all probability their time will come; & 
that before a great while. The greatest difficulty to be encountered in 
all this business is the proper location of families if this could be done, 
& they were easy in their circumstances other difficulties might be gotten 
over without those who are seperated for a few years being entitled to 
any great commiseration The greatest difficulty with regard to Ann is 
to know where it would be best for her to locate, the education of the 
children to be considered, as you have means sufficient to make her comfortable, which is not the case with a great many others. If she should 
come to Cincinnati or New Port, the greatest difficulty she will, I apprehend have to encounter will be breaking up disposing of or removing 
her little furniture, & hiring a house suited to the comfortable accommodation of herself & family in addition to getting what was necessary to 
commence with ; the removing from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> to either of the above places 
would be matter of but little moment, as it would be all the way by 
water, & of course would be attended with but little trouble or fatigue. 
But under all the circumstances of the case it seems to me that it would 
be most advisable for her to remain in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> until you can join her, & 
attend in person to the removeal of her & the family to some more desirable position, & see them well established. If they go to Cincinnati or 
N. Port it might be advis for them to board until you could join them, 
when you could determine if it was best to do otherwise &act accordingly.

D r Foot 1 will be with Gen Wool who I presume is now at San 
Antonio & of course will be the head of his Medical staff; the charge 
of the Gen Hospital is as independent position as you can be placed in, 
considering the organization of the corps here as regards rank. The 
arrangement of sending Dr Wells to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> was that of the Medical 
director where I considered the supplies ought to be sent, or the greater 
portion of them, I therefore made no objection to the same. There is 
no intention that I am aware of to make you purveyor. 
</p><p>
It will be desirable as soon as it can be done, to have a medical 
officer stationed permanently at Brazos Island. I consider an ass 1 necessary at Fort Polk, & one must be employed, if no army surg n is dis 
posable I am aware that great abuses exist in your dep t & that several 
of the individuals referred to by you ought to be here ; but as we cannot 
correct said abuses, the best plan is to say but little about them. The 
letter you say you inclosed me from Cap 1 Graham 1 remarking " What 
does it mean " was not rec d you failed to inclose it, as you intended, or 
you on reflection declined sending it Majr Gardner had better remain 
quiet, all cannot be gratified. Rogers I much fear is throwing himself 
away, he will very soon unless he desists altogether from drink, not only 
destroy his property if he has any, but will end his mortal career, & the 
sooner the better. 
</p><p>
As to who is retained in service as Majr Gen much depends on how 
& when this war is brought to a close. I think any administration will 
find it difficult to get clear of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>. And must again remark that 
I hope the Gen will be selected as the Whig candidate for the next 
presidential term ; so far as I am concerned I wish to have nothing to 
do with that high office ; & even if I had this is not a proper time to 
discuss the subject ; let this war at any rate be first brought to a close ; I 
shall under no circumstances commit myself as regards the policy of this 
or that party to gratify politicians. 
</p><p>
The papers are contrary to my expectations, the English I mean, 
are highly complimentary as regards the battles of the 8th  & 9th of May, 
for which the editors are entitled to the thanks of our little Army. I 
am pleased to learn that Dr W. is satisfied with the arrangement of send 
ing him to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Comargo" rel="city">Comargo</a>, present my regards to him. 
</p><p>
Rileys com d will be too large for one medical officer, & I hardly 
suppose that Murray can be taken from it ; you must look to hiring. It 
was very well to sent Witherspoon to the field. 
</p><p>
As an accession of carpanters have been engaged by the Q r Master 
at Fort Polk, I hope ample accommodations for the sick will very soon 
be in readiness at that place for a large number as well as any other 
accommodations for their benefit & comfort. 
</p><p>
I very much regret to hear of Hardees sickness, & as he was 
mending when you wrote hope he will very soon be able to keep in the 
saddle. Governor Henderson is very much better, being able to ride 
about a little, but is still very weak. It was absolutely necessary for 
Dick to return, as I did not believe he could have recovered in this 
climate ; I would have been much pleased could he have remained with 
or near me to the end of the campaign. I have seen L c Raines but 
have not learned the nature of the business which brought him here. 
</p><p>
I agree with you that the breaking up the 2 d Infr will be the cause 
of great distress as regards several families, who must be left quite destitute ; but this is unavoidable, & is the fate of war, & the beauties and 
comforts of a married life in the army ; your family is very differently 
situated being perfectly independent as regards all the necessaries of life 
& most of the luxuries ; for which you ought to be thankful as well as 
reconciled to the situation in which you are placed. 
</p><p>
I was pleased to find you had made the acquaintance of Col Davis
who I presume fully understood the views of the president in relation to 
Mexican affairs & I hope negotiations will be opened before a great 
while for bringing about a peace between the two countries ; at the same 
time I apprehend our gov t will require vast amt of territo to indemnify 
us on acct of the expenditures of the war, as well as for spoliations for real 
& pretended roberies committed on our commerce ; which will no doubt 
be double & treble awarded to certain claimants over & above what they 
ever lost by the commissioners who will be appointed for that purpose. 
</p><p>
Shriver has been ordered to Washington & not to join his com 
pany ; he has been or is to be relieved by Prentis it is understood he 
and Wool did not agree very well. 
</p><p>
I think congress has been long enough in session, & I will be gratified to learn they have adjourned ; I apprehend there is no danger of 
W. being superseded by Butler who I understand is to join me with 
Majr Gen Patterson.
</p><p>
Whenever the war terminates I must remain in the West. I did 
not suppose Thompson would have desired to have returned to the 
Army after leaving as he did. I am glad you turned over the ten dollars to Cummings. I am constantly interrupted while writing & hardly 
know what I have written.
