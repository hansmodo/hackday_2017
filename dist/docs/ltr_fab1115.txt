We have built a new store, one of the handsomest in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento City</a>: twenty feet wide by fifty eight long, two stories with an elegant front and balcony. The upper part will make a fine residence.

Lindley has taken up a farm on the Yuba. He sent for his wife and Captain Cole went up with her last week. So I am all alone. Just got through supper. Confounded hot work this cooking. A real bore, isn't it? If you don't send out that servant girl I'll get married and have somebody to keep house.

The great excitement here now is the grand soiree to come off tomorrow night at the opening of the new theatre. White vests have gone up and kids are in great demand. One of the committee told me that they had issued invitations to one hundred ladies. So you see the
sex are not so few and far between here as you might suppose. I have no doubt by fall they will glut the market, as is the case with lumber. The theatre is a very handsome one with parquet and boxes and larger than the Olympic at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>. 'Mary Taylor' is engaged and will soon be here to play. Why, we had three concerts last week from 'Hertz.' I can't keep up with this country. It goes ahead of me.

The Panama arrived Monday and I have been reading the speech of D. Webster. We have papers to March 15th. I should think there was quite an excitement in Congress but it's no use for the South to try to crowd slavery into this country. There are too many Northern people here for this ever to become a slaveholding state. Liberty in its largest sense reigns here.

The summer or dry season has fairly commenced. The river is still very high. Everything is in full bloom. The prairie is covered with flowers. It has been decided to levee the city and the mayor has issued his proclamation to raise $250,000 to do it with. So we need not fear another flood. Trade is good already although the roads are not good yet. But everything looks promising for a busy season.

Tell Mother I shall look out for Sewall. We do not want him in the store now as we can attend to it ourselves but I will put him in the way of doing something.
