SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed I have the honor to transmit you an ac 
count of necessaries sent off in nine wagons, for the 
Virginia regiments in Continental service. The goods have been delivered to Colonel Finnic, the Quarter 
master, and he has put them under the escort of 
Lieutenant Mennis and a party of soldiers, who, I 
trust, will deliver them safely. It is my wish that 
the troops of Virginia shall have them. I also send a list of some other articles, chiefly linens, that will 
shortly set out from our public store, for the same 
uses. 
</p><p>
Added to this supply, fifteen thousand pounds 
worth of woollens, &c., proper for the soldiers, will 
set out from Petersburg in a few days. These last 
are procured under an act of Assembly, empowering 
me to seize necessaries for our troops wherever they 
may be found. I have given orders, in consequence. 
to proper persons in different parts of the State, which 
I expect will produce many necessaries, if not enough 
for the Virginia troops". Orders are sent to both Carolinas for blankets, particularly, and soldiers clothes ; 
and nothing, possible for me to effect, will be left undone, in getting whatever the troops are in want of. 
</p><p>
I should be more particular, as to the goods seized, 
but the Commissioners have as yet sent me no distinct account of their proceedings. If it happens that 
the wants of your army are supplied in any short 
time, I beg to know it, that the execution of the 
present law for seizing goods may be stopped. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty to send, under cover to your Excellency, two letters from France, to the Marquis de la Fayette. One of them is from his lady, I believe. 
I beg to be presented to him in the most acceptable 
manner. I greatly revere his person and amiable 
character. 
</p><p>
The lenity of your publications respecting deserters 
is very apparent. But, nevertheless, a great many of 
them are yet skulking on the Eastern Shore, and 
really I think their case peculiar. Their officers took 
up the general opinion, that their service would be 
confined to that shore, and promised them to remain there. Their desertion followed upon orders to march 
away. I beg leave to observe, that, if your Excellency would offer them a pardon upon their enlistment to serve this State, it would forward the general service by enabling us to spare so many more 
troops for the Grand Army. I beg leave to assure 
you of the highest esteem and regard, with which I 
have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
