Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 23d ult. expressing a 
desire that Botta's History and your Translation of it may 
have my approbation ; and also that I would mention to 
you the most authentic of the documents which are before 
the public, relative to the negotiations at Paris in <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 
</p><p>
Having, as yet, received and read only the first volume 
of the History, I cannot form, and consequently cannot express, an opinion of the whole work. 
</p><p>
As to the first volume, there are in it certain assertions, 
representations, and suggestions, of which there are some 
which I believe to be erroneous, and others which I suspect 
to be inaccurate. Being too feeble either to write or to 
re id much at a time without fatigue, I forbear to enumerate 
them. I will nevertheless, for your satisfaction, select and 
notice one of the most important, viz. That anterior to the 
revolution, there existed in the colonies a desire of independence. 
</p><p>
The following extracts respect this topic : viz. 
Page 10. — "The love of the sovereign and their ancient 
countrv, which the first colonists might have retained in 
their new establishments, gradually diminished in the hearts 
of their descendants." 
</p><p>
Page 11. — •• The greater part of the colonists had heard 
nothing of Great Britain, excepting that it was a distant 
kingdom, from which their ancestors had been barbarously 
expelled." 
</p><p>
Pane 12. — "As the means of restraint became almost 
illusory in the hands of the government, there must 1, 
arisen and gradually increased in the minds of the Am 
cans, the hope, and with it the desire, to shake off the yoke 
of English superiority." " The colonists supported impatiently the superiority of the British government." 
</p><p>
Page 15. — "Such was the state of the English colonies in America; such the opinions and dispositions of those 
who inhabited them, about the middle of the eighteenth century" " It was impossible that they should have remained 
ignorant of what they were capable; and that the pisive development of national pride should not have rendered the British yoke intolerable." 
</p><p>
Pace 33. — " Alreadv those who were the most zealous 
for liberty, or the most ambitious, had formed, in the secret 
of their hearts, the resolution to shake off the yoke of 1 
land, whenever a favourable occasion should present. This 
design was encouraged by the recent cession of Canada." 
</p><p>
Page 199. — "The colonists looked upon it (the Congress 
of <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>) as a convention of men who, in some mode or 
other, were to deliver their country from the perils that 
menaced it. The greater part believed that their ability, 
&c. would enable them to obtain from the government a 
removal of the evils that oppressed them, and the re-establishment of the ancient order of things. Some others 
cherished the belief that they would find means to conduct 
the American nation to that independence which was the 
first and most ardent of their aspirations ; or rather the 
sole object of that intense passion which stung and tormented them night and day." 
</p><p>
Page 314. — "Both (Putnam and Ward) had declared 
themselves too openly in favour of independence. The 
Congress desired indeed to procure it, but withal in a propitious ti i.e." 
</p><p>
Page 388. — " Thus censed, as we have related, the royal 
authority in the different provinces. It was replaced progressively by that of the people ; that is, by Congresses or 
Conventions extraordinary, that were formed in each 
colony. But this was deemed insufficient by those who 
directed the affairs of America; their real object being 
independence" &c. 
</p><p>
Explicit professions and assurances of allegiance and 
loyalty to the sovereign (especially since the accession of 
King William), and of affection for the mother country, 
abound in lire journals of the colonial Legislatures, and of 
the Congresses and Conventions, from early periods to the 
second petition of Congress in <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>. 
</p><p>
If these professions and assurances were sincere, they 
afford evidence more than sufficient to invalidate the charge 
of our desiring and aiming at independence. 
</p><p>
If, on the other hand, these professions and assurances 
were factitious and deceptive, they present to the world an 
unprecedented instance of long continued, concurrent, and 
detestable duplicity in the colonies. Our country does not 
deserve this odious and disgusting imputation. During the 
course of my life, and until after the second petition of 
Congress in <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, I never did hear any American of any 
class, or of any description, express a wish for the independence of the colonies. 
</p><p>
Few Americans had more, or better means and opportunities of becoming acquainted with the sentiments anddispositions of the colonists, relative to public affairs, than 
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>. In a letter to his son, dated the 22d March, <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, he relates a conversation which he had with Lord Chatham in the preceding month of August. His lordship 
having mentioned an opinion prevailing in England, that 
America aimed at setting up for herself as an independent state, the Dr. thus expressed himself: "I assured him. 
that having more than once travelled almost from i 
end of the continent to the other, and kept a great variety 
of company, eating, drinking, and conversing with them 
freely, I never had heard in any conversation from any 
person, drunk or sober, the least expression of a wish for a 
separation, or a hint that such a thing would be advantageous to America." 
</p><p>
It does not appear to me necessary to enlarge further on 
this subject. It has always been and still is my opinion 
and belief, that our country was prompted and impelled to 
independence by necessity, and not by choice. They who 
know how we were then circumstanced, know from 
whence that necessity resulted. 
</p><p>
It would, indeed, be extraordinary, if a foreigner, remote (like Mr. Botta) from the best sources of authentic 
information, should, in writing such a history, commit no 
mistakes. That gentleman doubtless believed his narrations to be true, but it is not improbable that he sometimes selected his materials with too little apprehension 
of error, and that some of his informers were too little 
scrupulous. This remark derives a degree of weight from 
the following passage in the History, viz. <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a> "left a wife, the object of all his tenderness, with 
several children, still infants, a spectacle tor their country, 
at once of pity and admiration. The state, from gratitude 
towards their father, distinguished them with every mark 
of kindness and protection.*' 1 have been acquainted with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a>'s widow from my youth. The fact 
is, that she never had a child. 
</p><p>
In making the translation, attention has doubtless been 
paid to the rule, that a translator should convey into his 
translation, with perspicuity and precision, the ideas of his 
author, and no others, and express them, not literally, but 
in well-adapted classical language. How far your translation is exactly correct, I am an incompetent judge ; for not 
understanding the language of the original, I cannot examine and compare the translation with it. Of the style 
and manner of the translation, I think well. 
</p><p>
Which are the most authentic documents before the public, relative to the negotiations at Paris in <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>, is a question which I am not in capacity to answer. Many years 
have elapsed since I have read any of them, and others 
have since been published which I have not seen. Without 
a previous and careful examination of each of them, it 
would be rash and unfair to give a preference to either. 
</p><p>
On receiving your first letter, I conjectured that you 
was of the respectable family of your name in Massachusetts ; and that conjecture appears from your last to 
have been well founded. If, in going from- <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, you should not find it inconvenient to take the road 
through this town, you will meet with a welcome reception from 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
