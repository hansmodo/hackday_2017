Dear Benson, 
</p><p>
There seems to be a spell in the pens of my friends in 
New- York. Except Livingston, I have not had a line from 
either of them since I left America ; not even from either 
of my brothers, nor from you, who also are several letters 
in my debt. I have a favour to ask of you ; it is that you 
would make a visit to my father, and send me a minute 
account of his health, and that of the family. Make a half 
dozen copies of your letter, and send them either, to some 
friend at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, or to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Robert Morris</a>, at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
to be forwarded in different vessels. Don't neglect to do 
me this friendly office. You can easily conceive how painful it is to be so long in ignorance and suspense, about the 
situation and welfare of persons so nenr and dear to me, as 
many of thosn are to whom I allude. Tell me also how 
your mother and brothers do ; and believe me to be, as I 
have long been, your 
</p><p>
Affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
