Sunday Oct 13, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> - <br><br> Read your letter of the 15th Sept. Sat. Nearly a month on the may. Suppose you 
are still near the battle line - if you have not already been called into action. 
Well my dear we are keeping up all possible courage and still hoping for the best 
but if you do have to strike, strike hard in the name of a decent civilization 
and a Christian world. There will not be anymore hay allowed to grow in the orchard. 
It is too hard on the trees. Everything has made such a lovely growth. The yard 
east of the house is just a swamp of flowers. Howard and Helen came down with 
camera and took some pictures which you will get in the course of time. <br><br> I am always your loving mother, <br> Sarah King <br>
 We have 22 new rabbits.
