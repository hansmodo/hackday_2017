DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I sent you some time since, Priestly's History of Electricity, 
under the Care of Mr. Molini, Bookseller on the Quay des 
Augustins. I hope it got safe to Paris, and that you have 
receiv'd it. I wish the Reading of it may renew your Taste 
for that Branch of Philosophy, which is already so greatly 
indebted to you, as being the first of Mankind, that had the 
Courage to attempt drawing Lightning from the Clouds to 
be subjected to your Experiments.
</p><p>
In our Return home, We were detained a Week at Calais, 
by contrary Winds, and stormy Weather, which was the more 
mortifying to me, when I reflected that I might have enjoy'd 
Paris and my Friends there all that Time, and yet have been 
as soon at London. 
</p><p>
As I became in Arrear with my Business by so long an 
Absence, I have been necessarily much occupied since my 
Return, and have therefore postponed from time to time 
(and so long that I am now ashamed of it) the Purpose I had 
of writing soon to you, to express the Sense I have of your 
Kindness to me when a Stranger at Paris, and of the many 
Civilities I received from you there and from Mrs. Dalibard, 
which I assure you have made a lasting Impression on my 
Memory. I beg you will both of you accept my sincerest 
Thanks and Acknowledgments. The Time I spent in Paris, 
and in the improving Conversation and agreable Society of 
so many learned and ingenious Men, seems now to me like 
a pleasing Dream, from which I was sorry to be awaked by 
finding myself again at London. 
</p><p>
With the greatest Esteem and best Wishes for your 
Health and Happiness, I have the Honour to be, 
Dear Sir, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
