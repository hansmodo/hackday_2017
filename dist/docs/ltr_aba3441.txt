MY DEAR MRS. SMITH, 
</p><p>
I have not written to you since I received yours of 
January 5th. I go from home but very little, yet I 
do not find my time hang heavy upon my hands. 
You know that I have no aversion to join in the 
cheerful circle, or mix in the world, when opportunity offers. I think it tends to rub off those austerities, which age is apt to contract, and reminds us, 
as Goldsmith says, " that we once were young." 
Whilst our presence is easy to youth, it will tend to 
guide and direct them. 
</p><p>
" Be to their faults a little blind, 
Be to their virtues ever kind, 
And fix the padlock on the mind." 
</p><p>
To-morrow our theatre is to open. Every precaution has been taken to prevent such unpleasant 
scenes as you represent are introduced upon yours. 
I hope the managers will be enabled to govern the 
mobility, or the whole design of the entertainment 
will be thwarted. 
</p><p>
Since I wrote you last, a renewal of the horrid 
tragedies has been acted in France, and the Queen 
is no more. 
</p><p>
' Set is her star of life ; the pouring storm 
Turns its black delude from that achino- head ; 
</p><p>
The fiends of murder quit that bloodless form, 
And the last animating hope is fled. 
" Blest is the hour of peace, though cursed the hand 
Which snaps the thread of life's disastrous loom ; 
Thrice blest the great, invincible command, 
That deals the solace of the slumbering tomb." 
</p><p>
Not content with loading her with ignominy, whilst 
living, they blacken her memory by ascribing to 
her the vilest crimes. Would to Heaven that the 
destroying angel might put up his sword, and say, 
" It is enough ; " that he would bid hatred, madness, and murder cease. 
</p><p>
" Peace o'er the world her olive branch extend, 
And white-robed Innocence from Heaven descend." 
</p><p>
I wish, most ardently, that every arm extended 
against that unhappy country might be withdrawn, 
and they left to themselves, to form whatever constitution they choose ; and whether it is republican or 
monarchical is not of any consequence to us, provided it is a regular government of some form or 
other, which may secure the faith of treaties, and 
due subordination to the laws, whilst so many governments are tottering to the foundations. Even in 
one of the freest and happiest in the world, restless 
spirits will aim at disturbing it. They cry "A lion! 
a lion ! " when no real dangers exist, but from their 
own halloo, which in time may raise other ferocious 
beasts of prey. 
</p><p>
I hope to hear from you soon. I wrote to you by 
Dr. Appleton. Your grandmother has been very 
sick, and is still in so poor a way that I have very 
little expectation of her ever going abroad again, 
She is cheerful and pleasant, and loves to hear from 
her children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She has ever been a woman of exemplary 
benevolence, a friendly, open, candid mind, with a 
naturally good understanding, and zealouslv anxious 
for the welfare and prosperity of her family, which 
she has always promoted by every exertion in her 
power. Her only anxiety seems to be, lest she should 
live to be a burden to her friends ; but this will not 
be her hard lot. Your mother, 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
