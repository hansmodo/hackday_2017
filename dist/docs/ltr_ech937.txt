My Own Dearest Ellen:--Your highly prized letter of January 13th reached me last evening in fifty-one days after it was written, having made the quickest passage of any I have received since residing in the mining district. I have been very fortunate in receiving letters, but many have not. If the friends of many could only know what sadness their neglect creates, they would surely write often.
</p><p>
It affords me extreme pleasure to dwell on the many kind expressions of encouragement, love and hope. You must have been in a very pleasant mood when it was written for it has a happy effect on me.

Last night, while in the fairy land of dreams, I thought that I had come near West Chester, but how I got there I knew not, and the first person I met and recognized was your own dear self. After an embrace
and a kiss, we took a stroll and rambled through many fairy fields and meadows bedecked all over with beautiful flowers. We then reached a meandering rivulet, where we stopped a moment to refresh ourselves with a drink of its cooling waters, then we passed on over many gentle hills and through a beautiful grove of ancient and lofty pines and sycamores. Here we stopped and loitered, first to view this and then to admire that. The weather was warm and sultry, and at length we found ourselves winding our way through a beautiful garden planted with most beautiful and sweet-scented flowers and shrubbery. Here was a beautiful arbor, the sun entirely excluded by the thick foliage of vines and shrubbery. No one was present. A little way off we heard the sweet and soothing notes of a band of music. Being weary, here we seated ourselves and rested and talked till the shades of evening set in, as only two lovers can talk. Time flew on wings of lightning, and I was conducting you down Gay Street, near your father's, whispering sweet words, when I was suddenly interrupted, and awaking, found myself snugly wrapt up in blankets, upon the floor. Such was my dream and a happy one it was, too, except the termination.

As you suggest, I must give the country a fair trial. I can do this by staying here another year and yet return within the three year period first laid down for my absence. You perhaps think I am deferring my return longer than I should, but you know it is necessity and not choice. Besides we are both young and I hope we may be better prepared than now for domestic peace and tranquillity and the varied duties of husband and wife. Of one thing I am certain, at least. I shall be better prepared to settle down permanently than I ever have been heretofore. At home there is little chance for
a mechanic without capital to rise very fast. I must therefore, if possible, make something to begin with before I return.
</p><p>
I am still at work at my business and hope to sell out in time to be home at New Year's. Dr. Gunn's family have arrived in this place. They came by way of Cape Horn, and were out a long while. I now have more comfortable quarters.
</p><p>
You remark that Mrs. Dixon is flirting around, apparently not regarding the death of her husband much. Such a sentence strikes deeply into the heart of every adventurer here in California. It excites his suspicions. Every one has left friends, in a far happier land than this, whom he loved and respected and was loved and respected by them in return. Many have left that comfortable land to endure all kinds of hardships here, for the very purpose of bettering the condition of those at home, to return and bless them with the fruits of their labors here. And then to learn that those wives, sweethearts, relatives and friends have forgotten them, proved recreant and false to them, is too bad. It is enough to set many crazy. I know that some of my friends could never use me so.
</p><p>
You say you have had a ring made out of the dust I sent you together with some other which you added. I am sorry I did not send you enough to complete it. Your letters, your likeness and your ring are the most precious treasures I possess. I never see them without thinking of her who gave them.
</p><p>
It is growing late and so, dear Ellen, good night, and may happy dreams and sweet slumber bless your soft pillow.
</p><p>
Your affectionate
</p><p>
