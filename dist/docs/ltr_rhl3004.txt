DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am informed that a certain Mr. Eustace, now in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, but some time ago with Lord Dunmore, 
is acquainted with a practice that prevailed, of taking 
letters out of the post-office in Virginia, and carrying 
them to Dunmore for his perusal, and then returning 
them to the office again. As it is of the greatest 
consequence that this nefarious practice be stopped 
immediately, I shall be exceedingly obliged to you, 
Sir, for getting Mr. Eustace to give, in writing, all 
that he knows about this business, and inclose the 
same to me at <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>. I wish to know, particularly, what post-offices the letters were taken 
from, by whom, and who carried them to Lord Dunmore. 
</p><p>
This day I set off for Virginia, where, if I can be of any service to yon, it will oblige to command me. It is more than probable that Congress will order our 
friend Gates to Canada. His great abilities and Virtue will be absolutely necessary to restore things 
there, and his recommendations will always be readily 
complied with. You will find that great powers are 
given to the commander in that distant department. 
The system for Canada, adopted since the arrival of 
the Commissioners here, will, I hope, be of essential 
service to our affairs. 
</p><p>
All good men pray most heartily for your health, 
happiness, and success, and none more than, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
