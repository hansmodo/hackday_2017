DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>Governor Clinton</a> will present you my letter to him of this 
date, which contains my unalterable sentiments of the measures 
which ought to be taken, should Sir Harry Clinton attempt to 
succour or reenforce Sir William Howe. I will not again repeat 
them here, but only take the liberty earnestly to recommend the 
profoundest secrecy in whatever you determine to do ; for, depend 
upon it, that that consummate, artful woman, Mrs. Robinson, will 
do all in her power to be acquainted with your secrets.

As to any attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I utterly disapprove of it; 
for, while the enemy's ships of war can act in the North and 
East Rivers, the taking of that city would be doubtful, and, if 
I have had as yet no information of the event of Colonel Johnson's 
attack on the Mount. My loss of men, in these several actions, is 
not more than three or four killed, and five wounded. The enemy's 
loss is less. I find myself in possession of two hundred and ninety-three prisoners, namely; two Captains, nine subalterns, two Commissaries; non-commissioned officers and privates, one hundred and forty-three British, and one hundred and nineteen Canadians; eighteen artificers ; and retook more than one hundred of our men ; total, two 
hundred and ninety-three, exclusive of the prisoners retaken. The 
Avater- craft I have taken is one hundred and fifty bateaux, above 
the Falls ; in Lake Champlain, fifty, above the Falls, including several large gun-boats and an armed sloop ; arms equal to the number of 
prisoners ; some ammunition ; and many other things which I cannot 
as yet ascertain. I must not forget to mention a few cannon, which 
may be of great service to us." 
taken, could not be held ; and be assured, that all stores, of any 
value to us, are or will be afloat, before any large detachments 
leave that city, and I can see no good in taking an empty town, 
which we cannot hold. Of course it is not an object to divert 
the attention of the King's Generals from their more important 
designs.

I am, &c.,
