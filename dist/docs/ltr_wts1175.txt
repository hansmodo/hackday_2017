Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I got back all safe and well the day before yesterday, 
having met no trouble whatever, notwithstanding the 
many rumors of Indian troubles. These are all mysterious, and only accountable on the supposition that our 
people out West are resolved on trouble for the sake of 
the profit resulting from military occupation. I kept 
the same ambulances, and made the very route I had 
prescribed to myself by Garland, Lyon, etc., to Ellsworth, Riley, etc. The railroad is finished to Riley, so 
that I came all the way thence in cars. . . . 
</p><p>
I see rumors of my being called to "<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. Of 
this I know nothing, and if offered I shall decline. I 
must keep clear of politics in all its phases, for I must 
serve any administration that arises. I am not aware 
that I have ever on paper expressed any opinion of this 
seeming conflict between Congress and the President. I 
deplore it as much as you do, and still hope that some 
solution will be found. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
