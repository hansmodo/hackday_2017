DEAR Sm ******* 
Your ideas on the proposed discrimination between foreign 
Nations coincide, I perceive, exactly with those which have 
governed me. The Senate did not allow that no effort should 
be made for vindicating our commercial interests, but argued 
that a more effectual mode should be substituted. A committee 
was appointed in that branch to report such a mode. The report made is founded on something like a retort of her restrictions in the West India channels. It is now said that as the 
measure would involve an imposition of extraordinary duties, 
the Senate cannot proceed in it. Mr. Gerry, alluding to these 
circumstances, moved two days ago for a bill giving further 
encouragement to trade and navigation, and obtained a committee for the purpose. What will be the result is uncertain. 
If the attempt, added to what has passed, should, as it probably 
will, be made known abroad, it may lead to apprehensions that 
may be salutary.

The attention of the House of Representatives for some days 
has been confined to the subject of compensations. The bill is 
at length brought into its final shape. Much discussion took 
place on the quantum for the members of Congress, and the 
question whether it should be the same for both Houses. My 
own opinion was in favor of a difference, founded on a reduction 
of the sum proposed with regard to the House of Representatives, and an augmentation as to the Senate. As no difference 
took place, the case of the Senate, and of the members from S. 
Carolina and Georgia, had real weight against a lesserv.um 
than 6 dollars, which I own is higher than I had contemplated 
for the House of Representatives, and which I fear may excite 
criticisms not to be desired at the present moment.

Yesterday was spent on a Message from the President relative to Indian affairs, and the Militia Bills are ordered, providing for a Treaty with the hostile Tribes, and for regulating 
the Militia. The latter is an arduous task, and will probably 
not be compleated at this Session.
