DEAR SIR, - 9 ********** 
I think, with you, that it would have an odd appearance for 
two Conventions to be sitting at the same time with powers in 
part concurrent. The reasons you give seem also to be valid 
against augmenting the powers of that which is to meet at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>. I am not surprized, therefore, at the embarrassment 
of Congress in the present conjuncture. Will it not be best, on 
the whole, to suspend measures for a more thorough cure of our 
federal system till the partial experiment shall have been made ? 
If the spirit of the Conventioners should be friendly to the 
Union, and their proceedings well conducted, their return into 
the councils of their respective States will greatly facilitate any 
subsequent measures which may be set on foot by Congress, or 
by any of the States.

Great changes have taken place in the late elections. I regret much that we are not to have your aid. It will be greatly 
needed, I am sure. Mercer, it seems, lost his election by the 
same number of votes as left you out. He was absent at the 
time, or he would no doubt have been elected. Have you seen 
his pamphlet? You will have heard of the election of Col. 
Mason, General Nelson, Mann Page, G. Nicholas, Jn Nicholas, 
and Col. Bland. Col. Mason will be an inestimable acquisition on most of the great points. On the port bill he is to be 
equally dreaded. In fact, I consider that measure as lost almost 
at any rate. There was a majority against it last session if it 
had been skilfully made use of. To force the trade to Norfolk 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a>, without preparations for it at those places, 
will be considered as injurious. And so little ground is there 
for confidence in the stability of the Legislature, that no preparations will ever be made in consequence of a preceding law. 
The transition must of necessity, therefore, be at any time abrupt and inconvenient. I am somewhat apprehensive, likewise, 
that Col. Mason may not be fully cured of his anti-federal prejudices.

We hear from Kentucky that the savages continue to disquiet 
them. Col. W. Christian, it is - said, lately lost his life in pursuing a few who had made an inroad on the settlement. We 
are told, too, that the proposed separation is grgwing very unpopular among them.
