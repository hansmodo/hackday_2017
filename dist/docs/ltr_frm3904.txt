SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours of the llth ultimo is before me. If you suffer Moore and Broderick to remain, they must give bail for their good behavior; each 
to give two good sureties, bound in five hundred guineas each, and to do six months duty in the militia; the bond to be executed before 
a Justice of the Peace. Mr. Lesesne must certainly pay his rent; but it is a matter I have nothing to do with ; as it is a civil affair between citizen and citizen, there is a way pointed out by law. He 
never had any promises from me of a billet, which ought not to be 
done but on the greatest necessity, as it is a grievance to the people, 
which at all times ought to be avoided when it can. If it can be 
proved that Solomon Miller has cheated or defrauded the public, he 
should suffer agreeably to law, which is, to have a hearing before a 
Justice of the Peace, and, if found guilty, must go to jail, or give security to appear at the next sessions. Capt. Gough told me he had 
leave of absence for a month. As the Governor and <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> have 
come into the plan of dismounting your corps "to act as infantry under 
you, if it is agreeable to you; if not, to remain as they are, without 
the liberty of impressing any horses for them, for their time of service 
is so short, it is not worth going to that expense, neither will they let 
Maham impress any more horses, and without more horses, &c., &c., 
the few you have cannot be of any service. I will make the proper 
arrangement, but will not do it without you signify your approbation, 
which I will wait for. The four barrels indigo, in the hands of Paul 
Trapier, Esq., you will take for public uses, and may procure clothing 
for our troops, and rum, sugar, &c. I wish the flag could sail, that 
Capt. Howell and crew may be dismissed. In my last I mentioned the 
British being up in St. Thomas , but believe it is premature, as my 
party of observation, who are down towards Cain hoy, have given me 
no account of it. For want of forage and subsistence, I shall remove 
to-day above Murray's Ferry, in St. Stephens ; indeed, I shall be 
obliged to move often, to prevent the enemy forming any plan against 
me. I am very sensible the trouble you must have in your command 
in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, but your well known abilities and zeal for your country 
will surmount everything. 
</p><p>
I am, with esteem, your obedient servant,
