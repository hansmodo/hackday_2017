CAMP NEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>, 
April 28, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a>. 
</p><p>
Since my last letter we have had busy and exciting 
times. I have already mentioned that on the nine 
teenth Lieutenant T. Porter with one private of the 
Fourth Infantry were killed. On the twenty-fifth 
Colonel Cross s remains were buried at the foot of 
our flagstaff. His son intends removing his body to 
Washington. On the twenty-fourth information had 
been received from our spies that the enemy were 
crossing the river some miles below us fifteen hundred 
strong, and also twenty-eight miles above with a 
force of twenty-five hundred. 
</p><p>
A squadron of Dragoons was sent down the river to 
ascertain the truth of the report in that direction, but 
returned next day finding no enemy. At the same time 
two troops under command of Captain Thornton were 
sent up the river. They were composed of Captains 
Thornton and Hardee, Lieutenants Mason and Kane, 
with fifty-two enlisted men, well mounted, well 
equipped, as gallant a little band as ever struck a 
blow. On the morning of the twenty-sixth their 
guide, a Mexican, returned and stated that he had 
left them twenty miles above having learned that the 
enemy were in force near them. Shortly after he 
parted from them, he heard many volleys of musketry, 
and abandoning his horse he secreted himself in the 
chaparral where he remained concealed all day. Two 
mounted Mexicans passed his position, examining 
the houses and the shrubbery, evidently in search of 
him. He kept quiet until night when he came to 
camp as fast as possible to make his report. His con 
clusion was, that the whole party were killed to a man. 
Everyone at first discredited him entirely, but as hours 
rolled by and none of the band appeared his sad tale 
gained credence. At one in the afternoon, as we were 
going to the trenches to work, the whole army work 
ing by six-hour reliefs, we met a Mexican cart bring 
ing in a wounded Dragoon, sent by the Mexican 
General Torrejou from motives of humanity, with a 
note to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> stating that he had no flying 
hospital, and confirming in part the report of the 
guide, but rendering it a little less horrible by stating 
that all were not killed, some of them having been 
captured, who, he said, would receive the treatment 
due to prisoners of war. 
</p><p>
In the course of the afternoon a parley was sounded 
from the other side, and a boat crossed bringing over 
another wounded Dragoon and an official report from 
Captain Hardee. He states in substance that in 
obedience to orders Captain Thornton proceeded up 
the river fifteen miles on the night of the twenty-fourth, and started again at the dawn of the next day. 
The guide being convinced that the Mexicans were 
near, in force, refused to go any farther, in which he 
was justifiable, as his life would be the certain forfeit 
if he were taken. Captain Thornton was, however, 
unconvinced of the presence of a foe, and determined 
to proceed. In a short time they came to a large farm 
with some houses at the upper end, the whole surrounded by a dense chaparral hedge. They rode into 
this field, single file, by a pair of bars which were about 
two hundred yards from the houses, Captain Thornton 
in advance, and Captain Hardee in the rear. The men 
immediately scattered among the houses, many dismounting seeking some one to question. No guard 
was left at the entrance. While in this situation the 
alarm was given the Mexicans were upon them. An 
order to retreat was promptly given, but too late. 
On reaching the pass, it was found closed and covered 
by a heavy body of infantry. They were nearly surrounded, the Mexicans firing upon them from three 
directions, the river side alone being open. They, 
however, remained undaunted and rode down by the 
fence to the right. At this time Captain Hardee said 
to Captain Thornton, " Our only chance is to tear down 
the fence and cut our way to the rear." Thornton 
assented, but his horse, a noble, powerful roan, became 
ungovernable and ran off with him, followed by many 
of the men. The last that was seen of Thornton, his 
horse by a desperate and extraordinary leap was clearing the fence. Captain Hardee immediately rallied 
the residue of the troops and pushed for the river, in 
tending to swim it and go down on the other side. 
This was found impracticable, the bank being extremely boggy. Hardee then counted his men - 
twenty-five besides Lieutenant Kane and himself, 
some of whom were wounded, and all having lost 
either a sabre, a pistol, or a carbine and formed 
them in order of battle, all resolutely determined to 
sell their lives as dearly as possible if they could not 
obtain honorable terms. Hardee advanced by himself 
and was met by a Mexican officer, with whom favor 
able terms were arranged, and they at once laid down 
their arms. When all the prisoners were collected 
they numbered forty-five, six of whom were wounded. 
Seven of our men were killed, and Captain Thorn 
ton and Lieutenant Mason were missing, presumed 
dead. 
</p><p>
The prisoners were all marched to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> and 
paraded in triumph. The conditions of the surrender 
were complied with, the officers receiving half-pay 
and civil treatment and the men radons or twenty- 
five cents per day. This morning another message 
was received from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> with letters from 
Thornton, alive after all, in which he stated that he 
was finally taken, by his horse falling and rendering 
him insensible. The Mexican, Colonel Torrejou, who 
is a native of Pensacola, says Thornton most gallantly 
cut his way through their infantry and cavalry and 
went off apparently unhurt though closely pursued, 
and that he was within five or six miles of our camp 
when his roan leaped or fell over a precipice leaving 
Thornton insensible, in which situation he was taken 
prisoner. Our men, of course, are not allowed to 
make any definite statements concerning the Mexican 
force or losses, their communications being open and 
passing through the hands of the commanding officer. 
Thus far our little parties have been most unfortunate. 
We hope, however, in a few days in a pitched battle 
to satisfy these gentlemen that it is necessary for them 
to keep to their own side of the river, and even then 
we shall not let them remain long unmolested. We 
are only waiting to finish the fort, so as to secure our 
position, when we shall be at them let their numbers be what they may. For many days we have had 
constant information that their forces were increasing 
by large accessions from the interior, while ours have 
been decreasing by numerous discharges and from 
other causes. Unless they felt they were strong they 
would not dare be in our rear, as it is to be believed 
they are. At all events, our communication is almost 
if not entirely cut off with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a>, to which place 
we must and will fight our way.
