<p></p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
<p></p>
You have an excellent memory to remind me, after 
so long an interval, of my promise to visit you when 
next on a tour to the South, and I owe you an apology 
for not earlier acknowledging your kind letter. It was 
handed to me just as I was about to leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, 
and I have been since too constantly in motion (to Augusta, and back here) to allow me to write. 
<p></p>
As to the " speculations " at Columbia relative to 
"the object of my visit to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a> at this moment", 
I can only say, that I am on that very tour, and about 
the very time, mentioned by me when I last had the 
pleasure of seeing you. On what evils days we have 
fallen, my good friend, when so commonplace an event 
gives rise to conjecture or speculation! I can truly 
assure you, that no one has felt more wretched than 
your humble correspondent, since an unhappy controversy began to assume a serious aspect. I have always 
entertained a high admiration for the history and character of South Carolina, and accident or good fortune, 
has thrown me into intimacy, and even friendship, with 
almost every leader of the two parties which now divide 
and agitate the State. Would to God they were again 
united, as during the late war, when the federalists vied 
with the republicans in the career of patriotism and 
glory, and when her legislature came powerfully to the 
aid of the Union. Well, the majority among you have 
taken a stand, and those days of general harmony may 
never return. What an awful position for South Carolina, as well as for the other States! 
<p></p>
I cannot follow out the long, dark shades of the picture that presents itself to my fears. I will hope, nevertheless, for the best. But I turn my eyes back, and, 
good God ! what do I behold ? Impatient South Carolina could not wait she has taken a leap, and is already a foreign nation ; and the great names of Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, and Greene, no longer 
compatriot with yours, or those of Laurens, Moultrie, 
Pinckney, and Marion with mine. 
<p></p>
But the evil, supposing the separation to have been 
peaceable, would not stop there. "When one member 
shall withdraw, the whole arch of the Union will tumble in. Out of the broken fragments new combinations 
will arise. We should probably have, instead of one, 
three confederacies a Northern, Southern, and Western reunion ; and transmontane Virginia, your native 
country, not belonging to the South, but torn off by 
the general West. I turn with horror from the picture 
I have only sketched. I have said it is dark ; let but 
one drop of blood be spilt upon the canvas, and it becomes "one red". 
<p></p>
"Lands intersected by a narrow frith 
Abhor each other. Mountains interposed 
Make enemies of nations, which had else, 
<p>
Like kindred drops, been mingled into one." 
<p></p>
But you and my other South Carolina friends have taken your respective sides, and I must follow out mine. 
<p></p>
You have probably heard of the arrival of two or 
three companies at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, in the last six weeks, 
and you may hear that as many more have followed. 
There is nothing inconsistent with the President s message in these movements. The intention simply is, 
that the forts in the harbor shall not be wrested from 
the United States. I believe it is not apprehended 
that the State authorities contemplate any attack, at 
least in the present condition of things, on these posts ; 
but I know it has been feared that some unauthorized 
multitude, under sudden excitement, might attempt to 
seize them. The President, I presume, will stand on 
the defensive thinking it better to discourage than to 
invite an attack better to prevent than to repel one, 
in order to gain time for wisdom and moderation to 
exert themselves in the capitol at Washington, and in 
the state house at Columbia. From humane consider 
ations like these, the posts in question have been, and 
probably will be, slightly reenforced. I state what I 
partly know, and what I partly conjecture, in order 
that the case which I see is provided for in one of your 
bills, may not be supposed to have actually occurred. 
<p></p>
If I were possessed of an important secret of the 
Government, my honor certainly would not allow me to 
disclose it ; but there is in the foregoing neither secrecy 
nor deception. My ruling wish is, that neither party 
take a rash step, that might put all healing powers at 
defiance. It is, doubtless, merely intended to hold the 
posts for the present. A few companies are incapable 
of effecting any further object. The engineer, also, is 
going on, steadily, but slowly, in erecting the new work 
(Fort Sumter, near the site of Fort Johnson, long since 
projected for the defence of the harbor), the foundation 
of which is but just laid. When finished, some years 
hence, I trust it may long be regarded, both by South 
Carolina and the other States, as one of the bulwarks 
of our common coast. 
<p></p>
There is nothing in this letter intended to be confidential, nor intended for the public press. "When I 
commenced it, I only designed giving utterance to private sentiments, unconnected with public events; but 
my heart being filled with grief en account of the latter, my pen has run a little into that distress. Let us, 
however, hope for more cheering times. Yet, be this 
as it may, and whether our duties be several or common, I shall always have a place in my bosom for the 
private affections ; and that I may ever stand in the old 
relation to you, is the sincere wish of your friend, 
<p></p>
