Sir, 
</p><p>
Although I have had near two days to reflect on 
the purport of the letter received from the Secretary 
of the Treasury, on the 1st instant, I confess I am 
not yet relieved from the agitation of mind produced 
by that communication. 
</p><p>
My grief for the necessity of pointing the bayonet 
against the breasts of our countrymen, is equalled only 
by my conviction of the wisdom of jouv decision to 
compel immediate submission to the authority of the 
laws, and by my own apprehensions of my inadequacy to the trust you have been pleased to honor 
me with. I never expected to see so strange a crisis; 
much less to be called to the command of an army, 
on the judicious direction of which may perhaps depend our national existence. But being ready to 
give my aid on the awful occasion, I was willing to 
take any part in the measures you might think proper to order for cj[uelling the insurrection, without regard to rank or station. 
</p><p>
The honor yon have fixed to my name, Iby the late 
signal testimony of your approbation and confidence, 
impresses me with every feeling which the most affectionate gratitude can inspire. I will bestow, invariably, the whole power of my mind and body, to give 
the most propitious effect to your wishes. If success 
attends my endeavours, I shall be happy indeed. If 
the reverse happens, I shall be truly miserable to the 
last hour of my life ; because I shall attribute the 
public misfortunes which must ensue to my own incapacity, however strenuous and faithful may have 
been my efforts. 
</p><p>
With these feelings, you will readily anticipate the 
keen solicitude I must momently experience to prepare myself for the fulfilment of the duties expected 
from me. I cannot so certainly or so easily do this, 
as with you. If, then, the appeal expected be inevitable (which I pray Heaven may still avert), let me 
entreat you to call me to you at once. A thousand 
things will occur relative to the army and its objects, 
which I ought to understand in time ; and I ought 
also to make myself acquainted with the temper of 
the insurgents, the characters and views of their 
leaders, and with the country in which the troops 
are to act. With most affectionate attachment and 
entire respect, I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
