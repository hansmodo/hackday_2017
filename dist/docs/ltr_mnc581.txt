My dear Miss Annie
</p><p>
It is long since any communication has passed between us tho I have heard of you & enquired for you I was so gratified at your thinking of me & sending me such a charming note which I am reading with deep interest It presents such a lively picture of those exciting times & often remind me of our struggles & privations though we were spared the guillotine, there were many who (Page 2) have used it if they dared I was glad to hear that you were as well as you could hope to be after such a long severe winter tho  in your comfortable city houses you could scarcely realize it except thro what you might hear of the sufferings of the destitute. There was much more here than usual but mostly owing to the idleness & improvidence of the negroes, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mil" rel="child met">Mildred</a> is still suffering with her foot tho her Doctor thinks she make walk in the course of the summer. Give my (Page 3) affectionate love to your mother & tell her I shall keep her two nice caps to wear at the Hot. They fit me nicely & are just the kind I like. Shall we not see you all in the mountains this summer? or will you go to one of the more fashionable resorts - Tell my dear Mary I have not forgotten her but am quite in despair now my hands are so feeble of ever painting that memento for her I cannot tell you how much I lament the loss of our good friend Mr Ficklin. He was frequently recalled to me by some kind & amusing letter. I miss them (Page 4) greatly. What is your brother walking about now that he has given up the paper? You must remember me particularly to him. My children write in regards to you all
