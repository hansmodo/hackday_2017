Dear Brother : The Ohio election is now over, and you 
have a clear working majority in the Legislature. So I 
infer you are safe for another six years in the Senate. 
I hope so, and was told by Mr. Delano, in the cars coming East, a few days since, that you were sure of reelection. 
</p><p>
I understood from one of his revenue officers along, 
that Delano was not even a candidate for the Senate. 
</p><p>
Some time ago Admiral Alden invited me to go out to 
the Mediterranean with him in the Wabash Frigate, to 
sail in November. I have pretty much made up my 
mind to go, and President and Secretary have promptly 
consented. . . . 
</p><p>
I made the condition myself, that, though I shall arrange to be gone five months, I would hold myself prepared to come back within thirty days of notice by 
telegram. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
