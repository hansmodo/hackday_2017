SIR: 
<p></p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a>, several days since, communicated 
in person to you his orders to repair to Mexico, to take 
the command of the forces there assembled, and particularly to organize and set on foot an expedition to 
operate on the Gulf coast, if, on arriving at the theatre 
of action, you shall deem it to be practicable. It is not 
proposed to control your operations by definite and 
positive instructions, but you are left to prosecute them 
as your judgment, under a full view of all the circumstances, shall dictate. The work is before you, and the 
means provided, or to be provided, for accomplishing 
it, are committed to you, in the full confidence that you 
will use them to the best advantage. 
<p></p>
The objects which it is desirable to obtain have 
been indicated, and it is hoped that you will have the 
requisite force to accomplish them. 
<p></p>
Of this you must be the judge, when preparations 
are made, and the time for action arrived. 
Yery respectfully, 
<p></p>
Your obedient servant, 
<p></p>
