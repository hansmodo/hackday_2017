MY DEAR FRIEND, Whilst I thank you for your favor of the 
23d ultimo, I must remind you that it does not contain the 
promised information on the case of the French Consul here. 
I am led to it by being myself just reminded by him of the 
omission on my part. 
</p><p>
The plan of an immediate temporary impost was what first 
occurred on the subject. It is not yet abandoned, but the practicability is questionable. The plan of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1783">1783</a> was inadmissible 
without alteration on some points, which have been most productive of delay. I allude particularly to the ratio between 
the duties on ruin and molasses. When this plan was recommended by Congress, the States could restrain the substitution 
of N. England rum by taxing it, which being now prohibited, 
an indirect tax on it through the medium of molasses is become 
essential on the part of the National authority. The rates of 
impost are in their last stage, and will probably be soon determined. The plan of temporary collection, by a general adoption of the existing regulations of the States, is also before the 
House of Representatives. A uniform plan will in a day or 
two follow it from the Committee appointed to report the 
proper mode. The House will be able to make their election 
between the two. The reasons for despatch will recommend 
the first, if it can be made to hold water, which is much doubted. 
Whichever plan may be preferred, it will be proper, perhaps, 
to limit its duration, that a more correct provision within a 
reasonable time may be rendered a matter of necessity.

No question has been made in this quarter or elsewhere, as 
far as I have learned, whether the General ought to have accepted the trust. On the contrary, opinions have been unanimous and decided that it was essential to' the commencement 
of the Government, and a duty from which no private considerations could absolve him. The promptitude of his setting 
out from Mount Vernon was the effect of information of the 
delay of business here, the impatience of the public mind, and 
the necessity of his presence to make the Government competent to its first and most urgent objects. His election was 
known to him with certainty a long time before the ballots 
were opened, and informally communicated, I believe, before it 
was regularly notified. It was taken for granted here, that, 
under the circumstances of the occasion, he would lose no time 
in repairing to his station, if he meant not to decline it altogether. Col. Griffin has, I presume, sent you his inaugural 
speech. Inclosed is the answer of the House of Representatives. The address is purged, you will observ. of all titles 
whatsoever except the Constitutional one. 
This point had been previously determined by a Report from 
a joint committee originated by the Senate, for the purpose of 
settling what, or whether any, titles should be annexed to the 
President and Vice President. The Report was unanimously 
agreed to by the House of Representatives previous to the 
address. I am sorry to find that the Senate do not concur in 
this principle of dignified simplicity. They have disagreed to 
the Report of the joint Committee, and have proposed another 
consultation on the subject. The House of Representatives 
will assuredly adhere to the first determination. The friends 
of titles in the other Branch are headed by the vice president, 
who is seconded with all the force and urgency of natural 
temper by R. H. L . I make no other remark on the case 
than that it is communicated to yourself only. 
Ever most affec y yours, 
</p><p>
My compliments to the President. I wish to write to him, 
but my friends must excuse me from much of the attention 
which my inclination would give them.
