MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
THIS letter, I presume, will go by the brave and 
amiable <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>. Our army will have 
a group of officers equal to any service. Washington, Ward, Lee, Gates, Gridley, together with all the other New England officers, will make a glorious council of war. 
</p><p>
This Congress are all as deep as the delegates from 
the Massachusetts, and the whole continent as forward as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. We shall have a redress of grievances, or an assumption of all the powers of Government, legislative, executive and judicial, through out the whole Continent, very soon. Georgia is be 
stirring itself. I mean, the whole of it. The Parish of St. John's, which is one third of it, was with us before. 
</p><p>
I am, &c. 
</p>
