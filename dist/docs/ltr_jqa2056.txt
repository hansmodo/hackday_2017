No. 22 [EDMUND RANDOLPH]

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, January 24th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
The municipality, or to speak more accurately the pro 
visional Representatives of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, are presided [over] by 
Mr. Schimmelpenninck, an eminent lawyer, with whom I had 
formed an acquaintance upon my first arrival in this city. 
He is a man of fair reputation for abilities and integrity, 
both parties appear to consider him as worthy of the station in which he is placed. 
</p><p>
I saw him accordingly this morning, and stated to him 
the grounds upon which I wished to obtain as early information as possible upon their future intentions. I observed 
to him that the rumor appeared to indicate a total revolution of government, of Constitution, and of principles to 
commence from the present moment. That in the relation 
in which other nations stand towards this the knowledge 
of their further views becomes a subject of mutual importance, and that I believed it to be customary to give notice 
to other friendly governments of such great changes as that which is taking place. 
</p><p>
He said he believed that the substance of all the institutions whereby the government has hitherto been administered would be provisionally retained ; that by proceeding 
otherwise they could expect nothing but anarchy. That 
they had written letters to all the cities of this province 
requesting their new regencies to appoint deputies to meet 
together at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>; that these deputies were already 
appointed, and he supposed would assemble tomorrow. 
They would assume all the functions hitherto performed by 
the States of Holland. They had also written circular 
letters to all the other provinces requesting them to pursue 
the same system of alteration. That as soon as this could 
be effected an assembly would be formed consisting of deputies from the provincial assemblies, which would be a substitute for the former States General. That officers correspondent to the Pensionary of Holland and Grefficr of the 
States General would be appointed, and in general that the 
mode of government would be preserved as heretofore. 
But that as the titles of "High and Mighty," of "Great and 
Noble," and the like, are not acceptable at the present day, 
these Assemblies would be known under more civic denominations. Perhaps they would be called the " Assembly of 
the United Provinces/ "The Assembly of the Province of 
Holland," or something similar, but the powers would still 
remain. He added, that he had yesterday seen and con 
versed with the representatives of the French people upon 
this subject. That they entirely concurred in the opinion 
that this is the best system that can be pursued for temporary 
arrangement, and had promised to support them in it. 
</p><p>
He assured me that he would not forget the intimation 
relative to the notice to be given to other powers of the 
change of government here, and I requested him also to 
bear in mind that the credentials of ministers to and from 
the late States General may perhaps be so far affected as 
to require renewal or change. . . .
