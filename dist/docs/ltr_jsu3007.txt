MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have called on <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a>, and informed 
him, confidentially, of the state of our army. He says 
there are about six hundred Continental troops here, 
with two Massachusetts militia regiments. He is of 
opinion, that the Continental troops here should be 
sent forward, and that this State should garrison this 
post, for which purpose he will call on <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a>, and 
consult with him upon the most effectual measures to 
bring it about. 
</p><p>
Dear General, since I left the army I have been 
informed that <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> is to take the command at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> the ensuing campaign. Though 
I never wish to complain, I cannot help the disagree 
able feelings, so common to mankind, when they find 
themselves slighted and neglected. When I had completed the disagreeable retreat from Canada, I was 
with circumstances of indignity. Since which, 
and before, every Major-General, except myself, has 
had the honor of commanding posts, separated from 
the main army. <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> has commanded at 
New r York and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>; <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> at Ticonderoga and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>; <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> in the Jerseys, when the army was at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; General 
Spencer at Rhode Island ; and <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a> the 
forces in this State. I have never yet been thought 
worthy to intrust with the command of a separate 
post. I have felt those things most sensibly, and 
wish to know, to what it is owing. If it be to my 
want of prudence, resolution, or whatever other cause, 
I wish to know it, that I may rid the Continent of 
an officer who is unworthy to trust with command. 
</p><p>
I once had the command in Canada by an act of 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> ; and even malice itself cannot censure my 
conduct. I was soon deprived of the command, and 
rewarded with disgrace for saving the army and 
stores in that country. I know that <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> will 
become an important object with the enemy. They 
must try for it, and therefore he that has the command there will have the post of honor. I do there 
fore humbly claim it as my right, and as the first 
separate post intrusted to my care; and cannot think 
of the command being given to a younger officer, 
without conceiving myself a second time treated with 
neglect, which I well know my conduct has not deserved. 
</p><p>
I wish your Excellency to forward me a line by 
the post upon this subject, which will be gratefully 
acknowledged by 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
