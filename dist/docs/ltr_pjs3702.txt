Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your Excellency's order in August 
last, <a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='colleague'>Brigadier-General Clinton</a> left me a guard of one 
sergeant, one corporal, and eleven privates, chiefly 
aged and infirm men. He has lately ordered these 
to he reduced to a corporal's guard. It is now a 
notorious fact, that three parties have been expressly 
sent from Canada to take or put me to death. Captain Brownson, lately returned from Canada, a Mr. Shephard, of Tryon county, a Mr- Mott of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, and others who have made communications to 
the Commissioners for detecting conspiracies, all agree, 
that the British are determined to get me into their 
possession. The imprudence of the Commissioners for 
detecting conspiracies, to whom, in order to save a 
person employed by me, I was under the necessity 
of communicating some secret matters, which have 
been divulged, has rendered the enemy's inveteracy 
still greater ; and I am persuaded that, even with my 
former guard, I shall run some risk both in person 
and property, and that, without such a one, I must 
remove myself and family to a place of greater security. I have, therefore, to entreat your Excellency 
the favor of an order to <a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a>, to recomplete the guard, as he left it in August last.

Yesterday, I received advice that the people on 
the Grants had generally assembled in town meetings, had declared their apprehensions that a criminal 
intercourse prevailed between some of their people 
and the British, and determined on an examination 
of the conduct of the suspected persons; and had, by 
a great majority of the towns, voted that a relinquishment should be made of their late extended 
claim, both on the east and west. The latter part of 
this intelligence is this moment confirmed to me, in 
such a manner that I have not a doubt remaining of 
its truth; and I have reason to believe that the former part is not without foundation. With every wish, 
which affection and esteem can inspire, 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
