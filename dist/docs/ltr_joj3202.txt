DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of 
the 16th instant. Britain refused the mediation of 
Spain at a time when their spirits were elated by 
their successes in the West Indies and the Southern 
States, and by the accounts they received of discord 
in Congress, discontent among the people, and a prospect of the evils with which we were threatened by 
the depreciation of our currency. Deceived by these 
illusory gleams of hope, they permitted their counsels 
to be guided by their pride. What reason they may 
have to expect succour from other powers is, as yet,a secret. M. Gerard is decided, in his opinion, that 
they will obtain none. The conduct of France, inestaishing peace between Russia and the Porte, has 
won the heart of the Empress ; and the influence of 
Versailles, at Constantinople, will probably give duration to her gratitude. The Emperor and Prussia are 
under similar obligations. The latter wishes us well, 
and the finances of the former are too much exhausted to support the expenses of war, without subsidies 
from Britain, who, at present, cannot afford them. 
There is no reason to suspect that the peace of Ger 
many will soon he interrupted. Britain may hire 
some troops there, but it is not probable she will be 
able to do more. Portugal and the Dutch, while directed by their interest, will not rashly raise their 
hands to support a nation, which, like a tower in an 
earthquake, sliding from its base, will crush every 
slender prop that may be raised to prevent its fall.

<a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>'s letter has been referred to the 
Committee of Intelligence for publication. 
</p><p>
You may remember, Sir, to have received a letter 
from me last winter, recommending the person who 
carried it as an honest man, and who, in my opinion, 
would, with great fidelity, do the business you wished, 
and I advised him, to undertake. 
</p><p>
In May last, I received a letter from him, informing; me of his having written to you at the same 
time, and mentioning a matter of very delicate nature, which, I believe,- was omitted in your letter, as 
he gave me reason to expect he would soon be here. 
I avoided particulars, not choosing to risk more on 
paper than was necessary. lie has not, however, been 
here, nor have I received a line from him for some 
time past. From this circumstance, I have been apprehensive of his having relinquished that business ; 
and the more so, as he intimated to me his doubts 
of its being well conducted, unless under your immediate direction; that the views of the gentleman, with 
whom he first conversed on the subject, were not very 
extensive, and his attention to expense too great. 
</p><p>
The opinion I have of this man's usefulness leads 
me to mention these matters, that, if he has left the 
business, I might, if you think proper, press him to 
resume it. If he still perseveres, I do not wish to 
be informed of any other particulars. With perfect 
respect, and sincere regard, I am, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient servant,
