DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, who will have the honour of delivering 
you this letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on a project which I think in the present situation of affairs there, is 
a very good one, and deserves every kind of support and 
encouragement. This is, to raise two, three, or four battalions of negroes, with the assistance of the government of 
that state, by contributions from the owners, in proportion 
to the number they possess. If you should think proper to 
enter upon the subject with him, he will give you a detail of 
his plan. He wishes to have it recommended by congress 
to the state, and as an inducement, that they would engage 
to take their battalions into continental pay. 
</p><p>
It appears to me, that an expedient of this kind in the characterised him, addressed the French government and their ambassador 
here on the subject, urging the advantages which would result to both nations 
from having a French military force in this country. This proposition was 
immediately patronized and enforced by the family and connexions of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague friend met'>Marquis</a>, which were then in power and great influence in France, and adopted by 
that government. I deem it a duty incumbent on me, and a tribute due to his 
memory, that the knowledge of this fact should be recorded as an additional 
evidence of bis pre-eminent services to his country." 
present state of southern affairs, is the most rational that 
can be adopted, and promises very important advantages. 
Indeed, I hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected 
in that quarter without it ; and the enemy's operations 
there are growing infinitely serious and formidable. I have 
not the least doubt that the negroes will make very excellent soldiers, with proper management ; and I w r ill venture 
to pronounce that they cannot be put in better hands than 
those of Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, and 
enterprise, and every other qualification requisite to succeed in such an undertaking. It is a maxim with some 
great military judges, that with sensible officers, soldiers 
can hardly be too stupid ; and on this principle it is thought 
that the Russians would make the best soldiers in the world 
if they were under other officers than their own. The 
King of Prussia is among the number who maintains this 
doctrine, and has a very emphatic saying on the occasion, 
which I do not exactly recollect. I mention this because I 
have frequently heard it objected to the scheme of embodying 
negroes, that they are too stupid to make soldiers. This is 
so far from appearing to me a valid objection, that I think 
their want of cultivation, (for then- natural faculties are probably as good as ours,) joined to that habit of subordination 
which they acquire from a life of servitude, will enable 
them sooner to become soldiers than our white inhabitants. 
Let officers be men of sense and sentiment, and the nearer 
the soldiers approach to machines, perhaps the better. 
</p><p>
I foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt we 
have been taught to entertain for the blacks, makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor experience ; and an unwillingness to part with property of so 
valuable a kind, will furnish a thousand arguments to show 
the impracticability or pernicious tendency of a scheme 
which requires such sacrifices. But it should be considered, that if we do not make use of them in this way, the enemy probably will, and that the best way to counteract the 
temptations they will holdout, will be, to offer them ourselves. 
An essential part of the plan is, to give them their freedom with their swords. This will secure their fidelity, animate 
their courage, and, I believe, will have a good influence upon 
those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation. 
This circumstance, I confess, has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of the project ; for the dictates 
of humanity and true policy equally interest me in favour 
of this unfortunate class of men. 
</p><p>
When I am on the subject of southern affairs, you will 
excuse the liberty I take in saying, that I do not think measures sufficiently vigorous are pursuing for our defence in 
that quarter. Except the few regular troops of South 
Carolina, we seem to be relying wholly on the militia 
of that and the two neighbouring states. These will 
soon grow impatient of service, and leave our affairs in a 
miserable situation. No considerable force can be uniformly kept up by militia ; to say nothing of the many obvious and well-known inconveniences that attend this kind 
of troops. I would beg leave to suggest, sir, that no time 
ought to be lost in making a draft of militia to serve a 
twelve-month, from the states of North and South Carolina and Virginia. But South Carolina, being very weak 
in her population of whites, may be excused from the draft, 
on condition of furnishing the black battalions. The two 
others may furnish about three thousand five hundred men, 
and be exempted, on that account, from sending any succours to this army. The states to the northward of Virginia 
will be fully able to give competent supplies to the army 
here, and it will require all the force and exertions of the 
three states I have mentioned, to withstand the storm 
which has arisen, and is increasing in the south. 
</p><p>
The troops drafted must be thrown into battalions, and 
officered in the best manner we can. The supernumerary officers may be made use of as far as they will go. If 
arms are wanted for their troops, and no better way of 
supplying them is to be found, we should endeavour to levy 
a contribution of arms upon the militia at large. Extraordinary exigencies demand extraordinary means. I fear 
this southern business will become a very grave one. 
With the truest respect and esteem, I am, sir, 
Your most obedient servant,
