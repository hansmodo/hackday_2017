<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, 12th Jan. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1831">1831</a>: 
SIR: A short time before the last adjournment of Congress, a copy of a 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> to Mr. Forsvth, in- relation to the deliberation Of 
the cabinet on the Seminole question, was placed in the hands of General 
Jackson, and became the subject of a correspondence between him and myself. In the course of that correspondence, it became necessary, in order 
to ascertain the truth or error of some of the statements made by Mr. 
Crawford, to refer to some of the other members of the cabinet, and I accordingly addressed notes to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wiw" rel="met colleague">Mr. Wirt</a>, from both of 
whom I obtained statements. In selecting those gentlemen, instead of your 
self and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bwc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crowninshield</a>, I was not in the least degree influenced by any 
want of confidence in either of you, but simply by feelings of delicacy 
growing out of political relations, v and which I trust to corresponding feelings on your part properly to appreciate. 
</p><p>
I learn by a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, addressed to me subsequent to the 
close of my correspondence with Gen. Jackson, that he has written to you, 
and obtained your answer on the subject to which it refers, though he has 
not furnished me with a copy of his letter to you, nor that of your answer. 
</p><p>
This step on his part has, of course, removed the delicacy which I at first 
felt, and which then prevented me from addressing you. 
</p><p>
The part I took in the cabinet deliberation was dictated by a sense of 
duty, uninfluenced by either the feelings of friendship or enmity. That 
Gen. Jackson transcended his orders in taking St. Mark s and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, I 
have never doubted, then or since. In my opinion, the Executive neither 
did or could constitutionally give orders to take either of those places, or 
any other Spanish post. Under this impression, I was decidedly in favor, 
in the early stage of the deliberation, of bringing the subject before a court 
of inquiry, but finally yielded my opinion to considerations growing out of 
the political aspect of the question, as connected with Spain, which were 
presented by you and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a>; but, in yielding to them, I still believed! 
and do now, that, apart from them, and considered under the military aspect 
of the subject, as at first view, my opinion was correct. 
</p><p>
Having thus concurred in the final decision of the cabinet, I gave it a 
faithful support, without however abandoning the correctness of my first 
conceptions. I make this preliminary statement in order that you may perceive why my inquiry should be directed only to what might seem a mere 
collateral circumstance, whether the letter of Gen. Jackson to Mr. Monroe, 
in which allusion is made to John Ray, was before the cabinet, which, 
though not calculated to affect the question of the correctness of my course, 
however decided, from the prominence that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> has given it, has 
assumed no small degree of importance in the correspondence. He, in his 
letter to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a>, says: Indeed my own viewa on the subject had 
undergone a material change after the cabinet had been convened. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> made some allusion to a letter the General had written the President, who had forgotten that he had received such a letter, but said, if he 
had received such an one, he could find it, and went directly to his cabinet, 
and brought the letter out. In it Gen. Jackson approved of the determination of the President to break up Amelia island and Galveztown, and 
gave it also as his opinion, that the Floridas ought to be taken by the United 
States. He added, that it might be a delicate matter for the Executive to 
decide, but, if the President approved of it, he had only to give a hint to 
some confidential member of Congress, say Johnny Ray, and he would do it,
and take the responsibility of it on himself." 
</p><p>
The object of my addressing you is, to obtain a statement from you
whether such a letter was, or was not, before the cabinet during its deliberation. 
</p><p>
As conueetefl with the subject of my inquiry, I must ask of you the favor to furnish me, if you can with propriety, with a copy of Mr. Crawford's letter to you, and a copy of your answer. I make the request on the 
assumption that the correspondence can contain nothing that would render 
it improper that a copy should be placed in my possession. I would make 
the request of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> himself, instead of you, had I not declined 
all communication with him in relation to the subject of the correspondence 
between Gen. Jackson and myself, except through the General, through 
which channel no opportunity to make the request has been afforded me.
