SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letters, of the 20th and 21st instant, are 
received. I thought fit this morning to acquaint Colonel Burrell, appointed to command the regiment 
destined to Canada from hence, that a month's pay 
will be advanced to officers and men by you. This 
additional encouragement will enliven them to the 
service. Also to inform, that I understood the route 
of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire regiments 
would probably be by Number Four to Onion River, 
with a Commissary to attend such as went that way. 
A month's pay was promised the men by my proclamation, and, on being acquainted with the readiness 
of the men, one of the Committee of the Pay-Table 
should attend for the payment thereof at <a href='/results.php?city=litchfield' rel='city'>Litchfield</a>, 
to prevent delay. I am unable to inform how and 
when the money from you may be received. 
</p><p>
The men in that quarter are well spirited and 
zealous, but have yet received no intelligence of the 
progress made in the business. Shall give you every 
necessary intelligence as it comes to my knowledge. 
</p><p>
Every necessary requisite for the march of this regiment will "be provided on the best terms in my 
power. Shall forward the three regiments destined 
for your camp, without delay. I am, with sincere 
esteem and regard, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
