My DEAR SIR : Both your last letters came to hand to-day. I felt for you, on seeing the order in which the balloting placed the delegates in Congress. It is an effect of that rancorous malice, that has so long followed you, through that arduous 
path of duty which you have invariably travelled, since America resolved to resist her oppressors. Is it any pleasure to you, to remark, that at the same 
era in which these men figure against you, public spirit seems to have taken its flight from Virginia ? 
It is too much the case ; for the quota of our troops is not half made up, and no chance seems to remain for completing it. The Assembly voted three 
hundred and fifty horse, and two thousand men, to be forthwith raised, and to join the grand army. Great bounties are offered, but I fear, the only effect will be, to expose our State to contempt, for I 
believe no soldiers will enlist, especially in the infantry. Can you credit it ; no effort was made for supporting, or restoring public credit ! I pressed 
it warmly on some, but in vain. This is the reason we get no soldiers. We shall issue fifty or sixty thousand dollars in cash, to equip the cavalry, and 
their time is to expire at Christmas. I believe they will not be in the field before that time. Let not Congress rely on Virginia for soldiers. I tell you 
my opinion, they will not be got here until a different spirit prevails. I look at the past condition of America, as at a dreadful precipice, from which we 
have escaped, by means of the generous French, to whom I will be everlastingly bound by the most heartfelt gratitude. But I must mistake matters, 
if some of those men who traduce you, do not prefer the offers of Britian. You will have a different game to play now with the commissioners. How 
comes Governor Johnstone there ? I do not see how it comports with his past life. Surely Congress will never recede from our French friends. Salvation to America depends upon our holding fast our 
attachment to them. I shall date our ruin from the moment that it is exchanged for anything Great Britian can say or do. She can never be cordial 
with us. Baffled, defeated, disgraced by her colonies, she will ever meditate revenge. We can find no safety but in her ruin, or at least in her extreme 
humiliation, which has not happened, and cannot happen until she is deluged with blood, or thoroughly purged by a revolution, which shall wipe from existence the present king with his connexions, and 
the present system, with those who aid and abet it. For God's sake, my dear sir, quit not the councils of your country, until you see us forever disjoined 
from Great Britian. The old leaven still works. The flesh pots of Egypt are still savoury to degenerate palates. Again, we are undone if the French alliance is not religiously observed. Excuse my freedom. I know your love to our country, and this is 
my motive. May heaven give you health and prosperity.

I am, yours affectionately,
