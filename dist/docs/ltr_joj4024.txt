My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your very kind letter of the 7th inst., gave me all that pleasure which accompanies marks of cordial esteem and 
attachment from those whose commendation is praise, and whose friendship is discriminate. 
</p><p>
Among the objects of my mission are some which, however just, will not be easily attained, and therefore its success will be precarious, and probably partial. The only 
satisfaction I promise myself from this appointment, will flow from the rectitude with which the duties of it will be 
discharged, and not from a prospect of general approbation. God grant that the time may not be far distant when 
peace and liberty shall lead you from the field, to enjoy, in silence and retirement, the luxury of reflecting that you had saved your country. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
With sincere affection and esteem, 
</p><p>
I am your friend and servant, 
</p><p>
