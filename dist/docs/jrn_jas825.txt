Merritt & Kitt Carson arrived with News of Sonoma beeing occupied by the Americans, and the same evening arrived as prissoners Genl. Vallejo, Don Salvador Vallejo, Lt. Col. Prudon & M. Leese, and given under my charge and Care, I have treated them with kindness and so good as I could, which was reported to Fremont, and he then told me that prissoners ought not to be treated so, then I told him, if it is not right how I treat them, to give them in charge of somebody else.
