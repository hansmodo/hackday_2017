Dear Brother: Your letter of the 20th has vbeen received. I thought, and was glad to hear, that you had 
a charming trip. I saw enough of the mountain region 
to give me a new estimate of its great value. In some 
respects I regret that I did not go with you, but situated 
as I am, it was extremely fortunate that I returned as I 
did. My political position ought not to be misunderstood, but unfriendly critics took occasion of my absence 
in the canvass to attribute it to duplicity or cowardice. 
The President's course on the Civil Eights Bill and 
constitutional amendment was so unwise that I could 
not for a moment allow any one to suppose that I meant 
with him to join a coalition with rebels and Copperheads. 
Besides, Johnson was elected by a party upon professions 
before and after his election and inauguration so pointedly different from his recent course that it appeared to 
me a betrayal of those who trusted his professions, and 
therefore in the highest sense dishonorable. But worse 
than all, his turning out good men sometimes wounded 
soldiers merely because they adhered to their party 
convictions, and putting in men who opposed the war 
throughout, is simply an unmitigated outrage that will 
stain the name of any man connected with such conduct. 
This was the deliberate judgment of nearly every man in 
the Union party, and the feeling was intensified by the 
President's conduct in his recent tour, when he sunk the 
Presidential office to the level of a grog-house.

I do trust you will not connect your name with this 
administration. You lose in every way by it. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> 
ought not to ask it, for in the common judgment it places 
you in equivocal relations with him. You will have all 
the odium caused by disappointment in the reorganization of the Army, and will have a most difficult, delicate, 
and responsible duty to discharge, in which you can gain 
no credit and may lose much. Besides, it connects you 
as a partisan with Johnson just what he wants, but 
what you ought to dread. What can you think of the 
recent telegrams about your private letter? If you 
wrote a private letter, what business had they to make it 
public in the most offensive way by innuendo? <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> 
and you are above the ephemera of party politics, and 
for the sake of the country I hope will keep so. Let 
Johnson take Cowan, or some one that left the Union 
party with him, but my convictions are so strong that 
you ought not to play "Administrator de bonis non" 
of Stanton, that I write thus freely. If you conclude 
otherwise, I can only say I shall deeply regret it. ...

Affectionately,
