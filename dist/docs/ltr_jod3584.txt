MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE weather is cooler, and the minds of men are 
calmed by the enclosed communication ; but a soured 
party will plunge us [in war] if possible. The most un- 
candid, the most hypocritical part is acted, to take us 
in. Protestations against war by those who are pushing every thing that can force war, are not the worst. 
The southern men have art enough to dupe northern 
ones to bring forward measures, that the northern 
part may have the odium of bringing on a war. In 
short, the knavery of some is so abominable, and the 
stupidity of others so contemptible, that I am almost 
brought to Raynal's wish. The old debtors to Britain uniting with those who are bribed to France, and 
both operating upon the populaces of our great towns, 
will devote this country to calamities as unnecessary 
as they will be dismal, unless the vigilance and patience of those who have no object but their country's 
good is supported by the sound part of the people out 
of doors. 
</p><p>
My good and worthy son, I presume, sees all I send 
you. All my hopes are in him, both for my family 
and country. 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>
