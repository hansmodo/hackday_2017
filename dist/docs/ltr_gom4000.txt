Dear Jay, 
</p><p>
Congress have sent me here, in conjunction with some other gentlemen, to regulate their army, and in truth not a 
little regulation hath become necessary. Our quartermaster and commissary departments are in the most lamentable situation. Opportunities have been neglected last 
campaign which were truly golden ones, but omnipotent fatality had, it seems, determined that the American capital 
should fall. Our sentiments on this occasion are so perfectly coincident that I will not enlarge. The mighty Senate 
of America is not what you have known it. The continental currency and Congress have both depreciated, but in 
the hands of the Almighty Architect of empires, the stone which the builders have rejected may easily become head 
of the corner. The free, open, and undisturbed communication with the city of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> debauches the minds 
of those in its vicinage with astonishing rapidity. O, this State is sick even unto the death, and in Sir William they 
have certainly got a most damnable physician. Just before 
the reduction of the forts, the enemy balanced exactly upon 
the point of quitting the city, and a straw w r ould have 
turned in either scale. Our troops ; Heu miseros ! The skeleton of an army presents itself to our eyes in a naked, 
starving condition, out of health, out of spirits. But I have seen Fort George in the summer of <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. Next 
campaign I believe we shall banish these troublesome fellows. For Heaven's sake, my dear friend, exert yourself 
strenuously in the great leading business of taxation. To 
that great wheel "a thousand petty spokes and small annexments are morticed and adjoined." I earnestly entreat you 
and my other friends, fortia opponere pectora to that fatal 
system of limitation, which, if carried into execution, would 
be downright ruin, and in the ineffectual attempt will carry 
us to the brink of it. Yorktown and its neighbourhood
although nearly ninety miles from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, already considers our money almost as waste paper. At taverns, 
take as specimen the following rates : breakfast and supper each, seven shillings and sixpence ; dinner, ten shillings ; 
one night's hay for one horse, seven shillings and sixpence; oats, per quart, one shilling ; toddy, per bowl, ten shillings ; 
rum, per gill, seven shillings and sixpence; wine, per bottle, from thirty to forty shillings, and the like ; you will observe 
this is proclamation. Hay, they tell me, hath been sold in some places at Â£20 proc. per ton. My love to Livingston. 
I shall write to him by this opportunity, if I can find time to send a long letter, which, indeed, I owe him. Remember me to Mrs. Jay, and believe me, yours,
