MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
ON Wednesday I dined with Mr. Russell, the friend 
of Dr. Priestley, and while we were at table, in came 
large packets of letters and newspapers from Eng 
land. The ladies at table had letters from their 
friends, and the scene was so lively, so much like 
what I had often felt, that it put me into very good 
humor. The news was what you will see in Fenno's 
paper. 
</p><p>
Yesterday I dined at the President's, with ministers 
of state and their ladies, foreign and domestic. After dinner the gentlemen drew off after the ladies, 
and left me alone with the President in close conversation. He detained me there till nine o clock, and 
was never more frank and open upon politics. I find 
his opinions and sentiments are more exactly like 
mine than I ever knew before, respecting England, 
France, and our American parties. He gave me intimations enough that his reign would be very short. 
He repeated it three times at least, that this and that 
was of no consequence to him personally, as he had 
but a very little while to stay in his present situation. 
This must be a confidential secret. I have hinted it 
to no one here. The President told me he had that 
day received three or four letters from his new minister in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, one of them as late as the 29th of 
December. <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Pickering</a> informs me that Mr. Ad 
ams modestly declined a presentation at court, but it 
was insisted on by Lord Grenville ; and, accordingly, 
he was presented to the King, and I think, the Queen, 
and made his harangues and received his answers. By 
the papers I rind that Mr. Pinckney appeared at court 
on the 28th of January, after which, I presume, <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a> had nothing to do but return to Holland. The 
appearances of peace are as yet but faint. 
</p><p>
The House of Representatives have applied for 
papers, and the President has their request under 
consideration. He is not at all pleased with this. 
A motion is now before the House, made by Mr. Harper, that it be resolved that provision be made 
to carry into execution all the treaties yet published. How long this will be debated I know not. 
There is danger that the delay on our part will occasion delays on the part of Britain, but I hope not. 
Three of our representatives, Lyman, Dearborn, and Varnum, voted against all New England, except one, 
I believe, in Vermont. The loss of Mr. Ames and 
Mr. Dexter, has been much lamented. Varnum, 
and Lyman, and Dearborn, are as inveterate as Giles, 
by all that I hear. 
</p><p>
I have not yet seen my son's public letters. There 
is such rancor of party that the prospect of a change 
in administration quite cures me of all desire to have 
a share in it. Repose and poverty, I say. Yet I am 
not intimidated. Renegadoes and adventurers from 
foreign countries acquire such an influence among 
the people, although there is no attachment in their 
nature to us or our country, and there is every reason 
to suspect the worst influence over them ; and sensible 
people are so fearful of provoking their wrath and 
impudence by exposing them, that it is really disgusting to enter on any public stage. The people are so 
abused and deceived, and there is so little care or 
pains taken to undeceive and disabuse them, that the 
consequences must be very disagreeable. I am, with 
undiminished attachment, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
</p><p>
