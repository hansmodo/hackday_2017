My Dear Brother : I am going to return to Charleston 
to-night by sea, and expect to be turned wrong side out, 
as the wind is blowing a half gale. I have been to Wilmington in this State to stand by a young friend who 
exchanged the independence of the bachelor for the 
charms of Governor Dudley's daughter. We had a 
brilliant wedding, dinner-parties and balls for three 
days, when I came here to see a friend, and will now 
go home by the first steamboat that comes along. . . . 
I expect upon my arrival at Ft. Moultrie to find a letter 
from mother and yourself, and if I do not good-by, 
for devil the word has reached me from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a> for 
four months. Love to all. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=smithville" rel="city">Smithville</a> is on the Cape 
Fear River, near the outlet. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother,
