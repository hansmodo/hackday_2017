<p><i>[In this connection I give the following letter thanking Mr. Burr for
a copy of the "Old Guard" which he had sent him, and showing also
what, in his opinion, the South had fought for, and of what true
republicanism consists:]</i></p>
<p>
Lexington, Virginia, January 5, 1866.
</p><p>
Mr. C. Chauncey Burr.
</p><p>
My Dear Sir:  I am very much obliged to you for your letter of the
27th ult., and for the number of the 'Old Guard' which you kindly sent
me.  I am glad to know that the intelligent and respectable people at
the North are true and conservative in their opinions, for I believe
by no other course can the right interests of the country be maintained.
All that the South has ever desired was that the Union, as established
by our forefathers, should b e preserved, and that the government as
originally organised should be administered in purity and truth.  If
such is the desire of the North, there can be no contention between
the two sections, and all true patriots will unite in advocating that
policy which will soonest restore the country to tranquility and order,
and serve to perpetuate true republicanism.  Please accept my thanks
for your advocacy of right and liberty and the kind sentiments which
you express toward myself, and believe me to be, with great respect,
</p><p>
                        Your obedient servant,
</p><p>
