I was delighted to receive your last letter, my dearest Mary, as I am always, and 
sorry for your disappointment at not see ing Thomas and his wife. You inquire 
if Count d Orsay has been here? Yes, he spent nearly three weeks with us, off and on, and seemed to enjoy himself very 
much. He is a great sportsman, and would borrow Payne's summer clothes, and go forth, returning as ragged as bushes and 
mire could make him, rest for several days, and then off again, tumbling into the 
river, losing his way and yet come home laughing at his adventures. We found him an elegant young man, sensible and 
well-informed, except on the intricacies of our woods. I forget, now, who introduced him ; I think General Dearborn sent a letter of introduction. 
Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson stayed a week with me, but I have not 
yet heard from Mrs. Grimes and her children, of their time for coming. I must 
tell you that my English beauty has given me a calf as pretty as herself ; tell this to 
dear Dolly that she may be glad with me. Have you any amusing books, no matter 
how old, to lend me ? You see in what haste I write ; tell me everything that you 
are doing, dear girls ; my heart follows you all the time, in spite of my engrossing 
family. It is now late at night, and my eyes close. Dear love to you all. Good night, and sweet dreams !

Your aunt
