Mr. Randolph's pamphlet had arrived before Mr. Hall, 
but I had seen only some extracts from it, which : were and 
yet are dealt out in some of the daily papers here; . I think 
he rolls the stone of Sisyphus with a more impetuous recoil 
than I ever witnessed before. I confess I should never 
have thought that even the delirium of guilt could publish 
such a production, and imagine it would injure the reputation 
of the President, or defend that of the writer. Itf.niy last 
numbered letter to you I mentioned an opinion that the 
party in France would perhaps return to the courting system, 
and I am almost tempted to believe that they advised this 
publication by way of atonement. For it seems to me impossible that the production should have been given to the 
world, but by the agency of a person inveterate even to rancor against Mr. Randolph, and disposed to raise the character 
of the President higher if possible than its former elevation. 
</p><p>
But the publication to the world of confidential. opinions 
and sentiments entertained by the President with respect 
to the European parties and governments, will produce in. a 
degree the effect for which it was calculated; They will 
produce some mischief. The sensation here upon seeing a 
proclamation to all the world that the President has been 
inimical to England, and the friend of the French cause, is 
very perceptible and very strong. It will not only corroborate and confirm that deep rooted malignity towards us 
which governs the cabinet, but it alienates and irritates the part of the nation who are well disposed towards us. 
</p><p>
They have however so much at present upon their hands 
that they will not quarrel with us. But no small use will be 
made of this pamphlet by the Ministers of this country. I 
have reason to suppose that it has given them great satis 
faction, for their purposes concur so thoroughly with those 
of Mr. Randolph, that they seize with delight everything 
that contributes to promote them. It is one of those singularities which seem reserved exclusively for the compli 
cation of political intrigues, that the views of our French 
party and those of the Hawkesbury l conclave here, are exactly the same, and accordingly they are continually playing into each other's hands. 
They wish to perpetuate the variances between the United States and Britain, and ardently catch at everything that has a tendency to that end. 
Upon this subject I think it necessary to give you my 
opinion explicitly. The cabinet here have of late affected 
"". i great regard for the Government of the United States. In 
.this particular too they have coincided with our most virulent 
anarchists, and have taken all possible pains to countenance 
and give credit to their assertions that the American ad 
ministrations were upon terms of great harmony with that 
of Britain. The truth is that the American Government, 
and those who are at the head of its administration, have not 
upon earth more rancorous enemies, than the springs which 
move the executive machine of this country. They know 
perfectly well that the strength, as well as the prosperity, 
of the United States, depend upon the efficiency of the Government ; and above all things they dread the proof which 
any continued course of tranquillity would afford that it is 
a good practical government. In short every one of their 
feelings, individual and national, is hostile to us, and the 
policy of Vergennes and Montmorin to prevent our acquiring a consistency which would make us really formidable, is here envenomed by the recollection of former defeat 
and disappointment. 
</p><p>
Between the United States and Great Britain no cordiality can exist. I do not think it is on our part to be desired. 
But peace may, and I hope will, continue, notwithstanding all the conspiracies that have been formed against it in America and Europe.
