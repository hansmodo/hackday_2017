DEAR SIR * * * * * * 
Stock and scrip continue to be the sole domestic subjects of 
conversation. The former has mounted in the late sales above 
par, from which a superficial inference would be drawn that the 
rate of interest had fallen below 6 per cent. It is a fact, however, which explains the nature of these speculations, that they 
are carried on with money borrowed at from 2^ per cent, a 
month, to 1 per cent, a week. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Yours most affectionately.
