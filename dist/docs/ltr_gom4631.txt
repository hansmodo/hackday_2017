My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the ninth, and will show to the 
bearer, Mr Scott, every attention which my time and affairs 
will permit.

The Swedish Minister, whom you speak of, is not yet arrived, neither do I expect one. The former Ambassador did 
indeed announce to his family, the intention to come hither 
in his way to Switzerland, in order to settle some private affairs. An important negotiation would not be committed to 
him, I think. , f ; ,

Success, as you will see, continues to crown the French 
arms, but it is not our trade to judge from success. We must 
observe the Civil, Moral, Religious and Political Institutions. 
These have a steady and lasting effect, and these only. You 
will soon learn that the patriots, hitherto adored, were but little worthy of the incense they received. The enemies of 
those, who now reign, treat them as they did their predecessors, and as their successors will be treated.

Since I have been in this country, I have seen the worship 
of many idols, and but little of the true God. I have seen 
many of those idols broken, and some of them beaten to dust. 
I have seen the late constitution, in one short year, admired as 
a stupendous monument of human wisdom, and ridiculed as an 
egregious production of folly and vice. I wish much, very 
much, the happiness of this inconstant people. I love them, I 
feel grateful for their efforts in our cause, and I consider the 
establishment of a good constitution here as the principal 
means, under Divine Providence, of extending the blessings of 
freedom to the many millions of my fellow men, who groan in 
bondage on the continent of Europe. But I do not greatly 
indulge the flattering illusions of hope, because I do not yet 
perceive that reformation of morals, without which liberty is 
but an empty sound. I have the honor to be, &c.
