I have a sad tale to tell you of all my ill luck since I 
wrote you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cairo" rel="city">CAIRO</a>. I embarked at that place on 
the " Wave," commanded by Captain White, a very 
clever man. The boat was heavily freighted, having 
three hundred horses, some mules, and about two 
hundred sheep on the lower deck and was certainly 
the slowest team I ever saw. For two days we paddled 
leisurely down stream. I was all anxiety to overtake 
the Second Infantry at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> which in a fast 
boat would have been quite practicable but I despaired on the slow rolling " Wave," and had the 
happiness of shifting my quarters to the " Wing and 
Wing " on the third day. Fast then we sped for the 
Crescent City but a new calamity befell me. I was 
taken sick, evidently threatened with bilious fever. I 
kept up however in the hope of overtaking Colonel 
Riley and on Saturday evening reached here just a 
few hours too late, the Second having left that morning. I was down sick with remittent bilious fever and 
compelled to send for a doctor. By last Friday I was 
convalescent but the doctor would not allow me to 
proceed in a boat which left for Brasos that day, so I 
sent his certificate and reported myself sick here. . . . 
Thursday the twenty-fourth I shall leave for Point 
Isabel in the " McKim," having sufficiently recovered 
my health.
