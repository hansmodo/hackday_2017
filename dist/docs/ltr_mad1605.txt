DEAR SIR * * * * * 
</p><p>
The proposed Constitution still engrosses the public attention. The elections for the Convention here are but just over 
and promulged. From the returns, (excepting those from Kentucky, which are not yet known,) it seems probable, though not 
absolutely certain, that a majority of the members elect are 
friends to the Constitution. The superiority of abilities, at 
least, seems to lie on that side. The characters of most note 
which occur to me are marshaled thus : For the Constitution, 
Pendleton, Wythe, Blair, Lines', Marshall, Doctor W. Jones, G. 
Nicholas, Wilson Nicholas, Gab 1 Jones, Thomas Lewis, F. Corbin, Ralph Wormley, Jr., White of Frederick, General Gates, 
General A. Stephens, Archibald Stuart, Zach y Johnson, Doctor 
Stuart, Parson Andrews, H. Lee, Jr., Bushrod Washington, considered as a young gentleman of talents; against the Constitution, Mr. Henry, Mason, Harrison, Grayson, Tyler, M. Smith, 
W. Ronald, Lawson, Bland, Wm. Cabell, Dawson. 
</p><p>
The Governor is so temperate in his opposition, and goes so 
far with the friends of the Constitution, that he cannot properly 
be classed with its enemies. Monroe is considered by some as 
an enemy, but I believe him to be a friend. There are other 
individuals of weight whose opinions are unknown to me. R. 
H. Lee is not elected. His brother, F. L. Lee, is a warm friend 
to the Constitution, as I am told; but, also, is not elected. So 
are John and Mann Page. 
The adversaries take very different grounds of opposition. 
Some are opposed to the substance of the plan; others, to particular modifications only. Mr. Henry is supposed to aim at 
disunion. Col. Mason is growing every day more bitter and 
outrageous in his efforts to carry his point, and will probably, 
in the end, be thrown by the violence of his passions into the 
politics of Mr. Henry. The preliminary question will be, 
whether previous alterations shall be insisted on or not. 
Should this be carried in the affirmative, either a conditional 
ratification or a proposal for a new Convention will ensue. In 
either event, I think the Constitution and the Union will be 
both endangered. It is not to be expected that the States which 
have ratified will reconsider their determinations, and submit to 
the alterations prescribed by Virginia. And if a second Convention should be formed, it is as little to be expected that the 
same spirit of compromise will prevail in it as produced an 
amicable result to the first. It will be easy, also, for those who 
have latent views of disunion, to carry them on under the mask 
of contending for alterations, popular in some, but inadmissible 
in other parts of the United States. 
</p><p>
The real sense of the people of this State cannot be easily ascertained. They are certainly attached, and with warmth, to a 
continuance of the Union, and I believe a large majority of the 
most intelligent and independent are equally so to the plan 
under consideration. On a geographical view of them, almost 
all the Counties in the Northern Neck have elected federal 
deputies. The Counties on the South side of James River have 
pretty generally elected adversaries to the Constitution. The 
intermediate district is much chequered in this respect. The 
Counties between the blue ridge and the Alleghany have chosen 
friends to the Constitution, without a single exception. Those 
westward of the latter have, as I am informed, generally though 
not universally, pursued the same rule. Kentucky it is supposed 
will be divided. 
</p><p>
Having been in Virginia but a few weeks, I can give you little account of other matters, and none of your private affairs or 
connections, particularly of your two nephews. 
</p><p>
The winter here, as everywhere else in the United States, was 
very severe, which, added to short crops of corn, threatened a 
great scarcity and a high price. It is found, however, that 
neither of these evils has taken place. Corn may be purchased 
for 2 dollars, and even 10s. per barrel. Tobacco is as low at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> as 18s. pr c., and not higher at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> than 
22 or 23s. There is at present a very promising spring, especially in the article of fruit. The night before last was so cold 
as to produce an alarm for the vegetation of all sorts, but it 
does not appear that anything less vulnerable than young cucumbers had been injured. 
</p><p>
I shall ask the favor of Mr. Griffin to send you by Mr. Paradise, or if he should be gone by some other hand, the Debates 
of the Conventions in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, and any 
other publications worth your reading. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your affectionate friend and serv.

England and Scotland formed in 1706, by 32 Commissioners 
appointed for each Kingdom; they sat from April 18th to middle of July; they were appointed by crown, by acts of two parliaments; restrained from treating of Religion. 
</p><p>
The Scotch had got the notion of a federal Union, like Holland and Switzerland. England opposed decidedly; among 
other reasons, because of different Parliaments; either could 
break it when pleased. 
</p><p>
Many had despaired of Union, as Burnet himself. 
</p><p>
In Scotland, opposed violently, particularly by those who 
were for a new revolution, as Union fatal bar to it; carried in 
parliament by inconsiderable majority. The presbyterians 
brought into opposition by persuasion that religious rights 
would be in danger; this argument used most by those known 
to be most adverse to that Religion, especially Dutchess of 
Hamilton and Son, who, as next in succession, hoped for Crown, 
if separate Kingdom. 
</p><p>
General arguments against Union in Scotland: 
</p><p>
1. Antiquity and dignity of Kingdom to be given up and 
sold. 
</p><p>
2. Departing from independent State, and to be swallowed 
by Eng d . 
</p><p>
3. Would be outvoted in all questions by Eng d ' s superiority 
in Par?.* 
</p><p>
4. Scotland no more be regarded by foreign nations. 
</p><p>
5. Danger to the Kirk. 
</p><p>
Finally, Scotch parliament prevailed on to annex conditions 
which adviserv.thought would never be agreed to, and thus the 
plan be defeated. 
</p><p>
Opposerv.of Union, finding majority against them, endeavoured to raise a storm out of doors; petitions, addresses, and 
remonstrances came up from all quarters, instigated by minority; 
even riots excited about parliament House. 
</p><p>
In England, alarm also for Religion, and act passed to secure 
it. House of Commons unanimous; Lords, 50 and 20. 
</p><p>

Two remarkable circumstances: 1. Citizens elect by votes the 
multiples of their property; some rich merchants have several 
hundred votes. 2. Country gentlemen, between nobles and 
peasants, have no votes in electing the latter order; are not 
represented nor eligible at all. Constitution, prior to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1772">1772</a>, alternately Monarchical and aristocratic. Foreign powers had 
chief agency in producing the Revolution of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1772">1772</a>. The King 
had, about that time, only two companies of guards; [power 
of King reduced to its lowest ebb about the time of the Revolution. Sheridan.] [The power of peasants predominant originally; hence alternate anarchy and tyranny. Id.] On death of 
Charles XII, all prerogatives of Executive abolished; hence 
legislative soon exercised Executive and Judicial power both; 
any 3 out of 4 houses competent to legislation. The Revolution 
of '72, owing to unpopularity of diet, owing to abuse of power 
from union of Executive and Judicial with Legislative, factions, 
venality, and foreign influence. The people favoured the enterprize of the King.

The change in 1660, produced by the aversion to the nobility, 
who, as feudal lords, had almost all power, the peasants being 
slaves to them; the two other orders being the clergy and commons or representatives of towns. The Clergy were the great 
agents in the Revolution, and the King rather passive. Lord 
Molesworth saith Denmark differed little from an aristocracy 
when it become an absolute Monarchy.

( a ) [Anno 827.] "Thus were united all the Kingdoms of the Heptarchy in 
one great State, near four hundred years after 1 st arrival of Saxons in Britain, 
[and 250 after establishment;] and the fortunate arms, &c., of Egbert. [King of 
Wessex,] at last effected what had been so often attempted in vain by so many 
Princes." Hume, Vol. 1, p. 59. "Kent, Northumberland, and Mercia, had successively aspired to general dominion." Id., p. 60.

( b ) Question in 1713 in House of Lords for dissolving Union as not answering, 
and ruinous to Scotland. Carried in negative by 4 voices only. Deb. Peers, 11, 
313 ; Burg.. 3, 360. Harrington (pol. Aphorisms, 49, 50, 51, page 517) pronounced 
the Union destructive to both England and Scotland. Heptarchy reduced to 
two after some ages, Mercia and W. Saxons ; and then one, (Egbert,) England 
and Wales prior to Union under Edward I, and more fully under H. VIII. See 
Kennet, vol. 1, page 37, for an apt and short quotation as to Heptarchy. 
</p><p>
States General at Calmar; 40 from each attended and formed 
the Union of Treaty; main argument used by the Queen the 
contentions and wars when disunited. 
</p><p>
Union consisted of three principal articles: 
</p><p>
1. That the three Kingdoms, which was each elective, should 
have the same King, to be elected by turns out of each, with an 
exception, however, in favour of offspring whom the three States 
might elect. 
</p><p>
2. The King to divide his residence by turns among each, 
and to spend in each the revenues of each Crown. 
</p><p>
3. The most important, that each should keep its particular 
Senate, customs, privileges, Governments, magistrates, Generals, Bishops, and even troops and garrisons, to be taken from 
respective Kingdoms, so that the King should never be allowed 
to employ subjects of one in another, being mutually regarded 
as strangers. 
</p><p>
This Union, thus imperfect, increased their mutual animosity, 
and laid the foundation for fresh and more bitter animosities 
and miserv.s. 
</p><p>
Examples of invasions of defenceless coasts. Danger if disunited: 1. Of foreign invasion by sea. 2. Of Eastern invasion

Kings were for life; in other respects like 2 Consuls; Generals during war; presided in Assemblies and public sacrifices in

Senate, composed of persons qualified by age, experience, 
birth, riches; were the Council of State, and the soul of all 
public deliberation; number not known; must have been great, 
since the 100 drawn out of it. Senate treated of great affairs, 
readof Generals, rec d plaints of provinces, gave audiences to ambassadors, and decided peace and war. When 
Senate unanimous, decided finally; in case of division, people 
decided. Whilst Senate retained its authority, says Polybius, 
wisdom and success marked everything. 
</p><p>
People, at first, gave way to Senate; at length, intoxicated 
by wealth and conquests, they assumed all power; then cabals 
and factions prevailed, and were one of the principal causes of 
the ruin of the State.

Tribunal of 100, composed of 104 persons, were in place of 
Ephori, at Sparta, according to Aristotle, and instituted to
