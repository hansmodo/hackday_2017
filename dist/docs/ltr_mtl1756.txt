MR. BRADY, No. 609 Broadway, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>N. Y. City</a> : 
</p><p>
* * * DEAR SIR : The articles I am sending you to dispose of were gifts of dear friends, which only urgent necessity compels me 
to part with, and I am especially anxious that they shall not be sacrificed. 
</p><p>
The circumstances are peculiar, and painfully embarrassing; therefore I hope you will endeavor to realize as much as possible for them. 
Hoping to hear from you, I remain, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
