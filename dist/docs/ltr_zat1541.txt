My Dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your highly acceptable & interesting letter of the 18th ins was duly 
rec d for which I tender you my best thanks. I was pleased to learn the 
wounded officers were on the mend & hope they will not only be able, but 
will very soon leave for their homes or friends in the North or elsewhere. 
At the same time I deeply regretted to hear the other wounded, the n. 
com d officers & privates were not doing so well, & that some of them 
had died, no doubt owing in part to the effects of the dreadful storm you 
had soon after you returned, which prostrated your tents, and perhaps 
other covering which must have exposed them all to its violence, at any 
rate must have wet them through through as far as it could be done, 
besides doing them other serious injury ; but I trust you have since 
been able to make them as comfortable as circumstances would admit of, 
& I feel satis you will do all in your power to restore them to health, as 
soon as it can be done ; I am sorry for want of hands that nothing has 
been done towards fitting up the Long for a hospital, as I had supposed 
she was far on the way towards completion; but in this I fear I have 
been mistaken I regretted to hear that you & Russell were both 
complaining ; alth not dangerous as far as you were concerned, yet your 
disease or complaint must have been painful as well as inconvenient ; but 
it is to be hoped you both if not entirely recovered are in a fair way to 
become so On the subject of your family I fully agree with you, that 
you ought to join them in time to remove & locate them at some 
more eligible place than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> before the navigation closes in the fall, 
let the consequences be what they might, if your life was spared, & 
what is of more consequence than their removal is the situation of the 
boys who as Ann says very correctly, require your personal attention at 
any rate so far as to have them, particularly John placed at once or sent 
to college, or put to some kind of business which would enable him if 
prudent, industrious & persevering to make his way through life ; to 
raise children in idleness, is one of the greatest blunders ever committed 
by parents. As to your little means they are highly important to you, 
but not so much so, as the inculcating proper principles in all the members of your family, as well as business habits in the boys, so that they 
can & must rely on their own exertions for their standing & position in 
life. As to your pecuniary affairs, your brother could attend to them as 
well at a distance, as he could with you present ; and I entertain the 
opinion that your papers deposited in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> bank are perfectly 
safe ; but the great consideration is the unpleasant situation as regards 
residence in winter, your family are placed in & one great consideration 
is to fix on some plan to educate them, which would combine health, 
good society, cheapness of living & good schools for all the children ; of 
this you must agree on after you & Ann meet I shall if continued 
in command & nothing happens more than common to prevent it will give 
you a leave for 60 days in time to enable you to carry out the objects 
under discussion, which is the removal of your family, before the lakes or 
rivers are covered with ice, which ought to be put off as long as could be 
done to be certain of that object, as peace with Mexico may be brought 
about even before that time, otherwise your going may have the effect of 
driving you from the service, but even that should not prevent you from 
going, & if so you must try & do the best you can in private practice. 
You need expect no favors from the head of your dep 1 or those who control it ; they have committed an outrage toward you, which will be followed up by others with the hope of driving you from the service if you 
if you give them the slightest cause or grounds for them to do so. To 
take advantage of such is human nature. They are as well aware of 
your length of service as well as the few indulgencies you have had, as 
you or myself are, but that has no effect in the atmospher of Washing 
ton. The more one does the more they expect of him, and his services 
or standing is estimated by political consideration. There are sinecures 
in every branch of the service & in none more than yours ; Hammond s 1 
position at S l Louis is not dissimilary to many others, & if you could 
have had the prospect of getting into a tolerable decent private practice, 
of which you ought to be the best judge, I can see no objection to your 
quitting. It is now considered almost disreputable to speak or allude to 
one s services. I must say that I deeply regret the disponding way in 
which you write & speak as well as feel in regard to your situation, & 
consider resignation preferable to giving way to such or anything of the 
kind, what we cant remedy should be met & borne with resignation, fortitude & cheerfulness, sighing and giving way to grievances or misfortunes 
never alleviated or corrected them, & those who enter the public service 
out to expect to perform all such duties as are required of them, so far as 
are connected with their profession or engagements, without contrasting 
them with what they require of others 
</p><p>
In my last letters I mentioned to my family Anns wishes for her 
mother & Betty to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> & make her a visit, as well as to spend 
a few months there, which they have my sanction to do & that they could 
go all the way by water through the Ohio canal & by the lakes ; but I 
apprehend the undertaking will be too great for Mrs T. to attempt it in 
her weak health. We have rec d no mail for more than two weeks, the 
last by the Alabama which vessel I do not expect will return ; something 
must have happened to prevent crafts of some description or other reach 
ing Fort Polk. Storms or orders to detain them at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> to bring 
out <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> or Col Whiting or some other dignitary, must have 
occurred to prevent. I am perfectly disgusted with the way they are 
going on, I consider there is an entire breakdown in the Q r M. depart 
ment every where ; there are now 10,000 men here & in its vicinity, 
waiting & a portion of them a month for a few small steam boats & waggons to carry their provisions &c toward the enemy, which have been 
required more than a month, time enough to have sent to Liverpool for 
them, wiout having heard a word of or from them, up to the present 
time. Was I a prominent or ambitious aspirent for civil distinction or 
honors, I might very readily suppose there was an intention somewhere 
among the high functionaries to break me down, which am now satisfied 
will be done ; whether intended or not ; as the large force now under my 
command will from design or incompetency of others, have to return 
to their homes without accomplishing anything commensurate with their 
numbers, the responsibility of which will be thrown on me ; the question 
will be asked why did the troops lay idle, & why did they not march 
against the enemy no matter where he was, find, fight & beat him. No 
matter how much I may be annoyed & vexed at the unpleasant situation 
in which I find myself placed by the conduct of others, which is not a 
little vexatious I am determined not to let it throw me off my balance, & 
as long as I am satisfied with my own course so far as remaining at my 
post &c is concerned I shall be content. I want nothing more than to 
see this campaign finished & the war brought to a speedy and honorable 
close, & then to be permitted to be quiet the balance of my days.

I hope Dick returned to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a>, & if indisposed remained with 
his mother until entirely recovered when he can join me or not, as he 
may think best ; this is no place for him if he was unwell, much less if 
seriously indisposed. The best way to manage the sutlers is to be positive & determined with them ; mild or half-way measures with such 
people will have no effect ; they are perfect sharks. 
</p><p>
I am entirely satisfied the days of the Gen are numbered as regards 
efficiency, & that dep is now in the hands of the wicked and designing, 
who are irresponsible, so we go 
</p><p>
There is a foolish story here, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>, & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> has 
had a serious misunderstanding, growing out of the Genl s declining to 
come here, as it would interfere with his prospects & necessary steps to 
enable him to succeed in being elected president in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a>. That a misunderstanding may have taken place between those high functionaries is 
quite likely but the cause assigned is too ridiculous to be entertained for a 
moment. They need have no apprehensions of being interfered with by 
me for that high office, which I would decline if proffered & I could 
reach it without opposition. 
</p><p>
I have observed with some regret the great excitability of our people 
on subject of war growing out of recent events as well their running with 
individuals for achievements against the enemy in battle, which are some 
times carried too far, in the way of rewards, but more frequently after 
being too highly lauded, the same individual who was but yester more 
than a hero, is to-morrow the variest poltroon & wretch imaginable. 
</p><p>
It does not become me to speak of the affairs of the 8th  & 9th of May 1 in comparison with other important battles of our country, but 
except in its consequences which was the saving of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> I do not 
consider that of the 8th  of Janr? surpassed if it equalled them & that of 
the Thames3 was trifling when compared to them ; but I must leave it to 
others to draw such comparisons Judging from an order recently pub 
lished for Gen Wool & others to muster into service the 12 months 
volunteers, I feel satisfied I am to be superseded by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>, or some 
one else but be it by whom it may, I shall not have the slightest objection, & will cheerfully cooperate & take the orders of who ever it may 
be, until early in November, when I must return home if possible, as my 
private affairs imperiously require my attention at that time I 
neglected in my last letters to say the money you sent by L l Reynolds5 
was duly rec d & I much fear you sent too large an am & did not pay 
for the several articles you procured for me out of the same 
</p><p>
Mr Eaton & Majr Craig 6 returned last night, by them learn that all 
the wounded officers with the exception of Col Mclntosh had left, which 
must be a great relief to the medical officers. Mr . E. or the mail brought 
up your certificate for sick leave for Dr Russell, whose services can be badly 
spared at this time My nephew who came up here is name Joseph a 
younger brother of Lewis I regretted to see him as I presume he is 
necessary with his mother & family who must stand very much in need 
of his services at home 
</p><p>
Col Garland 1 informed me he saw a statement in a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> paper, 
that Col Taylor 1 had been ordered to hold himself in readiness to join 
the army of occupation ; if so it is strange Ann does not mention it 
</p><p>
My love to dear Ann & the children when you write them, as well 
as regards to all friends at the Point, and begging you will keep up your 
spirits & look more on the bright side of things, I remain 
</p><p>
Your friend
