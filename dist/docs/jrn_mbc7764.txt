<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. The Fants say all the trouble at the hotel came from our servants bragging. They represented 
us as millionaires, and the Middleton men servants smoked cigars. Mrs. Reed's averred that he had never done any 
thing in his life but stand behind his master at table with a silver waiter in his hand. We were charged accordingly, 
but perhaps the landlady did not get the best of us after all, for we paid her in Confederate money. Now that they 
won't take Confederate money in the shops here how are we to live? Miss Middleton says quartermasters families 
are all clad in good gray cloth, but the soldiers go naked. Well, we are like the families of whom the novels always say 
they are poor but honest. Poor? Well-nigh beggars are we, for I do not know where my next meal is to come from.

Called on Mrs. Ben Rutledge to-day. She is lovely, exquisitely refined. Her mother, Mrs. Middleton, came in. 
" You are not looking well, dear ? Anything the matter ? No but, mamma, I have not eaten a mouthful to-day. 
The children can eat mush; I can't. I drank my tea, how ever. She does not understand taking favors, and, blushing violently, refused to let me have Ellen make her some biscuit. I went home and sent her some biscuit all the same.
