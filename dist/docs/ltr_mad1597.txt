DEAR SIR, I have at length the pleasure to enclose you the 
favorable result of the Convention at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. The amendments are a blemish, but are in the least offensive form. The 
minority, also, is very disagreeably large, but the temper of 
it is some atonement. I am assured by Mr. King that the leaders of it, as well as the members of it in general, are in good 
humor, and will countenance no irregular opposition, there or 
elsewhere. The Convention of New Hampshire is now sitting. 
There seems to be no question that the issue there will add a 
seventh pillar, as the phrase now is, to the federal Temple. 
</p><p>
With the greatest respect and attachment, I am, Dear Sir, 
yrs.
