My dear General, 
</p><p>
I was early convinced, upon your Excellency's retirement from public life, that too much of your time, 
for your own happiness, was engrossed by a correspondence as extensive as is the knowledge of letters, and by the frequent visits of people throughout 
the equally extended limits. An idea that these visits were multiplied by the ease with which people 
obtained letters of introduction to your Excellency, 
has restrained me from giving such letters but in a 
few instances, lest I should be instrumental in adding to your cares, and breaking in upon your domestic tranquillity. At this day. Sir, I ought to be more 
upon my guard than ever, as your burdens are multiplied, and as joiw whole time must be engrossed 
by the important calls of your elevated office. While 
under this conviction, I hope and trust that I shall 
not exceed the bounds of propriety. I consider, however, that there are instances, which to neglect would 
be highly criminal, and might justly be considered as 
a neglect of duty to your Excellency and to the 
public. Such I consider the instance now before me. 
</p><p>
This letter will be honored by its being borne by 
the Honorable George Cabot. Feeling, as all others do, an esteem for and obligations to your Excellency, 
he intends to wait upon you and express them. I hope his business will permit him to remain a little time with you, for I am sure your Excellency will 
find him a gentleman, in all respects perfectly agreeable. From his abilities, his integrity, his knowledge 
of the world, of commerce in general, and its connections with the different nations, our interest with them 
and with each other, I cannot help considering him an honor to our country, and one of the most able 
and useful men in it. lie has been drawn into public life ; but we have not had influence enough to 
retain him. If your Excellency should have time to 
open with him on the state of trade here, on its foreign and domestic connections, you will receive a 
very judicious relation; and such a one as will be 
pleasing, and throw light on the interesting and important subject, and as free from personal views and 
those local prejudices which have so often clogged 
our public proceedings and given a false coloring to 
them, as from any man I know on earth. 
</p><p>
Fearing that he would call, as thousands of others 
must do, without being particularly known, I have 
taken the liberty to beg it as a favor that he would 
take charge of this letter, and deliver it with his 
own hand. I have been urged to this from the fullest conviction that the happiness arising from an interview would be reciprocal. Captain Brown, formerly 
of Glover's regiment, and who was with your Excellency at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, now a very respectable merchant 
in this State, will accompany Mr. Cabot. I have the 
honor of being, with the most perfect esteem, my 
dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, &c., 
</p><p>
