Sir, 
I wrote to your Excellency a day or two ago by 
express. Since that, a Committee, appointed on the 
communications from you, have had a meeting, and 
find themselves embarrassed. They have requested 
me to communicate our embarrassments to you in 
confidence, and to ask your private opinion. The army, by their resolutions, express an expectation that 
Congress will not disband them previous to a settlement of accounts, and the establishment of funds. 
Congress may resolve upon the first, but the General opinion is that they cannot constitutionally declare 
the second. They have no right by the Confederation to demand funds ; they can only recommend ; and 
to determine that the army shall be continued in service till the States grant them, would be to determine 
that the whole present army shall be a standing army during peace, unless the States comply with the 
requisitions for funds. This, it is supposed, would 
excite the alarms and jealousies of the States, and 
increase rather than lessen the opposition to the funding scheme. 
</p><p>
It is also observed, that the longer the army is 
kept together the more the payment of past dues is 
procrastinated, the abilities of the States being exhausted for their immediate support, and a new debt 
every day incurred. It is further suggested, that 
there is danger in keeping the army together in a 
state of inactivity, and that a separation of the several lines would facilitate the settlement of accounts, 
diminish present expense, and avoid the danger of 
union. It is added, that the officers of each line, 
being on the spot, might, by their own solicitations, 
and those of their friends, forward the adoption of 
funds in the different States. 
</p><p>
A proposition will be transmitted to you by Colonel Bland, in the form of a resolution to be adopted 
by Congress, framed upon the principles of the foregoing reasoning. Another proposition is contained in 
the following resolution ; â€” 
</p><p>
" That the Commander-in-chief be informed, it is the 
intention of Congress to effect the settlement of the 
accounts of the respective lines, previous to their reduction ; and that Congress are doing, and will continue to do, every thing in their power towards procuring satisfactory securities for what shall be found 
due on such settlement." 
</p><p>
The scope of this, your Excellency will perceive 
without comment. I am to request you will favor me with your sentiments on both the propositions, and, 
in general, with your ideas of what had best be done 
with reference to the expectation expressed by the 
officers; taking into view the situation of Congress. 
On one side, the army expect they will not be disbanded till accounts are settled, and funds established. 
On the other hand, they have no constitutional power 
of doing any thing more than to recommend funds ; 
and are persuaded that these will meet with mountains of prejudice in some of the States. 
</p><p>
A considerable progress has been made in a plan 
for funding the public debts ; and it is to be hoped 
it will ere long go forth to the States, with every 
argument that can give it success. I have the honor 
to be, with sincere respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
