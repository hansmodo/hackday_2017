MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I am much delighted to learn that you intend making 
a visit to the old mansion. I wish you could have 
accomplished it so as to have been here by this 
time, which would have given you an opportunity of 
being at Commencement, meeting many of your 
old acquaintance, and visiting the seat of science, 
where you received your first rudiments. I shall 
look daily for you. You will find your father in his 
fields, attending to his hay-makers, and your mother 
busily occupied in the domestic concerns of her 
family. I regret that a fortnight of sharp drought 
has shorn many of the beauties we had in rich luxuriance. The verdure of the grass has become a brown, 
the flowers hang their heads, droop, and fade, whilst 
the vegetable world languishes ; yet still we have a 
pure air. The crops of hay have been abundant ; 
upon this spot, where eight years ago we cut scarcely six tons, we now have thirty. " We are here, 
among the vast and noble scenes of nature, where 
we walk in the light and open ways of the divine 
bounty, and where our senses are feasted with the 
clear and genuine taste of their objects." 
</p><p>
" Who, that has reason and his smell, 
Would not among roses and jasmine dwell, 
Rather than all his spirits choke 
"With exhalations of dirt and smoke, 
And all the uncleanness which does drown 
In pestilential clouds a populous town." 
</p><p>
At this season, it is best to take the packet by way 
of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>.

I have received Mr. J 's play. It is better executed than I believed him capable of performing. 
As a youthful specimen of genius, it has merit. I presume S has sent you Mr. Paine's Oration upon July the 4th. I think you will be pleased with it. 
I am, my dear Thomas, 
</p><p>
Affectionately your mother, 
</p><p>
A. A.
