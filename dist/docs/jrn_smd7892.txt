It required very little persuasion to induce those 
gentlemen to stay to supper, the other evening, and 
it was quite late before they took their leave. Dr. Addison I was very much pleased with, and so were 
all the rest. Mr. M , none of us fell desperately 
in love with. He is too nonchalant and indifferent, 
besides having a most peculiar pronunciation which 
grated harshly on my ears, and that no orthography 
could fully express. "Garb," for instance, was distorted into "gairb," "yard" into "yaird," "Airkansas," and all such words that I can only imitate by a 
violent dislocation of my lower jaw that puts Anna 
into convulsions of laughter only she would laugh 
the same if it was not funny. This Kentuckian pronunciation grates "hairshly" on my Southern ears. 
Miriam addressed herself exclusively to the Doctor, 
so I was obliged to confine my attention entirely to 
neglected Mr. M , in which pious duty I was 
ably and charitably seconded by the General. 
Speaking of the bravery and daring displayed by the 
Southern soldiers during this war, Mr. M - mentioned the dangerous spot he had seen us in the first 
day we went down to the "Airkansas" and said 
that, lying directly across the point from the Essex, 
they expected every instant to see one of her shells 
explode among us, and were very uneasy about our 
position, as we did not seem to know the danger. I 
asked him if he had observed anything peculiar 
among the dozen planters and overseers standing a 
short distance from us, when the Captain sent us 
word that our position was a very dangerous one, as 
they expected the Essex to open fire every instant, 
and we had best stand below the levee, higher up, 
where we would be safe from shells. " I noticed that 
before any of you understood your position, every 
man had disappeared as though by magic." Now 
I had noticed that myself. When I turned, under 
shelter of the levee, our gallant planters were galloping off in the distance. While Ginnie and I looked 
and laughed, we suddenly found ourselves the sole 
objects on the horizon ; the other girls were in the road 
below, going carelessly toward the carriage; so we 
followed, having lost sight of the brave representatives of Southern chivalry, being the last to leave 
the supposed field of danger. To my former remark, 
let me add that there is only one set who take better 
care for their safety than married women ; and that 
set is composed exclusively of the "Home Guard." 
Timid girls, either through ignorance or fun, compose the majority of the brave "men" that the volunteer service has not absorbed.
