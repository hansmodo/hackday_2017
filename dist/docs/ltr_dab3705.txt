Dear General, 
</p><p>
I have this moment received intelligence, that the 
enemy from Detroit intend paying a visit to this frontier. Major Lanctot has wrote me in French, and 
I take the liberty to inclose a copy of the translation. The Delaware runners add, that a party of 
twenty Indian warriors have been discovered, about 
six days ago, marching towards these settlements, 
and that a large party of Senecas may soon be expected down the Alleghany River. 
</p><p>
Last week seven persons were killed and taken by 
the savages, in an interior settlement on Ten Mile 
Creek. As no supply of goods has yet been sent 
for the Delaware Indians, agreeably to treaty, I conceive they will be compelled to make terms with the 
British, or perish; and next spring we shall have a 
general Indian war. 
</p><p>
If I had a sufficient number of men, and a supply 
of provisions, I should be happy to meet the enemy, 
before they reach the posts or settlements ; but I see 
no method, but force, to obtain it, and the mills cannot grind for want of water. 
</p><p>
Should this intelligence prove true (and I have no 
reason to doubt it), I will do all I can to oppose the 
designs of the enemy; but my regular force is very 
small, and the inhabitants will be in the greatest 
dread imaginable. Indeed, I expect they think more 
of flight than resistance. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. The Delaware messengers say, that Captain 
McIntyre's party killed eighteen or nineteen of the 
Wyandots that were crossing the Ohio, as mentioned 
in a former letter.
