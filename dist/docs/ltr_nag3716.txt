Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I had the honor of addressing your Excellency last, there have been some changes in our circumstances. On the 2d, Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, with 
a detachment of riflemen, attacked the advance of the 
British army under Colonel Tarleton, near Alamanee, 
and killed and wounded, by report, about thirty of 
them. On the 6th, the British moved down towards 
High Rock, either with a view to intercept our 
stores, or cut off the light infantry from the main 
body of the army, then advanced near seven miles ; 
but they were handsomely opposed, and suffered considerably, without effecting any thing. 
</p><p>
This manoeuvre occasioned me to retire over the 
Haw River, and move down the north side of it, 
with a view to secure our stores coming to the army, 
and to form a junction with several considerable reenforcements of Carolina and Virginia militia, and 
one regiment of Virginia eighteen-months' men, on 
the march from Hillsborough to High Rock. I effected this business, and the enemy retired towards 
Guilford Court-House. Our militia had been upon 
such a loose and uncertain footing ever since we 
crossed the Dan, that I could attempt nothing with 
confidence, though we kept within ten or twelve 
miles of the enemy for several days. The enemy 
kept close, seemingly determined that we should 
gain no advantage of them without risking something 
of consequence. I have the honor to be, with great 
respect and esteem, &c.,
