My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have barely time to thank you for your packet of 
the 12th , and to express my great concern at the cause 
of your confinement. The pain arising from your 
malady must be aggravated by its happening at a time 
when you have the most important public affairs on 
your mind ; but I hope it will neither be so durable 
nor so grievous as you seem to expect. Your own 
philosophy and the assurance of the sympathy of your 
friends will greatly mitigate the evil. I return two 
of the letters which you sent me, for your perusal; 
the others were from M w Laurens; the last dated gives 
me a title to expect her arrival in Carolina in company with Mr Blake's family. 
</p><p>
The army cross'd the Schuylkil on the 13th and has 
remained encamped on the heights on this side. Our 
truly republican general has declared to his officers 
that he will set the example of passing the winter in 
a hut himself. The precise position is not as yet 
fixed upon, in which our huts arc to be constructed ; 
it will probably be determined this day; it must 
be in such a situation as to admit of a bridge of communication over the Schuylkil for the protection of 
the country we have just left; far enough from the 
enemy not to be reached in a day's march, and properly interposed between the enemy and the most 
valuable part of this country on this side Schuylkil. 
With anxious prayers for your recovery, 
</p><p>
I am your most dutiful and affectionate 
</p><p>

Berry received a hunting shirt and a check shirt. If there be any difficulty in getting him winter clothes I believe he can do without.

The last plundering and foraging party of the enemy under L'd Cornwallis on this side Schuylkil have 
gone beyond themselves in barbarous treatment of the inhabitants.
