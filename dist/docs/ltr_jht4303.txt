Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
By some unaccountable delay, the letter with which 
you have favored me, of the 13th instant, did not 
reach me till the 30th. While writing mine of the 
2d of this month, the doubt which you have been 
pleased to mention, respecting the law of Congress 
fixing the seat of Government, occurred to me ; but, 
turning to the law, I found the fifth section mentions, 
" That prior, &c., all offices attached to the seat of 
Government shall be removed to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, &c., at 
which place, the session of Congress next ensuing, shall 
be held." The sixth section mentions, "That in the 
year <a href='/results.php?year=1800'>1800</a> the seat of Government shall be transferred, &c., and all offices, &c. shall be also removed, 
&c.;" but not a word of the Legislature; by which 
it would seem it is left to its own adjournment, and 
the discretion of the President on extra occasions. Indeed, I conceived that the Constitution, in granting 
this discretion, must have contemplated Place, as well 
as time, of meeting ; because the necessity for its exercise might be grounded equally in one as the 
other. Witness the existing instance, the first that 
has occurred. 
</p><p>
Moreover, the Constitution must be paramount to 
the law in such cases ; otherwise, the power granted 
may be so controlled as not to be sufficient to surmount the necessity of the occasion. The like necessity may also exist under other circumstances ; such 
as the total destruction of the city by fire, or other 
means ; its being in complete possession of an enemy, 
and other insurmountable calamities which might occur. Ill all which cases if the law, fixing the seat 
of Government, must rise superior to the Constitution, the discretionary power of the President, calculated to afford a remedy under such exigencies, must 
be futile, and prove totally inadequate to the purposes for which it was intended. 
</p><p>
I also considered that, should doubts arise, they 
would be easily obviated by reflecting that this exercise of discretion could not be dangerous, because it 
would be in the power of Congress, as soon as met, 
to remedy the evil, should they apprehend any, by 
an immediate adjournment to wherever they might 
judge proper. Besides, it is calculated to remedy an 
existing inconvenience and danger to themselves, 
which in its nature is only temporary, and is hoped 
to prove of but short continuance. 
</p><p>
As to the place of meeting, I am very sensible it 
wall be an object of delicacy to decide. When I took 
the liberty to suggest the hints I gave to you, this 
difficulty presented itself; and I was then almost 
tempted to add a word on that head, but was repressed by the fear of assuming too much. I therefore now mention, what I before thought, that in casting about, it is probable the towns of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> will present themselves to your mind as 
the most convenient places. To the latter, I am sensible, objections will be started by some, notwithstanding its superior advantages, perhaps, for the present 
temporary occasion. To obviate, therefore, these objections to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, should they appear with weight, 
and to save any uneasiness in the minds of our southern brethren from that quarter, I have thought for 
myself (and in this I have been joined by others) 
that I should perfectly acquiesce in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. I 
should mention the expedient of convening Congress somewhere in the vicinity of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and leave 
the final decision of i^lace to their determination, 
but that I fear such event may occasion disputes 
and delay, not to say heats, perhaps, which might 
prove much more detrimental to our general interests 
than your fixing, at once, a place by your own judgment and discretion. I most sincerely hope that, 
whatever place is appointed, the melancholy occasion 
of lea^nng <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> may speedily be removed, and 
that Congress may soon be able to return to that 
city again. 
</p><p>
With real regard and respect, I am, &c. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jht" rel="me">Jonathan Trumbull</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Before closing this letter we are gratified 
with much more favorable accounts from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
than for some time past. I really hope they may 
prove true, and that circumstances in that distressed 
city may continue to meliorate, so that you may 
have complete relief from your present dilemma on 
that score.
