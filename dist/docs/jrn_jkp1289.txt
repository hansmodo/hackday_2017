Saw company this morning until near twelve o'clock. Among the visitors, were several members of Congress, to whom I spoke very freely of the inexcusable delay of Congress in acting upon the war measures which I have recommended. . .

The Cabinet met, all the members present except the Secretary of the Treasury, who was understood to be at the Capitol pressing members to push the speedy passage of the loan-bill. The published letter of General Taylor and General Gaines's avowal that it had been addressed to him and had been published by his permission (see yesterday's diary) were considered. The Cabinet were unanimous in condemning Taylor for writing such a letter and Gaines for publishing it, as being not only unmilitary and a violation of their duty as officers, but calculated seriously to embarrass and injure the pending military operations in Mexico. It was agreed that a letter should be written by the Secretary of War to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor</a> condemning his conduct. It was agreed also that as the letter had been published in several public journals, it should be republished in the Washington Union with proper comments. The Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy stepped into My private secretary's office and prepared an article for the paper. The Secretary of State took their draft and prepared one from it Which I thought too mild but assented to in this form. The Secretary of War took it with him when he retired.

It is two years ago this day since I left my residence at Columbia, Tennessee, to enter on my duties as President of the United States. Since that time I have performed great labour and incurred vast responsibilities. In truth, though I occupy a very high position, I am the hardest-working man in this country.
