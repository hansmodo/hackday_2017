Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It is a great while since any letters have passed between 
us ; perhaps some of them have miscarried. The season 
reminds me that I have survived the last year, and that I 
have left with it a great number who enjoyed more health 
and strength. Many friendly wishes have, as usual, been 
reciprocated on this occasion, but it seems to be questionable whether an average proportion of them will be realized. Public adversity, you know, is at variance with 
individual happiness ; and it has not yet become very 
probable that this will be a happy year to our country. I 
should rejoice to find myself mistaken, but I cannot be persuaded that general prosperity will be restored while our nation continues to be misled by the delusions which 
caused, and which prolong our calamities. We have not 
only declared war unwisely, but have also unwisely 
(though not unwittingly) excited disgust and resentment. 
How far angry passions will retard the return of peace 
may be conjectured, rather than calculated. We are yet 
to learn whether the result of the negotiations at Vienna 
will impede or promote those at Ghent. While the former 
are pending, I suspect that Britain will not be anxious to 
obviate delays. To me, personally, these things cannot 
long be very interesting, but I feel for those whom I shall 
leave behind me. You are in the way of knowing more 
about our national affairs than I am, and I sincerely wish 
that your views of them may be more consoling than mine 
are. 
</p><p>
My health continues to wear away, but I seldom suffer 
severe pain. Conversation, books, and recollections still 
enable me, with the blessing of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, to amuse confinement, and to glide on placidly towards that ocean to 
which the stream of time is bearing us all. 
</p><p>
Tell me how you do. With constant esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
