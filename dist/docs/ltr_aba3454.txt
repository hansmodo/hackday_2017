SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of July 22 was by some mistake in the 
post-office at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> sent back as far as <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
so that it did not reach me until the eleventh of this 
month. Candor requires of me a reply. Your statement inspecting Callender, and your motives for 
liberating him wear a different aspect as explained 
by you, from the impression which the act had 
made, not only upon my mind, but upon the minds 
of all those whom 1 have ever heard speak upon 
the subject. With regard to the law under which 
he was punished, different persons entertain different opinions respecting it. It lies not with me to 
determine its validity or constitutionality. That devolved upon the Supreme Judges of the nation. I 
have ever understood that the power which makes a 
law is only competent to the repeal of it. If a 
Chief Magistrate can by his will annul it, where is 
the difference between a republican and a despotic 
government ? 
</p><p>
That some restraint should be laid upon the 
assassin who stabs reputation, all civilized nations 
have assented to. In no country have calumny, falsehood and reviling stalked abroad more licentiously 
than in this. No political character has been secure 
from its attacks ; no reputation so fair as not to be 
Wounded by it, until truth and falsehood lie in one 
undistinguished heap. If there is no check to be 
resorted to in the laws of the land, and no reparation 
to be made to the injured, will not man become the 
Judge and avenger of his own wrongs, and, as in a 
late instance, the sword and pistol decide the contest ? All christian and social virtues will be banished the land. All that makes life desirable and 
softens the ferocious passions of man will assume 
a savage deportment, and like Cain of old, every 
man's hand will be against his neighbor. Party 
spirit is blind, malevolent, uncandid, ungenerous, 
unjust and unforgiving. It is equally so under federal as under democratic banners, and it would be 
difficult to decide which is the least guilty. Upon 
both sides are characters who possess honest views 
and act from honorable motives ; who disdain to be led 
blindfold, and who, though entertaining different sentiments, have for their object the public welfare and 
happiness. These are the characters who abhor calumny and evil speaking, and who will never descend 
to newspaper reviling. You have done <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> 
justice in believing him incapable of such conduct. 
He has never written a line in any newspaper to 
which his signature has not been affixed since he 
w r as first elected President of the United States. The 
writers in the public papers and their employers are 
altogether unknown to him. 
</p><p>
I have seen and known that much of the conduct 
of a public ruler is liable to be misunderstood and 
misrepresented. Party hatred, by its deadly poison, 
blinds the eyes and envenoms the heart. It is fatal 
to the integrity of the moral character it sees not 
that wisdom dwells with moderation, and that firmness of conduct is seldom united with outrageous 
violence of sentiment. Thus blame is too often liberally bestowed upon actions, which if fully understood and candidly judged, would merit praise. And 
it is only by the general issue of measures producing 
baneful or beneficial effects, that they ought to be 
tested. You exculpate yourself from any intentional 
act of unkindness towards any one. I will, however, 
freelv state that which I considered as such. Soon 
after my eldest son's return from Europe, he was 
appointed by the District Judge to an office in which 
no political concerns entered. Personally known to 
you, and possessing all the qualifications, you yourself being judge, which you had designated for office, 
as soon as Congress gave the appointments to the 
President, you removed him. This looked so particularly pointed, that some of your best friends in 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> at that time expressed their regret that you 
had done so. I must do him the justice to say that 
I never heard an expression from him of censure or 
disrespect towards you in consequence of it. With 
pleasure I say, that he is not a blind follower of any 
party. 
</p><p>
I have written to you with a freedom which only 
former friendship would warrant ; and to which I 
would gladly return, could all causes but mere difference of opinion be removed. I wish to lead a tranquil and retired life under the administration of the 
government, disposed to heal the wounds of contention, to cool the raging fury of party animosity, 
to soften the rugged spirit of resentment, and desirous of seeing my children and grandchildren heirs 
to that freedom and independence which you and 
your predecessor united your efforts to obtain. 
With these sentiments, I reciprocate my sincere 
wishes for your health and happiness.
</p><p>
Abigail Adams.
