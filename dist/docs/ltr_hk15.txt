Sunnyvale, Calif. <br> Nov. 6th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> Wed. A.M. <br><br> Dear Horace, <br> Your letter of Oct. 15th rec’d. I was sure you were in those battles so I was 
not greatly surprised to hear of the accident which befell you. We are so thankful 
it is no worse. I read a letter in the S.J. paper written by Lieutenant Frank 
Kelly of Co. B 362 Inf. telling his experience and i was very sure you were nearby 
the same [unintelligible phrase] and sleeping in the woods and the pouring rain. 
I hope the whole wretched cruel business will be over before you have to go back. 
Today is election day and am running the ranch alone as father has his usual place 
on the Election Board. Am sorry about the letters but it is just the same with 
all the boys about here, Jay hasn’t ahd a letter for 4 months. have just had letters 
from Eleanor and Mona - said they had written twice to Uncle Horace. You will 
get them sometime somewhere in France. Wed. A.M. Father came home late last night 
almost [unintelligible] and this morning everything is white south [unintelligible] 
but it is a bright sunshiny day. there was only 29 votes cast in our precinct. 
Probably are not greatly interested in the election just at the present time. 
All are far more interested in seeing the end of the dreadful war, the return 
of the dear boys that are left; though it would be a good thing to get down to 
some prices. Things are going down fast with the prospect of an end of the war. 
I certainly hope you will begin to get your letters soon. There will be a lot 
of them if they do reach you for I have written every week and of course there 
are lots of others who have written. I hope you will be able to go over to England 
and look around before you cross. Your grandfather’s home was in Herefordshire, 
his birthplace Kington. Well will write again in a few days. <br> much love from Mother <br> S. King
