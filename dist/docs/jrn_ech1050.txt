One who has not been in California can hardly credit the changes that take place here in a very short period of time. But one short year ago I was crossing the barren plains on foot. The wandering gold hunter in traversing our mountains and desert then had to carry everything he required with him, his blanket, his provisions, his frying-pan and his tea-kettle. He
would often travel a whole day in some parts of the country without coming to a single habitation where a cup of tea could be procured. Often have I footed it a distance of fifteen or twenty miles over a burning, dusty plain, without being able to get a drop of water unless I carried it with me from the last camping ground. Now everything is different. No canteen is necessary. You need not even carry your blankets, for all along the roads trading tents and good houses are erected, where travellers can be accommodated with good meals as well as a good clean bed.
</p><p>
This is not the only change which has taken place. We have plenty of the good things of this world. Provisions of all kinds can be bought now for less than half what they could then. At that time prices ranged about as follows:Flour, per 100 lbs., $50 to $75; Pilot Bread, $75 to $100 per 100 lbs.; Potatoes, 75 cents and $1.00 per lb.; Fresh Beef, 50 cents; Salt Pork, $1.00, etc. Now they can be had as follows:Flour, $10 to $14; Pilot Bread we have none for we can all get Baker's Bread; Potatoes, $12 to $15 per bu.; Fresh Beef, 25 cents per lb.; Salt Pork, 18 to 25 cents per lb.; etc. Last summer I paid $16 per week for two meals per day; now I could get much better board with three meals per day for $8 and $10. We still do our own cooking and washing but have not yet introduced the starch cup or smoothing iron, and we don't expect to until we return to civilized life again.

As a general thing miners are doing tolerably well. By working hard and living economically, they can save four to five and six dollars per day. The general average, however, will hardly range as high as this. Many of these hard-working American miners are, I regret to say, victims of the gambling hells. But we
must consider the circumstances by which they are surrounded. They work hard from morning till night, mostly live in tents, and do their own cooking. When evening comes, they have no comfortable home to go to. The gambling saloon is the most comfortable place they can find, hence they resort to it, and go on step by step until they lose their money as fast as they can make it.
</p><p>
I must tell what you will see by entering one of these gambling saloons. We will walk into the Empire Saloon. Behind a long counter on your right four men are kept busy in handing out bottles of liquor and weighing out the gold dust therefor at two bits per drink. A little farther on you will observe a fair-skinned Spanish señorita behind a counter filled with sweetmeats, upon which is a large urn filled with hot coffee. The handsome and graceful señoritas are greatly admired by the gold seekers. We will each take a cup of coffee, pay our four bits, and proceed to the farther end of the room, where upon a gallery erected for the purpose, we find a full band discoursing sweet music.
</p><p>
The walls of the room are hung with numerous lascivious paintings, and down through the middle of the room stand some eight or ten Monte, Roulette, and Faro tables, loaded with piles of silver and large bags of gold dust, and surrounded with crowds of persons of all ages, sex and color, from the pale-faced Frenchman to the ebon Ethiopian. Later in the night when the players become excited, you can see thousands of dollars change owners upon the turn of a single card.
