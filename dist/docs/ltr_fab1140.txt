You appear to be very much afraid of the Small Pox. I hope you won't get it and lose your beauty, but it is not so much to be dreaded as you imagine. We have it here in some part of the State all the time and no one notices it. It is taking off the poor kanakas at the Sandwich Islands at an awful rate and it is thought that the cholera will just clean them all out. It is strange that wherever the American people settle, the natives, be they Indians, Kanakas or Spaniards, gradually melt away; and I firmly believe in the doctrine of manifest destiny, that we shall yet overrun the whole continent and spread out on the Islands and into Asia.

Our success in business stopped about the 1st of July. Since that time we have done scarcely nothing. The water dried up and business has been poor. No money and the hardest kind of work to collect debts. With a great many I am afraid we never shall collect. We have a Celestial for a clerk and he is very successful in trading with his countrymen. These Chinese are the greatest traders in the world. They lay over the genuine Yankee even in buying and selling. All of them appear to be well educated in their language and can calculate how much a bill of goods comes to in their heads quicker than I can.
'Ahyung,' who is with us, speaks good English and is very industrious. They are first-rate cooks. I wish you had one for a servant.

It has rained every month this year and lately we have had heavy rains and thunder showers frequently. The rivers and creeks have risen from four to six feet, to the great damage of the miners at work fluming them. Since I wrote you the community here has been very quiet. We have had our election and been beaten by the great unwashed Democracy, of course, although it is still doubtful whether Bigler or Waldo is governor. But here in our own County the Democratic ticket has all been elected. If ever I entended to figure in political affairs or wanted office I should have come out a Democrat long since. They stick to their party and vote the regular ticket no matter if the Devil himself heads it. They never bolt. The Whig Party, besides being in a minority, split up and vote for all their friends. There never will be another such a chance to elect a Whig governor again but it shows what a state of discipline the Democratic Party is in in this State.

The landlord of the Miners Hotel struck a man on the head with a club, from the effects of which he died that night. The man was drunk and disorderly. The Sheriff arrested a gambler. While conveying him to his office he drew a bowie knife and got away. The Sheriff drew a revolver and ordered him to surrender. He refused and he shot him through the heart and all the people cried Amen. This is all the remarkable events that have transpired in Weaverville lately.

Write me all about the distinguished strangers who are now visiting Bucksport. I hope you may have a gay season, equal to Saratoga or Newport. I sat for my daguerreotype today and will send it to you the first opportunity, or by express.
