GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
On receipt of your letter of January 20, Mr. Jackson and 
myself waited on Lord Hillsborough, the new secretary of 
state for American affairs, and communicated to him the 
contents, pressing the necessity of enforcing the orders already 
sent to Sir William Johnson, for immediately settling the 
affair of the boundary line with the Indians. His Lordship 
was pleased to assure us, that he would cause duplicates of 
the orders to be forwarded by this packet, and urge the completion of them. 
</p><p>
We communicated also the copy of General Gage's letter, 
and the messages that had passed between the governor and 
the House thereupon. His Lordship acquainted us that a 
letter from Governor Penn had been shown him by the Proprietor, importing that a horrid murder had lately been committed on the Indians, upon which the governor had issued 
a proclamation for apprehending the murderer; and that a 
bill was under his and the Council's consideration to prevent future settlements on Indian lands. But his Lordship 
remarked, that these messages had not been communicated 
to him by the Proprietor. 
</p><p>
Government here begins to grow tired of the enormous 
expense of Indian affairs, and of maintaining posts in the 
Indian country ; and it is now talked of, as a proper measure, 
to abandon these posts, demolishing all but such as the colonies may think fit to keep up at their own expense ; and also 
to return the management of their own Indian affairs into the 
hands of the respective provinces as formerly. What the 
result will be, is uncertain, counsels here being so continually 
fluctuating. But I have urged often, that after taking those 
affairs out of our hands, it seems highly incumbent on the 
ministry not to neglect them, but to see that they are well 
managed and the Indians kept in peace. I think however 
that we should not too much depend on their doing this, but 
look to the matter a little ourselves, taking every opportunity 
of conciliating the affections of the Indians, by seeing that 
they always have justice done them, and sometimes kindness. 
For I can assure you, that here are not wanting people, who 
though not now in the ministry, no one knows how soon they 
may be; and if they were ministers, would take no step to 
prevent an Indian war in the colonies ; being of opinion, 
which they express openly, that it would be a very good thing, 
in the first place, to chastise the colonists for their undutifulness, and then to make them sensible of the necessity of protection by the troops of this country. 
</p><p>
Mr. Jackson, being now taken up with his election business, 
will hardly have time to write by this opportunity. But 
he joins with me in respects to you and the Assembly, and 
assurances of our most faithful services. I am, Gentlemen, 
your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
