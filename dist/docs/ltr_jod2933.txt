IT is now no longer a secret where Mr. Howe's fleet is. We have authentic intelligence that it is arrived 
at the head of Chesapeake bay, above the river Patapsco, upon which the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> stands. I 
wish I could describe to you the geography of this 
country, so as to give you an adequate idea of the situation of the two great bays of Chesapeake and Del 
aware, because it would enable you to form a conjecture concerning the object he aims at The distance across land from the heads of these bays is but 
small, and forms an isthmus, below which is a large 
peninsula, comprehending the counties of Accomac and Northampton in Virginia, the counties of Somerset and Worcester in Maryland, and the counties of 
Kent and Sussex in Delaware. His march by land to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> may be about sixty or seventy miles. 
I think there can be no doubt that he aims at this 
place, and he has taken this voyage of six weeks, long 
enough to have gone to London, merely to avoid an 
army in his rear. He found he could not march 
this way from Somerset court house without leaving 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> in his rear. We have called out 
the militia of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania, to oppose him, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> is handy enough to meet him ; and as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> saved <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> last winter by crossing the 
Delaware and marching to Morristown, and so getting in the rear of Howe, so, I conjecture, he will still find 
means to get in his rear between him and Chesapeake bay. You may now sit under your own vine and 
have none to make you afraid. I sent ofT my man and horse at an unlucky time, but if we should be obliged to remove from hence, we shall not go far.

If Congress had deliberated and debated a month, they could not have concerted a plan for Mr. Howe 
more to our advantage, than that which he has adopted. He gives us an opportunity of exerting the 
strength of all the middle States against him, while <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and New England are destroying Burgoyne. Now is the time ! never was so good an opportunity for my countrymen to turn out and crush that vaporing, blustering bully to atoms.
