THIS is St. George's day, a festival celebrated by the English, as St. Patrick's is by the Irish, St. David's 
by the Welsh, and St. Andrew's by the Scotch. The natives of Old England in this city, heretofore formed a society, which they called St. George's club or St. 
George's society. Upon the twenty-third of April, annually, they had a great feast. But the Tories and politics have made a schism in the society, so that one 
part of them are to meet and dine at the City Tavern, and the other nt the Bunch of Grapes Israel Jacobs's, and a third party go out of town. One set are 
stanch Americans, another stanch Britons, and a third, halfway men, neutral beings, moderate men, 
prudent, folks, for such is the division among men upon all occasions and every question. This is the account 
which I have from my barber, who is one of the society, and zealous on the side of America, and one of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Associators.

This curious character of a barber, I have a great inclination to draw, for your amusement. He is a little dapper fellow, short and small, but active and 
lively. A tongue as fluent and voluble as you please, wit at will, and a memory or an invention which never 
leaves him at a loss for a story to tell you for your entertainment. IT has seen great company. He has dressed hair and shaved faces at Bath, and at 
Court. He is acquainted with several of the nobility and gentry, particularly Sir William Meredith. He 
married a girl, the daughter of a Quaker in this place, of whom he tells many droll stories. He is a serjeant in one of the companies of some battalion or other 
here. He frequents, of evenings, a beer house kept by one Weaver in the city, where he has many curious disputes and adventures, and meets many odd characters.

I believe you will think me very idle to write you so trifling a letter, upon so uninteresting a subject, at a time when my country is fighting pro aris et focis. 
But I assure you I am glad to chat with this barber, while he is shaving and combing me, to divert myself from less agreeable thoughts. He is so sprightly and good humoured, that he contributes, more than I could have imagined, to my comfort in this life. Burne has prepared a string of toasts for the club to drink to-day at Israel's.
