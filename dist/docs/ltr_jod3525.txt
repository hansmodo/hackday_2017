A NEW commission has arrived by which the Dr. is 
sole minister. Mr. Lee continues commissioner for 
Spain, but I am reduced to the condition of a private 
citizen. The Congress have not taken the least notice 
of me. On the 11th of September they resolved to 
have one minister only in France. On the 14th they 
chose the Dr. In October they made out his com 
mission, the Alliance sailed on the 14th January, and 
in all that interval they never so much as bid me 
come home, bid me stay, or told me I had done well 
or done ill. Considering the accusation against Mr. Lee,how unexpected it was, and how groundless it 
is, I should not be at all surprised if I should see an 
accusation against me for something or other, I know 
not what, but I see that all things are possible.

Of all the scenes I ever passed through, this is the 
most extraordinary. The delirium among Ameri 
cans here is the most extravagant. All the infernal 
arts of stockjobbers, all the voracious avarice of 
merchants have mingled themselves with American 
politics here, disturbed their operations, distracted 
our councils, and turned our heads.

The Congress, I presume, expect that I should come 
home, and I shall come accordingly. As they have 
no business for me in Europe, I must contrive to get 
some for myself at home. Prepare yourself for re 
moving to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, into the old house, for there you 
shall go, and there I will draw writs and deeds, and 
harangue juries, and be happy.
