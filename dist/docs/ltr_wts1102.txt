My Dear Brother : I have seen by the papers that you 
are elected to Congress. I suppose you feel entitled to 
the congratulations of all the family, and I should not 
have been so late in giving you mine, only I expected that 
you would announce by letter the fact of your plans. To 
be elected is of course a higher honor than to occupy a 
seat in the House of Representatives ; yet that must be 
the school for those who are ambitious for higher honors. 
The Senate is, in my opinion, the only body which reflects 
an honor upon its members, and should you aspire to a 
seat there, I should be proud to learn of your success. 
As a young member I hope you will not be too forward, 
especially on the question of slavery, which it seems is 
rising more and more every year into a question of real 
danger, notwithstanding the compromises. Having lived 
a good deal in the South, I think I know practically more 
of slavery than you do. If it were a new question, no 
one now would contend for introducing it ; but it is an old 
and historical fact that you must take as you find it. 
There are certain lands in the South that cannot be 
inhabited in the summer by the whites, and yet the negro 
thrives in it this I know. Negroes free won't work 
tasks of course, and rice, sugar, and certain kinds of 
cotton cannot be produced except by forced negro labor. 
Slavery being a fact is chargeable on the past ; it cannot, 
by our system, be abolished except by force and consequent breaking up of our present government. As to 
restraining its further growth, the North have a perfect 
right to their full vote, and should, as a matter of course, 
use it. The Nebraska bill was a mistake on the part of 
the South, a vital mistake that will do them more harm 
than all the violent abolitionists in the country. Let 
slavery extend along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, 
but not in the high salubrious prairies of the West. It 
was a mistake to make Missouri a slave State ; but it was 
done long ago, and now there is no remedy except in the 
State itself. Slavery can never exist here or north of 
us, so the North now has the power and can exercise it 
in prudence and moderation. Of all the follies of our 
government, that of the purchase of the Ladslen line 
excelled any, the land embraced in that line would not 
sell at auction for a thousand dollars, and yet it cost ten 
millions. My idea is to leave our present limits alone 
until we have more population, and then to make other 
adjacent territories pay for coming into the Union. The 
Sandwich Islands and Cuba, as long as held by Spain, or 
are independent, are more useful to us than if annexed as 
territory. If we had a colonial system like England, 
whereby we could govern them absolutely, it would be 
good property, but to admit the Kanakas of the Pacific 
and mixed Creoles of Cuba on a par with ourselves, would 
not exalt them, but would degrade us. ...

Your affectionate brother,
