MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE House yesterday passed a resolution in committee of the whole, whose depth is to me unfathomable. The Senate will now be called upon to show 
their independence, and perhaps your friend to show 
his weakness or his strength. The majority of the 
House is certainly for mischief, and there is no doubt 
they represent the people in the southern States and 
a large number in the northern. Vox populi, vox Dei, they say, and so it is, sometimes ; but it is some 
times the voice of Mahomet, of Caesar, of Catiline, 
the Pope and the Devil. Britain, however, has done 
much amiss, and deserves all that will fall thereon. 
Her insolence, which you and I have known and felt 
more than any other Americans, will lead her to ruin 
and us half way. We, indeed, are, in point of insolence, her very image and superscription, as true a 
game cock as she, and I warrant you, shall become 
as great a scourge to mankind. 
</p><p>
Our furniture has had its last removal. Your distress and distraction at its landing are very strongly 
described. Whatever crashes have happened shall 
be the last from removals. My countrymen are 
going into a career that I shall not long follow. I 
don t expect another election, if I should, peradventure, ride out the remainder of my term. I long 
to see you, but I fear it will be late in May if not the 
beginning of June. 
</p><p>
I am, with ardent gratitude and affection, 
</p><p>
Your 
</p><p>
