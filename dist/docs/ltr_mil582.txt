New Orleans - April 21st
</p><p>
Dearest Emily!
</p><p>
I know you have been abusing me, & I deserve it. But you must forgive me. I have been such a gay society lady, that my time has been engrossed with the pomps & vanities, & then I knew I would soon see you, & tell you all about everything. I leave Saturday - day after tomorrow, & go direct to Rob - so write to me there - “West Point. King William Co Va.” In the calm & stillness of the country I will have time to meditate on the follies of the past winter! I paid Evy Tucker a visit of a week in Natchez - & had a charming time - but you have read of my triumphs in the papers? Evy is very happy, & has married into a lovely family. I wrote to Mr Harrison, & told him to shew you my letter - so you have not been in the dark as to my doings as of late. I shall be so glad to get home, & to cool weather, here it is now as hot as our July days - & my summer clothes are in Lexington! And I dare not face to turn to do any shopping, besides I hate it so. That unless compelled, I never enter a shop. I may not reach home until after commencement - I would cross the ocean to avoid it - the only thing is that I may help Custis by being there. But for that I should go to the cool and shade of Ravensworth, till that horrible time is over. What have you been doing all this winter? How I wish you could have gone away somewhere. Today I am going to the races, (with a married man!) & afterwards dine with his wife - I have also a lot of farewell visits to pay - so I must be brief -

My love to Nat, & to every body who cares for me. I weigh 137 pounds! Have no new clothes at all - been wearing out my old ones! No beaux - no admirers - nothing - I mean in particular . How is the ivy on the chapel? Ask Mrs Lea please to plant some on the church.

Ever devotedly-
