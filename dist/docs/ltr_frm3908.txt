SIR: 
</p><p>
Enclosed is a return of the companies which are to do duty in George 
town. Warden's and Long's will be sent to you. I also send you the 
militia laws. The Governor wrote you that Commodore Gillon has 
carried in five Jamaica prizes in the Havanna, worth 150,000 dollars. 
Two of the prizes are expected in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, and the Governor desires 
the pilot to keep a good look out for them. Several of your men wish 
to enlist in the infantry, on the new bounty. Such as have but two 
months to serve in your corps, may be discharged, on condition of 
enlisting for three years, or during the war. I send two men, with their 
attestations, which cannot be sworn to until your discharge is obtained, 
which please see done, and give them the enclosed orders to Swinton 
for their negroes, and grant them one month furlough. Mr. Shrewsberry will wait on you he is a shipwright, and may be useful; but he 
must be watched, for he has been, and is, much suspected. He will 
want to send a boat to Dewees Island for some goods, osnaburgs and 
Russian drab, which is for our soldiers. You will please give him a 
pass for that boat, and receive the goods; but he must not be suffered 
to go out of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. I will send fifty stand of arms, and pouches 
with ammunition. Col. Moultrie will want some of them, and you are 
to take what he may not want at present, until I get more from Gen 
Greene. 
</p><p>
I am, your obedient servant,
