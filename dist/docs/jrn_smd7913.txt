A note just came from mother, telling me that the 
most awful Yankees were coming to burn Linwood 
and take Port Hudson, and so this evening I must 
walk down to the cars with a chair to rest in until 
they came, and must certainly be in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> to-night. 
Delightful arrangement ! I wrote to ask if she knew 
that my legs were of no more service to me than to 
her? Dr. Dortch has again been murdering me . . . 
says perhaps I can stand by Sunday. If the Yankees 
come before
