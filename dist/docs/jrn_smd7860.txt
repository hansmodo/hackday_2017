Last night, shortly after we got in bed, we were roused by loud cannonading towards <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, 
and running out on the small balcony up here, saw the light of a great fire in that direction. From the 
constant reports, and the explosion of what seemed to be several powder magazines, we imagined it to 
be either the Garrison or a gunboat. Whatever it was, it was certainly a great fire. We all ran out in 
our nightgowns, and watched for an hour in the damp air, I without even shoes. We listened to the 
fight a long while, until the sound ceased, and we went back to bed.

Evening. 
</p><p>
I am so disheartened ! I have been listening with the others to a man who was telling us about <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, until I am heartsick. He says the Yankees 
have been largely reinforced, and are prepared for another attack which will probably take place tomorrow; that the fight was a dreadful one, we driving them in, and losing twelve hundred, to their fifteen hundred. It must have been awful ! And that our troops have resolved to burn the town down, since they cannot hold it under the fire of the gun boats.
