Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to address your Excellency the 
8th instant, giving you a detail of what has passed 
down to that date. The enemy, lying still at Westover on the 9th, and some vessels which had lain at 
the mouth of the Appamatox, dropping down that 
day to their fleet, I thought it evident they had no 
design against Petersburg, and therefore ordered the 
few militia who were assembled there to march to 
Prince George Court-House, and went there myself, 
that I might be more at hand, to prepare against 
any movement of the enemy. The 10th, in the 
morning, I was informed they were embarking their 
troops; and, on reconnoitring them myself, from Coggin's Point, I found their embarkation completed, and 
the vessels preparing to sail. 
It had been found impracticable to remount the 
cannon at Hood's or to prepare any obstruction to 
their passing that place. Of this, however, the enemy 
were ignorant ; and, thinking it very probable they 
would land a party to examine those works before 
they attempted to pass, I ordered three hundred infantry and about thirty horse, under Colonel Clark, 
to lie in ambush to receive them. About 12 o'clock 
the fleet got under way, and at 4 o'clock I saw 
them, from Hood's, come to, within cannon-shot. At 
dark they landed troops from eighteen boats, deserters (say five hundred), who immediately attacked a 
small picket we had, and pursued them to within 
forty paces of the ambuscade, when our troops gave 
them a fire ; but, on their returning it, and charging 
bayonets, the militia immediately fled. After throwing the cannon into the river, the enemy returned to 
their ships, which, at daylight, were five miles below. 
I ordered three hundred infantry and two troops of 
horse down to Cabin Point, and encamped with the 
remainder, about five hundred men, at this place. As 
an attempt might be made at <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, and as 
General Nelson had only four hundred men, I ordered 
five hundred and sixty militia, who were then on 
their way to join me, to cross the river and reenforce 
him. The next great object for the enemy being 
Hunter's Works, and the stores at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, I 
wrote the Governor to countermand the militia from 
that quarter. General Weedon had already advanced 
with about three hundred and fifty, as far as Hanover Court-House, before he received the Governor's 
letter. It is left with him to return or not, according as he, from his knowledge of the force that can 
be collected, may think necessary. 
</p><p>
I cannot yet form any judgment of the future operations of the enemy. Should the}'- mean to pillage 
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, Nelson's corps may harass, but cannot 
prevent them. If they take possession of Norfolk, I shall collect what force is necessary, and endeavour to 
keep them engaged. Or, if they should go into Potomac, I shall immediately march to form a junction 
with the militia under General Weedon, and cover <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>. 
</p><p>
The militia are coming in from all quarters, but 
without arms, for which they apply to me. I have 
delivered about five hundred we had, belonging to 
the Continent. Those of the State were so scattered, 
in removing them on the alarm, that their officers 
cannot collect them again. The troops have neither 
tents nor camp-kettles. It is impossible to describe 
the situation I am in, in want of every thing ; and 
nothing can be got from the State, rather for want 
of arrangement than any thing else. I am, with the 
greatest respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant,
