Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I shall confine myself, on the present occasion, to transmitting copies of my correspondence with the ministry, on the 
subject of the conference mentioned to you in mine of the thirtieth of last month. I transmit, however, a copy of what I 
wrote on the twentieth of August, because the answer of the 
eighth of this month would not be otherwise intelligible. I 
will not at present make any comments on this correspondence, 
and I do not know whether I shall ever mention it again. 
I send you also, as the best means of communicating the 
state of this city and kingdom, the short but lively picture drawn 
of them in the Assembly by Monsieur Masuyer, on Saturday 
last, the fifteenth instant, and the report made on Sunday morn 
ing, by Monsieur Roland, the minister of the Interior. 
</p><p>
I wish it were in my power to communicate a more flattering prospect, than is held out by these extracts. It gives me 
pain to write, and will, I am sure, give you pain to read, the 
distressful state of a country for which we have both a sincere 
regard. All which I can do under present circumstances, is, 
to be silent. Bad news have a flight so rapid, that I will not 
add to their wings.
