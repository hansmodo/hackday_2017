Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It gave me very sincere pleasure to learn from you the 
good tidings, which you communicate respecting our new form 
of government. I know that you are not liable to the dupery 
of false hopes and groundless expectations ; and therefore I 
am confirmed in the opinion I have invariably entertained, that 
the new constitution is such a plain, calm, sensible appeal to 
the interest, feelings, and common sense of our countrymen, 
that it must, by its own intrinsic weight, bear down all opposition. I have from time to time received very great pleasure, 
at the developement of its principles by the legislature, which 
in my opinion does them the greatest honor. They have 
far, very far outgone my expectations, and even come up, not 
only to my hopes, but to my very wishes. 
</p><p>
I have not unfrequently brought myself to share in the plea 
sure you must feel, in the consciousness of your own useful 
agency. Certainly it is the sublimest sentiment of the human 
heart, to know that we make others happy ; and more especially those whom we love. You have too much good sense 
not to know, that no person but yourself could have obtained 
that full confidence needful to the due establishment of the executive authority, which certainly is the key-stone in the great 
arch of empire. I doubt, also, whether any other could so 
universally have called forth into action the talents and virtues 
of America. Let me add, what I have mentioned to you on 
other occasions, and which I would not have mentioned, 
did I not know it to be true, your knowledge of human 
character is a gift inestimable to our country on the present 
occasion. I hope in God, my dear Sir, that you may long 
continue to preside, and that not only you, but all who succeed you, may be assisted by counsellors as able and as honest, as those who now fill the different seats in Congress. 
The prospect of public felicity, which must be the result, 
swells my bosom with delight. Oh my country, how happy r 
didst thou but know thine own blessedness. 
</p><p>
Your sentiments on the revolution effecting here, T believe 
to be perfectly just, because they perfectly accord with my 
own, and that is, you know, the only standard which Heaven 
has given us by which to judge. The king is in effect a pris 
oner at Paris, and obeys entirely the National Assembly. This 
assembly may be divided into three parts; one, called the 
Aristocrats, consists of the high clergy, the members of the 
law, (note, these are not the lawyers,) and such of the nobility as think they ought to form a separate order. Another, 
which has no name, but which consists of all sorts of people, 
really friends to a good free government. The third is com 
posed of what is called here the Enrages, that is, the mad 
men. These are the most numerous, and are of that class 
which in America is known by the name of pettifogging lawyers; together with a host of curates, and many of those per 
sons who, in all revolutions, throng to the standard of change, 
because they are not well. 
This last party is in close alliance with the populace here, 
and derives from that circumstance very great authority. 
They have already unhinged everything, and according to custom on such occasions the torrent rushes on irresistible, until 
it shall have wasted itself. The Aristocrats are without a leader, and without any plan or councils as yet, but ready to throw 
themselves into the arms of any one who shall offer. The 
middle party, who mean well, have unfortunately acquired 
their ideas of government from books, and are admirable fellows upon paper ; but as it happens, somewhat unfortunately, 
that the men who live in the world are very different from those 
who dwell in the heads of philosophers, it is not to be wondered at, if the systems taken out of books are fit for nothing but 
to be put into books again. 
</p><p>
Marmontel is the only man I have met with, among their 
Literati, who seems truly to understand the subject. For the 
rest, they discuss nothing in their Assembly. One large half 
of the time is spent in hallooing and bawling. The manner 
of speaking to a question is as follows. Such as intend to 
hold forth write their names on a tablet kept for that purpose, 
and are heard in the order that their names are written down, 
if the others will hear them, which very often they refuse to 
do, but keep up a continual uproar till the orator leaves the 
pulpit. Each man permitted to speak delivers the result of 
his lucubrations, so that the opposing parties fire off their cartridges, and it is a million to one if their missile arguments 
happen to meet. As to the arguments themselves, you will 
observe that it is a usual compliment of the Assembly to order 
them printed ; therefore, there is as much attention paid, at 
least, to make them sound well and look well, as to convey 
instruction or produce conviction, 
</p><p>
But there is another ceremony which the arguments go 
through, and which does not fail to affect the form, at least, 
and perhaps the substance. They are read beforehand in a 
small society of young men and women, and generally the fair 
friend of the speaker is one, or else the fair whom he means to 
make his friend, and the society very politely give their approbation, unless the lady who gives the tone to that circle chances to reprehend something, which is of course altered if not 
amended. Do not suppose that I am playing the traveller. I 
have assisted at some of these readings, and will now give you 
an anecdote from one of them. It was at Madame de Stael s, 
the daughter of M. Necker. She is a woman of wonderful 
wit, and above vulgar prejudices of every kind. Her house is 
a kind of temple of Apollo, where the men of wit and fashion 
are collected twice a week at supper, and once at dinner, and 
sometimes more frequently. The Count de Clermont-Tonnerre, one of their greatest orators, read to us a very pathetic 
oration, and the object was to show that no penalties are the 
legal compensations for injuries and crimes ; the man who is 
hanged, having by that event paid his debt to the society, ought 
not to be held in dishonor ; and in like manner, he who has 
been condemned for seven years to be flogged in the gallies 
should, when he had served out his apprenticeship, be received again into good company as if nothing had happened. You 
smile ; but observe the extreme to which the matter was carried the other way. Dishonoring thousands for the guilt of 
one has so shocked the public sentiment, as to render this extreme fashionable. The oration was very fine, very sentimental, very pathetic, and the style harmonious. Shouts of applause and full approbation. 
</p><p>
When this was pretty well over, I told him that his speech 
was extremely eloquent, but that his principles were not very 
solid. Universal surprise ! A very few remarks changed the 
face of things. The position was universally condemned, and 
he left the room. I need not add, that as yet it has never been 
delivered in the assembly. And yet it was of the kind, which 
produces a decree by acclamation ; for sometimes an orator 
gets up in the midst of another deliberation, makes a fine dis 
course, and closes with a good snug resolution which is carried 
with a huzza. Thus, in considering a plan for a national bank 
proposed by M. Necker, one of them took it into his head to 
move, that every member should give his silver buckles, which 
was agreed to at once, and the honorable mover laid his upon 
the table, after which the business went on again. 
</p><p>
It is very difficult to guess whereabouts the flock will settle, 
when it flies so wild ; but as far as it is possible to guess, at 
present, this (late) kingdom will be cast into a congeries of 
little democracies, laid out, not according to the rivers, mountains, &c. but with the square and compass, according to latitude and longitude ; and as the provinces had anciently different laws called coutumes, and as the clippings and parings of 
several different provinces must fall together within some of 
the new divisions, I think such fermenting matter must give 
them a kind of political cholic. Their ,/lssembUe Nationale 
will be something like the Old Congress, and the King will be 
catted executive magistrate. As yet they have been busily en 
gaged in pillaging the present occupant of his authority ; how 
much they will leave him, will depend upon the chapter of accidents. I believe it will be very little ; but little or much, the 
perspective of such a King, and such an Assembly, brings to 
my mind a saying which Shakspeare has put into the mouth of 
an old soldier, upon hearing that Lepidus, one of the famous 
Triumvirate, was dead. c So, the poor third is up. World, 
thou hast but a pair of chops, and throw between them all the 
food thou may st, they needs must grind each other. 
</p><p>
At present the people are fully determined to support the 
Assembly ; and although there are some discontents, I do not 
believe that anything very serious, as yet, exists in the style of 
opposition. Indeed, it would be wonderful if there should ; 
for hitherto an extension of privileges, and a remission of taxes 
to the lower class, have marked every stage of their progress. 
Besides, the love of novelty is a great sweetener in revolutions. 
But the time will come when this novelty will be over and all 
its charms gone. In lieu of the taxes remitted, other taxes 
must be laid, for the public burthen must be borne. The 
elected administrators must, then, either indulge their electors, 
which will be ruinous to the Fisc, or in urging the collection of taxes, displace their constituents. In all probability, there will 
be a little of both. Hence must arise bickerings and heart 
burnings among the different districts, and a great languor 
throughout the kingdom. As the revenue must fall short of calculation in point of time, if not in amount, (and that is the 
same thing where revenue is concerned,) it will follow, that 
either the interest of the public debt will not be regularly paid, 
or that the various departments will be starved ; probably a 
little of both. Hence will result a loss of public credit, and 
therewith much injury to commerce and manufactures, operating a farther decrease of the means of revenue, and much debility as to the exterior operations of the kingdom. 
</p><p>
At this moment the discontented spirits will find congenial 
matter in abundance to work upon ; and from that period, 
all the future is involved in the mist of conjecture. If the 
reigning prince were not the small beer character that he is, 
there can be but little doubt, that watching events, and making 
a tolerable use of them, he would regain his authority ; but 
what will you have from a creature who, situated as he is, eats, 
and drinks, and sleeps well, and laughs, and is as merry a 
grig as lives ? The idea that they will give him some money, 
which he, can economize, and that he will have no trouble in 
governing, contents him entirely. Poor man ! he little thinks 
how unstable is his situation. He is beloved, but it is not with 
the sort of love which a monarch should inspire. It is that 
kind of good natured pity, which one feels for a led captive. 
There is, besides, no possibility of serving him ; for at the 
slightest show of opposition, he gives up everything and every 
person. 
</p><p>
As to his ministers, the Count de Montmorin has more 
understanding than people in general imagine, and he means 
well, very well. But he means it feebly. He is a good 
easy kind of man, one who would make an excellent peace 
minister in quiet times ; but he wants the vigor of mind needful for great occasions. The Count de la Luzerne is an 
indolent, pleasant companion, a man of honor, and as obstinate as you please ; but he has somewhat of the creed of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel=''>General Gates</a>, that the world does a great part of its own 
business, without the aid of those who are at the head of 
affairs. The success of such men depends very much upon 
the run of the dice. The Count de St Priest is the only man 
among them, who has what they call caractere, which answers 
to our idea of firmness, joined to some activity. But a person 
who knows him pretty well, (which I do not,) assures me, that 
he is mercenary and false hearted. If so, he cannot possess 
much good sense, whatever may be his share of genius or 
talents. Monsieur de Latour-Dupin, the minister at war, 
whom I am also unacquainted with, is said to be no great 
things in any respect. M. Necker was frightened by the 
Enrages into the acceptance of him, instead of the Marquis de Montesquiou, who has a considerable share of talents, and 
a great deal of method. Montesquiou is of course at present the enemy of M. Necker, having been his friend. 
</p><p>
As to M. Necker, he is one of those people, who has obtained a much greater reputation than he had any right to. 
His enemies say, that as a banker, he acquired his fortune by 
means, which to say the least were indelicate, and they 
mention instances. But in this country, everything is so 
much exaggerated, that nothing is more useful than a little 
skepticism. M. Necker, in his public administration, has 
always been honest and disinterested ; which proves well, I 
think, for his former private conduct ; or else it proves that 
he has more vanity than cupidity. Be that as it may, an 
unspotted integrity as minister, and serving at his own expense, 
in an office which others seek for the purpose of enriching 
themselves, have acquired for him very deservedly much confi 
dence. Add to this, that his writings on finance teem with 
that sort of sensibility, whiah make? the fortune of modern 
romances, and which is exactly suited to this lively nation, 
who love to read but hate to think. Hence his reputation. 
He is a man of genius, and his wife is a woman of sense ; but 
neither of them have talents, or rather the talents of a great 
minister. His education as a banker has taught him to make 
tight bargains, and put him upon his guard against projects. 
But though he understands man, as a covetous creature, he 
does not understand mankind ; a defect which is remediless. 
He is utterly ignorant of politics, by which I mean politics in 
the great sense, or that sublime science, which embraces for 
its object the happiness of mankind. Consequently, he neither knows what constitution to form, nor how to obtain the 
consent of others to such as he wishes. From the moment 
of convening the States-General, he has been afloat upon the 
wide ocean of incidents. 
</p><p>
But what is most extraordinary is, that M. Necker is a very 
poor financier. This, I know, will sound like heresy in the 
ears of most people, but it is true. The plans he has pro 
posed are feeble and inept. Hitherto he has been supported 
by borrowing from the Caisse d Escompte, which, (being by 
means of what they call here an arret de surseance secured 
from all prosecutions,) has lent him a sum in their paper 
exceeding the totality of their capital, by about four millions 
sterling. Last autumn he came forward to the Assembles with 
a dreadful tale of woe, at the fag end of which was a tax 
upon every member of the community of a fourth of his revenue, and this he declared to be needful for saving the state. 
His enemies adopted it, (declaring what is very true, that it is 
a wretched, impracticable expedient,) in the hope that he 
and his scheme would fall together. This Assemblee, this 
patriotic band, took in the lump the minister's proposition, 
because of their confidence and the confidence of the people 
in him as they said ; but in fact, because they would not risk 
the unpopularity of a tax. 
</p><p>
The plan thus adopted, M. Necker, to escape the snare 
which he had nearly got taken in, altered his tax into what 
they call the patriotic contribution. By this, every man is to 
declare, if he pleases, at what he pleases to estimate his annual 
income, and to pay one fourth of it in three years. You will 
easily suppose that this fund was unproductive, and notwithstanding the imminent danger of the state, we are as yet without 
any aid from the contribution patriotique. 
</p><p>
His next scheme was that of a National Bank, or at least 
an extension of the Caisse d Escompte. It has been variously 
modelled since, and many capital objections removed ; but at 
last it is good for nothing, and so it will turn out. At present 
it is just beginning. By way of giving some base to the pre 
sent operation, it is proposed and determined to sell about ten 
or twelve millions sterling of the crown and church lands, both 
of which are, by resolution of the Assemblee, declared to belong 
to the nation ; but as it is clear that these lands will not sell 
well just now, they have appointed a treasurer to receive what 
they will sell for hereafter, and they issue a kind of order upon 
this treasurer, which is to be called an Assignat, and is to be 
paid, (out of these sales) one, two, and three years hence. 
They expect that on these Jlssignais they can borrow money 
to free the engagements of the Caisse d Escompte, and they are 
at the same time to pay some of the more pressing debts, with 
the same Assignats. 
</p><p>
Now this plan must fail, as follows. First, there will be some 
doubt about the title to these lands, at least till the revolution 
is completed. Secondly, the representative of the land must 
always (for a reason which will presently appear) sell for less 
than a representative of money, and therefore, until public 
confidence is so far restored as that the five per cents are 
above par, these Assignats bearing five per cent must be be 
low par. Money, therefore, cannot be raised upon them but 
at a considerable discount. Thirdly, the lands to be disposed 
of must sell a great deal below their value, for there is not 
money to buy them in this country; and the proof is, that they 
never obtained money on loan at the legal interest but always 
upon a premium sufficient to draw it from the employments of 
commerce and manufactures, and as the revolution has greatly 
lessened the mass of money, the effect of the scarcity must be 
greater. 
</p><p>
But farther, there is a solecism in the plan which escapes 
most of them, and which is, nevertheless, very palpable. The 
value of lands in Europe is, you know, estimated by the in 
come. To dispose of public lands is to sell public revenue ; 
and therefore taking the legal interest at five per cent, lands 
renting for 100 livres ought to sell for <a href='/results.php?year=2000'>2000</a>, but they expect 
that these lands will sell for <a href='/results.php?year=3000'>3000</a>, and that thereby, not only 
public credit will be restored, but a great saving will be made, 
as the <a href='/results.php?year=3000'>3000</a> will redeem an interest of 150. It is, however, 
an indisputable fact, that public credit being established, the 
stocks are worth more than land of equal income, and for three 
reasons ; first, that there is no trouble whatever in the management ; secondly, there is no danger of bad crops and taxes ; 
and thirdly, they can be disposed of at a moment's warning, 
if the owner wants money, and be as readily repurchased when 
it suits his convenience. If, therefore, the public credit be re 
stored, and there be a surplus sum of ten to twelve millions to 
be invested, and if such large sales (contrary to custom) should 
not from the amount affect the price, still the lands must go 
cheaper than the stocks, and consequently the interest bought 
will be smaller than the revenue sold. 
</p><p>
Having thus given you a very rude sketch of the men and 
the measures of this country, I see and feel that it is time to 
conclude. I sincerely wish I could say that there are able 
men at hand to take the helm, should the present pilots aban 
don the ship. But I have great apprehensions as to those who 
may succeed. The present set must wear out in the course of 
the year, and most of them would be glad to get fairly out of 
the scrape at present ; but it is alike dangerous to stay or to 
go, and they must patiently wait the breath of the Assembles and 
follow as it blows. The new order of things cannot endure. 
I hope it may be mended, but fear it may be changed. All 
Europe, just now, is like a mine ready to explode ; and if 
this winter does not produce peace, next summer will behold 
a wider extension of the war. I am, &c.
