<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='5'>5th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. A heavy, heavy heart. Another missive from Jordan, querulous and fault-finding; things are all 
wrong <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard's</a> Jordan had been crossed, not the stream " in Canaan's fair and happy land, where our possessions lie. They seem to feel that the war is over here, except the President and Mr. Barnwell ; above all that foreboding friend of mine, Captain Ingraham. He thinks it hardly begun.

Another outburst from Jordan. <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> is not seconded properly. Helas! To think that any mortal General (even though he had sprung up in a month or so from captain of artillery to general) could be so puffed up with 
vanity, so blinded by any false idea of his own consequence as to write, to intimate that man, or men, would sacrifice 
their country, injure themselves, ruin their families, to spite the aforesaid general ! Conceit and self-assertion can 
never reach a higher point than that. And yet they give you to understand <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> does riot like <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a>. In 
point of fact they fancy he is jealous of him, and rather than <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> shall have a showing the President (who 
would be hanged at least if things go wrong) will cripple the army to spite <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a>. Mr. Mallory says, "How 
we could laugh, but you see it is no laughing matter to have our fate in the hands of such self-sufficient, vain, army 
idiots." So the amenities of life are spreading.

In the meantime we seem to be resting on our oars, debating in Congress, while the enterprising Yankees are 
quadrupling their army at their leisure. Every day some of our regiments march away from here. The town is 
crowded with soldiers. These new ones are fairly running in ; fearing the war will be over before they get a sight of 
the fun. Every man from every little precinct wants a place in the picture.

Tuesday. The North requires 600,000 men to invade us. Truly we are a formidable power! The Herald says it is 
useless to move with a man less than that. England has made it all up with them, or rather, she will not break with them. 
Jerome Napoleon is in Washington and not our friend.

Doctor Gibbes is a bird of ill omen. To-day he tells me eight of our men have died at the Charlottesville Hospital. 
It seems sickness is more redoubtable in an army than the enemy's guns. There are 1,100 there liors de combat, and 
typhoid fever is with them. They want money, clothes, and nurses. So, as I am writing, right and left the letters 
fly, calling for help from the sister societies at home. Good and patriotic women at home are easily stirred to their work.

Mary Hammy has many strings to her bow a fiance in the army, and Doctor Berrien in town. To-day she drove 
out with Major Smith and Colonel Hood. Yesterday, Custis Lee was here. She is a prudent little puss and needs no 
good advice, if I were one to give it.

Lawrence does all our shopping. All his master's money 
has been in his hands until now. I thought it injudicious when gold is at such a premium to leave it lying loose in 
the tray of a trunk. So I have sewed it up in a belt, which I can wear upon an emergency. The cloth is wadded and 
my diamonds are there, too. It has strong strings, and can be tied under my hoops about my waist if the worst comes 
to the worst, as the saying is. Lawrence wears the same bronze mask. No sign of anything he may feel or think of 
my latest fancy. Only, I know he asks for twice as much money now when he goes to buy things.
