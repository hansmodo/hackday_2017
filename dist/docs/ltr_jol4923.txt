My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The more I reflect upon the difficulties and delays 
which are likely to attend the completing our Continental regiments, the more anxiously is my mind bent 
upon the scheme, which I lately communicated to you. 
The obstacles to the execution of it had presented 
themselves to me, but by no means appeared insurmountable. I was aware of having that monstrous 
popular prejudice, open-mouthed against me, of under 
taking to transform beings almost irrational, into well 
disciplined soldiers, of being obliged to combat the 
arguments, and perhaps the intrigues, of interested 
persons. But zeal for the public service, and an ardent 
desire to assert the rights of humanity, determined me 
to engage in this arduous business, with the sanction 
of your consent. My own perseverance, aided by the 
countenance of a few virtuous men, will, I hope, 
enable me to accomplish it. 
</p><p>
You seem to think, my dear father, that men reconciled by long habit to the miseries of their condition, 
would prefer their ignominious bonds to the untasted 
sweets of liberty, especially when offer'd upon the 
terms which I propose. 
</p><p>
I confess, indeed, that the minds of this unhappy 
species must be debased by a servitude, from which 
they can hope for no relief but death, and that every 
motive to action but fear, must be nearly extinguished 
in them. But do you think they are so perfectly 
moulded to their state as to be insensible that a better 
exists ? Will the galling comparison between them 
selves and their masters leave them unenlightened in 
this respect ? Can their self love be so totally annihilated as not frequently to induce ardent wishes for a change ? 
</p><p>
You will accuse me, perhaps, my dearest friend, of 
consulting my own feelings too much; but I am 
tempted to believe that this trampled people have so 
much human left in them, as to be capable of aspiring 
to the rights of men by noble exertions, if some friend 
to mankind would point the road, and give them a 
prospect of success. If I am mistaken in this, I would 
avail myself, even of their weakness, and, conquering 
one fear by another, produce equal good to the public. 
You will ask in this view, how do you consult the 
benefit of the slaves ? I answer, that like other men, 
they are the creatures of habit. Their cowardly ideas 
will be gradually effaced, and they will be modified 
anew. Their being rescued from a state of perpetual 
humiliation, and being advanced, as it were, in the 
scale of being, will compensate the dangers incident 
to their new state. 
</p><p>
The hope that will spring in each man's mind, 
respecting his own escape, will prevent his being 
miserable. Those who fall in battle will not lose 
much ; those who survive will obtain their reward. 
Habits of subordination, patience under fatigues, sufferings and privations of every kind, are soldierly 
qualifications, which these men possess in an eminent 
degree. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, my dearest friend and father, I 
hope that my plan for serving my country and the 
oppressed negro race will not appear to you the chimera of a young mind, deceived by a false appearance 
of moral beauty, but a laudable sacrifice of private 
interest, to justice and the public good. 
You say, that my resources would be small, on 
account of the proportion of women and children. 
I do not know whether I am right, for I speak from 
impulse, and have not reasoned upon the matter. I 
say, altho my plan is at once to give freedom to the 
negroes, and gain soldiers to the states ; in case of 
concurrence, I sh'd sacrifice the former interest, and 
therefore w'd change the women and children for able bodied men. The more of these I could obtain, the 
better ; but forty might be a good foundation to begin 
upon. 
</p><p>
It is a pity that some such plan as I propose could 
not be more extensively executed by public authority. 
A well chosen body of 5,000 black men, properly officer d, to act as light troops, in addition to our present 
establishment, might give us decisive success in the 
next campaign. 
</p><p>
1 have long deplored the wretched state of these 
men, and considered in their history, the bloody wars 
excited in Africa, to furnish America with slaves 
the groans of despairing multitudes, toiling for the 
luxuries of merciless tyrants. 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of conversing with you, 
sometimes, upon the means of restoring them to their 
rights. When can it be better done, than when their 
enfranchisement may be made conducive to the pub 
lic good, and be modified, as not to overpower their 
weak minds? 
</p><p>
You ask, what is the general's opinion, upon this 
</p><p>
subject ? He is convinced, that the numerous tribes 
of blacks in the southern parts of the continent., offer 
a resource to us that should not be neglected. With 
respect to my particular plan, he only objects to it, 
with the arguments of pity for a man who would be 
less rich than he might be. 
</p><p>
I am obliged, my dearest friend and father, to take 
my leave for the present ; you will excuse whatever 
exceptionable may have escaped in the course of my 
letter, and accept the assurance of filial love, and 
</p><p>
respect of 
</p><p>
Your
