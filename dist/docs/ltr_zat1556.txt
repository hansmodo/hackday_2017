My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 2y th ult was this moment rec d communicating 
the distressing intelligence of the death of your brother, on which sad 
occasion most truly & sincerely do I feel for, & sympathize with you all, 
particularly with his wife, & children, & your aged & excellent mother 
on this trying occasion, which I greatly fear the latter will hardly be able 
to bear up under; had he died with his family & friends around him, 
however sad it would have been to those near & dear to him, yet it 
would have been a source no doubt of great consolation to them all, to 
have been around him in his last moments, to have closed his eyes, 
rec d his parting blessings & long farewell ; as you correctly say there are 
other places where death revels among the brave & good besides the 
battle field ; but we should all find consolation that it is a debt we all 
have to pay, that a few years will again bring us all together in an other 
& better world ; & it is well for us to believe that he who controls all 
things, does nothing without motive, & we ought to hope it was for the 
best, which I trust is the case in the present instance ; notwithstanding 
the sorrow & I may say deep affliction it has occasioned ; also that the 
winds will be tempered to the shorn lamb in reality in this instance. I 
very much regret your absence from the North at this time, so that you 
could have at once visited your mother & the other members of your 
family, & besides offering them every consolation, aided in getting them 
comfortably located before leaving them. On hearing from them again 
it should be deemed necessary for their comfort & interest that you 
should make them a visit, as well as for your own, you ought not to hesitate in doing so, even if you have to return. I will not hesitate to give 
you a short leave of absence for that object, whenever you think proper 
to apply. I hope if the Ohio is navigable Ann & the children have 
reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> in safety by this time, as I hope her stay will be very 
limited in Cincinnati or any where else after she leaves <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> Majr 
James Graham of the Topographical corps, reached here on the second 
at night being the bearer of despatches growing out of mine carried by 
Cap Eaton to Washington announcing the taking of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> The 
principal matter contained in the same, was to put an end to the cessation 
of arms entered into with the Mexican Gen in chief, by the orders of the 
president it would cease on the 13th  instead of the 19t when it would 
have expired as a matter of course by limitation in a few days ; my conduct 
is in the main approved with complimentary notice of my self & the com 
mand, yet it is evident a very cold one, which would have been avoided 
if it could have been done with safety ; their orders for me to put an end 
to the cessation of arms, & to carry on my operations with renewed 
vigor against the enemy is evidence enough of their feeling towards me 
at Washington, which they only want a decent pretext to show openly ; 
there is I hear from high authority an intrigue going on against me ; the 
object of which is to deprive me of the command ; my only sin for this 
is the want of discression on the part of certain politicians, in connecting 
my name as a proper candidate for the next presidential election ; which 
I very much regretted, for even admitting I aspired to that high office for 
which I have not the most distant intention of doing, this is no time for 
agitating that question, it will be time enough to do so in 1 848 A 
mail has this moment arrived with a train & brought me your letter of 
the 22 d inclosing one from Betty, & accompanied by several n. papers 
with interesting extracts taken or cut from other papers, for which I sin 
cerely thank you & it is truly gratifying to me to know that Ann & the 
children will spend the winter with her mother at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a>, where I am 
in hopes they now are as it will be equally so to Mrs T. Betty writes 
me Oct r 1 2 th in which she says " We rec d yesterday a letter from Sister 
Ann dated the 22 d of the last month in which she says she would leave 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> in about two weeks for this place, but would stop some days at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, so that we calculate on her reaching here between the 2o th & 
the last of the month, she said she would bring John, whose health was 
not very good, & the girls with her, Bob she speaks of having at school 
in Kentucky, but I expect he will cut up so at the idea of being left, 
that she will be forced to bring him. We can manage to accommodate 
them all comfortable. Dick had returned home from the plantation 
where he had been some days, & alth much improved in health, was still 
complaining, & thought he had not recovered sufficiently to join you." 
I hope Ann will bring all the children with her, as I do not want any 
thing to mar in the slightest degree her sojourn with her mother & sister. 
</p><p>
Betty says there is a tolerable school at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> for boys of Bobs age 
sufficient good I hope to keep him up to what he has already acquired. 
As to the course to be pursued by the boys as to their professions, which 
depends on so many contingencies that nothing at the present time can 
be determined on with anything like a certainty ; it will be well if possible to give them good & substantial educations, after which to be gov 
erned by circumstances as they may occur ; if John desires it I should 
very much like to see him in the navy ; but the first consideration is for 
his health to fully restored. It will depend on Bobs habits & turn of 
mind whether I would wish to see him or not enter any branch of the 
public service, for if his temper, habits &c were such as to make it probable he would have to quit the same, I certainly would prefer his not 
making the attempt

Your several letters accompanied by the " dirty sheet " printed in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> containing communication from an officer here to one in that 
place, filled with misrepresentations, & I may say falsehoods, as the writer 
knew they were untrue, it being a puppy belonging to one of the Regts. 
of Artillery by the name of Curd 1 who was in a great hurry to leave the 
country, was duly rec d as well as yours containing an acc t of Hamiltons 
letter as well as the Buffalo paper containing the same ; such things are 
beneath my notice, & do not give me the least concern, & I expect to see 
& hear of many such squibs being fired at me, by the envious, depraved 
& wicked ; Mr H is also very anxious to to leave the country & get 
on the recruiting service. I have declined granting his application in 
regard to the same Curd took good care to be well on his way out 
of the country before giving to the community through his brother officer 
his budget of falsehoods & misrepresentations ; but so we go 
</p><p>
I presume Col Taylor made a visit to Fort Polk before leaving for 
Carmargo, or this place, he has not yet returned but I look for him in a 
few days. The attack referred to on the courage or want of it, as regards 
a certain individual referred to by you, is entirely without foundation & 
gotten up for the basest & most contemptable purposes ; being a base slander 
</p><p>
I expect to leave here with a portion of the comm d in three or four 
days for Saltillo, to take possession of that place, the enemy having fallen 
back to San Luis Potosi 300 miles beyond there ; as soon as I establish 
the command that will be left there, I shall return here & then act as 
circumstances may in my judgment warrant or justify 
</p><p>
I hope when you hear from Ann again she & the children will have 
reached Baton Rouge without accident, if not that they will very soon do 
so Wishing you & yours continued health & prosperity I remain 
truly your

U. S. Army Fort Polk 
</p><p>
P. S. I was highly gratified to hear the health of the troops at 
Fort Polk were improving, & hope the hospital is nearly if not quite 
completed ; the course pursued by you as regards discharging volunteers 
was quite right, also as regards your correspondence with Heiskill one 
should never commit himself in any way even so far as to place himself 
in a position which could be carped at, much less in one which could be 
taken advantage of. I was pleased to hear you were keeping up your 
correspondence with Dr Mower, he is an able physician & surgeon, as 
well as an accomplished gentleman & scholar. When you next write 
present my respects to him

Surgeon Wharton I presume you have heard died at Wools command ; Foot we hear left that command, or the comand him, quite ill, so 
much so, it was presumed he could not recover. Surg n Harney has been 
ordered to take his place
