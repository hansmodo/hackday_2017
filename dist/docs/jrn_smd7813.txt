One of these days, when peace is restored and we 
are quietly settled in our allotted corners of this 
wide world without any particularly exciting event 
to alarm us ; and with the knowledge of what is now 
the future, and will then be the dead past; seeing 
that all has been for the best for us in the end ; that 
all has come right in spite of us, we will wonder how 
we could ever have been foolish enough to await 
each hour in such breathless anxiety. We will ask 
ourselves if it was really true that nightly, as we lay 
down to sleep, we did not dare plan for the morning, 
feeling that we might be homeless and beggars before 
the dawn. How unreal it will then seem ! We will say 
it was our wild imagination, perhaps. But how 
bitterly, horribly true it is now! 
</p><p>
Four days ago the Yankees left us, to attack <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>, leaving their flag flying in the Garrison 
without a man to guard it, and with the understanding that the town would be held responsible for it. 
It was intended for a trap; and it succeeded. For 
night before last, it was pulled down and torn to pieces. 
</p><p>
Now, unless Will will have the kindness to sink 
a dozen of their ships up there, I hear he has command of the lower batteries, they will be back in 
a few days, and will execute their threat of shelling thyiOwn. If they do, what will become of us? All we ipect in the way of earthly property is as yet mere 
paper, which will be so much trash if the South is 
ruined, as it consists of debts due father by many 
planters for professional services rendered, who, of 
course, will be ruined, too, so all money is gone. 
That is nothing, we will not be ashamed to earn our 
bread, so let it go. 
</p><p>
But this house is at least a shelter from the weather, 
all sentiment apart. And our servants, too; how 
could they manage without us? The Yankees, on 
the river, and a band of guerrillas in the woods, are 
equally anxious to precipitate a fight. Between the 
two fires, what chance for us? It would take only a 
little while to burn the city over our heads. They say 
the women and children must be removed, these 
guerrillas. Where, please? Charlie says we must go 
to Greenwell. And have this house pillaged? For 
Butler has decreed that no unoccupied house shall 
be respected. If we stay through the battle, if the 
Federals are victorious, we will suffer. For the officers here were reported to have said, "If the people 
here did not treat them decently, they would know 
what it was when Billy Wilson's crew arrived. 
They would give them a lesson ! " That select crowd 
is now in <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>. Heaven help us when they 
reach here! It is in these small cities that the greatest outrages are perpetrated. What are we to do? 
</p><p>
A new proclamation from Butler has just come. It 
seems that the ladies have an ugly way of gathering 
their skirts when the Federals pass, to avoid any 
possible contact. Some even turn up their noses. unladylike, to say the least. But it is, maybe, owing to 
the odor they have, which is said to be unbearable 
even at this early season of the year. Butler says, 
whereas the so-called ladies of <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> insult 
his men and officers, he gives one and all permission 
to insult any or all who so treat them, then and 
there, with the assurance that the women will not 
receive the slightest protection from the Government, and that the men will all be justified. I did not 
have time to read it, but repeat it as it was told to 
me by mother, who is in utter despair at the brutality of the thing. These men our brothers? Not mine ! 
Let us hope for the honor of their nation that Butler 
is not counted among the gentlemen of the land. 
And so, if any man should fancy he cared to kiss me, 
he could do so under the pretext that I had pulled 
my dress from under his feet! That will justify 
them ! And if we decline their visits, they can insult 
us under the plea of a prior affront. Oh! Gibbes! 
George ! Jimmy ! never did we need your protection 
as sorely as now. And not to know even whether 
you are alive ! When Charlie joins the army, we will 
be defenseless, indeed. Come to my bosom, O my 
discarded carving-knife, laid aside under the impression that these men were gentlemen. We will be 
close friends once more. And if you must have a 
sheath, perhaps I may find one for you in the heart 
of the first man who attempts to Butlerize me. I 
never dreamed of kissing any man save my father and 
brothers. And why any one should care to kiss any 
one else, I fail to understand. And I do not propose 
to learn to make exceptions. 
</p><p>
Still no word from the boys. We hear that Norfolk has been evacuated ; but no details. George was 
there. Gibbes is wherever Johnston is, presumably on the Rappahannock ; but it is more than six weeks 
since we have heard from either of them, and all communication is cut off.
