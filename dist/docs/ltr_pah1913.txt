DEAR SIR : Every possible method has been taken to hasten the march of the new Levys. I am sorry to observe a remissness among the officers, 
over whom the executive of this country can exercise no command in the opinion of most people. Indeed they have a general want of necessarys to 
struggle with. But they do not in general exert themselves as they ought. I've sent express twice to each colonel, & besides have had public advertisements repeatedly in the papers. All won t 
do. They are remiss. I guess two-thirds of the continental Eecruits are enlisted, but in broken Quotas. Our three Battalions are more than half 
full. The inlistments for Georgia (agt. my opinion permitted by the assembly) have greatly hurt ours. A fellow called the i Dragging Canoe, has seceded 
from the nation of Cherokees &&amp;gt; 400 Warriors have followed his fortune, lying in the Woods & making War on us notwithstanding the peace made 
with Col. Christian. We have a Treaty on foot still with that people. Orders were issued a few days since for destroying Pluggy's Town. Three 
hundred Militia are ordered on that service from the Neighbourhood of Fort Pitt. Five swift sailing Boats are gone for arms to the West Indies. Our 
Factorys are making some. Perhaps we may arm. our own Troops & some others, especially if the importation succeeds. A French ship &&amp;gt; 2 Briggs 
are lately arrived here. Tis said they ve warlike stores. If so my next will tell, as I've sent to purchase them I hear to-day the people on the Eastern Shore are very uneasy, and that from the 
great number of disaffected in Maryland and Delaware the Whigs of Virginia are inclined to move away their Familys. I suppose the number is small 
and those of the richer sort. The poor can t remove. The affairs of that shore puzzle me. Pray advise me what it is best to do. What can be the reason of no 
mails from the North ? Adieu my dear friend. May your powerful assistance be never wanted when the best Interests of America are in Danger. May the 
subterfuges of Toryism be continually exposed and counteracted by that zeal and ability you have so long displayed, to the peculiar Honor of your native 
country, &, the advantage of all the United States.
