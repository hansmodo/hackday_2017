Last night I got the copy of the speech and read it. ... 
There is one point which you concede to the Southern 
States, perfect liberty to prefer slavery if they choose ; 
still, you hit the system as though you had feeling 
against it. I know it is difficult to maintain perfect 
impartiality. In all new cases, it is well you should 
adhere to your conviction to exclude slavery because you 
prefer free labor. That is your perfect right, and I was 
glad to see that you disavowed any intention to molest 
slavery even in the District. Now, so certain and inevitable is it that the physical and political power of this 
nation must pass into the hands of the free States, that I 
think you all can well afford to take things easy, bear 
the buffets of a sinking dynasty, and even smile at their 
impotent threats. You ought not to expect the Southern 
politicians to rest easy when they see and feel this crisis 
so long approaching, and so certain to come absolutely, 
at hand.

But this year's presidential election will be a dangerous one ; may actually result in civil war, though I still 
cannot believe the South would actually secede in the 
event of the election of a Kepublican.
