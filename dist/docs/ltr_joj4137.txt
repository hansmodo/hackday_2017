Sir, 
</p><p>
A friend of mine lately sent me your address to your constituents relative to the treaty. I have read it with 
pleasure. Had all the publications on that subject been written with equal knowledge and attention, or with equal 
candour and decorum, more truth would have been disseminated, and less irritation excited. 
</p><p>
I observe in it the following paragraph, viz. " Objections both personal and constitutional have been made to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a>. He has been said to be prepossessed in favour of 
Britain, and an avowed enemy to France. If this had been true, it would have been a sufficient reason for rejecting 
him — but it is not true. I can contradict it, and do, on my own knowledge. I heard <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a> express, in public and 
private, and those who have been much more and much longer acquainted with him, assure me that he always has expressed the utmost pleasure in the French revolution, and 
the warmest wishes for its success ; the greatest dislike for the former government, and sentiments of the highest esteem and respect for the nation." 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you, sir, for this vindication ; but 
it being summary and in general terms, and comprehending 
only one of the points, I think it best, in order to obviate all 
further questions, to state particularly my sentiments relative to them both. 
</p><p>
It has, for obvious reasons, been judged convenient to 
represent me as being strongly attached to the interests of 
Britain, and as being equally hostile to those of France. 
Before I take notice of either, I will premise, that as it is 
my duty, so it is my inclination and resolution, never to be 
a partisan of any foreign court or nation, but to be and 
remain with those independent and genuine Americans, who 
think it unwise and improper to meddle in foreign politics, 
and who regard all foreign interference in our counsels as 
derogatory to the honour, and dangerous to the best interests of the United States. 
</p><p>
Not being of British descent, I cannot be influenced by 
that delicacy towards their national character, nor that partiality for it, which might otherwise be supposed not to be 
unnatural. I nevertheless continue to concur in, and to 
express those sentiments of esteem for that nation, which 
are expressed, and I believe with great sincerity, in the 
early journals of Congress. 
</p><p>
It is not from the characters of this or that administration, or prevailing party in the government, that the character 
of a nation is to be inferred. A true judgment of it can no otherwise be formed, than by observing the general 
tenor of their dispositions and conduct, viewed under all their circumstances and in all their relations, during a 
long course of time. It certainly is chiefly owing to institutions, laws, and principles of policy and government, 
originally derived to us as British colonists, that, with the favour of Heaven, the people of this country are what they are. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the tendency which all arbitrary governments, and particularly the long reign of such a monarch 
as Lewis the Fifteenth, have to debase and corrupt their 
subjects, the people of France continued to be highly distinguished by their talents, and by their progress in the arts 
both of peace and of war. 
</p><p>
It is true that 1 returned from that country to this, with 
opinions unfavourable to their court; but not only without 
a wish unfriendly to them, but. on the contrary, with sentiments of good-will and regard. That I have from early 
life expressed a strong dislike to the former arbitrary government of France, is well known. The more I became 
acquainted with it, the more it appeared to me to be a government always dreadful in theory, and always more or 
less so in practice, according to the characters of those by 
whom its powers were exercised. 
</p><p>
In the revolution which put a period to it, I did cordially 
rejoice : I mean the one which limited the powder of the king, 
and restored liberty to the people. The patriotic Assembly 
which concerted and accomplished that revolution, and the 
people and army who concurred in and supported it, did 
themselves immortal honour ; and impressed me (although 
my judgment did not accord with all their acts) with great 
respect and esteem for them, and with the w 7 armest wishes 
for the ultimate success and perfection of the constitution 
and government which they established. 
</p><p>
The successors of that memorable Assembly produced 
another revolution. They abolished the constitution and 
government which had been just established, and brought 
the king to the scaffold. 
</p><p>
This revolution did not give me pleasure. I derived no 
satisfaction from the disastrous fate of a prince, who (from 
whatever motives) had- done us essential services, and to 
whom we had frequently presented the strongest assuranccs of our attachment and affection. This revolution 
had, in my eye, more the appearance of a wo than a blessing. It has caused torrents of blood and of tears, and been 
marked in its progress by atrocities very injurious to the 
cause of liberty, and offensive to morality and humanity. 
</p><p>
But this revolution having abolished the monarchy, declared France a republic, and received the general concurrence of the nation, a new constitution became indispensable: 
and as, in case this revolution should be overthrown by the 
combined powers, they would doubtless dictate what that 
new constitution should be (an interference not to be submitted to), I wished success to the revolution, so far as it 
had for its object not the disorganizing and managing of 
other states, which ought neither to be attempted nor permitted, but the exclusive ordering of all internal affairs, and 
the establishment of any constitution which the nation should 
prefer. It gives me pleasure to find that one has lately 
been so established ; and I sincerely wish it may be the 
means of giving permanent peace, liberty, and good government to France. 
</p><p>
As to the issue of the war, I am far from desiring that 
either France, Britain, or Germany, or any other power, 
should acquire a decided preponderance in Europe. In my 
opinion, it would conduce more to the welfare and peace 
of those nations, and also of the United States, that they 
should remain in capacity to limit and repress the ambition 
of each other. 
</p><p>
I will conclude this letter with an extract from one which 
I wrote to the late secretary of state, dated at London, on 
21st November, <a href='/results.php?year=1794'>1794</a>, viz: — 
</p><p>
" I daily become more and more convinced of the general 
friendly disposition of this country towards ours ; let us 
cherish it Let us cultivate friendship with all nations. By treating them all with justice and kindness, and 
by preserving that self-respect which forbids our yielding 
to the influence or policy of any of them, we shall, with the 
Divine blessing, secure peace, union, and respectability." 
</p><p>
With sentiments of esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, sir, 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
