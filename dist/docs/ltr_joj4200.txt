Sir, 
</p><p>
I received by the last mail the pamphlet on " the Missouri Question," which you did me the favour to send. 
The remarks and statements contained in it place the 
pernicious influence of slavery on the welfare of our country in conspicuous and impressive points of view. 
</p><p>
The obvious dictates both of morality and policy teach 
us, that our free nation cannot encourage the extension of 
slavery, nor the multiplication of slaves, without doing 
violence to their principles, and without depressing their 
power and prosperity. 
</p><p>
It appears to me desirable, that your remarks and statements, as well as the excellent arguments of <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>, 
should be widely diffused ; they will have a strong tendency 
to render public opinion on this very important subject correct and settled. 
</p><p>
Accept my acknowledgments for this mark of attention, 
and for the inducements which prompted it. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
