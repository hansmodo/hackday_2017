MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I received, by Dr. W , your kind letter of February 14th. He was very punctual to his commission. 
He has been three times to visit us. He came out this 
afternoon to let me know that he should leave <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> on Tuesday. By him I have to thank my dear 
sister for three letters, and to confess myself much 
in arrears. 'T is in vain to say that I have had a 
sick family ; that I have had a large family ; that I 
have been engaged in company. These are poor 
excuses for not writing ; nor will I exculpate myself 
by alleging that I wanted a subject. My pride would 
not suffer such a plea. What, then, has been the 
cause ? " Confess freely, and say that it was mere 
indolence, real laziness," as in truth I fear it has 
been. Yet conscience, that faithful monitor, has 
reprehended me very, very often. I was very sick ; 
(so sick, that I have not yet recovered the shock I 
received from it,) for near two months before I left 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. When I got to this place, I found this 
house just calculated to make the whole family sick ; 
cold, damp, and wet with new paint. A fine place 
for an invalid ; but, through a kind <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, I 
sustained it, though others suffered. Happily, after 
a very tedious two months, Thomas recovered so as 
to get abroad ; but his health is now very infirm, and 
I fear an attendance upon two offices through the 
day, and studying through the evening at home, is 
not calculated to mend it. But it is a maxim here, 
that he who dies with studying dies in a good cause, 
and may go to another world much better calculated 
to improve his talents, than if he had died a blockhead. Well, knowledge is a fine thing, and mother 
Eve thought so ; but she smarted so severelv for 
hers, that most of her daughters have been afraid of 
it since.

We have had a very severe winter in this State, 
as you may judge when I tell you that we have 
consumed forty cords of w r ood in four months. It 
has been as cold as any winter we have at the northward. The 17th and 18th of this month I dined 
with all my windows open, put out the fires, and ate 
ice to cool me ; the glasses at 80. This is the 
20th. Yesterday it snowed nearly the whole day, 
and to-day it is a keen northwester ; and I presume it will freeze hard to-night. Yet the verdure is 
beautiful ; full as much as I shall find by the middle 
of May in Massachusetts, where I hope then to be. 
Yet I shall have some regrets at leaving this place, 
just as the season begins to open all its beauties 
upon me. I am told that this spot is very delightful 
as a summer residence. The house is spacious. 
The views from it are rather beautiful than sublime ; 
the country round has too much of the level to be 
in my style. The appearance of uniformity wearies 
the eye, and confines the imagination. We have a 
fine view of the whole city from our windows ; a 
beautiful grove behind the house, through which 
there is a spacious gravel walk, guarded by a number of marble statues, whose genealogy I have not 
yet studied, as the last week is the first time I have 
visited them. A variety of fine fields of wheat and 
grass are in front of the house, and, on the right 
hand, a pretty view of the Schuylkill presents itself. 
But now for the reverse of the picture. We are 
only two miles from town, yet have I been more 
of a prisoner this winter than I ever was in my 
life. The road from hence to the pavement, is one 
mile and a half, the soil a brick clay, so that, when 
there has been heavy rain, or a thaw, you must 
wallow to the city through a bed of mortar without 
a bottom, the horses sinking to their knees. If it 
becomes cold, then the holes and the roughness are 
intolerable. From the inhabitants of this place I 
have received every mark of politeness and civility. 
The ladies here are well-educated, well-bred, and 
well-dressed. There is much more society than in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and I am much better pleased and satisfied than I expected to be when I was destined to remove here. Adieu. Your sister, 
</p><p>
A. A.
