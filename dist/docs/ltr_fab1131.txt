In my last letter I wrote you about the snow on the mountains and I really had an idea of going up just to
roll in it. Since then I have been saved the trouble for the last four days we have had an incessant snow storm and it now lays about two feet deep all over the country and from four to six feet on the mountains a little way out of town. At first we snow-balled, the whole town engaging in the sport like school boys, but after a while the snow accumulated on the lightly built roofs and down came one house. We dug out our cow, not hurt much. Yesterday morning down came a store, a perfect smash. We rushed in and dug out two men. One of them said he had 1000 bbls on his back for some time but strange to say, neither of them was much hurt. The bottles of claret, however, suffered and the snow looked tinged with blood. After this, we mounted the roofs and shovelled off the snow.

Owing to this long spell of weather there is a right smart chance of a famine. No mule trains can get through and we are reduced to beef and some of us are fortunate enough to have a few potatoes. There is no flour nor meal nor beans. I have sold everything in the shape of eatables but the pickles and sardines and the sardines are going fast. I was fortunate enough to buy of a man on the river just before the snow set in, 2200 lbs of potatoes. We saved a few to eat and I sold the rest in one day for 37 1/2¢ per lb (made $250 easy). Flour has been selling at 75¢ per lb. This is awful business for the miners but owing to the rise in everything, we have made more than in all the previous summer and if we had had the money to have laid in a large stock of flour we could have made a fortune. Another chance slipped by, you see. I am content, however. Now, if I go into a speculation to get my money back I have come out the loser so often.

Rufus Stover left here yesterday for the lower country, starved out. Howard Buck is still staying at the North Fork about 30 miles from here, living on venison. All the
hotels in town failed when the prices advanced so much, but two. They still keep open at $1.50 a meal.

Doctor Winston and Mr. McKenzie, next door neighbors, and engaged in the butcher business and one or two more of us have formed a mess. The Doctor has a negro boy he brought to this country who cooks. We call our hotel the Metropolitan and have lived first-rate at a cost of about $12 per week each. But one thing after another has disappeared from our table until, if you will analyze any dish, you will find it composed principally of beef. But we don't fall away any and the Doctor and I sing and chant by way of soup and smoke our pipes and tobacco for a dessert. We also have hot whisky toddy and brandy peaches for the evening while the class, as we term the five or six men who generally come in and sit with us of an evening, listen to the Doctor's discourse on scientific subjects. There are a few fine whole-souled men here who have travelled and are well informed on all subjects. The Doctor and McKenzie are from Jefferson City Missouri, and are an exception to the people from that State generally. Beckett from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>, has travelled all over Canada and England. Williams from New Orleans and Blanchard from Kentucky, are the Southern representatives. So we have all the different characters in the Union and there is a vast difference. We all have different pronunciations and use different words to express the same ideas. One is sensitive on some points which we in New England wouldn't notice, but we all agree that there are gentlemen from all parts.

I have met with all kinds of people and from my experience from what I have seen of Southern and Western character, I am not ashamed to hail from Yankee Land, but I am hardly ever taken for a Yankee. So I expect I have lost some of the characteristics or adopted some others. I can in nine cases out of ten name the State a
man is from after observing him a little. You know very little about the people that compose this vast Republic by travelling in New England.

We had the election returns some time ago, of course they would travel like all other bad tidings. Well, we expected to hear of the defeat of the Old General but thought he would run a better race than he did. If the counts are correct he got but four States. I think it an insult to him by the American people and if I were in his place I would emigrate and enlist under some other government where my services would be appreciated.

It is hardly necessary to write Father as you can tell him all the news. We intend to remain here until the beef gives out. We have enough to last about two weeks, and then travel out on snow shoes always providing it does not clear off and some provisions come in, which is most likely.
