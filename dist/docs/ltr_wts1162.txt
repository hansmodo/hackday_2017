My Dear Sir : John Sherman has sent me your letter 
of Aug. 2d, in which you intimate a wish that certain 
nine regiments of Indiana troops should be ordered 
where they can be furloughed so as to vote in the fall 
elections. 
</p><p>
Of course it is impossible. I have not now troops 
enough to do what the case admits of without extra hazard, and to send away a single man would be an act of 
injustice to the remainder. I think you need not be 
concerned about the soldiers' vote. They will vote, it 
may not be in the coming election, but you may rest 
assured the day will come when the soldiers will vote, 
and the only doubt is if they will permit the stay-athomes to vote at all. 
</p><p>
I hope you will be elected ; but I do think the conscript-law is the only one that is wanted for the next 
few years, and if the President uses it freely he can 
checkmate the Copperheads, who are not in favor of 
being governed by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff. Davis</a>, but are afraid to go to the 
war. Their motives are transparent. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff. Davis</a> despises them more than you do, and if he prevails in this 
war he will deal with Copperheads with infinitely more 
severity than he will with men who fight for their 
country and for principle. 
</p><p>
I am, etc., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>, 
</p><p>
Major-General.
