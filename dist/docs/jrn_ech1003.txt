After two days of calm, we were moving rapidly along to the northeast with a strengthening wind, when it shifted to the northeast, dead ahead. They soon tacked ship and since then our course has been northwest. The weather has been dark and gloomy with a heavy mist falling, and this evening we have had several showers.

A week ago such a miserable dinner was sent to us that very few could bring themselves to touch it, and the Captain was requested to come down and take a view of what he had furnished us to live upon. He came and saw it and doubtless felt somewhat abashed for he gave some directions for the future that will prove of no service to any one, and then left. About ten days since, my cheese and other small stores laid in at Valparaiso gave out, and our potatoes being entirely exhausted, we live intolerably hard. This morning I purchased a lot of flour from a friend who had supplied himself more liberally, and henceforth
by furnishing this much flour for bread at my own expense, I shall be able to get along rather well.
<p></p>
Today I understood for the first time that while we were in Valparaiso, an instrument of writing was gotten up, commending our Captain in the highest terms for his good seamanship, gentlemanly deportment toward passengers, etc., and signed by a select few of the first cabin passengers, the others of us not being let into the secret, and then forwarded to Mr. Hathaway! This I suppose was done for fear that some one would send a true statement of the case home. The signers in this case are mere fawning sycophants, for there is not a single one of them who has not heaped maledictions against him.

The souse that we have been furnished with recently for breakfast is not fit to eat and it remains untouched. Yesterday two large pans of it were carried on deck while the Captain was at breakfast, and the American flag stuck over it. When he came out, he saw it and enquired of the steward, "Who put it there?" The steward told him he didn't know and was directed to take it away. This morning a mixture of warm water and corn meal was sent us as mush, but as we expected it fried, we ordered the steward to take it back as it was impossible for us to eat it in that manner. He returned it and the Captain was informed of the occurrence, but he has no disposition to remedy any evil, and thus the matter rests.

Friday afternoon the startling cry of "Fire!" was heard from one end of the ship to the other, and a dense cloud of heavy black smoke was seen to issue through the roof of the "galley." Soon the hot flames rose almost high enough to catch the "main sheet" but all hands instantly rushed to the rescue and by
passing a few buckets of water it was soon extinguished. Some of the passengers were horror-struck when they saw the flames issue forth, and indeed it was very fortunate we succeeded in preventing the fire from attacking the rigging, for in that case nothing but the hand of Providence would have saved us, and not unlikely at this time we would have been drifting on the broad ocean in small boats, instead of being comfortably seated in our old ship. The fire was started by the upsetting of a pot of pork fat into the stove.
