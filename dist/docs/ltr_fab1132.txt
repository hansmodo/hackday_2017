For the past two months we have had scarcely any communication with the lower country. The whole valley has been overflowed and the mountains covered with snow. We have had a winter such as you generally have, but the snow is gone now and the streams are down.
</p><p>
Provisions are still very high, but will soon go down. I am selling flour, sugar, salt, beans and rice for one dollar per lb. I have five mules packing from Shasta and have been doing very well, but some part of the time we have been entirely out. For one week we had nothing in town but barley. Saturday a drove of cattle arrived and they sold out six in one day at 40¢ per lb.

At Yreka, 125 miles north, things are worse than here. Salt is $10 a pound; no flour at any price; nothing but venison. This will injure this part of the country. A great many of the people have left but we are about as
well off as any part of the county. Sacramento has been overflowed again and provisions all over the mines are high. If the weather holds good we shall soon have a full supply.

Cole is still in Sacramento. He and Sarah are in good health and will come up as soon as they can. He started twice but could not get here as Sarah could not swim.

I heard by your letter of October of the death of Kirk for the first time. He anticipated great pleasure in going home and seeing your family and wished me to go at the same time, but we little think of dying while talking over these matters. In fact, we think less of it in this country where we are continually popping off, than at home. I felt sad when I heard of the death of poor Kirk. I enjoyed his company when I was with him very much because we could talk about Bucksport, and I had expected to see him at home some time and talk about California, with you. But our plans are easily upset here by an overruling Power, Who doeth all things well.

It's no use for me to try and write seriously about these matters. We have no pious minister to talk and improve these providences to us as you have; no churches to go to on Sunday, and sit and reflect over the past week. Sunday, if observed at all, is a holiday. Business and pleasure are all the topics. I often think how it will seem to me to go home and go to church and keep Sunday as we used to keep it at home.

Well, we have had some sensible pleasure here. On New Year's eve we had a ball. I was one of the managers. We endeavored to get it up in good shape; so elected the best men for managers and invited only respectable ladies (you have to cull them out here). We found thirty two in town and vicinity and had twenty four at the ball. It went off first-rate. I was afraid there would be a row of
some kind but every one behaved themselves with propriety and enjoyed it much.
</p><p>
Clothes were in great demand and it was fun to see men whom we had always seen in a red shirt, sporting a dress coat and white vest. I was introduced to all the ladies. They were all married but three, but their husbands were very obliging and we all danced. Every one dances in this country and a party would be a dry one without it. Most of the ladies were young, just married and come out here and were glad of this chance to get acquainted with each other. One, Mrs. Carr from Wisconsin, is very ladylike and genteel and has evidently moved in the first circles. Mrs. Harper put on more airs than anyone. She waltzes rather better than I would want my wife to. Some of them were rotten, on the backwoods order, but I found a much better sample of ladies than I expected to up here.

Weaverville has had much the appearance of a quiet country village lately. McGee, the great shooting character, has left town and we have not had a shot fired for a month. Gambling is dull, the miners having as much as they can do to buy something to eat. Checkers and backgammon are more in play than monte and faro.

John Chinaman (frequently multiplied) is one of my best customers. There are thirty or forty of them and today they have come to town in force. One of them wrote me a sign in Chinese.
