At an early hour today the Secretary of War accompanied by the Adjutant-General of the army called. They had done so at my request. After much consultation with them I directed the organization into brigades and divisions of the ten regiments of troops authorized by Congress to be raised to serve during the war. I also directed the organization into brigades and divisions of the volunteer forces called out in November last and during the present month, which had not heretofore been done. I directed also the apportionment of these forces to the two columns commanded by Generals Scott and Taylor. According to this apportionment, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> will have with him something over 20,000 men, and General Taylor will have with him something over 12,000 men. The Santa Fé column will be about 2,500 strong.
