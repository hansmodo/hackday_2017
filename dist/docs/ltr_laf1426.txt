<p>
TO MADAME DE LAFAYETTE.
</p><p>
October 1st, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>.
</p><p>
I wrote to you, my dearest love, the 12th of September; the twelfth was
the day after the eleventh, and I have a little tale to relate to you
concerning that eleventh day. To render my action more meritorious, I
might tell you that prudent reflections induced me to remain for some
weeks in my bed, safe sheltered from all danger; but I must acknowledge
that I was encouraged to take this measure by a slight wound, which I
met with I know not how, for I did not, in truth, expose myself to
peril. It was the first conflict at which I had been present; so you
see how very rare engagements are. It will be the last of this
campaign, or, in all probability, at least, the last great battle; and
if anything should occur, you see that I could not myself be present.
</p><p>
You may, therefore, my love, feel perfectly secure. I have much
pleasure in thus reassuring you. While I am desiring you not to be
alarmed on my account, I repeat to myself that you love me; and this
little conversation with my own heart is inexpressibly delightful to
me, for I love you more tenderly than I have ever done before.
</p><p>
My first occupation was to write to you the day after that affair: I
told you that it was a mere trifle, and I was right; all I fear is that
you should not have received my letter. As General Howe is giving, in
the meantime, rather pompous details of his American exploits to the
king his master, if he should write word that I am wounded, he may also
write word that I am killed, which would not cost him anything; but I
hope that my friends, and you especially, will not give faith to the
reports of those persons who last year dared to publish that General
Washington, and all the general officers of his army, being in a boat
together, had been upset, and every individual drowned. But let us
speak about the wound: it is only a flesh-wound, and has neither
touched bone nor nerve. The surgeons are astonished at the rapidity
with which it heals; they are in an ecstasy of joy each time they dress
it, and pretend it is the finest thing in the world: for my part, I
think it most disagreeable, painful, and wearisome; but tastes often
differ: if a man, however, wished to be wounded for his amusement only,
he should come and examine how I have been struck, that he might be
struck precisely in the same manner. This, my dearest love, is what I
pompously style my wound, to give myself airs, and render myself
interesting.
</p><p>
I must now give you your lesson, as wife of an American general
officer. They will say to you, "They have been beaten:" you must
answer,--"That is true; but when two armies of 'equal number' meet in
the field, old soldiers have naturally the advantage over new ones;
they have, besides, had the pleasure of killing a great many of the
enemy, many more than they have lost." They will afterwards add: "All
that is very well; but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> is taken, the capital of America,
the rampart of liberty!" You must politely answer, "You are all great
fools! <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> is a poor forlorn town, exposed on every side,
whose harbour was already closed; though the residence of congress lent
it, I know not why, some degree of celebrity. This is the famous city
which, be it added, we will, sooner or later, make them yield back to
us." If they continue to persecute you with questions, you may send
them about their business in terms which the Viscount de Noailles will
teach you, for I cannot lose time by talking to you of politics.
</p><p>
I have delayed writing your letter till the last, in the hope of
receiving one from you, answering it, and giving you the latest
intelligence of my health; but I am told, if I do not send immediately
to congress, twenty-five leagues from hence, my captain will have set
out, and I shall lose the opportunity of writing to you. This is the
cause of my scrawl being more unintelligible than usual; however, if I
were to send you anything but a hurried scrawl, I ought, in that case,
to beg your pardon, from the singularity of the case. Recollect, my
dearest love, that I have only once heard of you, from <a href='/results.php?tla=kap' rel=''>Count Pulaski</a>. I
am much provoked, and am very miserable. Imagine how dreadful it is to
be far from all I love, in this state of suspense and almost despair;
it is impossible to support it; and I feel, at the same time, that I do
not deserve to be pitied. Why was I so obstinately bent on coming
hither? I have been well punished for my error; my affections are too
strongly rooted for me to be able to perform such deeds. I hope you
pity me; if you knew all I suffer, especially at this moment, when
everything concerning you is so deeply interesting! I cannot, without
shuddering, think of this. I am told that a parcel has arrived from
France; I have despatched expresses on every road and in every corner;
I have sent an officer to congress; I am expecting him every day, and
you may conceive with what feelings of intense anxiety. My surgeon is
also very anxious for his arrival, for this suspense keeps my blood in
a state of effervescence, and he would fain require that it should flow
calmly. O, my dearest life, if I receive good news from you, and all I
love,--if those delightful letters arrive to-day, how happy I shall
be!--but with what agitation, also, I shall open them!
</p><p>
Be perfectly at ease about my wound; all the faculty in America are
engaged in my service. I have a friend, who has spoken to them in such
a manner that I am certain of being well attended to; that friend is
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker friend met">General Washington</a>. This excellent man, whose talents and virtues I
admired, and whom I have learnt to revere as I know him better, has now
become my intimate friend: his affectionate interest in me instantly
won my heart. I am established in his house, and we live together like
two attached brothers, with mutual confidence and cordiality. This
friendship renders me as happy as I can possibly be in this country.
When he sent his best surgeon to me, he told him to take charge of me
as if I were his son, because he loved me with the same affection.
Having heard that I wished to rejoin the army too soon, he wrote me a
letter full of tenderness, in which he requested me to attend to the
perfect restoration of my health. I give you these details, my dearest
love, that you may feel quite certain of the care that is taken of me.
Amongst the French officers, who have all expressed the warmest
interest for me, M. de Gimat, my aide-de-camp, has followed me about
like my shadow, both before and since the battle, and has given me
every possible proof of attachment. You may thus feel quite secure on
this account, both for the present and for the future.
</p><p>
All the foreigners who are in the army,--for I do not speak only of
those who have not been employed, and who, on their return to France,
will naturally give an unjust account of America, because the
discontented, anxious to revenge their fancied injuries, cannot be
impartial,--all the foreigners, I say, who have been employed here are
dissatisfied, complain, detest others, and are themselves detested:
they do not understand why I am the only stranger beloved in America,
and I cannot understand why they are so much hated. In the midst of the
disputes and dissensions common to all armies, especially when there
are officers of various nations, I, for my part, who am an easy and a
good-tempered man, am so fortunate as to be loved by all parties, both
foreigners and Americans: I love them all--I hope I deserve their
esteem; and we are perfectly satisfied the one with the other. I am at
present in the solitude of Bethlehem, which the Abb? Raynal has
described so minutely. This establishment is a very interesting one;
the fraternity lead an agreeable and a very tranquil life: we will talk
over all this on my return; and I intend to weary those I love,
yourself, of course, in the first place, by the relation of my
adventures, for you know that I was always a great prattler. You must
become a prattler also, my love, and say many things for me to
Henriette--my poor little Henriette! embrace her a thousand
times--talk of me to her, but do not tell her all I deserve to suffer;
my punishment will be, not to be recognised by her on my arrival; that
is the penance Henriette will impose on me. Has she a brother or a
sister?--the choice is quite indifferent to me, provided I have a
second time the pleasure of being a father, and that I may soon learn
that circumstance. If I should have a son, I will tell him to examine his own heart carefully; and if that heart should be a tender one, if
he should have a wife whom he loves as I love you, in that case I shall advise him not to give way to feelings of enthusiasm, which would
separate him from the object of his affection, for that affection will afterwards give rise to a thousand dreadful fears.
</p><p>
I am writing, by a different opportunity, to various persons, and also
to yourself. I think this letter will arrive first; if this vessel
should accidentally arrive, and the other one be lost, I have given the
viscount a list of the letters I have addressed to him. I forgot to
mention my aunts; give them news of me as soon as this reaches you.
I have made no _duplicata_ for you, because I write to you by every
opportunity. Give news of me, also, to M. Margelay, the Abbe Fayon,
and Desplaces.
</p><p>
A thousand tender regards to my sisters; I permit them to despise me as
an infamous deserter--but they must also love me at the same time. My
respects to Madame la Comtesse Auguste, and Madame de Fronsac. If my
grandfather's letters should not reach him, present to him my
respectful and affectionate regards. Adieu, adieu, my dearest life;
continue to love me, for I love you most tenderly.
</p><p>
Present my compliments to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Dr. Franklin</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Mr. Deane</a>; I wished to write to them, but cannot find time.
