I arrived here about half-past seven o'clock this morning, after having lost half the day yesterday by lying by 
at Greenville, with a headache too heavy to ride with. I am now perfectly well, and after losing to-day with the 
Belpre folks here, and the detention occasioned by getting little Bay shod, shall resume the journey this evening. 
</p><p>
The road is pretty open, having been lately cut out; but I shall endeavor, by traveling a good part of the 
night, to make up for whatever indulgence of shelter or rest I may allow the horses and myself in the day. I 
find the cap the most comfortable luxury I ever traveled with, and think I can adjust a simple handkerchief about 
my head and face in a way to parry the musquitoes, or their more formidable companions the horse-flies. 
</p><p>
I have no care, I assure you, for any thing affecting myself, but through you and my boys ; could I, then, only 
be assured, that you would be as industrious to seek your recreation, and frequently shift the subject of your labors, 
as you are criminal in protracting the intervals of your sedentary occupations, that my boys would not be ever 
exposed to the sun bareheaded and barefoot, my reflections on my business, or subjects of interest or amusement would not, I protest, suffer a moment's interruption. 
Improve, then, the blessing you did not expect, for you could never find it on the Ohio, which a benignant God 
has reserved for you among strangers, in the generous regards of so many worthy families and individuals who have become your friends. Farewell !

Anne and the boys for me.
