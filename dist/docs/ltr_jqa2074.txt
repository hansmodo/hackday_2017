TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 37 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, May 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
On the third instant the National Convention authorized 
the Committee of Public Safety to send two members on 
a secret mission, and in consequence of this authority the 
citizens Sieyes l and Rewbell arrived here on the 8th at the 
same time. The other Representatives who had been in 
mission here, but had for some time past absented them 
selves from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, returned, and the General in Chief 
of the Army of the North came from Utrecht on the same 
day. A deputation from the States General of four members has been appointed to confer with the French Representatives and has been very busily engaged with them 
to the present day. The object of this negotiation is 
secret, and the conjectures relative to it are various. But 
as most probably none of the conjectures will be verified by 
the event, it is scarcely worth while to detail them. The 
circumstances would seem to indicate that the final agreement upon the relative situation in which France and this 
Republic are to stand is the principal point. Hitherto all 
is unsettled. The parties on both sides were very much 
dissatisfied, and even the forms of independence which 
alone had been preserved here were violated in so unequivocal a manner and so frequently, as to have become a 
subject of derision. The present administrators of this 
government have renewed their hopes since the arrival of 
the present representatives, and suppose that the treaty 
which is to proclaim and acknowledge the independence of 
the Batavian people will be concluded in the course of very 
few days. 
</p><p>
In the meantime everything here is in a state of stagnation. The new government has been arrested in the midst 
of their own exertions. They have not been permitted to 
proceed in the new organization of their army and of their 
fleet, and as the British have at this time the undisputed 
command of the channel and of the North Sea, the commerce 
of Holland is almost entirely intercepted. 
</p><p>
The law calling for all the gold and silver of individuals 
has been carried into execution in this province, but as the 
final period of delivery has not yet come it is not known 
whether it has been productive of any considerable quantity. 
</p><p>
We hear but little at present of the intended National 
Convention. The design of calling one is not abandoned, 
but that like everything else depends upon the conclusion 
of the French alliance, which is yet in expectation. 
</p><p>
The probability of a continental peace continues. Spain 
has not yet concluded, but it is expected she will very soon. 
A neutrality from the northern part of Germany is secured 
by the Prussian treaty. 
</p><p>
Two additional articles contain the limits agreed upon for 
the preservation of this neutrality. I have the honor of 
inclosing a copy of them. The sieges of Luxemburg and 
Mentz appear to be the only remaining hostilities that 
designate a state of war. The armies of all the powers at 
war are everywhere else in profound tranquility. The 
object of France, it is said, will be to open the campaign 
by directing the most formidable attack against the Austrian 
dominions in Italy. 
</p><p>
At sea nothing very remarkable has taken place since the 
action in the Mediterranean. The arrival of several ships 
from Brest at Toulon has once more given the superiority of 
force to the French in the Mediterranean. Lord Hood, 
however, has since sailed with a detachment to join the 
British fleet there, which if effected will again restore them 
to an equality, or perhaps a small superiority. Several 
French captains and other officers have arrived here. They 
are to take the command of the ships belonging to this 
Republic. This is one of the articles the most painful to 
the feelings of the new government here, and which it is 
said is insisted on as a preliminary to the conclusion of the 
treaty. 
</p><p>
I have visited the Representatives newly arrived as has 
also been done by the other neutral Ministers. The citizen Sieyes in the course of conversation inquired what was 
the object of the treaty signed by Mr. Jay with the British Ministry. 
</p><p>
" It is a treaty of commerce and its object is also the termination of differences which had arisen between the United States 
and Great Bristain." "Relative to the forts ?" "And to several 
objects of difference. The navigation and commerce of the 
United States had suffered during the present war. The treaty 
probably contains arrangements upon the subject." "But why 
is this treaty still secret?" "It has not yet been ratified, and 
the local situation of the United States with respect to Europe 
renders it peculiarly proper that the ratification should precede 
the publication of the teaty." "Very well for the time necessary 
for the ratification, but after the time which is sufficient has elapsed 
it is thought extraordinary that a treaty of commerce, and a treaty 
which may also relate to other objects, should remain secret. 
Among the public in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> there are people who make it a subject 
of speculation and conjecture that the United States are waiting 
to see what the success of the war will be, and will ratify or reject 
the terms proposed by the treaty according as the events of that 
may turn." "You know, citizen, that among the public in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> 
as among the public in all places there are people who speculate 
upon every event, and are very apt to draw conclusions utterly 
destitute of foundation. The case is such in this instance. The 
treaty in question did not arrive at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> until after the 
session of Congress had come to a constitutional close. I am 
informed, however, that the President of the United States has 
called the Senate together for the purpose of submitting the 
treaty to their deliberations, and it has therefore been merely 
the result of accident if the only article yet public in Europe is 
that which stipulates that nothing in the treaty shall be construed, 
so as to militate with any previous engagement of either party." 
"And the ratification has been debated by this time ?" "Or will 
be in a very short time." 
</p><p>
The conversation is related as accurately as my memory 
will permit, because one of the other Representatives spoke 
to me upon the same subject some time since, and these 
repeated interrogations indicate either a suspicion, or an 
intention to be supposed suspicious, that some stipulation 
interesting to France is contained in the treaty. . . . 
</p><p>
I have the honor, &c. 
</p><p>
