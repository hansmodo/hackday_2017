MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The evening before <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> landed on 
the Island of Montreal, Mr. Carleton embarked his 
garrison on board of some vessels and small craft, and 
made two attempts to pass our batteries, near the 
mouth of Sorel, but was drove back by Colonel Eas-ton, who has behaved with bravery and much alertness. On the 19th, Mr. Carleton, disguised en Canadian, and accompanied by six peasants, found means to 
make his escape. Brigadier-General Prescott surrendered next day by capitulation. What terms General 
Montgomery has given him, I do not know, as he 
was so hurried, in preparing to move immediately to 
Quebec, that he could not find time to send them. 
Prescott and the officers arrived here at four to-day. 
I have just received a return of the officers, men, 
vessels, and stores taken, which I do myself the honor 
to inclose. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor, of the 16th of November, I 
received two days ago. I believe some cannon and 
mortars may be spared ; but none, except what I have 
sent across Lake George, can be got down until that 
or this lake freezes over. I have a very fine thir-teen-inch mortar here, and I will make a push to get 
her over the Lake. But where will you get shells ? 
We have none here. 
</p><p>
Mr. Livingston, Mr. Langdon, and Mr. Paine, arrived 
here at seven this evening. The season was so far 
advanced that I could not wait the orders of congress upon sundry matters, which appeared to me 
absolutely necessary to be carried into immediate execution. I am, however, happy to find, that every 
measure I have pursued corresponds with the instructions given to the Committee. 
</p><p>
I am informed that Prescott has used poor Walker and Allen with a shameful brutality. Of this I 
shall acquaint <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a></a>, to whose Colony 
I shall send him. 
</p><p>
I believe our army in Canada consists of about one 
thousand and nine hundred men, including Colonel 
Arnold's corps. I have suggested to Congress, that 
I thought it necessary that they should be completed 
to three thousand, in the course of the winter, that 
they may be ready, early in the spring, to put Quebec (of which I make no doubt we shall possess our 
selves) into a proper state of defence, to prevent the 
enemy from regaining that important place. I have 
added, that I thought it necessary that preparation 
should be made here to throw in a reenforcement 
early in the spring, if they should be wanted. 
</p><p>
I expect to leave this in a few days for <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. 
I am, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
