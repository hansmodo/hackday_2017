MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote you last, I have made two excursions, 
one to Holland, and one of a week to the Hyde, the 
seat of Mr. Brand-Hollis. Here I was both entertained and delighted. In the first place, I must 
describe Mr. Hollis to you. He is a neat, nice 
bachelor, about fifty years old ; a learned, sensible antiquarian. The late Mr. Hollis whose name 
he bears, could not have chosen a better representative to have bestowed his mantle upon, for with it 
has descended that same love of liberty, benevolence, and philanthropy, which distinguished his 
worthy benefactor. At the entrance of the hall 
you discover the prevailing taste. There are a 
number of ancient busts, amongst which is one of 
Marcus An reikis, who is a great favorite of Mr. 
Hollis. He told us, that all the great painters who 
had drawn Jesus Christ, had taken the busts of Marcus Aurelius as a model. There is a fine white 
marble bust of the late Mr. Hollis in this collection. 
This hall is large and spacious, and has been added 
to the house by Mr. Brand-Hollis since the death of 
his father 1 who left it to him. The chamber where 
we lodged was hung round with portraits of his 
family. It is at one end of the house, and from 
two windows in front, and one at the end, we had 
a beautiful view of lawns and glades, clumps of 
trees and stately groves, and a piece of water full of 
fish. The borders of the walks in the pleasure-grounds are full of rare shrubs and trees, to which 
America has contributed her full proportion. To 
give you some idea of the singularity in which this 
good man discovers his taste, near the walk from 
his door to the road, he has a large and beautiful 
fir, which he calls Dr. Jebb. Having paled this 
tree in with a neat ornament, he has consecrated it 
to the memory of that excellent man, with whom I 
had only the pleasure of a short acquaintance, before he was called to the regions of immortality. 
He possessed an excellent understanding, an unshaken integrity, and a universal benevolence, and 
</p><p>
1 Mr. Brand assumed the name of Hollis, in consequence of 
the bequest of his fortune made to him b} 7 Thomas Hollis. 
was one of the few firm and steady friends to 
America. Cut off in middle age, he left a companion endowed with an understanding superior to most 
of her sex ; always in delicate health, but now a 
prey to the most piercing grief, which will shortly 
close the scene with her. They had no children, 
and, being wholly a domestic woman, the pleasures 
of the world have no relish for her. Her friends 
have at length prevailed with her to go into the 
country for a few weeks. 
</p><p>
But to return to Mr. Hollis's curiosities. In his 
garden he has a tall cypress, which he calls <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel=''>General Washington</a>, and another by its side, which he 
has named for Colonel Smith, as his aid-de-camp. 
This gentleman possesses a taste for all the fine arts. 
In architecture, Palladio is his oracle. Amongst his 
paintings are several of the first masters. Over his 
chimney, in his cabinet, are four small portraits, 
which he told me were his hero, his general, his 
philosopher, and his writer. Marcus Aurelius was 
his general ; his hero, pardon me, I have forgotten 
him. Plato was his writer, and Hutcheson his philosopher, who was also his preceptor. Mr. Hollis 
speaks also of him with great veneration and affection. In the dining-room is a luxuriant picture for a 
bachelor, a Venus and Adonis, by Rembrandt, and 
two views, of a modern date, of the estate in Dorsetshire, which the late Mr. Hollis gave him. As there 
is only a farm-house upon it, he never resides there. 
There are three pastures belonging to it, which are 
called Hollis, Mead, and Brand. In Hollis pasture 
are the remains of its late owner, who left it as an 
order, which was faithfully executed, to be buried 
there, and ten feet deep, the ground to be ploughed 
up over his grave, that not a monument nor stone 
should tell where he lay. This was whimsical and 
singular, be sure, but singularity was his characteristic, as many of his works show. 
</p><p>
Between Mr. Hollis's drawing-room and his library, is a small cabinet which he calls the Boudoir, 
which is full of curiosities ; amongst them a dagger 
made of the sword which killed Sir Edmondbury 
Godfrey, and an inscription, " Memento Godfrey, Protomartvr, pro Religione Protestantium." In eveiy 
part of the house you see Mr. Hollis's owl, cap of 
liberty, and dagger. In this cabinet is a silver cup, 
with a cover in the shape of an owl, with two rubies 
for eyes. This piece of antiquity was dug up at 
Canterbury from ten feet depth, and is considered a 
monkish conceit. Amongst the curiosities in this 
room is a collection of duodecimo prints, to the 
number of forty-five, of all the orders of nuns, 
which Mr. Bridgen purchased some years ago in the 
Austrian Netherlands, and presented to Mr. Hollis. 
Mr. Bridgen has lately composed some verses which 
are placed by the side of them. The idea is, that, 
banished from Germany by the Emperor, they have 
taken an asylum at the Hyde in sight of the Druids, 
the Portico of Athens, and the venerable remains of 
Egyptian, Greek, and Roman antiquities. I would 
not omit the mention of a curious medallion, on which 
is wrought a feast of all the heathen gods and goddesses sitting round a table. Jupiter throws down 
upon the middle of it one of his thunderbolts, flaming at each end with lightning ; he lights his own 
pipe at it, and all the rest follow his example ; Venus, 
Minerva, and Diana are whiffing away. This is the 
first time I ever conceived tobacco an ingredient in 
the feast of the Celestials. It must have been the 
invention of some Dutchman. 
</p><p>
As select and highly-honored friends, we were admitted into the library and to a view of the Miltonian 
Cabinet. In this, he has the original edition of Milton's works, and every other to the present day. 
His library, his pictures, busts, medals, coins, Greek, 
Roman, Carthaginian, and Egyptian, are really a 
selection, as well as a collection, of most rare and 
valuable curiosities. In the early part of his life, he 
visited Rome, Italy, and many other countries. His 
fortune is easy, and, as he has lived a bachelor, his 
time is occupied wholly by the sciences. He has a 
maiden sister of forty-five, I should judge, who lives 
with him when he is in the country. They each of 
them own a house in town, and live separate during 
the winter. Miss Brand is curious in China and in 
birds. She has a piece of all the different manufactures of Porcelain made in this kingdom ; either a cup 
or bowl, a mug or jar. She has also a variety of singing-birds. But what I esteem her much more for is, 
that she has taken from the streets half a dozen poor 
children, clothed them, and put them to school. 
This is doing good not only to the present, but future 
generations. ' T is really curious to see how the 
taste of the master has pervaded all the family. 
John, the coachman, has a small garden spot, which 
he invited me to see. Here was a collection of 
curious flowers, and a little grotto filled with fossils 
and shells. The gardener, whose house stands within 
a few rods of the mansion-house, is bee mad. He 
has a great number of glass hives, in which you may 
see the bees at work ; and he showed me the queen's 
cell. He handles the bees as one would flies ; they 
never sting him. He insists that they know him, 
and will, with great fluency, read you a lecture of an 
hour, upon their laws and government. He has an 
invention for excluding the drones, who are larger 
bees than the rest, and when once out of the hive, 
they cannot return. 
</p><p>
It would require a whole volume to enumerate to 
you all that was worthy attention, and, had you been 
one of the visiters, I dare say you would have collected a larger stock of improvement, and been 
much more minute than I have been in my account 
of curiosities ; but I could not remember amidst 
such a variety. I enclose you a drawing of the 
house, which Mr. Hollis gave me. 
</p><p>
My visit to Holland was agreeable, but to your 
aunt Cranch I must refer you for particulars. Madam Dumas and Miss were absent upon her estate 
until the evening before I came away. I called to pay 
them a visit, and had a very cordial reception. Mr. 
Dumas speaks of you with great affection, as well as 
Madame, and Miss looked kind. The Marquis de 
Verac inquired after you with great politeness ; 
said you were interpreter for him and Mr. Dana 
when you were at Petersburg!], and that, if I was 
dressed in your clothes, he should have taken me for 
you. " Years excepted," he should have added ; 
but that was a mental reservation. He is ambassador at the Hague. 
</p><p>
Remember me affectionately to your brothers, 
and to all other friends ; and believe me most tenderly 
</p><p>
Your ever affectionate mother, 
</p><p>
A. A.

October 14th. Enclosed, you will find a medal of 
his present Majesty. As you have no great affection 
for him, you may exchange it for ,a^y property you 
like better.
