Dear General 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of your favor by Doct'r Tillotson & have waited in Expectation of answering 
it by himself he now Sets out for your Quarter & will Deliver this to you. I have found him 
in Every Respect that agreeable Faithful & Sociable Gentleman you described one part of Your Letter gave me much pain which Contained these words viz " we once were 
Friends" The implication in those words was too Strong not to Strike my attention & I Soon Guessd y e meaning but believe me my D r Sir 
that the Little Sallies of passion which often occur in human Life The Difference of Judgment which 
often happens among men who Act themselves or Even some few Instances of Indiscretions if I had Ever Discovered Such in General Waine 
(which I Confess I have not) could not have occasioned my forgetting his Efforts to Serve his Country and give Satisfaction to those who have 
had the Honor to Command him. I have had the pleasure of being Acquainted with your military Talents Since the Campaign in Canada & cannot without being Guilty of Ingratitude forget 
that you were once Deservedly my friend nor could I pardon myself at this time if I neglected 
to assure you by this opportunity That my friend ship for & attachment to your person and Character have been Regularly Increasing without the 
Least Interruption. I have now the honor to assure you that I am with the 
</p><p>
highest Esteem, Dear Sir your most 
</p><p>
assured friend & Humble Serv'
