<i>biograper's note</i><p>[Two days after the battle of Belmont, November 9th, General Halleck
supersedes General Fremont in command of the Department of Missouri.
General Grant's command is now changed from the District of
Southeastern Missouri to the District of Cairo and that of the mouths
of the Cumberland and the Tennessee. This is the command he refers to
here as the most important one in the department.]</p><hr>

Cairo, Illinois,<br>
November 27th, <a href="/results.php?year=1861">1861</a>.

DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
Your letter enclosed with a shawl to Julia is just received.
</p><p>
In regard to your stricture about my not writing I think that you have
no cause of complaint. My time is all taken up with public duties.
</p><p>
Your statement of prices at which you proposed furnishing harness was
forwarded to Maj. Allen as soon as received and I directed Lagow, who
received the letter enclosing it, to inform you of the fact. He did so
at once.
</p><p>
I cannot take an active part in securing contracts. If I were not in
the army I should do so, but situated as I am it is necessary both to
my efficiency for the public good and my own reputation that I should
keep clear of Government contracts.
</p><p>
I do not write you about plans, or the necessity of what has been done
or what is doing because I am opposed to publicity in these matters.
Then too you are very much disposed to criticise unfavorably from
information received through the public press, a portion of which I am
sorry to see can look at nothing favorably that does not look to a war
upon slavery. My inclination is to whip the rebellion into submission,
preserving all constitutional rights. If it cannot be whipped in any
other way than through a war against slavery, let it come to that
legitimately. If it is necessary that slavery should fall that the
Republic may continue its existence, let slavery go. But that portion
of the press that advocates the beginning of such a war now, are as
great enemies to their country as if they were open and avowed
secessionists.[1]
</p><p>
There is a desire upon the part of people who stay securely at home to
read in the morning papers, at their breakfast, startling reports of
battles fought. They cannot understand why troops are kept inactive
for weeks or even months. They do not understand that men have to be
disciplined, arms made, transportation and provisions provided. I am
very tired of the course pursued by a portion of the Union press.
</p><p>
Julia left last Saturday for St. Louis where she will probably spend a
couple of weeks and return here should I still remain. It costs
nothing for her to go there, and it may be the last opportunity she
will have of visiting her father. From here she will go to Covington,
and spend a week or two before going back to Galena.
</p><p>
It was my bay horse (cost me $140) that was shot. I also lost the
little pony, my fine saddle and bridle, and the common one. What I
lost cost about $250. My saddle cloth which was about half the cost of
the whole, I left at home.
</p><p>
I try to write home about once in two weeks and think I keep it up
pretty well. I wrote to you directly after the battle of Belmont, and
Lagow and Julia have each written since.
</p><p>
Give my love to all at home. I am very glad to get letters from home
and will write as often as I can. I am somewhat troubled lest I lose
my command here, though I believe my administration has given general
satisfaction not only to those over me but to all concerned. This is
the most important command within the department however, and will
probably be given to the senior officer next to <a href="/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="co-worker met">General Halleck</a>
himself.
</p><p>
There are not so many brigadier generals in the army as there are
brigades, and as to divisions they are nearly all commanded by
brigadiers.
</p><p>
Yours,
</p>
ULYSSES.

<p>[Footnote 1: Grant's conviction that the essential purpose of the
    war was not the abolition of slavery as an end in itself, but the
    preservation of the Union at all costs was identical with that of
    Lincoln. This letter can properly be compared with the well-known
    letter written by Lincoln to Greeley on the third of August,
    <a href="/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>, in which Lincoln says: "My paramount object in this
    struggle is to save the Union, and it is not either to save or to
    destroy slavery." Lincoln understood that the task accepted by
    him as President as the leader in the contest for national
    existence made the maintenance of the Union his chief, if not for
    the time being his only responsibility. He had, however, placed
    himself on record in many utterances to the effect that if the
    republic were to be preserved, slavery must be, in the first
    place, restricted, and finally destroyed. It is probable that in
    this matter Grant did not go so far as Lincoln. In any case, in
    common with the President, he devoted himself simply to the duty
    immediately before him.]</p><hr>
