Dearest Ellen:--We are now at anchor about five miles below Wilmington. We have come this far on our voyage without meeting with anything particularly strange or surprising, except a capsized schooner and half a dozen men just above water floating upon her.

It is a magnificent moonlight evening. While our passengers are enjoying a dance aboard the steamer which tows us, I embrace the opportunity of writing to her I love. I have just had a pleasant promenade on the deck of the steamboat, but I can tell you what would have made it much pleasanter--your company. But I must not complain. I knew the cost and have hazarded everything. Your miniature proves a great source of comfort. I have thought of you very often--I may say almost constantly. Your letter breathes the true spirit and could I doubt the sincerity of your affection, I could also doubt that the world is in existence. I can assure you that while remembrance lasts, you will not be forgotten.
</p><p>
I called at your sister's and obtained the salve and rags of which you spoke. They seemed as anxious to fit me out as if I had been their brother and for this kindness I have you wholly to thank. Return them my deepest gratitude.

I presume the Guards made a stir in West Chester this afternoon; I am sorry I could not spend the day with them, but I shall remember that I sailed for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> on the Fourth of July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>, leaving all that's near and dear for yellow gold. The steamboat will leave us in the morning, so this will be the last letter you are likely to receive from me for some months, as we do not expect to stop before we reach Valparaiso on the western coast of South America.

Since I have parted with my friends, I have been in very good spirits and felt very well. Our bread is as hard as a brickbat and about as palatable but I made a very good breakfast on it notwithstanding. It is navy bread, made of rye flour and bran. The only thing I dread is seasickness and that will be fearful.
</p><p>
I have just been on deck to participate in the Captain's treat--brandy and cheese--and now my friends are making merry. We have four violins on board besides quite a number of other musical instruments, so we will not suffer for want of harmony of sound.

You told me you had been walking with Prizer and said you knew I would think no harm of that. I can answer and assure you that I would consider myself very ungenerous and selfish indeed if I had any objections to your walking with him or any other respectable person after having left you to be gone two or three years. It pains me to know you think me so selfish. Remember that it will be my pleasure to know that you are happy and enjoying yourself and it would not be reasonable to suppose you could do that if shut up in the house and not permitted to see any one. Try to make yourself as happy as possible until my return and then it will be my happiness to study yours. And what you have said to me in regard to care of health, apply to yourself, for health, after all, is the greatest of all blessings.

I am going ashore at New Castle and will take this with me. I must bid you farewell, with the promise that I will write at the first opportunity. I remain,
</p><p>
As ever yours,
</p><p>
