I received a letter from you by Sewall and had written you just before. I have nothing new to communicate but I thought it was best to let you know that Sewall left last night in the good schooner Emma, bound for Bangor; so you may look for him in the course of the winter. He exhibited a most depraved mind while he was here. He was more pleased with the horse race at the race course down on the Island, than anything he saw. He visited all the theatres, from the Chatham and Mose up to the Astor Place Opera House, where we saw Macready. Macready is the best actor on the stage, so the criticks say. I like him much better than Forrest. He played Othello the night we saw him, which is my favorite
tragedy. I attended the theatre five times in one fortnight on account of Henry Darling and Sewall and I have got enough and have sworn off for a fortnight. I think I shall hold out all winter.

I have been very busy for a fortnight past but have not made much. It is more trouble to sell a cargo of lumber than it is worth. We have had a cargo from Florida that the owner has drawn on us at sight for the money, before the lumber was sold. We raised the money, however, and our credit is good yet, but you must not be surprised to hear of our failure at any time.

I have sent a barrel of walnuts to Father. He will not probably want the whole and you are the next of kin. I should like to spend Thanksgiving at home but can't very well.
