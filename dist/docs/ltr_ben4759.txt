DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
At length after much Delay and Difficulty I have been able 
to obtain your Telescope, that was made by Mr. Short before 
his Death. His brother who succeeds in the Business has 
fitted it up and compleated it. He has followed the Business 
many Years at Edinburgh, is reckoned very able, and therefore I hope every thing will be found right ; but, as it is only 
just finished, I have no time left to get any philosophical or 
astronomical Friends to examine it, as I intended, the Ship 
being on the Point of sailing, and a future Opportunity uncertain. Enclosed is his Direction-Paper for opening and 
fixing it. 
</p><p>
I have not yet got the Bill of the Price. It is to be made 
from the deceased Mr. Short's ' Book of Memorandums 
of Orders, in which he enter' d this Order of ours and as it is 
supposed, the Price. I do not remember, it is so long since, 
whether it was ^100, or 100 Guineas ; and the Book is in the 
Hands of the Executors as I understand. When I have the 
Account, I shall pay it as I did Bird's for the Transit Instrument, which was 40 Guineas, and then shall apply for the 
whole to Mr. Mauduit. 2 By the way, I wonder that I have 
not heard from you of the Receipt of that Instrument, which 
went from hence in September by Captain Watt. I hope it 
got safe to hand and gave Satisfaction. The Ship was the 
same that Mr. Rogers went in, who I hear is arriv'd ; and by 
him too I sent the Philosophical Transactions, with a Number of Copies of your Paper as printed separately. But I 
have no Letter from you since that by the young Gentleman 
you recommended to me, Grandson to Sir W Pepperell, 
which I think was dated about the Beginning of October, 
when you could not have received them. 
</p><p>
By a late Ship, I sent your College l a Copy of the new Edition of my Philosophical Papers; and others, I think, for 
yourself and for <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a>. I should apologize to you 
for inserting therein some part of our Correspondence without first obtaining your Permission; but, as <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a> 
had favoured me with his Consent for what related to 
him, I ventur'd to rely upon your Good-Nature, as to what 
related to you, and I hope you will forgive me. 
</p><p>
I have got from Mr. Ellicot the Glasses, &c. of the long 
Galilean Telescope, which he presents to your College. I 
put them into the Hands of Mr. Nairne, the Optician, to 
examine and put them in Order. I thought to have sent them 
by this Ship, but am disappointed. They shall go by the 
next, if possible. 
</p><p>
There is nothing new here in the philosophical Way at 
present. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere Esteem, I am, Dear Sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. There is no Prospect of getting the Duty acts 
repeaPd this Session, if ever. Your steady Resolutions to 
consume no more British Goods may possibly, if persisted in have a good Effect another Year. I apprehend the Parliamentary Resolves and Address will tend to widen the 
Breach. Inclos'd I send you Gov r Pownall's Speech against 
those Resolves ; his name is not to be mentioned. He appears 
to me a hearty Friend to America, tho' I find he is suspected 
by some on account of his Connections.
