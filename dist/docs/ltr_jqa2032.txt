DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I received this morning your favor of the 3d instant. We 
still hold tolerably firm to the text of neutrality, though we 
have our partialities for the French, and are much irritated 
against the British. This is natural enough, and indeed, 
although we have some grounds of complaint against both 
with respect to their treatment of our commerce in their 
present contest, yet it is not to be denied that the general 
disposition of the French ruling powers has been constantly 
favorable to us, and that the British government, acrimonious, jealous and under the guise of fair pretensions, deeply 
malignant. The new instructions of the 8th of January 
have an appearance less hostile than those under which 
most of our vessels in the West Indies have been condemned, and if we can labor through another summer without a war, 
I hope the affairs of Europe will assume a milder aspect. 
The unprecedented exertions which have convulsed that 
quarter of the globe are surely too violent for duration. 
The combined powers have made so little impression upon 
France, and have already suffered so severely, that I think 
they cannot hold out much longer. They must, I think, 
patch up a peace upon such terms as they can ; but how they 
can exist under their present governments, or any other, 
with a nation of fanatical atheists, all warriors, in the midst 
of them, is indeed a problem which nothing but time can 
solve.

Our election of Governor took place last Monday. The 
numerous candidates of whom everybody talked, and for 
whom nobody intended to vote, had silently sunk into oblivion, and Judge Gushing alone remained to be opposed to 
the claimant by succession. 11 In this town uncommon pains were taken by both parties. There were 500 votes more 
than have ever been given upon any former election. Mr. 
Adams had 1400, and Judge Gushing 900. Our federalists 
droop the head and think all is lost. They know not so 
much of the human heart, or of the American character as 
you do. You told me what the event of the election would 
be last October, and I then thought your "oracle plus sur que celui de Chalcas." A friend of mine who lives in the country, by the name of Townsend, a sensible man and a warm 
Federalist, has repeatedly told me previous to the election, 
that he did not think the prophet would even have votes 
enough to make him a candidate for the election. Why? 
Because he is superannuated and antifederal. I have so 
often told him that I believed the choice of the people 
would be for this doting antifederalist. Since the election 
he writes me "I give you joy of the prospect of your old 
friend's being elected Governor. The votes went very 
different from what I expected. I was not sufficiently acquainted with the moral habits of the people. The main argument of his being a scapegoat of seventy-five had more 
weight than I had expected." There will probably be no 
choice of Lieutenant Governor by the people. Mr. Adams's 
partisans in this town voted for Mr. Gill. He will probably 
be the highest candidate. 
</p><p>
My business I can hope will increase. But as it is I 
have no disposition to complain. It gives me bread and 
I find myself so well satisfied with that, that my greatest ap 
prehension is of growing indolent and listless. It is hardly 
possible to obtain a conquest over the ambitious principle 
without subduing in some measure that of an honorable 
activity. You recommend to me to attend the town meetings and make speeches ; to meet with caucuses and join 
political clubs. But I am afraid of all these things. They 
might make me a better politician, and give me an earlier 
chance of appearing as a public man ; but that would throw 
me completely in the power of the people, and all my future 
life would be a life of dependence. I had rather continue 
some time longer in obscurity, and make some provision for 
fortune, before I sally out in quest of fame or of public 
honors. . . .
