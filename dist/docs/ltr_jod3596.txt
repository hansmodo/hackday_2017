MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is a common observation of old people, that as 
they advance in life, time appears to run off faster, 
and the year grows shorter. I cannot, I am sure, 
say the same of the time which has passed of late. 
I took possession of this chamber on the eighth of 
this month, and the time has seemed at least as long 
to me, as any fifteen days of my whole life. Tedious 
days and lonesome nights ! I am weary of ye ! 
</p><p>
Enclosed is the address of the Senate and the President's reply. You will be pleased with both, but 
wry faces, and shrill voices enough will be seen and 
heard in the House, the cities arid in some places in 
the country. What do you make of the intelligence 
from France ? They seem to be weary of clubs, but 
as yet unable to do without them. The explosion of 
their powder works and men seems as desperate as 
dreadful. Dreadful, awful revenge, I expect, will be practised in a thousand ways ; and as revenge excites 
revenge, where will it stop ? They seem at present to 
be unable to confine their enemies, or to set them at 
liberty. Sin and death seem to have deserted the 
place where Milton saw them, and taken their abode 
in Paris. 
</p><p>
I did not expect any letter from you last week, be- 
cause of your visit to Haverhill, and I was not disappointed, but if I should not receive one this week I should be mortified. 
</p><p>
The spirit in the two Houses has hitherto appeared 
well disposed to support the government, but whether 
the House will venture to censure a great number of 
their constituents so freely as the President and Senate 
have done, I know not. <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Madison</a></a> and Mr. Scott 
upon the committee would not admit the clause into 
their report, and whether the House will insert it is 
not yet certain. An army of fifteen thousand militia 
so easily raised from four States only, to go upon 
such an enterprise ought to be a terrible phenomenon 
to anti-federal citizens as well as to insolent Britons. 
If our old stepmother continues to provoke us, till our 
patience is exhausted, she will soon see mischief to 
her dominions in America. But they will cost us 
infinitely more than they are worth. 
Adieu.
