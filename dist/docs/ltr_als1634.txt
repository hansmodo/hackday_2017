My esteemed friend,
</p><p>
The favored (letter) from you dated the 23rd of this month that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=als" rel="me">I</a> have the pleasure to answer gives me notice of the political situation of the Nation, as you observe things; but to my way of seeing and according to the news that from all parts I receive, I do not judge the cause of the nation to be in such bad shape, notwithstanding the ( ) that has been experienced by some, and the disloyalty observed in others. It is true that with the revolution one should not fall asleep, nor stop the course of action until concluding it, but the enemies are not as strong, and even when they still count on some resources and with the support that you indicate to me, they would succumb more quickly than they wanted under the enormous weight of the ( ) opinion sufficiently shown from every corner of the Republic, sustained by my army of valiant ones. Thus, the triumph ( ) will be lost.
</p><p>
I should attempt my march, with my division composed of seven hundred soldiers, to Huajuapan as soon as Coronel Leon takes possession of the general command of the State, and if my presence in that capital were necessary
[fold and smudge] to continue on with only my ( ).
</p><p>
After the armistice drawn up by order of the Government and you will have seen in the public papers, the great division of Calderon broke [torn] under the pretext that the ( ) troop was being corrupted. In this attitude we continue without stopping the firing day and night, when I had an encounter with her (the division) by my effort achieving some destruction that imposed sufficient fear on her. The following day I received an official letter from that leader, from which resulted the pact that you will see by the enclosed treatise: today in force ( ) this has (yielded) the part of the city that it occupied, and upon beginning its march some officials and troops have passed me; this, and the disgust in which they have left makes me believe that eight hundred men will not arrive at Puebla.
</p><p>
Do not fail to communicate with me whatever happens, procuring not to give me sparingly your esteemed letters, thus the knowledge will not be ( ) opportunely any (happening)
</p><p>
When we see each other, that I hope ( ) [torn] very soon, I will communicate to you some (details); and while I have this pleasure (dispose) of that which is unprofitable with sincerity ( )
</p>
