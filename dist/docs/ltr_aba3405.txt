I find, Sir, what I never doubted, that you are 
a gentleman of your word. I thank you for the 
agreeable proof which you have given me of it ; 
and, that I may not be wanting in punctuality, I have 
taken my pen to discharge the debt which I acknowledge is due to you.

Amongst the public edifices which are worthy 
of notice in this country, are several churches. 
I went, a few days since, to see three of the most 
celebrated in Paris. They are prodigious masses 
of stone buildings, and so surrounded by houses 
which are seven stories high, that the sun seldom 
enlightens them. I found them so cold and damp, 
that I could only give them a very hasty and transient survey. The architecture, the sculpture, the 
paintings, are beautiful indeed, and each of them 
would employ my pen for several pages, when the 
weather will permit me to take a more accurate 
and critical inspection of them. These churches 
are open every day, and at all times of the clay ; so 
that you never enter them without finding priests 
upon their knees, half a dozen at a time, and more 
at the hours of confession. All kinds of people and 
of all ages go in without ceremony, and regardless of 
each other ; fall upon their knees, ci'oss themselves, 
say their Pater-nosters and Ave -Marias silently 
and go out again without being noticed or even 
seen by the priests, whom I found always kneeling 
with their faces towards the altar. Round these 
churches, (for they have not pews and galleries as 
with us, chairs alone being made use of,) there are 
little boxes or closets about as large as a sentry-box, 
in which is a small grated window, which communicates with another closet of the same kind. One of 
them holds the person who is confessing, and the 
other the confessor, who places his ear at this window, hears the crime, absolves the transgressor, and 
very often makes an assignation for a repetition of 
the same crime, or perhaps a new one. T do not 
think this a breach of charity ; for can we suppose, 
that, of the many thousands whom the religion of 
the country obliges to celibacy, one quarter part of 
the number can find its influence sufficiently powerful to conquer those passions which nature has implanted in man, when the gratification of them will 
cost them only a few livres in confession ?

I was at the Church of St. Roch about ten o'clock 
in the morning, and, whilst I was there, about three 
hundred little boys came in from some charity seminary which belongs to that church. They had books 
in their hands. They followed each other in regular order, and fell upon their knees in rows like 
soldiers in rank and file. There might have 
been fifty other persons in the church at their 
devotion. Every thing was silent and solemn 
throughout this vast edifice. I was walking with a 
slow pace round it, when, all at once, the drear 
silence which reigned was suddenly broken by all 
these boys at one instant chanting with loud voices, 
which made the dome ring, and me start, for I had 
no apprehension of any sound. I have never been 
to any of these churches upon a Sunday. When the 
weather is warmer, I design it. But their churches 
seem rather calculated to damp devotion than excite it. I took such a cold there as I have not had 
since I have been in France. I have been several 
times to the chapel of the Dutch ambassador, and 
should go oftener if I could comprehend the discourses, which are all in French. I believe the 
American embassy is the only one to which chaplains are not allowed. Do Congress think that their 
ministers have no need of grace ? or that religion 
is not a necessary article for them ? Sunday will 
not feel so to me whilst I continue in this country. 
It is high holiday for all France.

We had a visit the other day from no less a personage than Abbe Thayer, in his habit, who has become a convert. His visit was to me, I suppose, for 
he was a perfect stranger to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>. He told 
us that he had spent a year at Rome, that he belonged to a seminary of St. Sulpice in Paris, that he 
never, knew what religion was, until his conversion, 
and that he designed to return to America in a year 
or two, to see if he could not convert his friends and 
acquaintance. After talking some time in this style, 
he began to question <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> if he believed the 
Bible, and to rail at Luther and Calvin; upon which 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> took him up pretty short, and told him 
that he was not going to make a father confessor of 
him, that his religion was a matter that he did not 
look upon himself accountable for to any one but 
his Maker, and that he did not choose to hear either 
Luther or Calvin treated in such a manner. Mr. 
Abbe took his leave after some time, without any 
invitation to repeat his visit.
