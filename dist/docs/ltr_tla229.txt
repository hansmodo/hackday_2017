<p> Dear Folks-
</p>
<p> Don’t get excited at the heading, it’s only temporary- I go back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawau" rel="tag">Tawau</a>- the fifth-just here to get some [unintelligible] for the job. This whole thing may blow up. Pete wrote a very sarcastic letter to the British Gov. officials about a week ago- told them that unless they changed their ways they could shove the whole thing where it would hurt most- so may get run out- I don’t care much or rather wouldn’t if I knew where I could make a living- we Pete and I also had a small set to the other day- tried to blame me for things which I had nothing to do with- meybee too much. Told him I was ready to go any old time and that I was not taking annothers blame, he cooled down but then meybee he will heat up again. It’s awfully hot here, much worse than Tawau.
</p>
<p> Hope you got the income tax report fixed ok. Can’t see how the income accountant could claim tax on what I earn in a foreign country, I am subject to the laws of the country in which I am working- the money you get is not salery It’s my own money and I have to spend 42 ½ cents to send every dollar to you. Further I am not required to make out a report until 3 mo. After I return to the U.S.
</p>
<p> I sure wish I could be there for the wedding- meybee I will- have never saw one of my kids married- tell <a href="results.php?tla=jwe" rel="sibling">John</a> I sure would like to see him- also <a href="results.php?tla=fme" rel="sibling">Frank</a>. Would also like to see my new <a href="results.php?tla=kje" rel="kin">G.D.</a> and <a href="results.php?tla=gae" rel="kin">the old one</a> as well, am afraid she will not remember Bapoo and of course she has grown so that I wouldn’t know her either. 
</p>
<p>I see an acct.  In paper here by a British Dr. that they have been able to trace so called chronic headaches to an allergy of some sort. Meybee that’s <a href="results.php?tla=ebe" rel="spouse">your</a> answer- wouldn’t cost much to check and find out.
<p> I’m not so well lately have to much on my mind I guess- meybee a little old also- say I ask’d once what we could sell the place for but no answer- why? Meybee we could trade them for something clear in San Diego. Sorry to hear that <a href="results.php?tla=jpe" rel="child">Parker</a> was only working part time, does the prospects look any better now? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid_Bergman" rel="tag">Bergman's</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041931/" rel="tag">picture</a> is showing here now- the critics say lousy- so do I. 
</p>
<p> Hope alls well</p>
