The air is very cold and piercing and the distant hills across the bay are covered with snow. Last evening it commenced raining and hailing and continued all night and this forenoon. In a tent a few feet distant from our own, a party of merry Englishmen were drinking, singing and revelling in drunkenness until near daylight, when they came to our tent, borrowed some matches, and insisted upon our drinking with them. They occasioned much merriment.

I have divided the money belonging to the section and found each member was entitled to $27 and while the others lost, I gained, on account of owning two shares, having purchased Mr. Huber's interest a few days previous for $20. This afternoon we purchased three tin pans at $2.50 each.

We were notified to remove our quarters off Uncle Sam's property. At noon today no one had complied with this request, and a company of armed soldiers were marched into camp and removed the tents and houses of several persons who would not otherwise comply. Resistance was expected, but all passed off quietly. It appears that the ground has been reserved, and has since been leased to several persons by the government, whose duty it is to put it in the possession of the said renters. We removed our tent off the forbidden ground and all appears to be right. I am nearly laid up by the poison, having caught it from the bushes where we cut our wood.

Today we had an Irishman with us who crossed the plains. He told us some marvelous stories about the route, and stated he would not return that way again for all the gold in California.
