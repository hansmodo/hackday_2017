Dear Mary
</p><p>
I send two jars whc. came to me filled with your nice pickles before I left home in Nov.
</p><p>
I kept one of them for Commencement and it has been most useful these last few days. I have not forgotten yr. very kind offer to have some currant jelly made for me (Page 2) & if you still find it entirely convenient, I will send you some any day you wish to have them, just for the pleasure of having some of yr. jelly whc. we know will be very nice. I still look forward to seeing you all soon!
