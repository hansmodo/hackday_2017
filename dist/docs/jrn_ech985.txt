The wind dead head against us for two days carried us back again to the latitude of the Horn. On Thursday a vessel that had been seen in the distance, came up to us about noon. It proved to be the John Parker of Boston. He told us they had a rough time of it round the Horn, and were now on short allowance of water. This is the same vessel we spoke when only about three weeks out; by this it will
be seen that we have not been beaten by anything we yet know of.

During a storm Saturday night our rudder again gave way and required some time to render it useful next morning. This morning the wind died away and as the sun rose, shedding forth his welcome rays, the sea was as calm and smooth as a pretty maiden's cheek. Soon after, a fair wind sprung up and towards evening increased to a gale accompanied by heavy rain, rendering it necessary for us to lay to or run the risk of again losing our rudder. The early part of the day was the most agreeable we had had for about four weeks, and the decks were dry for the first time during that period.

All hands have again been engaged catching water with tin cup or bottle, off every spar and rope, wherever a drop would run down. But very little of the water caught in this manner is fit for drinking, as it is rendered somewhat brackish from the spray which is continually dashing over the rigging. However, it answers for culinary purposes. Today I stood nearly an hour in the rain and cold until my fingers were quite benumbed, holding a tin cup to catch water as it dripped off one of the small boats. This was free from salt and made a good cup of chocolate. Since our short allowance of water commenced, we have been furnished with enough wheat flour to make four biscuits a day, but this is now stopped. We will get that amount of wheat flour only once a week. This renders it pretty hard to get along on a quart of water, as fresh bread required less water than anything else and it did not create a thirst as most other provisions do, especially our beef and pork. But I shall get along handsomely as I can trade a pint of water for two biscuits per day with one of the upper cabin passengers.

Last evening Mrs. H. and Mr. Marvin commenced playing dominoes. This being contrary to the wishes of the passengers, a committee was appointed to wait on the Captain and request him to have it stopped. The Captain repaired below and it was immediately discontinued. This is not the first time the same parties have outraged public opinion by playing games on Sunday evening.

At noon today we had a distant view of Cape Pillar, the northwesternmost point of Tierra del Fuego.
