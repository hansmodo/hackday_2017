While praying for the return of those who have fought so nobly for us, how I have dreaded their 
first days at home! Since the boys died, I have constantly thought of what pain it would bring to see 
their comrades return without them to see families reunited, and know that ours never could be again, 
save in heaven. Last Saturday, the 29th of April, seven hundred and fifty paroled Louisianians from 
Lee's army were brought here the sole survivors of ten regiments who left four years ago so full of 
hope and determination. On the 29th of April, <a href='/results.php?year=1861'>1861</a>, George left <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> with his regiment. On the fourth anniversary of that day, they came back; but George and Gibbes have long been lying in their graves, . . .
