dies Only " on Saturday. Many more persons there than at any of these luncheons which we have gone to before. 
Gumbo, ducks and olives, chickens in jelly, oysters, lettuce salad, chocolate cream, jelly cake, claret, champagne, etc., 
were the good things set before us.

To-day, for a pair of forlorn shoes I have paid $85. Colonel Ives drew my husband's pay for me. I sent Lawrence for it (Mr. Chesnut ordered him back to us; we needed a man servant here). Colonel Ives wrote that he was 
amazed I should be willing to trust a darky with that great bundle of money, but it came safely. Mr. Petigru says you 
take your money to market in the market basket, and bring home what you buy in your pocket-book.
