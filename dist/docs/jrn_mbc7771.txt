<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='6'>6th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. To-day came a godsend. Even a small piece of bread and the molasses had become things of the 
past. My larder was empty, when a tall mulatto woman brought a tray covered by a huge white serviette. Ellen 
ushered her in with a flourish, saying, " Mrs. McDaniers maid. The maid set down the tray upon my bare table, 
and uncovered it with conscious pride. There were fowls ready for roasting, sausages, butter, bread, eggs, and preserves. I was dumb with delight. After silent thanks to heaven my powers of speech returned, and I exhausted my 
self in messages of gratitude to Mrs. McDaniel.

" Missis, you oughtn't to let her see how glad you was," said Ellen. " It was a lettin of yo sef down."

Mrs. Glover gave me some yarn, and I bought five dozen eggs with it from a wagon eggs for Lent. To show that I 
have faith yet in humanity, I paid in advance in yarn for something to eat, which they promised to bring to-morrow. 
Had they rated their eggs at $100 a dozen in " Confederick money, I would have paid it as readily as $10. But 
I haggle in yarn for the millionth part of a thread.

Two weeks have passed and the rumors from Columbia are still of the vaguest. No letter has come from there, no 
direct message, or messenger. " My God! " cried Dr. Frank Miles, " but it is strange. Can it be anything so 
dreadful they dare not tell us? Dr. St. Julien Ravenel has grown pale and haggard with care. His wife and children were left there.

Dr. Brumby has at last been coaxed into selling me enough leather for the making of a pair of shoes, else I 
should have had to give up walking. He knew my father well. He intimated that in some way my father helped him 
through college. His own money had not sufficed, and so William C. Preston and my father advanced funds sufficient 
to let him be graduated. Then my uncle, Charles Miller, married his aunt. I listened in ra*pture, for all this tended 
to leniency in the leather business, and I bore off the leather gladly. When asked for Confederate money in trade I 
never stop to bargain. I give them $20 or $50 cheerfully for anything either sum.
