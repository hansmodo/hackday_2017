<p><i>[Biogapher's Note: 
This autumn my sister Mildred paid a visit to our cousins, Mr. and
Mrs. George Golsborough, living at Ashby, near Easton, on the Eastern
Shore of Maryland.  She remained away there and elsewhere for several
months.  My father's letters to her, many of which have been preserved,
are most interesting.  They show very plainly many beautiful phases
of his noble character and disposition: ]</i>

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mil" rel="child met">My Precious Life:</a>  I was very glad to receive your letter of the 15th
inst., and to learn that you were well and happy.  May you be always
as much so as is consistent with your welfare here and hereafter, is
my daily prayer.  I was much pleased, too, that, while enjoying the
kindness of your friends, we were not forgotten.  Experience will teach
you that, notwithstanding all appearances to the contrary, you will
never receive such a love as is felt for you by your father and mother.
That lives through absence, difficulties, and times.  Your own feelings
will teach you how it should be returned and appreciated.  I want to
see you very much, and miss you at every turn, yet am glad of this
opportunity for you to be with those who, I know, will do all in their
power to give you pleasure.  I hope you will also find time to read
and improve your mind.  Read history, works of truth, not novels and
romances.  Get correct views of life, and learn to see the world in
its true light.  It will enable you to live pleasantly, to do good,
and, when summoned away, to leave without regret.  Your friends here
inquire constantly after you, and wish for your return.  Mrs. White
and Mrs. McElwee particularly regret your absence, and the former
sends especial thanks for your letter of remembrance.  We get on in
our usual way.  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=agl" rel="child met">Agnes</a> takes good care of us, and is very thoughtful
and attentive.  She has not great velocity, but is systematic and
quiet.  After to-day, the mornings will begin to lengthen a little,
and her trials to lessen.  It is very cold, the ground is covered with
six inches of snow, and the mountains, as far as the eye can reach in
every direction, elevate their white crests as monuments of winter.
This is the night for the supper for the repairs to the Episcopal
church.  Your mother and sisters are busy with their contributions.
It is to take place at the hotel, and your brother, cousins, and father
are to attend.  On Monday night (24th), the supper for the Presbyterian
church is to be held at their lecture-room.  They are to have music
and every attraction.  I hope both may be productive of good.  But you
know the Episcopalians are few in numbers and light in purse, and
must be resigned to small returns....  I must leave to your sisters
a description of these feasts, and also an account of the operation
of the Reading Club.  As far as I can judge, it is a great institution
for the discussion of apples and chestnuts, but is quite innocent of
the pleasures of literature.  It, however, brings the young people
together, and promotes sociability and conversation.  Our feline
companions are flourishing.  Young Baxter is growing in gracefulness
and favour, and gives cat-like evidences of future worth.  He possesses
the fashionable colour of 'moonlight on the water,' apparently a dingy
hue of the kitchen, and is strictly aristocratic in appearance and
conduct.  Tom, surnamed 'The Nipper,' from the manner in which he
slaughters our enemies, the rats and the mice, is admired for his
gravity and sobriety, as well as for his strict attention to the
pursuits of his race.  They both feel your absence sorely.  Traveller
and Custis are both well, and pursue their usual dignified gait and
habits, and are not led away by the frivolous entertainments of lectures
and concerts.  All send united love, and all wish for your return.
Remember me most kindly to Cousins Eleanor and George, John, Mary,
Ida, and all at 'Myrtle Grove,' and to other kind friends when you
meet them.  Mrs. Grady carried yesterday to Mr. Charles Kerr, in
Baltimore, a small package for you.  Be careful of your health, and
do not eat more than half the plum-puddings Cousin Eleanor has prepared
for Xmas.  I am glad to hear that you are fattening, and I hope you
will reach 125 lbs.  Think always of your father, who loves you dearly.

P.S., 22d.--Rob arrived last night with 'Lucy Long.'  He thinks it too bad you are away.  He has not seen you for two years.

<p> <i>[Biographer's Note: Baxter and Tom, the Nipper were Mildred's pets.  All of us had
a fondness for cats, inherited from my mother and her father, Mr.
Custis.  My father was very fond of them in his way and in their
place, and was kind to them and considerate of their feelings.  My
father was very fond of them in his way and in their place, and was
kind to them and considerate of their feelings.  My mother told of
his hearing one of the house-pets, possibly Baxter or the Nipper,
crying and lamenting under his window one stormy night.  The General
got out of bed, opened the window, and called pussy to come in.  The
window was so high that the animal could not jump up to it.  My father
then stepped softly across the room, took one of my mother's crutches,
and held it so far out of the window that he became wet from falling
rain; but he persuaded the cat to climb up along the crutch, and
into the window, before he thought of dry clothing fo himself.
