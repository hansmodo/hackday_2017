DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : I wrote you a few lines on yesterday. I have twice written to Mr. K. to 
have the C. stopped. Go and see him on the subject. I believe any more newspaper 
attacks would lay me low * * As influence has passed away from me with my husband, my slightest act is misinterpreted. Time 
makes all things right. I am positively suffering for a decent dress. I see Mr. A. and some 
recent visitors eyeing my clothing askance. * Do send my black merino dress to me very soon ; 
I must dress better in the future. I tremble at the bill that B. & K. may send me, I am so illy 
prepared to meet any expense. All my articles not sold must be sent to me. I leave this place 
early in the spring ; had you better not go with me and share my fortunes, for a year or more? 
* * Write. 
</p><p>
Yours, etc.,<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mtl" rel="me">M. L.</a>
