Sir. 
</p><p>
I had the honor to inform you, on my return from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, of what passed there relative to the 
means of procuring the numerous supplies requisite 
in my department for the ensuing campaign ; and 
was unhappy that no prospect was presented of my 
obtaining a single shilling for that end. As the only 
alternative, therefore, I submitted to your Excellency's judgment the expediency of calling on the several States to furnish camp equipage for their own 
troops respectively; which proposal you was pleased 
to approve. This also corresponds with the articles 
of Confederation, wherein it is declared (article nine), 
that Congress shall make requisitions from each State 
for its quota of troops, which requisition shall be 
binding; and thereupon the Legislature of each State shall appoint the regimental officers, raise the men, 
and clothe, arm, and equip them in a soldier-like 
manner, at the expense of the United States. 
</p><p>
I therefore now beg leave to lay before your Excellency the inclosed estimates of tents, knapsacks, 
and haversacks requisite for the troops of the four 
New England States. If in this mode these can be 
supplied, the general provision made and making will 
be adequate to the demands of the other troops composing the main army. In these estimates I have 
omitted camp-kettles, because they are not to be procured in the Eastern States, and I hope to obtain 
them from Pennsylvania. Canteens are making in 
Massachusetts for the whole main army. 
</p><p>
I have made the estimates in detail, that, by inspection only, your Excellency might judge of the 
propriety of the proposed allowances of camp equipage. I thought, too, that in this form they would 
be more satisfactory to the States themselves than 
a general demand. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
