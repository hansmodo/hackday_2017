MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I have lately made a Journey of a Fortnight, to Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, and Manchester, and returned only in 
time to be at Court on the King's Birthday, which was yesterday. The Joy was in a fair way of being doubled on the same 
Day, for the Queen was deliver' d early this Morning of another Prince, the eighth Child, there being now six Princes 
and two Princesses, all lovely Children. The Prince of 
Wales & the Bishop of Oszabrug appear'd yesterday for 
the first time in the Drawingroom, and gave great Pleasure 
by their sensible, manly Behaviour. My Journey has been 
of use to my Health, the Air and Exercise have given me 
fresh Spirits, and I feel now exceeding well, Thanks to God. 
</p><p>
I wrote to you lately, and have received no Line from you 
by Capt. Sparks who is arrived. I suppose you have written 
by Falconer, who is not yet heard of. My love to our Children and Grandson. I am as ever, your affectionate husband, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
