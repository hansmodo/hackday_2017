Dear Brother : . . . The greatest difficulty in the problem now before the country is not to conquer but so 
conquer as to impress upon the real men of the South a 
respect for their conquerors. If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> be taken, and 
the army move on South the vindictive feeling left behind would again close the River. And here in Missouri 
it would be easy to take Jefferson City, Lexington, and 
any other point, but the moment they are left to themselves the people would resume their hatred. It is for 
this reason that I deem Kegulars the only species of 
force that should be used for invasion. I take it for 
granted that Virginia will be attacked with great force 
this summer, and that the great problem of the war 
Mississippi will be reserved for the next winter. . . .

In the war on which we are now entering paper soldiers won't do. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> is naturally a superior man 
and has had the finest opportunities in Mexico and 
Europe. Even his juniors admit his qualifications.

Yours affectionately,
