<p> Dearest JP,
<p> &#8220;Happy New Year Darling&#8221;, and the very best wishes always. Course it&#8217;s late but the spirit is with me now- only 4 hours to go here and the new year will be a babe with us. Here&#8217;s hoping for the best ever and much better than this past one. 
<p> Received your letter today and now it&#8217;s my turn to ask what power you&#8217;ve got? Gosh, I would have been so disappointed for no good reason if I hadn&#8217;t gotten it- and now I&#8217;m so happy!
<p> So far I&#8217;m not doing anything tonight. Work tomorrow and I&#8217;m too tired just to me going out with nothing special in mind. Think I&#8217;ll hit the hay and save myself for when it isn&#8217;t too darned jammed everywhere. For it is pretty jammed anyway let alone New Year&#8217;s Eve, even with plenty of people with my own ideas. Guess last week just about did me up. 
<p> I&#8217;m very sorry your package from me to you did not arrive in time for Christmas .If you don&#8217;t get it soon be sure to let me know and I&#8217;ll send something in it&#8217;s place. Should I tell you? No, I&#8217;ll be mean about it.
<p> Say, I do hope you can forgive me for not waiting to open yours up. I had a very special reason for not telling you, and had already opened it the day before I got your letter telling me not to, or really I might have held off longer! Hope you don&#8217;t blame me too much, and I do want you to know that I felt very healish writing and not thanking you, but wanted to wait till Christmas to do it! Bet you think women are damned queer!
<p> I am so elated for today quite a few in my office got pay raises so I&#8217;m not in such a bad place after all. Gosh, I sure hope I get one some day and I&#8217;m sure working for it! Guess I&#8217;ll work on Sundays quite a bit for a while now too- might help a lot! Nothing like making yourself noticed you know!
<p> Jeepers, I just finished getting packages yesterday! Never had any idea I would get so much for Christmas but yours of course was the tops! Topped them all- and you really shouldn&#8217;t have sent me such a lovely present. Do you know what people say? &#8220;He must think an awful lot of you!&#8221; And then I&#8217;m so proud. Of course, Freddie said, &#8220;kidding me, that you were a sucker.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t mean it though, but thinks you are very unusual and you are! Thanks Again!
<p> It&#8217;s grand news about Stalingrad today isn&#8217;t it? They certainly have done a swell job I must say. Never thought they would be able to for a while there but it just goes to show you how little those of us not in the know know- about it all.
 <p> Went to see &#8220;Now Voyage&#8221; with Bette Davis Monday night. It was extremely good - at least I thought so, and I really think she should get the Academy Award for her performance. If you get a chance see it. I even shed a tear, Oh my!
<p> Well, I guess this will be all for this year now. Heaps of luck for this coming one.
<p> Lovingly, Ruth


<p> PS- it&#8217;s a wallet!
