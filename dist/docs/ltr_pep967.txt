Dear Friend:--A long time has elapsed since I last wrote to you. I have been participating in exciting times, in the midst of a political campaign in Pennsylvania. I have been electioneering, more or less, for the last two months.
</p><p>
I ought to have written some weeks since, but I wanted to wait and give you the result of the County Convention. On Tuesday last, Henry S. Evans was
nominated as the Whig candidate for the office of State Senator, on the 12th ballot, after one of the hardest contests man ever passed through. He had to fight his way inch by inch against powerful opposition. No stone was left unturned. I worked long, hard and faithfully for Mr. Evans. He will certainly be elected. We expect to re-elect Gov. Johnston. A few days ago Johnston visited West Chester, and addressed the people. Tomorrow Col. Bigler, his opponent, will pay us a visit, and address the multitude. This is a novel feature in Pennsylvania politics, and will benefit the Whig cause.
</p><p>
On the Locofoco side our mutual friend, Capt. Apple, has been nominated for Treasurer. The Captain will run well, but I think cannot be elected. I am in a tight place. I probably will vote for him as a personal compliment--but not to elect him.
</p><p>
I have been enjoying myself. I went to Camp Meeting at Pughtown. There was a large turn-out. Mr. Evans went with me to Camp--but not to be spiritually benefited. There was also electioneering to be done there.
</p><p>
In this region of country, we have had no rain for four months past, of any moment. Between West Chester and the Brandywine every particle of grass is dried up, and the country is parched, like winter, or even worse than winter. This morning it commenced raining, but enough rain did not fall to lay the dust, and the sun is again shining.
</p><p>
Jeff is getting along quite well with Sam'l Evans. Sam'l is full of fun, and as big a devil as ever. The editor will soon be blessed with another little responsibility. He is great at this business.
</p><p>
The ladies--the sun of attraction to some young men--I think want a little more courting and hugging. But to hug one, and neglect the others, is like taking a single grain of sand from the seashore, as the commencement to remove the whole mass. You make no perceptible effect.
</p><p>
I must stop and pay a visit at Mr. Apple's. Enclosed you will find a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a>. All hands send their warm regards.
</p><p>
Your old friend,
</p><p>
