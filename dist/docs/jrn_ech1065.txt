I lay on deck again last night, but slept very little. During the night a passenger, a middle-aged man, died and was consigned to the deep. This morning another old gentleman from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, died and was also consigned to the watery elements. Some think it cholera, and many of its symptoms certainly favor that opinion. Distance 209 miles.
