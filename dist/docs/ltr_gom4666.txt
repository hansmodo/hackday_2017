Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received your letter of yesterday, and it gives 
me much pleasure to be able to congratulate you upon your 
nomination, at the same time that I thank you for the friendly 
sentiments you do me the honor to express for the United 
States, as well on your own part, as on that of the French nation. The good will of the United States is by no means 
equivocal, and my personal attachment to France is of long 
standing, and sincere. I shall therefore feel double pleasure, 
whenever opportunities occur for giving new strength to the 
bonds which unite the two nations. I most ardently desire, 
that nothing may disturb the harmony subsisting between 
them. 
</p><p>
Permit me, Sir, at this time, to renew to you my solicitations respecting the decree of the Convention of May 28th. 
I learn with satisfaction the daily arrival of wheat and flour, 
sent to you from America, but I feel some uneasiness respecting that which has not yet arrived. Indeed, how can the enemies of France be prevented from following, with regard to 
us, the example she has set them, and especially England, 
who, not being restrained by the faith of treaties, (since we 
have made none with her,) will follow no impulse but that of 
her own interests. And how can we complain of it, after the 
marked preference we have given to France, and the decree 
of the 9th of May ? 
</p><p>
I say nothing to you, Sir, of the impression which this decree will necessarily produce in America. I would rather that 
such considerations should be presented to you, by your own 
reflections, than in consequence of mine. But it is of moment 
that the Convention should come to a definitive decision, be 
cause this delay, leaving the decree in force, exposes you to 
all the inconveniences which must result from it, and without 
any advantage. I ought moreover to observe to you that it 
will be very difficult, and perhaps impossible, to prevent your 
privateers from committing illegal and outrageous acts, as long 
as they are permitted to bring into your ports all the American vessels laden with eatables for countries at war with 
France. I receive many complaints to this effect, and often 
what was destined for another port is brought into a French 
one, which is the cause of great inconveniences. I have the 
honor to be, 
</p><p>
