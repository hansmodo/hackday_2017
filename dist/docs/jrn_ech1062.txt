Sunday night the steamship Golden Gate arrived in the bay and anchored close by us. Early next morning, one of the guns aboard our ship was fired, warning all hands to be aboard, and we took our departure and were soon out at sea. About one o'clock Monday night, the Golden Gate came up alongside of us, and soon left us in her wake. We sailed in sight of land, the coast appearing less rugged than further north.

I have been sleeping on a bench on deck. Last night was hot and sultry, with a light wind offshore. I was
very seasick, but feel better. Collections have been made to enable several passengers who came aboard in ill health to continue their journey home.
