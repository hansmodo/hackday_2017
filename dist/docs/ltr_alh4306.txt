Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In my passage through the Jerseys, and since my 
arrival here, I have taken particular pains to discover 
the public sentiment; and I am more and more convinced that this is the critical opportunity for establishing the prosperity of this country on a solid 
foundation. I have conversed with men of information, not only of this city, but from different parts of 
the State ; and they agree that there has been an 
astonishing revolution for the better in the minds of 
the people. 
</p><p>
The prevailing apprehension among thinking men 
is, that the Convention, from the fear of shocking the 
popular opinion, will not go far enough. They seem 
to be convinced, that a strong, well-mounted Government, will better suit the popular palate, than one of 
a different complexion. Men in office are, indeed, 
taking all possible pains to give an unfavorable impression of the Convention ; but the current seems to 
be moving strongly the other way. A plain, but sensible man, in a conversation I had with him yesterday, expressed himself nearly in this manner ; â€” The 
people begin to be convinced that "their excellent 
form of Government," as they have been used to call 
it, will not answer their purpose, and that they must 
substitute something not very remote from that which 
they have lately quitted. 
</p><p>
These appearances, though they will not warrant 
a conclusion that the people are yet ripe for such a 
plan as I advocate, yet serve to prove that there is 
no reason to despair of their adopting one equally 
energetic, if the Convention should think proper to 
propose it. They serve to prove, that we ought not 
to allow too much weight to objections drawn from 
the supposed repugnance of the people to an efficient 
Constitution. I confess, I am more and more inclined 
to believe, that former habits of thinking are regaining their influence with more rapidity than is generally imagined. 
</p><p>
Not having compared ideas with you. Sir, I cannot 
judge how far our sentiments agree ; but, as I persuade myself, the genuineness of my representations 
will receive credit with you. My anxiety for the 
event of the deliberations of the Convention, induces 
me to make this communication of what appears to 
be the tendency of the public mind. I own to you, 
Sir, that I am seriously and deeply distressed at the 
aspect of the counsels, which prevailed when I left 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I fear that we shall let slip the golden 
opportunity of rescuing the American Empire from 
disunion, anarchy, and misery. No motley or feeble 
measure can answer the end, or will finally receive 
the public support. Decision is true wisdom, and 
will not be less reputable to the Convention, than 
salutary to the community. 
</p><p>
I shall of necessity remain here ten or twelve days. 
If I have reason to believe that my attendance at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will not be mere waste of time, I shall, 
after that period, rejoin the Convention.
