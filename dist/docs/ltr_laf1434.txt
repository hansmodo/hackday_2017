TO MADAME DE LAFAYETTE.

If thirty opportunities were to present themselves at once, my dearest
love, you may rest assured that I would write thirty letters; and that,
if you do not receive any news from me, I have nothing, at least, to
reproach myself with. This letter will be accompanied by others, saying
nearly the same things, and having nearly the same date; but accidents
are unfortunately very common, and by this means, some letters may
reach you safely. Respecting your own, my love, I prefer accusing fate,
the waves, Lord Howe, and the devil, to suspecting you for one moment
of negligence. I am convinced that you will not allow a single
opportunity to escape of writing to me; but I should feel, if possible,
still more so, if I could only hope that you knew the degree of
happiness your letters give me. I love you more ardently than ever, and
repeated assurances of your affection are absolutely necessary to my
repose, and to that species of felicity which I can enjoy whilst
separated from all I love most fondly--if, however, the word "felicity"
can be applied to my melancholy, exiled state. Endeavour to afford me
some consolation, and neglect no opportunity of writing to me. Millions
of ages have elapsed since I have received a line from any one. This
complete ignorance of the situation of all those who are most dear to
me, is, indeed, a dreadful calamity: I have, however, some reason to
believe that it cannot last for ever; the scene will soon become
interesting; France must take some decisive part, and vessels will then
arrive with letters. I can give you no news at present; we are all in a
state of repose, and are waiting with impatience for the opening
campaign to awaken us from our stupor. In my other letters, I mentioned
my journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, and my visit to an assembly of savages. I am
expecting some good Iroquois who have promised to rejoin me here.
Either after, or before receiving this letter, Madame d'Ayen, the
viscountess, and my grandfather, will receive letters by an
opportunity which, I believe, is more secure than the one I am now
writing by; I have written a longer letter to you also at the same
time. I write an immense number of epistles; God grant that they may
arrive! Present my affectionate respects to your mother, and my
grandfather; embrace a thousand times the viscountess and my sisters;
recall me to the remembrance of the Countess Auguste, Madame de Fronsac, and all your and my friends. Embrace a thousand times our
dearest family. When shall I be able to assure you, my dearest life,
that I love you better than any other person in the world, and that I
shall love you as long as I live? Adieu; I only look upon this letter
as a note.

Present my respects to the Marshal de Noailles, and tell him that I
have sent him some trees from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>; but I will send him others also
at various times, that I may feel certain of his receiving a few of
them. When you present my compliments to my acquaintance, do not forget
the Chevalier de Chastellux.
