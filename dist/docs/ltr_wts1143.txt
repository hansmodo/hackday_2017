Dear Brother : You will have heard of our attack on 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> and failure to succeed. The place is too 
strong, and without the co-operation of a large army 
coming from the interior it is impracticable. Innumerable batteries prevent the approach of gun boats to the 
city or to the first bluff up the Yazoo, and the only 
landing between is on an insular space of low boggy 
ground, with innumerable bayous or deep sloughs. I 
did all that was possible to reach the main land, but 
was met at every point by batteries and rifle pits that 
we could not pass, and in the absence of Gen. Grant's 
co-operating force I was compelled to re-embark my 
command. My report to Gen. Grant, a copy of which I 
sent to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Gen. Halleck</a>, who will let you see it, is very 
full, and more than I could write to you with propriety. 
^Whatever you or the absent may think, not a soldier or 
officer who was present but will admit I pushed the 
attack as far as prudence would justify, and that I 
re-embarked my command in the nick of time, for a 
heavy rain set in which would have swamped us and 
made it impossible to withdraw artillery and stores. 
Up to that time I was acting as the right wing of Gen. 
Grant's army ; but Gen. McClernand has arrived, and we 
now have a new organization, McClernand commanding the whole, and our present force divided into two 
commands, or corps d'armfe, one of which is commanded 
by me and one by Morgan of Cumberland Gap. We 
are now en route for the Arkansas. Up that river about 
50 miles the enemy is entrenched and has sent down 
to the Mississippi and captured two steamboats, conveying to the fleets supplies. Now it is unwise to leave 
such a force on our rear and flank, and inasmuch as 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> is not prepared to march down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> by land, we can attack this post of Arkansas and 
maybe reach. Little Rock. Success in this quarter will 
have a good effect on the main river. But in the end 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> must be reduced, and it is going to be a 
hard nut to crack. It is the strongest place I ever 
saw, both by nature and art; and so far as we could 
observe it is defended by a competent force of artillery, 
infantry and cavalry. Besides its railroad connections 
with the interior give them great advantages. . . . 
</p><p>
My orders from Grant were to leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> by the 
18th, and I got off the 20th and I was exactly on time 
to co-operate with Grant. I did not know that he was 
delayed by the breaking of his railroad communications 
to his rear. Indeed, I supposed him to be advancing 
south towards the Yazoo River. My entire force was 
30,000 and was every man I could raise at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> 
and Helena, and Grant and Halleck were fully advised 
of my strength and plans. I suppose you are now fully 
convinced of the stupendous energy of the South and 
their ability to prolong this war indefinitely, but I am 
further satisfied that if it lasts 30 years we must fight 
it out, for the moment the North relaxes its energies the 
South will assume the offensive and it is wonderful how 
well disciplined and provided they have their men. We 
found everywhere abundant supplies, even on the Yazoo, 
and all along the river we found cattle, and fat ones, 
feeding quietly. The country everywhere abounds with 
corn, and the soldiers, though coarsely, are well clad. 
We hear of the manufacture of all sorts of cloth and 
munitions of war. The river plantations are mostly 
abandoned, and all families, negroes, stock and cotton 
removed 25 miles back. . . .
