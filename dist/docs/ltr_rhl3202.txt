DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The unfortunate cause, which hath prevented me 
from attending to your last favor sooner, will, I hope, 
be my excuse. The long sickness and death of my 
much-loved brother of Bellevue, has for some time 
past confined me in Virginia, and removed every other 
consideration from my mind. I now embrace the first 
good opportunity of sending you the pamphlet of 
forgeries, that I formerly mentioned. It is among the 
pitiful arts of our enemies, to endeavour at sowing 
dissension among the friends of liberty and their country. With me, such tricks can never prevail. 
</p><p>
Give me leave, dear Sir, to congratulate you on 
the happy event of our treaty with France being so 
effectually concluded. Congress have ratified it on 
their part, and ordered the ratification to be delivered 
in due form. This will be announced to the public 
immediately. The counsels of France have been governed, in this affair, by true magnanimity and sound 
policy. It was magnanimous in his Most Christian 
Majesty, not to avail himself of our situation to demand unequal and oppressive terms; and it was wise 
to leave the commerce of America open to all the 
maritime states, which will prevent their jealous} 
and enmity, and make them foes instead of friends to 
England. Great Britain has its choice now of madness or meanness. She will not war with the house 
of Bourbon and North America at the same time ; so 
that I incline to think meanness will be her choice, 
as best befitting her present state and the minds of 
her rulers. It will probably happen, that the trade of France will not now be interrupted ; and thus, by 
affording no pretext for war, the whole force of our enemies may be devoted to one last and vigorous 
campaign against us. As wise men, we ought to be 
prepared for such an event, by collecting a strong 
army, and by every other means that can discourage 
and defeat such intentions of our inveterate enemies. 
Being disappointed this campaign, must infallibly compel the acknowledgment of our independence, and 
keep the world, for some time longer, in peace. Eng 
land alone will pay, for her wickedness and folly, by 
the loss of North America. 
</p><p>
Our information is good, that very few troops can 
come here from Germany ; and private letters, as well 
as public papers, say that the plan of getting regiments by subscription, though much boasted of at 
first, has fallen very low. From the Highlands of 
North Britain some men will be obtained, and per 
haps a few from England and Ireland, but there 
seems no reason to suppose that their every exertion can add more than four or five thousand to the 
present force in North America. But this will re 
quire a very considerable strength, on our part, to 
make the event certain. An unsettled dispute between the Emperor and the King of Prussia (which 
England will undoubtedly foment) concerning the di 
vision of the estate of the late Elector of Bavaria, 
has threatened a rupture in Europe, not for our ad 
vantage, because the former of these princes being 
with us, the latter might be disposed to favor the 
views of Great Britain, to our injury.

Alderman Lee writes, that there is some hope of 
this being negotiated happily. An intelligent correspondent in England writes to Alderman Lee, that it 
was uncertain whether Lord North's Bills would be 
agreed to or not, but that they were industriously 
sent over here, and circulated, to prevent our treaty 
with France from being concluded. Vain and unwise 
men ! Their means are always destructive of their 
ends. North's delusive and indecent propositions 
have accelerated an adoption of the agreement with 
France.

I am much concerned to find, in Virginia, such want of method and industry in collecting and bringing forward the drafts. When I came away, there 
were all the men (amounting to forty-one or two), 
both of the former and the latter drafts, remaining 
in King George, merely for want of an officer to 
bring them away ; and I am misinformed if it is not 
the case in other counties. As far as I have been 
able to learn, it is probable that, if dexterous recruiting officers were properly furnished for the business, 
and sent out, almost all these veterans, that have 
been discharged from our nine regiments, would reenlist in a short time. I am, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate and obedient servant,

P. S. Alderman Lee says, they talk of sending 
Lord Westcote and Hans Stanley here, to treat with 
us, and that they are to bring half a million of guineas to bribe the Congress. From their own corruptions, these men reason to the corruption of all others.

I had almost forgot to mention, that four expresses 
were sent from St. James's, on the subject of Generals Howe and Clinton. The latter had leave to go 
home ; the Court was disgusted with the , former, and 
had recalled him, but recollecting that Clinton might 
be come away, another messenger was sent to stop 
Howe, if that should be the case. I hoped, they are 
both gone.
