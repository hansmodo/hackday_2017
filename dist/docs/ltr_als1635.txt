My dear Sir
</p><p>
I have read with much pain the second editorial article of the Correo, dated the 24th of last month; and I am compelled to say that the labors, the sacrifices I have borne to save the nation in the recent struggle, and the dangers to which I have exposed myself and my [illegible] comrades in arms, are not [manuscript torn] to similar recompense. It appears to me to be a terrible threat to the nation’s peace. ¿And where are the grounds for this fear?
</p><p>
I have seen letters from your capital in which it is said that you (Spanish “usted”) are the author of the article, in which I am directly attacked. If it is you, truthfully, or if it is not, what is certain is that the Correo is under your direction and that without your consent nothing is inserted in it. This realization has made me experience a powerful emotion, since I did not expect such conduct from a person who calls himself my friend; especially when I have not given a motive to such a person. ¿Or, where is the motive? Explain to me in which form, or for which cause it can be said that as a result of danger to me the system is in order. It is a bizarre thing that when my work is unwaveringly directed toward the good of the nation, it can be believed that I am capable
of neglecting its interests. In the nine years during which with my person and sword I have served the nation, I do not believe there is anyone who with justice can make the same acrimonies against my character that the said editorial contains. As a lover of justice, I enjoy giving it, and in turn enjoy when others give it to me. Without presuming to be Aristides, I do want to imitate him; and if it be necessary, so that the imitation be more exact, that I suffer exile, I would suffer it. In prosperity as in adversity, I endeavor to master myself, and not that my passions dominate me: one will not diminish me, nor will another exult me more than what is just. I accept praises when I consider them deserved: I confess my mistakes when I notice them. If in my efforts for the general good I become separated, even for a moment, from the correct path, it is not because I chose to: as the error shows itself I will correct it. Thus has been my constant walk. Now listen to what I truly desire: that peace be preserved; that unity be consolidated, that the integrity of liberty be maintained: that the system be sustained.
</p><p>
Having clarified this, I am convinced that your attack which has inferred so much against me, could not have proceeded from any other cause other than you having taken offense because I suggested that you retire from the ministry. I said this to you as a friend: as I will repeat endlessly. The accusations against you are many and of much seriousness, relating to your public office as well as you in particular. These accusations refer to deeds that, certain or not, are so degrading and so repeated that you have been stripped of all prestige. As minister you have been accused of monopolies, bribes and illegal commerce, agitations that: specifically, it is told and retold about what occurred with Señorita pasienta de Tornél, as well as with other women. In light of this, ¿Would you not prefer that I suggest you
resign? Not only to you, I would also suggest this to the other secretaries of the office; since, justly or unjustly, they lack the necessary prestige, without which nothing can be advanced. I conclude by pointing out that I expect you will abstain from writing with regards to me in the terms with which you have done in the editorial, preparing your opinion against me, and painting me with colorful denigrating terms, as if I were a danger to the system, and as if I were a worthy object of spite more so than any other citizen.

This correspondence has lasted longer than what my tasks truthfully permit me; yet it is because I have not been able to excuse it any longer.
