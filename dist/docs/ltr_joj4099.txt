Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My report on the answer of the British minister to your 
memorial respecting our frontier posts, is under the consideration of Congress. Your ideas and mine on those subjects very nearly correspond, and I sincerely wish that you 
may be enabled to accommodate every difference between 
us and Britain, on the most liberal principles of justice and 
candour. The result of my inquiries into the conduct of 
the States relative to the treaty, is, that there has not been 
a single day since it took effect, on which it has not been 
violated in America, by one or other of the States ; and this 
observation is just, whether the treaty be supposed to have 
taken effect either at the date or exchange of the provisional 
articles, or on the day of the date of the definitive treaty, or 
of the ratifications of it. 
</p><p>
Our affairs are in a very unpleasant situation, and 
changes become necessary, and in some little degree probable. When government, either from defects in its construction or administration, ceases to assert its rights, or is 
too feeble to afford security, inspire confidence, and overawe the ambitious and licentious, the best citizens naturally 
grow uneasy and look to other systems. 
</p><p>
How far the disorders of Massachusetts may extend, or 
how they will terminate, is problematical ; nor is it possible 
to decide whether the people of Rhode Island will remain 
much longer obedient to the very extraordinary and exceptionable laws passed, for compelling them to embrace the 
doctrine of the political transubstantiation of paper into 
gold and silver. 
</p><p>
I suspect that our posterity will read the history of our 
last four years with much regret. 
</p><p>
I enclose for your information a pamphlet, containing the 
acts of the different States granting an impost to Congress. 
</p><p>
You will also find enclosed a copy of an act of Congress, 
of 20th and 21st ult., for raising an additional number of 
troops. This measure was doubtless necessary, although 
the difficulty of providing for the expense of it is a serious 
one. I flatter myself you will be able to obviate any improper suspicions which the minister may be led to entertain respecting the object of this force. I have pressed the 
policy of deciding on my report on the infractions of the 
treaty without delay, that you may thence be furnished 
with conclusive arguments against the insinuations of those 
who may wish to infuse and support opinions unfavourable 
to us on these points. 
</p><p>
The newspapers herewith sent will give you information 
in detail of Indian affairs, but they will not tell you what, 
however is the fact, that our people have committed several 
unprovoked acts of violence against them. These acts 
ouo-ht to have excited the notice of government, and been 
punished in an exemplary manner. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem and regard, I have the 
honour to be, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
