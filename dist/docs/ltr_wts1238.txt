Dear Brother : I was gratified by the general tone and 
spirit of your letter of yesterday, just received. You 
surely in the past have achieved as much success in civil 
affairs as my most partial friends claim for me in military affairs. It is now demonstrated that with universal suffrage and the organization of political parties no 
man of supreme ability can be President, and that our 
President with only four years is only a chip on the 
surface. Not a single person has been President in our 
time without having been, in his own judgment, the 
most abused, if not the most miserable, man in the 
whole community. Your experience has simply been 
with nominating conventions. It would have been tenfold worse had you succeeded in obtaining the nomination and election.

I had a letter from General Alger yesterday, asking 
me to ride in the procession at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, August 12th, in 
full uniform, to which I answered No with an emphasis. 
I will attend as a delegate from Missouri, as a private, 
and will not form in any procession, horseback or otherwise. It is cruel to march old veterans five miles, like 
a circus, under a mid-day sun for the gratification of a 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> audience. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
