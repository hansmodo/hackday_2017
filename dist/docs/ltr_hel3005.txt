DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In a public letter, which I had the honor of writing to your Excellency the 3d instant, by Major 
Price, I sent a number of handbills calculated for 
giving satisfactory information to the public, who were 
anxious to learn the recent intelligence from France. 
One article of this has been questioned, respecting 
the King of Prussia's promise, the only part of the 
performance that can be called mine. I believe my 
authority is good. Ird, under the 16th February, 
informs me, " the King of Prussia has given the most 
explicit and unequivocal assurance, that he will be 
the second power in Europe to acknowledge the in 
dependence of America." It is true our Commissioners, in their public advices, are not so express, nor 
are they, in my opinion, so full and clear in some 
other respects, as they might have been. 
</p><p>
Human nature pervades every human breast. A 
residence at Paris will not exempt men from infirmities of the mind ; nor is even the momentous concern 
of guardianship to thirteen United States, an infant 
world in danger of being crushed by the hand of 
violence, paramount to those curses upon mankind, 
pride and covetousness, sours from whence all the 
evils of this life spring. Our Ambassadorial Commissioners, of which your Excellency cannot be ignorant, 
are unhappily divided in sentiments. Jarrings and 
appeals have followed. Intelligence, intended for the 
public, loses part of that fulness and perspicuity, 
which would have appeared in candid and united 
counsels. I have seen so much of the world as to be 
guarded against surprise at any thing. No inconsiderable benefit results from attempts to reconcile, and 
even sweeten, the most untoward circumstances which 
happen in one's journey through it. I apprehend it 
would break in on your Excellency's time,, otherwise 
I would have troubled you with Mr. Ird's letter, not 
merely for information, but for a hope that something 
might be devised for promoting concord between our friends onder, or the public good, by a wise cooperation. But I will not dwell upon this subject. 
</p><p>
Last night I had the honor of receiving your Excellency's favor of the last of April, and am happy 
in finding a confirmation of my sentiments respecting 
persons proper for treating with the expected deputation from our adversary. I fear the determination, 
where only this point can be determined, will be contrary. Be it so ; thank God we have here some men 
of abilities and integrity. I hope we shall make a 
judicious choice. The act of Congress of the 22d 
April will blot out pages of the British instructions. 
The Commissioners from that side will perceive a 
necessity for taking a new departure from the Tower 
of Independence ; and what happened in France, on 
the 6th of February, will oblige them to shape a new 
course. From the absence of the Commissioners, I 
presume they had not sailed from England on the 
10th of March. It may have been found expedient, at 
St. James's, to vest them with more ample powers, it 
they meant to come, than were originally intended, 
and under new sanctions of Parliament ; a work of 
slow progress. The people would have much to say. 
That the nation were more than a little agitated, appears from a letter, which I take the liberty of in 
closing for your Excellency's perusal. I have like 
wise a letter from the mercantile line in London, 
which proves to me the people in general had very sensibly felt the weight of the war, were ardently desirous of peace, and anxious lest Congress should reject the intended propositions. 
</p><p>
The long, arid, as I humbly think, unnecessary delay of the army arrangement, is very afflicting. I 
know it must give extreme pain to your Excellency. 
It is improper for me to touch upon the cause, especially when it is so well known that Congress have 
been engaged in very important business. The plan 
introduced for that part of it which is intended to establish a half-pay for officers during life, I have 
been uniformly averse from, and in a committee of 
Congress delivered my objections. These appear to 
me, at this moment, of more weight, because they have 
not been removed by the reasonings which have been 
offered against them, and I may, without vanity, think 
myself not obstinate. I am open to conviction, and 
always, without murmuring, submit to a majority. I 
view the scheme as altogether unjust and unconstitutional in its nature, and full of dangerous consequences. It is an unhappy dilemma to which we 
seem to be reduced. Provide for your officers in terms dictated to you, or lose all the valuable soldiers 
among them ; establish a pension for officers, make 
them a separate body, to be provided for by the 
honest yeomanry, and others of their fellow-citizens, 
many thousands of whom have equal claims upon 
every ground of loss of estate, health, &c,, or lose 
your army and your cause. That such provision will 
be against the grain of the people, has been unwarily 
testified by its advocates, whom I have heard con 
verse upon the subject. Indeed, they have furnished 
strong ground for opposition against an immediate 
compliance with the demand. If we cannot make 
justice one of the pillars, necessity may be submitted to at present; but republicans will, at a pro 
per time, withdraw a grant which will appear to have 
been extorted. 
</p><p>
Were I in private conversation with an officer on 
this point, I should not despair of fairly balancing 
every grievance he might suppose to be peculiar to 
the army, by instances of losses and inconveniences 
in my own property and person ; and I count myself 
very happy, compared with thousands who have as 
faithfully adhered to our original compact. It is said, 
gentlemen did not think the war would have continued so long. Forgive me, Sir, a ludicrous remark 
which I made early in our contest, indeed in Eng 
land, before the commencement of the contest. " I 
know my countrymen are good for the quarter, but I 
have doubts of their going the course." There is a 
certain versatility, habitual if not almost constitutional, in men born south of thirty-eight degrees of 
latitude, in these States. circumstances, which have 
occurred in the progress of this war, have given 
strength to my observation. 
</p><p>
There are, within that division of America, not only 
objects inviting, but temptations almost irresistible, to 
change, to say nothing of the general train of education. Hence, it is easy to account for a resignation of a commission, which had been anxiously solicited by 
scores. The want of something is made an excuse, 
and even sometimes by worthy characters, who do 
not suspect themselves. Would to God, gentlemen 
had followed the noble, patriotic example of their 
Commander-in-chief, a plan which, reflection will show 
them in a shade of disgrace, would never have found 
place in their minds. How superior are many of the 
gentlemen, now in my contemplation (for I know 
many with whom I do not converse), to the acceptance of a half-pay, contributed to by widows and orphans of soldiers who had bled and died by their 
sides ! shackled with a condition of being excluded 
from the privilege of serving in officers, in common 
with their fellow-citizens voted in every House of 
Assembly as the drones and incumbrances of society, 
pointed at by boys and girls, there goes a man, who 
every year robs me of part of my pittance. I think, 
Sir, I do not overstrain. This will be the language 
of republicans ; how pungent, when applied to gentlemen who shall have stepped from the army into a 
good remaining estate ; how much deeper to some, 
who, in idleness and by speculation, have amassed estates in the war ! 
</p><p>
This, Sir, is a large field. Virtue and honor might 
be summoned to answer, but it is time for me to for 
bear. I am obliged to write in haste, called upon by 
particular public duties. Besides, I feel a full assurance, notwithstanding the present seeming contrariety, that my sentiments, when fully explained, will 
not differ essentially from your Excellency s. I must 
not, however, conclude without these declarations, that 
I am not among those to whom may be applied, 
" Our God and soldier we adore, in time of danger, 
&c." I am most heartily disposed to distinguish the gallant officers and soldiers, by the most liberal marks 
of esteem, desirous of making proper provision for all 
who shall stand in need. I would not except even 
some of the brave, whose expenses have been princely in extravagance, while they complained of insufficiency of pay. 
</p><p>
I have ever detested, and never practised, Parliamentary jockeyings for procrastinating an unpalatable 
business, which, as a silent auditor and spectator, I 
have, within some time past, known to be alternately adopted. I most sincerely wish the army had been 
wisely attended to. The high esteem I from gratitude bear for your Excellency, whose sufferings from a contrary conduct I know must have been great, 
as well as my love of despatch, makes me wish it ; 
and I lament that, in some degree, we are likely to 
be indebted more to the policy and deep projects of 
other men for our deliverance, than to our own wisdom and fortitude. I am, with the most sincere respect, and the most respectful affection and esteem, 
dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obliged servant.
