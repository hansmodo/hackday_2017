<p>
TO LORD GRENVILLE 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, December 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
MY LORD : 
</p><p>
I have received the card which your Lordship did me the honor to write me yesterday; but observing that it is directed to me as Minister Plenipotentiary from the United 
States of America, I think it necessary to inform your Lordship, that I am not honored with that character, and that the credential letter, which I have the honor to bear from the 
President of the United States to his Majesty, styles me Minister Resident of the United States of America, at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>. 
</p><p>
If this circumstance, according to the customary usages of this court, be such as to preclude me from the honor of an 
audience to deliver my credential letter to his Majesty, I must request of your Lordship that it may be notified to 
me, as I cannot by any acquiescence or assent on my part admit that I am vested with the character of a Minister 
Plenipotentiary.
</p><p>
I have the honor &c. 
</p><p>
[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="me">John Quincy Adams</a>]
