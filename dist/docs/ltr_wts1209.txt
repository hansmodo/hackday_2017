Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I am now established here with a good headquarters, 
corner of 10th and Locust, where I can dispatch promptly 
all business that properly devolves on me. I have; as I 
have always had, the smallest possible staff and a most 
inexpensive establishment, and therefore am not regarded 
by the non-combatant staff who flock in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, as 
a friend of that ornamental part of the army. But here 
I am in easy communication with, and in perfect harmony 
with, the real working army. . . . 
</p><p>
But if let alone, I will do what devolves on me by law 
and custom, and endeavor to injure no one ; but of those 
fellows in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> who have served through several 
great wars, and boast that they have never heard a shot, 
and never had to do the dirty work of campaigning, I 
will speak out and Congress will have to notice it. 
</p><p>
The Republican newspaper in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, their organ, 
intimates that inasmuch as I have removed from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, I am not in harmony with the Administration and 
should resign. By my office I am above party, and am 
not bound in honor or fact to toady to anybody. Therefore I shall never resign, and shall never court any other 
office, so they may reserve their advice to men who seek 
it. ... 
</p><p>
I have always expressed a desire that some good man, 
a statesman of experience if he can be found, be selected 
for President. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> has had enough to recognize the obligation of the country to the army, and the 
time has come to return to the civil list. In no event and 
uilder no circumstances will I yield to this, my final 
determination. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
