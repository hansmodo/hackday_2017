Dear Brother: I received yours of 26th of January 
here at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=rome" rel="city">Rome</a>, and have been so busy that really I. have 
had no time to write my home letters. We have been 
here ten days, and now start for Naples, where we shall 
stay a week, and then for Malta, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=constantinople" rel="city">CONSTANTINOPLE</a>, and the East. We are everywhere received with 
every honor and attention ; indeed too much for our own 
comfort and advantage. No nation or people seem to be 
held in such estimation as the Americans. . . . 
</p><p>
The Italians are a kind, good people, and are winning 
their place among the scientific men of the world. Some 
of their modern railroads evince a talent in that branch 
worthy the old days of the Coliseum. 
</p><p>
The unification of Italy seems to grow in strength, and 
the Pope, though obstinate, is in no manner interfered 
with in his office, and I think in time he will realize that 
he is stronger by being entirely disconnected with the 
administration of a petty state or kingdom. This is the 
opinion also of many Catholics. It is possible that some 
want the Pope to be considered somewhat of a martyr, 
but those who control the government here understand 
well enough the problem. 
</p><p>
The King is at Naples, but his son Prince Humbert has 
been extremely polite to us and has tendered all proper 
attentions. 
</p><p>
I do not see but the people are as free here as in 
France or other neighboring countries, there being substantially a free press, and thus far we have not even been 
called on for our passports, a perfect contrast to the 
annoyances of former times. Italy is full of Americans and we meet everywhere our country people, who 
seem to take the lead as sculptors, painters, travellers, 
etc. .
