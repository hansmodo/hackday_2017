GENTLEMEN: I find my time so much occupied that I shall be unable to continue my correspondence with your paper and of course must relinquish all claim on you for sending your paper either to me or to my friends on my account.--Since the fire of the 4th of May, I have been, like thousands of others, a gentleman loafer, living on the glories which were left after the fire had done its worst and thinking what I would do if I was a respectable man--that is,
if I had money. As a man's merit is chiefly measured by the fullness of his purse, my claim to the high consideration of my countrymen is only moderate; but I console myself with the pleasing reflection that I care but devilish little about it. I have just read two numbers of the Free Trader and a letter written by Mr. Gum to Mr. Keefer, by which I see that you are blessed with floods, scarcity of money, office seekers, and high life below stairs in various ways. The conclusion that we come to here is that no man knows anything unless he has been to California, for we are about fifty years ahead in knowledge to you poor deluded mortals at home. When we see you chaffering and higgling about a few cents in county operations or a half a cent in the price of coal, it looks mighty small, and the conclusion we come to is that you are a picayune people.
</p><p>
Why, I haven't seen but one copper cent since I have been in this country and that gave me the diarrhea. I gave the fellow two bits to throw it away. A strange convulsion of nature has recently occurred here. The mountains have all turned into gold, and instead of digging as was formerly the case, and living on pork and bread, all you have to do is to load up a wagon with rock and dine on mush and milk which fill the gulches. I've written truth so much before that I can afford to lie a little now. Well, now in sober earnest, the streams are so low that the beds can be worked to advantage, and a vast amount of gold will be taken out, more than in any previous season. The quartz mining is becoming profitable and begins to be worked systematically--$1,520 was taken from one mine last week.--All of our company have sold out except myself. They call the trade thirty thousand dollars. I still hold on with the new company and am to superintend the mining for three hundred dollars per month. I intended to have come home this fall, but as I want fifteen barrels of gold, I must wait till spring. I have but little idea of ever coming back to live, and somehow the conviction is forced upon my imagination that I have a good chance here. But let me tell you one thing, boys, if you come here to get rich, you will have to look the elephant square in the face in some shape or other.
</p><p>
I intend to get married next week; I have bribed two sheriffs and four auctioneers to buy a woman or two at the first auction sale of livestock. Would you like a few dozen? They are of but little account here, and although there is quite a rush of them from the States, they will find the market glutted and will be compelled to work for a living at from fifty to a hundred dollars per month on their arrival. They had better stay at home. The squaws have vastly improved the Bloomer dresses. From neck to heels they wear only a small grass apron. This they say does not impede the free use of their limbs and is much more comfortable in hot weather; besides 'tain't half the
trouble to dress and undress.--Pshaw! what's the use of dictating to women what dress they shall wear? They'd do as they please anyhow. I intend to let all my wives take their own way and thereby save myself a hatchelling.
</p><p>
Murder, robberies and gambling is on the wane. The glorious Vigilance Committees are teaching the courts their duty, and order is coming out of chaos and confusion.
</p><p>
Had Milton lived now he would have placed the scene of the grand combat in California; at all events his devils would have found plenty of ammunition here.
</p><p>
There is no suffering on the plains this year so far. But '49 and '50 will afford a thrilling theme for some future historian. Saw Keefer just now--he is doing well, and I am glad of it. He is an energetic, industrious man, and has the milk of human kindness in his veins. I saw Pete Hoes at Grass Valley last week--is doing nothing, and probably will not I haven't got to drinking, stealing or gambling yet, but expect to commence in a day or two.
</p><p>
There is lots of news, but the papers have it all, and letter-writers are getting below par.--Money is scarce and taters is fell
</p><p>
Yours, &c.,
