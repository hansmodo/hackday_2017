HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,

Dear Brother : ... As to the army, I agree that it is 
entirely too costly. Twenty-five thousand soldiers with 
a due proportion of officers ought to be maintained at 
less than present estimates, which I see are stated at 
forty and also at fifty -five millions. This must embrace 
appropriations for forts, harbors, etc., whose disbursements fall under the engineer and other bureaus of the 
War Department. The heaviest cost to the army is in 
these expensive bureaus of which we have ten, all of 
which have a head in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> and run, as it were, 
a separate machine. I have no hesitation in saying that 
if the Secretary of War has the lawful power to command the army through the Adjutant-General, then my 
office is a sinecure and should be abolished. Instead of 
being useful, it is simply ornamental and an obstacle to 
unity of command and harmony of action. No two men 
can fulfil the same office; and the law should clearly 
define the functions of each, or mine should be abolished. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
