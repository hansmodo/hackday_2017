SIR: 
</p><p>
As I think it proper to form a respectable camp on the north side of <a href='/results.php?city=santee' rel='city'>Santee</a> River, at Col. Macdonald's plantation, called Wright's Bluff, 
near the road leading from Manigault's and Gaillard's ferries to Camden, as soon as possible, (not only to cover and secure the country, but 
to proceed towards Charlestown, in order to compel the enemy to raise the siege of that place), I desire you will use your utmost endeavors 
to meet me there with as many volunteers as you can collect; but if they should not amount to a third, with one-third (to be drafted) 
of your regiment, properly armed and accoutred, as soon as they can be resembled. I persuade myself that a consideration of the important service which this measure may render, will induce you to use 
your utmost exertions to procure the men, and then to turn out cheerfully and speedily on this occasion, especially as the circumstances to which the country militia seem averse, viz. the being confined 
in town, will not happen for I don't mean to lead them thither. There are, I hope, men enough in town to defend it against an attack; 
but I think we should relieve our brethren there by obliging the enemy to give up the siege, and deliver the State from the calamities of war, 
by forcing the enemy to abandon the country, which, as I expect considerable aid from the northward, I doubt not they will soon be under 
the necessity of doing, if our militia will exert themselves as they ought. You will bring with you all the waggons, cattle and provisions, you can collect, but don't delay your march unnecessarily to wait for them. 
Dispatch is essential. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
