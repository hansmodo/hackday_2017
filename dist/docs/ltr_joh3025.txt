SIR, 
</p><p>
You will perceive, from the inclosed resolves, the 
fixed determination of Congress to retaliate, as nearly 
as lies in their power, on our enemies, should they 
think proper to send any of their prisoners to Great 
Britain, or to any other part of the British King's 
dominions beyond sea. This resolution you will please 
to convey to General Howe, as soon as possible, as 
it is of the utmost importance. 
</p><p>
If the sixteen additional battalions are not all provided with commanding officers, the Congress, in consequence of a letter from Governor Caswell (an Extract of which I inclose to you), have recommended 
Colonel Abraham Shepherd to the command of one of 
the said battalions, and doubt not you will honor him 
with the appointment. I beg leave to request your 
attention to the whole of the resolves herewith transmitted. 
</p><p>
Inclosed you have the observations of Monsieur Du-coudray on Billingsport, and the other fortifications in 
this river, which I forward for your perusal. Every 
possible measure is taking to render the fortifications 
complete. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the utmost esteem and 
respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
