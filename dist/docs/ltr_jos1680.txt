Dear Brother : Your note of the 4th is received. I am 
glad to hear you are settled, and from all accounts delightfully. You deserve quiet-and repose after five years of 
change and labor. When in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> the other day, 
I found that party of English capitalists were delighted 
with their visit with you, and seemed especially polite 
to me on that account. I got for two of them Bowman 
and Nichols' works, 1 which they wanted to take home. 
But for my political employment I could have received from them very lucrative employment in the 
prosecution of their vast railroad schemes. Even as it 
is, if they, within six months, show their ability to execute their plans, I will identify myself much more with 
them. The truth is, the close of the war with our resources unimpaired gives an elevation, a scope to the 
ideas of leading capitalists, far higher than anything ever 
undertaken in this country before. They talk of millions as confidently as formerly of thousands. No doubt 
the contraction that must soon come will explode merely 
visionary schemes, but many vast undertakings will be 
executed. Among them will be the Pacific E. K. and 
extensive iron works, like some in England. Our manufactures are yet in their infancy, but soon I expect to 
see, under the stimulus of a great demand and the protection of our tariff, locomotive and machine shops 
worthy of the name. I do not fear, whatever may be the 
result of the senatorial election, but I can find enough 
to do, and without lowering the position I have occupied. 
As for the chances, from all the information I can gather, 
there is but little doubt a majority of the Legislature is 
for me. Still I know enough of the shifts and dangers 
in a new body of men like a Legislature not to be over 
sanguine. Since I am in the contest I will do all I can 
for success, and hope my friends will do likewise, but if 
defeated will bear it patiently. In a short time I will 
send you a list of the members who are from the military 
service, in the hope that you may know some of them 
well enough to influence them. You can feel perfectly 
easy in doing this, as my opponents use to the uttermost 
against me any prejudice or feeling against you. This 
election over, I think I shall be very willing to say good 
by to politics, and will then seek to settle myself comfortably in some part of Ohio where I can engage in 
railroads, banking, or manufacturing. The law in this 
country is now only useful as^th^L^atliway^to other 
pursuits.

I have seen Johnson several times. He seems kind 
and patient with all his terrible responsibility. I think 
he feels what every one must have observed, that the 
people will not trust the party or men who, during the 
war, sided with the rebels. The Democratic party is 
doomed forever as a disloyal organization, and no promises, or pledges, or platform they can make will redeem 
them from the odium they justly gained. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
