MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE result of Saturday's debate in the House of 
Representatives removes all anxiety for the remainder 
of this session, and leaves me at liberty to ask leave to 
go home. The state of my own health, which requires 
relaxation, and the sickness in my family and neighborhood, would have well justified me if I had retired 
even before the great question was decided. I shall ask 
leave this day, unless something unforeseen should 
happen to prevent me. If I should obtain leave of 
absence after Thursday next, I shall be at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
on Sunday. Whether I shall go by water or land 
from thence, will depend upon circumstances. Some 
time in the course of the week after next, I hope to 
see you, but there are so many circumstances of 
wind and weather, as well as other things, which may 
intervene, that I cannot make any disposition by which 
I can calculate to a day or a week when I shall get home. 
</p><p>
It is a mortifying consideration that five months 
have been wasted upon a question whether national 
faith is binding on a nation. Nothing but the ignorance and inexperience of this people can excuse 
them. Really, we have not a right sense of moral 
or national obligation. We have no national pride, 
no national sense of honor. I suppose the decision 
of the House has determined the President's resignation and retirement. And the question who shall succeed him may occasion as much controversy and animosity as the treaty with Great Britain, which was 
ultimately determined by no proper considerations of 
merit, but merely by fear of constituents in many. 
</p><p>
If my plan should be altered in any respect, I shall 
write you an account of it. I must spend a little 
time with the children at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I have been 
five months without once mounting a horse and with 
out one long walk, so that, although I have walked 
every day more or less, I am under some fears of the 
effect upon my health of a journey of a hundred 
miles a day in a stage. 
</p><p>
The enclosed letters please to file away carefully 
with the others. 
</p><p>
With the tenderest affection, I am 
</p><p>
