</p><p>
 
To His Excellency J. Neely Johnson, Governor of California.,
</p><p>
Sir: I had the honor to receive last evening your communication of the 4th inst. By Colonel E. A. Rowe.
</p><p>
In reply I would remark that, on examination of the laws of Congress, I find that no person has the authority to grant the request therein presented but the President of the United States. In a recent contest in Kansas Territory, somewhat analogous to that which you state exists in the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, on application, I believe, of the governor of the Territory for arms and ammunition to aid in suppressing it, the President refused to grant them.
</p><p>
Under these circumstances am constrained to decline granting your requisition.
</p><p>
I am, very respectfully,<br/>
Your obedient servant
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jew" rel='me'>John E. Wool, Major-General.</a>
