It would be only the absurd tableaux I agreed to, with plenty of fun, and nothing more. So I tried to 
be merry and content, and so I should have been, for there was plenty to talk about, and every one

was so solicitous for my comfort ; and there was Mr. Enders who would wheel my chair for me wherever 
I wished it, and was as kind and attentive as a 
brother. Surely my first trip should have been a gay 
one! Miriam sat down by the piano, Mr. Enders 
drew me by her, and we three sang until dark 
together. A Mr. Morse, his wife, and mother, who 
are spending a week here, were our audience. The 
first two retired at candle-light, while the latter, 
present at the play the night before, remained to the 
last. But while we sang, every noise at the parlor 
door caused us to turn with the apprehension of 
we hardly knew what. A dozen times Mr. Enders 
consulted his watch, and telegraphed his fears to me, 
though I persisted in thinking it only the fun that 
had been intended. 
</p><p>
Half-past six came, and with it, Mrs. Worley. 
Now, she knew better. For Dr. Dortch had come to 
see me, and was guiding me in my game of euchre 
in which I was not even as wise as my partner, Mr. Enders, when her note came. Instantly we put 
down our cards, while Miriam begged him to write 
and tell her the true story. He wrote and we all 
read it. Not only that, but Miriam added a post 
script which I think was this, word for word: " Mrs. Worley, it is only a bet at cards, intended as the 
merest joke. There is not a word of truth in it, and 
I will consider it the greatest favor if you will 
contradict the report whenever you may hear it!" 
Explicit enough, one would think; but still she came, 
and sent word into the parlor that one of the ladies 
present when Will made the announcement had sent 
her contribution to the evening's fun. It turned 
out to be a complete bridal suit, worn by the lady 
a year ago! That was too serious a jest. Miriam 
went into the other room to speak to Mrs. Worley, 
who, cold as an icicle, refused to receive or make 
explanation, beyond "I won't kiss you; this is too 
cruel." There was nothing to do; she returned 
laughing, but certainly feeling herself the injured 
one, and so she was. 
</p><p>
In fifteen minutes, another stir. I held my breath with expectation. Lydia introduced Mr. G . 
Ten miles he had ridden through mud and water that freezing evening, at Will Carter's request, to 
perform the ceremony between him and Miriam. Lydia laughed until she could hardly introduce him. 
He, hat in hand, bowed around the convulsed circle 
with a countenance shining with the most sublimely 
vacant expression. O that man's idiotic face, and 
solemn, portentous look, brought a writhe even to 
my trembling lips! Mr. Enders would have given 
one an excellent idea of the effect produced by 
a real old piney-woods chill ; he shook as with 
suppressed laughter. But when the tremendous 
preacher (tremendous because composed of gigantic 
Nothing) turned his lugubrious face towards Mrs. Morse, and addressed her as Mrs. Morgan under 
the impression that she had come down to see her 
daughter married, Miriam's risibles could no longer 
stand it, and she flew from the room in time to avoid 
a disgraceful explosion. 
</p><p>
I was growing frightened. Mr. Enders was leaning over my chair, and involuntarily it burst from 
me with a groan, "For God's sake, help me save 
her!" "Hush! Lie back in your chair! I will!" 
he whispered. " But for the love of Heaven, save my 
sister! " " I'll do what you will, if you will only keep 
still and not hurt yourself. I'll do my best." It was 
all whispered, that the minister and Mrs. Morse 
might not hear. " If it were your sister, what would 
you do?" "My God! I d meet him on the front 
gallery and kick him out ! Then I d know one of us 
must die to-morrow!" "But under the circumstances it is impossible for Gibbes to act!" I urged, 
while we agreed that it was the most unwarrantable 
piece of insolence ever perpetrated. While we talked, Gibbes had seized Miriam and, without interfering 
or advising further, advised her to keep her room and not meet Will. 
</p><p>
But I skipped the most important part. She came 
back when she had recovered her composure, and 
sat by me. Mr. Enders, when I asked what was best 
to do, whispered that to spare Will's feelings, and 
avoid a most painful scene, as well as to show that 
she had no serious intentions whatever, she should 
see that the minister was put in full possession of 
the facts before it went any farther. He felt keenly 
his unpleasant situation, and it was only our earnest 
request that induced him to remain, or give his advice. Who should explain? Certainly not the General. He thought the joke carried too far, and retired 
to his room before Mr. G - came. How take 
part against his own nephew? Not Gibbes either, 
for he had gone upstairs too worried and annoyed 
to talk to any one; besides, it was his wife's cousin. 
Who then? Miriam is one woman in a thousand. 
Rising, she crossed the room slowly and as dignified 
as though she only meant to warm herself. I think 
I see her before me now, as she stood before the fire, facing Mr. G , looking so handsome and stylish 
in her black grenadine with the pale-green trimming, 
telling her story. Plainly, earnestly, distinctly, with 
out hurry or embarrassment, in the neatest, prettiest, most admirable speech I ever heard, she told 
everything just as it was. Bravo for Miriam ! There 
lives not the woman in this State who could do so 
painful a thing in such a beautiful way. I felt like 
hugging her. Oh, it was magnificent ! He heard her 
in surprise, but when once satisfied of its truth, he 
said, "Well, Miss Morgan, when you stand on the 
floor, when I ask if you will, it is your privilege to 
answer, No." Miriam is not one to do so cruel 
a thing; she is too noble to deceive him so far and 
wound him so cruelly before all, when he believed 
himself so near happiness. She said that it was 
mockery, she would not suffer him to believe for an 
instant that she meant to marry him ; if he believed 
it, he was deceiving himself wilfully, for he already 
knew that she had told him it could never be. He 
agreed to take it only as a jest, promised that he 
would not feel hurt; and with the most admirable 
tact, Miriam, the trump (I have been playing euchre, 
excuse me), settled the minister, and the wedding, 
by her splendid behavior, with no trouble. 
</p><p>
A rapid step was heard in the hall; the bride groom had come! I know he must have killed his horse. He certainly did not leave his house before 
one o clock; it is twenty miles by the road to Clinton; he went there, procured his license, and was here at seven, in full costume. He bounded up 
stairs to meet the bride-elect. 
</p><p>
I can fancy him going to <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, doubting, fearing, believing against all evidence, yet trembling; 
securing the license at last, persuading himself that she would not dare refuse when the deeds were 
recorded in court, and he held them in his hand; and very few women would have been brave enough, 
too; he did not know My Miriam! I can fancy the poor horse lashed through the heavy mire, tired, 
foaming, panting, while his strong arm urged it on, with whip and spur; I can hear the exulting beating 
of his heart, that wild refrain that was raging as his death-knell - - " Mine! Mine at last!" I could hear 
it, I say. It rung in my ears all night. He held her in his power; she must be his; hastily, yet carefully 
he performs his toilet ; I dare say he stopped to think which cravat she liked best. "Mine! Mine!" the 
song is ringing in every stroke of his throbbing breast. Mount! Mount! Two miles fly past. He 
sweeps through the moonlight like Death riding on a pale horse; yonder shine lights in the parlor; 
and that above; is it hers? He throws himself from his horse; his hour has come, hers too; with the 
license and minister, his own adoration and she must love him too ! he will win ! Show him the 
way to her! She is his forever now! His? My God! had I not reason to cry, "In God's name, save her, 
Frank!" He reaches Mrs. Carter's room, and triumphantly throws the license on her table. He is ready now; where is his bride? 
</p><p>
Some one meets him. "Will!" 
</p><p>
The story is told ; she is not to be won by f of ce ; 
she has appealed to the minister; he has carried the 
jest too far. The strong man reels; he falls on the 
bed in his bridal array in agony too great for tears. 
I dare not ask what followed; they tell me it was 
awful. What madness and folly, to dream of forcing her to marry him! Why, if she had loved him, 
the high-handed proceeding would have roused the 
lion of her spirit ! He is no mate for her. He has but 
one thought, and at last words come. "Miriam! 
Miriam ! Call her, for the love of God ! " One word ! 
one look! Oh, she will take pity on him in his misery. 
Let her come for one instant ! she cannot be so cruel ! 
she will marry him if only to save him from death, 
or worse! And fortunate it was that he was not 
armed, one of the two would have died; perhaps 
both. The heartbroken prayer goes on. The exulting "Mine! Mine!" has changed to the groan of 
despair, "Miriam! for the love of God! come to me!" 
</p><p>
And where is the bride? Gibbes has her caged in 
the next room, this one where I am now lying. He 
has advised her not to appear; to go to bed and say 
no more. Sent to bed like a baby on her wedding 
night ! She says that she laughed aloud when the door 
closed on her. She laughing in here, he groaning in 
there, it is to be hoped they each drowned the voice 
of the other. . . . The minister said good-night. He 
disclaimed all feeling of pique ; he felt chiefly for the 
young lady and the disappointed groom. (Ouf !) 
I sent to ask Will to come to me alone for a moment ; 
no, he could not see me; write to him. 
</p><p>
Slowly, as though an aged, infirm, tottering man, 
we heard him descending the steps. How different 
from the step that carried him up ! We, conscience-stricken, sat within, with doors closed. He was off. 
He has again mounted his horse, and the broken 
hearted man, hardly less cruel than the expectant 
bridegroom, dashes the rowel in his side and disap 
pears like a whirlwind. 
</p><p>
I can fancy mother's and Lilly's agony, when they 
hear of the wedding. All <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> knew it last night, 
and if they did, too, I know there was as little sleep 
for them as for us. I know mother shrieked, "My 
child! My child!" while Lilly cried. How could he 
believe she meant to marry him, without even sending word to mother when he was going to the very 
town? Bah ! What a jolly go if those two got hysterics about the supposed Moral Suicide! Glad I was 
not at the tea-party ! Well, fearing the effect of such 
a shock in mother's nervous stat;e, Gibbes advised 
Miriam to go on the cars this evening, and convince 
her that it had not occurred, court records and 
licenses and minister to the contrary notwithstanding; so my duck, my angel, she whom I call my Peri 
with the singed wings (children who play in the fire 
must expect to be burned), set off on her pious 
errand, without the protecting arm of her bride 
groom.
