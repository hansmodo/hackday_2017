The spirit has not moved me to write for some time. I believe not since Sarah came up here. She has at last gotten settled down in very good lodgings for this country, over our store. She has been here about a month and I have gotten pretty well posted up on affairs down east. She reminds me very much of Mother and thinks, like
her, that the chief end of Woman is to sweep and wash and is in Heaven if she has plenty of wood and water. I am not so engaged but, what with the assistance of a Digger, I can keep her supplied. She knew me at sight and she has not changed. So all hopes of my coming home and not being recognized are vain. 'Twould be so tragical, you know, if I could some day step into your house, inquire after your brother whom I had met with in California or Tahiti, etc., and finally a grand tableau, brother and Sister rush into each other arms, curtain falls!

Our city is growing and filling up with people fast. Within the last month, over 500 Chinamen and as many Americans have arrived here and the cry is 'Lice! Lice!' (rice). They prefer it to flour and we can't keep enough on hand. It sells 3 lbs for a dollar, flour, 4 lbs. We are doing a good business, own a mule train and the store we occupy; so our expenses are light and I hope at last 'Something has turned up.' Business below is dull and goods cheap. This is all the better for us as we get just as good prices as when they are high.

For amusement we have had a cock fight and two horse races lately and the grand ball of the season comes off Monday night at the new Union Hotel. Ladies are expected from Shasta and all along the road and we have twenty five in town. Sarah declines to go. Besides this, we have a 'Medium' in town. Last night we made up a private party to test his spiritual arts. We sat around a table for some time and he called on the spirits to manifest themselves by tipping the table. This was done. The table was moved to all sorts of ways; tipped over entirely and finally tipped toward a man by the name of Jones. His guardian spirit was up and answered all his questions correctly. It was the spirit of his sister. Upon his asking the question the name was spelt--'Mary Ann.' The year she died, her age, the number of his brothers and
sisters, etc. None of the rest of us had guardian spirits round, as we could not get a sign. This is all very strange but he accounts for it on the principle of electricity and magnetism. I think it is the same thing as mesmerism. I believe the raps and moving of the table is produced by some material cause. I don't believe that the departed spirits have anything to do with it. I have never believed in anything supernatural but I may be convinced hereafter. The experiments last night may be all accounted for by natural causes and mesmerism. Even if one believed the whole thing I see nothing to make one crazy, as I see numbers are in the States.

I think next month of going to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Heretofore, I have remained here constantly and Cole goes with the train. I think of taking a turn at packing again. 'The British army swore dreadfully in Flanders' but nothing to what packers do in that line in California. On account of its tendency to profanity I dislike the business.

Sarah has written a host of letters and I supposed has described her situation. Maybe she does not like it but she does not complain. I have lived so long in this half-civilized State that I don't miss the little 'fixins' you have at home, and think perhaps that I have all the comforts of life about me when in reality I lack many things, but 'where ignorance is bliss, etc.'
