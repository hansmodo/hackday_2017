CLIFTON HOUSE, January 12. [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1868">1868</a>]

MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : Your last letter was received a day or two since. I have moved my 
quarters to this house, so please direct all your letters here. Why did you not urge them not to 
take my goods to Providence? For heaven's sake see K. & B. when you receive this, and have 
them immediately returned to me, with their bill. I am so miserable I feel like taking my own life. 
My darling boy, my Taddie alone, I fully believe? prevents the deed. Your letter announcing that 
my clothes* were to be paraded in Europe: those * The clothes that I have given for the benefit of Wilberforce College. They have been deeded to Bishop Payne, who 
will do with them as he thinks best, for the cause to which 
they are dedicated. The letter on page 366 will explain more fully. 
</p><p>
I gave you has almost turned me wild. II. would go raving distracted if such a thing was 
done. If you have the least regard for our reason, pray write to the bishop that it must not be done. 
How little did I suppose you would do such a thing; you cannot imagine how much my overwhelming sorrows would be increased. May kind 
Heaven turn your heart, and have you write that this exhibition must not be attempted. R. would 
blast us all if you were to have this project carried out. Do remember us in our unmitigated 
anguish, and have those clothes, worn on those fearful occasions, recalled. * * I am positively dying with a broken heart, and the probability is that I shall be living but a very short 
time. May we all meet in a better world, where such grief is unknown. Write me all about 
yourself. I should like you to have about four black widow's caps, just such as I had made in 
the fall in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, sent to me. * * * Of course you would not suppose, if I had you 
come out here and work for me six weeks, I would not pay your expenses and pay you as you 
made each dress. The probability is that I shall need more clothes ; my rest, I am inclined to 
believe, is near at hand. Go to B. & K., and have my clothes sent me without further publicity. ~* * I am feeling too weak to 
write more to-day. Why are you so silent ? For the sake of humanity, if not me and my children, 
do not have those black clothes displayed in Europe. The thought has almost whitened 
every hair of my head. Write when you receive this.
