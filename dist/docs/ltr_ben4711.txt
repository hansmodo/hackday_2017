DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have before me your favours of April 23, May 21 and 26. 
The confusion among our great men still continues as much 
as ever, and a melancholy thing it is to consider, that, instead 
of employing the present leisure of peace in such measures 
as might extend our commerce, pay off our debts, secure allies, 
and increase the strength and ability of the nation to support 
a future war, the whole seems to be wasted in party contentions about places of power and profit, in court intrigues 
and cabals, and in abusing one another. 
</p><p>
There has lately been an attempt to make a kind of coalition 
of parties in a new ministry, but it fell through, and the present set is like to continue for some time longer, which I am 
rather pleased with, as some of those who were proposed to 
be introduced are professed adversaries to America, which 
is now made one of the distinctions of party here ; those who 
have in the two last sessions shown a disposition to favour 
us, being called by way of reproach, Americans; while the 
others, adherents to Grenville and Bedford, value themselves on being true to the interests of Britain, and zealous for 
maintaining its dignity and sovereignty over the colonies. 
</p><p>
This distinction will, it is apprehended, be carried much 
higher in the next session, for the political purpose of influencing the ensuing election. It is already given out that the 
compliance of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, in providing for the quarters, without taking notice of its being done in obedience to the act 
of Parliament, is evasive and unsatisfactory. That it is high 
time to put the right and power of this country to tax the colonies out of dispute, by an act of taxation, effectually carried 
into execution, and that all the colonies should be obliged 
explicitly to acknowledge that right. Every step is taking to 
render the taxing America a popular measure here, by continually insisting on the topics of our wealth and flourishing 
circumstances, while this country is loaded with debt, great 
part of it incurred on our account, the distress of the poor here 
by the multitude and weight of taxes, &c. &c. ; and though 
the traders and manufacturers may possibly be kept in our 
interest, the idea of an American tax is very pleasing to the 
landed men, who therefore readily receive and propagate 
these sentiments wherever they have influence. 
</p><p>
If such a bill should be brought in, it is hard to say what 
would be the event of it, or what would be the effects. Those 
who oppose it, though they should be strong enough to throw 
it out, would be stigmatized as Americans, betrayers of Old 
England, &c., and perhaps, our friends by this means being 
excluded, a majority of our adversaries may get in, and then 
the act infallibly passes the following session. To avoid the 
danger of such exclusion, perhaps little opposition will be 
given, and then it passes immediately. I know not what to 
advise on this occasion, but that we should all do our endeavours on both sides the water to lessen the present unpopularity of the American cause, conciliate the affections of 
people here towards us, increase by all possible means the 
number of our friends, and be careful not to weaken their 
hands and strengthen those of our enemies, by rash proceedings on our side, the mischiefs of which are inconceivable. 
Some of our friends have thought that a publication of my 
Examination here, might answer some of the above purposes, 
by removing prejudices, refuting falsehoods, and demonstrating our merits with regard to this country. It is accordingly 
printed, and has a great run. I have another piece in hand, 
which I intend to put out about the time of the meeting of 
Parliament, if those I consult with shall judge that it may be 
of service. 
</p><p>
The next session of Parliament will probably be a short 
one, on account of the following election. And I am now 
advised by some of our great friends here to see that out, not 
returning to America till the spring. My presence indeed 
is necessary there to settle some private affairs. Unforeseen 
and unavoidable difficulties have hitherto obstructed our 
proceedings in the main intent of my coming over, and perhaps (though I think my being here has not been altogether 
unserviceable) our friends in the Assembly may begin to be 
discouraged and tired of the expense. If that should be the 
case, I would not have you propose to continue me as agent at 
the meeting of the new Assembly: my endeavours to serve 
the province, in what I may while I remain here, shall not be 
lessened by that omission. 
</p><p>
I am glad you have made a trial of paper money, not a legal 
tender. The quantity being small, may perhaps be kept in 
full credit notwithstanding ; and if that can be avoided, I am 
not for applying here again very soon for a repeal of the restraining act. I am afraid an ill use will be made of it. The 
plan of our adversaries is to render Assemblies in America 
useless ; and to have a revenue independent of their grants, 
for all the purposes of their defence, and supporting governments among them. It is our interest to prevent this. And, 
that they may not lay hold of our necessities for paper money, 
to draw a revenue from that article, whenever they grant us 
the liberty we want, of making it a legal tender, I wish some 
other method may be fallen upon of supporting its credit. 
What think you of getting all the merchants, traders, and 
principal people of all sorts, to join in petitions to the Assembly for a moderate emission, the petition being accompanied 
with a mutual engagement to take it in all dealings at the rates 
fixed by law? Such an engagement had a great effect in 
fixing the value and rates of our gold and silver. Or, perhaps, 
a bank might be established that would answer all purposes. 
Indeed I think with you, that those merchants here, who have 
made difficulties on the subject of the legal tender, have not 
understood their own interest. For there can be no doubt, 
that should a scarcity of money continue among us, we shall 
take off less of their merchandise, and attend more to manufacturing, and raising the necessaries and superfluities of life 
among ourselves, which we now receive from them. And 
perhaps this consequence would attend our making no paper 
money at all of any sort, that being thus by want of cash 
driven to industry and frugality, we should gradually become 
more rich without their trade, than we can possibly be with 
it, and, by keeping in the country the real cash that comes 
into it, have in time a quantity sufficient for all our occasions. 
But I suppose our people will scarce have patience to wait for 
this. 
</p><p>
I have received the printed votes, but not the laws. I hear 
nothing yet of any objection made by the Proprietaries to any 
of them at the Board of Trade. 
</p><p>
Please to present my duty to the Assembly, with thanks for 
their care of me, and assure them of my most faithful services. 
With sincerest esteem and respect, I am, my dear friend, 
yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
