Yes Aunt Lerie was married to Russell Theller my maternal grandfather's
brother (Sumter Theller).  We always really liked her as she ALWAYS sent us
a dollar in our birthday cards which was BIG money for us.  The banana bread
recipe I use and Grandma always used is from Aunt Lerie.

She was old and bedridden when I knew her.  They lived on Carroll Street in
Sunnyvale.  Uncle Russell had beautiful gardens and looked different.  To me
he looked down syndrome but I never heard any discussion of any medical
condition he may have had.  Their house burned down in a fire and they lived
in their garage.  It was two rooms a living area/kitchen and a bedroom.
Aunt Lerie  was always in bed when we went to see her.  The house always had
a very strong odor and we did not like to go in.  She may have had arthritis
or something and the odor was from some sort of salve - I don't know.

My Mother really loved Aunt Lerie and would sometimes tell stories about the
quake and S.F. and Aunt Lerie.  Aunt Lerie was a nurse.

Ross might remember more about her as he was older although he never lived
close to her.

Kathy,
Heidi found an old letter from Lois to Grandma (Ruth)
that was pretty interesting. In the letter Lois
mentioned having lunch with Aunt Learie in SF. I
remember you mentioned aunt learie having been in the
quake of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1906">1906</a> - she sounds like an interesting person.
Do you still remember much about her? Was she an old
lady when you knew her?

Thanks,
Hans
