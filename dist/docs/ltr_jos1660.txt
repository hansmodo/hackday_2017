My Dear Brother : I received your recent letter in which 
you mention your position on the morning of Sunday 
very opportunely. 
</p><p>
It arrived on the morning I had to make a speech on 
Ohio volunteers. The imputations, whether just or unjust, 
upon our regiments make it necessary in the opinion of 
our delegation that someone should speak, and I did so. 
I was exceedingly anxious for your report and went or 
sent to the Adjutant General's office daily for several 
days, but was informed that none of the details or division reports had come, although several were published 
in the newspapers. I collected all the information I 
could and made my speech. Whether I am in a mile of 
the truth is mere chance, but I believe my statement is 
more accurate than any made. Read it and let me know. 
You will see from Harlan's remarks there is much feeling against Grant and I try to defend him, but with little 
success. Why is not your report sent in ? Pray hereafter have a copy sent to me of all future reports. . . . 
</p><p>
I never spoke under greater embarrassment than I did 
yesterday. It was a delicate subject, upon which my constituents were sensitive, and yet I was in ignorance how 
far your reply would overthrow me. . . . 
</p><p>
As to your personal position you need not fear. Halleek's opinion about your action of Sunday is the opinion 
of the country. You are as likely to be abused on my 
account as on your own. I am so accustomed to stqrms 
of factious opposition as to be perfectly serene under it. 
I hope you will become so. 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
