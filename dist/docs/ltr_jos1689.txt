Gentlemen: The publication in your paper yesterday 
of General Sherman's note to the President, and its 
simultaneous transmission by telegraph unaccompanied 
by subsequent letters withheld by the President because 
they were "private," is so unfair as to justify severe 
censure upon the person who furnished you this letter, 
whoever he may be. Upon its face it is an informal 
private note dictated by the purest motives, a desire to 
preserve harmony, and not intended for publication. 
How any gentleman receiving such a note could first 
allow vague but false suggestions of its contents to be 
given out, and then print it, and withhold other letters because they were "private," with a view to create 
the impression that General Sherman in referring to 
ulterior measures suggested the violent expulsion of a 
high officer from his office, passes my comprehension. 
Still I know that General Sherman is so sensitive upon 
questions of official propriety in publishing papers, that 
he would rather suffer from this false inference than to 
correct it by publishing another private note; and as I 
knew that this letter was not the only one written by 
General Sherman to the President about Mr. Stanton, I 
applied to the President for his consent to publish subsequent letters. This consent was freely given by the 
President, and I therefore send copies to you and ask 
their publication. 
</p><p>
These copies are furnished me from official sources; 
for while I know General Sherman's opinions, yet he did 
not show me either of the letters to the President, 
during his stay here, nervously anxious to promote harmony, to avoid strife, and certainly never suggested or 
countenanced resistance to law or violence in any 
form. He no doubt left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> with his old repugnance to politics, politicians, and newspapers very much 
increased by his visit here.
