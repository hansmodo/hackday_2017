I congratulate you my dear Sir on our well timed success at Trenton. I trust the honor of our arms will be retrieved. 
</p><p>
Our levies go on pretty well in many places ; in some the great want of necessary clothing & blankets, retards them. Orders issue this day for 
the officers to hold themselves & soldiers ready to march by companies & parts of companies, &lt;fe in a little time they ll go off, but in want of every thing. 
</p><p>
I observe our people (a few excepted) are firm &&amp;gt; not to be shaken. A great number of volunteers may be had. I hope all the enlistments mayz 
be filled, but doubt if it can soon be done. I am endeavoring at vigorus measures. Languor seems to have been diffused thro the Naval department. 
However I hope it will mend. The Cherokees are humbled, but I fear hostility about Pittsburg in the spring, &lt;fe have provided ammunition and provisions in that quarter, &&amp;gt; shall be able to muster a 
formidable militia thereabouts. The powder is not yet sent, but I wait only for the result of a council of war where to deposit it. Our sea coasts are 
defenceless almost. Arms & woolens are wanted here most extremely. We are making efforts to secure them. I do indeed pity your situation. I 
guess at the many perplexities & difficulties that attend you. I know how much the vigorous counsels of America are indebted to you for their support. 
I know how much you detest the spirit of indecision and lukewarmness that has exposed our country to so much peril. Let me tell you that altho your 
fatigue is almost too much to bear, yet you must hold out a little longer. Many people pretend they perceive errors in Congress, &&amp;gt; some wicked ones 
are greatly pleased at the hopes of seeing the respect due to that assembly succeeded by contempt. 
</p><p>
Make my most affe. compliments to Col. Frank. Has he forgot me? Indeed he may ask me the same. Tell him that from morning till night I 
have not a minute from business. I wish it may all do, for there are a thousand things to mend, to begin. 
</p><p>
Adieu my dear Sir, & believe me your affectionate, humble servant, u p h

P.S. I beg you ll tell me what is the best method for doing justice to Gen. Stephen as to his rank. I think he ought to be raised above his present rank.
