HEADQUARTERS STH Div., May 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>.

CAMP BEFORE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a>. 
</p><p>
My Dear Brother : . . . I was gratified on Monday 
'when I came in contact with my old Kentucky command. They gathered around me and were evidently 
pleased to meet me again, officers and men. I think Mr. 
Lincoln is a pure minded, honest and good man. I have 
all faith in him. . . . 
</p><p>
I think it is a great mistake to stop enlistments. 
There may be enough soldiers on paper, but not enough 
in fact. My aggregate, present and absent, is 10,452. 
Present for duty, 5,298 ; absent sick, 2,557 ; absent 
wounded, 855. The rest are on various detached duties, 
as teamsters or hospital attendance, embracing about 600 
sick in camp. 
</p><p>
About this proportion will run through the whole 
army. I have not really one thorough soldier in my 
whole army. They are all green and raw. . . . 
</p><p>
Last evening I had to post my own pickets and come 
under the fire of the enemies' pickets. Came near being 
hit. Of course, being mounted and ahead, I and staff 
always get an undue share of attention. 
</p><p>
I made my official report on the battle of the 6th and 
7th on the llth of April, sent it to Grant, and he to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a>. It has not been published and it is none of 
my business. An officer ought not to publish anything. 
His report is to the Government, may contain confidential matters, and the War Department alone should have 
the discretion to publish or not, according to the interests 
of Government. . . . 
</p><p>
I have been worried to death by the carelessness of 
officers and sentinels ; have begged, importuned, and 
cursed to little purpose; and I will not be held responsible for the delinquencies of sentinels fresh from home, 
with as much idea of war as children. All I know is, 
we had our entire front, immediate guards and grand 
guards, and I had all my command in line of battle well 
selected before we had seen an infantry soldier of the 
enemy. We had been skirmishing with the cavalry for 
several days, and we could not get behind them. All we 
could see was the head of their column, and that admirably qualified by familiarity of the country for the purpose of covering an approach. 
</p><p>
Grant had been expecting Buell a whole week before 
he arrived. We all knew the enemy was in our front, 
but we had to guess at his purpose. Now that it is 
known, all are prophets ; but before, we were supposed 
to be a vast aggressive force sent by an intelligent Government to invade the South, and for us to have been 
nervous on the subject would have indicated weakness. 
Beauregard then performed the very thing which Johnston should have done in Kentucky last October. 
</p><p>
My force was divided ; he could have interposed his, 
attacked McCook at Nolin and Thomas at London, and 
would have defeated us with perfect ease. The secessionists would then have had Kentucky and Missouri 
both. Why he did not is a mystery to me. And Buckner told me that Johnston's neglect on that occasion was 
so galling to him that he made him give a written order 
not to attempt to manoeuvre. . . . 
</p><p>
We are now encamped six miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a>, pickets 
about one mile and a half in advance. I am on the 
extreme right, McClernand is in my rear and guards off 
to the right. The roads are again pretty good and I 
don't bother myself about the plans and aims of our generals. I will do all I can with my division, but regret 
that I have not better discipline and more reliable men. 
Too many of the officers are sick of the war and have 
gone home on some pretence or other. I am in pretty 
good health and keep close to my work. The success of 
our arms at Norfolk and Williamsburg are extraordinary 
and may result in peace sooner than I calculated. All I 
fear is that though we progress we find plenty of push 
everywhere. Weather begins to be hot. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
