My Precious Annie:  I take advantage of your gracious permission to
write to you, and there is no telling how far my feelings might carry
men were I not limited by the conveyance furnished by the Mim's [His
pet name for my mother] letter, which lies before me, and which must,
the Mim says so, go in this morning's mail.  But my limited time does
not diminish my affection for you, Annie, nor prevent my thinking of
you and wishing for you.  I long to see you through the dilatory nights.
At dawn when I rise, and all day, my thoughts revert to you in
expressions that you cannot hear or I repeat.  I hope you will always
appear to me as you are now painted on my heart, and that you will
endeavor to improve and so conduct yourself as to make you happy and
me joyful all our lives.  Diligent and earnest attention to ALL your
duties can only accomplish this.  I am told you are growing very tall,
and I hope very straight.  I do not know what the Cadets will say if
the Superintendent's CHILDREN do not practice what he demands of them.
They will naturally say he had better attend to his own before he
corrects other people's children, and as he permits his to stoop it
is hard he will not allow them.  You and Agnes [His third daughter]
must not, therefore, bring me into discredit with my young friends,
or give them reason to think that I require more of them than of my
own.  I presume your mother has told all about us, our neighbors, and
our affairs.  And indeed she may have done that and not said much
either, so far as I know.  But we are all well and have much to be
grateful for.  To-morrow we anticipate the pleasure of your brother's
[His son, Custis] company, which is always a source of pleasure to us.
It is the only time we see him, except when the Corps come under my
view at some of their exercises, when my eye is sure to distinguish
him among his comrades and follow him over the plain.  Give much love
to your dear grandmother, grandfather, Agnes, Miss Sue, Lucretia, and
all friends, including the servants.  Write sometimes, and think always
of your
</p><p>
                                         Affectionate father,<br/>
                                               R. E. Lee.
