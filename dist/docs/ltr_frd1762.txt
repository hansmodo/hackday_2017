MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">MRS. KECKLEY</a> : I very easily read your handwriting. With practice you will not 
only write legibly but elegantly ; so no more apologies for bad writing. Penmanship has 
always been one of my own deficiencies, and I know how to sympathize with you. 
</p><p>
I am just home, and find your letter awaiting me. You should have received an earlier answer 
but for this absence. I am sorry it will be impossible for me to see you before I go to Washington. I am leaving home this week for Ohio, 
and shall go from Ohio to Washington. I shall be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> a day or two after my visit to 
Washington, and will see you there. Any public demonstration in which it will be desirable for 
me to take part, ought to come off the last of this month or the first of next. I thank you sincerely 
for the note containing a published letter of dear Mrs. Lincoln ; both letters do credit to the excellent lady. I prize her beautiful letter to me very 
highly. It is the letter of a refined and spirited lady, let the world say what it will of her. I would write her a word of acknowledgment but 
for fear to burden her with, correspondence. I am glad that Mr. Garnet arid yourself saw Mr. Greeley, and that he takes the right view of the 
matter ; but we want more than right views, and delay is death to the movement. What you now 
want is action and co-operation. If Mr. Brady does not for any reason find himself able to move 
the machinery, somebody else should be found to take his place ; he made a good impression on 
me when I saw him, but I have not seen the promised simultaneous movement of which we 
spoke when together. This whole thing should be in the hands of some recognized solid man in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. ~No man would be better than Mr. Greeley ; no man in the State is more laughed at, 
and yet no man is more respected and trusted; a dollar placed in his hands would be as safe for 
the purpose as in a burglar-proof safe, and what is better still, everybody believes this. This testimonial must be more than a negro testimonial. 
It is a great national duty. Mr. Lincoln did everything for the black man, but he did it not 
for the black man s sake, but for the nation's sake. His life was given for the nation ; but for 
being President, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="met">Mr. Lincoln</a> would have been alive, and Mrs. Lincoln would have been a wife, 
and not a widow as now. Do all you can, dear Mrs. Keckley nobody can do more than you in 
removing the mountains of prejudice towards that good lady, and opening the way of success in the plan. 
</p><p>
I am, dear madam, very truly yours,
