<p><i>[Biographer's note: I had before this time gone to my farm in King William County and
started out in life as a farmer.  As there was nothing but the land
and a few old buildings left, for several years I had a very up-hill
time.  My father encouraged, advised me, and gave me material aid.
His letters to me at this time will show the interest he took in my
welfare.  In one written March 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1866">1866</a>, after advising me as to steps
to be taken in repairing an old mill on the place, he writes: ]</i></p>

<p><q>I am clear for your doing everything to improve your property and make
it remunerative as far as you can.  You know my objections to incurring
debt.  I cannot overcome it....  I hope you will overcome your chills,
and by next winter you must patch up your house, and get a sweet wife.
You will be more comfortable, and not so lonesome.  Let her bring a
cow and a churn.  That will be all you will want....  Give my love
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfl" rel="child met">Fitzhugh</a>.  I wish he were regularly established.  He cannot afford
to be idle.  He will be miserable.</q></p>

<p><i>[Biographer's note: My brother Fitzhugh, here referred to, was negotiating to rent his
farm, the White House, to some so-called English capitalists, and had
not as yet established himself.]</i></p>
