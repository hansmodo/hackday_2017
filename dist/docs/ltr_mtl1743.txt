MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">KECKLEY</a> : Your last letter has been received, and believe me, I duly appreciate your 
great interest in my affairs. I hope the day may arrive when I can return your kindness in more 
than words. As you are aware of my beloved husband's great indulgence to me in pecuniary 
matters, thereby allowing me to indulge in be stowing favors on those whom I considered wor 
thy of it, it is in this respect I feel chiefly the humiliation of my small circumscribed income. 
If Congress, or the Ration, had given me the four years salary, I should have been able to live as 
the widow of the great <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="met spouse">President Lincoln</a> should, with sufficient means to give liberally to all bene 
volent objects, and at my death should have left at least half of it to the freedmen, for the liberty 
of whom his precious sacred life was sacrificed. The men who prevented this being done by their 
villanous unscrupulous falsehoods, are no friends of the colored race, and, as you well know, have 
led Johnson on in his wicked course. 
</p><p>
God is just and the day of retribution will come to all such, if not in this world, in the great 
hereafter, to which those hoary-headed sinners are so rapidly hastening, with an innocent conscience. 
I did not feel it necessary to raise my weak woman's voice against the persecutions that have 
assailed me emanating from the tongues of such men as Weed & Co. I have felt that their infamous false lives was a sufficient vindication of my 
character. They have never forgiven me for standing between my pure and noble husband and 
themselves, when, for their own vile purposes, they would have led him into error. All this 
the country knows, and why should I dwell longer on it? In the blissful home where my 
worshipped husband dwells God is ever merciful, and it is the consolation of my broken heart that 
my darling husband is ever retaining the devoted love which he always so abundantly manifested 
for his wife and children in this life. I feel assured his watchful, loving eyes are always watch ing over us, and he is fully aware of the wrong 
and injustice permitted his family by a country he lost his life in protecting. I write earnestly, 
because I feel very deeply. It appears to me a very remarkable coincidence, that most of the 
good feeling regarding irfy straitened circumstances proceeds from the colored people, in 
whose cause my noble husband was so largely interested. Whether we are successful or not, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=frd" rel="met friend">Mr. F. Douglass</a> and Mr. Garnet will always have 
my most grateful thanks. They are very noble men. If any favorable results should crown their 
efforts, you may well believe at my death, what ever sum it may be, will be bequeathed to the 
colored people, who are very near my heart. In yesterday's paper it was announced that Gov. Andrew's family were having $100,000 contributed to them. Gov. A. was a good man, but 
what did he do compared to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="met spouse">President Lincoln</a>? Right and left the latter gave, when he had but 
little to bestow, and in consequence his family are 
now feeling it ; yet for my life I would not recall a dollar he ever gave. Yet his favorite ex 
pression, when I have playfully alluded to the c rainy day that might be in store for himself 
and his own on several occasions, he has looked at me so earnestly and replied, Cast your bread 
upon the waters. Although the petty sum of $22,000 was an insufficient return for Congress to 
make me, and allowanced to its meagreness by men who traduced and vilified the loved wife of 
the great man who made them, and from whom they amassed great fortunes for Weed, and Sewardj and R. did this last. And yet, all this 
was permitted by an American people, who owed their remaining a nation to my husband! I have 
dwelt too long on this painful subject, but when I have been compelled from a pitiful income to 
make a boarding-house of my home, as I now am doing, think you that it does not rankle in my heart

Fortunately, with my husband's great, great love for me the knowledge of this future for his 
petted and idolized wife was spared him, and yet I feel in my heart he knows it all. Mr. Sumner, 
the intimate friend of better days, called to see me two or three weeks since he who had been 
an habitue of the White House both the rooms of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="met spouse">President</a> and my own reception-room, in 
either place he was always sure of a heartfelt welcome ; my present situation must have struck a 
painful chord in his noble, sympathizing heart. And yet, when I endeavored to ameliorate my condition, the cry has been so fearful against me as to 
cause me to forget my own identity, and suppose I had plundered the nation, indeed, and committed murder. This, certainly, cannot be America, 
the land of the free? the home of the brave? The evening before Mr. Sumner's last call I had 
received <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=frd" rel="met friend">Mr. Douglass's</a> letter ; I mentioned the circumstance to Mr. Sumner, who replied : Mr. Frederick Douglass is a very noble, talented man, 
and I know of no one who writes a more beautiful letter. I am sending you a long letter, 
Lizzie, but I rely a great deal on your indulgence. My fear is that you will not be able to decipher 
the scrawl written so hastily.

I remain, truly yours,
