My Precious Daughters:  I have just received your letters of the 24th
and am rejoiced to hear that you are well and enjoying the company of
your friends....  It rains here all the time, literally.  There has
not been sunshine enough since my arrival to dry my clothes.  Perry
[his servant--had been in the dining-room at Arlington] is my washerman,
and socks and towels suffer.  But the worst of the rain is that the
ground has become so saturated with water that the constant travel on
the roads has made them almost impassable, so that I cannot get up
sufficient supplies for the troops to move. It is raining now.  Has
been all day, last night, day before, and day before that, etc., etc.
But we must be patient.  It is quite cool, too.  I have on all my
winter clothes and am writing in my overcoat.  All the clouds seem
to concentrate over this ridge of mountains, and by whatever wind they
are driven, give us rain.  The mountains are magnificent.  The sugar-
maples are beginning to turn already, and the grass is luxuriant.

'Richmond' [His horse] has not been accustomed to such fare or such
treatment.  But he gets along tolerably, complains some, and has not
much superfluous flesh.  There has been much sickness among the men--
measles, etc.--and the weather has been unfavourable.  I hope their
attacks are nearly over, and that they will come out with the sun.
Our party has kept well....  Although we may be too weak to break
through the lines, I feel well satisfied that the enemy cannot at
present reach Richmond by either of these routes, leading to Staunton,
Milborough or Covington.  He must find some other way....  God Bless
you, my children, and preserve you from all harm is the constant
prayer of
</p><p>
                              Your devoted father,
</p>
