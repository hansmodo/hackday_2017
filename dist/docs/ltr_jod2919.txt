I NEVER fail to enclose to you the newspapers, which contain the most of the intelligence that comes to my knowledge. I am obliged to slacken my attention to 
business a little, and ride and walk for the sake of my health, which is but infirm. O ! that I could wander upon Perm's hill and in the meadows and mountains 
in its neighborhood, free from care ! But this is a felicity too great for me.

Mr. Gorham and Mr. Russel are here with a petition from Charlestown. It grieves me that they are to 
return without success. I feel, most exquisitely, for the unhappy people of that town. Their agents have 
done every thing in their power or in the power of men to do, and the Massachusetts delegates have seconded their efforts to the utmost of their power, but all in vain. The distress of the States, arising from the quantity of money abroad, and the monstrous demands that would be made from Virginia, New Jersey, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and elsewhere, if a precedent should be once set, has determined the Congress, almost with 
tears in their eyes, to withstand this application at present. Every man expressed the utmost tenderness and humanity upon the occasion : but at the some 
time, every man, except the Massachusetts delegates, expressed his full conviction of the ill policy of granting any thing at present.
