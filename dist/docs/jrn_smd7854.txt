I believe I forgot to mention one little circumstance 
in my account of that first night at the Deaf and 
Dumb Asylum, which at the time struck me with 
extreme disgust. That was seeing more than one 
man who had no females or babies to look after, who 
sought there a refuge from the coming attack. At 
daylight, one dapper young man, in fashionable 
array, came stepping lightly on the gallery, carrying 
a neat carpet-bag in his hand. I hardly think he expected to meet two young ladies at that hour; I 
shall always believe he meant to creep away before 
any one was up ; for he certainly looked embarrassed 
when we looked up, though he assumed an air of 
indifference, and passed by bravely swinging his 
sack but I think he wanted us to believe he was 
not ashamed. I dare say it was some little clerk in 
his holiday attire; but I can't say what contempt I 
felt for the creature.

Honestly, I believe the women of the South are as 
brave as the men who are fighting, and certainly 
braver than the " Home Guard." I have not yet been 
able to coax myself into being as alarmed as many 
I could name are. They say it is because I do not 
know the danger. Soil. I prefer being brave through 
ignorance, to being afraid in consequence of my 
knowledge of coming events. Thank Heaven, my 
brothers are the bravest of the brave! I would 
despise them if they shrunk back, though Lucifer 
should dispute the path with them. Well! All men 
are not Morgan boys! They tell me cowards actu 
ally exist, though I hope I never met one. The poor 
men that went to the Asylum for safety might not 
have what Lavinia calls "a moral backbone." No 
wonder, then, they tumbled in there! Besides, I am 
told half the town spent the night on the banks of the 
river, on that occasion; and perhaps these unfortu 
nates were subject to colds, and preferred the shelter 
of a good roof. Poor little fellows ! How I longed to 
give them my hoops, corsets, and pretty blue 
organdie in exchange for their boots and breeches ! 
Only I thought it was dangerous; for suppose the 
boots had been so used to running that they should 
prance off with me, too? Why, it would ruin my rep 
utation! Miss Morgan in petticoats is thought to be 
"as brave as any other man"; but these borrowed 
articles might make her fly as fast "as any other 
man," too, if panic is contagious, as the Yankees 
here have proved. One consolation is, that all who could go with any propriety, and all who were worthy 
of fighting, among those who believed in the South, are off at the seat of war; it is only trash, and those 
who are obliged to remain for private reasons, who still remain. Let us count those young individuals 
as trash, and step over them. Only ask Heaven why you were made with a man's heart, and a female 
form, and those creatures with beards were made as bewitchingly nervous?
