YESTERDAY I dined with Captain Richards, the gentle 
man who made me the present of the brass pistols. 
We had cherries, strawberries and green peas in plenty. 
The fruits are three weeks earlier here, than with 
you. Indeed, they are a fortnight earlier on the east, 
than on the west side of Delaware river. We have hadgreen peas this week past, but they were brought 
over the river, from New Jersey, to this market. 
There are none grown in the city, or on the west side 
of the river yet. The reason is, the soil of New Jersey is a warm sand ; that of Pennsylvania a cold clay. 
So much for peas and berries.

Now for something of more importance. In all the 
correspondence I have maintained, during a course 
of twenty years, at least, that I have been a writer of 
letters, I never kept a single copy. This negligence 
and inaccuracy has been a great misfortune to me on 
many occasions. I have now purchased a folio book, 
in the first page of which, excepting one blank leaf, I 
am writing this letter, and intend to write all my letters to you in it, from this time forward. This will 
be an advantage to me in several respects. In the 
first place, I shall write more deliberately. In the 
second place, I shall be able, v at all times, to review 
what I have written. Third, I shall know how often 
I write. Fourth, I shall discover by this means, whether 
any of toy letters to you miscarry. If it were possible for me to find a conveyance, I would send you 
such another blank book as a present, that you might begin the practice at the same time, for I really think 
that your letters are much better worth preserving than mine. Your daughter and sons will very soon 
write so good hands, that they will copy the letters for you from your book, which will improve them, at the same time that it relieves you.
