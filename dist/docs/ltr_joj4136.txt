Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have lately received much intelligence from several quarters. Some allowances are 
to be made for zeal ; but all my accounts agree in representing the public mind as becoming more and more composed, and that certain virulent publications have caused 
great and general indignation, even among many who had 
been misled into intemperate proceedings, and had given 
too much countenance to factious leaders. The latter, 
however, persevere with great activity, though with less 
noise and clamour. These are political evils, which, in all 
ages, have grown out of such a state of things, as naturally 
as certain physical combinations produce whirlwinds and 
meteors. 
</p><p>
With perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 
I am, my dear sir, 
Your obliged and affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
