<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='31'>31st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Met Preston Hampton. Constance Cary was with me. She showed her regard for him by taking his overcoat and leaving him in a drenching rain. What boyish nonsense he talked ; said he was in love with Miss Dabney now, that his love was so hot within him that he was 
waterproof, the rain sizzed and smoked off. It did not so much as dampen his ardor or his clothes.
