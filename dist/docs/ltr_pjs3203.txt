DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Colonel Warner is on the Grants, with a small body of Continental troops and some militia, and expects to be reinforced in a 
day or two by General Stark, with a body of militia from New 
Hampshire. 
</p><p>
You will please to repair to Manchester, the place where the 
troops above mentioned are collected and collecting, and take the 
command of the whole. As <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> is advancing 
towards us, and as a movement of a body of troops from the 
Grants towards Skenesborough will doubtless much embarrass 
him, and will certainly oblige him to have a considerable force 
at that place, you will move towards it, if the troops you should 
find there, or those that may join, are in such numbers as that 
you can do it without risking too much. 
</p><p>
You will please to advise me, from time to time, of your situation and force, that I may be enabled to direct your future 
operations, according to what information I may get of the enemy's intentions. It is impossible to be more explicit in the present state of affairs. Events may arise, to which these orders 
could not possibly apply; you will, therefore, consider them as 
merely discretionary, and exercise your own judgment as contingencies may arise. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, with great esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="me">PHILIP SCHUYLER</a>.
