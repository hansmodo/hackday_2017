DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
I have just received your last letter, also another written by you
about one month ago, which has followed me around until at length it
reached this place. I am very well, but have no news to communicate.
</p><p>
I had extended my lines nearly half way to Columbus and made
reconnoissances frequently to within sight of the rebel camps, but my
force has to be so reduced that it would be imprudent to make an
attack now until I am reinforced.
</p><p>
I hope some day, if I am allowed to retain this command, to give a
good account of ourselves. Simpson's death, though looked for for the
last two years, causes me a great deal of sadness. The day I heard of
it, I received a number of letters from Galena. In two or three of
them his arrival at St. Paul was noted, and it was stated that he was
no better. Our family has been peculiarly blessed up to this time. But
few families of the same number have gone so many years without the
loss of a single member.
</p><p>
I expect Father here as soon as Orvil returns to Galena.
</p>
BROTHER ULYS.
