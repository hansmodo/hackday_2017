DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
We got here Tuesday evening and are now pretty well settled. Can we not
expect Mr. Corbin, you, Mary and two children down to spend a few days
with us as soon as the latter arrives? If Mary does not come now, it is
not probable that she will get East again this summer. You can see just
as much of her here as you could at your own house; so I think the best
arrangement will be for you to come immediately here and all spend the
time together at the Branch. I will go up to meet you in the harbor if
informed in time.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.

<p>
P.S. I learned from a letter from St. Petersburg that Fred. hurried off
to Copenhagen to meet Mary before she left, which was to be the 1st day
of June. I infer from this that she should be here in two or three days
from now.
</p>
