My Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
I have, within these few days past, read and admired your address to the army, and their proceedings in consequence of it. Such instances of patriotism are rare, and 
America must find it difficult to express, in adequate terms, the gratitude she owes to both. Such a degree of glory
so virtuously acquired, and so decently sustained, is as new as our political constellation, and. will for ever give lustre to it. May every blessing be yours. 
</p><p>
Mr. Hartley has just informed me that orders have been sent to the British commander-in-chief to evacuate the 
United States. Our attention will then, I hope, be turned to the preservation and improvement of what we have 
gained; and a sense of the importance of that task leads me to wish that the execution of it may be facilitated by your counsels and application 
</p><p>
With perfect esteem and affection, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
