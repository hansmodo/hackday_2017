<a rel='month origin' value='7'>July</a> <a rel='day origin' value='14'>14th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Mr. Chesnut remained closeted with the President and <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a> all the afternoon. The news 
does not seem pleasant. At least, he is not inclined to tell me any of it. He satisfied himself with telling me how sensible and soldierly this handsome <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a> is. <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee's</a> military sagacity was also his theme. Of course the President dominated the party, as well by his weight of 
brain as by his position. I did not care a fig for a description of the war council. I wanted to know what is in 
the wind now ?
