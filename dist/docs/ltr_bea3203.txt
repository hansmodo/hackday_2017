DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 19th instant was delivered to me last evening, and I am happy to hear that you are well and have joined 
the army. I beg leave to congratulate you on our late success 
over the enemy by the troops commanded by General Stark. I 
make no doubt it will have a happy effect. 
</p><p>
I leave this place this morning with twelve hundred Continental troops, officers included, and a handful of militia, for Fort 
Schuyler, which is still besieged by a number equal to ours. 
Nothing shall be omitted that can be done to raise the siege. 
You will hear of my being victorious, or no more ; and, as soon 
as the safety of this part of the country will permit, I will fly to 
your assistance. 
</p><p>
General Herkimer died yesterday. I will make your compliments and return your thanks to the other gentlemen when I 
have the pleasure of seeing them. 
I am credibly informed that General St. Leger has sent to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> for a reinforcement. I believe it will not be 
in his power to spare them, except they have marched before the 
late action, which may be worth inquiring into. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
