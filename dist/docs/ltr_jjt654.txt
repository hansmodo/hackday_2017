My dear Sister
</p><p>
Your letter stating that you are teaching the children yourself has given me concern and I write this letter for the purpose of saying that you must never hesitate for a single moment about sending the children to me. I stated in my letter to you the conditions upon which I was ready to do for them what I could, because I felt it would prevent any disappointment to you & Mr. Arnold in the event of their coming, and I feel that I can make them comfortable & enable them to acquire a good education & to move in that sphere of life where I desire to see them move. Without a good education they must ever fall short of that position in life which they ought to occupy, and their early education consisting of spelling & reading is of great importance; if either is defective the education must necessarily be defective. But if insuperable objections lie in the way of getting a good teacher or of sending them abroad, don't give yourself anxiety but trust in our most kind & merciful Father who withholds no good thing from his children. I am very thankful to see you bear up under your trials with such Christian fortitude & as long as we lean on His almighty arm all shall be well.

I reached home on last Friday night about 3 o'clock in the morning. Anna is an invalid still, but I trust that better health is in store for her. My throat has been troubling me again in consequence of a cold contracted during my military excursion. I am thankful to you for engaging the [illegible] but I don't know when I will be able to bring them home. You must give my love to Aunt & Uncle White. Remember me very kindly to Mr. Arnold. Anna joins me in love to the children. Should you see any of Mr. Chenoweth's friends say to them that I saw him today, & that he is well.
