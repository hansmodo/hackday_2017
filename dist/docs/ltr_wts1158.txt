Dear Brother: 
</p><p>
Grant is as good a leader as we can find. He has 
honesty, simplicity of character, singleness of purpose, 
and no hope or claim to usurp civil power. His character, more than his genius, will reconcile armies and 
attach the people. Let him alone. Don't disgust him 
by flattery or importunity. Let him alone. ... If 
bothered, hampered, or embarrassed, he would drop you 
all in disgust, and let you slide into anarchy. . . . Let 
us manage the whites and " niggers " and all the physical 
resources of the country, and apply them where most 
needed. Let us accomplish great results, leaving small 
ones to conform in due season. . . . 
</p><p>
I have in hand three armies here, and one in Arkansas. All are in harmony, and all are willing to go and 
come at my bidding. I am also in perfect harmony with 
the civil authorities. I know their province and my 
own. I believe also our enemies have more respect for 
me than they have for Congress, so that I shall be ready 
with the spring. But I see with regret causes still at 
work North which should not be. States quarrelling 
about quotas, when we see their regiments here dwindling to mere squads. Absentees by the hundreds of 
thousands; and all efforts to get men, who have drawn 
large bounties and are drawing large pay still lingering 
at a safe distance, are vain, yet I hope that by the voluntary consent of the men themselves we shall have 
enough. 
</p><p>
As our enemy fills his ranks by conscription, ours 
dwindle by sickness and furloughs. I am laboring hard 
to put all on the rolls into position, and still harder to 
put forward the stores on which they must feed as we 
advance. The country through which we have marched 
is cleared of all subsistence and forage, and everything 
must be sent forward by cars and wagons. It is estimated that there are now the carcasses of thirty thousand animals in the valley of the Tennessee. Not one 
cavalry soldier in ten has a horse, and on a recent visit 
to Schofield, out of forty-one thousand men who should 
have, I find but seven thousand in line of battle, but the 
furloughed men are returningA and I will see that by 
May 1st I have on the Tennessee one of the best armies 
in the world. You may look ytor the causes of these 
apparent incongruities not in the army, but among our 
people. 
</p><p>
I shall be here about two weeks, and then to the front. 
Let me hear from you. I care no more for the squabbles 
about the Presidency than I do for the causes of the 
Schleswig-Holstein difficulty, and Grant cares still 
</p><p>
less. . . . 
</p><p>
Your brother, 
</p><p>
