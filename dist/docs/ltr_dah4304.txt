My dear General, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency some time ago from <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, and inclosed you the draft of a letter on the 
subject we talked of when I left <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. I 
hope you have duly received it, though I shall not 
be free from anxiety until I know with certainty that 
has been the case. 
</p><p>
When I wrote that letter, I was in hopes that it 
might have been in my power, before this time, to 
give you a favorable account of the complexion of 
politics in this State. It is true we have done some 
negative good ; we have prevented an emission of 
paper money and tender acts from taking place. But 
I am sorry to say, we have done nothing in aid of 
the Federal Government. The only requisition of Congress we have complied with, is a recent one for raising troops, on account of an Indian war, as is given 
out ; but some conjecture, for other purposes. The 
Assembly has this day given me the command of a 
regiment, part to be raised in this State, and a part 
in the other New England States. I have been advised by our friends to accept it for the present ; 
which I shall accordingly do. 
</p><p>
The troubles in Massachusetts still continue. Government is prostrated in the dust. And it is much 
to be feared that there is not energy enough in that 
State to reestablish the civil powers. The leaders of 
the mob, whose fortune and measures are desperate, 
are strengthening themselves daily; and it is expected that they will soon take possession of the Continental magazine at Springfield, in which there are 
from ten to fifteen thousand stand of arms, in excellent order. 
</p><p>
A general want of compliance with the requisitions of Congress for money, seems to prognosticate 
that we are rapidly advancing to a crisis. The wheels 
of the great political machine can scarcely continue 
to move much longer, under this present embarrassment. Congress, I am told, are seriously alarmed, 
and hardly know which way to turn, or what to expect. Indeed, my dear General, nothing but a good Providence can extricate us from our present difficulties, and prevent some terrible convulsion. 
</p><p>
In case of civil discord, I have already told you it 
was seriously my opinion that you could not remain 
neuter, and that you would be obliged, in self-defence, 
to take part on one side or the other, or withdraw 
from the Continent. Your friends are of the same 
opinion; and I believe you are convinced that it is 
impossible to have more disinterested and zealous 
friends than those who have been about your person. 
I write with the more confidence, as this letter 
will be delivered by Mr. Austin and Mr. Morse, two 
young clergymen, educated at this University, who 
are travelling to the southern part of the Union, for 
the sake of acquiring knowledge of their own country. I beg leave to recommend them to your civilities; and to assure you, in offering my best respects 
to Mrs. Washington and the family, how sincerely 
I am, my dear General, yours, &c., 
</p><p>
