My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your welcome & interesting letter of the 2 d ins was duly rec d for 
which you have my sincere thanks. I was very much gratified to hear 
that you had been restored to your usual health, which I trust you will 
continue to enjoy, & that you had recently heard from dear Ann, & that 
she & the children were all well ; if at a proper establishment I think 
Ann did right in sending Bob to the country, as it must have the effect 
of seperating him from those who not only set him bad examples, but 
lead him into many irregularities ; I agree with you that Ann had better 
remain quiet for the present, or until the fall, by which time many import 
ant changes may take place. No one can possibly take a deeper interest 
in all that concerns the wellfare of yourself & family than myself, & 
therefore when I offer you or them my advice, alth it may sometimes 
appear somewhat unpalatable, and may not even be for the best, yet it is 
intended it should be so, & at any rate is honestly given ; dispondency 
should never be given way to under any circumstances 
In a climate like this & under the circumstances we are placed in, 
there must be a great deal of disease, which as a matter of course must 
result in some deaths, & we will be fortunate indeed if no contagion gets 
among us that does not carry off hundreds ; I trust both the Gov r & 
Col C. are on the mend I truly regret to hear of the death of any 
one & especially of the wounded, the weather has been dreadful, & it is 
fortunate that more have not died. 
</p><p>
Should you determine on sending Bob to W. Point I wis your 
application may prove successful, I will give all the aid I can, which is 
very little As to Dr T. he never crosses my mind unless brought to 
my notice by some one so that I will dismiss him for the present. When 
one has the means to meet their real wants any where I cannot see the 
propriety or necessity of making themselves unhappy about matters & 
things of no real concern, there might be some reason for their doing so, 
was there a probability of their coming to want, which there is not the 
remotest posibility of in her case Economy I consider a virtue & 
should be practiced by all ; there is certainly no way in which money can 
be laid out than in the education of children. I think you should keep 
up your correspondence with Mower ; J besides much information may be 
gleaned by an interchang of opinions with such a man, he may be & at 
no distant day at the head of your dep 1 if so he will I hope do what is 
right & proper so far as you are concerned, as well as in all other cases 
I observe by the latest paper which reached here from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, the 
Tropic of the 29 th that England would offer her mediation to settle the 
difficulty between us and Mexico, if so I sincerely hope there will soon 
be peace between the two countries, in which case that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> will 
make no app ts of Gen & Staff officers under the late law, as it would 
have the effect of disbanding some of us, & I for one have no wish to 
be dropped, nor have I any to be promoted & retained at the expense of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> or Gaines ; notwithstanding it may be the case, and I will not 
suffer myself to believe that any obstacles will be thrown my way in the 
war, to prevent my prosecuting the war with energy, at least I hope not ; 
yet it would seem so from the way things have been managed ; boats 
appear to be now rapidly getting here at this time & I hope soon to have 
supplies to enable me to move at at any rate <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo rel="city">Camargo</a> ; : & nothing but 
peace will arrest my progress into the enemies country after I am fully 
ready to move, which I hope will be towards the last of the present 
month Col Whiting is now here, & I am satisfied will do all he can 
to forward my views ; I shall speak to Col W. about having the Long 
fitted up at once, or as soon as it can be done. Col Taylor will no doubt 
be here very shortly, & may bring something of interest from Washing 
ton, as well as of interest to you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a>. Neither Genl 8 Gaines or 
Scott has added to their reputation by publishing their corresponcence, & 
I think they will live to regreat their course. Gen S. will never hear 
the last of a fire from his rear, or a hasty plate of soup If Leonidas 
Waker is in the country he must be with the Mississippi people ; I hope 
however he has thought better of it & remained at home. I agree with 
you in doubting the reorganization of the Texans, I feel but little interest 
in the matter ; alth I expect if they could be made subordinate they 
would be the best, at any rate as good as any volunteer corps in ser 
vice ; but I fear they are & will continue too licentious to do much good. 
I hope you will give them all the medical aid in your power as well as to 
supply them with medicines and hospital stores as long as they can be 
spared ; I hope the tents have arrived ere now & that those people have 
been supplied with enough to protect them from the weather ; I am 
pleased to learn the Gov rl is satisfied that all that could be was done for 
them

Alth Mrs. Page has had a hard time of it, yet I hear she has ere 
now joined the Cap & without further accidents 
</p><p>
It seems to be a very difficult matter to get pay masters in the 
country or keep them here after their arrival ; Denny is now the only 
one in the country, there are for the number fully as many abuses in that 
dep c as there are in the medical or any other if not more 
</p><p>
I hope we will be soon able to put the volunteers in motion & keep 
them moveing so far as it is necesssry for the benefit of their health. If 
Hay will come up & let me know the number & strength of his comp s 
I will assign them transportation & soon put them in motion I have 
been looking for Gov r Henderson or for some one from him for several 
days 
</p><p>
I am very much pleased to find the Oregon question has been 
settled, & I think on correct principles & hope those with Mexico will 
very soon follow 
</p><p>
I send you down by Majr Craig a check on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> for four hun 
dred dollars as I have no use for it you can send it to your brother to 
have invested or anything else as you may think best My respects to 
Majr M., Capt. Ramsey & Dr. Wells & best regards to all inquiring 
friends. 
</p><p>
Yours truly

Dick got here day before yesterday ; if he has learned nothing else 
he has learned to chew, to use tobacco We have no news from the 
interior.
