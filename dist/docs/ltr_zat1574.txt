My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
The mail which has just arrived after being without one for 26 or 7 
days, brought me your welcome letters of the 8th  14th  15th  & 2o th ult with 
the newspapers scraps &c which you were so good as to forward, for all 
of which I am greatly indebted to you. I was very much pleased as well 
as gratified to hear you, Ann & the children as well as Mr s Taylor & 
Betty were all well when you last wrote, & heard from them, & most sin 
cerely do I hope this state of things will continue, alth I feel great anxiety 
on your own & their acct until there is a frost, which will put an end to 
the yellow fever, as I am apprehensive it may find its way to the crowded 
watering places on the Lakes & can hardly fail doing so, to the barracks, 
before the cold weather sets in. Betty writes me from East <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> on 
the 2 d ult that the place was crowded to overflowing, that many were 
compelled to sleep on the floors & in the galleries ; that Ann had arrived 
& found it impossible to get a room, & had to go to West <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a>, 
wher she & the girls were quite comfortable, & would join her mother as 
soon as they could give her a room, which she B. though would be very 
soon, when they would get together, which I trust is by this time if not 
before She also stated that Dick hadjoined them very much improved 
in health, & after remaining a few days, had gone on to the White Sulpher springs in Virginia, which he had been advised to do; which I rather 
regret his doing on acct of the lateness of the season, they generally have 
frost in that region early in Sept r at any rate by the 2o th when all visitors 
take their departure. I think if John gets on board a good vessel with 
a proper commander he will do well in taking the contemplated voyage, 
even if he is absent from the U. States for several years, as it will be in 
the way of his duty ; he has selected a profession which is a highly honor 
able one, but in its commencement attended with many privations & 
severe trials, which I sincerely hope he will cheerfully meet & overcome; 
a voyage such as is in contemplation I trow if he lives to pass through it, 
will be the most unpleasant one he will ever have to encounter; I hope 
let him be where he may, he will not lose sight of his studies, but will 
devote himself to his book every moment he can spare from his duties ; 
I hope he will be as ambitious to be a good scholar, as he will to be an 
able seaman. At any rate he has my constant wishes for his entire suc 
cess. 1 hope Bob went of his own will or consent to Mr Aliens school, in 
Kentucky & that he will remain there until he is prepared for college, or 
some other situation ; the changes of schools so frequently, generally ends 
in learning but little by those who do so 
</p><p>
We have just rec d a cross the country the gratifying intelligence alth 
not official, can be relied on, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> defeated one division of the 
Mexican army 5000 strong within a few miles of the capital, killing & 
capturing nearly the whole which had resulted in an armistice to afford an 
opportunity to enter into negotiations for peace which I sincerely hope 
will grow out of it & that it is brought to a close by this time if not 
before; if so it will enable some of us at least, myself among the number 
to return to the U. States; should negotiations be broken off as soon as I 
ascertain the fact, & hear that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> has taken possession of the City 
of Mexico, I will apply for permission to return to the United States & 
hope to be able to join my family by the first of Dec r or soon after 
Under all the circumstances in which you are placed, I think you have 
decided correctly to remain where you are for the present, & most truly 
do I hope you will escape the effects of any contageous disease, even 
should anything of the kind visit your station. The barracks I consider 
by no means a desirable station, but it will be vastly more so, than many 
which will have to be occupied by us in this quarter, Santa Fe, Callifornia & Oregon & on the route to that country. On the subject of resign 
ing it seems to me you ought not to think of doing so even if your lot is 
to remain where you are, unless you saw your way clear to do better; for 
D r Frankling say in one of his proverbs "he who has an office has an 
estate, & he who has a trade has a fortune, but the first must be attended 
to & the latter carried on." There is no doubt with your means & what 
I could do for Ann, you might in some of the Western states or Western 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> by managing the same judiciously live very comfortably but 
could be hardly satisfied to do nothing or next to nothing, for it is now 
too late in life to think of going into private practice; but I would resign 
rather than be stationed permanently on this frontier, in Callifornia, New 
Mexico or Oregon; it is unnecessary to take trouble on interest, as we 
have a plenty without 
</p><p>
On the subject of the presidency between ourselves I do not care a 
fig about the office, I would much rather remain in the army in command 
of the Southern division or will if necessary retire from public life, rather 
than go to Washington, so they the editors & others may publish my let 
ters & make as many comments on them as they please. I think my 
friend Gen Hunt a goo deal visionary, an excellent man, yet I would not 
commit myself with him ; let politicians determine on who they will elect for 
vice as well as president, & so they are honest & capable is all I care about 
</p><p>
As to Scotts & Worths falling out, unless to mask some dirty work, 
I do not believe a word of it ; you will see when understood what it all 
amount to 
</p><p>
You will see at the coming session of congress great efforts made or I 
am mistaken, to bring other individuals than my self before the country 
for the presidency, Gen S. one of them, but how far he will, or who will 
reach that office time must determine 
</p><p>
I hope Col Davis will enter into no pledges in order to go the Senate, 
or any where else, & am satisfied he will not if at all improper As to 
Gen Houston it is a matter of no moment what his opinion is of me, as 
they can be but of little importance be they what they may I apprehend no outbreak with England, be her cause of grievances what they 
may; she cannot do without our trade; alth our people might be ready 
to rush into war with her ; since our unprecedented success in Mexico ; 
but should we have to measure strength with John Bull, we will find some 
difference between him & the Mexicans 
</p><p>
Col Randall has not got here I have ordered an escort by this mail, 
to accompany him from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> to this place, & shall look for him in 
about ten days 
</p><p>
Wishing you & yours continued health & prosperity as well as my 
love to Ann when you write her & the girls, I remain truly 
</p><p>
Your Friend

P. S. I hope Jouett has made his escape ere this, & got some where 
out of reach of the fever Let me hear from you by every opportunity 
if only a half dozen lines as I shall be very uneasy until frost.
