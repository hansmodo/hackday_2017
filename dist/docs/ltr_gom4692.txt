Sir, 
</p><p>
Thomas Paine has just made application to me, to claim 
him as a citizen of the United States. The following, I believe, are the facts with regard to him. He was born in Eng 
land; becoming afterwards a citizen of the United. States, he 
gained great celebrity there, by his revolutionary writings. In consequence, he was adopted as a French citizen, and then 
chosen a member of the Convention. His conduct from that 
time has not come under my cognizance. I am ignorant of 
the cause of his present detention in the prisons of Luxembourg ; but I pray you, Sir, if any reasons with which I am 
unacquainted oppose his liberation, to have the goodness to 
inform me of them, that I may communicate them to the government of the United States. I have the honor to be, &c.
