DEAR SIR : About the 15th of April, I wrote you from "Washington, in answer to your letter of December, 
apologizing, at the same time, for the lapse of so great a period between the date of your letter and that 
of my reply. For God's sake, therefore, do n't retaliate on me in this particular. My movements for the summer, as far as can now be ascertained, will be to return to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to-morrow, to pass one month (something less) in that vicinity ; thence to <a href="/results.php?city=bedford" rel="city">Bedford</a>, in the mountains of Pennsylvania, where I may remain several weeks, taking excursions to <a href="/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a>, Union Town, etc. The mountain part of my project is for the health of my 
daughter, who has just come on from South Carolina, to pass the season with me. I would take her on to your 
house, if it were not for the extreme inconvenience of re-ascending, especially with the incumbrance of a three year-old child. With entire respect, 
</p><p>
Your friend and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>. 
</p><p>
Address me at "<a href="/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington City</a>. If the " city " be omitted, your letter may go to forty Washingtons with out meeting that which is intended. In case of a direct 
opportunity to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, you may address me there, to be left in the "Post-office" The former, however, is the safer mode. <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
