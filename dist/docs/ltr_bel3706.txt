My dear General, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you that <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a> sailed on the loth, after waiting several days 
in Nantasket Road for a fair wind. On his arrival here, he found the Alliance had not completed her 
crew, and that it would be difficult soon to effect it. 
This induced him to apply to the Navy Board to obtain from the General Court a power to impress, 
which not only failed in the House, but so alarmed 
the sailors, that some secreted themselves, and others 
left the town; so that, although the Assembly ordered the bounty increased out of their own chest, and 
afterwards gave a permission to enlist out of The State troops, a deficiency still existed, and the ship 
was detained solely by the want of a crew. This 
being represented by <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a>, and the importance of his mission, joined by his request that I 
would aid in completing the crew of the Alliance by 
suffering the sea-officers to engage such of the recruits 
of this State, as were qualified for the marine service, induced me to permit it and eight or ten of the recruits, and about the same number of invalids, went 
on board, which I hope will meet with your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
I have been frequently applied to for warrants for the pay of the invalids and others. Have I power 
to grant such warrants ? The late Lieutenant-Colonel Loring has been to Congress, I suppose, to solicit a 
new hearing. From the papers he showed me in September last, I thought that he had such new and 
material evidence to offer in his case, as gave flattering hopes that he would obtain his wishes, and prove 
himself an honest man. I know his circumstances to be such as forbid his remaining longer from his family, without great injury to himself and them. Give 
me leave to beg, my dear Sir, if he is to enjoy the benefit of a new hearing, that he may, as early as possible, have that favor. 
</p><p>
There are many deserters strolling through the 
country, who, I suppose, would return to their duty, 
if they could hope for a pardon. But past omissions 
to embrace the mercy so often held out to them, have, 
I presume, prevented your Excellency from repeating 
once more that which has been attended with so 
little success. Though I cannot solicit your Excellency in behalf of these infatuated men, without hurting 
your feelings (for I am confident your willingness to 
save has known no other hounds than the utmost 
limits of mercy to the wicked, which could he exercised short of cruelty to the good), yet I have my 
wishes that the most virtuous, if virtue can be applied to any of them, might he encouraged to hope 
for an opportunity of evidencing the sincerity of their 
repentance by future obedience, and rewarded accordingly. I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
with every sentiment of esteem. 
</p><p>
Yours, &c.,
