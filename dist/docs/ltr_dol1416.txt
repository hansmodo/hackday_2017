There has been a spell upon my fingers for a long time, dearest niece, and even 
now there rests one on my eyes ; still I would commune with you, whom I love so 
much, and tell you that your letters are all received, and my spirits rising as I peruse 
them, because my hopes are renewed for dear Walter in your amiable efforts to em 
bark him again on the waves of fortune. I rejoice at the pleasant visit you made to 
Kalorama with dear Dolche. I was anxious to write and tell you of our visit from 
Miss Martineau, and how much we enjoyed her enlightened conversation and unassuming manners. We also liked her 
lively little friend, Miss Jeffries. Ah me ! my eyes are even now so troublesome that 
I must hasten to say as much as I can in a short space of time, hoping to do more when they are better.

I have no idea of the new dance you speak of, or its motions, but approve of 
your declining to learn it, if disapproved of by society. Our sex are ever losers, 
when they stem the torrent of public opinion. Baron K. s parties must be piquant 
and agreeable, but if Sir Charles Vaughn leaves what will you all do ?

Your uncle is still about the same, but I hope as the season advances he will gain 
strength again. With much love to all the dear ones, Always your own aunt,
