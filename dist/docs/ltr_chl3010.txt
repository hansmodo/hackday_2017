DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
This instant came express, from Colonel Tupper, 
(stationed opposite to Dobbs's Ferry), one David Keech. The substance of his intelligence is as follows. That the enemy began their march at nine 
this morning, down the river, with their baggage, artillery, &c. ; that the man-of-war and two store-ships 
had just set sail, and were making down (I mean 
those which came up last); that three ships still lie off Tarry town and Sing Sing, two at the former, and 
one at the latter. Keech says the whole army have 
quitted Dobbs's Ferry, and imagines the rear have 
by this time reached King's Bridge. 
</p><p>
I am far from being satisfied with the conduct of 
our scouts. I do not think they venture far enough, 
for they generally bring back very lame, imperfect 
accounts. But I have projected a plan for breaking 
in, at least, upon Rogers's party, and believe I shall 
succeed. The sentence on Austin is, that he should 
be reprimanded; but I have ordered a new court-martial, with a charge of wanton, barbarous conduct, 
unbecoming, not only an officer, but a human creature.

<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a></a> and the Massachusetts Committee 
are using their efforts to detain the militia; whether 
they will succeed, heaven only knows. Hitchcock 
and Yarnum do not recollect the recommendation of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a></a>, but I have ordered them to give me 
a list of those who they think ought to be recommended ; for it is now too late to refer to Greene, 
as the Commissioners are expected every hour. I 
wish to God you were here, as I am in a manner a 
stranger to their respective merits. When the list is 
made out, I shall inform myself, as well as I can, if 
their recommendation is impartial, and proceed accordingly. I am, dear General, 
</p><p>
Yours, most sincerely,
