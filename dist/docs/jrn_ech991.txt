On Saturday about noon the British mail steamer from Panama, carrying the mail from that place, arrived. We all anticipated receiving papers and letters from home, but in this we have been disappointed. Not one of our passengers has received a newspaper or letter, although they were doubtless written and started on their way, but owing to our miserable mail arrangement with the Chilian Government, they were forwarded only as far as Panama and there they remain as dead, because no one is there to pay the postage from that place. In fact the Chilian and U. S. Governments have no postal arrangements
between them and everything has to be forwarded by the British mail or sent privately round the Horn. The only papers we have seen we have begged from residents here. The latest dates we have from the States are to the middle of August, brought by vessels that sailed after that date via the Horn. We have a report that France has declared war against the United States, but place no reliance in the rumor. What little intelligence we have been able to learn has been highly gratifying to all Californians, and consequently all are in high glee at the golden prospects before them.

From conversation that I have had with many who came via the Horn, I learn that they have had as hard a time of it as ourselves, but others again have doubled the dreaded point without experiencing an hour's bad weather.

Yesterday, Sunday, I spent on shore, for the purpose of witnessing the modus operandi in this place. The stores, shops and hotels were open during the day and seemed to enjoy as good a patronage, if not better than on other days. Men were at work with their jackasses toting water from the mountains, and all kinds of business went on as usual. In the morning the churches were open and in the evening I attended the theatre. A comedy was tolerably played and a young señorita danced very prettily and the music was very good, but the audience was rather slim, but few of the bon ton being present. I stayed until the performance closed about twelve o'clock, and then searched the city until two o'clock before finding a roof to sleep under. I finally slept in a garret, on a cot with a blanket over me, paying fifty cents for this privilege. I have not been very well, owing to a sudden change from salt to fresh provisions.
