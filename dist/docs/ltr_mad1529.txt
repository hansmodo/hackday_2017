DEAR SIR, I received your favor of the 29th ultimo on Thursday. That by Col. Lee had been previously delivered. Your 
letter for the Assembly was laid before them yesterday. I have 
reason to believe that it was received with every sentiment 
which could correspond with yours. Nothing passed from which 
any conjecture could be formed as to the objects which would 
be most pleasing for the appropriation of the fund. The disposition is, I am persuaded, much stronger to acquiesce in your 
choice, whatever it may be, than to lead or anticipate it. I see 
no inconveniency in your taking time for a choice that will 
please yourself. The letter was referred to a committee, which 
will no doubt make such a report as will give effect to your 
wishes.

Our Session commenced very inauspiciously with a contest 
for the chair, whicli was followed by a rigid scrutiny into Mr. 
Harrison's election in his County. He gained the chair by a 
majority of six votes, and retained his seat by a majority of still 
fewer. His residence was the point on which the latter question turned. Doctor Lee's election was questioned on a similar point, and was also established; but it was held to be vacated by his acceptance of a lucrative post under the United 
States. The House have engaged with some alacrity in the 
consideration of the Revised Code, prepared by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>, 
Mr. Pendleton, and Mr. Wythe. The present temper promises 
an adoption of it in substance. The greatest danger arises 
from its length, compared with the patience of the members. If 
it is persisted in, it must exclude several matters which are of 
moment, but, I hope, only for the present Assembly. The pulse 
of the House of Delegates was felt on Thursday with regard to 
a general manumission, by a petition presented on that subject. 
It was rejected without dissent, but not without an avowed 
patronage of its principle by sundry respectable members. A 
motion was made to throw it under the table, which was treated 
with as much indignation on one side as the petition itself was 
on the other. There are several petitions before the House 
against any step towards freeing the Slaves, and even praying 
for a repeal of the law which licences particular manumissions.

The merchants of several of our towns have made representations on the distress of our commerce, which have raised the 
question whether relief shall be attempted by a reference to 
Congress, or by measures within our own compass. On a pretty 
full discussion, it was determined by a large majority that the 
power over trade ought to be vested in Congress, under certain 
qualifications. If the qualifications suggested, and no others, 
should be annexed, I think they will not be subversive of the 
principle; tho' they will, no doubt, lessen its utility. The 
Speaker, Mr. M. Smith, and Mr. Braxton, are the champions 
against Congress. Mr. Thruston and Mr. White have since 
come in, and I fancy I may set down both as auxiliaries. 
</p><p>
They are not a little puzzled, however, by the difficulty of 
substituting any practicable regulations within ourselves. Mr. 
Braxton proposed two, that did not much aid his side of the 
question. The first was, that all British vessels from the West 
Indies should be excluded from our ports; the second, that no 
merchant should carry on trade here until he should have been 
a resident years. Unless some plan free from objection 
can be devised for this State, its patrons will be reduced clearly 
to the dilemma of acceding to a general one, or leaving our 
trade under all its present embarrassments. There was some 
little skirmishing on the ground of public faith, which leads me 
to hope that its friends have less to fear than was surmised. 
The Assize and Port Bills have not yet been awakened. The 
Senate will make a House to-day for the first time. 
Inclosed herewith are two Reports from the commissioners 
for examining the head of James River, &c., and the ground 
between the waters of Elizabeth River and North Carolina; 
also, a sensible pamphlet said to be written by St. George Tucker.
