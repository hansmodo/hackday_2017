This morning the wind fell again and we were almost becalmed all day. Towards evening, however, the wind sprung up from the northeast and now we are making handsome time on our course. We are very impatient to reach the promised haven and our joy is regulated entirely by the changes of the wind.

For several days past, our vessel has been followed by large black birds, and a hook and line was put out for them and one or two caught, killed and thrown away. We have had a great deal of sport or amusement in catching birds and tying a large bait of pork to them and then letting them go and seeing the others chase them. This afternoon we witnessed a case of brutish cruelty by one of the Frenchmen on one of the large birds that was caught with the hook and line. He landed the bird on deck and then cut off both its legs and in this state threw it overboard into the water. His partner, who was also catching birds, soon after had his line cut while in his hands, by some "unknown person or persons!" This was not a very nice trick for it was not him that hurt the birdand he became
middling angry. A large number of porpoises are to be seen in our vicinity, and an immense school of large grampuses was quite near, lazily floating on the surface.

Some difficulty arising between the carpenter and Mr. Field, they took a "set to," clinched, and fell. The former, being on top, arose and stamped his opponent in the face. Neither was much hurt

As we approach the place of our destination the boys are busying themselves in making various bags, shot pouches, etc., out of old boot legs. This afternoon I finished one myself. Trade is becoming very brisk. Soon after breakfast the boys were seized with a great mania for it, and many articles exchanged owners. In less than half an hour I traded coats three times. Also I sold two pairs of boots and bought one.

This forenoon some of the boys had a merry time over the flowing bowl, and this evening the sailors have taken their turn and some of them have become so wild that they are hardly fit for duty. Almost every evening the table is filled by parties engaged in the pleasant and exciting recreation of cards. This evening the boys got out the fiddle and had a merry dance. They danced several "cow-tillions" and then introduced a new dance under the name of "California War Dance." In performing the latter, six persons form a ring and place their leader in the center. When the music strikes up they commence dancing around in a circle, and make the welkin ring by their shouting and bellowing.
