SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency undoubtedly has frequently had 
under consideration a proper position for winter-quarters. It is not always in the power of a General to 
take a position most favorable to his wishes, on ac 
count of provision and forage, or to place himself in 
the most advantageous point of view for covering the 
country and securing his capital posts. A certainty 
with respect to provision and forage is an object of 
the first consideration in taking a position. All inferior evils, of whatever nature, may, in some sort, be 
remedied by foresight and precaution; but there is 
no contending with hunger. Therefore, what would 
be considered only as secondary objects in some cases, 
become principals here. 
</p><p>
In the choice of a position, we must pay some regard to the enemy's collected force, and to our divided condition, in which the army must of necessity 
be cantoned. The enemy now appear to be putting 
their troops into winter-quarters ; but it cannot be 
supposed they will remain inactive all winter, if we, 
by the manner of cantoning the army, open to them 
an opportunity of insulting us to advantage. The 
mischievous consequences of having our quarters beat 
up, in the dead of winter, cannot readily be foreseen. 
That it would be their duty and interest to lay hold 
of such an opportunity, nobody can deny; and that 
the character of the General, and many national circumstances, lead to the supposition, must be agreed 
to. It is necessary, therefore, to take a position which will secure us from a surprise, and have as much 
force together as possible, to free us from insult. The 
place where, and the force necessary, to these ends, 
are the two capital points to decide upon. 
</p><p>
The command of the North River is an object of 
such importance, that the force and supplies necessary for this purpose must be had at all events. The 
force requisite for these garrisons, I suppose, has been 
very judiciously calculated by General Duportail; and 
I imagine there cannot be any great variation from 
his report. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will find, after detaching a proper 
force for this place, a covering party for the State 
of Connecticut, and the other necessary guards for 
King's Ferry, stores, and posts of communication, 
your force will be greatly inferior to that of the enemy ; and it will be growing more and more so as 
the service of the soldiers expires. It will be necessary, therefore, to endeavour to remedy, by the strength 
of ground, the deficiency of force. 
</p><p>
I have no doubt but that every State bordering 
upon the enemy, will apply for a proper force, to protect them against their ravages. To comply with 
these demands, will hard the safety of the whole 
army. Divide your force,, and you will fall a prey 
in every quarter; and, I am persuaded, were you to 
adopt the plan which would be most flattering to the 
wishes of the people, it would be so far from affording them that protection and security which they 
promise themselves, that it would become one of the 
principal causes of the enemy's making inroads, and 
committing depredations upon them. 
</p><p>
There can be but two modes of cantonment, to 
prevent the enemy from disturbing us in quarters. 
One is, to keep such a force together as to bid defiance to all their menaces ; the other is, to disperse 
the troops in such a manner as to afford no object. 
The first is infinitely the most favorable to discipline and economy. To disperse the troops among the 
inhabitants, will be attended with a certain loss of 
discipline to the soldiers and a general corruption of 
manners among the people. They will mutually debauch each other. Besides these disadvantages, the 
expense and waste of stores will be nearly double, 
and a great addition to the list of Staff Officers (al 
ready too numerous from the state of our money) 
will be found necessary. For these, and many other 
reasons too obvious to need explanation, dispersing 
the troops should be avoided at all events. 
</p><p>
Whatever covering is given to any part of the 
country, except where the principal force is stationed, 
should be so calculated as to be able to check the 
enemy's small ravaging parties, and yet not be an 
object worthy any considerable movement of theirs. 
</p><p>
From the representation of both the Commissary-General and the Foragemaster-General, I find your Excellency will be obliged to quarter the troops in 
New Jersey. The great consumption of forage, that 
has taken place in this State for five months past, 
will render it very difficult to provide for this garrison, and the different posts of communication. 
</p><p>
In cantoning the troops and drawing supplies for 
their subsistence, it may not be amiss to have an eye 
to the affair of next campaign. The expense and difficulty of transportation from the Western States, your Excellency is perfectly acquainted with. You are 
also sensible that the long tract of barren country, 
through which the supplies must come, will only admit of a certain quantity of transportation; therefore 
I conceive, that good policy points out the necessity 
of keeping as many stores in reserve in this State 
as possible. This is necessary, not only to be prepared for any emergency that may happen from the 
enemy's turning their force against the Eastern States, 
but to have a magazine in readiness for a secret 
purpose, which your Excellency hinted to me a few 
days since. 
</p><p>
The further we move our main force to the westward, and still be within supporting distance of this garrison, the better, both for the preservation of the 
provision and forage of this State, as well as to les 
sen the general expense of transportation. And the 
greater stock of provision and forage we can leave 
in this State, and upon the communications, the less 
difficulty we shall find in giving support to this 
place, should the enemy approach it. I should re 
commend, therefore, to quarter the army as far wesir 
ward as <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=baskingridge' rel='city'>Baskingridge</a>. The country is 
strong, secure from a surprise, happily situated to receive supplies of provisions and forage, and not very 
inconvenient for giving protection and cover to the 
inhabitants. It is true, it is considerably removed 
from this place. But were we to take a position at 
Suffern's or <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a>, the consumption of forage would 
be so great that it would destroy the possibility of 
keeping up a communication with the Western States, 
however pressing the necessity, before the grass sea 
son. Suppose the enemy should move up, early in 
the spring, and lay siege to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, and the 
supplies of this State prove unequal to our support, 
should we not be obliged to abandon it to its fate ? 
</p><p>
There is another objection to the Suffern's or <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> position, which is, the advantage it gives the 
enemy of dividing our attention, by taking post at 
King's Ferry. It will be impossible for us to deter 
mine which is their object, the camp or <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>; 
and it will be almost as dangerous to expose our camp as these garrisons, especially early in the 
spring, when we have all our baggage about us, and 
no possibility of moving it off. If we take a position 
near Morris, we can always tell, by the motions of the 
enemy, what is their object; and, having our camp 
in a secure situation, should they turn their force to 
wards this place, we can march to its relief in such 
force as to give certain support, and at the same 
time leave our camp in perfect security. 
</p><p>
The fortifications here are so strong, and the garrison will be so numerous, that I think we have but 
little to fear, either from a surprise or storm ; and therefore we have only to guard against an investiture or siege. 
</p><p>
As the enemy have the advantage of a water transportation, and the spring is the most difficult part of 
the year for a land conveyance, it is most probable, 
if they have any designs upon this post, they will 
commence their operations before the grass season. 
Will it not be worth while, therefore, to form a small 
magazine of provision and forage, at or near Mr. Erskine's Iron Works, for the purpose of subsisting the 
army on their march to this place ? And another 
considerable magazine of provision and forage at 
Chester or Warwick for the support of this army in 
whatever position it may take for the relief of this garrison? These magazines should be formed from 
the westward, in the winter season, when there is 
the least call for transportation, and the roads the 
most favorable for the purpose. 
</p><p>
I imagine there will be great interest made for 
the eastern troops to be posted on the east side of 
the North River, to favor their recruiting. These 
reasons have something plausible in them, but I have 
my doubts with respect to their truth and reality. 
Men, when they are near home, are much more influenced by domestic attachments than they are when 
they are at a great distance. The friends and relations of the soldiers very seldom use their influence 
to engage them in the service. On the contrary, 
they commonly make use of every argument to dissuade them from it. I am of opinion, therefore, the 
further the troops are removed from home, the more 
favorable it will be to the recruiting service in camp. 
</p><p>
There is but one reason for cantoning the eastern 
troops on the east side of the North River; and that 
is, they are more convenient to receive their State 
stores. But this is so trifling a consideration, that it 
ought to have no weight, when it is opposed to so 
many more important considerations. 
</p><p>
My present opinion favors the following disposition 
of the troops for winter-quarters. The garrison here 
should consist of Patterson's, Learned's, Clinton's, and 
the North Carolina brigades, which, I believe, will forma force sufficient for the purpose. If the horse is 
posted in Connecticut, as seems to be thought on, I 
think the troops coming from Rhode Island, in con 
junction with the horse, will form a sufficient covering party for the exposed parts of Connecticut and 
Westchester. I would only wish Clinton's brigade to 
be here, because it may interest the inhabitants to 
furnish supplies in the winter, and to encourage the 
militia to turn out with spirit, should the enemy make a sudden move towards the post. The connection between the army and country will have an influence 
in both these respects. 
</p><p>
The Delaware regiment can furnish guards for 
King's Ferry, and the stores at Ilingwood, should 
your Excellency think proper to establish a magazine there. I mention this regiment for this service, be 
cause it seems to be unconnected with any brigades ; 
or, at least, the Maryland brigades are complete with 
out it. 
</p><p>
The rest of the troops I would quarter, as before mentioned, somewhere not far distant from Morris or 
<a href='/results.php?city=baskingridge' rel='city origin'>Baskingridge</a>, according as wood and water may favor a position. 
</p><p>
Should the enemy make any considerable detachments from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, a larger covering party may 
be necessary for the State of Connecticut, as I should 
have more apprehensions of their committing depredations, if they detach, than if they do not; for then 
they will have nothing left but to play the small game. 
</p><p>
The earlier the position is fixed upon, the better 
for quartering the army. I wish your Excellency,therefore, as soon as you have decided in your mind 
the places and force requisite for each side of the 
North River, and the garrison for these fortifications, 
would please to acquaint me therewith, as it will 
be a more perfect guide to my conduct, in making 
the preparations for cantoning the army. I am, with 
great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
