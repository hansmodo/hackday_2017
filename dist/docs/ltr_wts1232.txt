Dear Brother : . . . I shall go to California to be in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san francisco" rel="city">San Francisco</a> August 3d-5th for the Encampment of the 
G. A. B,., when, of course, I shall be forced to say something. It occurs to me that I should say something 
about the annexation of California to the Union. I 
know that Webster advised a friend of his as early as 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1843">1843</a>-44 to go to California, because it surely would on 
the first pretext be captured and held by the United 
States. 
</p><p>
I have all the executive documents for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>, also the 
special Mexican War correspondence, but I fail to find 
Corwin's speech where he used the expression that were 
he a Mexican he would welcome the enemy (the Americans) "with bloody hands to hospitable graves." Can 
you get this speech for me, or an extract? I know that 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> believed that Texas did not reach the 
Rio Grande but was bordered by the River Nueces, and 
that the proclamation of war was based on an error that 
"American blood had been shed on American soil," and 
now comes Grant, who expresses more than a doubt if 
the first blood shed Palo Alto was not on " Mexican 
soil." Notwithstanding this, I believe the annexation of 
California was essential to the world's progress at that 
date. The Mexicans had held it for a hundred years 
without material improvement, whereas under our 
domination it at once began that wonderful development 
which we now experience. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
