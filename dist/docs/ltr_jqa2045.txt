</p><p>
SIR: 
</p><p>
I received last evening from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> the papers which 
I now take the liberty to inclose, together with a letter from 
Mr. Boylston, the gentleman who chartered the vessel 
in question, and with whom I have had a long and valuable acquaintance. 
</p><p>
His letter states to me, and with obvious truth, that an 
early as well as a favorable decision upon this case is of 
vast importance to the interests of the United States ; that 
in consequence of this capture an immediate rise of an 
hundred per centum of the premium upon insurance of all 
American ships took place, although it was already before 
that time double the ordinary peace premium. There are 
many other considerations which render any obstruction to 
the facility of our returning commerce from Great Britain 
at this time peculiarly injurious to us, and which you will 
certainly be able to appreciate at their proper value. 
</p><p>
Mr. Boylston estimates at nearly 700,000 sterling the annual burthen of extraordinary insurance to which our 
commerce is subjected by this rise of premium. His calculation I think is not much too high, and it becomes an 
object of the greater moment to the interest of our country, 
as so large a proportion of our insurance is made in England ; 
so that in its effects the principle of this capture operates 
for the present to the detriment of the United States, for 
the benefit of Great Britain. 
</p><p>
I am well assured, Sir, that your zeal for the interests 
of the United States in general, and for the security and 
efficacy of their rights to all your fellow citizens individually, 
is too ardent and active to be susceptible of any accession 
from my solicitations. It would therefore be unnecessary, 
though I hope it will not be improper for me to add, that in 
the particular instance upon which I now address you my 
feelings of private friendship coincide with my concern for 
the public welfare. That the gentlemen to whom the property was addressed and belonged are all personally known 
to me. That Mr. Gill is Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, and Messrs. Head and Amory are among the most 
respectable citizens of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and that in recommending 
the case to your attention I follow the impulse of my inclination no less than the dictate of my duty. 
</p><p>
I am happy, Sir, that this opportunity is given me to 
return you my best acknowledgments for your kind offer 
of a good understanding and correspondence between us, of 
which my father informed me at the time when I had the 
honor of being appointed to my present station. I should 
have notified you of my arrival here before this but for the 
interruption of the communication between France and this 
country, consequent upon the present state of affairs. 
When the regular intercourse shall again be restored I shall 
feel myself honored by a correspondence as frequent and considerable as may consist with propriety and the public service. I am, etc.
