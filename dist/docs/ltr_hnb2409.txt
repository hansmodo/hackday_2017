SIR : Perceiving you seem disposed to assign to me your interest in the contract you entered into with Wilkins and Morrison, in 180G, provided "I can enlighten 
you as to the nature of the action I would bring against them," I hasten to acquaint you that I should prefer 
suing them directly, in the character of your assignees, for the amount of the advance you made to them, in bills 
rendered negotiable by my indorsement, to the contingent recovery I might obtain against them as garnishees in a suit already instituted at New Orleans. 
</p><p>
Copies of the contract, and of the receipt of "Wilkins and Morrison for $15,000, in bills, shall be forwarded to 
you, and if you think proper, without delay, to transmit me a properly authenticated assignment of all your 
claims for the above advance, and for damages on account of the non-fulfillment of the contract, I will order the 
present suit commenced against you at New Orleans to be dismissed. As your letter of the 8th ult. appears to 
have been dictated by a spirit of accommodation, permit me now, sir, to test its character by suggesting that I 
have no view " to reaction " upon you in whatever operations I may essay to obtain some indemnity for my losses. 
These, <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Governor Alston</a> may have stated to you, I estimate at $50,000, of which his Excellency has already 
reimbursed, I believe, $12,500, and it is very probable nothing short of the publication of my book, hitherto 
postponed only by sickness, will bring me any part of the balance so long sought in vain from his honor and 
engagements. His well-earned election to the chief executive office of his State, and your return from Europe, 
will, however, now render the publication more effective than it would have been prior to these events, and it will 
be expedited within three months from this date, if all other means of indemnity fail within that period. I 
would still agree to accept from any other source $15,000, in lieu of the balance I claim of $37,500, and, of course, withhold the book, which is entitled, " A Review of the 
Projects and Intrigues of <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Aaron Burr</a>, during the years 
<a href="/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>-6-7, including therein, as parties or privies, <a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="">Thos. Jefferson</a>, Albert Gallatin, Dr. Eustis, <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Governor Alston</a>, Dan. Clark, Generals Wilkinson, Dearborn, Harrison, Jackson and Smith, and the late Spanish Ambassador, , 
exhibiting original documents and correspondence hitherto unpublished, compiled from the notes and private Journal, kept during the above period ; by <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">H. BLENNERHASSETT</a>, LL. B ; " with this motto, which will find applicability in every page of the book : " It is only the Philosopher who knows how to mark the boundary between celebrity and greatness." 
</p><p>
You will now, sir, I hope, perceive distinctly upon what terms I would execute a general acquittance to 
<a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Governor Alston</a> and yourself. I have long since abandoned every chance of reimbursement from either of you, unless I should succeed in forcing the object through the 
alarms of his Excellency, or the fears and interest of other characters. I have only to add, respecting those of Wilkins and Morrison, who have pocketed the money with out a consideration, that as an action would not lie by me against them, the credit having moved from you to 
them, after it had passed from me to you, it is therefore I have applied for the assignment desired, which would 
enable me to sue them directly, which I should prefer to continuing the suit now pending against yourself. Be pleased, sir, to inform me whether Gen. Jackson is or is 
not indebted to you in a balance of $l,726 T Vu, as is stated on the face of an open account in his own hand-writing. 
While he was here with his militia, I had him summoned as a garnishee to the Circuit Court of Adams county, 
where having made default, if he does not personally appear at the next October term, I understand judgment 
will go against him for $5,000, that being the sum sworn to in the affidavit on which the attachment was issued. 
From, sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
