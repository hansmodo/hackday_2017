HONORED MADAM: 
</p><p>
This is the second or third time that I have wrote you without hearing a word from you or of you, only in general that you are very well. 
The last was on the 20th, by your servant, Moses, which I hope you 
have received. Since that <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> has thought proper to re 
move the army from Purysburgh to the two Sisters (except about three hundred left as a guard to their camp under the command of Col. Pinckney) where it seems the enemy have assembled their whole force, 
and from whence an easy transition may be made into this State this 
movement is if possible to prevent their crossing, and keep them at bay 
until our army is reinforced, either by the arrival of some auxiliaries 
from the northward, or by a body of our militia from Orangeburgh. I 
am led to believe the Governor's presence will have a good effect in 
inducing the militia to turn out more cheerfully than they have hitherto 
done. We must now or never turn our thoughts entirely to war; we 
must rouse our spirits and sacrifice with pleasure part of our estates to 
secure the rest; in short we must be wanting to ourselves in nothing 
that may be requisite to the common safety have we any reason or the 
least pretence to be excused from so doing ? In what fatal tranquility 
did we remain when we received the intelligence of the enemy's being 
in possession of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, the defeat at <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, the taking of our 
gallies, and other affairs of less importance. We are now sufficiently 
punished by the consequences of our insensibility ; for had we sent 
speedy relief to <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> when besieged, which the common rules of 
policy and prudence required the enemy would not perhaps have been 
in possession of it at this day; but by perpetually neglecting the present and vainly hoping, that time would adjust matters and bring them 
to a better issue ; we have established them in a situation, that they 
never could have hoped to have arrived at. And yet we need not 
despair if we have still courage and perseverence enough to make use of 
the present opportunity, and by properly reinforcing our General, enable 
him effectually to prevent their crossing. We must all be sensible of 
the particular protection of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, in blessings so often offered ; 
and if we make a just estimate of its repeated favors, who is there but 
must be touched with the highest gratitude, for our losses are only to be 
imputed to the little concern we have shown to prevent them ; while a superior power never ceasing to protect us, does yet point out a short and 
secure way of repairing all our former mistakes, by every man's resolving to do his duty, thereby providing for the safety of his country, and 
doing all in his power to retrieve her reputation. Those who neglect or 
do not improve the favorable opportunities offered by <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, forget 
the acknowledgments that are due to her, and the same imprudence 
which makes them unfortunate, makes them ungrateful ; for in the 
minds of men, the last accident commonly impresses the character of misfortune or happiness upon the whole. It is time for us to reform our 
false mode of reasoning and to be truly ashamed of our want of public 
virtue. We should preserve at least what remains to prevent an eternal 
stain upon our reputation. Nor is our interest less at stake. For 
Georgia being now in their possession, what barrier have we to secure 
us from the conquerors ? I could mention a number of little skirmishes, 
that we have lately been unsuccessful in, but as the recital is disagree 
able, I will pass them over. We must surely be convinced by this 
time that we have been exceedingly remiss in suffering these encroachments upon our neighbours ; that we have a restless and enterprising 
enemy to deal with, that all their present designs are levelled against 
this town, and that all opposition to them, tends in some degree to the 
safety of the State for can any one be so weak as to imagine that they 
would undergo all the fatigues and hazards of a winter campaign merely 
to possess a few paltry posts on <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> river, and rather not with an 
eye to this place ? Will they suffer us (if they can prevent it) to enjoy 
the advantages this town affords, and take up their quarters in a swamp ? 
No ! they endure the one that they may possess the other. We should 
in time reflect, what must be the last fatal scene of the bloody tragedy, 
if while they act the parts of indefatigable conquerors, we remain the 
patient and gentle spectators of their unbounded violence. Can any be 
so weak-sighted as not to see that the war is hastening to us ? It must 
be blindness in them, who will not perceive that the calamities, the 
Georgians now endure, are the same that are preparing for themselves 
I fear we shall sometime or other pay very dear for those soft and easy 
moments we now enjoy through the fatal remissness of our present 
disposition. You will perhaps say, how easy it is to find fault that 
censuring is every body's talent ; but that few do their duty, and that 
those who censure most do the least they who deliver this opinion are 
commonly right ] however, I shall endeavor as long as I am able to do 
ray duty, and hope that in a little time the major part of my country 
men will do the same. My compliments to my cousin, conclude me 
Your affectionate nephew,
