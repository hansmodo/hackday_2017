SIR: 
</p><p>
I observe in your orders to Col. Saunders, he is directed to draft the 
Whole of his regiment. I omitted to inform you that I had directed no 
draws should be made from the John's Island, Wadmelaw, Edisto and 
Stono companies these companies being absolutely necessary to be 
kept at certain points to prevent the commerce between the country 
and Charlestown. I have, therefore, directed Col. Saunders to adhere 
to my former orders respecting these companies, and that I would inform 
you of the same. I suppose Col. Saunders has reported to you the 
refractory spirit that still prevails in his regiment. Unless vigorous 
measures are pursued to bring them to order, I am convinced they will 
do no duty. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
