MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE go on as usual, Congress resolving one thing and 
the democratical societies resolving the contrary ; the 
President doing what is right, and clubs and mobs re 
solving it to be all wrong. 
</p><p>
We had in Senate, a few days ago, the greatest 
curiosity of all. The senators from Virginia moved, 
in consequence of an instruction from their constituents, that the execution of the fourth article of the 
treaty of peace, relative to bona Jide debts, should 
be suspended, until Britain should fulfil the seventh 
article. When the question was put, fourteen voted 
against it, two only, the Virginia delegates, for it, and 
all the rest, but one, ran out of the room to avoid 
voting at all, and that one excused himself. This is 
the first instance of the kind. 
</p><p>
The motion disclosed the real object of all the wild 
projects and mad motions which have been made during the whole session. O ! liberty. O ! my coun 
try. O ! debt, and O ! sin ? These debtors are the 
persons who are continually declaiming against the 
corruption of Congress. Impudence ! thy front is 
brass. 
</p><p>
The House is upon ways and means, which will 
take us the rest of the month, I fear. 
</p><p>
Yours, as ever, <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>J. A.</a>
