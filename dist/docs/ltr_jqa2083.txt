DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
From the present situation of the nations of Europe, and 
from reflections to which my own experience as well as that 
of others has given occasion, it has occurred to me, that 
some advantage would be derived from the establishment 
of some general rules and principles by the government of 
the United States, to serve as directions to their agents, 
with respect to the delivery of passports, or any other papers, 
tending to procure in behalf of the persons to whom they were 
given, the enjoyment of advantages attending the character of an American citizen. 
</p><p>
In many parts of Europe at this time a passport is a paper 
of indispensable necessity to every traveller, and indeed to 
every individual in a country other than his own. Among 
the Americans, who are at this time in great numbers in 
different parts of Europe, some few have taken the precaution to provide themselves with passports from the Department of State ; but the far greater number come from home 
without any, and of course apply for them to the Ministers 
or other agents of the United States, in the countries where 
they respectively are, when they find the need of such a 
paper. It happens not unfrequently under these circumstances, that a real citizen of the United States and fully 
entitled to their protection, appears to demand a passport, 
without having any such proof of his citizenship, as the rigor 
of all judicial tribunals would require as evidence of facts. 
At the same time there are great numbers of impostors who 
oftenendeavor fraudulently to obtain passports as Americans. 
The inattention, which is common with those of the first 
class, facilitates the success of the others, and where the delivery of passports is left entirely to the discretion of every 
individual agent, there must be danger that the protection of the United States will be extended where it is not due, or denied where it is. 
</p><p>
The special evidence of citizenship required by some of the consuls, is a certificate from the proper office in any one 
of the United States. This is a species of evidence so customary and apparently so substantial, that in the present 
state of things it cannot reasonably be rejected as incompetent to authorize the demand of a passport. But in truth 
it is a species of evidence often possessed by persons who have very little claim to the protection of the United States, be 
sides its being liable to pass into hands that have no right to it at all. 
</p><p>
There is many an European who, having resided a year or 
two in some one of the United States, and having been 
naturalized for his personal convenience, has returned to 
Europe with his certificate in his pocket, which he now 
employs to claim all the privileges of the American name. 
In conformity to the universal practise, I have thought myself not at liberty to refuse passports to naturalized 
citizens ; but it has appeared to me that when an adopted member of any political association ceases to bear any 
portion of its burthens, he cannot in reason and justice claim its correlative protection. The late naturalization law will, however, reform the tendency to such abuses in future. 
</p><p>
The flag of the United States is liable to the same misuse 
with the character of citizen, and owing to the same reasons. 
The advantages of a neutral flag, insulted and abused as it 
has been, and still is, are however so great that every expedient has been used to procure it for many vessels that have 
never been out of the European seas. The consuls have 
been applied to for papers to serve as substitutes to those 
which belong to vessels of the United States, and some of 
them have accordingly delivered papers more or less irregular. It has been observed to me repeatedly by Europeans, 
that the American flag is often worn by vessels having no 
right to it, and it has been a subject of complaint from several 
Americans, whose fair trade is injured by this unauthorized 
participation. In one of the instances mentioned in my 
last letter, the captain of an English built vessel assumed the 
flag of the United States without any papers whatever, and 
upon the sole ground that he was himself an American 
citizen. It is not supposed that the mere personal title 
of the captain can authorize the employment of the Ameri 
can colors. Whether any papers that can be delivered by a 
consul have more efficacy to communicate the right, is at 
least questionable ; but if consular papers are understood 
to have a validity for this effect, it would perhaps be useful that their discretion should be guided in the delivery of them by the instructions of the government. 
</p><p>
Such instructions may possibly be especially necessary 
to those consuls of the United States who are themselves 
foreigners, and from their particular situations and interests, 
may be more susceptible of giving an extension rather too 
liberal to the participation of privileges that belong properly to Americans or citizens of a neutral nation. 
</p><p>
The consuls with whom I have been in regular correspondence make repeated complaints of the footing of the consular establishment at present. They are of opinion that the powers and emoluments annexed to the office are equally 
incompetent. The representations of Mr. Delius l have heretofore been transmitted to your department, and I 
understand from Mr. Bourne that he has more than once written to you upon the subject himself. 
</p><p>
The relative situation of the United States towards the 
nations of Europe since the commencement of the present 
maritime war is new, and its state of neutrality naturally 
occasions a variety of combinations, which may deserve 
the attention of the government in a greater degree than 
their intrinsic importance could claim. The misuse of the 
flag, the juggling of a passport, or even the occasional irregular employment of official means for the furtherance of 
foreign commercial speculations, may be in every single 
instance of minor importance; but when the examples are 
frequently repeated, when they may be attended with 
consequences involving more or less the national interest, 
and when they result from a state of things which, although 
temporary, will perhaps be frequently renewed, it is viewed 
as an obligation of duty to those within whose observation such facts are placed to give notice of them. 
</p><p>
With respect to passports, it might be of public utility that the American agents be instructed to deliver them in such 
cases as the government may think proper to prescribe, and upon the previous production of some special evidence 
in support of the demand. But in order to avoid an unfavorable operation of any such regulation upon many real 
American citizens, they must be in general aware of the 
importance to their own interest, that they should always 
take passports, or at least the evidence upon which they 
may be entitled to demand them, before they sail from the 
United States. Upon the subject of the flag, some sort of 
directions particular to those consuls or agents who are not 
citizens of the United States, may prevent the repetition of 
abuses which have taken place. 
</p><p>
I have the honor, &c.
