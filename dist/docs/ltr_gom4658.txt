Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just learned that the National Convention, in its session of the ninth, has authorised French ships of war and privateers to stop, and bring into the ports of the Republic, neutral 
vessels which shall be found loaded, wholly or in part, either 
with eatables belonging to a neutral power, shipped for enemies 
ports, or with merchandize belonging to enemies, which merchandize is declared good prize. 
</p><p>
I am ignorant, Sir, of the reasons which might explain the 
motives that led to the making of this decree, but I think I 
foresee, that the regulations just adopted by the Convention respecting eatables, will be eagerly followed by its maritime ene 
mies, and that in future the speculations of neutral commerce 
will, in fact, depend on the naval superiority of the belligerent 
powers. 
As to the dispositions of the decree, with respect to enemies 
merchandize shipped on board neutral vessels, I might go in 
to minute observations on the subject, if this point were to be 
decided upon by a treaty now to be made; but this being al 
ready definitely determined by the treaty of commerce, between France and the United States of America, I will only 
observe, Sir, that by the general terms in which the decree is 
expressed, its provisions might be extended to American vessels, which certainly could not enter into the views of the 
Convention. 
</p><p>
It seems to me then of immediate importance, that a decree 
should be made supplementary to that of the ninth, limiting the 
application of it, in accordance with justice and the good faith 
of the French nation. I have the honor to be, &c.
