SIR, 
</p><p>
I was duly honored with your favor of the 22d. 
and am much obliged by the expressions of politeness 
and friendship which it contains. A few months re 
laxation will, I hope, restore my health and constitution, and enable me still to contribute my feeble 
efforts, in some mode or other, to the advancement of 
the cause of freedom in America, If I should not 
return to Congress, it will be the height of my inclination, as it will also be in my power, to render 
some service to the general interest in my own native 
country. 
</p><p>
As I propose setting out on Monday, and shall go 
through <a href='/results.php?city=Bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>, I must request that the escort of 
horse you so politely offered to attend me, may meet 
me there. Should I reach <a href='/results.php?city=Bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a> before them, I 
shall wait their arrival. In the present critical state 
of our affairs, I believe I should decline setting out 
for a few days ; but, having wrote to Mrs. Hancock 
to meet me at some distance from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I am 
under a necessity of beginning my journey on Monday morning. I am, dear Sir, with great esteem and 
regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
