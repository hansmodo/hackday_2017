My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> gives me an opportunity 
of thanking you for your kind letter of the 25th . The 
intended expedition to Canada that gentleman had 
communicated to me the day before in confidence, 
and by giving me the perusal of his letter to you on 
the subject had discovered his aversion to a certain 
general as second in command. 
</p><p>
The policy of the enterprise does not appear to me 
good in our present circumstances, for altho numbers 
may be employed in this that could not be engaged in 
any other, counting volunteers from the Eastern states 
and the well affected of the country into which the war 
is carried, yet a certain quantity of strength and treasure will be employed, which might be better applied 
elsewhere. I am speaking on the supposition that it 
is impossible for us to hold our conquests in Canada, 
while the enemy continues superior to us by sea. 
</p><p>
Towns and fortifications and some military stores 
may be destroyed; the unhappy Canadians will be 
forced to side by turns with the party in possession, 
and experience the redoubled horrors of war. 
</p><p>
The organization of the force which we are to use, 
as far as we are acquainted with it here, does not give 
satisfaction. It is feared that the ambition and 
intriguing spirit of Con way will be subversive of the 
public good, while he will proceed securely behind 
the shield of his commanding officer, taking to 
himself the merit of every thing praiseworthy and 
attributing every misfortune to the ostensible head. 
The person who is appointed Q. master for this 
expedition, is said to be a man skilfull in enriching 
himself at the public expense. 
</p><p>
Our friend the M's . knowing the existence of a 
certain faction, and penetrating the character of his second, has prudently resolved to wait upon Congress, 
and to find out the extent of their views in sending 
forces into Canada, that he may act correspondently 
and not have the secret of their intentions deposited 
in another man while he has the command. 
</p><p>
I cannot altogether clear up the matter which you 
allude to. I think I told you in my first letters on the 
subject whence the general derived his knowledge of 
the existence of the insolent paragraph, and it does 
not appear extraordinary to me that a certain gentle 
man who was capable of writing it, should afterwards 
deny it. 
</p><p>
I am called upon to attend the general to his first 
official interview with the congressional committee, 
and have time only to repeat that I am ever, 
</p><p>
Your 
</p><p>
