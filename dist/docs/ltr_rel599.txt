My Dear Mrs. Davis:  Your letter of the 12th inst. reached Lexington
during my absence at Washington.  I have never seen Mr. Colfax's
speech, and am, therefore, ignorant of the statements it contained.
Had it, however, come under my notice, I doubt whether I should have
thought it proper to reply.  I HAVE THOUGHT, FROM THE TIME OF THE
CESSATION OF THE HOSTILITIES, THAT SILENCE AND PATIENCE ON THE PART
OF THE SOUTH WAS THE TRUE COURSE; and I think so still.  CONTROVERSY
OF ALL KINDS will, in my opinion, only serve to continue excitement
and passion, and will prevent the public mind from the acknowledgement
and acceptance of the truth.  These considerations have kept me from
replying to accusations made against myself, and induced me to recommend
the same to others.  As regards the treatment of the Andersonville
prisoners, to which you allude, I know nothing and can say nothing
of my own knowledge.  I never had anything to do with any prisoners,
except to send those taken on the fields, where I was engaged, to the
Provost Marshal General at Richmond.  I have felt most keenly the
sufferings and imprisonment of your <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed" rel="co-worker met">husband</a>, and have earnestly
consulted with friends as to any possible mode of affording him relief
and consolation.  He enjoys the sympathy and respect of all good men;
and if, as you state, his trial is now near, the exhibition of the
while truth in his case will, I trust, prove his defense and
justification.  With sincere prayers for his health and speedy
restoration to liberty, and earnest supplications to God that He may
take you and yours under His guidance and protection, I am, with great
respect,
</p><p>
                 Your obedient servant,
</p><p>
