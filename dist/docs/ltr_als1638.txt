My esteemed friend,
</p><p>
Each moment in which I receive one (letter) from you, I see (uniting themselves) more and more our ideas and our hearts. By my natural inclination I love thinking men, and if these men combine the patriotism and excellent sentiments that adorn you, we agree with one another quickly, and I am trying to bring closer the ( ) of a true and sincere friendship.
</p><p>
This is the pure truth, about how much respect I feel for you, and surely I would have (agreed to) your desire, marching to the Capital, if one had ( ) me that move on my terms, those honorable and convenient to my person and circumstances. I know that the two of us would have worked with much benefit to the nation; but that impenetrable veil that you have wanted to put in front of the view, that puppet, that has made me vacillate a lot, and (to confuse) as you say, a hidden ( )
</p><p>
that does not speak the truth of that which pertains to our illustrious friend. For my part I am calm in this ( ), I only feel your isolation, and I would like (I speak in good faith) to become two people, in order to move quickly to your side, without leaving this territory that today more than ever calls for a man resolved to my thinking.
</p><p>
I have not received one (letter or piece of news) from our friend Mr. Poinsett: during the day, with the quite positive news that has been presented to us of the coming of the Spanish expedition, I believe that my assent to that (Capital) will be slowed more and more. I do not want to cede the advance guard to anyone, and here is where is needed, now more than ever, a fully proven vigilance and activity.
</p><p>
You have, according to my view, much more patience than I. If those people had even come near me to speak to me of revolution, as God lives, they would not have attempted another. You told them very well, and you can if you want to repeat it to them, that the last breath of Santa Anna will be for his free, independent, and federated country. Yes my friend, I promise and I will sustain it against all those ( ) that attempt to interrupt us. Let them talk, in the end
they will produce the effect, seeing that they spend their saliva and their ink in vain, and that we continue our march with tranquility and serene valor.
</p><p>
Carry on, my good friend, and don’t faint in your laborious work: urge on that machine for the love of God: that Mr. Moctezuma be moved with violence, and don’t forget this well-deserving troop that is starving.
