DEAR SIR: It has become important to me, in consequence of a recent 
circumstance, to ascertain whether Gen. Jackson's letter to you of the 6th 
January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a> I mean the one in which allusion is made to Mr. J. Rhea  
was seen, when received, by any one except myself, and, if it was, by whom 
I will thank you to inform me by the return mail; and, also, whether the letter above alluded to was before the cabinet, or was alluded to by any of ite 
members, during the deliberation on the Seminole affair. 
</p><p>
With sincere regard, 
</p><p>
I am, &c. &c.
