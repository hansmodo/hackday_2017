THE AIR was bracing but not cold when at sunrise on the morning of the 4th, I took a seat with the driver on the box of the stage for Shasta City, whose local is among the foothills and at the very southern base of that rugged broken range of mountains which stretch from the extreme northern end of the Valley of the Sacramento through to Oregon, and thence in wild and solemn grandeur through the British and Russian possessions in North America, and interrupted only by the narrow Strait of Behring into Asia. Crossing the Sacramento as we left town, we were soon gaily rolling over the bosom of the broad Valley, with the bold dark outline of the Coast Range looming up on the west, and on the east the Sierra Nevada with its broad foothills seemed gradually to rise till at a great distance it blended with the sky like sombre clouds without indicating its own extreme altitude, still presenting a prominent and vivid component part in the charming view. Occasionally we were driving along the banks of the river through groves of evergreen oak and then launching out into a tule swamp miles in length, overflowed by the river in flood seasons, making a large lake, when about eleven o'clock we reached the city of Fremont, our first change This important town is situated near the confluence of Rio de las Plumas (Feather River) with the Sacramento, and stands an example of the speculative energy of the Californians of '49. Like every other town on a navigable stream it is at the head of navigation, though steamboats do run an hundred miles above. It contains about forty houses, twelve of which are occupied by families; the others are to rent on easy terms to any who would like a quiet nook far from the noise and bustle of the city. In the fall and winter of '49 it possessed extensive water privileges, for during the overflow the communications between the houses was by means of boats, and an acquaintance of mine who was the wealthy proprietor of eight hundreds lots in the city assured me the fishing on them was excellent. For any person desirous of making a permanent investment an excellent opportunity is offered here.

Leaving Fremont with its reminiscences, we drove along the Sacramento for a few miles, when our road launched out upon the plain, where for fifty miles there was no water, only in wells dug at
intervals of eighteen to twenty miles, and where much of the way the tules and vegetable mould indicated submersion in flood season, making it by no means a desirable location for the biped creation. The plain was dotted with large herds of elk, antelope, and deer which in seeming security scarcely moved beyond gunshot from us,barely raising their heads with curiosity as we passed, as if to enquire what the devil we were doing on their stamping ground, while we on our part were smacking our lips with the poetic thought of a broiled steak from their haunches. About sixty miles above Sacramento City, between the Sacramento and Feather rivers and about midway of the plain, rises a strange, queer, isolated old mountaincalled the Buttes, that looks as if it had been one of the hills which the fallen angels had used for ammunition in Milton's Paradise Lost. There it stands, where the Valley is twenty miles wide on either side, lifting its bare, craggy, misshapen, undescribable brown peaks two thousand feet towardsheaven, baring its rough brows to the elements, its furrowed and rent sides attesting the power of time and might of the Almighty, and a beacon to the bewildered traveler on the plain. It is one of the strange things of California which defies my power of description, and the only way I can get at it is to leave a blank thus, and let you fill it with an artist's pencil to suit your own imagining.

As the sun disappeared behind the dark hills of the Coast Range, his rays still shone brightly on the high crest of the Buttes, and it seemed as if twilight was approaching before the old mountain gave up the contest for light and fairly bade us good night. A little after dark we were sitting down to a glorious supper at the city of Colusa, a thriving capital of just twelve houses, beautifully situated on the west bank of the river and of course at the head of navigation--that is, for steamboats that don't run higher. Adjoining the town is a large village of Indians I was strolling along the river by starlight after having discussed a savory elk steak, when I was startled by an unearthly yell, a sound of lamentation from the direction of the Indian village. Curious to know the cause of this sudden outcry, I bent my steps in that direction. Before every lodge were seated several women and children who were piteously lamenting with tears of grief coursing down their cheeks, while in groups the men sat silent or talking in subdued tones, and I never saw a whole community who seemed more grief-stricken than these untutored and naked savages. An old warrior replied to my enquiry by informing me that five of their men had accompanied a gentleman of Colusa to the mines to dig for gold. Four of them had set out on their return
alone, when they were assaulted by the mountain Indians and two of them killed; the others, making their escape, had just arrived with the sad intelligence. With them it was a national calamity and their grief was as sincere as it was touching. And death was rife among them. Supported in the arms of three or four squaws a woman was dying. The death rattle was in her throat, and before morning she too was numbered with the dead. All night long the wailings were continued, and as we left early the following morning we observed a large circle of squaws dancing a slow and measured tread around the body of their departed sister. May the Great Spirit be propitiated and the soul of the poor savage be made happy accordingto its capacity.

Our nearest approach to the Coast Range was probably not nearer than fifteen miles. We could see that a range of lesser but rugged hills extended along the base of the main range with apparently a valley between them, but from this the mountains seemed to rise in broken and abrupt masses to a great height, more like the Sierra, from the desert on the eastern side of the snowy mountains. They appear too broken to admit of a wagon road, and only here and there show signs of vegetation, but up to this time it is a sealed and mysterious country opening a new field of enterprise and of toil to some future explorer. All I could learn was that a party of men had once attempted to make explorations. Teh mountains. They were gone from home six days, had ascertained that gold existed in the hills, that there were fine valleys with beautiful streams flowing through them and an abundance of magnificent pines, but that the country was inhabited by bold and warlike tribes who were hostile and treacherous and that an ingress among those lofty hills was attended with difficulty and danger But the time will soon come when the attention of the indomitable Yankee will be diverted from the eastern mountains towards the West, and then the tales of suffering, of toil and blood, of savage warfare and Christian cupidity, will find a locale in the broad, broken belt between the Pacific Ocean and the Valley of the Sacramento. As we approached the termination of the Valley towards the close of the third day, the ground became more uneven, and near Red Bluff we entered the foothills which were the stepping stones to the united ranges of the Coast and Sierra Nevada mountains. On the left were the lofty, rugged peaks of the Coast, before us the Trinity and Sacramentomountains stood out in bold relief, and on the east and north the Sierra was surmounted by the snow-clad points of Lawson's Peak and Shasta Butte, the latter rising like a white cloud an hundred and twenty miles distant, attaining the immense altitude of thirteen thousand feet The road
became more broken, the hills higher, till at dark we arrived at Shasta City, the extreme point attainable by wagons in this direction in the mountains. Beyond this, mules alone can thread the narrow and intricate passes of the hills, and the constant arrival and departure of large pack trains with supplies for thousands of miners in that isolated country gave the town an appearance of life and bustle quite unexpected.

Here the stores were well filled with merchandise, the hotels afforded comfortable quarters and their tables were loaded with not only the comforts but the luxuries of California, and the dream of hardship is only to be realized in the mountain country beyond. From this point northward it is necessary to go with some show of force and to keep a constant guard at night to prevent attacks from the Indians, and during the day it is not safe to leave the train even for a short distance. Yet an hundred and fifty miles north of Shasta City is a rich valley, thirty to fifty miles long by three to five wide, taking its name from the gigantic Butte at its head and affording a local habitation, even in this distant and isolated region, for another town of five hundred houses, called Shasta Butte City Would you believe it that such a town exists in this remote region? It is even so. Supplies are brought by mules from the south, while on the north a very feasible wagon road is opened to Oregon City, from whence supplies are also drawn; so that a communication is now open through the wildest imaginable country from California to Oregon. The geography of the Cascade Mountains is no longer a mystery, and the rivers are explored, rich valleys are found, and their cultivation already begun. The northern Indians are a larger, more intelligent and more warlike race than those of California. They wear clothes and live in log or wood dwellings and are very ingenious in many articles of domestic manufacture, while a portion of their country is valuable for agricultural purposes

In the neighborhood of Shasta I observed vast quantities of auriferous quartz, more than can be exhausted in hundreds of years, and I also saw many specimens which were brought in from Shasta Butte City, from Scott and Trinity rivers and their affluents, indeed in all directions, north and eastward, for an hundred miles or more. The imagination can scarcely stop at estimating the amount of mineral wealth still existing undistrubed in its matrix in the northern mountains; yet, while it is there, men will not stop to calculate the expense, the difficulty and hazard of life in obtaining it.
