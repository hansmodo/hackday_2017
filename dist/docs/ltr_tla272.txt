<p><i>Biographer's Preface</i></p>
<p>
It was not until he was seventeen years old that Sam Clemens wrote a
letter any portion of which has survived.  He was no longer in
Hannibal.  <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a>'s unprosperous enterprise did not satisfy him.
His wish to earn money and to see the world had carried him first to
St. Louis, where his sister Pamela was living, then to New York
City, where a World's Fair in a Crystal Palace was in progress.
The letter tells of a visit to this great exhibition.  It is not
complete, and the fragment bears no date, but it was written during
the summer of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1853">1853</a>.

<p>Fragment of a letter from Sam L.  Clemens to his sister Pamela Moffett, in St. Louis, summer of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1853">1853</a>:</p>

<p>.  .  .  From the gallery (second floor) you have a glorious sight--the
flags of the different countries represented, the lofty dome, glittering
jewelry, gaudy tapestry, &c., with the busy crowd passing to and fro--tis
a perfect fairy palace--beautiful beyond description.
</p>
<p>The Machinery department is on the main floor, but I cannot enumerate any
of it on account of the lateness of the hour (past 8 o'clock.) It would
take more than a week to examine everything on exhibition; and as I was
only in a little over two hours tonight, I only glanced at about
one-third of the articles; and having a poor memory; I have enumerated
scarcely any of even the principal objects.  The visitors to the Palace
average 6,000 daily--double the population of Hannibal.  The price of
admission being 50 cents, they take in about $3,000.
</p>
<p>The Latting Observatory (height about 280 feet) is near the Palace--from
it you can obtain a grand view of the city and the country round.  The
Croton Aqueduct, to supply the city with water, is the greatest wonder
yet.  Immense sewers are laid across the bed of the Hudson River, and
pass through the country to Westchester county, where a whole river is
turned from its course, and brought to New York.  From the reservoir in
the city to the Westchester county reservoir, the distance is
thirty-eight miles! and if necessary, they could supply every family
in New York with one hundred barrels of water per day!
</p>
<p>I am very sorry to learn that Henry has been sick.  He ought to go to the
country and take exercise; for he is not half so healthy as Ma thinks he
is.  If he had my walking to do, he would be another boy entirely.  Four
times every day I walk a little over one mile; and working hard all day,
and walking four miles, is exercise--I am used to it, now, though, and it
is no trouble.  Where is it <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a>'s going to?  Tell Ma my promises are
faithfully kept, and if I have my health I will take her to Ky. in the
spring--I shall save money for this.  Tell Jim and all the rest of them
to write, and give me all the news.  I am sorry to hear such bad news
from Will and Captain Bowen.  I shall write to Will soon.  The
Chatham-square Post Office and the Broadway office too, are out of my
way, and I always go to the General Post Office; so you must write the
direction of my letters plain, "New York City, N. Y.," without giving the
street or anything of the kind, or they may go to some of the other
offices.  (It has just struck 2 A.M.  and I always get up at 6, and am
at work at 7.) You ask me where I spend my evenings.  Where would you
suppose, with a free printers' library containing more than 4,000 volumes
within a quarter of a mile of me, and nobody at home to talk to?  I shall
write to Ella soon.  Write soon
</p>
                         <p>Truly your Brother</p>
                                             <br/>SAM.

<p>P. S.  I have written this by a light so dim that you nor Ma could not read by it.</p>
