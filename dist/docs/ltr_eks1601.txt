My last hurried note was written from the battle 
field the morning after the desperate action of Resaca 
de la Palma. I hope you will receive my letter before 
you are made anxious by the newspapers. That I 
was not killed is wonderful as I was in the ravine 
where so many fell closely engaged with a much superior force, and I cannot express my gratitude to a 
kind God who yet spares me. During the tenth much 
was done to clear the field of the dead. I saw eighty- 
three in one pile already partially decomposed by the 
side of the pit into which they were to be thrown. 
Many hundreds were lying about and the vultures 
were already at their widespread feast, the wolves 
howling and fighting over their dreadful meal. Before 
morning the scent of the carnage became almost 
insupportable. On the eleventh we marched to Fort 
Brown, named after its gallant defender who was 
killed in it by a shell on the fourth. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> 
and the wounded went to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a>. Poor Move s 
right arm was amputated near the shoulder. He is 
doing well. Colonels Mclntosh and Payne are in 
great danger.

On the seventeenth <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> having returned 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a> we were ordered a few miles up the 
river where preparations had been made to cross and 
invest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>. 
</p><p>
On the eighteenth the passage commenced, the 
enemy offering no opposition. A few companies as 
skirmishers, a squadron of Dragoons and a field battery of four pieces were over and the Fifth on the 
move when we learned that Arista with his entire 
force, still forty-five hundred strong, were in full retreat. We crossed and the residue of the army went 
down the river and passed over at the town. We 
marched immediately to the city, five miles, and soon 
saw our flag floating over the Mexican fort. We halted 
without our baggage in a ploughed field in the suburbs, 
not being allowed to enter the city, and lay down upon 
the bare ground tired and hungry enough. Towards 
night the interdict was removed and I went to town 
where I soon succeeded in getting a good cup of coffee 
and a piece of bread at a restaurant. The town is 
much like St. Augustine, only with larger, wider streets 
and finer public buildings. Strong patrols were kept 
moving through the streets to protect the inhabitants 
and prevent riot. We found near four hundred of 
Arista s wounded whom he had left in the hospital 
when he fled. It is thought that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> will 
move towards <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, a large fortified city three 
hundred miles on the road to the City of Mexico, but 
no one knows with certainty what he will do. ... 
How long we remain inactive where we are is very 
uncertain. The volunteers are arriving in great numbers and an immense wagon train must be collected 
before we can move forward upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> which we 
think is the first point at which the enemy can make 
a decided stand. By the road it is nearly three hundred miles here to that town.
