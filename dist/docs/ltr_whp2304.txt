MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>,
</p><p>
I came to this place yesterday in the afternoon, and regret extremely
that I did not arrive earlier in the day, as I should have received
your letter. My stay here will be uncertain. At home I must be by the
beginning of April. I should be happy in seeing you before my return,
but how to effect it is the question. If I could possibly disengage
myself from business, I would take a ride to Paramus. My best respects
await on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thb" rel="met friend">Mrs. Prevost</a>; and every thing you think proper to the
mistress of your affections. I am married, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>, and happy. May you be
equally so. I cannot form a higher or a better wish. You know I should
rejoice to meet you. Tell <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thb" rel="met friend">Mrs. Prevost</a> that I shall take it unkindly
if she does not call upon me whenever she thinks I can be of any
service to her. To oblige her will give me pleasure for her own sake,
and double pleasure for yours. This is a strange, unconnected scroll;
you have it as it comes.
</p><p>
I congratulate you on your return to civil life, for which (I cannot
forbear the thought) we must thank a certain lady not far from
Paramus. May I have occasion soon to thank her on another account; and
may I congratulate you both in the course of the next moon for being
in my line: I mean the married. Adieu.
</p><p>
I am most sincerely yours,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whp" rel="me">WILLIAM PATERSON</a>.
