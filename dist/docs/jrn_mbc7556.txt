<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='23'>23d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Note the glaring inconsistencies of life. Our chatelaine locked up Eugene Sue, and returned even 
Washington Allston's novel with thanks and a decided hint that it should be burned ; at least it should not remain 
in her house. Bad books are not allowed house room, except in the library under lock and key, the key in the Master's 
pocket ; but bad women, if they are not white, or serve in a menial capacity, may swarm the house unmolested; the 
ostrich game is thought a Christian act. Such women are no more regarded as a dangerous contingent than canary birds would be.

If you show by a chance remark that you see some particular creature, more shameless than the rest, has no end 
of children, and no beginning of a husband, you are frowned down; you are talking on improper subjects. 
There are certain subjects pure-minded ladies never touch upon, even in their thoughts. It does not do to be so hard 
and cruel. It is best to let the sinners alone, poor things. If they are good servants otherwise, do not dismiss them; 
all that will come straight as they grow older, and it does ! They are frantic, one and all, to be members of the church. 
The Methodist Church is not so pure-minded as to shut its eyes ; it takes them up and turns them out with a high hand 
if they are found going astray as to any of the ten commandments.
