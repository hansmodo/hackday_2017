Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The object of this is merely to transmit a letter forwarded to 
me by Mr Cathalan, who desires me to communicate the 
scarcity to my friends, and at the same time mentions, that if 
I will encourage him thereto, he will immediately set off to 
America to procure wheat. My answer of this date is 
enclosed. 
</p><p>
By the first convenient opportunity I shall write to you 
respecting the state of things here, and I shall now send with 
this letter the several gazettes. We have had one week of 
unchecked murders, in which some thousands have perished in 
this city. It began with between two and three hundred of 
the clergy, who had been shut up because they would not 
take the oaths prescribed by the law, and which they said 
were contrary to their conscience. Thence, these executors 
of speedy justice went to the Abbaye, where the persons were 
confined, who were at court on the tenth of August. These 
were despatched also, and afterwards they visited the other 
prisons. All those who were confined either on the accusation, 
or suspicion of crimes, were destroyed. Madame de Lamballe 
was, I believe, the only woman killed, and she was beheaded 
and embowelled, the head and entrails paraded on pikes 
through the streets, and the body dragged after them. They 
continued I am told in the neighborhood of the Temple, until 
the Queen looked out at this horrid spectacle. 
</p><p>
Yesterday the prisoners from Orleans were put to death at 
Versailles. The destruction began here about five in the 
afternoon on Sunday, the second instant. A guard had been 
sent a few days since to make the Duke de la Rochefoucault 
prisoner. He was on his way to Paris under their escort with 
his wife and mother, when he was taken out of his carriage 
and killed. The ladies were taken back to la Roche Guyonne 
where they are now in a state of arrestation. Monsieur de 
Montmorin was among those slain at the Abbaye. You will 
recollect, that a petition was signed by many thousands to 
displace the Mayor on account of his conduct on the twentieth 
of June. The signing of this petition is considered as a sufficient proof of the crime of Feuillantism, and it was in contemplation with some to put all those who were guilty of signing 
that petition to death. This measure seems, however, to be 
suspended, for the present at least ; but as there is no real 
executive authority, the plan may be easily resumed, should it 
suit the views of those who enjoy the confidence of that part 
of the people, who are now active. I am, &c.
