MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE sensations of 19th <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, and those of this 
morning, have some resemblance to each other. A 
prospect of foreign war and civil war in conjunction, 
is not very pleasant. We are a poor, divided nation, 
in the midst of all our prosperity. The House of 
Representatives, after debating three weeks about 
asking for papers, are now beginning another discus 
sion, which may last as long, on the merits and de 
merits of the treaty. If the House refuse to make 
the appropriations, it is difficult to see how we can 
avoid war, and it is not easier to find out how we can 
preserve this government from dissolution. We must, 
however, coolly and patiently study and search for 
the means and resources which may be left to avoid 
war and support government. Mr. Swift and Mr. Good hue have spoken ably in favor of the treaty, 
and Mr. Nicholas and Mr. Giles spoke more moderately against it than was expected.

I had no letter from you yesterday. Briesler says 
the mail goes now three times a week, on Tuesdays, 
Thursdays, and Saturdays. I shall endeavor to write 
by each, though it may he but a line of remembrance. 
I hope your indisposition was not a grave one ; but 
the omission of a letter yesterday gave me some 
fears. 
</p><p>
I cannot deny the right of the House to ask for 
papers, nor to express their opinions upon the merits 
of a treaty. My ideas are very high of the rights arid 
powers of the House of Representatives. These 
powers may be abused, and in this instance there is 
great danger that they will be. Such a combination 
of party motives as debts, anti-federalism and French 
influence, seldom occurs to overawe the members and 
lead them into party violence. But the faith and hon 
or of the nation are pledged, and though the House 
cannot approve, they ought to feel themselves bound. 
Some persons still think the House will comply. But 
there is an inveteracy and obstinacy on this occasion 
such as I scarcely ever saw. The pride of Madison, 
Giles, Baldwin, ill brooking the superior powers of the 
Senate, emulating the dignity and lustre of members 
of that body, ardently struggling to rival an Ellsworth, 
a King, &c. These are feelings that our law-givers, 
in framing our constitution, did not advert to. The 
elections of the two Houses by such different bodies 
as the people and their legislators, will always leave 
this difficulty in full force. The leading members of 
the House, such as Madison, and Baldwin, should have 
been ere now senators.

But I must not speculate. I must come to some 
thing more pleasing, assurances of the perpetual affection of
