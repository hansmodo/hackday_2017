I SEE with pleasure, that we think pretty much alike on 
the subject of English America. We of the colonies have 
never insisted, that we ought to be exempt from contributing 
to the common expenses necessary to support the prosperity 
of the empire. We only assert, that, having Parliaments 
of our own, and not having representatives in that of Great 
Britain, our Parliaments are the only judges of what we can 
and what we ought to contribute in this case; and that the 
English Parliament has no right to take our money without 
our consent. In fact, the British empire is not a single state ; 
it comprehends many; and, though the Parliament of Great 
Britain has arrogated to itself the power of taxing the colonies, 
it has no more right to do so, than it has to tax Hanover. 
We have the same King, but not the same legislatures.

The dispute between the two countries has already lost 
England many millions sterling, which it has lost in its commerce, and America has in this respect been a proportionable gainer. This commerce consisted principally of superfluities ; 
objects of luxury and fashion, which we can well do without ; 
and the resolution we have formed of importing no more, till 
our grievances are redressed, has enabled many of our infant 
manufactures to take root; and it will not be easy to make 
our people abandon them in future, even should a connexion 
more cordial than ever succeed the present troubles. I 
have, indeed, no doubt that the Parliament of England will 
finally abandon its present pretensions, and leave us to the 
peaceable enjoyment of our rights and privileges.
