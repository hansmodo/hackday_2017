HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF OCCUPATION, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=agua nueia" rel="city">Agua Nueia</a>, March 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
<p></p>
SIR : I have had the honor to receive your communication of January 27th, enclosing 
a newspaper slip, and expressing the regret of the Department that the letter copied in, 
that slip, and which was addressed by myself to Major General Gaines, should have 
been published. 
<p></p>
Although your letter does not convey the direct censure of the Department or of the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">President</a>, yet, when it is taken in connexion wiih the revival of a paragraph in the regulations of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>, touching the publication of private letters concerning operations in the 
field, I am not permitted to doubt that I have become the subject of Executive disapprobation. To any expression of it, coming with the authority of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">President</a>, I am 
bound by my duty, and by my respect for his high office, patiently to submit; but, lest 
my silence should be construed into a tacit admission of the grounds and conclusions set 
forth in your communication, I deem it a duty which I owe to myself to submit a few 
remarks in reply. I shall be pardoned for speaking plainly. 
<p></p>
In the first place, the published letter bears upon its face the most conclusive evidence 
that it was intended only for private perusal, and not at all for publication. It was published without my knowledge, and contrary to my wishes. Surely, 1 need not say that 
I am not in the habit of writing for the newspapers. The letter was a familiar one, 
written to an old military friend, with whom I have for many years interchanged opinions on professional subjects. That he should think proper, under any circumstances, to 
publish it could not have been foreseen by me. 
<p></p>
In the absence of proof that the publication was made with my authority or knowledge, I may be permitted to say that the quotation in your letter of the six hundred and 
fiftieth paragraph of the superseded regulations of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>, in which the terms " mischievous" and " disgraceful" are employed to characterize certain letters or reports, conveys, 
though not openly, a measure of rebuke which, to say the least, is rather harsh, and 
which many may think not warranted by the premises. Again: I have carefully examined the letter in question, and I do not admit that it is. obnoxious to ihe objections 
urged in your communication. I see nothing in it which, under the same circumstances, 
I would not write again. To suppose that it will give the enemy valuable information, 
touching our past or prospective line of operations, is lo know very little of the Mexican 
sources of information, or of their extraordinary sagacity and facilities in keeping constantly apprized of our movements. 
<p></p>
As to my particular views in regard to the general policy to be pursued towards Mexico, 
I perceive by the public journals that they are shared by many distinguished statement, 
and also in part by a conspicuous officer of the navy, the publication of whose opinions 
is not perhaps obstructed by any regulations of his Department. It is difficult, then, to 
imagine that the diffusion of mine can render any peculiar aid to the enemy, or specially 
disincline him " to enter into negotiations for peace." 
<p></p>
In conclusion, I would say that it has given me great pain to be brought into the position in which I now find myself with regard to the Department of War and the Govern 
ment. It has not been of my own seeking. To the extent of my ability, and the means 
placed at my disposal, I have sought faithfully to serve the country by carrying out the 
wishes and instructions of the Executive. But it cannot be concealed that since the capitulation of Monterey the confidence of the Department, and I too much fear of the Presi 
dent, has been gradually withdrawn, and my consideration and usefulness correspond 
ingly diminished. The apparent determination of the Department to place rne in an 
attitude antagonistical to the Government has an apt illustration in the well-known fable 
of Esop.* But I ask no favor, and I shrink from no responsibility. While entrusted 
with the command in this quarter I shall continue to devote all my energies to the public 
good, looking for my reward to the consciousness of pure motives and the final verdict of 
impartial history. 
<p></p>
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="me">Z. TAYLOR</a>, 
<p></p>
Maj. Gen. U. S. A., commanding. 
<p></p>
Hon. W. L. MARCY, Secretary of War, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>.
