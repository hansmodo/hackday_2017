Dear Brother : . . . Should I on my arrival find the 
Secretary determined to go outside the Army, and should 
he make advances to me, of course I shall accept. In like 
manner if he tenders me a brigade, I will do my best, or 
if a colonelcy ditto. I still feel that it is wrong to ask 
for anything and prefer that they should make their 
own choice of this position for me. You are with Gen. 
Patterson. There are two A No. 1 men there, George H. 
Thomas Col. Second Cavalry and Cap. Sykes 3 Infantry. 
Mention my name to both and say to them that I wish 
them all the success they aspire to, and if in the varying 
chances of war I should ever be so placed, I would name 
such as them for high places. But Thomas is a Virginian 
from near Norfolk and say what we may he must feel 
unpleasantly at leading an invading Army. But if he 
says he will do it, I know he will do it well. He was 
never brilliant but always cool, reliable and steady, 
maybe a little slow. Sykes has in him some dashing 
qualities. ... If possible I will try and see you in 
your new capacity of soldier before I make another distinct break. If J T OU please you may telegraph to Mr. 
Chase simply that I have come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> on 
Taylor's call, but I cannot wait long, and if the Administration don't want my services, to say so at once emphatically. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
