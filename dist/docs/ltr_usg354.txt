MY DEAR MR. CORBIN:
</p><p>
I am in receipt of your letter of December <a href="/results.php?year=1877">'77</a> at this remote, but
historically interesting quarter of the globe. We have been in Cairo
since last Tuesday. This is Sunday. I have seen the city very
thoroughly; visited the pyramids; the Virgin Mary's tree where she took
shelter some twenty centuries ago; the spring which became sweet from
being saline, on her quenching her thirst from it, and which remains
sweet to this day,--while I was there water was being pumped from it,
by ox power, with a revolving wheel, to irrigate the neighboring
ground--; Heliopolis, the great seat of learning in the days of Moses,
and where he was taught, and where the father-in-law of Joseph was a
teacher. The tree and the well are at Heliopolis, about six miles from
here.
</p><p>
On Tuesday we start up the Nile on a special steamer provided by the
Khedive. We expect to go as far as to the first rapids stopping at all
the points of interest on the way. This will probably take three weeks.
On our return we expect to go to Suez, thence by Canal to Port Said,
and then take our steamer again. From Port Said we will go to Joppa and
out to Jerusalem. Returning to Joppa we will go to Beirout, and out to
Damascus--possibly diverging to visit Baalbec, thence to Smyrna from
which we will visit Ephesus, thence to Constantinople. Returning we
will stop a few days at Athens, thence to old Syracuse on the island of
Sicily, then to some convenient point on the Italian coast from which
to reach Rome. We will remain in Rome for several weeks. Should you
write me any time within six weeks from this directed to the care of
our Minister at Rome, the letter will reach me.
</p><p>
Altogether we have had a most pleasant visit. Our return to America
during this year depends somewhat on circumstances, principally the
means to stay away longer. It is likely this will be the last
opportunity I shall ever have of travelling abroad and I am desirous of
making the most of the pleasant opportunity.--Give our love to Mother,
Jennie and Mary, and accept my thanks for your kind offers.
</p><p>
Very truly yours,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
