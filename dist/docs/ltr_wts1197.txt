Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
Of course I don't profess to understand either your 
bill or Mr. Morton's. I should like to see a consolidated 
5 per cent bond gradually substituted to replace the present bonds, to the extent of 2000 millions, requiring 100 
millions annually for interest, and a greenback for the 
balance of debt, say five hundred millions, and all other 
paper money withdrawn and prohibited. I think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> 
won't commit himself to more than the general idea that 
the debt is sacred, and leave Congress to devise the ways 
and means. He will of course try all means of practical 
economy. I agree with him perfectly that no more 
money subsidies on land grants should be made now or 
until the debt is in good shape. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
