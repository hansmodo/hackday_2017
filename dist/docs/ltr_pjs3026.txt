DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
By the unanimous advice of all the General Officers, I have moved the army to this place. We propose to fortify our camp, in hopes that re-enforcements will enable us to keep our ground, and prevent the enemy from penetrating further into the 
country. But if I should be asked from whence I 
expect reinforcements, I should be at a loss for an 
answer, not having heard a word from the Massachusetts on my repeated applications ; nor am I certain 
that Connecticut will afford us any succour. Our 
Continental force is daily decreasing by desertion, 
sickness, and loss in skirmishes with the enemy ; and 
not a man of the militia, now with me, will remain 
above one week longer. And whilst our force is diminishing, that of the enemy augments by a constant 
acquisition of Tories ; but if we, by any means, could 
be put in a situation of attacking the enemy, and 
giving them a repulse, their retreat would be so 
extremely difficult that, in all probability, they would 
lose the greater part of their army. I am, dear 
General, most respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
