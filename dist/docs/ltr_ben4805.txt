LOVING COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I suppose Jonathan has told you, that the lottery is drawn, 
and your two new tickets had the same success as the former, 
namely, one twenty-pound prize, and one blank. Would 
you go on any further?

Josiah is very happy in being under the tuition of Mr. Stanley, who very kindly undertook him at my request, 
though he had left off teaching. Josiah goes constantly, too, 
to several concerts, besides operas and oratorios, so that his 
thirst for music is in a way of being thoroughly satiated. 
This is the principal expense; for, in all other respects, I 
never saw two young men from America more prudent and 
frugal, than he and his brother are.

Jonathan seems to have an excellent turn for business, 
and to be a perfect master of accounts. In the latter he has 
been of great use to me, having put all mine in order for me. 
There is a proposal from his uncle of his going to East India, 
as a writer in the Company's service, which I wish may take 
place, as I think, if he lives, he cannot fail bringing home a fortune. He had ordered a cargo of goods to be sent you for 
cousin Wood's shop, and had given expectations of paying 
ready money. But, one of your bills being protested, there 
seemed a necessity of asking some credit of the merchant. 
I advised him to take what was wanting of me, rather than 
fail in punctuality to his word, which is sacred here among all 
that would maintain a character in trade. He did so; and 
thereby also saved the discount without putting me to the 
least inconvenience, provided the money is replaced in six 
months ; and I was glad I had it in my power to accommodate him. 
</p><p>
I hope you have before this time got another tenant for 
your house, and at the former rent. However, I would have 
you go on advancing to my sister the amount of it, as I am 
persuaded she cannot well do without it. She has, indeed, 
been very unfortunate in her children. I am glad to hear, 
that, as soon as the weather permits, the tomb will receive 
a thorough repair. Your kind care in this matter will greatly 
</p><p>
oblige your affectionate uncle, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
