<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='17'>17th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. The Bazaar for the benefit of the hospitals opens now. <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> marches constantly. All the 
railroads are smashed, and if I laugh at any mortal thing it is that I may not weep. Generals are as plenty as blackberries, but none are in command.

The Peace Commissioner, Blair, came. They say he gave <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> the kiss of peace. And we send Stephens, 
Campbell, all who have believed in this thing, to negotiate for peace. No hope, no good. Who dares hope 
</p><p>
Repressed excitement in church. A great railroad character was called out. He soon returned and whispered something to <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> and they went out together. Somehow the whisper moved around to us 
that <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> was at Branchville. " Grant us patience, good Lord" was prayed aloud. " Not <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Ulysses Grant</a>, good 
Lord," murmured Teddy, profanely. <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> came yesterday. He is staying at the Prestons with Jack. They sent 
for us. What a heartfelt greeting he gave us. He can stand well enough without his crutch, but he does very slow 
walking. How plainly he spoke out dreadful words about my defeat and discomfiture ; my army destroyed, my 
losses, " etc., etc. He said he had nobody to blame but him self. A telegram from <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> to-day to my husband. 
He does not know whether <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> intends to advance on Branchville, Charleston, or Columbia Isabella said: " Maybe you attempted the impossible," and began one of her merriest stories. Jack Preston touched 
me on the arm and we slipped out. " He did not hear a 
word she was saying. He has forgotten us all. Did you notice how he stared in the fire? And the lurid spots which 
came out in his face and the drops of perspiration that stood on his forehead?" "Yes. He is going over some 
bitter scene ; he sees Willie Preston with his heart shot away. He sees the panic at Nashville and the dead on the battle 
field at Franklin." " That agony on his face comes again and again," said tender-hearted Jack. " I can't keep him 
out of those absent fits."

Governor McGrath and General Winder talk of preparations for a defense of Columbia. If <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> can't 
stop <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> down there, what have we got here to do it with? Can we check or impede his march? Can any one?

Last night General Hampton came in. I am sure he would do something to save us if he were put in supreme 
command here. Hampton says <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> is equal, if not superior, to <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> as a commanding officer.

My silver is in a box and has been delivered for safe keeping to Isaac McLaughlin, who is really my beau-ideal 
of a grateful negro. I mean to trust him. My husband cares for none of these things now, and lets me do as I please.

Tom Archer died almost as soon as he got to Richmond. Prison takes the life out of men. He was only half-alive 
when here. He had a strange, pallid look and such a vacant stare until you roused him. Poor pretty Sally Archer: 
that is the end of you.
