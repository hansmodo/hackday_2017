HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,

Dear Brother : . . . The President is sensibly better 
to-day, and all the friends and family feel encouraged. 
If to-morrow he be on the upward mend I shall go to New 
York, New London, Worcester, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, to be gone 
ten days, but if you have occasion to write, the letter 
will be forwarded. But you may be sure that I shall be 
here in case of necessity. The Cabinet desire that the 
prisoner, Guiteau, be regularly tried by the courts. We 
can defend the jail against the world, unless there be 
treachery. But when the time comes to take him from 
the jail to the court-house we cannot use soldiers, for 
the law prohibits their use as a posse comitatus. I apprehend no violence here even if the President dies, but 
sooner or later Guiteau will die. The feeling is too 
universal for him ever to escape. 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
