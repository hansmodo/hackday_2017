<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='17'>17th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. Back to the Congaree House to await my husband, who has made a rapid visit to the Wateree region. 
As we drove up Mr. Chesnut said : "Did you see the stare 
of respectful admiration E. R. bestowed upon you, so curiously prolonged ? I could hardly keep my countenance. 
" Yes, my dear child, I feel the honor of it, though my individual self goes for nothing in it. I am the wife of the 
man who has the appointing power just now, with so many 
commissions to be filled. I am nearly forty, and they do my 
understanding the credit to suppose I can be made to believe they admire my mature charms. They think they fool 
me into thinking that they believe me charming. There is 
hardly any farce in the world more laughable.

Last night a house was set on fire ; last week two houses. The red cock crows in the barn ! Our troubles thicken, 
indeed, when treachery comes from that dark quarter.

When the President first offered Johnston Pettigrew a brigadier-generalship, his answer was : Not yet. Too 
many men are ahead of me who have earned their promotion in the field. I will come after them, not before. So 
far I have done nothing to merit reward, etc. He would not take rank when he could get it. I fancy he may cool his 
heels now waiting for it. He was too high and mighty. There was another conscientious man Burnet, of Kentucky. He gave up his regiment to his lieutenant-colonel when he found the lieutenant-colonel could command the 
regiment and Burnet could not maneuver it in the field. He went into the fight simply as an aide to Floyd. Modest 
merit just now is at a premium.

William Gilmore Simms is here ; read us his last poetry ; have forgotten already what it was about. It was not tire some, however, and that is a great thing when people will persist in reading their own rhymes.

I did not hear what Mr. Preston was saying. " The last piece of Richmond news, Mr. Chesnut said as he went 
away, and he looked so fagged out I asked no questions. I knew it was bad. 
</p><p>
At daylight there was a loud knocking at my door. I 
hurried on a dressing-gown and flew to open the door. 
;&lt; Mrs. Chesnut, Mrs. M. says please don't forget her son. 
Mr. Chesnut, she hears, has come back. Please get her son a 
commission. He must have an office." I shut the door in 
the servant's face. If I had the influence these foolish 
people attribute to me why should I not help my own? I 
have a brother, two brothers-in-law, and no end of kin, all 
gentlemen privates, and privates they would stay to the end of time before they said a word to me about commissions. After a long talk we were finally disgusted and the men went off to the bulletin-board. Whatever else it shows, 
good or bad, there is always woe for some house in the killed and wounded. We have need of stout hearts. I feel a 
sinking of mine as we drive near the board.
