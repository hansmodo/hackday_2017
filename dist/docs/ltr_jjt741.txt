Dear Sister
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of receiving your letter directed to New York but the same day I received orders to attend as a member of a general court martial at this place which is about a hundred miles distant (east) of Pittsburgh {following 17 words are marked out with heavy ink}...in your own house on the 10th of October which is earlier than you even requested. As I have already given you my reasons for not coming this fall it is unnecessary to state that I may make sacrifices in visiting you. But on reading your letter I concluded that I would use my influence to do that which I so much desire to do (to visit you). But as yet, the court has not adjourned, and I have not yet got my leave of absence granted, but Capt. Taylor told me that he would not only approve of it, but recommend it, but before I can get it, I must obtain the permission of the Colonel of my Regt. and of the Secretary of War. But should I not arrive by the time specified, do not have anxiety about it. If it be unsuccessful the fault shall not be mine.

There are many very interesting ladies here, and there has been almost a soiree every day since my arrival, and at which I have enjoyed myself well. When I obtain my leave, should I get it, you must not expect me to stay with you more than a month. And I hope that your health will be much improved by that time. You need not write to me, until you receive another letter from me, as I cannot say where I may be any coming day. Remember me to Mr. Arnold, your family, and my other friends. My health I think, is still improving.
