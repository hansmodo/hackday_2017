DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I arrived here last evening, and this morning paid my 
respects to the Secretary of State, who introduced me to the 
President. I find that it is their wish that I should be as 
expeditious in my departure as possible. I told the Secretary that the state of my own affairs would render my re 
turn to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> previous to my departure extremely eligible 
to myself. He inquired whether it would be indispensable. 
I replied that in my present situation I could view nothing 
as indispensable that could relate to my own affairs, and if 
the public service required it, I should be prepared to go 
from hence or from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. He has allotted me about 
ten days to spend in his office in obtaining the necessary 
information, and I expect it will be required of me to proceed 
immediately after from hence or from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Of this 
however I am not yet certain. I shall write you again as 
soon as I shall have any foundation for certainty upon the 
subject. . .
