My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your several letters of the 10th  12th  15th  & i8 th ult with several 
newspapers, & a number of slips cut from others, containing a number of 
interesting articles has just reached me ; but the most gratifying was to 
hear all at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> as well as yourself continued in the enjoyment of 
good health, which I sincerely hope will long continue to be the case. I 
have great apprehensions on your acc from the effects of the contageon, 
alth I observe from the papers printed in the city as well as from your 
letters that the deaths p r day had greatly diminished, but it may be owing 
to the decrease of unacclimated persons for it to lay hold of; be this as it 
may I hope you will avoid as far as possible placing yourself in a position 
which would in any way promote your taking it, as well as to keep the 
system constantly prepared to meet it should it come, so that there would 
be no danger of an unfavorable result. It was a source of much pleasure 
to me to learn that Rob had arrived safe at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> ; as it must have 
relieved both you & his mother from the deepest anxiety on acc r of his 
safety, & most sincerely do I hope he is now established safely at the 
school at which it was intended he should go, & that he will remain there, 
as well as profit by the instruction he will receive, until you may think 
proper to remove him to some other institution, or to get him in business 
of some kind or profession, whenever he is prepared for it 
</p><p>
I was very much gratified at the receipt of the extract of John letter 
which is quite an interesting one, & does him much credit ; & is the best 
evidence that he could offer of his determination to succeed in the pro 
fession he has adopted ; there is in it nothing like complaining as to the 
restraints he is placed under, or the hardships of the duties assigned him ; 
I hope he will not neglect his studies, but will devote every spare moment 
from his official duties to the acquiring scientific information, as well as the 
knowledge of some of the languages which will be beneficial to him in 
the way of his profession. There is nothing more important to insure a 
young man a high standing either in the army or navy than literary 
attainments, & a taste for study if he has books &c will be a source of 
amusement as well as occupation which will prevent his time by resorting 
to them from hanging heavy on his hands, & froMresorting to certain 
means to kill time which so frequently results in the- destruction of so 
many young men in both arms of the public service. I have been thus 
tedious in dwelling on Johns letter as I take the deepest interest in all 
that concerns him. I consider his outfit rather a costly affair, & think 
he should try to live on his means or pay ; economy is a virtue so far as 
it respects ones living on their means or income 
Anns time must have passed & will continue to do so at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> 
anything but pleasantly, on ace of your position & the absence of the 
boys, especially so until she has heard of Robs safe arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>. 
I hope she will be able to join you by the last of the present month with 
out running any risk from disease of any kind ; or if healthy at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> 
they might all return there by the 2O th ins t by embarking at Carrilton ; I 
know they will be heartily tired of the pass by that time & anxious to 
get away

On the subject of my letters in reply to those of a few of those I 
receive by every mail I have been pretty guard in my reply to them, 
alth I did not expect they would have been published, as no permission 
was given to that effect written or implied but in one instance, had I have 
known they would have been made matter of newspaper discussion, I 
should have been more circumspect in my language ; however as I before 
stated I do not care a flint whether I am elected or not, & expect accord 
ing to custom in like cases, to be assailed with great bitterness up to the 
time for holding the election if kept before the country as a candidate, 
whether I write letters or not. I will however be more guarded in what 
I write for the time to come, & whenever I deem it necessary & proper 
to reply to letters, I intend to make as little allusion as possible to political matters, as well as to mark the same private, which must prevent any 
evil consequences arising from the same

The death of S. Wright will very possible make some changes 
among the democratic party; had he lived I think it quite likely he would 
have been their candidate for the presidency at the coming election ; & 
think him the best man among them ; who will occupy his position it is 
impossible to say, I imagine it will be Cass or Buchanan. 
</p><p>
As to your remarks about Dicks going through New Orleans with 
out calling at the Barracks, do not understand me as supposing that you 
were in the least put out by his failing to do what he ought to have done ; 
but it is to me matter of vexation to me he should have evinced such 
marked indifference towards those so nearly connected with him, but from 
whom he had received so many acts of kindness. I rec d a letter from 
Betty dated the 10th  of Sep r saying they were all quite well, & that Mr 
Conrad left with his two daughters for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a>, & had invited them all 
to return with him, & remain at his house until all apprehension was over 
in the town & in the Barracks which they all declined as a matter of of 
cors alth I duly appreciate his kind invitation 
</p><p>
We have just received or rather receved a few days since across the 
country information that after the commissioners had failed to settle the 
difficulties existing between the two countries who were appointed by 
Gen Santa Anna to Mr Trist by negotiation, the armistice was broken off, 
on the 6 th ult & hostilities immediately commenced, & after some more 
hard fighting <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> entered the City of Mexico on the 14th  Santa 
Anna having fled with the remnant of his army; but what place he 
retreated to we have not heard ; nor have we learned any particulars 
touching the same. I was pleased to hear that Gen Smith & Col Riley 
distinguished themselves in the battles of the 19th  2o th of Aug c & no 
doubt done so likewise in the attack, which resulted in taking the city. I 
think Majr Sewel ought to be perfectly satisfied as well as Majr Raines, & 
all others who volunteered to leave the field, as those two gentlemen 
retired. I do not recollect that Majr Hawkins ever made any report ; 
if he did it was done such a way that no one could make anything out of 
it ; since the receipt of your letter I mentioned the subject to Majr Bliss, 
who recollects nothing about Hawkins report nor does he believe he ever 
made one ; & I well recollect I was very much at a loss for want of some 
data to base my recommendations on for Brevets for services at fort Brown ; 
Hawkins was not recommended by me for promotion of that kind ; S. & 
Jouett may console each other for their disappointments in that way ; they 
both have got as much as they were entitled to ; at any rate I shall give 
myself no concern in the matter 
</p><p>
Before this you must have all the particulars connected with the 
taking the City of Mexico, as we get all our official news from that quarter by the way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> In consequence of taking the capital, 
which from all we can learn here, is not likely to bring about a peace, I 
have applies by the mail which leaves with this, for permission to leave 
the country ; & under the expectation of its being granted, shall transfer 
my head quarters to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> early next month, & yet hope to join 
my family by the first of Dec r or soon after I regret your letters to 
John by being sent to Lock Port will fail to reach him before he sails for 
the Pacific as it will be a long time before he will here from home. It is 
possible yet something may turn up to prevent my returning to the U. 
States at the time calculated on, but hope not ; but I will do so the 
moment I can leave with propriety 
</p><p>
Jouett you say is engineering to go up to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> with the Q M. 
dep to bring down his family on a public steam Boat ; I hope the Q r M. 
there will not give into any such silly arrangement ; I could wish he & 
his family could be assigned to some other pleasant station while you & 
your family are at the city. But I hope you will as well as Ann act with 
great circumspection towards him, & his while you have to be associated 
with them, so far as to be at all times polite without being intimate. We 
can however talk those matters over as well as many others should we ever 
have the opportunity of again meeting which I hope will be the case 
before a great while, at our leisure. My love to Ann & the girls when 
you write them & wishing you & yours continued health & prosperity I 
remain

Truly Your 
Friend
