CAMP AT <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=steenropia" rel="city">Steenropia</a> 10th Sep'r <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>

Sir 
</p><p>
When your Excellency was pleased to lay a state of matters before the Council of War the 6th of June, the prospects were extremely flatter 
ing, we had great expectations from the promised succours by his most Christian Majesty as well as from the exertions of these States 
upon this ground I did myself the honor of giving an opinion to your Excellency in writing of what I then thought the most feasible & 
proper point of Co-operation, but the Intervention of a Superior fleet to that of our Allies in these seas the blockade of Brest in which 
port the second Division intended for America is shut up the tedious delay of Operation in the West Indies together with the Deficiency 
of promised aid Supplies in the United States, have materially altered the Complexion of Affairs 
</p><p>
from a comparative view of the strength of the Armies under the Immediate Command of your Excellency that of's r Henry Clinton, 
I find the numbers rather in favor of the Enemy, the recent Military check we reed in South Carolina has given Lord Cornwallis a decided 
Superiority in that Quarter, at Penobscut the enemy appear well Established & in Canada a Combined Operation can not take place until another season 
</p><p>
could any Period be fixed for the Arrival of a fleet either from Europe or the West Indies so as to give our Allies the Sovereignty of these Seas 
I should not be at a loss in giving an Opinion on this Occasion but as this is only Problematical or at most Eventual I must acknowledge 
that I see nothing but a choice of Difficulties left to Determine upon among others that of experiencing every extreme of Distress at this stage of 
the Campaign for want of Provisions is of the most Alarming Nature, would of itself be sufficient to defeat any the best plan in the power of a General to Devise 
</p><p>
In full confidence that Supplies of every kind will be more regular in future in the presumption that the french forces now at Rhode Island, are subject to your Excellency's 
Command I would advise you (in the absence of the British fleet) to order the troops to form a Junction with you the soonest possible, sending the 
Shipping round to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> Harbour where if I am rightly Informed they may ride secure and without danger of being attacked, as the Enemy 
dare not Detatch their fleet & Operating Land force to so great a Distance whilst your Excellency remains in the Vicinity of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> at the 
Head of a Combined & puissant Army ready to seize the first Opening to enter where the Enemy may be deemed most Vulnerable 
</p><p>
I also am lead to this Opinion on the eventual arrival of a Naval & perhaps Land force in time to Operate with effect against that place 
which will be much forwarded by these troops being near the point of Action a move of this nature will at all events leave it in your Excellency's power to make a Detatchment towards 
the Southward in some Degree adequate to the Magnitude of the Object, & yet be in a Condition to afford cover to the Country until the 
arrival of Re-enforcements from Europe or the West Indies which may give you an Opportunity to Operate either in this Quarter or at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charles Town</a> as Circumstances might then Offer, & if disappointed in this you l be able to maintain your Ground free from Insult until the States 
have time to recruit their Army for the War & to bring them into the field Properly appointed & duly rationed, which is the only measure that 
can save this Country from Impending ruin, the Junction of these troops will also afford a favorable opening for entering Canada by the 
Lake Champlain during the Winter, should the situation of Affairs render that an Adviseable Object, nor will the troops of france experience 
those Difficulties that we have been subject to, their hard Cash will always Command a Redundancy of every necessary in a Country, not so 
much exhausted with respect to Supplies, as in want of faith in our paper Currency 
</p><p>
I am further stimulated to this advice by the apparent preparation for an Embarkation of troops both horse & foot at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> which may 
give the wished for opening to Carry that City whilst the attention of's r Henry Clinton is drawn to some other Quarter on the presumption that 
your force will not be adequate to enterprise anything against that post at this late season, & 
that the french will remain in their present position nor shall I be disappointed if Adm 1 Arbouthnot with the bulk of his Fleet should favor 
the Operations of's 1 - Harry on the same ground, in full expectation of returning in time to prevent any serious Consequences taking place during a temporary Absence 
</p><p>
Upon the whole I am fully of Opinion that without a Change of Circumstances our present force is not adequate to act in an Open Offensive 
manner, yet by one of these Delicate eventual manoeuvres sometimes practiced we might cause the Enemy to Commit themselves in a point of which Advantage may be taken, & 
pushed with effect, but this is an Idea yet in embryo which when mature I shall do myself the honor of Communicating Viva Voce 
</p><p>
I also think that you can not make any considerable Detatchment until the Junction already mentioned takes place : or until the Enemy Detatch on their part, which may very soon be the 
case, & probably by that time we may have it in our power to proceed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charles Town</a>, by water an event devoutly to be wished as a March by land must naturally reduce the troops 
at least one third occasioned by Desertion sickness and other Casualties incident to all Armies during a tedious & Distant tour 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most Obt 
</p><p>
and very
