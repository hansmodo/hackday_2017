MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
<block>
" L AMBITION dans Poisivete, la bassesse dans Por- 
geuil, le desir de's enrichir sans travail, Paversion 
pour la verite, la flatterie, la trahison, la perfidie, 
Pabandon de tous ses engagemens, le mepris des de 
voirs du citoyen, la crainte de la vertu du prince, 
Pesperance de ses foiblesses, et plus que tout cela, le 
ridicule perpetuel jette sur la vertu, forment, je crois, 
le caractere du plus grand nombre des courtisans, 
marque dans tous les lieux et dans tous les temps."

It is Montesquieu who draws this picture, and I 
think it is drawn from the life, and is an exact resemblance. You cannot wonder, then, that I am weary, 
and wish to be at home upon almost any terms. 
Your life would be dismal in a high degree, you 
would be in a hideous solitude among millions. None 
of them would be society for you that you could endure. Mrs. Jay is in this situation, ardently longing to 
come home. Yet she is much better circumstanced 
than you are, to be abroad, as her family is smaller 
and younger. You must leave a part of your family. 
</p><p>
No. Let us live in our own country, and in our 
own way, educate our children to be good for some 
thing. Upon no consideration whatever would I have 
any of my children educated in Europe. In con 
science I could not consent to it. 
</p><p>
If Congress had been steady and continued in force 
my commission to make a treaty of commerce with 
Great Britain, I should have gone to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, and 
have finished the treaty before now ; but I should not 
have thought of residing in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> long. I should 
have resigned and returned to America in a year or 
two at farthest. If Congress should now revive my 
commission and send me a new one, which I think 
altogether improbable, but believe they will complete 
their work by sending another man upon that errand, 
I would not stay longer in England than a year or 
two at farthest. I cannot bear the thought of a long 
banishment from my own native soil where alone I 
can ever be happy or comfortable. 
</p><p>
I write you by every opportunity, lest you should 
embark for Europe when I am upon my passage 
home, which would be a terrible disappointment to 
both. My intention, is to come home, whether I receive the acceptance of my resignation or not, unless 
1 receive a commission to St. James's. Don t you 
embark, therefore, until you receive a letter from 
me desiring you to come. If I should receive such 
a commission, I will write you immediately by way 
of France, Holland and England, and shall wish you 
to come to me on the wings of the wind. But the 
same influence, French influence I mean, which induced Congress to revoke my commission, will still 
continue to prevent the revival of it. And I think it 
likely, too, that English influence will now be added to 
French, for I don t believe that George wishes to see 
my face. In this case I shall enjoy the satisfaction 
of coming, where I wish most to be, with all my 
children, living in simplicity, innocence and repose. 
</p><p>
What I write you upon this subject is in confidence, 
and must not be communicated but with great discretion. 
</p><p>
Yours entirely and forever, 
</p><p>
