That a dissolution of the union would be the consequence 
of a war with Great Britain, I think very probable ; but the 
dissolution of the union is perhaps rather a subject of hope 
than of fear, to those who are hurrying the nation to its 
disgrace and calamity. If there be a Frenchman who governs and conducts the party that now commands a majority, 
you may rest assured that neither he, nor those from whom 
he receives his impulse, have dispositions at all favorable to 
the American union.

My sentiments, I confess, are widely different. All my 
hopes of national felicity and glory have invariably been 
founded upon the continuance of the union. I have cherished these hopes with so much fondness, they have so long 
been incorporated into my ideas of public concern, that I 
cannot abandon them without a pang, as keen as that of a 
dissolving soul and body. Much as I must disapprove of the 
general tenor of southern politics I would rather even yield 
to their unreasonable pretensions and suffer much for their wrongs, than break the chain that binds us together. For 
there is no one article of my political creed more clearly 
demonstrated to my mind than this, that we shall proceed 
with gigantic strides to honor and consideration, and national greatness, if the union is preserved ; but that if it is 
once broken, we shall soon divide into a parcel of petty 
tribes at perpetual war with one another, swayed by rival 
European powers, whose policy will agree perfectly in the 
system of keeping us at variance with one another, and who 
will at the same time govern and despise the party they may 
respectively protect.
