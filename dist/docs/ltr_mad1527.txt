The Constitutions of the several States were printed in a 
small volume a year or two ago, by order of Congress. A perusal of them need not be recommended to you. Having but a 
single copy, I cannot supply you. It is not improbable that 
you may be already possessed of one. The revisal of our laws 
by Jefferson, Wythe, and Pendleton, beside their value in improving the legal code, may suggest something worthy of being 
attended to in framing a Constitution.

[Remarks on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>'s " Draught of a Constitution for Virginia,"* sent 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> to Mr. John Brown, Kentucky, October <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1788">1788</a> :] 
</p><p>
The term of two years is too short. Six years are not more than sufficient. A 
Senate is to withstand the occasional impetuosities of the more 
numerous branch. The members ought, therefore, to derive a 
firmness from the tenure of their places. It ought to supply 
the defect of knowledge and experience incident to the other 
branch; there ought to be time given, therefore, for attaining the 
qualifications necessary for that purpose. It ought, finally, to 
maintain that system and steadiness in public affairs without 
which no government can prosper or be respectable. This cannot be done by a body undergoing a frequent change of its members. A Senate for six years will not be dangerous to liberty; 
on the contrary, it will be one of its best guardians. By correcting the infirmities of popular government, it will prevent 
that disgust against that form which may otherwise produce a 
sudden transition to some very different one. It is no secret 
to any attentive and dispassionate observ. of the political situation of the United States, that the real danger to republican 
liberty has lurked in that cause. 
</p><p>
The appointment of Senators by districts seems to be objectionable. A spirit of locality is inseparable from that mode. 
The evil is fully displayed in the County representations, the 
members of which are everywhere observ. to lose sight of the 
aggregate interests of the community, and even to sacrifice them 
to the interests or prejudices of their respective constituents. 
In general, these local interests are miscalculated. But it is 
not impossible for a measure to be accommodated to the particular interests of every County or district, when considered by 
itself, and not so, when considered in relation to each other 
and to the whole State; in the same manner as the interests of 
individuals may be very different in a state of nature and in a 
political union. The most effectual remedy for the local bias 
is to impress on the minds of the Senators an attention to the 
interest of the whole society, by making them the choice of the 
whole Society, each citizen voting for every Senator. The objection here is, that the fittest characters would not be sufficiently 
known to the people at large. But, in free governments, merit 
and notoriety of character are rarely separated; and such a 
regulation would connect them more and more together. Should 
this mode of election be on the whole not approved, that established in Maryland presents a valuable alternative. The latter 
affords, perhaps, a greater security for the selection of merit. 
The inconveniences chargeable on it are two: first, that the 
Council of electors favors cabal. Against this, the shortness 
of its existence is a good antidote. Secondly, that in a large 
State the meeting of the electors must be expensive if they be 
paid, or badly attended if the serv.e is onerous. To this it 
may be answered that, in a case of such vast importance, the 
expense, which could not be great, ought to be disregarded. 
"Whichever of these modes may be preferred, it cannot be amiss 
so far to admit the plan of districts as to restrain the choice to 
persons residing in different parts of the State. Such a regulation will produce a diffusive confidence in the body, which is 
not less necessary than the other means of rendering it useful. 
In a State having large towns which can easily unite their 
votes, the precaution would be essential to an immediate choice 
by the people at large. In Maryland no regard is paid to residence, and, what is remarkable, vacancies are filled by the Senate itself. This last is an obnoxious expedient, and cannot in 
any point of view have much effect. It was probably meant to 
obviate the trouble of occasional meetings of the electors. But 
the purpose might have been otherwise answered by allowing 
the unsuccessful candidates to supply vacancies according to the 
order of their standing on the list of votes, or by requiring provisional appointments to be made along with the positive ones. 
If an election by districts be unavoidable, and the ideas here 
suggested be sound, the evil will be diminished in proportion 
to the extent given to the districts, taking two or more Senators from each district. 
</p><p>
The first question arising here is how far property ought to be made a qualification. There is a middle way to be taken, which corresponds at 
once with the theory of free government and the lessons of experience. A freehold or equivalent of a certain value may be 
annexed to the right of voting for Senators, and the right left 
more at large in the election of the other House. Examples of 
this distinction may be found in the Constitutions of several 
States, particularly, if I mistake not, of North Carolina and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. This middle mode reconciles and secures the two 
cardinal objects of government, the rights of persons and the 
rights of property. The former will be sufficiently guarded by 
one branch, the latter more particularly by the other. Give all 
power to property, and the indigent will be oppressed. Give it 
to the latter, and the effect may be transposed. Give a defensive share to each, and each will be secure. The necessity of 
thus guarding the rights of property was, for obvious reasons, 
unattended to in the commeneement of the Revolution. In all 
the governments which were considered as beacons to republican patriots and lawgivers, the rights of persons were subjected 
to those of property. The poor were sacrificed to the rich. In 
the existing state of American population and of American 
property, the two classes of rights were so little discriminated, 
that a provision for the rights of persons was supposed to include of itself those of property; and it was natural to infer, 
from the tendency of republican laws, that these different interests would be more and more identified. Experience and investigation have, however, produced more correct ideas on this 
subject. It is now observ. that in all populous countries the 
smaller part only can be interested in preserv.g the rights of 
property. It must be foreseen that America, and Kentucky itself, will by degrees arrive at this state of society; that in some 
parts of the Union a very great advance is already made towards it. It is well understood that interest leads to injustice, 
as well where the opportunity is presented to bodies of men as 
to individuals; to an interested majority in a Republic, as to 
the interested minority in any other form of government. The 
time to guard against this danger is at the first forming of the 
Constitution, and in the present state of population, when the 
bulk of the people have a sufficient interest in possession or in 
prospect to be attached to the rights of property, without being 
insufficiently attached to the rights of persons. Liberty, not 
less than justice, pleads for the policy here recommended. If 
all power be suffered to slide into hands not interested in the 
rights of property, which must be the case whenever a majority 
fall under that description, one of two things cannot fail to happen; either they will unite against the other description and 
become the dupes and instruments of ambition, or their poverty 
and dependence will render them the mercenary instruments of 
wealth. In either case liberty will be subverted: in the first, 
by a despotism growing out of anarchy; in the second, by an 
oligarchy founded on corruption. 
</p><p>
The second question under this head is, whether the ballot 
be not a better mode than that of voting viva voce. The comparative experience of the States pursuing the different modes 
is in favor of the first. It is found less difficult to guard against 
fraud in that than against bribery in the other. 
</p><p>
Does not the exclusion of Ministers of 
the Gospel, as such, violate a fundamental 
principle of liberty, by punishing a religious profession with the 
privation of a civil right? Does it not violate another article 
of the plan itself, which exempts religion from the cognizance 
of Civil power? Does it not violate justice, by at once taking 
away a right and prohibiting a compensation for it? Does it 
not, in fine, violate impartiality, by shutting the door against the 
Ministers of one religion and leaving it open for those of every 
other ? 
</p><p>
The re-eligibility of members after accepting offices of profit 
is so much opposed to the present way of thinking in America, 
that any discussion of the subject would probably be a waste of 
time. 
</p><p>
It is at least questionable whether death 
ought to be confined to treason and murder." It would not, therefore, be prudent to tie the hands of 
government in the manner here proposed. The prohibition of 
pardon, however specious in theory, would have practical consequences which render it inadmissible. A single instance is a 
sufficient proof. The crime of treason is generally shared by a 
number and often a very great number. It would be politically 
if not morally wrong to take away the lives of all, even if every 
individual were equally guilty. What name would be given to 
a severity which made no distinction between the legal and the 
moral offence; between the deluded multitude and their wicked 
leaders? A second trial would not avoid the difficulty; because 
the oaths of the jury would not permit them to hearken to any 
voice but the inexorable voice of the law. 
</p><p>
The power of the Legislature to appoint any other than their 
own officers departs too far from the theory which requires a 
separation of the great departments of government. One of the 
best securities against the creation of unnecessary offices or tyrannical powers is an exclusion of the authors from all share 
in filling the one, or influence in the execution of the other. 
The proper mode of appointing to offices will fall under another 
head. 
</p><p>
An election by the Legislature is liable 
</p><p>
Executive Governor. . , . . ' 
</p><p>
to insuperable objections. It not only 
tends to faction, intrigue, and corruption, but leaves the Executive under the influence of an improper obligation to that Department. An election by the people at large, as in this* and 
several other States, or by electors, as in the appointment of 
the Senate in Maryland, or, indeed, by the people, thro 7 any other 
channel than .their legislative representatives, seems to be far 
preferable. The ineligibility a second time, tho' not perhaps 
without advantages, is also liable to a variety of strong objections. It takes away one powerful motive to a faithful and 
useful administration, the desire of acquiring that title to a reappointment. By rendering a periodical change of men necessary, it discourages beneficial undertakings, which require perseverance and system, or, as frequently happened in the Roman 
Consulate, either precipitates or prevents the execution of them. 
It may inspire desperate enterprises for the attainment of what 
is not attainable by legitimate means. It fetters the judgment 
and inclination of the community; and in critical moments 
would either produce a violation of the Constitution or exclude 
a choice which might be essential to the public safety. Add to 
the whole, that by putting the Executive Magistrate in the situation of the tenant of an unrenewable lease, it would tempt 
him to neglect the constitutional rights of his department, and 
to connive at usurpations by the Legislative department, with 
which he may connect his future ambition or interest. 
</p><p>
The clause restraining the first magistrate from the immediate command of the military force would be made better by 
excepting cases in which he should receive the sanction of the 
two branches of the Legislature. 
</p><p>
The following variations are suggested : 
Council of State. 
</p><p>
1. Ihe election to be made by the people 
</p><p>
immediately, or thro' some other medium than the Legislature. 
</p><p>
2. A distributive choice should perhaps be secured, as in the 
case of the Senate. 3. Instead of an ineligibility a second 
time, a rotation in the Federal Senate, with an abridgment of 
the term, to be substituted. 
</p><p>
The appointment to offices is, of all the functions of Republican, and perhaps every other form of government, the most difficult to guard against abuse. Give it to a numerous body, and 
you at once destroy all responsibility, and create a perpetual 
source of faction and corruption. Give it to the Executive 
wholly, and it may be made an engine of improper influence and 
favoritism. Suppose the power were divided thus : let the Executive alone make all the subordinate appointments, and the 
Governor and Senate, as in the Federal Constitution, those of 
the superior order. It seems particularly fit that the Judges, 
who are to form a distinct department, should owe their offices 
partly to each of the other departments, rather than wholly to 
either. 
</p><p>
Much detail ought to be avoided in the Constitutional regulation of this Department, that there may be room for changes which may be 
demanded by the progressive changes in the state of our population. It is at least doubtful whether the number of courts, the 
number of Judges, or even the boundaries of jurisdiction, ought 
to be made unalterable but by a revisal of the Constitution. 
The precaution seems no otherwise necessary than as it may 
prevent sudden modifications of the establishment, or addition 
of obsequious judges, for the purpose of evading the checks of 
the Constitution and giving effect to some sinister policy of the 
Legislature. But might not the same object be otherwise attained? by prohibiting, for example, any innovations in those 
particulars without the consent of that department? or without 
the annual sanction of two or three successive Assemblies, over 
and above the other pre-requisites to the passage of a law ? 
</p><p>
The model here proposed for a Court of Appeals is not recommended by experience. It is found, as might well be presumed, that the members are always warped in their appellate 
decisions by an attachment to the principles and jurisdiction of 
their respective Courts, and still more so by the previous decision on the case removed by appeal. The only efficient cure 
for the evil is to form a Court of Appeals of distinct and select 
Judges. The expense ought not to be admitted as an objection : 
1. Because the proper administration of justice is of too essential a nature to be sacrificed to that consideration. 2. The 
number of inferior judges might, in that case, be lessened. 3. 
The whole department may be made to support itself by a judicious tax on law proceedings. 
</p><p>
The excuse for non-attendance would be a more proper subject of enquiry somewhere else than in the Court to which the 
party belonged. Delicacy, mutual convenience, &c., would soon 
reduce the regulation to mere form; or if not, it might become 
a disagreeable source of little irritations among the members. 
A certificate from the local Court, or some other local authority, where the party might reside or happen to be detained from 
his duty, expressing the cause of absence, as well as that it was 
judged to be satisfactory, might be safely substituted. Few 
Judges would improperly claim their wages if such a formality 
stood in the way. These observ.ions are applicable to the 
Council of State. 
</p><p>
A Court of Impeachment is among the most puzzling articles 
of a Republican Constitution; and it is far more easy to point 
out defects in any plan than to supply a cure for them. The 
diversified expedients adopted in the Constitutions of the several States prove how much the compilers were embarrassed on 
this subject. The plan here proposed varies from all of them, 
and is, perhaps, not less than any, a proof of the difficulties 
which pressed the ingenuity of its author. The remarks arising 
on it are: 1. That it seems not to square with reason that the 
right to impeach should be united to that of trying the impeachment, and consequently, in a proportional degree, to that of 
sharing in the appointment of or influence on the Tribunal to 
which the trial may belong. 2. As the Executive and Judiciary would form a majority of the Court, and either have a 
right to impeach, too much might depend on a combination of 
these departments. This objection would be still stronger if 
the members of the Assembly were capable, as proposed, of 
holding offices, and were amenable in that capacity to the 
Court. 3. The House of Delegates and either of those departments could appoint a majority of the Court. Here is another 
danger of combination, and the more to be apprehended, as that 
branch of the Legislature would also have the right to impeach, 
a right in their hands of itself sufficiently weighty; and as the 
power of the Court would extend to the head of the Executive, 
by whose independence the constitutional rights of that Department are to be secured against legislative usurpations. 4. The 
dangers in the two last cases would be still more formidable, 
as the power extends not only to deprivation, but to future incapacity of office. In the case of all officers of sufficient importance to be objects of factious persecution, the latter branch of 
power is, in every view, of a delicate nature. In that of the 
Chief Magistrate, it seems inadmissible if he be chosen by the 
Legislature, and much more so if immediately by the people 
themselves. A temporary incapacitation is the most that could 
be properly authorised. 
</p><p>
The two great desiderata in a Court of Impeachments are: 
1. Impartiality. 2. Respectability; the first in order to a right, 
the second in order to a satisfactory decision. These characteristics are aimed at in the following modification: Let the Senate be denied the right to impeach. Let one-third of the members be struck out, by alternate nominations of the prosecutors 
and party impeached; the remaining two-thirds to be the stamen 
of the Court. When the House of Delegates impeach, let the 
Judges, or a certain proportion of them, and the Council of 
State, be associated in the trial; when the Governor or Council 
impeaches, let the Judges only be associated; when the Judges 
impeach, let the Council only be associated. But if the party 
impeached by the House of Delegates be a member of the Executive or Judiciary, let that of which he is a member not 
be associated. If the party impeached belong to one and 
be impeached by the other of these branches, let neither of 
them be associated, the decision being in this case left with the 
Senate alone; or if that be thought exceptionable, a few members might be added by the House of Delegates. Two-thirds 
of the Court should in all cases be necessary to a conviction, 
and the- Chief Magistrate, at least, should be exempt from a sentence of perpetual, if not of temporary incapacity. It is extremely probable that a critical discussion of this outline may 
discover objections which do not occur. Some do occur; but 
appear not to be greater than are incident to any different modification of the Tribunal. 
</p><p>
The establishment of trials by jury and viva voce testimony, 
in all cases and in all Courts, is, to say the least, a delicate experiment; and would most probably be either violated, or be 
found inconvenient. 
</p><p>
A revisionary power is meant as a check 
</p><p>
Council of Revision. . 
</p><p>
to precipitate, to unjust, and to unconstitutional laws. These important ends would, it is conceded, be 
more effectually secured, without disarming the Legislature of 
its requisite authority, by requiring bills to be separately communicated to the Executive and Judiciary departments. If 
either of these object, let two-thirds, if both, three-fourths, of 
each House be necessary to overrule the objection ; and if either 
or both protest against a bill as violating the Constitution, let 
it moreover be suspended, notwithstanding the overruling proportion of the Assembly, until there shall have been a subsequent election of the House of Delegates and a re-passage of 
the bill by two-thirds or three-fourths of both houses, as the case 
may be. It should not be allowed the Judges or the Executive 
to pronounce a law thus enacted unconstitutional and invalid. 
</p><p>
In the State Constitutions, and, indeed, in the Federal one 
also, no provision is made for the case of a disagreement in expounding them; and as the Courts are generally the last in 
making the decision, it results to them, by refusing or not refusing to execute a law, to stamp it with its final character. 
This makes the Judiciary department paramount in fact to the 
Legislature, which was never intended and can never be proper. 
</p><p>
The extension of the Habeas Corpus to the cases in which it 
has been usually suspended merits consideration at least. If 
there be emergencies which call for such a suspension, it can 
have no effect to prohibit it, because the prohibition will assuredly give way to the impulse of the moment; or rather, it 
will have the bad effect of facilitating other violations that may 
be less necessary. The exemption of the press from liability in 
every case for true facts is also an innovation, and, as such, 
ought to be well considered. This essential branch of liberty 
is, perhaps, in more danger of being interrupted by local tumults, 
or the silent awe of a predominant party, than by any direct 
attacks of power.
