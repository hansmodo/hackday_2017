Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I doubt if you can do much this session in the way of 
financial legislation, and I hope Congress, on reorganizing 
after March 4, will follow the old custom of not doing 
anything till winter. I doubt if as much good will result 
from debates, as from observing the working of the 
present system of finance and reconstruction. Next 
winter you will have the advantage of the experience 
meanwhile, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> will be there, fairly installed, and 
better prepared to execute what is found to be best. If 
ever a country was too much governed, ours is. Congress ought to set the example of short sessions. 
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
