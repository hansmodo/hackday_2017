DEAR MADAM : Kind Providence preserved me and all with me safe to our home in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hanover" rel="city">Hanover</a>. Here people have been very sickly, but hope the 
sickly season is nigh over. My dear Annie has been ailing two or three days with a fever. The dear children are very well. My son <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pah" rel="son met">Patrick</a> has 
gone to Philadelphia near seven weeks. The affairs are kept with great secrecy, nobody being allowed 
to be present. I assure you we have our lowland troubles and fears with respect to Great Britain. 
Perhaps our good God may bring us out of these many evils, which threaten us not only from the 
mountains but from the seas. I can not forget to thank my dear Mrs. Fleming for the great kindness that you showed us in Botetourt, and assure 
you that I remember Colonel Fleming and you with much esteem and best wishes, and shall take it very kind if you will let me hear from you. 
</p><p>
My daughter Betty joins me in kind love to yourself and Miss Rosie, and especially to your dear good mother when you see her. 
</p><p>
I am, dear madam, your humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=swh" rel="me">SARAH HENRY</a>.
