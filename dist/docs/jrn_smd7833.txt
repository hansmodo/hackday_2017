"Any more, <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Mr. Lincoln</a>, any more?" can't you leave our racked homes in repose? We are all wild. 
Last night, five citizens were arrested, on no charge at all, and carried down to Picayune Butler's ship. 
What a thrill of terror ran through the whole community! We all felt so helpless, so powerless under 
the hand of our tyrant, the man who swore to uphold the Constitution and the laws, who is professedly 
only fighting to give us all Liberty, the birthright 
of every American, and who, nevertheless, has ground 
us down to a state where we would not reduce our 
negroes, who tortures and sneers at us, and rules us 
with an iron hand ! Ah ! Liberty ! what a humbug ! I 
would rather belong to England or France, than to 
the North! Bondage, woman that I am, I can never 
stand ! Even now, the Northern papers, distributed 
among us, taunt us with our subjection and tell us 
"how coolly Butler will grind them down, paying no 
regard to their writhing and torture beyond tightening the bonds still more ! Ah, truly ! this is the bitterness of slavery, to be insulted and reviled by cowards 
who are safe at home and enjoy the protection of 
the laws, while we, captive and overpowered, dare 
not raise our voices to throw back the insult, and are 
governed by the despotism of one man, whose word 
is our law! And that man, they tell us, "is the right 
man in the right place. He will develop a Union 
sentiment among the people, if the thing can be 
done ! " Come and see if he can ! Hear the curse that 
arises from thousands of hearts at that man's name, 
and say if he will "speedily bring us to our senses." 
Will he accomplish it by love, tenderness, mercy, 
compassion? He might have done it; but did he 
try? When he came, he assumed his natural r61e as 
tyrant, and bravely has he acted it through, never 
once turning aside for Justice or Mercy. . . . This 
degradation is worse than the bitterness of death! 
I see no salvation on either side. No glory awaits 
the Southern Confederacy, even if it does achieve its 
independence; it will be a mere speck in the world, 
with no weight or authority. The North confesses 
itself lost without us, and has paid an unheard-of 
ransom to regain us. On the other hand, conquered, 
what hope is there in this world for us? Broken in 
health and fortune, reviled, contemned, abused by 
those who claim already to have subdued us, without 
a prospect of future support for those few of our 
brothers who return; outcasts without home or 
honor, would not death or exile be preferable? Oh, 
let us abandon our loved home to these implacable 
enemies, and find refuge elsewhere! Take from us 
property, everything, only grant us liberty! Is this 
rather frantic, considering I abhor politics, and 
women who meddle with them, above all? My 
opinion has not yet changed ; I still feel the same contempt for a woman who would talk at the top of her 
voice for the edification of Federal officers, as though 
anxious to receive an invitation requesting her presence at the Garrison. " I can suffer and be still" as 
far as outward signs are concerned ; but as no word 
of this has passed my lips, I give it vent in writing, 
which is more lasting than words, partly to relieve 
my heart, partly to prove to my own satisfaction 
that I am no coward ; for one line of this, surrounded 
as we are by soldiers, and liable to have our houses 
searched at any instant, would be a sufficient indictment for high treason. 
</p><p>
Under General Williams's rule, I was perfectly 
satisfied that whatever was done, was done through 
necessity, and under orders from Headquarters, 
beyond his control ; we all liked him. But now, since 
Butler's arrival, I believe I am as frantic in secret 
as the others are openly. I know that war sanctions 
many hard things, and that both sides practice 
them; but now we are so completely lost in Lousiana, is it fair to gibe and taunt us with our humiliation? I could stand anything save the cowardly 
ridicule and triumph of their papers. Honestly, I 
believe if all vile abusive papers on both sides were 
suppressed, and some of the fire-eating editors who 
make a living by lying were soundly cowhided or had 
their ears clipped, it would do more towards establishing peace, than all the bloodshedding either side 
can afford. I hope to live to see it, too. Seems to 
me, more liberty is allowed to the press than would 
be tolerated in speech. Let us speak as freely as any 
paper, and see if to-morrow we do not sleep at Fort Jackson ! 
</p><p>
This morning the excitement is rare ; fifteen more 
citizens were arrested and carried off, and all the rest 
grew wild with expectation. So great a martyrdom 
is it considered, that I am sure those who are not arrested will be woefully disappointed. It is ludicrous 
to see how each man thinks he is the very one they 
are in search of! We asked a twopenny lawyer, of 
no more importance in the community than Dophy 
is, if it was possible he was not arrested. " But I am 
expecting to be every instant ! " So much for his self-assurance ! Those arrested have, some, been quietly 
released (those are so smiling and mysterious that I 
suspect them), some been obliged to take the oath, 
some sent to Fort Jackson. Ah, Liberty! What a 
blessing it is to enjoy thy privileges ! If some of these 
poor men are not taken prisoners, they will die of 
mortification at the slight.

Our valiant Governor, the brave Moore, has by 
order of the real Governor, Moise, made himself 
visible at some far-distant point, and issued a proclamation, saying, whereas we of <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> were 
held forcibly in town, he therefore considered men, 
women, and children prisoners of war, and as such 
the Yankees are bound to supply us with all necessaries, and consequently any one sending us aid or 
comfort or provisions from the country will be severely punished. Only Moore is fool enough for such 
an order. Held down by the Federals, our paper 
money so much trash, with hardly any other to buy 
food and no way of earning it; threatened with 
starvation and utter ruin, our own friends, by way of 
making our burden lighter, forbid our receiving the 
means of prolonging life, and after generously warning us to leave town, which they know is perfectly 
impossible, prepare to burn it over our heads, and 
let the women run the same risk as the men. Penned 
in on one little square mile, here we await our fate 
like sheep in the slaughter-pen. Our hour may be at 
hand now, it may be to-night; we have only to wait; 
the booming of the cannon will announce it to us 
soon enough.

Of the six sentenced to Fort Jackson, one is the 
Methodist minister, Mr. Craven. The only charge 
is, that he was heard to pray for the Confederate 
States by some officers who passed his house during 
his family prayers. According to that, which of us 
would escape unhung? I do not believe there is 
a woman in the land who closes her eyes before 
praying for God's blessing on the side on which her 
brothers are engaged. Are we all to cease? Show me 
the dungeon deep enough to keep me from praying 
for them ! The man represented that he had a large 
family totally dependent on him, who must starve. 
"Let them get up a subscription," was General Butler's humane answer. "I will head it myself." It is 
useless to say the generous offer was declined.
