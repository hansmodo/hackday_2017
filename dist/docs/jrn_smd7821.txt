Last night I determined to stay. Miriam went 
after our trunks at daylight. A few hours after, 
Lilly wrote we must go back. <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan's</a> army 
was cut to pieces and driven back to Maryland, 
by Jackson; the Federals were being driven into 
the swamp from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, too. <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel=''>Beauregard</a> is undoubtedly coming to attack <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>; his fire 
would burn the town, if the gunboats do not; the 
Yankees will shell, at all events, if forced to retire. 
It cannot stand. We can't go to <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>. Butler 
says he will lay it in ashes if he is forced to evacuate 
it, from yellow fever or other causes. Both must be 
burned. Green well is not worth the powder it would 
cost, so we must stand the chance of murder and 
starvation there, rather than the certainty of being 
placed between two fires here. Well, I see nothing 
but bloodshed and beggary staring us in the face. 
Let it come. "I hope to die shouting, the Lord will provide."
