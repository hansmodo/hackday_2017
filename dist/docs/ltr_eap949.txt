My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--The mail leaves New York the 14th and I flatter myself that you would be disappointed if you did not receive a letter from me. You speak of having left your trunk at Stockton in care of a gentleman who promised to send it to you. From the account that I have had of the Californians, it appears to me I would be afraid to trust any of them. Although I expect there are some good men there, who have gone out like yourself to try to make a fortune in a short time.
</p><p>
You must have a very contented disposition to be happy, for I am sure you have none of the comforts of life. You cannot imagine, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, how exceedingly anxious I am to see you. I was in hopes you had made up your mind to return home this fall. A year seems a long while to look forward to, and I feel as if it could not pass as swiftly as it has, but time flies though
we know not where. You have had all sorts of hard-ships and privations to endure this year, while I have had nothing but your absence.
</p><p>
I am delighted that you have quit digging the earth for what you could not find, and have taken surer means of making a living. If you can make enough to bring you back, it is all I ask, I assure you. Although I would have no objections to your returning with your pockets full of gold.

We received a letter from Theodore. He had left Georgetown and gone to a place called Spanish Bar. He was well, and expected to leave California in November next. He said he had made plum pies the day before he wrote, and they could not be beaten in the United States, for the dirt and the tobacco juice gave them a rich flavor. He says he received the letters you took out, one year after date. He says he has an appetite like a threshing machine. He had an ounce of gold stolen out of his tent. He knew who took it, but as he was a hard case, he thought he had better say nothing about it.

Mr. Dixon has quit gold digging and keeps a register's office. Every one that goes to the mines records his name and pays fifty cents, and every one that wants to see who is at the mines pays twenty-five cents for a search. His wife is getting along gaily. She is as cheerful as a lark.
</p><p>
I am very well now, but a while before I received your last letter I felt miserably and I felt weak. But when I heard such cheering news, I tell you there was a great change.

They are doing the first five miles of the Plank Road between West Chester and Philadelphia over the Schuylkill. The fever is high for the direct railroad.
</p><p>
They have had the books open in West Chester and sold seventy thousand dollars' worth of stock.

Jenny Lind arrived in New York last week, which produced quite an excitement. She will visit Philadelphia in a short time. The lowest price of tickets for her concerts is $8.00, from that up to $10.
</p><p>
I must now close, by wishing you health, prosperity and speedy return. My motto is, “Absent, but never to be forgotten.” I remain as ever yours,
</p><p>
E. APPLE.
