PLATTE RIVER, JUST ABOVE THE FORKS.

DEAR SISTER HARRIET AND BROTHER EDWARD. We have just encamped for the night near the bluffs over against the river. The bottoms are a soft, wet plain, and we were obliged to leave the river yesterday morning for the bluffs. The face of the country yesterday afternoon and to day has been rolling sand bluffs, mostly barren quite unlike what our eyes have been satiated with for weeks past. No timber nearer than the Platte, and the water to night is very bad, got from a small ravine. We have usually had good water previous to this.
</p><p>
Our fuel for cooking since we left timber (no timber except on rivers) has been dried buffalo dung. We now find plenty of it and it answers a very good purpose, similar to the kind of coal used in Pennsylvania. (I suppose Harriet will make up a face at this, but if she was here she would be glad to have her supper cooked at any
 rate, in this scarce timber country.) The present time in our journey is a very important one. The hunter brought us buffalo meat yesterday, for the first that has been seen to day to have been taken. We have some for supper to night. Husband is cooking it, no one of our company professes the art but himself. I expect it will be very good.
</p><p>
Stop -- I have so much to say to your children, that I do not know in what part of my story to begin. I have very little time to write. I will first tell you what our company consists of. We are ten in number, five missionaries, three Indian boys and two young men employed to assist in packing animals.
</p><p>
SAT. 4. Good morn H. & E. I wrote last night till supper, after that it was so dark I could not see. I told you how many bipeds there was in our company last night, now for the quadrupeds, -- 14 horses and six mules and fifteen head of cattle. We milk four cows. We started with seventeeen but we have killed one calf and the Fur Company being out of provisions have taken one of our cows for beaf. It is usually pinching times with the company before they reach the buffalo. We have had a plenty because we made ample provision at Liberty. We purchased a barrel of flour and baked enough to last us with killing a calf or two untill we reached the buffalo.
</p><p>
The Fur Com. is large this year. We are really a moving village -nearly four hundred animals with ours, mostly mules and seventy men. The Fur Com. has seven wagons and one cart, drawn by six mules each, heavily loaded; the cart drawn by two mules carries a lame man, one of the proprieters of the Com. We have two waggons in our com[pany.] Mr. & Mrs. S. and Husband and myself ride in one, Mr. Gray and the baggage in the other. Our Indian boys drive the cows and Duhn the horses. Young Miles leads our forward horses, four in each team. Now E. if you wish to see the camp in motion, look away ahead and see first the pilot and the Captain Fitzpatrick, just before him -- next the pack animals, all mules loaded with great packs -- soon after you will see the waggons and in the rear our company. We all cover quite a space. The pack mules always string along one after the other just like Indians. There are several gentlemen in the Com. who are going over the Mountains for pleasure. Capt. Stewart, Mr. Lee speaks of him in his journal -- he went over when he [Mr. Lee] did and returned. He is an Englishman, -- Mr. Chelam. We had a few of
 them to tea with us last Monday eve -- Capts. Fitzpatrick, Stuart, Maj. Harris and Chelam.

I wish I could discribe to you how we live so that you can realize it. Our manner of living is far preferable to any in the States. I never was so contented and happy before. Neither have I enjoyed such health for years. In the morn as soon as the day breaks the first that we hear is the word -- arise, arise. Then the mules set up such noise as you never heard which puts the whole camp in motion. We encamp in a large ring baggage and men, tents and waggons on the outside and all the animals, except the cows [which] are fastened to pickets, within the circle. This arrangement is to accommodate the guard who stand regularly every night and day, also when we are in motion, to protect our animals from the approach of Indians who would steal them. As I said the mule's noise brings every man on his feet to loose them and turn them out to feed.
</p><p>
Now H. & E. you must think it very hard to have to get up so early after sleeping on the soft ground. When you find it hard work to open your eyes at seven o'clock, just think of me, every morn at the word "Arise," we all spring. While the horses are feeding, we get our breakfast in a hurry and eat it. By this time the word "Catch up, catch up," rings throu the camp for moving. We are ready to start usually at six -travell till eleven, encamp, rest and feed, start again about two -- travel until six or before if we come to a good tavern -- then encamp for the night.

Since we have been in the prairie, we have done all our cooking. When we left Liberty we expected to take bread to last us part of the way but could not get enough to carry us any distance. We found it awkward work to bake at first out of doors, but we have become so accustomed to [it] now we do it very easy.
</p><p>
Tell Mother I am a very good housekeeper in the prairie. I wish she could just take a peep at us while we are sitting at our meals. Our table is the ground, our table-cloth is an Indian rubber cloth used when
it rains as a cloak; our dishes are made of tin -- basins for tea cups, iron spoons and plates, each of us, and several pans for milk and to put our meat in when we wish to set it upon the table -- each one carries his own knife in his scabboard and it is always ready for use. When the table things [are] spread, after making our forks of sticks and helping ourselves to chairs, we gather around the table. Husband always provides my seat and in a way that you would laugh to see us. It is the fashion of all this country to imitate the Turks.
</p><p>
Mr. Dunbar and Allis have supped with us and they do the same.  We take a blanket and lay down by the table and those whose joints will let them follow the fashion. Others take out some of the baggage (I suppose you know that there is no [stone] in this country. Not a stone have I seen of any size on the prairie.) For my part I fix myself as comfortably as I can, sometimes on a blanket, sometimes on a box, just as it is convenient. Let me assure you of this, we relish our food none the less for sitting on the ground while eating. We have tea and a plenty of milk which is a luxury in this country. Our milk has assisted us very much in making our bread since we have been journeying. While the fur company has felt the want of food, our milk has been of great service to us, but was considerable work to supply ten persons with bread three times a day. We are done using it now. What little flour we have left we we shall preserve for thickening our broth, which is excellent. I never saw anything like buffalo meat to satisfy hunger. We do not want any thing else with it. I have eaten three meals of it and it relishes well. Supper and breakfast we eat in our tent. We do not pitch it at noon. Have worship immediately after sup & breakfast.
</p><p>
NOON The face of the country to day has been like that of yesterday. We are now about 30 miles above the forks and leaving the bluffs for the river. We have seen wonders this forenoon. Herds of buffalo have hove in sight. One, a bull, crossed our trail and ran upon the bluffs near the rear of the camp. We took the trouble to chase him so as to have a near view. Sister Spaulding and myself got out of the waggon and ran upon the bluff to see him.  Husband was quite willing to gratify our curiosity since it was the first. Several have been killed this forenoon. The Company keep a man out all the time to hunt for the camp.
Edward, if I write much more in this way, I do not know as you can read it without great difficulty.   I could tell you much more but we are all ready to move again. So farewell for the present. I wish you were all here with us going to the dear Indians. I have become very much attached to Richard Takaktooahtis. It is the one you saw at our wedding. He calls me Mother. I love to teach him, to take care of him and hear them talk. There are five Nez Perces in the company and when they are together they chatter freely. Samuel Temoni, he would be the oldest one, has just come in to the camp with the skin and some of the meat of a buffalo which he has killed himself. He started this forenoon of his own accord. It is what they like dearly, to hunt buffalo. So long as we have him with us we shall be supplied with meat.
</p><p>
I am writing backwards. Monday morn[ing.] I began to say something here that I could not finish. Now the man from the mountains has come who will take this to the [post] office. I have commenced one to Sister Hull which should like to send this time if I could finish it. We have just met him and we have stopped our waggons to write a little. Give my love to all. I have not told you half I want to. We are all in health this morn and making rappid progress in our journey. By the fourth of July our Capt. intends to be at the place where Mr. Parker and husband parted last fall. We are a month earlier passing here than they were last spring. Husband has begun a letter to pa and ma and since he has cut his finger so that it troubles him to write to the rest.  As this is done in a hurry, I dont know as you can read it. Tell mother if I had looked the world over I could not have found one more careful and better qualified to transport a female such a distance.
</p><p>
Farewell all. Husband says "Stop." <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=nap" rel="me">NARCISSA PRENTISS</a>.
