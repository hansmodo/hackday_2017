LOUISIANA STATE SEMINARY, May 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1866">1866</a>. 
</p><p>
GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN, 
</p><p>
United States America. 
</p><p>
Dear General : Your most welcome favor of 12 ult. is 
at hand. 
</p><p>
I am glad to know that you still feel so much interest 
in the seminary as to use your valuable time in writing 
me such wholesome advice regarding its management. 
None can appreciate your suggestions more than I do ; 
for them I thank you, both in my official capacity and 
personally ; and for the personal interest which I know 
you have always taken in my welfare I tender you my most 
sincere thanks. In the late war through which the country has passed, I was opposed to you; and in my own 
feeble and humble way did my best to help secure the 
secession of the Southern States. 
</p><p>
For you, the great Federal Commander, I feel as do 
all good Southerners, not amiably, nor yet unkindly; 
for the noble and brilliant manner in which you did your 
duty commands our admiration, and now the struggle is 
over and I am one of the poor, subjugated band, I can 
truly say that I have not a particle of ill feeling towards 
any man in the Federal Army. On the contrary, I have 
a few friends whom I value none the less for whipping 
me. Understand me rightly. I speak with no cringing 
spirit. Though beaten and so poor that none do me 
reverence, I am patient and proud. The end of matters 
has decided that the rights I battled for were in vain. 
I have no other, and none will I ask. I have taken the 
oath of allegiance in good faith, hoping to be allowed to 
remain in the country, and if not a useful citizen to be 
a harmless one. 
</p><p>
Certainly I have no intention of ever again attempting 
to say who shall not be President of the United States. 
I am cured of that. That question must hereafter be 
decided by the faithful and not the rebellious. 
</p><p>
For a similar reason I am addressing these lines not 
to the General, but to W. T. Sherman, and I congratulate myself that no one knows the difference between 
the two characters better than my friend, the report of 
whose death at Shiloh gave me great grief, when I was 
a poor rebel soldier lying in the Rappahannock mud, and 
whose "Union Scouts" (alias Confederate jayhawkers 
and deserters) two years after kidnapped me and took 
me a prisoner to him at Natchez, where he treated me 
both like a prisoner of war and his personal friend! 
And the friendship of such a man I value, and hope 
ever to have his confidence and esteem. . . . 
</p><p>
Your chair is filled by Venable, Kirby Smith's topographical engineer. He has extraordinary capacity and 
fine character. . . . 
</p><p>
In one way you can be of great use to the seminary, 
and I claim the right to call your attention to the matter. 
Although I have bought some few books for the boys to 
read we are still in great need of a library, and as I 
have no doubt that you are showered with patent office 
reports, military books, maps, etc., much of which you 
do not want. Please have your orderly to pack up the 
rubbish and send them to us by Adams' express, I to 
pay all charges. If not in all, at least in the more important books, put your name as donor. I would like, 
also, to have a large picture of you in citizen's dress (unless you prefer your uniform), to be put in our library as 
our first superintendent. By sending us the books as 
asked for, you can really do us great good. You must 
know that we outsiders (not being represented at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>) can't even get a patent office report. . . . 
</p><p>
I must beg pardon for asking you to read so long a 
letter, but really, when I sit down to write to you, the 
past, so pleasant to recollect, and the present, so changed 
from then, make me feel like telling you all I know, 
and think, and feel. To a Southern man a conscientious Calhounite as I was and am the present is dark 
and sad, and the future gives but little hope. It is all 
not your fault nor mine. Present me most kindly to 
Mrs. Sherman and your children. 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
D. F. BOYD.
