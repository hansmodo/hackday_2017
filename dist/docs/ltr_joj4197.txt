My good Friend. 
</p><p>
In my letter to you of the 16th October Inst, I hinted that 
I might perhaps write and send you a few more lines on 
the question, Whether war of every description is forbidden 
by the gospel? 
</p><p>
I will now add some remarks to those which were inserted in my answer to your first letter. In that answer, 
the lawfulness of Mar, in certain cases, was inferred from 
those divine positive institutions which authorized and regulated it. For although those institutions were not dictated 
by the moral law, yet they eannot be understood to authorize what the moral law forbids. 
</p><p>
The moral or natural law was given by the Sovereign of 
the universe to all mankind ; with them it was coeval, and 
with them it will be coexistent. Being founded by infinite 
wisdom and goodness on essential right, which never varies, 
it can require no amendment nor alteration. 
</p><p>
Divine positive ordinances and institutions, on the other 
hand, being founded on expediency, which is not always 
perpetual or immutable, admit of, and have received, alteration and limitation in sundry instances. 
</p><p>
There were several divine positive ordinances and institutions at very early periods. Some of them were of limited obligation, as circumcision ; others of them were of 
universal obligation, as the Sabbath, marriage, sacrifices, 
the particular punishment for murder. 
</p><p>
The Lord of the Sabbath caused the day to be changed. 
The ordinances of Moses suffered the Israelites to exercise 
more than the original liberty allowed to marriage, but our 
Saviour repealed that indulgence. When sacrifices had 
answered their purpose as types of the greal Sacrifice, &c, 
they ceased. The punishment for murder has undergone 
no alteration, either by Moses or by Christ. 
</p><p>
I advert to this distinction between the moral law and 
positive institutions, because it enables us to distinguish 
the reasonings which apply to the one, from those which 
apply only to the other — ordinances being mutable, but the 
moral law always the same. 
</p><p>
To this you observe, by way of objection, that the law 
was given by Moses, but that grace and truth came by 
Jesus Christ ; and hence that even as it relates to the moral 
law, a more perfect system is enjoined by the gospel than 
was required under the law ; which admitted of an eye for 
an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, tolerating a spirit of retaliation. And further, that if the moral law was the same 
now that it was before the flood, we must call in question 
those precepts of the gospel which prohibit some things 
allowed of, and practised by the patriarchs. 
</p><p>
It is true that the law was given by Moses, not however 
in his individual or private capacity, but as the agent or 
instrument, and by the authority of the Almighty. The 
law demanded exact obedience, and proclaimed, " Cursed is 
every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them." The law was 
inexorable, and by requiring perfect obedience, under a 
penalty so inevitable and dreadful, operated as a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ for mercy. 
</p><p>
Mercy, and grace, and favour did come by Jesus Christ ; 
and also that truth which verified the promises and predictions concerning him, and which exposed and corrected the 
various errors which had been imbibed respecting the 
Supreme Being, his attributes, laws, and dispensations. 
Uninspired commentators have dishonoured the law, by 
ascribing to it, in certain cases, a sense and meaning which 
it did not authorize, and which our Saviour rejected and 
reproved. 
</p><p>
The inspired prophets, on the contrary, express the most 
exalted ideas of the law. They declare that the law of the 
Lord is perfect ; that the statutes of the Lord are right ; 
and that the commandment of the Lord is pure ; that God 
would magnify the law, and make it honourable, &zc. 
</p><p>
Our Saviour himself assures us, that he came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfil. That who 
</p><p>
shall do and teach the commandments, shall be called great 
in the kingdom of heaven : that it is easier for heaven and 
earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. This certainly amounts to a full approbation of it. Even after the 
resurrection of our Lord, and after the descent of the Holy 
Spirit, and after the miraculous conversion of Paul, and 
after the direct revelation of the Christian dispensation to 
him, he pronounced this memorable encomium on the law, 
viz : " The law is holy, and the commandments holy, just, 
and good" 
</p><p>
It is true that one of the positive ordinances of Moses, to 
which you allude, did ordain retaliation, or in other words, 
a tooth for a tooth. But we are to recollect that it was 
ordained, not as a rule to regulate the conduct of private 
individuals towards each other, but as a legal penalty or 
punishment for certain offences. Retaliation is also manifest in the punishment prescribed for murder — life for life. 
Legal punishments are adjudged and inflicted by the law 
and magistrate, and not by unauthorized individuals. These 
and all other positive laws or ordinances established by 
Divine direction, must of necessity be consistent with the 
moral law. It certainly was not the design of the law or 
ordinance in question, to encourage a spirit of personal or 
private revenge. On the contrary, there are express injunctions in the law of Moses, which inculcate a very different 
spirit; such as these: "Thou shalt not avenge, nor hear 
any grudge against the children of thy people ; but thou 
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." " Love the stran 
for ye were strangers in Egypt." "If thou meet thy 
enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring 
it back to him," &c. &c. 
</p><p>
There is reason to believe that Solomon understood the 
law in its true sense, and we have his opinion as to retaliation of injuries, viz : " Say not, I will recompense evil ; but 
wait upon the Lord, and he will save thee." Again, " Say 
not, I will do to him as he hath done to me. I will render 
to the man according to his work." And again, " If thine 
enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat ; and if he be 
thirsty, give him water to drink ; for thou shall heap coals 
of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee." 
</p><p>
But a greater than Solomon has removed all doubts on 
this point. On being asked by a Jewish lawyer, which was 
the great commandment in the law, our Saviour answered, 
" Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first 
and the great commandment, and the second is like unto it ; 
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two 
commandments hang all the law and the prophets." It is 
manifest, therefore, that the love of God and the love of 
man are enjoined by the law ; and as the genuine love of 
the one comprehends that of the other, the apostle assures 
us that " Love is the fulfilling of the law" 
</p><p>
It is, nevertheless, certain, that erroneous opinions respecting retaliation, and who were to be regarded as neighbours, had long prevailed, and that our Saviour blamed and 
corrected those and many other unfounded doctrines. 
</p><p>
That the patriarchs sometimes violated the moral law, is 
a position not to be disputed. They were men, and subject 
to the frailties of our fallen nature. But I do not know nor 
believe, that any of them violated the moral law by the 
authority or with the approbation of the Almighty. I can 
find no instance of it in the Bible. Nor do I know of any 
action done according to the moral law, that is censured or 
forbidden by the gospel. On the contrary, it appears to 
me that the gospel strongly enforces the whole moral law, 
and clears it from the vain traditions and absurd comments 
which had obscured and misapplied certain parts of it. 
</p><p>
As, therefore, Divine ordinances did authorize just war — 
as those ordinances were necessarily consistent with the 
moral law, and as the moral law is incorporated in the 
Christian dispensation, I think it follows, that the right to 
W&gejust and necessary war is admitted, and not abolished 
by the gospel. 
</p><p>
You seem to doubt whether there ever was a just war, 
and that it would puzzle even Solomon to find one. 
</p><p>
Had such a doubt been proposed to Solomon, an answer 
to it would probably have been suggested to him by a very 
memorable and interesting war which occurred in his day. 
I allude to the war in which his brother Absalom on the 
one side, and his father David on the other, were the belligerent parties. That war was caused by, and proceeded 
from " the lusts" of Absalom, and was horribly wicked. 
But the war waged against him by David, was not caused 
by, nor did proceed from " the lusts" of David, but was 
right, just, and necessary. Had David submitted to be 
dethroned by his detestable son, he would, in my opinion, 
have violated his moral duty and betrayed his official trust. 
</p><p>
Although just war is not forbidden by the gospel in express terms, yet you think an implied prohibition of all war, 
without exception, is deducible from the answer of our Lord 
to Pilate, viz : " If my kingdom were of this world, then 
would my servants fight," &c. 
</p><p>
At the conclusion of the last supper, our Lord said to his 
disciples, " He that hath no sword, let him now sell his garment and buy one." They answered, " Lord, here are two 
swords." He replied, " It is enough." 
</p><p>
It is not to be presumed that our Lord would have 
ordered swords to be provided, but for some purpose for 
which a sword was requisite, nor that he would have been 
satisfied with two, if more had been necessary. 
</p><p>
Whatever may have been the purposes for which swords 
were ordered, it is certain that the use of one of those 
swords soon caused an event, which confirmed the subsequent defence of our Lord before Pilate, and also produced 
other important results. When the officers and their band 
arrived, with swords and with staves, to take Jesus, they 
who were about him saw what would follow. " They said 
unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword ?" It does 
not appear that any of the eleven disciples who were with 
him, except one, made the least attempt to defend him. 
But Peter, probably inferring from the order for swords, 
that they were now to be used, proceeded to " smite a servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear." Jesus 
(perhaps, among other reasons, to abate inducements to 
prosecute Peter for that violent attack) healed the ear. 
</p><p>
He ordered Peter to put his sword into its sheath, and 
gave him two reasons for it. The first related to himself, 
and amounted to this, that he would make no opposition, 
saying, " The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I 
not drink ?" The second related to Peter, viz. they who 
take the sword, shall perish by the sword ; doubtless 
meaning that they who take and use a sword, as Peter had 
just done, without lawful authority, and against lawful 
authority, incur the penalty and risk of perishing by the 
sword. This meaning seems to be attached to those words 
by the occasion and circumstances which prompted them. 
If understood in their unlimited latitude, they would contradict the experience and testimony of all ages, it being 
manifest that many military men die peaceably in their 
beds. 
</p><p>
The disciples did believe and expect that Jesus had 
come to establish a temporal kingdom. " They trusted 
that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel." 
" They knew not the Scripture, that he must rise again 
from the dead ; questioning one with another what the 
rising from the dead should mean." Even after his resurrection, they appear to have entertained the same belief 
and expectation ; for on the very day he ascended, they 
asked him, " Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel V 
The order for swords, and the declaration that two were 
enough, tended to confirm that belief and expectation, and 
to inspire a confidence that he who had commanded the 
winds and the waves, and had raised the dead to life, was 
able, as well as willing, to render the two swords sufficient 
to vanquish his enemies. Could any thing less than such a 
firm belief and confidence have prompted eleven such men, 
and with only two swords among them, to offer to "smite 
with the sword" the armed band, which under officers appointed by the Jewish rulers, had come to apprehend their 
master \ 
</p><p>
Great must have been the disappointment and astonishment of the disciples, when Jesus unexpectedly and peaceably submitted to the power and malice of his enemies, 
directing Peter to sheath his sword, and hinting to him the 
danger he had incurred by drawing it: amazed and terrified, they forsook him and lied. This catastrophe so surprised, and subdued the intrepidity of Peter, as that he was 
no longer " ready to go with his master to prison and to 
death." 
</p><p>
It seems that perplexity, consternation, and tumultuous 
feelings overwhelmed his faith and reflection, and that his 
agitations receiving fresh excitement from the danger and 
dread of discovery, which soon after ensued, impelled him 
with heedless precipitation to deny his Master. This denial proved bitter to Peter, and it taught him and others that 
spiritual strength can be sustained only by the spiritual 
bread which cometh down from heaven. 
</p><p>
The Jews accused Jesus before Pilate of aspiring to the 
temporal sovereignty of their nation, in violation of the 
regal rights of Caesar. Jesus, in his defence, admitted that 
he was King, but declared that his kingdom was not of this 
world. For the truth of this assertion, he appealed to the 
peaceable behaviour of his adherents, saying, "If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I 
should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is my kingdom 
not from hence." 
</p><p>
Pilate, who doubtless well knew what had been the conduct of Jesus, both before and at the time of his apprehension, was satisfied, but the Jews were not. They exclaimed, " If thou let this man go, thou art not Cassar's 
friend ; whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against 
Caesar." " We have no king but Caesar." 
</p><p>
You and I understand the words in question very differently. Is there the least reason to infer from the belief and 
conduct of the disciples, that they were restrained from 
fighting by the consideration that their Master's kingdom 
was not of this world ? On the contrary, did they not believe and expect that he had come to restore one of the 
kingdoms of this world to Israel ? The fact is, that they 
were ready and willing to fight. Did they not ask him, 
" Lord, shall we smite with the sword V It was his will, 
therefore, and not their will, which restrained them from 
fighting ; and for that restraint he assigned a very conclusive reason, viz. because his kingdom was not of this 
world. 
</p><p>
To the advancement and support of his spiritual sovereignty over his spiritual kingdom, soldiers and swords, 
and corporeal exertions were inapplicable and useless. 
But, on the other hand, soldiers and swords, and corporeal 
exertions are necessary to enable the several temporal 
rulers of the states and kingdoms of this world, to maintain 
their authority and protect themselves and their people ; 
and our Saviour expressly declared, that if his kingdom 
had been of this world, then would his servants fight to 
protect him ; or in other words, that then and in that case, 
he would not have restrained them from fighting. The 
lawfulness bf such fighting, therefore, instead of being 
denied, is admitted and confirmed by that declaration. 
</p><p>
This exposition coincides with the answer given by John 
the Baptist (who was " filled with the Holy Ghost") to the 
soldiers who asked him what they should do, viz. " Do 
violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages." Can these words be rationally understood as meaning thai they should receive wages for 
nothingl Or, that when ordered to march against the 
enemy, they should refuse to proceed ; or that, on meeting 
the enemy, they should either run away, or passively submit to be captured or slaughtered ' This would be attaching a meaning to his answer very foreign to the sense of 
the words in which he expressed it. 
</p><p>
Had the gospel regarded war as being in every case sinful, it seems strange that the apostle Paul should have been 
so unguarded, as in teaching the importance of faith, to 
use an argument which clearly proves the lawfulness of 
war, viz. " That it was through faith that Gideon, David, 
and others waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the 
armies of aliens ;" thereby confirming the declaration of 
David, that it was God who had "girded him with strength 
to battle ; and had taught his hands to war, and his fingers 
to fight." 
</p><p>
The gospel appears to me to consider the servants of 
Christ as having two capacities or characters, with correspondent duties to sustain and fulfil. 
</p><p>
Being subjects of his spiritual kingdom, they are bound 
in that capacity to fight pursuant to his orders, with spiritual weapons, against his and their spiritual enemies. 
</p><p>
Being also subjects, and partakers in the rights and interests of a temporal or worldly state or kingdom, they are 
in that capacity bound, whenever lawfully required, to fight 
with weapons in just and necessary war,against the worldly 
enemies of that state or kingdom. 
</p><p>
Another view may be taken of the subject. The depravity which mankind inherited from their first parents, 
introduced wickedness into the world. That wickedness 
rendered human government necessary to restrain the violence and injustice resulting from it. To facilitate the 
establishment and administration of government, the human 
race became, in the course of Providence, divided into 
separate and distinct nations. Every nation instituted a 
government, with authority and power to protect it against 
domestic and foreign aggressions. Each government provided for the internal peace and security of the nation, by 
laws for punishing their offending subjects. The law of all 
the nations prescribed the conduct which they were to observe towards each other, and allowed war to be waged 
by an innocent against an offending nation, when rendered 
just and necessary by unprovoked, atrocious, and unredressed injuries. 
</p><p>
Thus two kinds of justifiable warfare arose — one against 
domestic malefactors ; the other against foreign aggressors. 
The first being regulated by the law of the land ; the 
second by the law of nations ; and both consistently with 
the moral law. 
</p><p>
As to the^rs^ species of warfare, in every state or kingdom, the government or executive ruler has, throughout all 
ages, pursued, and often at the expense of blood, attacked, 
captured, and subdued murderers, robbers, and other offenders. By force confining them in chains and in prisons ; 
and by force inflicting on them punishment, never rendering 
to them good for evil ; for that duty attaches to individuals 
in their personal or private capacities ; but not to rulers or 
magistrates in their official capacities. This species of war 
has constantly and universally been deemed just and indispensable. On this topic the gospel is explicit. It commands us to obey the higher powers or ruler. It reminds 
us " that he beareth not the sword in vain ;" that " he is the 
minister of God, and a revenger to execute wrath upon 
him that doeth evil." Now, if he is not to bear the sword 
in vain, it follows that he is to use it to execute wrath on 
evil doers, and consequently to draw blood and to kill on 
proper occasions. 
As to the second species of warfare, it certainly is 
reasonable and as righl thai a nation be secure against injustice, disorder, and rapine from without, as from within: 
and therefore that it is the right and the duty of the government or ruler, to use force and the sword to protect and 
maintain the rights of his people against evil doers of another nation. The reason and necessity of using force and 
the sword being the same in both eases, the right or the 
law must be the same also. 
</p><p>
We are commanded to render to our government, or to 
our " Caesar, the things that are Caesar's;" that is, the things 
which belong to him, and not the things which do not 
belong to him. And surely this command eannot be construed to intend or imply, that we ought to render to the 
Caesar of another nation more than belongs to him. 
</p><p>
In case some powerful Caesar should demand of us to 
receive and obey a king of his nomination, and unite with 
him in all his wars, or that he would commence hostilities 
against us ; what answer would it be proper for us to give 
to such a demand? In my opinion we ought to refu 
and vigorously defend our independence by arms. To 
what other expedient could we have recourse? I cannot 
think that the gospel authorizes or encourages us, on such 
an occasion, to abstain from resistance, and to expect miracles to deliver us. 
</p><p>
A very feeble unprepared nation, on receiving such a 
demand, might hesitate and find it expedient to adopt the 
policy intimated in the gospel ; viz. " What king, going to 
war against another king, sitteth not down first andconsulteth whether he be aide with ten thousand to meet him that 
cometh against him with twenty thousand ; or else he sendeth an embassage, and desireth conditions of peace," that 
is, makes the best bargain he can. 
</p><p>
If the United States should unanimously resolve never 
more to use the sword, would a certified copy of it prove 
to be an effectual Mediterranean passport ? Would it 
reform the predatory rulers of Africa, or persuade the successive potentates of Europe to observe towards us the 
conduct of real Christians 1 On the contrary, would it not 
present new facilities, and consequently produce new excitements to the gratification of avarice and ambition ? 
</p><p>
It is true, that even just war is attended with evils, and 
so likewise is the administration of government and of 
justice ; but is that a good reason for abolishing either of 
them ? They are means by which greater evils are 
averted. Among the various means necessary to obviate 
or remove, or repress, or to mitigate the various calamities, 
dangers, and exigences, to which in this life we are exposed, how few are to be found which do not subject us to 
troubles, privations, and inconveniences of one kind or 
other. To prevent the incursion or continuance of evils, 
we must submit to the use of those means, whether agreeable or otherwise, which reason and experience prescribe. 
</p><p>
It is also true, and to be lamented, that war, however 
just and necessary, sends many persons out of this world 
who are ill prepared for a better. And so also does the 
law in all countries. So also does navigation and other 
occupations. Are they therefore all sinful and forbidden ? 
</p><p>
However desirable the abolition of all wars may be, yet 
until the morals and manners of mankind are greatly 
changed, it will be found impracticable. We are taught 
that national sins will be punished, and that war is one of 
the punishments. The prophets predict wars at so late a 
period as the restoration of the Israelites. Who or what 
can hinder the occurrence of those wars ? 
</p><p>
I nevertheless believe, and have perfect faith in the prophecy, that the time will come when " the nations will beat 
their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks ; when nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." But, does 
not this prophecy clearly imply, and give us plainly to understand, that in the meanwhile, and until the arrival of that 
blessed period, the nations will not heat their swords into 
ploughshares, nor their spears into pruning-hooks ; that 
nation will nol forbear to lift up sword against nation, nor 
cease to learn war ' 
</p><p>
It may 1 d, are we to do nothing to hasten the arri
val of that happy period ! Literally, no created being can 
either accelerate or retard its arrival. It will not arrive 
sooner nor later than the appointed time. 
</p><p>
There certainly is reason to expect, that as great providential events have usually been preceded and introduced 
by the intervention of providential means to prepare the 
way for them, so the great event in question will be preceded and introduced in like manner. It is, I think, more 
than probable, that the unexpected and singular co-operation, and the extraordinary zeal and efforts of almost all 
Christian nations to extend the light and knowledge of the 
gospel, and to inculcate its doctrines, are among those preparatory means. It is the duty of Christians to promote 
the prevalence and success of such means, and to look forward with faith and hope to the result of them. 
</p><p>
But, whatever may be the time, or the means adopted 
by <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> for the abolition of war, I think we may, 
without presumption, conclude, that mankind must be prepared and fitted for the reception, enjoyment, and preservation of universal permanent peace, before they will be 
blessed with it. Arc the}- as yet fitted for it? Certainly 
not. Even if it was practicable, would it be wise to disarm 
the good before " the wicked cease from troubling ?" By 
what other means than arms and military force, can unoffending rulers and nations protect their rights against 
unprovoked aggressions from within and from without? 
Are there any other means to which they could recur, and 
on the efficacy of which they could rely ? To this question I have not as yet heard, nor seen, a direct and precise 
answer. 
These remarks would have been written and sent sooner, 
had my health been better. Expedition not being requisite, 
I attended to them only at intervals which allowed and invited me to do so. 
</p><p>
We differ in opinion, and I am persuaded with equal 
sincerity. 
</p><p>
With real esteem and regard, I remain, 
</p><p>
Your friend,
