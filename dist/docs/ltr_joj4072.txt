Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The violence of your political storm seems to have abated, 
but I should not be surprised if you should frequently have 
March weather. 
</p><p>
Accounts from America lead me to suspect that your 
commercial negotiations with us will not be facilitated by 
delay ; and I should not be surprised if a system should 
then be adopted, which would render European proclamations of very little importance to that country. It appears 
more probable that England will outwit herself. There is 
a tide in human affairs which, like other tides, turns only 
to run in an opposite direction. 
</p><p>
I am preparing to go to New-York by the first good 
vessel that may sail for that port. I more than wish to see 
you there. They who know the nature of man expect perfection nowhere. There are certain degrees in refinement 
and arts, which are more favourable than others to those 
principles and manners which wise men prefer. In this, as 
well as in some other circumstances, we have the advantage 
of other countries. Various causes conspire to give every 
man his weight, and I believe the old maxim of " quisque 
sues faber est fortunes? has fewer exceptions in America 
than elsewhere. They who bring with them ideas borrowed from the regions of fancy and romance will be disappointed. The golden age will not cease to be a fable 
until the millennium ; until that period for separating life 
from death, pleasure from pain, virtue from vice, and 
wisdom from folly, every society and country will continue 
to partake more or less of the heterogeneous and discordant 
principles, which seem to be the seeds both of moral and 
natural evil. 
</p><p>
Were I in your situation, I would see for myself, and 
then determine. To avoid mistakes, it is necessary to see 
things as being what they really are. Minutias are often 
omitted, or imperfectly drawn in representations. Great 
part of the good within our reach depend on minutiae ; they 
merit more attention than many apprehend. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my respectful compliments to Lord 
and Lady Shelburne. I hope his gout has left him. Remember me also to our patriot friend, Doctor Price. 
</p><p>
Adieu my dear sir, 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely, 
</p><p>
