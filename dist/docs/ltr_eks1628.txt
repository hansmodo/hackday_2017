As General Worth thought the opportunity a safe 
one, I sent you a packet yesterday which has been 
accumulating since the tenth instant. I begin again 
but with not the least idea when my letter will leave. 
Perfect quiet has reigned throughout the city for some 
days. Last night we heard that there is no army advancing from Mexico as had been stated but that there 
is a force of twelve thousand at a strong point, El 
Penon, three leagues this side of the city.

May 28. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> arrived today at one o clock. 
Uncle Edmund is with him but I have not yet seen 
him. We changed our quarters at two o clock today 
from one side of the city to the other. Later I will 
describe our position. Mem. A beautiful Mexican 
girl, the niece of General Furlong, kissed her pretty 
hand repeatedly to me this evening whilst her carriage 
was standing near my quarters. Don t be jealous! 
I do not know her; she probably thought I was one 
of General Worth's staff nevertheless, she is a very 
sweet young lady as I testified by my admiring looks.

May 29. General Twiggs with his division arrived 
today and I received several letters. . . .

Monday, May ji. We hear from Mexico this evening that Santa Anna has resigned all his offices and 
wishes to leave the country, in consequence of the 
strength of the peace party. He says, we are told, in 
his proclamation that personally and politically he is 
in the way of peace and therefore retires. He is a 
scamp and everything he does causes distrust, 
but should the above prove true, I shall draw the very 
best auguries from it. If Herrera is President, or if 
Gomez Farrias and Rejou are in power, peace, sweet 
peace must follow.

June i. I have a touch of rheumatism today in my 
foot; it is swollen some and very painful. It looks 
amazingly like gout, and I am so weak as to feel 
ashamed of it so have concealed it from all. I dined 
today with Uncle Edmund and in the afternoon took a 
long walk about the city examining the many curious 
things in the shops, of which none are, perhaps, 
more strange to our eyes than the equipments for 
horses. Grotesque spurs, bridles, harnesses, etc., rich 
with silver ornaments, tempted me to make up a box 
of curiosities to send home by the first opportunity. 
There are many hacks about the streets to be hired 
at a reasonable rate. They are drawn by mules and 
driven by postillions. The tails of the animals are 
enclosed in large, leathern bags, often ornamented and 
embossed with brass or silver but whether they are 
worn to spare the modesty of the mules or the biped 
passengers I have not yet ascertained. After being 
well fatigued with our ramble and my rheumatic foot 
throbbing like the toothache, we, in company with 
Colonel Hitchcock who had joined us in the streets, 
adjourned to an ice cream shop for refreshment. By 
the bye, this is the first place in Mexico where I have 
found the ice cream good and well flavored one 
shilling per glass.

June 2. Have not left my quarters today except 
to attend parades. I have, however, heard this evening that an extensive department, the Tierra Cali- 
ente, has pronounced for the Americans that is for 
peace. Whether this be true or not, all the signs show 
that a large party among the Mexican people are in 
favor of a negotiation which must soon commence 
unless our apparent weakness, we being but a forlorn 
hope in the heart of a great nation, should induce their 
leaders to suppose they can crush us. A crisis is at 
hand and we shall either have desperate fighting or 
the yellow gentry must give up. Trist is here with 
the three million but I can only allude to his opera 
tions and our military dispositions, as it is an even 
chance that this will fall into the hands of the enemy 
as did the first mail sent from this place to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>. 
</p><p>
June j. A mail will leave at daylight in the morning 
and my letter must be in the bag at dark. I was going 
to a regular bullfight this afternoon in the hope of 
seeing a Mexican matadore killed. Am I not a good 
fellow to give up such a pleasure to write to you ? 
The news still continues to prove that the peace party 
is gaining strength throughout the country, though 
before we get a peace I think we shall have one great 
battle. The signs are now that we shall advance in a 
few days and perhaps " revel in the Halls/ before the 
end of the month. . . .
