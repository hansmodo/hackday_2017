Dear Brother: After I get fixed in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>, I will 
cast about for some chance to be independent of our 
Government, for I feel there is a desire to be rid of me. 
Stanton, in Grant's absence, has ordered one of my chief 
staff -officers away from me, Beckwith, without as much 
as "by your leave." Now this was never done save by 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff. Davis</a> when he was Secretary of War, for orders to 
the army officers always should go by command of the 
commander-in-chief, but Stanton orders about as though 
it was his lawful prerogative. I would resist publicly, 
but don't want to bring on another controversy. Of 
course, if my staff -officers are taken away without my 
being consulted, they will feel little dependence online, 
and my influence will subside. But-^fehat-isa small 
matter compared with turning the army into a machine 
auxiliary to politics. If the War Department is to give 
orders direct to the army below us and not through us, 
you can see that we are dissolved from all control, responsibility, or interest. The true way is for the War 
Department to indicate to us what the Administration 
wants done, and then hold us responsible for the means 
used. But if the Secretary handles the army behind us, 
how can we take an interest? My own opinion is the 
Administration will either break itself down or drive us 
out. Grant is so anxious for harmony that he will not 
interfere until it is too late, when he will find somebody 
else commands instead of him.

I think the agitation of the suffrage question now 
before the people has got far enough advanced to show 
how they (the negroes) can make a living, and will give 
trouble, but we hope still that even that question will be 
allowed to rest until the forms and shapes of the States 
South are adjusted. ... I fear you will all have a burden to carry in the form of Military Governments South, 
which are awkward and expensive. My command a only 
embraces Arkansas, and there things seem quiet, though 
I know but little of the actual state of affairs. In no 
other point of my command do these questions arise.

Yours affectionately,
