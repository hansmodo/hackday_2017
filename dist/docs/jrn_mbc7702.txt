John Chesnut had a basket of champagne carried to my house, oysters, partridges, and other 
good things, for a supper after the reception. He is going back to the army to-morrow.

James Chesnut arrived on Wednesday. He has been giving Buck his opinion of one of her performances last 
night. She was here, and the General's carriage drove up, bringing some of our girls, They told her he could not 
come up and he begged she would go down there for a moment. She flew down, and stood ten minutes in that snow, 
Cy holding the carriage-door open. " But, Colonel Chesnut, there was no harm. I was not there ten minutes. I 
could not get in the carriage because I did not mean to stay one minute. He did not hold my hands that is, not 
half the time Oh, you saw ! well, he did kiss my hands. Where is the harm of that? " All men worship Buck. 
How can they help it, she is so lovely.

Lawrence has gone back ignominiously to South Carolina. At breakfast already in some inscrutable way he 
had become intoxicated; he was told to move a chair, and he raised it high over his head, smashing Mrs. Grundy's 
chandelier. My husband said : " Mary, do tell Lawrence to go home; I am too angry to speak to him." So Lawrence 
went without another word. He will soon be back, and when he comes will say, Shoo ! I knew Mars Jeems could 
not do without me. And indeed he can not.

Buck, reading my journal, opened her beautiful eyes in amazement and said: " So little do people know them 
selves! See what you say of me! " I replied: " The girls heard him say to you, Oh, you are so childish and so 
sweet ! Now, Buck, you know you are not childish. You have an abundance of strong common sense. Don't let men 
adore you so if you can help it. You are so unhappy about men who care for you, when they are killed.

Isabella says that war leads to love-making. She says these soldiers do more courting here in a day than they 
would do at home, without a war, in ten years. 
</p><p>
In the pauses of conversation, we hear, She is the no blest woman God ever made! " " Goodness! " exclaims 
Isabella. "Which one ? The amount of courting we hear in these small rooms. Men have to go to the front, and they say their say desperately. I am beginning to know all about it. The girls tell me. And I overhear I can not 
help it. But this style is unique, is it not ? Since I saw you last year standing by the turnpike gate, you know 
my battle-cry has been: God, my country, and you! So many are lame. Major Venable says : " It is not the 
devil on two sticks/ now; the farce is Cupid on Crutches.".

General Breckinridge's voice broke in: " They are my cousins. So I determined to kiss them good-by. Good-by 
nowadays is the very devil ; it means forever, in all probability, you know; all the odds against us. So I advanced 
to the charge soberly, discreetly, and in the fear of the Lord. The girls stood in a row four of the very prettiest 
I ever saw. Sam, with his eyes glued to the floor, cried : 
" You were afraid you backed out." " But I did nothing of the kind. I kissed every one of them honestly, heartily."
