I SEND you every newspaper that comes out, and I 
send you, now and then, a few sheets of paper, but 
this article is as scarce here, as with you. I would 
send a quire, if I could get a conveyance. 
</p><p>
I write you now and then a line, as often as I can, but I can tell you no news, but what I send in the public papers.

We are waiting, it is said, for commissioners; a 
messiah that will never come. This story of commissioners is as arrant an illusion as ever was hatched 
in the brain of an enthusiast, a politician, or a maniac. 
I have laughed at it, scolded at it, grieved at it, and I 
don t know but I may, at an unguarded moment, have 
rip d at it But it is vain to reason against such delusions. I was very sorry to see, in a letter from the 
General, that he had been bubbled with it ; and still 
more, to see, in a letter from my sagacious friend, 
W. at Plymouth, that he was taken in too. 
</p><p>
My opinion is, that the commissioners and the com 
mission have been here, (I mean in America,) these 
two months. The Governors, Mandamus Councillors, Collectors and Comptrollers and Commanders of 
the army and navy, I conjecture, compose the list, 
and their power is to receive submissions. But \ve are 
not in a very submissive mood. They will get no ad- 
vantage of us. We shall go on to perfection, I believe. I have been very busy for some time ; have 
written about ten sheets of paper, with my own hand, 
about some trifling affairs, I which I may mention some time or other not now, for fear of accidents.

What will come of this labor, time will discover. I shall get nothing by it, I believe, because I never 
get anything by anything that I do. I am sure the 
public or posterity ought to get something. I believe 
my children will think I might as well have thought 
and labored a little, night and day, for their benefit. 
Hut I will not bear the reproaches of my children. I 
will tell them, that I studied and labored to procure a 
free constitution of government for them to solace 
themselves under, and if they do not prefer this to ample fortune, to case and elegance, they are not my 
--children, and I care not what becomes of them. They shall live upon thin diet, wear mean clothes, and work 
hard with cheerful hearts and free spirits, or they may be the children of the earth, or of no one, for me.

John has genius and so has Charles. Take care that they Don't go astray. Cultivate their minds, in 
spire their little hearts, raise their wishes. Fix their attention upon great and glorious objects. Root out 
every little thing. Weed out every meanness. Make them great and manly. Teach them to acorn injustice, ingratitude, cowardice and falsehood. Let them revere nothing hut religion, morality and liberty.

Abby and Tommy are not forgotten by me although I did not mention them before. The first, by 
reason of her sex, requires a different education from the two I have mentioned. Of this, you are the only judge. I want to send each of my little pretty flock 
some present or other. I have walked over this city twenty times, and gaped at every shop, like a countryman, to find something, but could not. Ask every 
one of them what they would choose to have, and write it to me in your next letter. From this I shall judge of their taste and fancy and discretion.
