Dear Sister
</p><p>
As three successive mails have arrived, without bringing a single letter from you, I am (and I think not without reason) uneasy about your health. As I do not know of any other reason but bad health which could have prevented your writing to a brother who is interested in everything that interests you. And I hope that if you have any regard for my peace of mind that you will write at least once every fortnight. If your health forbids your writing at any time, then get someone to write for you, if it should be but a dozen lines. I do not think that a regular mail has left this city, without carrying a letter for you from me.

The treaty has arrived from Washington, with its amendments. Many think that it will receive the ratification of this government. But some think that it will not. For my own part I hope it will. Mr. Sevier I presume will be here in a few days. At last dates from Queretaro there were wanting fifteen congressmen, and three senators to complete the quorum. We have received news here of a battle at [Chiguagua], in which we took fourteen pieces of artillery from the enemy. I am at present studying Humboldt's history of Mexico, in Spanish. The rain is quite abundant here at present and interferes somewhat with my evening visits. It is believed that our presence here is destroying the extreme superstition of this country. But not withstanding the influence of our presence, the natives still with uncovered heads drop on their knees, at the approach of the Archbishop's carriage; which is recognized by its being drawn by two spotted mules.

General Pillow's trial is not yet finished and the general opinion is that it will be terminated in the United States. We are told here that our people at home, think that the army do not wish to return from Mexico, but if such is the truth they are much mistaken. An expedition started a few days since, for [Popocatepitl] which is a volcanic mountain to the S.E. of and in full view of this city, and which still issues clouds of smoke at times. I should probably have gone my self, but as the temperature is so extremely low, resulting from the crest being capped with snow, I feared that my health might suffer.

In conformity with the armistice, the Mexicans have taken possession of their archives, and have resumed the civil administration of their government. Santa Anna at last news, was at his hacienda near Jalapa (Encerro) again bidding adieu to his country. Whilst at his hacienda he received the visits of Colonel Hews, and several other American officers. General Valencia died a few days since in this city, the news of which proved fatal to his daughter, who died a few hours subsequent to its reception. I have heard of no other who mourned his fate. The general hospital is ordered to be moved to Jalapa, and General Patterson I believe will go down at the same time, to take command of the station. This movement appears to indicate an anticipation of leaving the country.

Remember me to Mr. Arnold, Thomas and other friends.
