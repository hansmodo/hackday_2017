MY DEAR BROTHER, I have been for more than three 
weeks indebted to you for two very agreeable letters, 
which Mr. Otis brought from you. They would not have 
remained so long unanswered but for a variety of circumstances which have concurred to engross all my time during 
that period. It is possible that you may have observed in 
the Centinel about a month since, that a Committee of 21 
inhabitants of this Town was chosen in town-meeting, to 
report to the town what measures it might be proper to 
take in order to reform the present state of the police of 
the town ; and you may have noticed that my name was among those of several of the most respectable characters 
in this town upon that Committee ; if you read the Centinels in course as they arrive, you must have seen that this 
Committee reported a certain plan, which after being de 
bated in town meeting for three days was finally rejected 
by the votes of 700 men against more than 500 who were 
in favor of its adoption. If you have noticed all these 
circumstances, it is probable you may feel some degree of 
curiosity to know something further upon the subject: 
You will perhaps wish to be informed what it is, that has 
thus agitated the whole town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> these five or six 
weeks, how it happened that I was placed upon this same 
Committee, and why the report was rejected. I will tell 
you, at the risque of fatiguing you with a tedious narration, 
which you may throw aside if it should become intolerable. 
The Government of this town, in its corporate capacity, 
like that of all the other towns in this Commonwealth, is a 
pure democracy; all the affairs of the town are transacted 
by the inhabitants in town meeting assembled, or by committees appointed by them ; excepting certain powers 
which are vested in the Select-men, and which are very 
immaterial. The by-laws of the corporation are supposed 
to be enacted by the whole body of the people, and to be 
put in force by trials before Justices of the Peace. In con 
sequence of this system, the fact is, that no by-laws are 
enforced at all, and the inhabitants arc subjected to various 
inconveniences, for the want of some internal regulation. 
Several attempts have been heretofore made to introduce 
a reformation, and to induce the inhabitants to request for 
a city charter. Those attempts have always been in 
effectual, and the inconveniences have continued. About 
six weeks since, a town meeting was called, where after a debate upon the subject, in which the objects to be reformed 
were fully laid open and explained, the Committee, which I 
have already mentioned, were chosen. It was a subject 
upon which I felt altogether uninterested, having been so 
short a time an inhabitant of the town, and suffering personally very little from the inconveniences which had occasioned the complaints from whence that town-meeting 
resulted. I happened however quite accidentally to be 
present at the meeting and was nominated by Dr. Jarvis, 
to be a member of the Committee, and was accordingly 
chosen. He was indeed the last man in this town from 
whom I should have expected such a nomination, and I 
cannot very readily account for his motives. Dr. Welsh 
asked him what his object was; and he answered, "that 
this country was under great obligations to my father, 
and he thought it very proper that some notice should be 
taken of his son ; that he observed I generally attended 
the town-meetings, and appeared to interest myself in the 
affairs of the town ; that I was a sensible young man " 
(excuse the vanity of the relation) "and he wished to hear 
my sentiments upon this subject." I mention these circumstances because it will, I believe, be somewhat surprising to your father, as it was to myself, that the first public 
notice ever shown me by the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> should 
proceed from the nomination of Dr. Jarvis. I may now proceed to the transaction of the business itself. The Committee met several times, and after discussing the subject 
amply and deliberating with great coolness and harmony 
agreed upon the plan which was proposed, and which you 
have perhaps read. The agreement was unanimous, with 
one exception, which was Mr. B. Austin, commonly called 
Honestus ; he set his face against the reform from the beginning and did not agree to one article of the report. 
All the rest, though many of them differing widely as the poles, in most of their political sentiments, were fully 
agreed upon this point. When the report was debated in town-meeting Austin opposed it with the utmost degree of 
vehemence and absurdity. "It was to destroy the liberties of the people ; it was a resignation of the sovereignty of the 
town; it was a link in the chain of aristocratic influence; it was intended in its operation to throw the whole burden 
of taxation upon the poor." In short his speeches were such a farrago of nonsense and folly that it was hardly 
possible to imagine they could have any effect at all. On the other hand, Sullivan and Jarvis and Otis with several 
other gentlemen argued the whole subject over and over 
with more popular eloquence than I ever saw exhibited 
upon any other occasion ; yet upon the final question, the 
result was as I have stated, seven hundred men, who looked 
as if they had been collected from all the jails on the continent, with Ben. Austin like another Jack Cade at their 
head, outvoted by their numbers all the combined weight 
and influence of wealth and abilities and of integrity, of 
the whole town. From the whole event I have derived 
some instruction, and above all a confirmation of my abhorrence and contempt of simple democracy as a Government ; 
but I took no part in the debate. It was indeed a very 
good opportunity, that was offered me, of opening a political 
career, especially as I had been put upon the Committee; 
but for a variety of reasons I chose at least to postpone to 
some future period, my appearance as a speaker in town 
meeting; the principal of which was a want of confidence 
in myself, which operated most forcibly upon me. I hope, 
however, the time will come, when I shall not be so much oppressed by my diffidence. 
</p><p>
But the sequel of the story is no less curious than the rest. 
The day after the question was decided, Russell the printer 
demanded of Austin, in the public street, satisfaction, for 
a personal insult he had received from him at the town- 
meeting ; and upon Austin's refusing to give satisfaction, 
Russell treated him with every possible indignity, and 
gave him a severe corporeal bruising : upon which Austin 
spread abroad that Russell was the mere instrument of 
aristocratic revenge, and that he did not act from resentment 
for his own injury, but at the instigation of a few rich men, 
who were enraged at seeing the success with which he had 
advocated the cause of the people. And such was the obsequious servility of his rabble, that in consequence of this 
suggestion, several hundreds of them assembled the same 
evening; threatened to pull down Russell's printing office, 
and the houses of the aristocrats who wished to enslave the 
people, and actually paraded the streets with clubs, and 
with violent menaces for two or three hours ; however they 
did no real mischief, and the matter seems now to have 
blown over pretty generally ; though the partizans on both 
sides are still warm and ready to quarrel. I have from the 
beginning taken the part of a spectator rather than that 
of an actor in the scene, and I think the whole affair has 
given me some additional knowledge of human nature. 
</p><p>
The present is quite a busy time in our political world; 
there are several other subjects upon which I could write 
you other letters as long and as tedious as this ; but I must 
reserve some of my information for your father, to whom 
I am ashamed not to have written this long time. I intend 
soon to give him some account of another occurrence, 
which has made not a little political agitation in our atmosphere. 
</p><p>
I have not much more to say to you respecting myself. 
Our Court of Common Pleas have sat again since I wrote 
you ; I argued one more cause, and was successful. I 
gain my causes, but I get no business : that is at as low an 
ebb as ever, but I am tolerably habituated to the lot, and 
say, with Ancient Pistol, "si fortuna me tormenta, il sperare me contenta." 
</p><p>
The petition from the North Parish in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a> is hitherto successful. The Committee of the General Court before 
whom I mentioned to you our having argued the point, 
reported in favour of the petitioners : the bill for incorporating the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=quincy" rel="city">Quincy</a>, has past the Senate and is 
now before the House of Representatives. Hichborn l has been indefatigable in his opposition to the business in every 
stage of it, but has not yet been able to defeat us. The question will not be finally decided till next week. 
</p><p>
Mr. Cranch has been in town about a fortnight upon this affair, and attending the Court of Common Pleas. 
He has recovered to all appearance from his sickness, though he does not look so healthy, or in such spirits, as he was wont. Our other friends are all well. 
</p><p>
Your brother.
