HEADQUARTERS, 15TH ARMY CORPS,

CAMP BEFORE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, Feb. , <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.

Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I now know the secret of this last tirade against me 
personally. 
</p><p>
Of course newspaper correspondents regard me as the 
enemy of their class. I announced that all such accompanying the expedition were and should be treated as 
spies. They are^spies because their publications reach 
the enemy, give them direct and minute information 
of the composition of our forces, and while invariably 
they puff /up their patrons, they pull down all others. 
Thus this man Knox, dating his paper upon the Steamer 
Continental, the headquarters of Generals Steele and 
Blair, gives to these general officers and their division 
undue praise, and libels and abuses all others. This not 
only plays into the hands of our enemies by' sowing 
dissensions among us, but it encourages discontent among 
the officers who find themselves abused by men seemingly under the influence of officers high in command. 
I caused Knox's communication to be read to him, 
paragraph by paragraph, and then showed him my instructions, by my orders made at the time, and the 
official reports of others, and how wide he was of the 
truth. *And now I have asked his arrest and trial by 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a>, on charges as a spy and informer. The 
57th Article of war, which is a Law of Congress, is as 
follows : " Who shall be convicted of holding correspondence with, or giving intelligence to the enemy, either 
directly or indirectly, shall suffer death, &c." I will 
endeavor to bring in all the facts, by means of the 
evidence of officers who took part in all these events. 
'My purpose is not to bring Knox to death or other 
severe punishment, but I do want to establish the principle that citizens shall not, against the orders of the 
competent military superior, attend a military expedition, 
report its proceedings, and comment on its officers. . . 
Affectionately your Brother,
