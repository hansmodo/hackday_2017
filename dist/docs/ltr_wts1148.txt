CAMP BEFORE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, April 3, '63. 
</p><p>
My Dear Brother: I received your long letter from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a>, for which I am much obliged. You certainly 
have achieved an envious name in the Senate, and I confess I am astonished at your industry and acquirements. 
I readily understand how, in a revolution of the magnitude that now involves us all, older men should devolve 
on you and the younger school of men the legislation 
and experiments necessary to meet a state of facts so 
different from the common run of events. The Finance 
Bill and Conscription Acts of the late Congress in my 
judgment may keep the management of the affairs of the 
nation in the hands of the Constitutional Government. 
Anything short of them, the war would have drifted out 
of the control of President and Congress. Now if Mr. 
Lincoln will assume the same position that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Davis</a> did at 
the outset, lie can unite the fighting North against the 
nghting South, and numerical force systematized will 
settle the war. I know the impatience of the people, 
but this is one of the lessons of war. People must learn 
that war is a question of physical force and courage. A 
million of men engaged in peaceful pursuits will be vanquished by a few thousand determined armed men. The 
justice of the cause has nothing to do with it. It is a 
question of force. Again we are the assailants, and have 
to overcome not only an equal number of determined 
men, however wrongfully engaged, but the natural obstacles of a most difficult country. . . .

They [i.e. newspaper correspondents] are unknown to 
me, appear in disguise of sutlers' clerks, cotton thieves 
and that class of vultures that hang around every army. 
Cl never saw or heard of Knox till he had published his 
falsehoods ; and when I did send for him, and he admitted 
how false he had been, he enunciated the sentiment that 
his trade was to collect news he must furnish reading 
matter for sale, true, if possible ; otherwise, false. . . .J 
</p><p>
It is absurd to say these correspondents relieve the 
anxiety of parents, friends, &c. My soldiers write ^constantly and receive immense numbers of letters. This 
is right, and if newspapers will report only local matters 
and discuss matters within their knowledge, parents and 
families would not be kept half frantic with the accounts 
of sickness, death, massacres, &c., of their children and 
relatives^ We have /hundreds of visitors from every 
quarter to examine our camps, because correspondents 
represented us as all dying, when the truth is no army 
was ever better provided for and supplied. We are 
camped on narrow slips of levee and ground, because 
all else is under water. To get on dry ground we must 
go back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> or Helena. . . .

McPherson is a splendid officer. Grant is honest and 
does his best. I will do as ordered. I will suggest 
little, as others talk of my failing to take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> 
and I want them to try a hand. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>.
