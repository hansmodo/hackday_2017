DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
When I had the pleasure of seeing your Excellency at Ramapo, I mentioned that the terms, for 
which the two militia regiments stationed at this 
post were engaged in service, expired the last of 
this month, at which time, unless a re enforcement is 
sent here by <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, the whole strength we 
shall have, at this important station, will be Colonel Dubois's regiment, two companies of artillery, and a 
detachment of about one hundred and fifty Continental troops under Lieutenant-Colonel Meigs. 
</p><p>
I have this day wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> on the subject, that he may so order matters as to furnish a 
reinforcement to this garrison, if he shall judge it expedient. 
</p><p>
I have had a second call to attend at Kingston, 
and take the oath of office in consequence of my 
late appointment ; and as the new Legislature of this 
State are to meet on the 1st of August, it will be 
necessary that I shall leave this, so as to be there a 
day or two previous to their meeting. 
</p><p>
This I have also mentioned to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, 
and requested leave of absence for an unlimited 
time, as the affairs of Government render it uncertain whether I shall be able, during the present campaign, to return to the command of this post. 
</p><p>
It is with a degree of pain that I am under a 
necessity of asking permission, at this time, to quit 
the service, especially as the designs of the enemy 
are not fully known ; and should the business of my 
new appointment admit of it, I will most cheerfully 
return to the army, until the fate of the present 
campaign is determined. I am, with much esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">GEORGE CLINTON</a>.
