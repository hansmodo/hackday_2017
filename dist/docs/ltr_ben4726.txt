DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you a few lines by Captain Falconer, and sent you 
Dr. Watson's new piece of Experiments in Inoculation, 
which I hope will be agreeable to you. 
</p><p>
In yours of November 20th, you mention the lead in the 
worms of stills as a probable cause of the dry belly-ache 
among punch-drinkers in our West Indies. I had before 
acquainted Dr. Baker with a fact of that kind, the General mischief done by the use of leaden worms, when rum-distilling was first practised in New England, which occasioned 
a severe law there against them ; and he has mentioned it in 
the second part of his piece not yet published. I have long 
been of opinion, that that distemper proceeds always from 
a metallic cause only; observing that it affects, among 
tradesmen, those that use lead, however different their trades, 
as glaziers, letter-founders, plumbers, potters, white-lead 
makers, and painters; (from the latter, it has been conjectured, it took its name colica Pictonum, by the mistake of a 
letter, and not from its being the disease of Poictou;) and, 
although the worms of stills ought to be of pure tin, they are 
often made of pewter, which has a great mixture in it of lead. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> people, pretending to interfere with the manufactures of this country, make a great clamour here against 
America in general. I have therefore endeavoured to palliate 
matters a little in several public papers. It would, as you 
justly observe, give less umbrage if we meddled only with 
such manufactures as England does not attend to. That 
of linen might be carried on more or less in every family, and 
silk, I think, in most of the colonies. But there are many 
manufactures that we cannot carry on to advantage, though 
we were at entire liberty. And, after all, this country is 
fond of manufactures beyond their real value, for the true 
source of riches is husbandry. Agriculture is truly productive of new wealth; manufacturers only change forms, 
and, whatever value they give to the materials they work 
upon, they in the mean time consume an equal value in 
provisions, &c. So that riches are not increased by manufacturing ; the only advantage is, that provisions in the shape 
of manufactures are more easily carried for sale to foreign 
markets. And where the provisions cannot be easily carried 
to market, it is well to transform them for our own use as well 
as foreign sale. In families also, where the children and 
servants of families have some spare time, it is well to employ 
it in making something, and in spinning or knitting, &c., 
to gather up the fragments (of time) that nothing may be lost, 
for those fragments, though small in themselves, amount to 
something great in the year, and the family must eat, whether 
they work or are idle. 
</p><p>
But this nation seems to have increased the number of 
its manufactures beyond reasonable bounds (for there are 
bounds to every thing), whereby provisions are now risen 
to an exorbitant price by the demand for supplying home 
mouths; so that there may be an importation from foreign 
countries ; but the expense of bringing provisions from abroad 
to feed manufacturers here will so enhance the price of the 
manufactures, that they may be made cheaper where the 
provisions grow, and the mouths will go to the meat. 
</p><p>
I am, with thanks for your good wishes, dear Sir, yours, 
&c., B. FRANKLIN.
