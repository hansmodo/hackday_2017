My attention was called this morning to two letters purporting to have been written at this city and published in the New York Herald, in which the writer discloses with remarkable accuracy and particularity the fact of the departure of Mr. N. P. Trist, chief clerk in the Department of State, on a mission to Mexico. The statement is so accurate and minute that the writer must have obtained information on the subject from someone who was entrusted with the secret. It was a profound Cabinet secret, and was so expressly declared by me to be, and was communicated to no one but to Mr. Trist himself and to Mr. Derrick, a clerk in the Department of State. For a full statement of the importance of keeping it a secret, see this diary of the 10th instant. In disclosing the fact of the mission of Mr. Trist and its objects, contrary to my solemn injunction, there has been treachery somewhere. I cannot believe that any of my Cabinet have betrayed my confidence, and conclude, in the absence of further information on the subject, that the disclosure must have been made by Mr. Derrick, the clerk in the State Department recommended by Mr. Buchanan as worthy of all confidence, and who was employed in preparing the writing. I have not been more vexed or excited since I have been President than at this occur rence. The success of Mr. Trist's mission I knew in the beginning must depend mainly on keeping it a secret from that portion of the Federal press and leading men in the country who, since the commencement of the war with Mexico, have been giving "aid and comfort" to the enemy by their course. I do not doubt that there are men among them who would incur the expense of sending a courier to Mexico, and incur any other expense, to discourage Mexico from making a peace, for the purpose of having the war continued, in the hope that the Democratic administration might be brought into disrepute by continuing it to a protracted length, and that they might gain some political advantage in the next Presidential election by it. I do not doubt that Mexico has been and will be discouraged from making peace, in the hope that their friends in the United States will come into power at the next Presidential election. That this has been the effect of the unpatriotic and anti-American course of the National Intelligencer and other Federal papers, all know.
