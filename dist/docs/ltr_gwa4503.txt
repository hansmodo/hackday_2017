Sir, 
</p><p>
A few minutes after my arrival upon this ground I received your Excellency's favor of this morning. Were I to give way to the anxiety I feel to see the union 
between your army and mine, I should request you to march to-morrow morning from North Castle ; but when I consider the fatigue, which your troops have 
undergone from their long and rapid marches at this very warm season, I am much inclined to wish you to give them one more day's rest in your present 
quarters, and the more so, as there is now no real occasion for making an uncommon degree of haste. 
I shall however leave the matter entirely to your Excellency's determination ; only wishing you to give me 
notice of your approach, that I may have the happiness of meeting and conducting you to your camp, 
which will be about four miles on this side of the village of White Plains. I have the honor to be, &lc. 
</p>
