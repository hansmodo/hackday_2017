Sir : Enclosed with this, you will receive several copies of correspondence in this town, for the present week ; also an official letter for the captain 
of any of our ships of war you may have in your port on your receiving this letter. It is impossible to say whether <a href="/results.php?tla=jsc" rel="adversary">Senor Castro</a>, the prefecto, and 
the general will attack <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> ; we expect such will be the case. I am just informed by Senor Arce, the general's secretary, who has just 
come in from the general's camp (St. John's), that the whole country will be raised to force <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a>, if they require so many. Senor Arce 
further says, the camp of the Americans is near Mr. Hartnell's rancho, on a high hill, with his flag flying ; of the latter I am not certain. As you are 
acquainted with this country, and its people, you will advise with our naval captains on the subject of sailing immediately for this port. If the vessel is 
not actually obliged to go elsewhere, it is my earnest desire she sails for Monterey on the receipt of this, although everything may end peaceably amongst us.

Believe me to be, yours, sincerely,

(Signed) <a href="/results.php?tla=tol" rel="me">Thomas O. Larkin</a>.
