<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='16'>16</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>. A change has come over the spirit of my dream. Dear old 
quire of yellow, coarse, Confederate home-made paper, here you are again. An age of anxiety and suffering 
has passed over my head since last I wrote and wept over your forlorn pages. 
</p><p>
My ideas of those last days are confused. The Martins left Columbia the Friday before I did, and Mammy, the 
negro woman, who had nursed them, refused to go with them. That daunted me. Then Mrs. McCord, who was to 
send her girls with me, changed her mind. She sent them up-stairs in her house and actually took away the staircase ; 
that was her plan. 
</p><p>
Then I met Mr. Christopher Hampton; arranging to take off his sisters. They were flitting, but were to go only 
as far as Yorkville. He said it was time to move on. <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> was at Orangeburg, barely a day's journey from Columbia, and had left a track as bare and blackened as a fire leaves on the prairies. 
</p><p>
So my time had come, too. My husband urged me to go home. He said Camden would be safe enough. They had 
no spite against that old town, as they have against Charleston and Columbia. Molly, weeping and wailing, came in 
while we were at table. Wiping her red-hot face with the cook's grimy apron, she said I ought to go among our own 
black people on the plantation ; they would take care of me 
better than any one else. So I agreed to go to Mulberry or the Hermitage plantation, and sent Lawrence down with a 
wagon-load of my valuables. 
</p><p>
Then a Miss Patterson called a refugee from Tennessee. She had been in a country overrun by Yankee invaders, and she described so graphically all the horrors to be endured by those subjected to fire and sword, rapine and 
plunder, that I was fairly scared, and determined to come here. This is a thoroughly out-of -all-routes place. And yet 
I can go to Charlotte, am half-way to Kate at Flat Rock, and there is no Federal army between me and Richmond. 
</p><p>
As soon as my mind was finally made up, we telegraphed to Lawrence, who had barely got to Camden in the 
wagon when the telegram was handed to him ; so he took the train and came back. Mr. Chesnut sent him with us to take 
care of the party. 
</p><p>
We thought that if the negroes were ever so loyal to us, they could not protect me from an army bent upon sweeping us from the face of the earth, and if they tried to do so so much the worse would it be for the poor things with 
their Yankee friends. I then left them to shift for themselves, as they are accustomed to do, and I took the same 
liberty. My husband does not care a fig for the property question, and never did. Perhaps, if he had ever known 
poverty, it would be different. He talked beautifully about it, as he always does about everything. I have told him 
often that, if at heaven's gate St. Peter would listen to him a while, and let him tell his own story, he would get in, and 
the angels might give him a crown extra. 
</p><p>
Now he says he has only one care that I should be safe, and not so harassed with dread ; and then there is his 
blind old father. A man, said he, " can always die like a patriot and a gentleman, with no fuss, and take it coolly. 
It is hard not to envy those who are out of all this, their difficulties ended those who have met death gloriously on the 
battle-field, their doubts all solved. One can but do his best and leave the result to a higher power."

After New Orleans, those vain, passionate, impatient little Creoles were forever committing suicide, driven to it by 
despair and " Beast " Butler. As we read these things, <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> said: " If they want to die, why not first kill 
Beast Butler, rid the world of their foe and be saved the trouble of murdering themselves? That practical way 
of removing their intolerable burden did not occur to them. I repeated this suggestive anecdote to our corps of generals 
without troops, here in this house, as they spread out their maps on my table where lay this quire of paper from which 
I write. Every man Jack of them had a safe plan to stop <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a>, if ---------
</p><p>
Even <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> were expected, but <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant</a> had double-teamed on <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> could not save his own how 
could he come to save us ? Read the list of the dead in those last battles around Richmond and Petersburg if you want 
to break your heart.

I took French leave of Columbia slipped away with out a word to anybody. Isaac Hayne and Mr. Chesnut 
came down to the Charlotte depot with me. Ellen, my maid, left her husband and only child, but she was willing 
to come, and, indeed, was very cheerful in her way of looking at it. 
</p><p>
" I wan travel roun wid Missis some time stid uh Molly goin all de time. 
</p><p>
A woman, fifty years old at least, and uglier than she was old, sharply rebuked my husband for standing at the 
car window for a last few words with me. She said rudely : " Stand aside, sir ! I want air ! With his hat off, and his 
grand air, my husband bowed politely, and said: " In one moment, madam ; I have something important to say to my wife." 
</p><p>
She talked aloud and introduced herself to every man, claiming his protection. She had never traveled alone be 
fore in all her life. Old age and ugliness are protective in some cases. She was ardently patriotic for a while. Then 
she was joined by her friend, a man as crazy as herself to get out of this. From their talk I gleaned she had been for 
years in the Treasury Department. They were about to cross the lines. The whole idea was to get away from the 
trouble to come down here. They were Yankees, but were they not spies? 
</p><p>
Here I am broken-hearted and an exile. And in such a place! We have bare floors, and for a feather-bed, pine 
table, and two chairs I pay $30 a day. Such sheets ! But fortunately I have some of my own. At the door, before I 
was well out of the hack, the woman of the house packed Lawrence back, neck and heels : she would not have him at 
any price. She treated him as Mr. F.'s aunt did Clenman in Little Dorrit. She said his clothes were too fine for a 
nigger. " His airs, indeed." Poor Lawrence was humble and silent. He said at last, " Miss Mary, send me back to 
Mars Jeems." I began to look for a pencil to write a note to my husband, but in the flurry could not find one. "Here 
is one," said Lawrence, producing one with a gold case. "Go away," she shouted, " I want no niggers here with 
gold pencils and airs. So Lawrence fled before the storm, but not before he had begged me to go back. He said, "if 
Mars Jeems knew how you was treated he d never be willing for you to stay here." 
</p><p>
The Martins had seen my, to them, well-known traveling case as the hack trotted up Main Street, and they arrived at 
this juncture out of breath. We embraced and wept. I kept my room. 
</p><p>
The Fants are refugees here, too; they are Virginians, and have been in exile since the second battle of Manassas. 
Poor things ; they seem to have been everywhere, and seen and suffered everything. They even tried to go back to 
their own house, but found one chimney only standing alone ; even that had been taken possession of by a Yankee, 
who had written his name upon it. 
</p><p>
The day I left home I had packed a box of flour, sugar, rice, and coffee, but my husband would not let me bring it. 
He said I was coming to a lahd of plenty unexplored North Carolina, where the foot of the Yankee marauder was 
unknown, and in Columbia they would need food. Now I have written for that box and many other things to be sent 
me by Lawrence, or I shall starve. 
</p><p>
The Middletons have come. How joyously I sprang to my feet to greet them. Mrs. Ben Rutledge described the 
hubbub in Columbia. Everybody was flying in every direction like a flock of swallows. She heard the enemy's 
guns booming in the distance. The train no longer runs from Charlotte to Columbia. Miss Middleton possesses her 
soul in peace. She is as cool, clever, rational, and entertaining as ever, and we talked for hours. Mrs. Reed was in 
a state of despair. I can well understand that sinking of mind and body during the first days as the abject misery of 
it all closes in upon you. I remember my suicidal tendencies when I first came here.
