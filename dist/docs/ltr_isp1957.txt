Sir 
</p><p>
The General Officers are now assembled at my Quarters, only wait for you to proceed on the business pointed out by his Excellency the Commander in Cheif As you was notified of this 
yesterday, I hoped they would not have been delay d on this account Should be glad you would attend immediately if possible as the 
Gentlemen think they cannot transact the business without you, & some of them are far from their Quarters, & consequently a delay will be very inconvenient for them.

I am Sir 
</p><p>
Your most Obed't & 
</p><p>
very Hble Serv't
