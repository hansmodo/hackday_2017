<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>My dear general</a>--From those happy ties of friendship by which you were
pleased to unite yourself with me, from the promises you so tenderly
made me when we parted at Fishkill, gave me such expectations of
hearing often from you, that complaints ought to be permitted to my
affectionate heart. Not a line from you, my dear, general, has yet
arrived into my hands, and though several ships from America, several
despatches from congress or the French minister, are safely brought to
France, my ardent hopes of getting at length a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>General Washington</a> have ever been unhappily disappointed: I cannot in any way
account for that bad luck, and when I remember that in those little
separations where I was but some days from you, the most friendly
letters, the most minute account of your circumstances, were kindly
written to me, I am convinced you have not neglected and almost
forgotten me for so long a time. I have, therefore, to complain of
fortune, of some mistake or neglect in acquainting you that there was
an opportunity, of anything; indeed, but what could injure the sense I
have of your affection for me. Let me beseech you, my dear general, by
that mutual, tender, and experienced friendship in which, I have put an
immense portion of my happiness, to be very exact in inquiring for
occasions, and never to miss those which may convey to me letters that
I shall be so much pleased to receive.
</p><p>
Inclosed I send to your excellency the copy of my letters to congress,
which, in concert with <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague friend met'>Mr. Franklin</a>'s longer despatches, will give you
a sketch of European intelligence. Contrary winds have much delayed an
expedition which I think should have been undertaken much sooner: the
kings of France and Spain seem desirous of carrying it on before the
winter; it may be, however, deferred till next spring, and the siege of
Gibraltar would be the only land expedition for the present campaign.
In a few weeks time, when West India successes may be compared to those
in Europe, my gazettes and predictions will have a greater degree of
certainty, but one must not be a conjuror to see that England is in
such a way that one may defy her to get up again, and that a happy
peace, blessed with American independence, will, in this or the ensuing
campaign, be the certain effect of the present war.
</p><p>
As my private circumstances are somewhat interesting to your
friendship, I will tell you, my dear general, that since my last letter
I have hardly quitted this place, where head-quarters had been fixed. I
was to disembark with the grenadiers forming the vanguard, and am,
therefore, one of the first who will land on the English shore. The
king's own regiment of dragoons, which he gave me on my return, was to
embark at Brest, and join us a few days after the landing. From <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='co-worker met'>Count D'Estaing</a>'s expedition on the American coasts, the nation raises great
expectations, and very impatiently waits for intelligence. How unhappy
I am to find myself so far from you on such an occasion you will easily
conceive. The impression of sorrow such a thought gives me cannot be
alleviated but by the sense I have that the general opinion of the turn
warlike operations will take this campaign, the ties of my duty towards
my own country, where my services had been employed for the expedition
against England, and the hope I entertained of being here more useful
to the United States, had not left me the choice of the part I should
take for this campaign. I hope, my dear sir, you will agree in opinion with me.
</p><p>
Whatever may be <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='co-worker met'>Count D'Estaing</a>'s success in America, it will bring on
new projects and operations. My ideas I laid before your excellency at
Fishkill; but permit me to tell you again how earnestly I wish to join
you. Nothing could make me so delighted as the happiness of finishing
the war under your orders. That, I think, if asked by you, will be
granted to congress and your excellency. But be certain, my dear
general, that in any situation, in any case, let me act as a French or
as an American officer, my first wish, my first pleasure, will be to
serve again with you. However happy I am in France, however well
treated by my country and king, I have taken such a habit of being with
you, I am tied to you, to America, to my fellow soldiers by such an
affection, that the moment when I shall sail for your country will be
one of the most wished for and the happiest in my life.
</p><p>
From an American newspaper I find that a certain English intelligence
had been propagated through the United States, that, at the head of
fifteen hundred officers or non-commissioned officers, I was going to
embark for America, and that, with soldiers of your army embodied under
them, I wanted to teach military discipline throughout the "American
army". However remote I am from thinking of teaching my own masters,
and however distant from such views was that command in France, whose
end you very well know, I could not help taking it as a reflection on
the "American army". The English troops may remember that on some
particular occasions I have not had to lament the want of discipline
and spirit in the troops which I had the honour to command. Whilst we
have but the same British army to fight with, we need not be looking
out for any other improvement than the same qualities which have often
enabled my fellow American soldiers to give, instead of receiving,
pretty good lessons to an enemy, whose justly-reputed courage added a
new reputation to American bravery and military conduct.
</p><p>
The above article, my dear general, I beg you will have "printed in the
several newspapers".
</p><p>
As there is but a little time to write before the sailing of the
vessel, I cannot call to mind all the friends I have in the army,
unless your excellency is pleased to make them a thousand compliments
from one who heartily loves them, and whose first wish is to be again
in their company.
</p><p>
I congratulate you, my dear general, on the spirited expedition of
Stony Point, and am glad it has added, a new lustre to our arms.
</p><p>
Be so kind, my dear friend, as to present my best respects to your
lady. Mine begs leave to be kindly remembered to you and to her.
Thousand assurances of friendship wait from me on your family.
</p><p>
Oh! my dear general, how happy I should be to embrace you again!
</p><p>
With such affection as is above all expressions any language may
furnish, I have the honour to be, very respectfully, &c.
</p>
