My Betrothed Ellen:--Your letter of June 4th reached me on Wednesday last. The mail was due early in the evening, but did not arrive until very late. I was anxious, however, to hear from you and so posted myself in a good situation and so great was the rush, I waited until near midnight before I could get my letters. I am very much pleased with your letter and I am only sorry I cannot write you something that will please you as well. About three weeks ago I received one from my uncle dated and mailed in December last. Your letter was written on the fourth of June and not mailed until the 16th. If it had been mailed a day or two after it was written, it would have reached me two weeks sooner. Whenever you have a letter written and Prizer is not ready to send one, you can direct it plainly to Sonora, Tuolumne County, California, and drop it in the post office immediately.

Yesterday I received a letter from our old friend, Cale Thornbury, dated June 18th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1851">1851</a>. He was then on the Klamath River near Oregon. I believe he is doing very well, but the Indians are very troublesome in that neighborhood. He had just received a letter from home and wrote as if he were in high spirits. Although I have not been as successful as I could have wished, I have made something, and methinks I hear Hope whispering all is well.

Nearly every steamer that arrives now brings a great many ladies. We are having beautiful moonlight evenings and were we together who could tell the pleasures of one evening walk? I would have ten thousand things
to tell you of, and twice ten thousand questions to ask and have answered.

You speak of a panorama of a whaling voyage exhibiting in West Chester. Well do I remember the last panoramic exhibition I visited. It was of the Mammoth Cave, and other pictures. On a Saturday, I think. I know it was a beautiful moonlight evening. I know we had a long walk after we left the hall. I also know that we were happy. And, oh, for a return of those glorious, happy hours. That was not long before I left. Do you remember the last Sunday I was in Chester County? Well do I remember it. Cad and Prizer, you and I were at Unionville. I believe your equanimity was a little disturbed at my incidentally mentioning my determination of coming to California. But I did not think I could start so soon after. Ellen, I do wish you were here.

And now, dear Ellen, I must close by subscribing myself, as ever devoutly yours,
