Sir, 
</p><p>
Colonel Harrison, who has acted as my secretary 
since the beginning of 1776, has accepted an honorable and profitable civil appointment in the State of 
Maryland, and is gone to enjoy it. The circle of my 
acquaintance does not furnish a character, that would 
be more pleasing to me as a successor to hun, than 
yourself. I make you the first offer, therefore, of the 
vacant office, and should be happy in your acceptance 
of it. The pay is one hundred dollars a month ; the 
rations those of a Lieutenant-Colonel in the army, 
which in fact are additional, as the value thereof is 
received in money. No perquisites appertain to the office. The secretary lives as I do, is at little expense while he is in my family, or when absent on 
my business, and is in the highest confidence and estimation from the nature of his office. I mention these 
things for your information, and shall be happy in a 
speedy and favorable answer, being, with great esteem 
and regard, &c.
