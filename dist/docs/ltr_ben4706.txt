DEAR FRIEND : I have heard of an account you lately received from Russia of some discovery of an ancient sepulchre 
in the frontiers of that country. I wish I could see that account. In the meantime I send you a passage I have met 
with in Herodotus, that most ancient historian, concerning 
the sepulchres of the Scythian kings, which may possibly 
throw some light on this discovery. The Boristhenes, you 
know, is a river that takes its rise in the north, and empties 
itself into the Euxine Sea. I am, as ever yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

The Sepulchres of the Scythian kings are in the country of 
the Gerrhians, where the Borysthenes is first known to be 
navigable. When their king dies, they dig a great hole in the 
ground, of a quadrangular form, and having received the 
body covered with wax, they open and cleanse the belly, filling the space with bruised cypress, incense, seeds of parsley, 
and aries. And after they have sewed up the belly again, 
they carry the body in a chariot to another province ; where, 
those who receive it imitate the royal Scythians in the following custom: They cut off part of one ear: shave their 
heads: wound themselves on the arms, forehead, and nose; 
and pierce the left hand with an arrow. Having done thus, 
they accompany the chariot to another district; and this 
manner is observed in every province ; till having carried the 
dead body of the king through all his dominions, they bury 
him in the country of the Gerrhians, who inhabit the remotest 
parts of the kingdom. Here they lay him in the sepulchre, 
upon a bed encompassed on all sides with spears, which they 
cover with timber, and spread a canopy over the whole monument. In the spaces that remain vacant, they place one of 
the king's concubines strangled; with a cup-bearer, a cook, 
a groom, a waiter, a messenger, certain horses, and some of 
all things necessary. To these they add cups of gold, because 
silver and brass are not used amongst them. This done, 
they throw up the earth with great diligence, and endeavor 
to raise the mount as high as possibly they can. Herodotus, Book IV.
