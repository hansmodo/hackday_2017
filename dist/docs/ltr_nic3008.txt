SIR, 
</p><p>
In consequence of your letter of the 18th instant, 
we have sent out our small armed vessel with orders 
to Captain Whipple to relinquish the voyage to Bermuda, and to prolong his cruise for the packet to 
the 6th day of October. 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your advice I have communicated 
the proposed adventure to Bayonne to the Congress, 
and most heartily wish it may be pursued, as the 
ability and integrity of De Ville are perfectly relied 
upon here. The following extract from Governor 
Trumbull's letter to me, of the 18th instant, will in 
form you of his sentiments respecting the enterprise, 
and his reasons for declining to take a part in it. 
</p><p>
"In mine of the 11th instant, in answer to your 
esteemed favor of the 9th, I acquainted you with my 
purpose to lay your letter before my Council, on 
Thursday, the 14th, which I did. They approve your 
proposition ; the way appears to them promising at 
the same time we have advanced money so largely 
for that article, and have great reason to expect a 
supply in a similar method, that they judge it not 
expedient for us to proceed further at this time. It 
is an article which requires our attention, and wish 
every method, that appears probable to obtain it, may 
be pursued. I hope General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> will hearken 
to your application, and suitably encourage and promote your generous design." 
</p><p>
The time for which the combined army was enlisted being nearly expired, it is of great importance 
to provide some method of reenlisting them, in order 
to keep up a sufficient force to restrain the enemy 
during the winter, and to take the field in the 
spring. My anxious concern on this head, which appears to me to be of the last importance, will excuse 
my suggesting to you the necessity of giving it the 
earliest attention, as I greatly fear difficulties may 
arise which will require time to obviate, and I can 
safely assure you of the concurrence of this Colony 
in every prudent measure for the effecting this most 
essential point. I am, with great truth and respect, 
Sir, your Excellency's most humble and 
</p><p>
Most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=nic" rel="me">NICHOLAS COOKE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Since the sailing of the small vessel, I 
observe, in the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> papers, that a packet is 
arrived there from Falmouth, which I take to be the 
same that Captain Whipple was sent after. If so, the opportunity is lost ; but by extending his cruise 
a little longer, he may have a chance for the August packet.
