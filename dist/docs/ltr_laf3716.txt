My dear General, 
</p><p>
Inclosed you will find some numbers, a copy of 
which I have kept, and which contain some names 
that may probably occur in our correspondence. I 
need not tell you, my dear General, that I shall be 
happy in giving you every intelligence in my power, 
and reminding you of the most affectionate friend you 
can ever have. The goodness you had to take upon 
yourself the communicating to the Virginia army the 
approbation of Congress, appears much better to me 
than my writing to the scattered parts of the body I 
had the honor to command. Give me leave, my dear 
General, to recall to your memory the peculiar situation of the troops, who, being already in Virginia, 
were deprived of the month's pay given to the others. 
Should it be possible to do something for them, it 
would give them great satisfaction. 
</p><p>
I will have the honor to write to you from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, my dear General, and should be very sorry to think 
this is my last letter. Accept, however, once more the homage of the respect and of the affection that 
render me forever, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant and tender friend, 
</p><p>
Lafayette.
</p><p>
P. S. I beg you will present my respects to Mrs. 
Washington, and my compliments to George and the 
family. Will you be so kind, my dear General, as to 
remember me to Mr. and Mrs. Morris ? 
</p>
