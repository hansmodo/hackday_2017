My Own Dear Ellen:--For the last two mails previous I received nothing from you. Your truly welcome letter of August 31st came at length and I cannot express upon paper the happiness it brought me. Prizer, I suppose, detained it in his possession, for his letter was dated later than yours.
</p><p>
I was in hopes that the villainous report of our supposed murder would not reach you, for I well knew the distress it would put you all in. I wrote by the first mail after the occurrence, denying the story altogether, so that it must only have been a little over two weeks from the time you heard the first story until you read my letter contradicting it. My poor mother worried worst of all. After hearing the story she could not give full credit to the contradiction until she read it over my own signature.
</p><p>
I know you must have been harassed between doubt and uncertainty when you read that the proprietors, Messrs. Gunn and Christman, had been so brutally murdered. And I am told that some of my friends really concluded at once that I had shuffled off this mortal coil, but thanks to a kind Providence, it was not true and I am still here and permitted to indulge in the pleasing task of conversing, though at a distance, with her whom I hope ere long to make 'my better half.' Theodore's knowledge of the way in which stories are often raised and circulated in California must have been a great consolation to you.
</p><p>
I am afraid that you make the picture of life in California a little darker than what it really is. Bad
as it is, and notwithstanding the great number of gamblers and other worthless persons within our borders, there are many, very many, high-minded and honorable men in our midst and if a man is quiet and sober he can generally avoid all quarrels in which rowdies and drunken men always see fit to draw the bowie knife and revolver. And I believe if men had their sweethearts, wives and children out here, we should have as good order and as much protection to life and property as in any new country. Indeed if you were only out here with me, I am sure that we would both like it so well that we would not wish to return until we had made our fortune.
</p><p>
I see by a late Record, which I have received, that Miss Bradshaw has set sail on the sea of matrimony. I believe she has chosen a very worthy young man and one who will make a good husband.
</p><p>
You and I, dear Ellen, have now been corresponding a good while, and as yet, with the exception of an indirect allusion to the subject now and then, we have said but little in regard to marriage. We are pledged to each other, and I think we may just as well have a little more to say about the matter, and I should like to hear your views and opinions in regard thereto. I suppose your parents are satisfied with me or they would have objected to my visits while in West Chester and our correspondence since my departure. If I could establish myself on my return, I do not see any very strong objections to our getting married soon after. If all this should turn out as I hope it may, I should look upon that as a very happy day. This is a matter of some importance and I think we know each other well enough to canvass it thoroughly. I hope you will write me fully and freely on this subject in your next
letter. It is a matter in which I begin to feel deeply interested.
</p><p>
My experience thus far through the world has been of a rather rough nature, and my ramblings have taught me to wish for a home, a domestic fireside, at which I could stop with pleasure. Dear Ellen, I wish you were here now. If it were not for the long distance and the difficult way, and the objections others would raise to the proposition, I would at once propose some means to get you to join me in this place. I am building a house in a pleasant part of the city, which will be finished in about ten days, and which I think I can rent for forty or fifty dollars per month, and other suitable domestic arrangements could be made, I think, without any serious difficulty.
</p><p>
A few evenings since I jokingly told Mrs. Gunn that I was going to send for my sweetheart to come out here. She laughed heartily about it and asked me if I didn't want a recommendation! I told her I did, and she and Mr. Gunn each wrote me one, which I am enclosing. They may perhaps afford you pleasantry.
</p>
