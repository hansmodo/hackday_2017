DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here last night from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. Having 
given <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> a little time to recollect himself, 
I renewed my remonstrances on the necessity and 
propriety of sending you more than one brigade of 
the three he had detained with him, and finally prevailed upon him to give orders for Glover's, in addition to Patterson's brigade, to march this way. As 
it was thought conducive to expedition to send the 
troops by water, as far as it could be done, I pro 
cured all the vessels that could be had at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> fit 
for the purpose, but could not get more than sufficient to take in Patterson's brigade. It was embarked the 7th instant, and I expected would have been 
here before this, but the wind has been contrary, 
though they must, in all probability, be here to-day. 
General Glover's brigade marched at the same time 
on the east side of the river, the road being much 
better there than on this side. I am this moment 
informed that one sloop, with a part of Patterson's, 
is arrived, and that the others are in sight. They 
will immediately proceed by water to King's Ferry, 
and thence take the shortest route to you. 
</p><p>
I am pained, beyond expression, to inform your Excellency that, on my arrival here, I find every thing 
has been neglected and deranged by <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, 
and that the two brigades, Poor's and Learned's, still 
remained here and on the other side the river at 
<a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. Colonel Warner's militia, I am told, have 
been drawn to <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, to aid in an expedition 
against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, which, it seems, is at this time the 
hobby-horse with <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>. Not the least attention has been paid to my order, in your name, fora detachment of one thousand men from the troops 
hitherto stationed at that post. Every thing is sacrificed to the whim of taking <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
The two brigades of Poor and Learned, it appears, 
would not march for want of money and necessaries, 
several of the regiments having received no pay for 
six or eight months past. There has been a high 
mutiny among the former on this account, in which a 
Captain killed a man, and was shot himself by his 
comrade. These difficulties, for want of proper management, have stopped the troops from proceeding. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> has been the only man who has 
done any thing towards removing them ; but, for want 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>'s cooperation., has not been able 
to effect it. He has only been able to prevail with 
Learned's brigade to agree to march to Goshen, in 
hopes, by getting them once on the go, to get them 
to continue their march. On coming here, I immediately sent for Colonel Bayley, who now commands 
Learned's brigade ; and have gotten him to engage 
for carrying the brigade on to head-quarters as fast 
as possible. This he expects to effect by means of 
live or six thousand dollars, which <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> 
was kind enough to borrow for me, and which Colonel 
Bayley thinks will keep the men in good humor till 
they join you. They marched this morning towards 
Goshen. 
</p><p>
I shall, as soon as possible, see General Poor, and 
do every thing in my power to get him along. I 
hope I shall be able to succeed. 
</p><p>
The plan I before laid having been totally deranged, a new one has become necessary. It is now 
too late to send Warner's militia. By the time they 
get to you, their term of service would be out. The 
motive for sending them, which was to give you a 
speedy reenforcement, has, by the past delay, been 
superseded. By <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>'s advice, I have 
sent an order, in the most emphatical terms, to General 
Putnam, immediately to despatch all the Continental 
troops under him to your assistance ; and to detain 
the militia instead of them. 
</p><p>
My opinion is, that the only present use for troops 
in this quarter is to protect the country from the 
depredations of little plundering parties, and for carrying on the works necessary for the defence of the 
river. Nothing more ought to be thought of. It is 
only wasting time, and misapplying men, to employ 
them in a fancied parade against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; for in 
this it will undoubtedly terminate. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is no 
object, if it could be taken ; and, to take it, would 
require more men than could be spared from more 
substantial purposes. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>'s ideas coincide with mine. He thinks that there is no need of 
more Continental troops here than a few to give a 
spur to the militia in working upon the fortifications. 
In pursuance of this, I have given the directions be 
fore mentioned ; if <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> attends to them, 
the troops under him may be with you nearly as 
early as any of the others (though he has unluckily 
marched them down to Tarrytown), and General Glover's brigade, when it gets up, will be more than sufficient to answer the purposes of this post. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency agrees with me in opinion, it 
will be well to send instant directions to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> to pursue the objects I have mentioned; for I 
doubt whether he will attend to any thing I shall 
say, notwithstanding it comes in the shape of a positive order. I fear, unless you interpose, the works 
here will go on so feebly, for want of men, that they 
will not be completed in time ; whereas, it appears to 
me of the utmost importance they should be pushed 
with the utmost vigor. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> will do 
every thing in his power. I wish <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> 
was recalled from the command of this post, and <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> would accept it. The blunders and ca 
prices of the former are endless. 
</p><p>
Believe me, Sir, nobody can be more impressed 
with the importance of forwarding the reinforcements 
coming to you, with all speed, nor could anybody 
have endeavoured more to promote it than I have 
done ; but the ignorance of some, and the design of 
others, have been almost insuperable obstacles. I am 
very unwell; but I shall not spare myself to get 
things immediately in a proper train; and, for that 
purpose, intend, unless I receive other orders from yon, 
to continue with the troops in the progress of their 
march. As soon as I get General Poor's brigade in 
march, I shall proceed to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. I have the honor to be, with much regard and 
respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
