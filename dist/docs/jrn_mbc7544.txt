<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='11'>11th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. In full conclave to-night, the drawingroom crowded with Judges, Governors, Senators, Generals, 
Congressmen. They were exalting John C. Calhoun's hospitality. He allowed everybody to stay all night who chose 
to stop at his house. An ill-mannered person, on one occasion, refused to attend family prayers. <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel=''>Mr. Calhoun</a> said 
to the servant, Saddle that man's horse and let him go. From the traveler Calhoun would take no excuse for the 
" Deity offended." I believe in <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel=''>Mr. Calhoun's</a> hospitality, but not in his family prayers. <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel=''>Mr. Calhoun's</a> piety was of 
the most philosophical type, from all accounts.

The latest news is counted good news; that is, the last man who left Washington tells us that <a href='/results.php?tla=wls' rel=''>Seward</a> is in the 
ascendency. He is thought to be the friend of peace. 
</p><p>
The man did say, however, that " that serpent <a href='/results.php?tla=wls' rel=''>Seward</a> is in the ascendency just now."

Harriet Lane has eleven suitors. One is described as likely to win, or he would be likely to win, except that he is 
too heavily weighted. He has been married before and goes about with children and two mothers. There are limits 
beyond which ! Two mothers-in-law !

Mr. Ledyard spoke to <a href='/results.php?tla=mtl' rel=''>Mrs. Lincoln</a> in behalf of a door keeper who almost felt he had a vested right, having been 
there since Jackson's time ; but met with the same answer ; she had brought her own girl and must economize. Mr. Ledyard thought the twenty thousand (and little enough it 
is) was given to the President of these United States to enable him to live in proper style, and to maintain an establishment of such dignity as befits the head of a great nation. It is an infamy to economize with the public money 
and to put it into one's private purse. Mrs. Browne was walking with me when we were airing our indignation 
against <a href='/results.php?tla=mtl' rel=''>Mrs. Lincoln</a> and her shabby economy. The Herald says three only of the elite Washington families attended 
the Inauguration Ball.

The Judge has just come in and said : "Last night, after Dr. Boykin left on the cars, there came a telegram 
that his little daughter, Amanda, had died suddenly." In some way he must have known it beforehand. He changed 
so suddenly yesterday, and seemed so careworn and unhappy. He believes in clairvoyance, magnetism, and all 
that. Certainly, there was some terrible foreboding of this kind on his part. 
</p><p>
Tuesday. Now this, they say, is positive : Fort Sumer is to be released and we are to have no war." After 
all, far too good to be true. Mr. Browne told us that, at one of the peace intervals (I mean intervals in the interest 
of peace) , <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> flew through Baltimore, locked up in an express car. He wore a Scotch cap. 
</p><p>
We went to the Congress. Governor Cobb, who presides over that august body, put James Chesnut in the 
chair, and came down to talk to us. He told us why the pay of Congressmen was fixed in secret session, and why the 
amount of it was never divulged to prevent the lodginghouse and hotel people from making their bills of a size to 
cover it all. " The bill would be sure to correspond with the pay," he said. 
</p><p>
In the hotel parlor we had a scene. Mrs. Scott was describing <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a>, who is of the cleverest Yankee type. 
She said "Awfully ugly, even grotesque in appearance, the kind who are always at the corner stores, sitting on 
boxes, whittling sticks, and telling stories as funny as they are vulgar." Here I interposed: " But Stephen A. 
Douglas said one day to Mr. Chesnut, <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> is the hardest fellow to handle I have ever encountered yet. Mr. Scott is from California, and said <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> is "an utter American specimen, coarse, rough, and strong; a good-natured, kind creature; as pleasant-tempered as he is clever, and if this country can be joked and laughed out of 
its rights he is the kind-hearted fellow to do it. Now if there is a war and it pinches the Yankee pocket instead of 
filling it Here a shrill voice came from the next room (which opened upon the one we were in by folding doors thrown 
wide open) and said: " Yankees are no more mean and stingy than you are. People at the North are just as good 
as people at the South." The speaker advanced upon us in great wrath. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Scott apologized and made some smooth, polite remark, though evidently much embarrassed. But the vinegar face and curly pate refused to receive any concessions, and replied : "That comes with a very bad grace after what 
you were saying, and she harangued us loudly for several minutes. Some one in the other room giggled outright, 
but we were quiet as mice. Nobody wanted to hurt her 
feelings. She was one against so many. If I were at the North, I should expect them to belabor us, and should hold 
my tongue. We separated North from South because of in compatibility of temper. We are divorced because we 
have hated each other so. If we could only separate, a " separation a I agreable," as the French say it, and not have a horrid fight for divorce. 
</p><p>
The poor exile had already been insulted, she said. She was playing " Yankee Doodle " on the piano before 
breakfast to soothe her wounded spirit, and the Judge came in and calmly requested her to " leave out the Yankee 
while she played the Doodle." The Yankee end of it did not suit our climate, he said; was totally out of place and 
had got out of its latitude. 
</p><p>
A man said aloud : This war talk is nothing. It will soon blow over. Only a fuss gotten up by that Charleston 
clique." Mr. Toombs asked him to show his passports, for a man who uses such language is a suspicious character.
