<p> Dear Grand daughter your letter came to hand a few days ago dated July 29th, ut I did not receive it till August 2nd. I would like to have answered immediately but was not well when I don&#8217;t feel well I can&#8217;t write at all. I am nearly in that condition today but I am alone today, Nele has gone to church and Major is out hunting so I concluded to try and have a little talk with you all. It gives me so much comfort to hear from you all I can&#8217;t tell you how much I can&#8217;t keep my end and respond to all the letters I receive So I fear that soon I will have more. I often think while writing that this one will be the last but we can&#8217;t tell anything about that. I can almost hear Ruthie abusing me for not answering her nice long letter but never mind. Perhaps I will get to feeling well some of these nice days and reply. I was so proud of you all when I learned how well you all had done. I know your Papa and Mama feels that their efforts and desires are not in vain. Even Hellen and Frank that manly little man are going to school. Hellen I have 3 pencils in my pocket, I wish you had them!!
<p> What did they do with that man that tried to kill his own daughter they will give a term in San Quentin.
<p>Well write and tell me things are running financially and otherwise did you work much in the fruit?
<p> Well, we are all well so far as I know. Mg. Hamilton returned home the first of this month. Minnie, Kat, Evy and Marcus came with her. They are stopping with Lou. Luther H. took his vacation in Los Angeles. The man that Ges Hopper works for put a stove in [unintelligible] and George and another clerk is in charge. Everything here is moving along nicely, the farmers have done well, the oil industry is advancing new, wells are coming in.
<p> I feel that all are doing something but me. Now I hope these lines will find you all well and in good spirits. I find that my hand is giving out. Do write to me soon, while I remain your worthy Grandpa. Goodby
