DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for introducing me to the Knowledge of M. le Marquis d'Ecrammeville, who appears a very 
amiable Man, with an excellent Understanding. 
</p><p>
Abraham Mansword's Advice to his Countrymen is very 
good. I hope they will have more of it. 
</p><p>
Pray inform me by a Line, whether M. Le Roy has paid 
for the Ephemerides in my Behalf. If not, I will upon Sight 
discharge the amount, by paying your Draft upon me. And 
I request they may be continually sent me as long as you are 
concerned in them. 
</p><p>
Go on to do good with your inlighten'd Pen, and by instructing them & inciting them to Virtue deserve well of 
Mankind & of their common Father. 
</p><p>
With sincere and great Esteem, I am, my Dear Friend, 
Yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B FRANKLIN.
