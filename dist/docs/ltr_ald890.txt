DEAR Free Trader --From the mouth of the Missouri to this place the banks of the river are high and often precipitous and rocky, though the valley is sometimes two miles wide, and the water is constantly wearing away the soil of the bottoms, which are only a deposit of the stream at some former period. This makes the Missouri a muddy stream, resembling the water in a puddle after a shower; but after being allowed to settle a short time, the water is sweet and wholesome. A few miles above Independence, we pass the mouth of the Kansas, and on that side up to Council Bluffs, perhaps higher, is the Indian country, their claim to which is not yet extinguished by the government; and on their side you see no sign of civilization except at Fort Leavenworth, up as far as we have come, while the opposite or north side of the river is a fine farming country, well settled a short distance on the bluff. Fort Leavenworth stands upon the bank, perhaps an hundred rods from the river, and is like an oasis in the wilderness of prairie and cottonwood of the bottoms, with its neat barracks and surrounding brick buildings.

The tedium of the steamboat was at length relieved by a view of the pretty and thrifty town of St. Joseph on the 19th, about four o'clock p.m., after a ten days' confinement, from St. Louis. It is situated upon a level plot, in a kind of amphitheatre, high ridges of broken prairie in the rear, with the river in front. It is the county seat of Buchanan County, has a fine spacious courthouse, two or three churches, a population of two thousand souls, twenty-one mercantile stores, mechanics in proportion, three steam flouring mills and a fourth under contract; three sawmills, and I was informed that fifty-four brick and ninety frame houses were erected last season. Twelve thousand hogs were slaughtered here last fall, and large quantities of bacon, hemp, and tobacco are brought in from the surrounding country. It is only five years since the town was surveyed and laid out, and it promises to be a place of much importance. It is already one of the prominent starting places for California and Oregon emigrants.
</p><p>
At St. Louis the emigrants have been egregiously imposed on by false representations as to the capability of furnishings outfits here. We were told that the number of emigrants was so great that supplies could not be obtained, scarcely at any price; that the citizens were sending down the river for provisions; that board was seven dollars a week at the hotels, &c. We were, therefore, induced to lay in our bacon, a common article, at 5 3/4c. per pound; our flour at
</p><p>
$4.50 per bbl.; our bread at 5 and pay 30c. freight. We found on our arrival that the most beautiful bacon could be had and in any quantity at 4 to 5.; flour at $4 per bbl.; and board ranged from $2 to $4 per week at the hotels.
</p><p>
Cattle and mules, which had also been represented as being enormously high, can be had, the former at $45 to $55 per yoke and the latter from $50 to $70 each. Other supplies can be had on quite reasonable terms, and I should advise all who are coming not to buy in St. Louis but to complete their outfit here.
</p><p>
We found on our arrival that Mr. Green's company had decided to move up the river to Fort Kearny, ninety-six miles The season is backward, and it will probably be ten or fourteen days before the grass will allow the emigrants to start. By going to Fort Kearny they avoid crossing the Platte. A good military road extends through the interior; the streams are all bridged, and they are forty-five miles advanced on their journey, having the advantage of settlements so far. We found the first South Bend, Indiana, company here, but on the point of moving to Fort Kearny; and I think many men will adopt the same course.
</p><p>
This will make a division in the main body, so that a much wider range will be had for our cattle. My cattle, with those of Mr. Cutting, are thirty miles in the country awaiting our orders. Mr. Cutting arrived yesterday and we have despatched Mr. Smith for our cattle, having determined to take the Fort Kearny route. We intend to leave here on Tuesday. We have to make the melancholy record of the death of Mr. Zeluff, a member of Mr. Green's company. He was taken with diarrhea and suffered it to run without attention six days, when vomiting and cramps set in and terminated his existence in a few hours. That company left here few hours before our arrival and went out five miles, when Mr. Zeluff died, and yesterday they stopped to bury him.
</p><p>
Messrs. Morril and Thorn, who are attached to our mess, went on with Mr. Fredenburg's wagon in the Dayton (Green's) company, and we expect to overtake them at the Fort, and then we intend to unite with Captain Tutt's company of South Bend, all old friends of mine
</p><p>
There are here, and in this vicinity, from two thousand to twenty-four hundred men, but not over three thousand at this time. Every steamboat brings its hundreds, and the next ten days may swell the number to five or six thousand.
</p><p>
I have ventured to predict ten thousand as the probable number who will attempt to cross the plains. It may exceed that calculation, but from present indications twenty and thirty thousand is far beyond the mark

In the motley crowd assembled at this point, you see every variety of costume and arrangements for traveling according to the taste and ability of the emigrants. It seems to be a general disposition to set fashion at defiance, or rather it is fashionable to be unfashionable. As a general custom, however, a check or woolen shirt, a Mexican broadbrim, small crown, white or brown wool hat, high boots reaching up on the knee, as uncomfortable as can be made á la seven league boots of Peter Schlemihl, is the general character of your imaginary Croesus. Then others of more refined taste, who never dreamed perhaps of such exquisiteness at home, have cultivated a most precious pair of mustaches and whiskers, while others are trying to coax a pair to grow without success, á la Baboonia, and with a finer display of bowie knives and revolvers may hide the trembling of a coward heart. And these men, most of whom are strangers to hardships, are about launching forth upon a sea of toil, where their habits must change and where all their comforts, aside from providential contingencies, depend upon themselves, their sagacity and ingenuity. They must drive and attend their own teams, repair all "breaks," wash and mend their own clothes, bake their own cakes, cook their own meat, brown and boil their own coffee, in short, be teamster, carpenter, blacksmith, shoemaker, tailor, cook and bottle-washer all in one. Lawyers, physicians, counter-jumpers, ladies' man, dandy, think of this and weep, because the gold won't come to you, but is obstinately bent on having you go to it at the sacrifice of so much paste blacking, cologne water, gin slings, and mint juleps.
</p><p>
The women are all grinning at the thought of what a fist you will make on the bank of a puddle washing your own clothes without soap, or trying to stop up a hole in your shirt with a darning needle; and I fancy I hear my own better half, exclaiming half triumphantly, as I am sweating over the fire roasting coffee, with buffalo chips, after a rain, "It's good enough for you; you might have staid at home instead of going off on a wild goose expedition. You'll find
out that women are worth something after all." Never mind, boys--" de gustibus non," &.

(That last line is rather long and doesn't rhyme exactly, but there may be truth in it if not poetry.)
</p><p>
Another way of recognizing a gold digger here is by seeing a six-foot biped, with his legs doubled up so they won't drag, astride of a mule about as large as a good-sized calf. I saw several today, and mean to make drawings as soon as I get leisure. I gave one of the most Quixotic three cheers and a hurrah; he put spurs to the animal and disappeared in the course of fifteen minutes behind a hill about ten rods distant.
</p><p>
Almost every boat reports one case of cholera, but in every instance it seems to have been brought on by imprudence or neglect; you may set this down as certain; and there is no case here among those who take proper care of themselves. We are advised that large numbers of foreigners are on their way to California, and I have heard but one determination expressed by our emigrants, and that is to assist our government to prevent foreigners of all nations from digging and carrying off the gold. They say, too, that if the government will do nothing, they will organize among themselves to prevent it. A militia formed from the emigrants will be an efficient force; for every man goes well armed and provided with ammunition, and will form no mean army of themselves with a proper organization.--Added to this, they are almost entirely composed of energetic, well-informed, resolute law-and-order men, who have characters at home and who cannot at once depart from the habits and mental training from childhood of a civilized and moral community. I have scarcely seen a rowdy or intoxicated man among the emigrants--not one in five hundred. It is emphatically the case here that you cannot judge the character of a man by his dress. The check shirt, the broadbrimmed hat, the quaint coat or wrapper, and the everlasting boots, reduce all to a level in appearance--the man of science, the scholar, the merchant, the lawyer, the farmer, the laborer, or the dandy.
</p><p>
It remains to be seen how well we shall sustain the sentiments that we have been educated in. I shall endeavor to keep you advised
of our movements from this place and after we get off of all mail routes; we shall embrace every opportunity of sending an account of our doings, with, perhaps a sprinkle of some of our "sayings."
</p><p>
Yours truly,
