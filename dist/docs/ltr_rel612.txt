Mr. E. A. Pollard, 104 West Baltimore St., Baltimore, Md.
</p><p>
Dear Sir:  I return you my thanks for the compliment paid me by your
proposition to write a history of my life.  It is a hazardous
undertaking to publish the life of any one while living, and there
are but few who would desire to read a true history of themselves.
Independently of the few national events with which mine has been
connected, it presents little to interest the general reader, nor do
I know where to refer you for the necessary materials.  All my private,
as well as public, records have been destroyed or lost, except what
is to be found in published documents, and I know of nothing available
for the purpose.  Should you, therefore, determine to undertake the
work, you must rely upon yourself, as my time is so fully occupied
that I am unable to promise you any assistance.
</p><p>
                    Very respectfully,
</p><p>
                        <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>
