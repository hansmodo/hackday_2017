As we have no longer a minister Mr. Gierlow having gone to Europe and no papers, I am in 
danger of forgetting the days of the week, as well as those of the month ; but I am positive that yesterday 
was Sunday because I heard the Sunday-School bells, and Friday I am sure was the Fourth, because 
I heard the national salute fired. I must remember that to find my dates by.

Well, last night being Sunday, a son of Captain Hooper, who died in the Fort Jackson fight, having 
just come from <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, stopped here on his way to Jackson, to tell us the news, or rather to see 
Charlie, and told us afterwards. He says a boat from Mobile reached the city Saturday evening, and 
the captain told Mr. La Noue that he brought 
an extra from the former place, containing news of <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan's</a> surrender with his entire army, his 
being mortally wounded, and the instant departure of a French, and English, man-of-war, from 
Hampton Roads, with the news. That revived my spirits considerably all except <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan's</a> being 
wounded ; I could dispense with that. But if it were true, and if peace would follow, and the boys come 
home ! Oh, what bliss! I would die of joy as rapidly as I am pining away with suspense now, I am afraid !

About ten o clock, as we came up, mother went to the window in the entry to tell the news to Mrs. Day, and while speaking, saw a man creeping by under the window, in the narrow little alley on the 
side of the house, evidently listening, for he had previously been standing in the shadow of a tree, 
and left the street to be nearer. When mother ran 
to give the alarm to Charlie, I looked down, and 
there the man was, looking up, as I could dimly see, 
for he crouched down in the shadow of the fence. 
Presently, stooping still, he ran fast towards the 
front of the house, making quite a noise in the long 
tangled grass. When he got near the pepper-bush, 
he drew himself up to his full height, paused a moment as though listening, and then walked quietly 
towards the front gate. By that time Charlie reached 
the front gallery above, and called to him, asking 
what he wanted. Without answering the man walked 
steadily out, closed the gate deliberately; then, suddenly remembering drunkenness would be the best 
excuse, gave a lurch towards the house, walked off perfectly straight in the moonlight, until seeing Dr. Day fastening his gate, he reeled again. 
That man was not drunk! Drunken men cannot 
run crouching, do not shut gates carefully after them, 
would have no inclination to creep in a dim little 
alley merely to creep out again. It may have been 
one of our detectives. Standing in the full moon 
light, which was very bright, he certainly looked 
like a gentleman, for he was dressed in a handsome 
suit of black. He was no citizen. Form your own 
conclusions! Well! after all, he heard no treason. 
Let him play eavesdropper if he finds it consistent 
with his character as a gentleman.

The captain who brought the extra from Mobile 
wished to have it reprinted, but it was instantly 
seized by a Federal officer, who carried it to Butler, 
who monopolized it; so that will never be heard of 
again ; we must wait for other means of information. 
The young boy who told us, reminds me very much 
of Jimmy; he is by no means so handsome, but yet 
there is something that recalls him; and his voice, 
though more childish, sounds like Jimmy's, too. I 
had an opportunity of writing to Lydia by him, of 
which I gladly availed myself, and have just finished 
a really tremendous epistle.
