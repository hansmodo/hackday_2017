Sir, 
</p><p>
On my arrival at this place, I laid your Excellency's letter before Congress, and addressed them 
on the business of the Southern department. I am 
happy to inform you that my appointment is perfectly agreeable to their views and wishes. But I 
am sorry to acquaint you that, from the best account 
I can get of the state and condition of the troops in 
that quarter, nothing is to be expected from them, 
unless large supplies can be forwarded from the 
northward. They are altogether without clothing and 
blankets, and totally unfit for any kind of service. 
To carry them into the field, in this condition, will 
only fill the hospitals, and sacrifice the lives of a 
great many valuable men. Arms are not less wanting than clothing, and wagons as much as either. 
Men, I believe, may be had, if it was in our power 
to equip them for the field. But how we shall do 
this, is difficult for me to imagine. Congress can 
furnish no money, and the Board of War neither clothing nor other necessaries. Indeed, the prospect 
is dismal and truly distressing. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency to urge, unceasingly, the 
necessity of forwarding supplies for the Southern 
army, as it will he impossible to carry on a winter 
campaign without clothing. I have laid before Congress an estimate of our wants; but there is not the 
shadow of a prospect of their being furnished, unless 
constant attention is paid to the business. And I 
am apprehensive, as soon as I am gone, and no one 
left to urge our wants, they will soon be forgotten. 
</p><p>
The late success of the militia against Colonel Ferguson, I am in hopes will be attended with good 
consequences. It will give a severe check to the 
Tories, and spirit and confidence to the Whigs. A 
report prevails this day that Lord Cornwallis has retreated precipitately from Charlotte towards Camden. 
</p><p>
The detachment of the enemy, that sailed lately 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, are landed at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, in Virginia ; and it is said the shipping are pushing up 
the rivers. The troops have taken possession of the 
great bridge, by which, I am told, they command all 
the lower counties. 
</p><p>
How to employ our little force, if we are attacked 
both in Virginia and North Carolina at the same 
time, is difficult to determine. My first object will 
be to equip a flying army, to consist of about eight 
hundred horse, and one thousand infantry. This force, 
with the occasional aid of the militia, will serve to 
confine the enemy in their limits, and render it difficult for them to subsist in the interior country. I 
see but little prospect of getting a force to contend 
with the enemy upon equal grounds, and therefore 
must make the most of a kind of partisan war, until 
we can levy and equip a larger force. Such was the difficulty of getting provisions and providing the 
means of transportation, that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> writes, in 
his last letter, that the army was in the utmost danger of disbanding. 
</p><p>
Congress have invested me with the same powers 
they gave to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, and annexed Maryland 
and Delaware to the Southern department. The arrangement of the army has taken place, and, I hope, 
upon a footing which will render it more respectable 
than it has been, provided the business of finance 
can be got into some regular order. But that is our 
weak side ; and I wish our distresses may be painted 
in their true colors to the Minister of France, as he 
intimated to <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> that your Excellency did 
not appear to be apprehensive of any difficulty from 
the state of our affairs. 
</p><p>
I have made application to the merchants of this 
city for clothing for the Southern army; but they 
excused themselves, as having engaged more already 
than they can perform. I intend to try to put subscriptions on foot in Maryland and Virginia for the 
purpose of supplying clothing. Whether it will produce any good or not, time only can determine. At 
any rate I shall have the satisfaction of having done 
all in my power; and if there is not public spirit 
enough in the people to defend their liberties, they 
will deserve to be slaves. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>General Knox</a> promised to send forward a company 
of artillery, if your Excellency approved thereof I 
wish they may come forward, without loss of time. 
This State have promised to lend me one thousand 
stand of arms, upon a promise of their being replaced, which I beg your Excellency to give an order for, as this was the only footing they could be 
obtained upon. I have the honor to be, &c.,
