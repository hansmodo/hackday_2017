MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DINED yesterday with <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Burr</a>, who lives here in 
style. A number of members of the House, the 
Speaker Mr. Dayton, among the rest. It seems to be 
the general opinion that the House will express some 
opinions unfavorable to the treaty ; but finally carry 
it into effect. There is a good deal of apprehension 
expressed for the Union in conversation. Some think 
and say it cannot last. Such is the repugnance between the east and the west. 
The death of my aunt H., for by that name it is 
most natural for me to call her, is an event that was 
every day to be expected, and as her days of usefulness and satisfaction were past, can be no cause of 
rational grief to her nearest relations. It has not, 
however, failed to revive the remembrance of the 
scenes of my youth, of my father, my uncles, my 
aunts, and my cousins, many of whom were gone 
before her, and to affect me with many tender sentiments and serious reflections. Alas ! she was little 
more than thirty years older than myself. I shall 
never see her years. But why should I regret such 
a prospect as that ? Although I am convinced that 
human life is a happy and agreeable scene, a charming, delightful state, upon the whole, and although my 
share of it has been chequered with perplexities, difficulties, dangers and distresses, which fall to the lot 
of but few, yet it has been sweet and happy on the 
whole, and calls for gratitude to my Maker and Pre 
server. Yet every year, according to my opinions 
and persuasions and expectations, brings me nearer 
to a state of superior excellence and more unmixed 
enjoyment, where I hope to meet all my relations and 
other friends who may have done their duty in this. 
There, my dearest friend, may we meet, and never 
be again separated by any necessities to go to Eu 
rope, or <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, or elsewhere. 
</p><p>
My duty to my mother, and congratulate her on 
the recovery of her arm. I hope to see her again in 
June. But the House of Representatives will keep 
me here as long as possible. 
Your amanuensis improves in her hand-writing. 
She superscribes your letters elegantly. My love to 
her. I am not sorry that John went to England. 
He will have opportunities of improvement and gaining information there.
