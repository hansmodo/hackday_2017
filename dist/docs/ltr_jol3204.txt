DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The enemy's present disposition of his force, and 
all his late operations, indicate a design to attack 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> by a siege in form. To complete the in 
vestiture, he must introduce his ships of war into the harbour. That it is his intention, appears from his 
fixing buoys on the bar, barricading his ships waists, 
and anchoring them in a station where they may 
embrace the first favorable spring tides to enter. 
His transports and store-ships have removed from 
Edisto up Stono River, where they lie contiguous to 
Wappoo Cut, which is the water communication from 
thence to Ashley River. At a point of the main 
land, formed by the issuing of the former into the 
latter, he raised, in the course of a night, the 11th 
instant, a battery of six embrasures. This situation, 
naturally advantageous, he will probably render very 
strong, and establish in it his deposit of military 
stores and provisions. He then may either force a 
passage over Ashley River, or turn it by a circuitous 
march, fortify a camp on the Neck, and open his 
trenches. The best communication between his magazines and camp will be across Ashley River, from a 
bluff, marked Bull, in your large map. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will have learnt that the Commodore and all his officers renounce the idea of defending the passage of the bar ; they declare it impracti 
cable for the frigates to lie in a proper position for 
that purpose. The Government has neglected to pro 
vide floating batteries, which might have been stationed there j so that it has been agreed, as the next 
best plan, to form a line of battle, in such a manner 
as to make a cross-fire with Fort Moultrie ; a shoal, 
called the Middle Grounds, being on the right of the 
ships, and the fort advanced of the left. As it would 
be the enemy's policy, with a leading wind and tide, 
to pass the fire of the fort, and run aboard of our ships, the Commodore is contriving an obstruction, 
which he thinks will check their progress, and allow 
time for the full effect of our fire. 
</p><p>
The impracticability of defending the bar, in the 
first instance, appears to me a great diminution of 
our means of defence. We must not only have a 
greater number of shipping below, and consequently 
withdraw them from flanking the enemy's approaches 
on the Neck, but are subject to the chances of a 
combat, which, in the other case, were out of the 
question. The Commodore has destroyed one set of 
the enemy's buoys 5 and I hope he will cut away 
such as may have been since put down, and order 
the galleys to give all possible annoyance to the 
enemy's ships in the act of entering. 
</p><p>
The attention of the Engineers has been distracted 
by different demonstrations on the part of the enemy, and they have not perfected the line across 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> Neck. Henceforward I hope they will 
confine themselves solely to completing it, and then 
proceed to the construction of some interior inclosed 
works, to prolong the defence. 
</p><p>
As the enemy is determined to proceed by regular approaches, all his operations are submitted to calculation, and he can determine, with mathematical precision, that with such and such means, in a given 
time, he will accomplish his end. Our safety, then, 
must depend upon the seasonable arrival of such reenforcements as will oblige him to raise the siege. 
The Virginia line is much more remote than we 
could have thought it would have been, at this moment. Your Excellency, in person, might rescue us 
all. Virginia and North Carolina would follow you. 
The glory of foiling the enemy in his last great effort, and terminating the war, ought to be reserved 
for you. Whatever fortune attends us, I shall, to my 
latest moments, feel that veneration and attachment, 
which I always had for your Excellency; and I beg 
leave to continue to subscribe myself, 
</p><p>
Your faithful Aid, 
</p><p>

P. S. I entreat your Excellency's pardon for transmitting the annexed letter, in its present imperfect 
state. It was a sketch, which I intended to have 
put in better form, if time had permitted.
