<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='18'>18th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Found it quite exciting to have a spy 
drinking his tea with us perhaps because I knew his profession. I did not like his face. He is said to have a 
scheme by which Washington will fall into our hands like an overripe peach.

Mr. Barnwell urges Mr. Chesnut to remain in the Senate. There are so many generals, or men anxious to be. He 
says Mr. Chesnut can do his country most good by wise counsels where they are most needed. I do not say to the 
contrary ; I dare not throw my influence on the army side, for if anything happened !

Mr. Miles told us last night that he had another letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>General Beauregard</a>. The General wants to know 
if Mr. Miles has delivered his message to Colonel Kershaw. Mr. Miles says he has not done so ; neither does he mean to 
do it. They must settle these matters of veracity according to their own military etiquette. He is a civilian once more. 
It is a foolish wrangle. Colonel Kershaw ought to have reported to his commander-in-chief, and not made an independent report and published it. He meant no harm. He is not yet used to the fine ways of war.

The New York Tribune, is so unfair. It began by howling to get rid of us : we were so wicked. Now that we are 
so willing to leave them to their overrighteous self-consciousness, they cry : Crush our enemy, or they will subjugate us." The idea that we want to invade or subjugate anybody; we would be only too grateful to be left alone. We ask no more of gods or men.

Went to the hospital with a carriage load of peaches and grapes. Made glad the hearts of some men thereby. When 
my supplies gave out, those who had none looked so wistfully as I passed out that I made a second raid on the mar 
ket. Those eyes sunk in cavernous depths and following me from bed to bed haunt me.

Wilmot de Saussure, harrowed my soul by an account of a recent death by drowning on the beach at Sullivan's 
Island. Mr. Porcher, who was trying to save his sister's life, lost his own and his child's. People seem to die out 
of the army quite as much as in it.

Mrs. Randolph presided in all her beautiful majesty at an aid association. The ladies were old, and all wanted 
their own way. They were cross-grained and contradictory, and the blood mounted rebelliously into Mrs. Randolph's 
clear-cut cheeks, but she held her own with dignity and 
grace. One of the causes of disturbance was that Mrs. Randolph proposed to divide everything sent on equally with 
the Yankee wounded and sick prisoners. Some were enthusiastic from a Christian point of View ; some shrieked in 
wrath at the bare idea of putting our noble soldiers on a par with Yankees, living, dying, or dead. Fierce dames were 
some of them, august, severe matrons, who evidently had not been accustomed to hear the other side of any question from 
anybody, and just old enough to find the last pleasure in life to reside in power the power to make their claws felt.
