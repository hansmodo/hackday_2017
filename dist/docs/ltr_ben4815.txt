DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I acquainted you some time since, that I expected soon to 
obtain satisfactory answers to your queries relating to the 
specimens of silk you sent over; but I was disappointed till 
lately, when I had a meeting with Mr. Patterson, esteemed 
one of the best judges of that commodity, who favoured me 
with the enclosed paper, and, in conversation, with the following particulars. 
</p><p>
He thinks that the water, though clear at first, may grow 
foul with the impurities of the cocoons reeled in it, and therefore should be changed as that appears to be the case. He 
gave me a skein of what is called the best Italian silk imported 
here, and advised me to send it over as a pattern, for our 
people to endeavour to imitate, with regard to its evenness, 
cleanness from nibs, and lustre ; and, that they might better 
see the difference and understand his remarks, he wished the 
skeins sent over hither might be returned with it. I send 
them all together accordingly. 
</p><p>
He says the silk reeled from twelve cocoons fetches nearly 
as good a price as that from six, because it winds well, and 
there is less -fine waste; the dropping accidentally, or through 
inattention, three or four of the cocoons out of twelve not 
weakening the thread so much in proportion, as when the 
same number are dropped out of six ; nor is the thread so apt 
to break in winding. I observe that the Italian silk has a 
sweet smell, as if perfumed. He thinks it is the natural smell 
of the silk, when prepared in perfection. He understands 
that the Piedmontese reel is esteemed preferable to Mr. Pullein's. He says we may carry that produce to what 
length we please. It is impossible to overstock the market, as 
the demand is continually increasing, silk being more and 
more worn, and daily entering into the composition of more 
and a greater variety of manufactures. 
</p><p>
I communicated your thanks to Mr. Walpole, who was 
pleased to assure me he should always be ready to afford the 
design all the assistance in his power, and will endeavour to 
procure some eggs for you from Valencia against the next 
season. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for the snuffbox. The wood is 
beautiful. The manufacturer should be encouraged. I 
hope our people will not be disheartened by a few accidents, 
and such disappointments as are incident to all new undertakings, but persevere bravely in the silk business, till they 
have conquered all difficulties. By diligence and patience 
the mouse ate in twain the cable. It is not two centuries since 
it was as much a novelty in France, as it is now with us 
in North America, and the people as much unacquainted 
with it. 
</p><p>
My respects to my good old friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a>. I hope he is recovered of the indisposition you mention. With sincere esteem, I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and 
</p><p>
humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
