LOUISIANA STATE SEMINARY OF LEARNING AND MILITARY ACADEMY,

Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
The quiet which I thought the usual acquiescence of 
the people was merely the prelude to the storm of opinion that now seems irresistible. Politicians, by hearing 
the prejudices of the people and running with the current, 
have succeeded in destroying the government. It cannot 
be stopped now, I fear. I was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> all day 
yesterday, and had a full and unreserved conversation 
with Dr. S. A. Smith, State senator, who is a man of 
education, property, influence, and qualified to judge. 
He was during the canvass a Breckinridge man, but, 
though a Southerner in opinion, is really opposed to a 
dissolution of our government. He has returned from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, where he says he was amazed to see evidences of public sentiment which could not be mistaken. 
The Legislature meets December 10 at Baton Eouge. 
The calling a convention forthwith is to be unanimous, 
the bill for army and State ditto. The Convention will 
meet in January, and only 'two questions will be agitated, 
Immediate dissolution, a declaration of State independence, and a General Convention of Southern States, 
with instructions to demand of the Northern States to 
repeal all laws hostile to slavery and pledges of future 
good behavior. . . . When the Convention meets in 
January, as they will assuredly do, and resolve to secede, 
or to elect members to a General Convention with instructions inconsistent with the nature of things, I must 
quit this place, for it would be neither right for me to 
stay nor would the Governor be justified in placing me 
in this position of trust; for the moment Louisiana 
assumes a position of hostility, then this becomes an 
arsenal and fort. 
</p><p>
Let me hear the moment you think dissolution is inevitable. What Mississippi and Georgia do, this State will 
do likewise. 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
