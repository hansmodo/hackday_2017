DEAR SIR I hope your goodness will pardon me, for the trouble I am going to give you. The gentlemen 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=westmoreland" rel="city">WESTMORELAND</a>, having a great veneration for the character of Lord Camden, particularly for his honourable support of America's liberty against the stamp act, wish 
much to have his lordship's picture to grace their court house. For this purpose, they have paid into my hands 76Z. Ss. for which, I enclose you two bills of exchange, 
and beg the favour of you, to wait on Lord Camdeo, with the enclosed letter; which intreats his lordship's permission, to the taking of his picture. This being 
obtained, I must leave to your judgment, the choice of a limner, only observing that the gentlemen would prefer Reynolds, unless you think his difference in price, 
greater than his superiority in painting. Indeed, I cannot help observing for my part, that I think Mr. West being an American, ought to be preferred in this matter, 
if his skill should approach near to that of the best limner, as I am told it does. 
</p><p>
I must again entreat your forgiveness, for troubling you in this affair. I thought you would not be displeased, 
at this testimony of our esteem for the patriot, whose virtue has saved our common country. 
</p><p>
I am with much esteem, dear sir, your affectionate and obedient servant,
