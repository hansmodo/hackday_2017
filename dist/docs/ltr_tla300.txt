<p><i>Biographer's note:</i></p>
<p>The persistent popularity of <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a> Clemens in the Mississippi River towns of southeastern Iowa may have its origin in the fact that he was the brother of Mark Twain. But surely he is still remembered lovingly for his own sake by those who knew him intimately as neighbors and friends, especially the older people of Keokuk. So gentle, so whimsically charming, and in his later years so delightfully forgetful was he that he scarcely needed the fame of his illustrious brother to make him a memorable figure in Keokuk.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the impression has gone abroad that <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a> Clemens was a rather ridiculous person. This opinion, however, is based upon a mistaken assumption that people laughed at him instead of with him. <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a> was not ridiculous, nor was he even funny. But that he was witty, absent-minded, and often humorously inconsistent is attested by many an anecdote. Somehow his more peculiar characteristics have come to be accepted as wholly indicative of the kind of man he really was.</p>

<p>There is the story about his wedding trip from Keokuk to Muscatine in the winter of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1854">1854</a> when <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a>, having stepped into the stagecoach and carefully arranged his bundles, leaned back in comfort to await the departure of the vehicle only to be apprised by a friend that his newly acquired bride, standing near-by on the platform with her bundles, was also to accompany him on the trip. <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a> himself loved to tell this story and it later found its way into Albert Bigelow Paine's biography of Mark Twain.</p>

<p>But some of the modern versions are scarcely recognizable, having taken on curious accretions which tend toward the ludicrous. For instance, it has been alleged that <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a>, happening one day to be in Keokuk, casually married there. Such casualness in so important an event would be interesting, indeed, if true, but much more interesting is the exquisite little note which disproves it - the note in which <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a> asks for the hand of the young lady he wished for his bride.</p>
