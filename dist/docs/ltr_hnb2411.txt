MY DEAR DEVEREUX: After the many trying vicissitudes of fortune two old friends have undergone during nineteen years that have rolled over them since they 
received that impressing regard for you which no length of time or change of circumstances can ever efface from 
their hearts, your feelings will better suggest to you than I can describe the agreeable surprise with which we have 
just learned you are in <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>. 
</p><p>
Assuredly, the distance of a day's journey which separates us, can not long impede any efforts I can make to 
effect our meeting, if I shall learn by your answer that you do not expect soon to visit <a href="/results.php?city=bath" rel="city">Bath</a>, and that business is likely to detain you in <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, more especially law busi 
ness, in which I could devote to your interest the best efforts of my professional labor or advice. 
</p><p>
Mrs. B., now here with my sister, is in too delicate a state of health to permit her indulging the pleasure she 
would not fail to enjoy of accompanying me to town on such an occasion. Of the deep regret which she will entertain, on conceiving the thought of not seeing you here, you will be the best judge, from the ardor of her mind 
which she lent to the best feelings of her heart in consecrating her sense of your worth and character, in the 
poetical address to you she published, last year, at Montreal, called forth on the occasion of seeing in the papers 
your intended mission from Colombia to Russia, and invindication of your character, which her best sympathies 
have covered with the segis of truth and friendship against the gorgon of calumny that would assail it. The 
volume, containing many other things that will not be uninteresting, I will transmit you by the <a href="/results.php?city=bath" rel="city">Bath</a> coach, if you do not let me take it up with me, or rather to hand it to 
you here. It has been wretchedly printed in Canada. We expect to republish it in <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>.
</p><p>
I forbear to touch upon my present condition or future prospects until we meet, and shall only add, that I shall 
be most impatient to learn whether I shall further hasten to embrace you in town, or shall soon be more gratified 
to welcome you here, where you will accept of a bed. Without the least abatement of our best sentiments, I 
doubt not you will consider us most anxious to hear from you, and believe me, my dear Devereux, 
</p><p>
Unalterably yours, <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT</a>.
