Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote your Excellency at Little River, near 
Ninety Six, I have been favored with your despatch 
of June the 1st. It affords me great pleasure to 
hear that an attack is meditating against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
This measure no doubt will create a powerful diversion in favor of this country ; and I wish most ardently that the Northern States may enable you to complete its reduction. But I confess this is so important an object, that I can hardly flatter myself with 
so fortunate an event. 
</p><p>
The copy of my former letters to Congress will inform your Excellency of the measures I took for the 
defence of Virginia; and inclosed is a copy of my letter to Congress, giving an account of our movements in this quarter, since we raised the siege of 
Ninety Six. I hope the steps I took both with respect to Virginia and here, will meet your approbation. The Marquis has conducted the operations in 
Virginia, as far as I can learn, with great good conduct, and I hope Congress will give him a testimony 
of their good opinion of it. When I found Virginia 
was going to be attacked in so formidable a manner, 
I halted all the troops coming to the southward, and 
determined to struggle with the little force I had in 
the best manner I could, until I could learn better 
the enemy's intentions in that quarter. I thought, 
upon the whole, it was much better to keep up the 
war here, than to give up three States in an attempt 
to afford Virginia such an ineffectual reenforcement, 
as I could have carried to her aid, which must have 
been greatly reduced by a march of at least four 
hundred miles. Besides, if I had left this country, 
the enemy would have been able to detach to Virginia a far greater force than I could have carried 
there ; and the efforts of the militia in this quarter, 
for want of countenance, would have totally ceased. 
All these considerations determined me in the line 
of conduct I pursued ; and I hope time will show the 
measure to be warranted from every principle of good 
policy. 
</p><p>
The late European intelligence, I am apprehensive, 
will determine the enemy upon a new plan of conducting the war. For, instead of attempting to overrun the whole country, I expect they will make an 
effort to complete the reduction of two States, and 
secure the possession of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Intelligence, 
therefore, from the northward will be important. 
Should your Excellency get any information by which 
their intentions may be explained, I beg you will 
forward it with all possible despatch. I am with great 
respect and regard, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
