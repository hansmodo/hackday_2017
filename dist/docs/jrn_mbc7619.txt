means that we are in a tight place. This war was a volunteer business. To-morrow conscription begins the dernier ressort. The President has remodeled his Cabinet, leaving Bragg for North Carolina. His War Minister is Randolph, 
of Virginia. A Union man par excellence, Watts, of Alabama, is Attorney-General. And now, too late by one year,

We are locked in and can not get the requisites for naval architecture/ says a magniloquent person.

Henry Frost says all hands wink at cotton going out. 
Why not send it out and buy ships ? Every now and then 
there is a holocaust of cotton burning," says the magniloquent. Conscription has waked the Rip Van Winkles. The

The Carthaginians begged for peace because they were a luxurious people and could not endure the hardship of war, though the enemy suffered as sharply as they did! " Factions among themselves is the rock on which we split. Now for
