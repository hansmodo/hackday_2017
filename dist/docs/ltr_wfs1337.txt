Report No. 42. 
<p></p>
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,

MEXICO, January 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a>. 
<p></p>
SIR: 
<p></p>
Nothing of interest has occurred since my report 
of the 26th ultimo ; not even the arrival of a mail ; but 
a private conveyance brought up yesterday a letter 
from Brigadier-General Marshall, representing that he 
was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> the 22d ultimo, with a column of troops 
(number not given), one half of whom were on the sick 
report, with measles and diarrhoea, and that he had 
sent back his train to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a> for medicines and 
other supplies. He gave no day for the recommence 
ment of his march. 
<p></p>
The number on the sick report, in this basin, is also 
great. In a total of 14,964, we have only 11,162 " for 
duty." The measles are rife among the new volunteers. 
<p></p>
Colonel Withers, with the 9th Infantry, occupied 
Pachuca, quietly, more than a week ago. Brigadier-General Cadwallader, with the remainder of his brigade, will march for Lerma and Toluca (State capital, 
thirty-eight miles off, in a direction opposite to Pachuca) 
to-day. The general object in occupying the three 
cities is to commence levying the assessments for the 
last month, and, through them, to enforce peace. 
Please see copies of General Orders, Nos. 395-8, here 
with. (Giving the finance details promised in Order, 
No. 3T6.) 
<p></p>
The tobacco monopoly I have thought it necessary 
to abolish. It would be worthless without a prohibition of the plant at the custom houses, and I doubted 
whether our Government, considering the interests of 
some five of our own tobacco-growing States, would 
prohibit the importation. Again, to protect the monopoly, including licenses to cultivators, would require 
a host of excise men. Probably a reasonable duty on 
importation will give larger net receipts for a year or 
two than could be derived in that time from any mo 
nopoly however strictly enforced. 
<p></p>
Like difficulties in management caused me to relinquish to the Mexican States, respectively, the stamped- 
paper and playing-card monopolies. More than a substitute will be found in the quadrupling of the direct 
assessments on the States. 
<p></p>
From the want of sufficient numbers to send, at 
once, columns of five thousand men each to Zacatecas 
and San Luis de Potosi, respectively, I next proposed 
to despatch to the latter place a force of seven thousand, 
which would be sufficient to open the channel of commerce between Tampico and Zacatecas, a distance of 
three hundred and ninety-four miles, and, by the operation, double, perhaps, the receipts at that seaport, as 
well as the interior dues on the precious metals. The 
commercial wealth of Durango would soon fall into the 
same channel. But assuming seven thousand men as 
the minimum force for this neighborhood, including 
the capital, Chapultepec, Pachuca, Lerma, and Toluca, 
I am obliged to wait for further reinforcements to 
make up the one column for San Luis. The delay of 
Brigadier-General Marshall, who had been expected 
daily for nearly a week, is, therefore, quite a vexatious 
disappointment. Possibly before his arrival (should 
the measles here have earlier subsided), I may risk a 
column of five thousand men, leaving, for a time, two 
intermediate posts vacant, and instruct the commander 
(Major-General Butler) to take into his sphere of operation a part of the forces belonging to the base of the 
Rio Grande. A detachment moving upon Tula, and, 
perhaps, leaving Victoria to the left, might cooperate 
very advantageously with the forces at the new centre, 
San Luis, and without endangering the line of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, in which direction, it is supposed, the Mexicans 
cannot have any formidable number of organized 
troops. To concert the double movement, by correspondence, would be the principal difficulty ; but ample 
discretion would be allowed in my general instructions. 
Many of the States of this republic, on account of 
their remoteness from the common centre, sparseness 
of population, and inability to pay more than a trifle 
in the way of contributions, are not worth being occupied. Their influence on the question of peace or war 
is, proportionally, inconsiderable. As reinforcements 
arrive, I shall therefore endeavor to occupy only the 
more populous and wealthy States. 
<p></p>
Most of the mints (all but two, I learn) have been 
farmed by foreigners for terms of years (unexpired), on 
the payment of large sums in advance. The principal 
mint (here) is in hands of the British Consul-General, 
who paid down about $200,000 in February last for 
the term of ten years, and contracted to pay, currently, 
one per centum on the amount of coinage. I suppose 
myself bound to respect such contracts until otherwise 
instructed. Other mints pay, I am informed, one and 
a half per centum on the money turned out. Hence a 
direction in General Orders, No. 395, to examine the 
contracts between the Mexican Government and the 
several mints. Those not under contract will be as 
sessed as heretofore. 
<p></p>
By two conveyances I am expecting mails up from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a> in two and four days. I am anxious to receive the views of the Department on several points 
of importance to me in this command. 
<p></p>
The new Federal Executive and Congress are, as 
yet, not installed. Both, it is believed, will be strongly 
inclined to a peace. 
<p></p>
I have the honor, etc., etc.,
