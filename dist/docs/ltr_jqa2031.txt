DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
. . . The depredations committed upon the commerce of this country have considerably distressed and still more 
alarmed our merchants, and if the principle upon which the 
British have lately proceeded to seize our ships be persisted 
in, I fear we shall have no alternative but war; indeed it is 
of itself a state of war to have everything that passes under 
the denomination of supplies liable to capture. 
</p><p>
The aversion of our people to war is however constantly 
strengthening, and has of late upon several occasions appeared in a very decided manner. The event of our town 
meeting exhibited very forcibly the public sentiment here ; 
a still later occasion has shown the prevalence of the same 
sentiments. 
</p><p>
An attempt was last week made to celebrate the late successes of the French by a second civic festival. It was set 
on foot by the Jacobin-antifederal faction, and they appointed a Committee who applied to the Lieutenant Governor to order out the military and to make a display in be 
half of the Commonwealth. He at first complied with their 
request, ordered out an artillery company, and directed that 
they should be supplied with one hundred cartridges at the 
expense of the State, that is, from the public magazines ; l but 
what with squibs upon the subject in the newspapers, and 
with serious expostulations from some respectable gentle 
men who got intimidated, one despicable passion rescued 
him from the disgrace which another was bringing upon 
him, and he countermanded his orders. The civic "festival 
is postponed and we shall hear no more of it until some new 
accident shall give another clue to those who set it on foot. 
</p><p>
The old gentleman has hurt himself by this improper compliance with an insolent request. The general opinion 
seems to be that there will be no choice of a governor by 
the people at our ensuing election. It is my opinion how 
ever that Mr. Adams will be chosen. He may do less harm 
than some others, but he will certainly never do any good. 
Stat magni nominis umbra. His present impotence leans 
for support on his former services, and the office will be 
given him as a reward, not as an employment. I am, etc.
