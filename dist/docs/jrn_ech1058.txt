I see, by late intelligence from home, that the Atlantic papers, with few exceptions, have taken grounds against the Vigilance Committees in California and denounce them as "mobs" and
"lynchers." We cannot blame them much for this course; but they do not understand the causes which have driven the people to take upon themselves the speedy and prompt trial and punishment of criminals. In the old States, where society is properly organized, and law and order prevail, such a course might properly be denounced as "mob-law" and "lynch-law."

But criminals and adventurers from every part of the globe have flocked to California in great numbers for the past three years. If a criminal was brought up before Court, charged with some heinous offence, a confederate was always ready to step up and prove an alibi, and of course the prisoner must be released. The murderer, the assassin and the incendiary lurked around in open day. The people were compelled for their own protection to take upon them the responsibilities they did. And what has been the result? Law and order and justice again prevail, security is given to life and property, and a number of vile marauders have met the fate they so richly merited. Not a single one of all the wretches executed by the Vigilance Committees, but confessed enough of crime to deserve the halter.

In this city, these wretches were all tried before a jury of Sonora citizens and that jury's verdict fixed their punishment. The vexations, delays and technicalities of the law through which so many criminals escape punishment were laid aside, and justice quickly and promptly vindicated. Recently, only two persons have been arrested by the Vigilance Committee. One a Sydney convict, who was tried for stealing a horse, was convicted and sentenced to receive fifty lashes on the bare back, have his head shaved, and never be found in the country again after twenty-four hours under
penalty of death. The same punishment was dealt the other, a Mexican who stole one of Colt's six-shooters from a miner who gave the rascal his breakfast and dinner.
