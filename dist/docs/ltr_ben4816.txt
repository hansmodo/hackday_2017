LOVING COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of May iyth, and rejoice to hear, 
that you and your good family are well. My love to them. 
With this I send you the print you desire for Mr. Bowen. He 
does me honour in accepting it.

Sally Franklin presents her duty to you and Mrs. Franklin. 
Yesterday a very odd accident happened, which I must mention to you, as it relates to your grandfather. A person, that 
deals in old books, of whom I sometimes buy, acquainted me, 
that he had a curious collection of pamphlets bound in eight 
volumes folio, and twenty-four volumes quarto and octavo, 
which he thought, from the subjects, I might like to have, 
and that he would sell them cheap. I desired to see them, 
and he brought them to me. On examining, I found that 
they contained all the principal pamphlets and papers on 
public affairs, that had been printed here from the Restoration down to <a href='/results.php?year=1715'>1715</a>. In one of the blank leaves at the beginning of each volume the collector had written the titles of the 
pieces contained in it, and the price they cost him. Also 
notes in the margin of many of the pieces ; and the collector, 
I find, from the handwriting and various other circumstances, was your grandfather, my uncle Benjamin. Wherefore, I 
the more readily agreed to buy them. I suppose he parted 
with them, when he left England and came to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, soon 
after your father, which was about the year <a href='/results.php?year=1716'>1716</a> or <a href='/results.php?year=1717'>1717</a>, 
now more than fifty years since. In whose hands they have 
been all this time I know not. The oddity is, that the bookseller, who could suspect nothing of any relation between me 
and the collector, should happen to make me the offer of them. 
My love to your good wife and children. Your affectionate 
cousin, B. FRANKLIN.
