Dear Brother : . . . Your letter endorsing Hayes is 
first-rate, and meets general approval. I agree with you 
that no one should be the President unless he was with 
us heart and soul in the Civil War; and Hayes fills the 
bill perfectly. 
</p><p>
I should be delighted to have him nominated and 
elected. 
</p><p>
The Democrats, in turning between the Democrats 
of the North and South, will probably commit a mistake 
that will reunite the Republicans.

I see the "Herald," in an elaborate and good article on 
saving money in the War Department estimates, criticizes the sending of officers abroad at public expense, 
instancing my case. Not one cent of my expenses was 
paid by the Government. I availed myself of the frigate Wabash to reach Gibraltar, whither she was bound in 
her course to the Mediterranean. I paid my mess-bill, 
which amounted to $130 (more than the price of passage over in a Cunarder). 
</p><p>
If you happen to see one of those reporters, you 
could say as much. I will not, because on searching 
they will find that not a cent was paid for my expenses 
abroad. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
