HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,

Dear Brother : Nobody now sees the President except 
the doctors, and we are compelled to base our opinions 
on the bulletins which are sent by telegraph all around 
the country. 
</p><p>
These warrant us to believe that Garfield will recover, 
but after a long, painful process, leaving him crippled 
or emaciated. It is too bad that the law is so unequal 
to the punishment of the man who intended to murder 
him. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>.
