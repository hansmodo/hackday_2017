SIR: 
</p><p>
I desire that you will immediately cause the contents of this letter 
and the enclosed Proclamation to be circulated, and generally made 
known throughout the district of your regiment, in order that delinquents and offenders may be made known of the consequences which will 
ensue from a neglect or refusal of their duty to the State. You are to 
order one-half of your regiment immediately to this town, and transmit 
to me as soon as possible a list of those who are, or may be drafted 
or ordered to march, to the end that it may be known who are defaulters to be effected by the Proclamation, which they may be assured will 
be carried into execution. People may be satisfied that the small pox is 
not in town, but if it was, I should not admit the circumstance as an 
excuse for the militia not coming down when ordered ; if they will not 
come, they must abide the present as well as future consequences. I 
repeat in the most positive and peremptory terms, that I must have one-half of your regiment here, with the utmost expedition; that part of the 
regiment which remains in the district are to do patrol duty, for keeping 
the negroes in order, and be employed in suppressing any insurrections 
of the disaffected and in apprehending and securing persons who go 
about (as I am informed many do) making it their business to propagate 
false news, spread groundless reports, and sow discontent among the 
people; such persons are to be safely conveyed to me, with the witnesses 
against them. I shall expect the utmost exertions of yourself, and the 
officers under you, to carry every part of these orders strictly and speedily into execution. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
