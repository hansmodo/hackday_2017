DEAR GENERAL, 
In the following I shall give your Excellency a 
state of facts relative to the late capture of Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson and part of his detachment, on 
the lines of this post, on the 3d instant. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson was at that time at 
Young's, near the White Plains ; his detachment consisted of five companies. Captain Watson, of the 
third regiment, with his company, was at Young's 
house with the Lieutenant-Colonel. Captain Roberts, 
of the fifteenth regiment, and Captain Stoddard, of the 
first regiment, were on his right ; their greatest distance about two miles. On his left were Captain Lieutenant Farley, of the ninth regiment, and Captain 
Cooper, of the fourteenth regiment ; their extreme 
distance rather greater than the companies on the 
right. Pickets were advanced from each. 
</p><p>
On the morning of the 3d instant, about nine-o'clock, the Lieutenant-Colonel was informed that a 
body of the enemy's horse were advancing, and, at 
that time, about two and a half miles distant. Apprehending the enemy to be horse only, he determined to remain where he was, and sent to the several 
companies to join him. Soon after this, the enemy 
attacked his picket (a sergeant and eight men), who 
fired on the horse, which checked them. On which 
the picket attempted to join the body, but were over 
taken by the horse, one or two of them wounded, 
and the whole taken prisoners. Not long after, the 
enemy's horse appeared in sight of the house. The 
Lieutenant-Colonel had been joined by Captain Roberts's company, who formed on the right. The enemy's horse halted at a distance, and discharged their 
rifles. Soon after, the infantry appeared, advancing to 
the front and right flank of our troops, who were now 
joined by Captain-Lieutenant Farley's company on 
the left; Captain Stoddard and Captain Cooper coming up, one on the right, the other on the left. Our troops preserved their order, and did not fire until 
some time after the enemy began. When they received orders to fire, the enemy immediately scattered, 
availing themselves of trees and the ground, of which, 
it must be acknowledged, they very judiciously took 
the advantage, springing from one tree and place to 
another, and constantly gaining ground ; their fire being directed both against the front and flank of our troops, and a number being killed and wounded, 
they broke, some retreating up the road, others into 
the house, from the doors and windows of which 
they fired on the enemy. 
</p><p>
At this time, Captain Stoddard and Captain Cooper 
came up ; the former gave the enemy two or three fires, but, the distance being great, probably did little 
or no execution. The horse, at this instant, were 
very active, and overtook several of our men who 
were making their escape. It is said our troops discovered great bravery, and fought well for about fif 
teen minutes, when the Lieutenant-Colonel was compelled to surrender. We had fourteen men killed on 
the spot, including Captain Roberts ; and seventeen 
wounded, three of whom are since dead. Lieutenant Colonel Thompson, of Marshall's, Captain Watson, of 
Greaton's, Captain Farley, of Wesson's, Lieutenant Burley, of Tupper's, Lieutenant Maynard, of Greaton's, 
Ensign Fowler, of Nixon's, and Ensign Bradley, of 
Sheppard's, with ninety non-commissioned officers and 
soldiers, were taken prisoners ; nine of whom, who 
were wounded, were left by the enemy at a house 
some miles down the road. 
</p><p>
The enemy set fire to Young's house, and soon re 
tired, leaving two dead, and carrying off their wounded; among whom was a Captain of grenadiers, wound
in the hip, and a Lieutenant of the infantry, in 
the thigh. Our troops immediately after went on to 
the ground, and buried the dead. The enemy's force 
is said to have consisted of about sixty horse, 
</p><p>
and forty of the refugees, and between four hundred 
and five hundred infantry, detached from different 
corps, including a part or the whole of the grenadier 
and light infantry companies of the guards. Colonel Enimerick was out as a volunteer, on foot, with his 
rifle, and was very active. Colonel Morton, of the 
guards, commanded the whole, and Colonel Delany 
was with the refugee horse. 
</p><p>
By two deserters, who left Fort Washington a few days since, I am informed that the enemy had 
at that place about one hundred and fifty sleighs, 
when they came away. The sleighs were employed 
in hauling wood. I am just now informed, by Colonel Badlam, who is on the advanced post, that a body of 
three hundred of the enemy's horse (probably part of 
these militia), and the seventh British regiment, came 
the last Monday from -Long Island to Westchester on 
the ice, where they now are. Whether their taking post at Westchester is with offensive or defensive 
views, is uncertain; probably both. I have written 
Brigadier-General Poor to hold his brigade in the 
most perfect readiness for action, have patrols on the 
ice of Hudson's River, against <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, and from the 
guard at , down towards Fort Montgomery. 
</p><p>
Every precaution is in exercise; and I trust the enemy will be disappointed, should they attempt to surprise us. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
