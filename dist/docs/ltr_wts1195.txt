Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
The Indian War on the plains need simply amount to 
this. We have now selected and provided reservations 
for all, off the great roads. All who cling to their old 
hunting grounds are hostile and will remain so till killed 
off. We will have a sort of predatory war for years, 
every now and then be shocked by the indiscriminate murder of travellers and settlers, but the country is so large, 
and the advantage of the Indians so great, that we cannot 
make a single war and end it. From the nature of 
things we must take chances and clean out Indians as 
we encounter them. 
</p><p>
Our troops are now scattered and have daily chases and 
skirmishes, sometimes getting the best and sometimes the 
worst, but the Indians have this great advantage, they 
can steal fresh horses when they need them and drop the 
jaded ones. We must operate each man to his own horse, 
and cannot renew except by purchase in a distant and 
cheap market. 
</p><p>
I will keep things thus, and when winter starves their 
ponies they will want a truce and shan't have it, unless 
the civil influence compels me again as it did last 
winter. 
</p><p>
If Grant is elected, that old Indian system will be 
broken up, and then with the annuities which are ample 
expended in connection with and in subordination to military movements, will soon bring the whole matter within 
easy control. Then there are $134,000 appropriated for 
the Cheyennes and Arapahoes, all of whom are at war, 
and yet the Indian Bureau contend they are forced by 
law to invest it in shoes, stockings, blankets, and dry 
goods for these very Indians. They don't want any of 
these things, but if it could be put in corn, salt, and cattle, 
we could detach half the hostiles and get them down on 
the Canadian, two hundred miles south of the Kansas 
road. 
</p><p>
Grant is still at Galena, and I doubt if he will get to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> till the November election is over. I have 
written to him to come down here to the Fair which 
begins October 5, but the Democrats are so strong and 
demonstrative here that I think he is a little turned 
against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
