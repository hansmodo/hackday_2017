I requested my private secretary to ask Col. Benton to call today. He called about three o'clock P.M. I had a conversation with him in relation to the propriety of creating a Lieutenant-General of the army, and expressed to him my apprehensions, from what I had learned from members of Congress, that such a proposition if made could not pass Congress. Without expressing an opinion upon this point, he urged that I should make the proposition at all events, and if Congress rejected it the responsibility would be theirs, and the country would see that they had refused to grant me the means Which I had asked in order to prosecute the war. I found Col. Benton fixed upon this point. If I do not propose it, it is manifest from my interview with him that both he and his friends will be greatly dissatisfied.
