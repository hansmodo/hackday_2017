My dear Dr, 
</p><p>
Your highly esteemed letter of the iy th & 18th  ins 1 came to hand 
last night, & truly thank you for the information & good wishes therein 
contained, the latter I know being sincere & disinterested & of course 
was duly appreciated I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a> on my return on the morn 
ing of the 13th  & reached here, on the other side, on the same evening 
but was during the night quite unwell, with considerable fever, which 
compelled me to keep my tent the 14th  . On the 15th  my fever having 
left me, I at once commenced making preparation for crossing, both 
armies having remained quiet up to that time. On the morning of the 
1 7th  , returning from examining the several places for crossing the river 
recommended by the Engineers, I rec d by a flag a communication from 
Gen Arista by a Gen officer, proposals for an armistice ; & if that was 
not acceded to, that said officer was authorized to enter into any arrange 
ments we might agree on to put a stop to hostilities ; I at once informed 
him that the war must be carried on, that they had commenced it, & I 
could not put a stop to it, without orders from my gov , but that, if he 
would deliver up all all the public property here he might withdraw with 
out interruption their troops from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> including his sick and 
wounded, he then made some proposition for me not to occupy Matamoros or to cross the Rio Grande, that many of their wounded could 
not be removed ; I stated that we never made war on the sick, wounded, 
or woman or children, but that I would cross the river the next day, & 
if the town made any resistance would destroy it, which I was then pre 
pared to do, as our morters had that moment arrived ; he then said he 
would report my wishes to Gen Arrista, & let me know his determination before sun down ; at the same time my preparations were actively 
going on for crossing ; not having heard from Arista, we commenced 
crossing at day light, but soon learned that Arista with his whole force 
consisting of some four thousand men, had abandoned the town during 
the night leaving the sick & wounded to our mercy, having previously 
sent off his baggage & most of his artillery beyond our reach, throwing 
the balance in the river, with a large quantity of ammunition ; soon after 
which a deputation from the civil authorities waited on me to offer terms, 
or to know intentions I informed them that I would not hear any 
terms on their part, that I would take possession of their city which I 
did the same day, but would respect persons & private property, & 
permit their civil laws to go on as usual, at any rate for the present ; so 
that we are all now encamped on the enemies soil without firing a gun 
We lost however a fine young officer L l Stephens of the Dragoons who 
was unfortunately drowned in crossing the river

I much fear so many volunteers will come we will hardly find any 
thing for them to do ; the enemies principal posissions are so far off, with 
deserts intervening that it will be I fear impossible to reach them for want 
of transportation. I truly regret to see they are organizing a compy of 
Taylor guards &c in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> as I have a great horor of being made a 
lion of I was pleased to hear of the arrival of Gen Smith as he will 
afford me efficient aid, should we have anything to do Whether we 
shall be ordered to carry the war into the heart of the country, or confine 
our operation to the banks of the Rio Grande, time must determine- 
As to myself I heartily wish the war was at an end Capt Taylors case 
will be favorably considered if he has left in the Alabama, or should do 
so in any other vessel. I think you done right in drawing your pay & 
investing it in Ohio stock which is I make no doubt a safe investment 
I rec d Cassess speech on the Oregon question & am glad you opened 
it ; it is no doubt a very able production or view of the question, but I 
shall hardly read it I also rec d Senator Ashley- speech on the same 
subject but shall hardly read it likewise ; I have no opinion of the 
honesty or patriotism of either My health if not entirely restored is 
in a fair way to become so, being much better to-day than it has been for 
several days past ; I only need a few days rest & quiet for it to be per 
fectly re-established My regards to Major Munroe & the gentlemen 
of your profession, as well as other inquiring friends I regretted to 
hear your own, as well as the health of Dr Russell 1 was not good, but 
truly hope this will find you both on the mend, if not entirely restored.

Yours Truly & Sincerely
