MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is now a long time since I had an opportunity of 
writing to you, and I fear you have suffered unnecessary anxiety on my account. In the morning of the 
19th instant, the Congress were alarmed in their beds 
by a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hamilton</a>, one of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>'s family, that the enemy was in possession of 
the ford over the Schuylkill and the boats, so that they 
had it in their power to be in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> before 
morning. The papers of Congress belonging to the Secretary's office, the War office, the Treasury office, &c., 
were before sent to Bristol. The President, and all the 
other gentlemen were gone that road, so I followed 
with my friend Mr. Marchant, of Rhode Island, to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, in the Jerseys. We stayed at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> until the 
21st, when we set off to Easton, upon the forks of 
Delaware. From Easton we went to <a href='/results.php?city=bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>, from 
thence to Reading, from thence to Lancaster, and 
from thence to this town, which is about a dozen 
miles over the Susquehannah river. Here Congress 
is to sit. In order to convey the papers with safety, 
which are of more importance than all the members, 
we were induced to take this circuit, which is near a 
hundred and eighty miles, whereas this town, by the 
direct road, is not more than eighty-eight miles from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. This tour has given me an opportunity 
of seeing many parts of this country which I never 
saw before. 
</p><p>
This morning <a href='/results.php?tla=rot' rel='met'>Major Troup</a> arrived here with a 
large packet from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel=''>General Gates</a>, containing very 
agreeable intelligence, which I need not repeat, as 
you have much earlier intelligence from that part 
than we have. I wish affairs here wore as pleasing 
an aspect. But alas, they do not. 
</p><p>
I shall avoid every thing like history, and make no 
reflections. However, <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> is in a 
condition tolerably respectable, and the militia are 
now turning out from Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania in small numbers. All the apology that can 
be made for this part of the world is, that Mr. Howe's 
march from Elk to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, was through the 
very regions of passive obedience. The whole country 
through which he passed is inhabited by Quakers. 
</p><p>
There is not such another body of Quakers in all 
America, perhaps not in all the world. 
</p><p>
I am still of opinion that <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will be no 
loss to us. I am very comfortably situated here in the 
house of General Roberdeau, whose hospitality has 
taken in Mr. S. Adams, Mr. Gerry and me. My 
health is as good as common, and I assure you my 
spirits not the worse for the loss of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Bid- 
die in the continental frigate, at South Carolina, has 
made a noble cruise and taken four very valuable 
prizes.
