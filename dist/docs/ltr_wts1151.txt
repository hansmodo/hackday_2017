My Dear Brother : To-morrow I start with my corps 
to bring up the rear of the movement against Grand 
Gulf, and, maybe, Jackson, Miss. I feel in its success 
less confidence than in/any similar undertaking of the 
war, but it is my duty /to co-operate with zeal, and I shall 
endeavor to do it. . .

Grant came down by river, and his entire army, about 
seventy thousand, is now near here, but the whole country is under water, save little ribands of alluvial ground 
along the main Mississippi and all parallel bayous. 
One month ago my proposition was to fall back upon 
our original plan, modified by the fact that Yazoo River 
could be entered by its head and could be used as far 
down as Greenwood, which is the mouth of Yolobusha. If our gunboats could have passed that point, 
a real substantial advantage would have been gained, 
for it would have enabled the army to pass the Yolobusha, whereas now it is a serious obstacle like the 
Eappahannock, and will have to be fought for. . . .

McClernand's corps marched from Milliken's Bend 
along a narrow road to Carthage. McPherson has followed, and I start to-morrow. Sixty thousand men will 
thus be on a single road, narrow, crooked, and liable to 
become a quagmire on the occurrence of a single rain. 
We hope to carry ten days' rations with us. Seven 
iron-clad gunboats and seven transports have run the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> batteries; with these we can reach Grand 
Gulf below the mouth of Black River, whence there is 
a road to Raymond sixty -five miles, and Jackson. The 
destruction of this road isolates <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>. Now if we 
can sustain the army it may do, but I know the materials or food, forage or ammunition, cannot be conveyed 
on that single precarious road. Grant has been opening a canal from the Mississippi to Willow Bayou, 
three miles, and Willow Bayou roundaway and Bayou 
Vidal form a connected channel for forty-seven miles, 
terminating at Carthage, but it is crooked, narrow, 
and full of trees. Large working parties are employed in removing trees, but at best it is only calculated that it can be used by scows drawn by small steam 
tugs. It is not even contemplated that the smallest 
transports can navigate it. The canal itself is far from 
being done. I went through it yesterday in a small 
boat, and estimate it will take one month to give it 
eight feet of water with the present stage, but the water 
in the river is now falling rapidly. We count on another rise in June from the Missouri, but these rises are 
accidental and may or not come. The great difficulty 
will be to support an army operating from Grand 
Gulf. . . .

Between the two choices open to him I far prefer 
Grenada. One is sure and natural, the other is difficult 
and hazardous in the extreme. There is no national or 
political reason why this army should be forced to 
undertake unnecessary hazard. It is far in advance of 
Hooker, Rosecrans, or Curtis. We have done far more 
than either of these armies, but have encountered more 
calumny and abuse than all. . . .

Banks is afraid even to attempt Port Hudson, and 
from all I can hear is more likely to be caged up in New 
Orleans than to assist us against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>. . . . 
Affectionately your brother,
