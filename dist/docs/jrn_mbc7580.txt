<a rel='month origin' value='7'>July</a> <a rel='day origin' value='24'>24th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Here Mr. Chesnut opened my door and walked in. Out of the fulness of the heart the mouth 
speaketh. I had to ask no questions. He gave me an account of the battle as he saw it (walking up and down my 
room, occasionally seating himself on a window sill, but too restless to remain still many moments) ; and told what 
regiments he was sent to bring up. He took the orders to <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Colonel Jackson</a>, whose regiment stood so stock still under 
fire that they were called a " stone wall." Also, they call 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a>, Eugene, and <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston</a>, Marlboro. Mr. Chesnut rode with Lay's cavalry after the retreating enemy in 
the pursuit, they following them until midnight. Then there came such a fall of rain rain such as is only known 
in semitropical lands.

In the drawing-room, Colonel Chesnut was the lt belle of the ball ; they crowded him so for news. He was the 
first arrival that they could get at from the field of battle. But the women had to give way to the dignitaries 
of the land, who were as filled with curiosity as them selves Mr. Barnwell, <a href='/results.php?tla=rmh' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Hunter</a>, Mr. Cobb, Captain Ingraham, etc.

Wilmot de Saussure says Wilson of Massachusetts, a Senator of the United States, came to Manassas, en route 
to Richmond, with his dancing shoes ready for a festive scene which was to celebrate a triumph. The New York 
Tribune said: " In a few days we shall have Richmond, Memphis, and New Orleans. They must be taken and at 
once. For a few days maybe now they will modestly substitute l in a few years.

They brought me a Yankee soldier's portfolio from the battle-field. The letters had been franked by Senator Harlan. One might shed tears over some of the letters. Women, wives and mothers, are the same everywhere. 
What a comfort the spelling was ! We had been willing to admit that their universal free-School education had put 
them, rank and file, ahead of us literarily, but these letters do not attest that fact. The spelling is comically bad.
