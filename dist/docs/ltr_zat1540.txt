Dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your communication of the 10th  ins f on the subject of Dr Hawkin s 
course in regard to the sick & wounded sent to & left at S c Josephs 
Island was rec d & has been duly considered ; I need not say the course 
pursued by Dr H. highly objectionable and improper, and orders will be 
given to prevent its occurrence I trust for the time to come 
</p><p>
Your esteemed letter of the 8th  was duly rec d and I was very much 
gratified to hear those brave fellows in whom I take the most lively & I 
may say deepest interest were generally on the mend 
</p><p>
I observe you complain of the annoyance of the Volunteers, they 
are trifling to what I have to undergo & submit to, but which I will try 
& get through in the best way I can & with at least all the good feelings 
& temper I can command even should they drive me out of my tent ; 
but I hope all those who arrived some time since have got over to the 
Boreta & will be sent there from the Brasos depot as fast as they arrive 
there, without coming to Fort Polk You know my opinion of sutlers 
& therefore hardly need expatiate on their merits or demerits ; their 
object is to make money regardless of consequences I truly and sin 
cerely thank you for your congratulation on the flattering manner the 
country has approbated my late conduct as connected with the recent suc 
cess of our arms, far beyond what I expected, and no doubt in the 
opinion of many very far beyond what it deserved ; at any rate I can 
truly say I feel not only truly gratified but greatly honored by the same ; 
I would feel doubly so could I have any surety it would have the effect in 
the remotest degree to prompt my descendants to tread the path of honor 
by pursuing a bold, manly, and honest course in all the relations and 
situatis of life, which I sincerely hope will be the case ; Dick 1 was to have 
come out in the Galveston & I wrote home that he had reached Point 
Isabel, having been so informed ; but afterwards learned he had or would 
come out in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a>, by which vessel I rec d a letter from Judge 
Butler that when those vessels left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> where he the Judge then 
was, that he was quite unwell, so much so, that he had advised him to 
consult Dr McGormick whether situated as he was, he had not better 
return to Baton Rouge ; since when I have understood he would come 
out in the Allabama, & Dr M c would come out with him, as a looker on ; 
so I do not now know whether to expect him or not ; but hope if his health 
is at all precarious or doubtful, he will not attempt to come, as it is no 
place for any one in poor health, much less one who is quite sick 
</p><p>
I rec d a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> saying he had been assigned to the 
command of the troops to invade Mexico, but that he did not expect to 
join immediately, in the meantime I would go on with my operations as 
I thought most to the interest of the public service ; that no Gen plan of 
opperations had been determined, &c It is strange passing strange 
that I have heard nothing from Washing since my official report of the 
battles of the 8th  & 9th reached there, which I have seen published in 
in the National Intelligencer & Union, the receipt of them have not 
been acknowledged Something is going on at Gen h d quarters in 
regard to this matter that we are not aware of A report has reached 
here that after my reports reached Washington, the Southern & Western 
members waited on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> & protested against my being superseded in my present command by any one which he assured them should 
not be done ; if so I very much regret it, as I consider this command 
properly his, & I have no wish to prevent his exercising it, but much 
rather he would do so than otherwis 
</p><p>
A committee reached here app d by the Louisiana legislature to tender to me & the officers & soldiers of the army under my command the 
thanks of that body for the manner we had discharged our duty & sustained the honor & character of the American armies in the two recent 
engagements with the enemy ; they are a high set of gentlemen some of 
them have been on a frolic pretty much ever since they have been here ; 
I understand they will leave tomorrow, or perhaps a portion of them 
to-day 
</p><p>
I found one letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> in the postoffice for you, with several 
n. papers 1 which I sent down by Capt. May yesterday evening to his 
camp, & who has promised to forward them to Fort Polk in the 
morning 
</p><p>
We have nothing new or of interest here, things going on about as 
usual ; the steamboat Cincinnati is in sight I suppose loaded with provisions, but we shall not be able to move from here until two or three of 
the steamboats sent for to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> arrive, when that will be god only 
knows My respects Munroe & the gentlemen of the medical Staff 
</p><p>
With great respect and esteem
