Dear Brother : Your letter of the 27th came as I was 
starting for the Ohio Fair. From thence I went to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lancaster" rel="city">Lancaster</a>, and found all well. . . . My trip to the 
Pacific over the Canadian Railroad was a great success. 
We travelled 7000 miles without fatigue, accident, 
or detention. We stopped over at the chief points of 
interest, such as Toronto, Montreal, Sudbury, Port 
Arthur, Winnipeg, Calgary, Banff, Donald, Glacier 
House, Vancouver, Victoria, Seattle, and Tacoma, and 
yet made the round trip within the four weeks allowed. 
We did not go to Alaska, because of the fogs and for 
want of time. The trip was very instructive, giving 
me an inside view of many questions that may be important in the future. The country did not impress me as 
a desirable acquisition, though it would not be a bad one. 
The people are hardy and industrious. If they had free 
commercial intercourse with the United States, their 
farms, forests, and mines would become more valuable, 
but at the expense of the manufactures. If the population of Mexico and Canada were homogeneous with ours, 
the union of the three countries would make the whole 
the most powerful nation in the world. I am not so 
sure but this would be a good thing to do. ... 
Affectionately yours,
