submitted to the Cabinet the propriety of raising the blockade of such of the ports of Mexico as may be in the military possession of our arms, and of levying a tax or tariff of duties on commerce to such ports, to be applied to defray the expenses of the war.  The Attorney-General, whom I had requested on yesterday to examine the authorities on the executive power, brought with him the books containing the doctrine on the subject, and gave his opinion that I possessed the undoubted power, and advised that it should be exercised. All the Cabinet concurred with the Attorney-General, and I myself was clear that the power existed, and that it would be wise to exercise it. Some discussion upon the details of the measure took place.
