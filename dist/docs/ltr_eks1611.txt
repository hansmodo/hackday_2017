. . . This is a larger town than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, contain 
ing fourteen thousand inhabitants, but is not so well 
built, except in the central part. The building material is clay formed into square blocks and hard 
ened in the sun. The Cathedral is a gorgeous affair, 
the altarpiece is more than thirty feet in height by 
twenty-five in breadth, and is composed of pillars, 
wreaths, mouldings, etc., heavily gilded. It contains 
nine niches in each of which is a statue as large as 
life, the central and upper one being the Virgin. 
There are some thirty statues in this church and some 
fine paintings. The image of our Saviour is repeated 
in every part of it. In one place he is represented as 
just dead, most magnificently laid out in a glass case; 
his countenance is truly lovely, with a fine black 
moustache, his head bound with a silk fillet. Im 
mediately above him is a statue of the Mother with 
the Child in her arms. She is represented as a most 
lovely woman elegantly arrayed in richly ornamented 
white satin robes, which are sustained by an angel. 
Her whole person is covered with spangles, chains, 
and jewels. Opposite this is a thrilling Crucifixion, 
the wound in the side bleeding, the arms and legs 
gashed, and the pallid countenance expressing the 
last agonies of death. The religion of the inhabitants 
is a mixture of the Roman Catholic and the super 
stitions of paganism. They are awfully addicted to 
ringing bells. Every church and chapel tower holds 
several of great size. They are strongly alloyed with 
silver and their tones are louder and finer than any I 
have ever heard in the United States. " From morn 
to dewy eve " tis clang, clang, bang, bang, ding dong. 
At stated periods of the day, at certain signals from 
some old monster bell all the people, no matter how 
engaged, at work or at play, in the street or in the 
house, uncover rapidly, cross themselves and mutter 
a prayer. This universal reverence to the Deity of all 
the people at the same time strikes the stranger as a 
beautiful and almost sublime custom, and is strongly 
contrasted with our manner, for whatever may be 
our sentiments we make no outward show of religious 
feeling. It is painful to know that these people 
actually do not comprehend the reason of their acts. 
I asked a man why he took off his hat and crossed 
himself. He replied: " Because it is twelve o clock." 
Another probably would say: " Because the priest 
told me to do so." This town is built so high up among 
the mountains that the climate is quite cold notwith 
standing its southern latitude. The apple and pear 
grow to perfection and wheat is the staple. The great 
want is wood. Its scarcity renders the country almost 
uninhabitable. We can t obtain enough to cook with 
properly, and what we do get is in sticks not larger 
than my arm, brought many miles on jackasses. One 
of the principal productions of the country is the aloe, 
agave, maguey or century plant, it being known by 
each of these names. From it the " pulque " a fermented and exceedingly intoxicating drink is made. 
The plant is cultivated with great care and grows to 
an enormous size, the tall flower shafts shooting up 
often thirty feet. The centre shaft is drawn out, leaving a bowl which fills three times a day with juice 
which when fermented resembles buttermilk, bearing 
on its surface a froth like that on a pail of milk just 
drawn from the cow. It has an acid unpleasant taste 
much relished by the natives. The plant after a few 
days is suffered to rest when it throws out another 
central shoot. It is tapped three times a year. 
Our regiment is quartered in an old Franciscan 
monastery with a large chapel attached to it. It is 
filled with evidences of the gross superstition of the 
people. A fat, old, licentious-looking friar wanders 
about, sole representative of his departed brethren. 
My quarters are in an apothecary s shop with its 
shelves, labeled boxes and counter all remaining. The 
counter serves for a bunk for N - and myself, 
while M - occupies the counting-room. In spite 
of all the scrubbing I have bestowed upon it, the 
place smells vilely of pills, rancid lard, etc., and be 
sides is a good stand for fleas, which are about the 
size of small crickets.

We are quite as much in the dark here with regard 
to the probable movements of the army as you can be. 
We are stationed on the salient point of our conquest, 
less than two thousand strong, entirely inactive, and 
so far as we know there are no troops of the enemy 
within two hundred miles of us. Santa Anna is recruiting, drilling, and equipping an army at San Luis 
Potosi already thirty thousand strong. He is casting 
all the church bells into cannon I wish he had those 
that are deafening me at this moment and says he 
will redeem the honor of the Mexican arms if we will 
pay him a visit at San Luis. He well knows it is almost impossible for an army drawing its supplies 
from the rear to march upon that place. . . . The 
intelligent portion of the Mexican population are of 
the opinion, and express it to us without reserve, that 
the war is wicked and aggressive on the part of the 
United States. They claim that Texas never extended 
farther than the Nueces, and say that it would have 
been yielded to that river without opposition. The 
inhabitants generally have not suffered by the war, 
but on the contrary have profited by it, while the 
army, it is said, are strong advocates for negotiation. 
If this war is to be protracted by the obstinacy of this 
people, I hope and expect to see the City of Mexico 
in another twelve months. . . .
