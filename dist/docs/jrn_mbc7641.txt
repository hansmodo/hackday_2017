Albert Luryea was killed in the battle of June 1st. Last summer when a bomb fell in the very thick of his company 
he picked it up and threw it into the water. Think of that, those of ye who love life ! The company sent the bomb to 
his father. Inscribed on it were the words, Albert Luryea, bravest where all are brave. Isaac Hayne did the same 
thing at Fort Moultrie. This race has brains enough, but they are not active-minded like those old Revolutionary 
characters, the Middletons^ Lowndeses, Rutledges, Marions, 
Sumters. They have come direct from active-minded fore 
fathers, or they would not have been here; but, with two or three generations of gentlemen planters, how changed 
has the blood become ! Of late, all the active-minded men 
who have sprung to the front in our government were immediate descendants of Scotch, or Scotch-Irish Calhoun, 
McDuffie, Cheves, and Petigru, who Huguenotted his name, 
but could not tie up his Irish. Our planters are nice fellows, but slow to move ; impulsive but hard to keep moving. 
They are wonderful for a spurt, but with all their strength, they like to rest.
