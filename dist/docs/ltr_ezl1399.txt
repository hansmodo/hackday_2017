MY DEAR FRIEND, On this day eight years ago, I wrote from the retirement of 
Sully to congratulate you on the joyful event that placed you in the highest station our country can bestow. I then enjoyed the proudest feelings that my 
friend, the friend of my youth, who never had forsaken me, should be thus distinguished, and so peculiarly fitted for it. 
</p><p>
How much greater cause have I to congratulate you at this period, for having so 
filled it as to render yourself more enviable this day than your successor, as it is 
more difficult to deserve the gratitude and thanks of the community than their congratulations. You have most decidedly 
deserved all of this. Being deprived, by the sickness of my child, from joining the 
multitude to-day in paying my respects where they are due, I feel the sweetest 
consolation in devoting myself to you. My heart clings to you, my beloved friend, 
and has done so for the last fortnight, with a selfishness that produces the keenest 
feelings of regret, and though my domestic habits, more than inclination, have prevented my taking advantage of your kind 
invitations to be more with you, yet I felt a security and pleasure in being so near 
you, and a confidence in your affection, that constituted my chief pride as a citizen, I assure you. But the period has at 
length arrived when we must again part. You will retire from the tumult and fatigue of public life to your favorite retreat 
in Orange County, and will carry with you principles and manners not to be put off with the robe of state, having been drawn 
from maternal breasts, and nurtured from the example of those dear, pious parents, 
to whom you ever resigned yourself with such filial obedience and devotion as to 
bring their blessings on your head. Talents such as yours were never intended 
to remain inactive ; on retiring from public life, you will form a more fortunate arrangement of your time, be able to display 
them in the more noble and interesting walks of life. You will cherish them, my dear friend, in a more native soil ; they 
will constitute the chief felicity of your dear, venerated husband, and descend in 
full perfection to your son. I remember at this moment, in my last conversation 
with my venerable uncle, your father's friend, he said of you, " She will hold out 
to the end ; she was a dutiful daughter, and never turned her back on an old 
friend, and was charitable to the poor." Will you do me the favor, dear Dolly, 
for it is near my heart that you should, take advantage of some leisure moment 
to say something for me to your husband. In the fullness of my gratitude I can ex 
press nothing, but shall ever hold in remembrance the highly valued friendship 
and confidence he has shown my husband. 
I rejoice to hear that you do not leave the city very soon, and may hope to enjoy 
your society, though I presume your engagements are most numerous just now. I must ask your pardon for thrusting such 
an epistle upon you, but it relieves my heart, and will not, I trust, wound yours ; 
it demands no other acknowledgment, at present, than a cordial reception. It 
grows dark, and I want you to have this on this momentous evening. 
</p><p>
Believe me most truly yours, 
</p><p>
