My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I got back from Key West earlier than I anticipated 
by taking advantage of a small pilot boat that happened 
to be going to Charleston from Key West. In it we 
returned in four days, which contrasted somewhat with 
the passage out of eighteen days ; but the Gulf Stream 
was favorable in the first instance, but not in the latter. 
A few days ago I was ordered here and assigned to duty 
with the company that occupies the arsenal, and on the 
same day an order arrived from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> for one 
more company to sail for Arkansas Bay. Everybody 
supposed the Colonel would send the company to which 
I belonged, because we, its officers, are all young and 
unmarried, whereas the others were all differently situated ; but in army affairs age has precedence of merit, 
and an older Captain Burke was sent, leaving us again 
behind. There are still two companies at Ft. Moultrie ; 
and in case of a requisition for more men, we, or rather 
my old company, will certainly go, in which case I have 
the Colonel's promise that speedy notice will be given me, 
and I be ordered to go along. Also I am promised to go 
in case this company goes, thus securing two chances, 
which will inevitably enable me to go to Texas, in case 
more troops be required, and then most heartily will I 
give all the aid I can to further the views of Government 
to extend the "Area of Freedom." ... As to Texas 
having been annexed for the sole purpose of extending 
slavery, I do not believe. Some politicians may do so, 
and abolitionists may act upon that decision and affect 
it ; but if matters be permitted to take a natural course, 
the result will be as surely the reverse as water flows 
down hill. Your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
