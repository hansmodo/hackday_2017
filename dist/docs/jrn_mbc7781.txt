<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='31'>31st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=chester' rel='city origin'>CHESTER</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Mr. Priolcau Hamilton told us of a great 
adventure. Mrs. Preston was put under his care on the train. 
He soon found the only other women along were " strictly 
unfortunate females," as Carlyle calls them, beautiful and 
aggressive. He had to communicate the unpleasant fact to Mrs. Preston, on account of their propinquity, and was lost 
in admiration of her silent dignity, her quiet self-possession, her calmness, her deafness and blindness, her thoroughbred ignoring of all that she did not care to see. Some women, no matter how ladylike, would have made a fuss 
or would have fidgeted, but Mrs. Preston dominated the situation and possessed her soul in innocence and peace.

Met Robert Johnston from Camden. He has been a prisoner, having been taken at Camden. The Yankees robbed 
Zack Cantey of his forks and spoons. When Zack did not seem to like it, they laughed at him. When he said he did 
not see any fun in it, they pretended to weep and wiped their eyes with their coat-tails. All this maddening derision Zack said was as hard to bear as it was to see them ride off with his horse, Albine. They stole all of Mrs. Zack's 
jewelry and silver. When the Yankee general heard of it he wrote her a very polite note, saying how sorry he was 
that she had been annoyed, and returned a bundle of Zack's love-letters, written to her before she was married. Robert 
Johnston said Miss Chesnut was a brave and determined spirit. One Yankee officer came in while they were at break 
fast and sat down to warm himself at the fire. " Rebels have no rights/ Miss Chesnut said to him politely. " I 
suppose you have come to rob us. Please do so and go. Your presence agitates my blind old father." The man 
jumped up in a rage, and said, " What do you take me for a robber ? : " No, indeed, said she, and for very shame he marched out empty-handed.
