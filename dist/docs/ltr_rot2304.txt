At General Morris's, near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">Princeton</a>, 16th May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>.
</p><p>
MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend colleague">BURR</a>,
</p><p>
I wrote you, about three weeks ago, a very pressing letter, and
requested you to come for me here as soon as possible. My anxiety to
see you is extreme, and, lest my letter should have miscarried, I
cannot help troubling you with another. Every thing, my dear Burr, has
succeeded to my wishes. I have left Mr. Stockton upon the most
friendly terms imaginable, and I am still at General Morris's to avoid
expense, but am so situated that I cannot study. I assure you, my
future prosperity and happiness in life depends, in a greater measure
than you may imagine, on my living and studying with you; and the
sooner we get seated in some retired place, where we may live cheaply
and study without interruption, the better. I know myself--I think I
know you perfectly. I am more deceived than ever I was if we do not
live happily together, and improve beyond our most sanguine
expectations. Delay not, therefore, a single moment, my dear Burr, but
come for me yourself. A horse or a chair without you will be
unwelcome. I want to consult you about several matters of importance
to me before I leave this state. I say leave this state, for our
original plan of studying with Mr. Osmer appears the most rational to
me on many accounts.
</p><p>
I am so much attached to you, my dear Burr, and feel myself so much
interested in every thing which concerns you, that I believe, and hope
sincerely, it will be many years before we separate if we can once sit
down together. As long as my slender fortune will permit me to live
without business, we will, if you find it agreeable, enjoy the
pleasures of retirement. And when we enter on the theatre of the
world, why not act our parts together? Heaven grant that we may. I
repeat it again, my dearest friend, lose not a moment's time in coming
for me. It is painful to trespass so long upon General Morris's
bounty, though he be my friend, and I have not any means of stirring
an inch from him unless I walk. For fear you should not be at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=middletown" rel="city">Middletown</a>, I shall enclose a copy of this letter to Mr. Reeves, and
request him to forward it to you immediately if you should not be with
him.
</p><p>
With what pleasure did I receive yours of the 24th ult., at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">Princeton</a>,
the other day, when I went to pay Mr. Stockton a visit after his
return from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. I cordially congratulate you on the
improvement of your health by rash experiments. May it be as well
established as my own, which is perfectly capable of the closest
application. But I was not a little mortified to find you say nothing
about your intention to ride to Jersey. Let me entreat you once more
to set off as soon as possible. Every moment is precious, and ought to
be employed to advantage. I shall wait for you with the greatest
impatience; and, in the meantime, I am, what I always wish to be,
</p><p>
Your affectionate and sincere friend,
</p><p>
