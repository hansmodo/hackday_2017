<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='11'>11th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Drove with <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> and all her infant family; wonderfully clever and precocious children, with 
unbroken wills. At one time there was a sudden uprising of the nursery contingent. They laughed, fought, and 
screamed. Bedlam broke loose. <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> scolded, laughed, and cried. She asked me if my husband would 
speak to the President about the plan in South Carolina, which everybody said suited him. No, <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a>, said 
I. " That is what I told <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a>," said she. " Colonel Chesnut rides so high a horse. Now Browne is so much 
more practical. He goes forth to be general of conscripts in Georgia. His wife will stay at the Cobbs's.

Mrs. Ould gave me a luncheon on Saturday. I felt that this was my last sad farewell to Richmond and the people 
there I love so well. <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> sent her carriage for me, and we went to the Quids together. Such good things were 
served oranges, guava jelly, etc. The Examiner says Mr. Ould, when he goes to Fortress Monroe, replenishes his 
larder; why not? The Examiner has taken another fling at the President, as, " haughty and austere with his 
friends, affable, kind, subservient to his enemies." I wonder if the Yankees would indorse that certificate. Both 
sides abuse him. He can not please anybody, it seems. No doubt he is right.

My husband is now brigadier-general and is sent to South Carolina to organize and take command of the re 
serve troops. C. C. Clay and L. Q. C. Lamar are both spoken of to fill the vacancy made among <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis's</a> aides 
by this promotion.

To-day, Captain Smith Lee spent the morning here and gave a review of past Washington gossip. I am having such a busy, happy life, with so many friends, and my friends are so clever, so charming. But the change to that 
weary, dreary Camden! Mary Preston said: " I do think Mrs. Chesnut deserves to be canonized; she agrees to go 
back to Camden." The Prestons gave me a farewell dinner; my twenty-fourth wedding day, and the very pleasantest day I have spent in Richmond.

Maria Lewis was sitting with us on Mrs. Huger's steps, and Smith Lee was lauding Virginia people as usual. As 
Lee would say, there " hove in sight Frank Parker, riding one of the finest of General Bragg's horses ; by his side 
Buck on Fairfax, the most beautiful horse in Richmond, his brown coat looking like satin, his proud neck arched, 
moving slowly, gracefully, calmly, no fidgets, aristocratic in his bearing to the tips of his bridle-reins. There sat 
Buck tall and fair, managing her horse with infinite ease, her English riding-habit showing plainly the exquisite pro 
portions of her figure. " Supremely lovely," said Smith Lee. " Look at them both," said I proudly; " can you 
match those two in Virginia? " " Three cheers for South Carolina! " was the answer of Lee, the gallant Virginia sailor.
