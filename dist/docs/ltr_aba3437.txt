MY DEAR MRS. SMITH, 
</p><p>
I received, by Mr. King, your letter of December 
30th. I am uneasy if I do not hear from you once 
a week, though you have not any thing more to tell 
me than that you and your little ones are well. I 
think you do perfectly right in refusing to go into 
public during the absence of Colonel Smith. The 
society of a few friends is that from which most 
pleasure and satisfaction are to be derived. Under 
the wing of parents, no notice would be taken of 
your going into public, or mixing in any amusement ; but the eyes of the world are always placed 
upon those whose situation may possibly subject 
them to censure, and even the friendly attentions of 
one's acquaintance are liable to be misconstrued, so 
that a lady cannot possibly be too circumspect. I 
do not mention this to you through apprehension 
of your erring, but only as approving your determination.

I should spend a very dissipated winter, if I were 
to accept of one half the invitations I receive, particularly to the routes, or tea and cards. Even 
Saturday evening is not excepted, and I refused an 
invitation of that kind for this evening. I have been 
to one assembly. The dancing was very good ; the 
company of the best kind. The President and 
Madam, the Vice-President and Madam, Ministers of 
State, and their Madams, &c. ; but the room despicable ; the etiquette, it was difficult to say where it 
was to be found. Indeed, it was not <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; 
but you must not report this from me. The managers have been very polite to me and my family. I 
have been to one play, and here again we have been 
treated with much politeness. The actors came and 
informed us that a box was prepared for us. The 
Vice-President thanked them for their civility, and 
told them that he would attend whenever the President did. And last Wednesday we were all there. 
The house is equal to most of the theatres we meet 
with out of France. It is very neat, and prettily 
fitted up ; the actors did their best ; " The School 
for Scandal '' was the play. I missed the divine Farren ; but upon the whole it was very well performed. On Tuesday next I go to a dance at Mr. Chew's, and on Friday sup at Mr. Clymer's ; so you 
see I am likely to be amused. 
</p><p>
We have had very severe weather for several 
weeks ; I think the coldest I have known since my 
return from abroad. The climate of Old England 
for me ; people do not grow old half so fast there ; 
two-thirds of the year here, we must freeze or melt. 
Public affairs go on so smoothly here, that we 
scarcely know that Congress are sitting ; North Carolina a little delirious, and Virginia trying to give 
law. They make some subject for conversation ; 
but, after all, the bluster will scarcely produce a 
mouse. 
</p><p>
Present me kindly to your mamma and sisters. 
How I long to send for you all, as in days past ; my 
dear little boys, too. As to John, we grow every 
day fonder of him. He has spent an hour this 
afternoon in driving his grandpapa round the room 
with a willow stick. I hope to see you in April. 
Congress will adjourn in March, and it is thought 
will not meet again till December. 
</p><p>
Good night, my dear. Heaven's blessings alight 
on you and yours, 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
