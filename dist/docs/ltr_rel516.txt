                                Sewell's Mountain, October 7, 1861.

I received, dear Mary, your letter by Doctor Quintard, with the cotton
socks.  Both were very acceptable, though the latter I have not yet
tried.  At the time of their reception the enemy was threatening an
attack, which was continued till Saturday night, when under cover of
darkness we suddenly withdrew.  Your letter of the 2d, with the yarn
socks, four pairs, was handed to me when I was preparing to follow,
and I could not at the time attend to either.  But I have since, and
as I found Perry in desperate need, I bestowed a couple of pairs on
him, as a present from you.  the others I have put in my trunk and
suppose they will fall to the lot of Meredith [His cook--a servant from
the White House], into the state of whose hose I have not yet inquired.
Should any sick man require them first, he shall have them, but Meredith
will have no one near to supply him but me, and will naturally expect
that attention.  I hope, dear Mary, you and daughter, as well as poor
little Rob, have derived some benefit from the sanitary baths of the
Hot.  What does daughter intend to do during the winter?  And, indeed,
what do you?  It is time you were determining.  There is no prospect
of your returning to Arlington.  I think you had better select some
comfortable place in the Carolinas or Georgia, and all board together.
If Mildred goes to school at Raleigh, why not go there?  It is a good
opportunity to try a warmer climate for your rheumatism.  If I thought
our enemies would not make a vigorous move against Richmond, I would
recommend to rent a house there.  But under these circumstances I
would not feel as if you were permanently located if there.  I am
ignorant where I shall be.  In the field somewhere, I suspect, so I
have little hope of being with you, though I hope to be able to see
you....  I heard from Fitzhugh the other day.  He is well, though his
command is greatly reduced by sickness.  I wished much to bring him
with me; but there is too much cavalry on this line now, and I am
dismounting them.  I could not, therefore, order more.  The weather
is almost as bas here as in the mountains I left.  There was a drenching
rain yesterday, and as I had left my overcoat in camp I was thoroughly
wet from head to foot.  It has been raining ever since and is now
coming down with a will.  But I have my clothes out on the bushes and
they will be well washed.

The force of the enemy, by a few prisoners captured yesterday and
civilians on the road, is put down from 17,000 to 20,000.  Some went
as high as 22,000.  General Floyd thinks 18,000.  I do not think it
exceeds 9,000 or 10,000, though it exceeds ours.  I wish he had
attacked us, as I believe he would have been repulsed with great loss.
His plan was to attack us at all points at the same time.  The rumbling
of his wheels, etc., was heard by our pickets, but as that was customary
at night in the moving and placing of his cannon, the officer of the
day to whom it was reported paid no particular attention to it,
supposing it to be a preparation for attack in the morning.  When day
appeared, the bird had flown, and the misfortune was that the reduced
condition of our horses for want of provender, exposure to cold rains
in these mountains, and want of provisions for the men prevented the
vigorous pursuit and following up that was proper.  We can only get
up provisions from day to day--which paralyses our operations.

I am sorry, as you say, that the movements of the armies cannot keep
pace with the expectations of the editors of papers.  I know they
can regulate matters satisfactorily to themselves on paper.  I wish
they could do so in the field.  No one wishes them more success than
I do and would be happy to see them have full swing.  I hope something
will be done to please them.  Give much love to the children and
everybody, and believe me.

                          Always yours,
