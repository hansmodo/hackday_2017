Our lawful (?) owners have at last arrived. About 
sunset, day before yesterday, the Iroquois anchored 
here, and a graceful young Federal stepped ashore, 
carrying a Yankee flag over his shoulder, and asked 
the way to the Mayor's office. I like the style! If 
we girls of <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> had been at the landing, 
instead of the men, that Yankee would never have 
insulted us by flying his flag in our faces ! We would 
have opposed his landing except under a flag of 
truce; but the men let him alone, and he even found 
a poor Dutchman willing to show him the road ! 
</p><p>
He did not accomplish much; said a formal demand would be made next day, and asked if it was 
safe for the men to come ashore and buy a few necessaries, when he was assured the air of <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> was very unhealthy for Yankee soldiers at night. 
He promised very magnanimously not to shell us out if we did not molest him; but I notice none of 
them dare set their feet on terra firma, except the officer who has now called three times on the Mayor, and who is said to tremble visibly as he walks the streets.

Last evening came the demand : the town must be 
surrendered immediately ; the Federal flag Must be 
raised; they would grant us the same terms they 
granted <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>. Jolly terms those were! The 
answer was worthy of a Southerner. It was, "The 
town was defenseless; if we had cannon, there were 
not men enough to resist; but if forty vessels lay at 
the landing, it was intimated we were in their 
power, and more ships coming up, we would not 
surrender; if they wanted, they might come and 
Take us ; if they wished the Federal flag hoisted over 
the Arsenal, they might put it up for themselves, the 
town, had no control over Government property." 
Glorious ! What a pity they did not shell the town ! 
But they are taking us at our word, and this morning 
they are landing at the Garrison.

"All devices, signs, and flags of the Confederacy 
shall be suppressed." So says Picayune Butler. 
Good. I devote all my red, white, and blue silk to the 
manufacture of Confederate flags. As soon as one is 
confiscated, I make another, until my ribbon is exhausted, when I will sport a duster emblazoned in 
high colors, "Hurra! for the Bonny blue flag!" 
Henceforth, I wear one pinned to my bosom not 
a duster, but a little flag; the man who says take it 
off will have to pull it off for himself; the man who 
dares attempt it well ! a pistol in my pocket fills 
up the gap. I am capable, too. 
</p><p>
This is a dreadful war, to make even the hearts of 
women so bitter! I hardly know myself these last 
few weeks. I, who have such a horror of bloodshed, 
consider even killing in self-defense murder, who 
cannot wish them the slightest evil, whose only 
prayer is to have them sent back in peace to their 
own country, / talk of killing them ! For what 
else do I wear a pistol and carving-knife? I am afraid 
I will try them on the first one who says an insolent 
word to me. Yes, and repent for it ever after in sack 
cloth and ashes. 0! if I was only a man! Then I 
could don the breeches, and slay them with a will! 
</p><p>
If some few Southern women were in the ranks, they 
could set the men an example they would not blush 
to follow. Pshaw ! there are no women here ! We are 
all men !
