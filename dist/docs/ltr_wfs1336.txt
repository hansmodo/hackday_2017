Report No. 41. 
<p></p>
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
MEXICO, December 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a> 
<p></p>
SIR: 
<p></p>
As I had apprehended (in Report No. 37), Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston's train has returned without one 
blanket, coat, jacket, or pair of pantaloons, the small 
depot at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a> having been exhausted by the 
troops under Generals Patterson, Butler, and Marshall, respectively, all fresh from home or the Brazos, 
and, as in the case of other arrivals, since June, with 
out clothing ! The regiments that came with me must, 
therefore, remain naked, or be supplied with very in 
ferior garments, of every color and at high prices, as 
we may possibly be able to find the poor materials, 
and cause them to be made up here. This disappointment may delay any distant expedition for many 
weeks; for some of the new volunteers are already 
calling for essential articles of clothing. 
<p></p>
Referring again to former letters on the subject, I 
beg leave to add that every old regiment forwarded, 
more than a twelvemonth ago, its usual annual requisition for clothing, which has never arrived, or it has 
been issued as above. With excessive labor I had 
brought the old regiments volunteers as well as regulars favored by our long and necessary halts at Yera 
Cruz, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">Puebla</a>, to respectable degrees of 
discipline, instruction, conduct, and economy. The 
same intolerable work, at general headquarters, is to be 
perpetually renewed, or all the credit heretofore acquired by this army for moral conduct, as well as skill 
and prowess in the field, will be utterly lost by new 
arrivals, and there is now no hope of bringing up to the 
proper standard distant posts and detachments. These 
cannot be governed by any written code of orders or 
instructions, sent from a distance. I do not mean to 
accuse the reinforcements, generally, of deficiency in 
valor, patriotism, or moral character. Far from it; 
but among all new levies, of whatever denomination, 
there are always a few miscreants in every hundred, 
enough, without discipline, to disgrace the entire mass, 
and what is infinitely worse the country that employs 
them. My daily distresses under this head weigh me 
to the earth. 
<p></p>
I am about to send a detachment, the 9th Infantry, 
under Colonel "Withers, to Pachuca, near the great 
mines of Eeal del Monte, some fifty miles to the north 
east. There is an assay office at Pachuca, to which a 
large amount of silver bullion is soon to be brought, 
and if we have not troops present, the Federal officers 
of Mexico will seize the assay duties to our loss. I 
shall send another detachment in a few days to occupy 
Toluca, the capital of this State, with the general object of securing the contribution claimed for our mili 
tary chest. See General Orders, No. 376, paragraph 
5. I am nearly ready to publish the details promised 
in the tenth paragraph of that order. I have found 
them very difficult to obtain and to methodize. 
<p></p>
There will, I apprehend, be no difficulty in collect 
ing at the assay offices and mints within our reach the 
ordinary internal dues on the precious metals. As to 
other internal dues and taxes (not abolished by my 
order, JSTo. 376), I propose to find the net amount paid, 
to the Federal Government, for example, by the State 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1843">1843</a>, and to assess that sum, in mass, 
upon the State, to be paid into our military chest, a 
twelfth at the end of every month, by the State Government, and so of the other States which are or may 
be occupied by our troops. Each State will be required 
to collect the amount claimed, according to the Federal 
assessment for the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1843">1843</a>, under certain penalties, 
which may be the seizure, without payment, of the 
supplies needed for the support of the occupation, and 
particularly the property of the State functionaries, 
Legislative and Executive, with the imprisonment of 
their persons, etc., etc., etc. The fear is, those functionaries may abdicate, and leave the States without 
Governments. In such event, the like penalties will 
be, so far as practicable, enforced. 
<p></p>
The success of the system on the details of which 
I am now, with ample materials, employed depends 
on our powers of conciliation. With steady troops I 
should not doubt *the result; but the great danger 
lies in the want of that quality on the part of the new 
reinforcements, including the recruits of the old regiments. The average number of disorders and crimes, 
always committed by undisciplined men, with inexperienced officers, may destroy the best-concerted plans, 
by exasperating the inhabitants, and rendering the 
war, on their part, national, interminable, and desperate. 
<p></p>
It will be perceived that I do not propose to seize 
the ordinary State or city revenues ; as that would, in 
my humble judgment, be to make war on civilization ; 
as no community can escape absolute anarchy without 
civil government, and all government must have some 
revenue for its support. I shall take care, however, 
to see that the means collected within any particular 
State or city for that purpose are moderate and reasonable. 
<p></p>
It cannot be doubted that there is a considerable 
party in this country in favor of annexing it entire to 
the United States. How far that desire may be reciprocated at home, I know not, and it would be imperti 
nent in a soldier to inquire. I am here (whilst I remain) to execute the military orders of my Government. 
But, as a soldier, I suppose it to be my duty to offer a 
suggestion on the subject, founded on professional and 
local knowledge, that may not occur to the minds of 
statesmen generally. 
<p></p>
Annexation and military occupation would be, if 
we maintain the annexation, one and the same thing, 
as to the amount of force to be employed by us ; for if, 
after the formal act, by treaty or otherwise, we should 
withdraw our troops, it cannot be doubted that all 
Mexico, or rather the active part thereof, would again 
relapse into a permanent state of revolution, beginning 
with one against annexation. The great mass of this 
people have always been passive under every form of 
government that has prevailed in the country, and the 
turbulent minority, divided into ins and outs, particularly the military demagogues, are equally incapable 
of self-government, and delight in nothing but getting 
power by revolution, and abusing that power when 
obtained. 
<p></p>
I still entertain the belief that propositions, looking 
to a peace, will be submitted by the incoming Government here, in all the next month ; but that any conces 
sion of boundaries, satisfactory to the United States, 
would, on the withdrawment of our forces, create a 
revolt, or the overthrow of that Government, with a 
nullification of the treaty, I hold to be events more 
than probable. In the mean time it would be highly 
advantageous to me, officially, to have an early intimation of the views of our Government as to the terms of 
a treaty that would now be satisfactory, only to prevent 
a wrong distribution of the troops in respect to those 
unknown views. 
<p></p>
I have received no acknowledged communication 
from the Department. The letter of the 17th ultimo, 
published, as I have heretofore mentioned, in a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a> newspaper, has not come to hand, but I am daily 
expecting a mail up from that city. 
<p></p>
I have the honor to be, etc., etc.,
