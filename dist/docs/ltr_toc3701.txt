</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The peculiar situation and circumstances, "with which 
this State for several years last past has been attended, induce me to address your Excellency on a subject, which nearly concerns her interest, and may 
have its influence on the common cause of the States 
of America. 
</p><p>
Placing the highest confidence in your Excellency's 
patriotism in the cause of liberty, and disposition to 
do Cfual right and justice to every part of America, 
who have by arms supported their rights against the 
lawless power of Great Britain, I herein transmit the 
measures by which this State has conducted her policy for the security of her frontiers ; and, as the design and end of it were set on foot, and have ever 
since been prosecuted, on an honorable principle (as 
the consequences will fully evince), I do it with full 
confidence that your Excellency will not improve it 
to the disadvantage of this truly patriotic, suffering 
State; although the substance has already been communicated by Captain Ezra Heacock, employed by 
Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>, by your Excellency's particular 
direction, and who arrived here with the resolutions 
of Congress of the 7th day of August last, which appeared in some measure favorable to this State. 
</p><p>
I then disclosed to Mm the measures this State 
had adopted for her security, which, I make no doubt, 
have by him been delivered to your Excellency ; and 
though I do not hesitate that you are well satisfied 
of the real attachment of the Government of this 
State to the common cause, I esteem it nevertheless 
my duty to this State, and the common cause at 
large, to lay before your Excellency, in writing, the 
heretofore critical situation of this State, and the 
management of its policy, that it may operate in your 
Excellency's mind as a barrier against the clamorous 
aspersions of its numerous, and in many instances 
potent adversaries. 
</p><p>
It is the misfortune of this State to join on the Province of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a> and the waters of the Lake Chaplain, 
which affords an easy passage for the enemy to make 
a descent, with a formidable army, on its frontiers, 
and into the neighbourhood of the several States of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, who 
have severally laid claims in part, or in whole, to this 
State, and who have used every art which they could 
devise to divide her citizens, to set Congress against 
her, and finally to overturn the Government, and 
share its territory among them. The repeated applications of this State to the Congress of the United 
States to be admitted into the Federal Union with 
them, upon the liberal principles of paying a just 
proportion of the expenses of the war with Great Britain, have been rejected, and resolutions passed e:v 
parte tending to create schisms in the State, and 
thereby embarrass its efforts in raising men and money 
for the defence of her frontiers, and discountenancing 
the very existence of the State. Every article belonging to the United States, even to pickaxes and 
spades, has been, by Continental Commissaries, ordered out of tills State, at a time when she was erecting 
a line of forts on her frontiers. At the same time, 
the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> evacuated the post of Skeneshorough, for the avowed purpose of exposing this 
State to the ravages of the common enemy. 
</p><p>
The British officers in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, being acquainted 
with the public disputes between this and the claiming States, and between Congress and this State, 
made overtures to General Allen in a letter, projecting that Vermont should be a Colony under the Crown 
of England, endeavouring, at the same time, to draw 
the people of Vermont into their interest. The same 
day General Allen received this letter (which was in 
August, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>), he laid it before me and my Council, 
who, under the critical circumstances of the State, 
advised that no answer, either oral or written, should 
be returned, and that the letter should be safely deposited till further consideration, to which General Allen consented. A few months after, he received a 
second letter from the enemy, and the same Council 
advised that General Allen should send both letters 
to Congress, inclosed in a letter under his signature ; 
which he did, in hopes that Congress would admit 
Vermont into the Union ; but they had not the desired effect. 
</p><p>
In the fall of the year, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, the British made a 
descent up the Lake Champlain, and captured the 
Forts George and Anne, and appeared in force on the 
Lake. This occasioned the militia of this State, most 
generally, to go forth to defend it. Thus the militia 
were encamped against the enemy near six weeks, 
when General Allen received a flag from them, with 
an answer to my letter dated the preceding July to 
General Haldimand, on the subject of an exchange 
of prisoners. This flag delivered a letter to General Allen from the Commanding Officer of the enemy, 
who were then at Crown Point, with proposals for a truce with the State of Vermont, during the negotiating the exchange of prisoners. General Allen sent 
back a flag of his to the Commanding Officer of the 
British, agreeing to the truce, provided he would extend the same to the frontier posts of the State of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; which was complied with, and a truce 
took place, which lasted about three weeks. It was 
chiefly owing to the military prowess of the militia of 
this State, and the including the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
in the truce, that <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> and Schenectady did not 
fall a sacrifice to the ambition of the enemy that campaign. 
</p><p>
Previous to the retiring of the enemy into winter quarters, Colonel Allen and Major Fay were commissioned to negotiate the proposed exchange of prisoners. They proceeded so far as to treat with the British Commissioners on the subject of their mission, 
during which time they were interchangeably entertained with politics, which they treated in an affable 
manner, as I have been told. But no cartel was 
settled, and the campaign ended without the effusion 
of blood. 
</p><p>
The Cabinet Council, in the course of the succeeding winter, finding that the enemy in Canada were 
about seven thousand strong, and that Vermont must 
needs be their object the ensuing campaign, circular 
letters were therefore sent from the Supreme Executive Authority of this State, to the claiming States 
before mentioned, demanding of them to relinquish 
their claims to this State, and inviting them to join 
in a solid Union and Confederation against the common enemy. Letters were also sent to your Excellency, and to the States of Connecticul and Rhode 
Island. Each of these letters stated the extreme circumstances of this State, and implored their aid and 
alliance, giving them withal to understand, that it 
was out of the power of this State to lay in magazines, and support a body of men, sufficient to defend 
this State against the force of the enemy. But to 
those letters there has been no manner of answer returned. 
</p><p>
From all which it appeared, that this State was 
devoted to destruction by the sword of the common 
enemy. It appeared to be the more unjustifiable, that 
the State of Vermont should be thus forsook, inasmuch as her citizens struck the first offensive blow 
against British usurpation, by putting the Continent 
in possession of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and more than two hundred pieces of cannon ; with Crown Point, St. John's, 
and all Lake Champlain; their exertions in defeating 
General Carleton in his attempts to raise the siege 
of St. John's ; their assisting in penetrating Canada ; 
their valor in the battles of Hubbardton, <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>, 
and at the Landing, near <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>; assisting in 
the capture of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> ; and by being the 
principal barrier against the power of the enemy in 
Canada ever since. 
</p><p>
That the citizens of this State have by nature an 
equal right to liberty and independency, with the 
citizens of America in general, cannot be disputed. 
And that they have merited it from the United States, 
by their exertions with them in bringing about the 
present glorious Revolution, is as evident a truth as 
any other, which respects the acquired right of any 
community. 
</p><p>
Generosity, merit, and gratitude, all conspire in 
vindicating the independence of Vermont. But notwithstanding the arguments, which have been exhibited in sundry pamphlets in favor of Vermont, and 
which have been abundantly satisfactory to the impartial part of mankind, it has been in the power of 
her external enemies to deprive her of union, confederation, or any equal advantage, in defending themselves against the common enemy. 
</p><p>
The winter was thus spent in fruitless attempts to 
form alliances, but no advantages were procured in favor of this State, except that Massachusetts withdrew 
her claim, on condition that the United States would 
concede the independence of Vermont ; but that, if 
they would not, they would have their snack at 
the south end of its territory. Still <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and 
New Hampshire were strenuously opposed to the independence of Vermont ; and every stratagem in their 
power, to divide and subdivide her citizens, were exerted, imagining that their influence in Congress, and 
the certain destruction, as they supposed, of the inhabitants of this State by the common enemy, could 
not fail of finally accomplishing their wishes. 
</p><p>
In this juncture of affairs, the Cabinet of Vermont 
projected the extension of their claim of jurisdiction 
upon the States of New Hampshire and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
as well to quiet some of their own internal divisions 
occasioned by the machinations of those two governments, as to make them experience the evils of 
intestine broils, and strengthen this State against 
insult. The Legislature, accordingly, extended their 
jurisdiction to the eastward of Connecticut River to 
the old Mason line, and to the westward to Hudson's 
River; but, in the Articles of Union, referred the determination of The boundary lines of Vermont, and 
the respective claiming States, to the final decision 
of Congress, or such other tribunal as might be mutually agreed on by the contending Governments. These were the principal political movements of the 
last winter. 
</p><p>
The last campaign opening with a gloomy aspect 
to discerning citizens of this State, being destitute of 
adequate resources, and without any alliance, and 
from its local situation to Canada, obliged to encounter the whole force of that Province, or give up its 
claim to independence and run away, — Vermont, being thus driven to desperation by the injustice of 
those, who should have been her friends, was obliged 
to adopt policy in the room of power. And, on the 
1st day of May last, Colonel Ira Allen was sent to 
Canada to further negotiate the business of the exchange of prisoners, who agreed on a time, place, and 
other particulars relating to the exchange. While he 
was transacting that business, he was treated with 
great politeness, and entertained with political matters, 
which necessity obliged him to humor, in that easy 
manner that might serve the interest of this State in 
its extreme critical situation, and that its consequences 
might not be injurious to the United States. The 
plan succeeded ; the frontiers of this State were not 
invaded ; and Lord George Germain's letter wrought 
upon Congress, and procured that from them, which 
the public virtue of this people could not. 
</p><p>
In the month of July last. Major Joseph Fay was 
sent to the British shipping, on Lake Champlain, who 
completed an exchange of a number of prisoners, who 
were delivered at <a href='/results.php?city=skenesborough' rel='city'>Skenesborough</a> in September last: 
at which time and place Colonel Allen and Major 
Fay had a conference with the British Commissioners. 
And no damage, as yet, had accrued to this or the 
United States from this quarter. And, in the month 
of October last, the enemy appeared in force at Crown 
Point and <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> ; but were manoeuvred out of their expedition, and are returned into winter-quarters in Canada, with great safety ; that it might be 
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, "I will 
put my hook in their nose, and turn them back by 
the way which they came, and they shall not come 
into this city (alias, Vermont), saith the Lord." 
</p><p>
It remains that I congratulate your Excellency, and 
participate with you in the joy of your capturing the 
haughty Cornwallis and his army ; and assure your 
Excellency that there are no gentlemen in America 
who enjoy the glorious victor}'' more than the gentlemen of this State, and him who has the honor to 
subscribe himself your Excellency's devoted and 
</p><p>
Most humble servant,
