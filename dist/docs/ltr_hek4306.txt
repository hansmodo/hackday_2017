My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It is with the most sincere satisfaction that I congratulate you on the unconditional adoption of the Constitution by the Convention of this State. The 
particulars of this important event are contained in this clay's paper, herein inclosed. 
</p><p>
Messrs. Jay, Hamilton, and the rest of the federalists, have derived great honor from their temperate 
and wise conduct during the tedious debate on this subject. Nor ought those gentlemen who were opposed to the Constitution in the first instance, but 
afterwards voted for its adoption, be deprived of their due share of praise for their candor and wisdom in assuming different conduct, when it became apparent 
that a perseverance in opposition would most probably terminate in civil war ; for such, and nothing short of it, were the prospects. 
</p><p>
We have now, thank Heaven, eleven States which have adopted the system. Conduct and wisdom, almost superior to the lot of humanity, will be required 
in the first outset of the new Constitution. Congress will soon publish an ordinance for the necessary elections and organization. The times of election and 
period of organization will not be difficult to be determined; but the place where they shall assemble will be warmly contested. The two places generally 
thought on are <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. At present it is difficult to say in favor of which it will 
be determined. A few days more will explain the matter. 
</p><p>
I shall set out in a few days for the Province of 
Maine, and be absent six weeks or two months. On 
my return, I shall do myself the pleasure of addressing you. I have hitherto refrained from acknowledging the receipt of your kind favor of the 17th of 
June, as the affairs in the Convention were so gloomily circumstanced. But it is now dissipated. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> has most perseveringly opposed the Constitution ; and, from being in the majority during almost the whole time, he has found himself so much 
deserted as to be in the minority. A precise history 
of his conduct is difficult to be written, and must be 
left to him to explain. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Knox and her little family are well. She 
unites with me in presenting our affectionate respects 
to you and Mrs. Washington. I am, my dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your sincere friend and humble servant 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=hek" rel="me">Henry Knox</a>.
