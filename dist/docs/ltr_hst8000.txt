Sir : I have the honor to report to you that at early dawn this morning <a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="co-worker met">General Kearny</a>, with a detachment of the United States dragoons and <a href="/results.php?tla=ahg" rel="co-worker met">Captain Gillespie's</a> company of mounted riflemen, had an engagement with a very considerable Mexican force near this camp. 
</p><p>
We have about eighteen killed and fourteen or fifteen wounded ; several so severely that it may be impracticable to move them for several days. I have to suggest to you the propriety of 
despatching, without delay, a considerable force to meet us on the route to San Diego, via the Soledad and San Bernardo, or to find us at this place ; also, that you will send up carts or some 
other means of transporting our wounded to San Diego. We are without provisions, and in our present situation find it impracticable to obtain cattle from the ranches in the vicinity. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="co-worker met">General Kearny</a> is among the wounded, but it is hoped not dangerously ; Captains Monroe and Johnson, First Dragoons, killed ; Lieutenant Hammond, First Dragoons, dangerously 
wounded. I am, sir, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=hst" rel="me">H. S. Turner</a>, 
</p><p>
Captain U. S. A., comdg.<br>
Commodore R. F. Stockton, U. S. Navy, San Diego.
