Dear Jn.
</p><p>
Your letter by Mr. Beale came today to hand and I feel gratified by your notice I am now occupying a seat in the Convention of California from the San Joaquin District--having been elected during my absence to this place, and the honor being conferred I could do no less than attend this body--although sacrificing much valuable time.
</p><p>
I have been as active to accomplish my desires as my means would admithad not "Dame fortune" deserted me when I disposed of my property to come home prior to the tursting of our "gold buble," I might now have been in the states with more than a competency. As it is, I lose nothing by perserving and am in hopes to gether a small share of the harvest here.
</p><p>
A discovery has lately been made by <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Col Fremont</a> in my opinion equal to the first discovery of gold here, viz, the discovery of a vein at the head of the River Mariposa on which is situated his ranch purchased from the former Mexican Gov. Alvarado, proving to the world our mines can never be exhausted--new discoveries are being made daily, and our population [is] increasing rapidly.
</p><p>
We have now been sitting since the 3rd Sept. having present 44 members from the ten districts and will probably close our laboure by the 1st Oct. but I am fearful not in time to send our Constitution to Washington by the Oct steamer.
</p><p>
The slave question is forever settled here, no involuntary servitude and we have even gone so far as to exclude the free Negro race from emigrating here. The incorporation of Banks and monopolies have received their [...?...]
</p><p>
Our seat of Gov. will be located most probably at San Jose de Guadaloupe and our elections for state officers as well as Senators and Representatives will be held at the same time the Constutution will be put before the people for their acceptance or refection. The election will come off the first week in November. The most prominent candidate for the Senate is <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Col. Fremont</a> who will certainly receive a larger vote than any man in this country. He will fill the office of commissioner to settle our Southern boundary until another is appointed, considering his services were demanded before the appointment arrived.
</p><p>
You must not consider me vain when I write there is no man in our district [who] can cut a wider swath than I can and I am determined to use my influence for his elevation. California may through him receive her dues--but I am decidedly opposed to assist in hoisting any man to that office who has never seen it rain in this country. We have some shrewd old political hacks who even concocted a ticket of Panama for the future representation of Cal. We do not fear them and they will probably receive as sure a defeat as the occasion calls for.
</p><p>
Now my own prospects. I have since my return secured lots in San Jose, Stockton, and New York of the Pacific (no force) besides now locating a town on the San Joaquin, the prospects of which are flattering--having also purchased with others part of Castro's grant at the head of navigation in the San Joaquin, intending to lay out another town by the time steamers are put on that river. That co. is composed of Blair, Hammond, <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Fremont</a>, [...?...], and myself. I drew this co. together and the material with little expense is among us to compete with any co. in California for the advance of this district. Last April I established on the Tuolumne river a trading post as a gap to the Merced and Mariposa mines, controlling all the Indians between the Tuolumne and Merced river by which a lucrative business has been done. But two days ago a reprot was brought me [that] our Indians had gathered in one day 38 pounds of gold, but I have no certain a/c from my partners of their success since I have been here.
</p><p>
Last April we were the first to settle so far south, but one short month and thousands had crowded in below us, necessarily drawing business and trade to our door. I am anxious the elections were over, desirous of wintering in the mountains, having closed out all interest in San Francisco and owning no property except at San Jose south of the San Joaquin of any value.
</p><p>
When I returned from Mazatlan last Feby. I fortunately found myself part owner of a water and Beach lot in San Francisco and the other owners I immediately bought out, the lot then costing me $400. In the last week of August, I sold the same lot for $9000, every foot under water--San Francisco will eventually be much injured by locations further up the Bay. But its present advanced state and the amount of capital invested there, will hold business until steam navigation is introduced and all our rivers navigated and steam tow boats to take shipping afore San Francisco Bay and up to Pablo Bay through Carquenez Straits to Benecia or Marteniz and possibly through Suisune Bay to New York of the P.
</p><p>
The emigration is now arriving and many ore settling in our district and quite a friendly contention exists whether Sacramento or San Joaquin has the greatest population. Those two as by apportionment of delegation and apportionment of representation in our Legislature those districts will be equal to the other eleven.
</p><p>
Being on the Special Committee for reporting a constitution, I can promise the strengths of this new state will be in the hands of those two districts. Thomas Lloyd Vermule whose family you may know is also a delegate here from my district. He will probably be in the first Legislature.
</p><p>
I have not attempted to distinguish myself by speechifying here but have reserved a silence in my seat and out of doors will turn my hand to none in using desirable influence--A still tounge shows some wisdom--If I could but sit by you one hour it would be more satisfactory to both and many interesting points that do not now strike me would form a continuity of thought and conversation be developed and my great excuse for not writing or keeping up a correspondence is an inability to do so to my satisfaction. The time is nothing, the labor a pleasure, but habit is confirmed and a greater task I could not undertake. But to you a duty prompts.
</p><p>
The policy of purchasing or ordering goods in New York is impractable besides the great proportion of our trade consumes nothing but Mexican goods, the Indians having aped the fashions of the Californiansl. Our trade is extensive as I first started. We are the pioneers in that quarter and it was not until <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Fremont</a> came up the valley from the South did people feel it safe to work in small detached parties. His name was "Legion" and on rushed the "Diggers." Aside from the influence I controlled people came confidently forward which has resulted in such immense discoveries to the south.
</p><p>
That I can go to the first Senate of this new state I do not doubt and to you I say I can, but I am not desirous of that fame. My feeling have been much gratified at taking my seat here, proving to my friends at home that I have grown with this country, but my pocket must be better lined and time is too precious although the pay would be considered an object in any other state, "honor thrown in."
</p><p>
I have now 31 lots at the place where the seat of Gov. will be located, San Jose, bought last May and not quite a [...?...] I have in Stockton, one of our most thriving inland commercial towns 13 lots variously valued from $400 to $1500 dolls and upon the introduction of steamers will advance 50 pr. ct. Other valuable property I have besides my regular business and not one cent in debt so you see a foundation is now laid that by attention the coming winter I shall again be "about."
</p><p>
The remnant of the $500 dolls. you so kindly advanced me rolled itself into a Ball of such magnitude that now the property drawn together by me in that small remnant I had in my pocket when I landed at San Francisco would now amt. to at S. Francisco valuation over $200,000.
</p><p>
What prompted me to sell was a desire to come home, induced by constant solicitations from my family, but it is passed, and here am I at it again, led by "hope" and a sanguine disposition of future success--at any rate a satisfaction I am not idle.
</p><p>
The Monmouth [...?...] Mining Co., composed of Red Bankers principally, have not as a Co. been successful, finding, as many have who arrived here with the expectation of picking up gold any where without trouble find it a more serious matter than anticipated. I do not think candidly our mineral resources have as yet been half developed, new arriving that gold is being found now on the coast range--hertofore alone found on the Sierra Nevada. Again at the head of Trinity Bay gold has been discovered and the mines generally rich, besides our vast silver and quicksilver mines.
</p><p>
Should you be desirous of a splendid operation forward immediately a steamer of the same style as the [...?...]. $40,000 would be paid this day for her in full blast here and steamers of that description will for a long time be in demand. 100 steamers for the Bay and rivers will only increase instead of diminishing business. Europe has not awakened and what will we do for transportation for our population. Again should the steamboat business be over done in the Bay, such a boat as the one built to cross New York Bay would be the very boat for our coast trade from San Francisco, <a href="/results.php?city=monterey">Monterey</a>, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, San Pedro (the port of Los Angeles) and San Diego.
</p><p>
The moment our Gov. is established, the mail contract for the coast the passengers and freight would form a most lucrative business. It certainly will pay should such a scheme not be put in operation until the elapse of eight months--All the boats now afloat are inadequate and too little power. Think of this and should you by inquiry and information be induced to enter into it I should be happy to hear by return steamer and then will state the interest I should desire in the speculation.
</p><p>
Sept. 26th -- <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Col. Fremont</a> leaves for San Francisco this morning and I find him a steady business young man. Much respected and thought of by his friends--Ned Beale is here, he will probably come flying with our Constitution to Washington. We have told him here he can take a seat in our first Legislature, but a young wife at home is the "magnet." Please remember me affectionately to Uncle and your family, and should you see any of my family, say my health is unimpaired and hopes alluring. I shall write them by Beale.
</p><p>
Very respectfully, yr obdt servt,<br/>
