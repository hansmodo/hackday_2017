Early this morning the body of a dead man was found near our tent, no unusual occurrence.
<p></p>
Having promised a friend that I would accompany him to the Mission De Lones, about three miles distant, I dressed myself in a Christian style, doffing my red shirt and slouch hat, ate some bread and drank some water for breakfast, and then proceeded to the office of my friend. He not being quite ready, I strolled up towards the post office. A vast crowd had assembled and placed themselves in a line long before the office had been opened; and when the window opened, every man awaited his turn with the greatest impatience. The line was long enough to keep the last ones waiting until
after dinner and so I walked away, concluding that I stood no chance then.
<p></p>
After walking over the hills about an hour through sand ankle deep, we reached the mission, and found it to be a village of about three hundred inhabitants, with several long, low, one-story mud houses, all belonging to the church and rented out to families; some as dwellings, others as stores, hotels and gambling houses. We attended church, the first church I have been in for about eight months. The outside presented no unusual appearance but upon entering, the eye was dazzled by the vast amount of gilding presented to view; a great number of images were very handsomely gilded; the altar was splendid and over the centre a very sparkling diamond was placed. The Catholic Church ceremony was thoroughly performed, and during the greater part of it, the choir played upon their violins, drums and triangles.
<p></p>
After church we fell in with a good party of Americans formerly belonging to the Navy, but now surveying out here. They treated us well, informed us that fandangos took place there every Sunday evening except during Lent; and this being Lent season, they had procured especial permission from the priest to hold one on the previous Sunday evening, by paying him one hundred pounds of church candles, and he would grant no more unless well paid. Two or three scrub races and a shooting match took place, however, in the afternoon.
<p></p>
On arriving in the city I went to the post office, and finding the crowd of the morning considerably scattered, determined to enter the line and try my luck. I waited a little over an hour before getting to the window and then received a few papers and proceeded to Happy Valley, making my supper on bread and water.
