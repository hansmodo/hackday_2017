MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
WHAT would I not give for an arrival from America, 
or for certain advice from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> of the appointment 
of a ministry, or for the arrival here of a minister to 
sign the definitive treaty ? 
</p><p>
9 June. 
</p><p>
What would I not give for an arrival from America, or for advice from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> what the ministry in 
tend to do ? Mr. Hartley is now here, but we ad 
vance slowly to the definitive treaty. I can now have 
no hopes of seeing you before late in the fall. If the 
acceptance of my resignation arrives, as I expect, 
and we finish the peace as soon as I can reasonably 
hope, I shall not now be able to embark before October. The affairs of the world have little complaisance for my happiness or yours, but it is not worth our 
while to be impatient, because it will do us no good. 
I am astonished, however, that we have nothing from 
Congress nor from you. If you and your daughter 
were with me, I could keep up my spirits ; but idly 
and insipidly as I pass my time, I am weary, worn, 
and disgusted to death. I had rather chop wood, dig 
ditches and make fence upon my poor little farm. 
Alas, poor farm and poorer family, what have you 
lost, that your country might be free, and that others 
might catch fish and hunt deer and beaver at their 
ease ? 
</p><p>
There will be as few of the tears of gratitude or 
the smiles of admiration or the sighs of pity for us 
as for the army. But all this should not hinder me 
from going over the same scenes again upon the 
same occasion, scenes which I would not encounter 
for all the wealth, pomp and powers of the world. 
Boys ! if you ever say one word or utter one com 
plaint, I will disinherit you. Work, you rogues, and 
be free. You will never have so hard work to do as 
papa has had. Daughter ! get you an honest man for 
a husband and keep him honest. No matter whether 
he is rich, provided he be independent. Regard the 
honor and the moral character of the man, more 
than all other circumstances. Think of no other 
greatness but that of the soul, no other riches but 
those of the heart. An honest, sensible, humane 
man, above all the littlenesses of vanity and extravagances of imagination, laboring to do good rather 
than be rich, to be useful rather than make a show, 
living in a moderate simplicity clearly within his 
means, and free from debts or obligations, is really 
the most respectable man in society, makes himself 
and all about him the most happy. 
</p><p>
I long to see my dear John, as much as the rest, 
but he is well at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, and I cannot go to him, 
nor do I think it prudent to bring him to Paris. 
</p><p>
I have accomplished a correspondence between the 
Royal Society of Medicine here and the republican 
one at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, at the desire of Dr. Tufts, but have 
not yet found a careful hand to send the diploma. 
Adieu, adieu, adieu.
