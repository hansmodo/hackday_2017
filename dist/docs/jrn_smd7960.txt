It is bad policy to keep us from seeing the prisoners; it just sets us wild about them. Put a creature 
you don't care for in the least, in a situation that 
commands sympathy, and nine out of ten girls will 
fall desperately in love. Here are brave, self-sacrificing, noble men who have fought heroically for us, 
and have been forced to surrender by unpropitious 
fate, confined in a city peopled by their friends and 
kindred, and as totally isolated from them as though 
they inhabited the Dry Tortugas! Ladies are naturally hero- worshipers. We are dying to show these 
unfortunates that we are as proud of their bravery 
as though it had led to victory instead of defeat. 
Banks wills that they remain in privacy. Consequently our vivid imaginations are constantly occupied in depicting their sufferings, privations, hero 
ism, and manifold virtues, until they have almost 
become as demigods to us. Even horrid little Captain C- - has a share of my sympathy in his 
misfortune ! Fancy what must be my feelings where 
those I consider as gentlemen are concerned! It is 
all I can do to avoid a most tender compassion for a 
very few select ones. Miriam and I are looked on 
with envy by other young ladies because some 
twenty or thirty of our acquaintance have already 
arrived. To know a Port Hudson defender is considered as the greatest distinction one need desire. 
If they would only let us see the prisoners once to 
sympathize with, and offer to assist them, we would 
never care to call on them again until they are liberated. But this is aggravating. Of what benefit is it 
to send them lunch after lunch, when they seldom 
receive it? Colonel Steadman and six others, I am 
sure, did not receive theirs on Sunday. We sent with 
the baskets a number of cravats and some handkerchiefs I had embroidered for the Colonel.

Brother should forbid those gentlemen writing, 
too. Already a dozen notes have been received from 
them, and what can we do? We can't tell them not to. 
Miriam received a letter from Major Spratley this 
morning, raving about the kindness of the ladies of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, full of hope of future successes, and 
vows to help deliver the noble ladies from the hands 
of their oppressors, etc. It is a wonder that such a 
patriotic effusion could be smuggled out. He kindly 
assures us that not only those of our acquaintance 
there, but all their brother officers, would be more 
than happy to see us in their prison. Position of 
affairs rather reversed since we last met !
