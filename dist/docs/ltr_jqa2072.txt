TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 35 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, May 1st, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
The immediate destiny of this country remains unsettled, 
and as no events of material importance become public, 
there is little intelligence to be given that deserves communication. The fate of this country and indeed of all Europe 
appears to be suspended upon operations, the course of 
which is not at present discovered. Curiosity, faction, and 
interest are busied in every part of Europe to penetrate, to 
color, and to invent measures of policy for the sovereigns of 
this hemisphere. Every hour of the day has its rumor, 
which becomes more or less accredited, and among the numerous and contradictory reports which are all circulated 
with the same degree of confidence, it is extremely difficult 
to distinguish between those which are founded in truth, and 
those that are false. 
</p><p>
My last letters have mentioned the circumstance of at 
tempts at sedition, practised at the same time on the first 
day of the last month at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, as well as 
in many other parts of France and Holland. The immediate 
occasion which produced the riotous symptoms here was a 
report, that peace had been concluded between France and 
the King of Prussia, and that the French had by the treaty at 
least determined to abandon the party who have recently 
under their auspices effected a revolution of government 
here. It was indeed true that at that time a treaty of peace 
was upon the point of conclusion between those two powers, 
and that it has since been signed and ratified. But its 
public articles contain no arrangement whatever relative 
to this Republic. It is probable that the secret articles are equally silent upon the subject, or that they postpone the definitive arrangement until the period of a general pacification. 
</p><p>
But the present government find themselves very much 
distressed by the situation of their affairs. The alliance 
with France which they have been so long soliciting is not 
made; the conditions for it amount to no less than a considerable dismemberment of a territory already so small as 
to be very ill qualified to suffer diminution. The mutual 
dissatisfaction between the parties is daily increasing. The 
demands which have been made by the Committee of Public 
Safety as the basis of the alliance are so great, so burdensome 
to the interests, and so derogatory to the independence of 
the people, that the opinion is not without plausibility, 
which supposes they are intended only for the purpose of 
postponing any positive engagement whatever, and that 
the French policy is to keep the affairs of this country really 
in their own hands, so that they may be at any time arranged 
in such a manner as may be most advantageous to the interest of France. 
</p><p>
The King of Prussia, besides his intimate and double 
connection with the Stadtholderian family, is with Great 
Britain bound by the treaty to support the Constitution 
of this Republic as it was settled in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>. The party of the 
former government here became more and more sanguine 
in their hopes that he will restore the Stadtholder by means 
of an armed force. They are still convinced that it has been 
a subject of negotiation in the late treaty, and that the 
French have by secret articles consented to the return of 
the Stadtholder. The universal opinion of the party is in 
itself of no weight. The utmost extravagance of a fairy tale 
is the essence of probability, in comparison with the stories 
which these people receive and propagate with equal eagerness every hour of the day. But in this instance there are 
circumstances which serve to give at least a color of plausibility to their hopes. The most important of these circumstances are the difficulty raised against the conclusion 
of the French alliance and the conduct of the King of Prussia. With respect to the first I have mentioned the reasoning that is held ; the latter has certainly a suspicious appearance 
to say no more. The army under General Mollendorf is stationed in Westphalia, close upon the frontiers of this country and within three days march of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. The 
question is why has that Army been placed there? It is not an usual station for an army, and since the peace with France they cannot be left there to protect the territory, 
since that can be in no danger. The conclusion drawn from this argument is, that this army is destined to restore the Stadtholder. 
</p><p>
There is a rumor current at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> of a fact still more decisive. The present States General have sent letters of 
recall to most of the public Ministers of the former government, and among others to Mr. de Reede, the Minister at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=berlin" rel="city">Berlin</a>. The report is, that when he presented those letters to the King of Prussia his Majesty told him to pay no sort 
of attention to them, that he should still consider him as the 
Minister of the United Provinces, that he did not acknowledge the present pretended government of this country, 
and required him to give them notice of it. Whether this 
account is accurate or not I have not been able to ascertain, but I have reason to suppose it not without foundation. 
</p><p>
The reasoning upon these premises stands thus. The King of Prussia is bound by the treaty to guaranty the 
ancient Constitution of this country, that is to protect the Stadtholder. The French have expelled the Stadtholder, 
and the present government have abolished the office. But 
France and Prussia have made a peace ; that peace necessarily implies either that France shall abandon the Dutch 
Patriots, or that Prussia shall abandon the Stadtholder. 
The conduct of both parties furnishes evidence that the 
former has been done. The French government avoids 
all engagements with the Patriots, which can entitle them 
to demand a continuance of assistance. The King of 
Prussia formally refuses to recognize the present government there, and has sent a powerful army to be ready when 
ever he shall think proper to enforce his disavowal. 
</p><p>
These circumstances have perhaps contributed to maintain and to strengthen the opinion which is very common 
here and in France, that the governments of that country 
and of Prussia .are agreed upon the restoration of the Stadt holder and of the former government here. But on the other 
hand a member of the Committee of Public Safety has most 
explicitly declared that the rumor was utterly destitute of 
foundation, and that it was invented and propagated by a 
calumny equally malignant and absurd. It is also said to 
be as unequivocally for the interest of Prussia, that the 
Patriots here should be supported, as it is for that of France. 
The restoration of the Stadtholder would only give these 
provinces again to Great Britain. This is well known to the 
Prussian Cabinet by experience. Since the Revolution 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a> the British government has been much more absolute 
at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> than in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, whereas that of Prussia, so far 
from possessing the smallest particle of influence, has been 
repeatedly unable to obtain justice upon several complaints. 
Prussia might have prevented in all probability the success 
of the French armies and their arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, had 
she been so disposed, and it is the utmost extravagance to 
suppose that what neither of the two powers would do, merely to avoid or prevent the expulsion of the Stadtholder, 
they should now have agreed to for his restoration. 
</p><p>
I am informed from persons to whom the true state of affairs is certainly known, that the alliance with France is 
expected to be brought to a conclusion within a week or ten days. Should this expectation be realized, the present 
order of things in this country will doubtless acquire a stability which it has hitherto wanted. If it should continue to 
be delayed, the rumors and suspicions I have mentioned will acquire some small degree of probability. It is at least 
certain, as I have already had the honor of writing you more than once, that the present administration will accept the 
treaty upon any conditions be they what they may, and therefore if the Treaty is not soon finished, it will be because 
the French government are determined not to conclude. 
</p><p>
The national sentiment in this country is universally sub 
ordinate to the spirit of party. On my arrival here I was 
somewhat surprised to see an invaded country, in which 
one half the nation was panting for the success of the invaders, and placing the summit of their happiness in being 
conquered. The actors have since changed, but the scene 
is the same ; and I still see one half the nation whose only 
hope consists in the prospect of being conquered again. The 
hatred of the opposite faction is stronger than the love of 
country, and this political passion is so universal, that the 
only individuals I have met with who could be named as 
exceptions are equally obnoxious to both parties. 
</p><p>
The European horizon, which has for a moment had the 
appearance of clearing up, seems at present to threaten a 
deeper gloom than ever. Russia is said to be upon the point 
of a rupture with the Turks and with Sweden, perhaps with 
Prussia. The Baron de Stael has been received by the National Convention, as ambassador extraordinary from the 
King of Sweden with the French Republic. The Russian 
system is well known, and although it must eventually 
clash with that of Great Britain, it is supposed that those 
two powers are like to unite from the coincidence of their 
present immediate pursuits. Thus the empire of the earth 
and of the ocean is to be attained in concert, and divided 
by agreement, and the question which of the parties shall 
eventually grasp the whole to be left for the decision of 
futurity. 
</p><p>
I have the honor &c. 
</p><p>
