CAMP NEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>, 
April 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a>. 
</p><p>
We have been as busy as a light infantry company 
on drill ever since we arrived eleven days ago. Such 
a night as last night I have never known in all my 
soldiering. We were at tea in my mess tent just be 
fore sunset when suddenly one of our furious tropical 
storms struck us perfectly unexpectedly. I ran, leaving my mess mates laughing at my haste. In a moment 
more, however, their tent was prostrated over their 
heads, the dishes, tea, sugar, etc., with all the sun 
dries of the mess chest which was open, the lid serving 
for a table, in one amorphous mass under a perfect 
deluge of rain. In the meantime, I had reached my 
tent which unaided I was endeavoring to secure. I 
had barely time to roll my bed in an oil cloth, when 
the tent pins on the windward side began to yield, 
the rain driving in upon me in torrents. Edmund L 
at this moment arrived from under the mess tent and 
with the assistance of a few men we managed to 
secure our frail house. We had just moved our camp 
into a corn field newly ploughed, the soil an adhesive 
clay, and by the time I had in some measure secured 
my baggage which old soldierlike, I first attended 
to the water was some inches deep, or rather there 
was a soft adhesive mortar bed, about ankle deep, 
over the whole camp. The rain and gale were still at 
their worst, when I began looking about to see " the 
state of the nation." In every direction the tents 
were overthrown and their contents scattered in the 
mud. My own company had almost entirely disappeared, a few despairing wretches, groping about in 
the mud for their arms, were all that were left. The 
fires were extinguished and desolation reigned through 
out the camp. In an hour or two the storm somewhat 
abated, fires were rekindled and efforts made to repair 
damages, but to little purpose. The arms were put 
in forming order and the men sat or stood about in 
miserable groups, without any possibility of sleeping, 
and at reveille this morning our whole brigade was 
marched to the works, it being our detail on a large 
fortification, which we are constructing as rapidly as 
possible. . . . We are here neither in a state of peace 
nor war. Our pickets and patrols have exchanged 
some shots, and several deserters have been killed in 
endeavoring to cross the river. The Mexican author 
ities have shot or hung one of our Dragoons as a 
spy. He was in truth a deserter and was executed in 
retaliation for one of their soldiers, who, they say, 
was shot by one of our patrols. This needs confirmation. We contend with one annoyance that is almost 
insupportable. We are completely overrun with 
wood ticks. I am sure I pull out of my flesh on an 
average fifty per day. They annoy some persons but 
slightly, me, they poison wherever they bite. My 
person looks as if I had the confluent smallpox. Here 
is tattoo. . . .

April i p. The aspect of Mexican and Oregon affairs 
changes more frequently than the moon. Perhaps 
one of them depends upon the other. If England 
and Uncle Sam settle the Oregon question, Mexico 
may be more readily induced to treat on the subject 
of Texas; but if John Bull and Brother Jonathan 
get by the ears, our yellow neighbors aided and 
sustained by English guineas will probably persist 
until, as they boast, their eagles are planted on the 
Sabine. . . .

Since I wrote last, matters have had a serious war 
like tendency. General Ampudia who relieved General 
Mejia in command at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> has sent a dispatch 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>, requiring him to retreat in twenty- 
four hours, and adding that his refusal to do so would 
be considered a declaration of war. This, of course, 
was not acceded to by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>, who replied 
that he had been sent here by his Government and 
should remain ; that if Ampudia chose to attack him, 
the consequences must rest on his own head and upon 
the Mexican nation. The next day, it is said, a 
courier arrived with orders superseding General Ampudia, and placing General Arista in command of the 
Northern army. So that General Ampudia has retired 
in disgust.

On the tenth Colonel Truman Cross, Department 
Quarter-Master General, left camp unattended, for a 
ride. He was seen in the course of the morning about 
three miles up the river, but has not since been heard 
from. Every effort has been made to ascertain his 
fate, but as yet we have not discovered the slightest 
clue to it. It was hoped for some days that he was a 
prisoner at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>, but we now know he is not 
there. He has undoubtedly been killed, the first victim of annexation. This melancholy event has cast a 
gloom over the whole camp. Lieutenant Deas swam 
the river a few days since and is now a prisoner.

We are very strongly posted here though still in a 
ploughed field and extremely dirty and uncomfortable. 
The camp is very healthy, not a man in the whole 
army has died since we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Corpus Christi" rel="city">Corpus Christi</a>. . . .

April 22. Colonel Cross s remains have been found 
and were brought to camp last evening. He was 
murdered by banditti.
