Sunnyvale Calif. <br> Oct 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> Thur. A.M. <br><br> My dear Son, <br> Your note written a month ago at hand. Am glad for a note and then we are wondering 
what has happened in the meantime. We are still having the finest weather and 
nothing doing much but just live along. I hope you are keeping well we are hoping 
you will take all the care possible of your health and occasionally we hear that 
the boys will be home for Xmas but I know better then that although paper reports 
are much more encouraging. You are not as near to Berlin as you should be to make 
a final and lasting settlement. The usual winter trouble with grippe has brought 
about a great deal of trouble for everyone [unintelligible] and his [unintelligible] 
have been quite sick but are getting better. The Crater family have all been down 
but are well again. We think Jay is near the place where you were first located. 
Have had a letter from Mrs Boyer saying she is coming West on a visit with a view 
to locate somewhere in one of the coast towns if she likes the climate. Of course 
she will. All the soldiers [unintelligible] they get no mail but I suppose it 
can’t be helped. We are all of us hoping for a change for the better. Your father 
will write in the course of the week so you will receive at least one home letter 
a week. We are hoping to be able to send a Xmas box but the label must come from 
you this the R.C. Perhaps later on we may be able to send something. With much 
love from the both of us. <br><br> Lovingly Mother.
