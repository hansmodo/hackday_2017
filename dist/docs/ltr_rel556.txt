My Precious Little Agnes:  I sat down to give my dear little Sally--
for she is dear to me in the broadest, highest sense of the word--the
benefit of Jeremy Taylor's opinion on hasty marriages.  But, on
reflection, I fear it would be words lost, for your mother says her
experience has taught her that when a young woman makes up her mind
to get married, you might as well let her alone.  You must, therefore,
just thank her for the pretty inkstand, and say that I'll need no
reminder of her, but I do not know when I shall make up my mind to
stain it with ink.  I was very glad to receive your letter of the 26th,
and to think that you were mindful of us.  I know you do not wish to
be away, though you are striving to get as far away as possible.
When you reach Norfolk, you will be so convenient to New York, whence
steamers depart almost daily for Europe.  Let us know when you sail.
But I do not write to restrain your movements, though you know how
solitary I am without you.  I inclose...which, with what I gave Mildred,
I hope will answer your purpose.  Send me or bring me the photographs
I asked for.  I like them of the last edition; they seem to take with
the little school-girls, and I have nothing else to give them.  I
hope you will have a safe and pleasant trip.  Tell Mr. Warwick I shall
sorrow with him to-night--though I believe Mrs. Lee is right.  Remember
me to all friends, and believe me,
</p><p>
                      Your devoted father,           <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>.
