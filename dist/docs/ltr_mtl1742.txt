My DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a>: I closed and sent off my letter before I had finished all I had to say. Do 
not hint to K. or B., or any one else, my doubts of them, only watch them. As to S., so many false 
hoods are told in the papers that all the stuff about his wife and himself may be untrue. I 
hope it may prove so. I received a letter from Keyes this morning. I believe I wrote you that I had. How hard it is that I cannot see and 
talk with you in this time of great, great trouble. I feel as if I had not a friend in the world save 
yourself. * * I sometimes wish myself out of this world of sorrow and care. I fear my fine 
articles at B.'s are getting pulled to pieces and soiled. I do not wish you to leave N. Y. with 
out having the finest articles packed up and returned to me. The single white camel's hair 
shawl and the two Paisleys I wish returned to me, if none of them are sold. Do you think 
there is the least chance of their being sold? I will give you a list of the articles I wish 
returned to me from Mr. Brady's before you leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> for Washington.
