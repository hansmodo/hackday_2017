Hon. J. K. DuBois.

MY DEAR SIR:--In the summer of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1859">1859</a>, when Mr. Freeman visited
Springfield, Illinois, in relation to the McCallister and Stebbins
bonds I promised him that, upon certain conditions, I would ask
members of the Legislature to give him a full and fair hearing of his
case. I do not now remember, nor have I time to recall, exactly what
the conditions were, nor whether they were completely performed; but
there can be in no case any harm [in] his having a full and fair
hearing, and I sincerely wish it may be given him.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
