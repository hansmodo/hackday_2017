SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 28th inst. I have this moment received. Capt. 
Warren has written to you requesting the prisoners, mentioned in the 
list you enclosed, might be sent to Charlestown, except the dragoons, as 
they were exchanged by an agreement entered into the 23d instant, 
by which all citizens and militia of every rank and denomination, made 
prisoners of war previous to that date, southward of the Delaware 
River, with all the volunteers, and many Continental officers, a list of 
whose names will be immediately published by the Commissary of 
Prisoners. The safe-guard had certainly, by his conduct, forfeited 
his protection. I wish, however, you would send him to Gen. Leslie, 
with a remonstrance against the irregularities committed. Should 
there be an opportunity of injuring the enemy at the distillery, by a 
detachment from this army, I beg you will send me such intelligence 
as to enable me to give you the necessary aid. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, sir, with much esteem, your obdt. servant, 
</p><p>
