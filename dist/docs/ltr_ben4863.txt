DEAR SIR, Inclos'd I send you Dr. Priestly's last letter, 
of which a part is for you, he says ; but the whole seems as 
proper for you as for me. I did not advise him pro or con, 
but only explain' d to him my method of judging for myself 
in doubtful cases, by what I called Prudential Algebra.

If he had come to town, and preach'd here sometimes, 
I fancy Sir John P. would now and then have been one of his 
hearers; for he likes his theology as well as his philosophy. 
Sir John has ask'd me if I knew where he could go to hear 
a preacher of rational Christianity. I told him I knew several of them, but did not know where their churches were in 
town; out of town, I mention' d yours at Newington, and 
offer 'd to go with him. He agreed to it, but said we should 
first let you know our intention. I suppose, if nothing in his 
profession prevents, we may come, if you please, next Sunday ; 
but if you sometimes preach in town, that will be most convenient to him, and I request you would by a line let me know 
when and where. If there are dissenting preachers of that 
sort at this end of the town, I wish you would recommend one 
to me, naming the place of his meeting. And if you please, 
give me a list of several, in different parts of the town, perhaps 
he may incline to take a round among them. At present I 
believe he has no view of attending constantly anywhere, 
but now and then only as it may suit his convenience. All 
this to yourself. 
</p><p>
My best respects to Mrs Price and Mrs Barker. With 
sincere wishes for your health and welfare, I am ever, my dear 
</p><p>
Friend 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
