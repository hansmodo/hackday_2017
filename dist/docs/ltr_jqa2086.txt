MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
The total defeat of the emigrants who had effected a 
descent in Britanny, as mentioned in my last letter, and the 
peace between France and Spain, signed at Basle on the 22nd 
of July, and since ratified by both parties, are events of 
such consequence that they will be fully known in America 
before this letter can reach you. It is scarcely possible 
that any interesting intelligence should be first conveyed 
from hence to America. The local position of the country 
forbids it, and although I have constantly taken all possible 
pains to communicate the most recent news, as far as I can 
conjecture from the dates when I presume my letters 
have been received, I must conclude that in general they 
have only been corroborative of accounts contained in news 
papers already out of date. 
</p><p>
A circumstance which upon the brilliant theories of human 
perfectibility ought to be considered as much more important 
than either of the former, is the adoption by the Convention 
of the Constitution lately proposed by the Committee of 
Eleven. Several considerable alterations have been the result of a discussion which has lasted nearly two months, but 
the division of the legislative body into two Councils, and 
the attribution of the executive power to a third assembly of 
five persons with the title of Directory, are retained. The 
people and the armies are still to pronounce upon the whole 
plan, and then nothing will remain but to destroy it by 
another revolution, which will probably take place in less than a thousand years. 
</p><p>
It is worth remarking that in the midst of the deliberations 
upon this democratic constitution (for they still give it that epithet without any scruples,) the Great Sieyes, as one 
of my honest Dutch friends calls him, came out with another democratic Constitution, upon a plan entirely new and entirely his own. This prodigy of genius consisted in the 
invention of three or four new words, and in a sort of amalgamation of the system proposed by the Committee of 
eleven, with an institution similar to that of the Parliaments under the ancien regime. His legislature was to be 
merely a judicial tribunal, whose functions should be to decide between a petitioning assembly and a government. 
But as three assemblies were not enough for him, he proposed a fourth, whose sole functions should be to make such 
alterations as from time to time should be found necessary 
in the existing Constitution. The great Sieyes applauds 
himself and congratulates his country for having originated 
the luminous idea of this institution, and indeed some 
persons are of opinion that this Assembly would be more 
constantly busy than any of the others. The Convention, 
however, unanimously rejected the plan, and Sieyes the 
great has doubtless put it back into his porte-feuille, to be 
used upon the next occasion that shall offer for making a democratic constitution for France. 
</p><p>
He did not, however, suffer the occasion to pass by without repeating the elegant pleasantry of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="colleague">Franklin</a>, of Mirabcau, 
and of Condorcet, upon the system of balances. Upon this subject, together with an abundance of witticisms from the 
very refuse of commonplace, he advanced several things, for which it is impossible to say whether the credit is to 
be given partly to his ignorance, or whether it is all due to deliberate intention and a philosophical disregard for truth. 
</p><p>
He said for instance that the idea of separating the Constituent authority from that of the ordinary legislative power 
originated in France, that it was a glorious discovery for 
which all the credit was due to the French nation, and that it was made in the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1789">1789</a>. 
</p><p>
In his past-vamp d-future-old-reviv d-new piece of declamation against the balancing system, he says :
</p><p>
I shall not insist upon the example of England, because the 
hereditary stain that is annexed to the system there, is a defect 
not essential to the system itself and cannot fairly be charged to it, 
but only examine what the practical effect of the system is every 
where else where it is established. The double legislature is, as has 
been said, like two horses pulling the chariot in opposite directions. 
With all their pulling the chariot moves not an inch, until the 
royal coachman mounts the box. Now you do not chuse to have 
a royal coachman. Wherever this system prevails the legislative 
assemblies are mere formal shadows, and the real legislator is the executive power. 
</p><p>
These opinions, or pretended opinions, thus expressed, appear to me very remarkable, and they are the more so 
because they come from a man, who seems to affect the government of the earth, who has in fact that of France 
in a great degree, and who possesses all the qualities by which the late Roman historian says that Augustus was conducted to that of the world. 
</p><p>
The primary Assemblies who are to decide upon the Constitution are to be convoked on the 6th of next month, 
and the Constitutional Legislature is to be elected immediately after. The precipitation with which the business is 
conducted is grounded upon the necessity they are under to leave no time for the formation of cabals against the 
acceptance. There is another measure which cannot easily be reconciled with the Constitutional theory, but which 
may be legitimated by the omnipotent argument of necessity. At the first election for the Constitutional Legislature the 
choice of the people is not to have an unlimited liberty. 
</p><p>
Five hundred members of the present Convention must be chosen, or rather the Assembly has decreed that it will change 
itself into a Constitutional Legislature, one-third of the numbers of which are to be rcchosen, or changed, by a new 
election. They are afraid of the consequences that would result at the present moment from an appeal to the voice of 
the people, without prescribing two-thirds of what that voice must answer. 
</p><p>
Upon the same principle at one of the last sessions of 
the Convention they dissolved at one stroke all the popular 
societies throughout the Republic. Their books and papers 
are ordered to be delivered up to the respective municipalities, and the halls of their assembly arc to be shut up 
forever. Such is the present system. The popular societies have been the most efficacious of all the instruments employed by the tyranny under which France has recently 
suffered, and they are formally proscribed by the proposed 
constitution. But they appear not less than Archangel 
ruined, and are still extremely formidable. 
</p><p>
But the victory of the party called Moderates over that 
of the Jacobins is so nearly complete, that it has already 
divided itself into two parties, who are upon terms of mutual opposition, and may very soon be at open war. They 
consist on one side of the fragments of the Brissotine party, and on the other of the persons who contrived and 
executed the catastrophe of Robespierre, and who on that account are called the Thermidorian party. The present 
subjects of difference between them appear to be the different degrees of extension that they are disposed to give to the 
reaction of the Revolution. The Brissotines are the strongest in the Convention, but the other party seems to coincide 
more with the present temper of the popular opinion. The renewal of the legislative Assembly in two houses, and 
the supposed transition from a Revolutionary to a constitutional government, will undoubtedly be a critical moment, and will produce new political phenomena for observation. 
</p><p>
They suppose in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> that their peace with Spain will 
produce of necessity a rupture between the latter and Great 
Britain, as the cession of the Spanish part of St. Domingo is 
contrary to the Treaty of Utrecht, which will furnish a 
pretext, and the defenceless opulence of the Spanish commerce will give a motive to the British ministry. It seems 
as if no calculation can be too extravagant for the desperation 
of that government, but I have as yet no faith in their making 
war against Spain for the present, though there is no doubt 
but it is wished at Paris they may. 
</p><p>
They are also dissatisfied with the treaty between Great 
Britain and the United States, as I wrote you more than 
three months since that they would be, whatever the con 
tents of the treaty might be. At that time they did not 
blush to say that to be upon bad terms with Britain was 
an obligation of gratitude incumbent upon the United States ; 
and at present they are displeased with the articles because they are so with the treaty itself. 
</p><p>
What effects their influence will produce in America I 
know not. But that it will work with all its power, I am 
very certain. I have reason to suppose, however, that they 
think their two last Ministers in the United States have 
spent them too much money there, and the principal reason 
for which they recalled the last was the expense of his bad 
bargains, which have hitherto procured them nothing but 
grain and flour. Their new Minister's instructions will 
doubtless oblige him to greater economy. I know not 
whether they will lose their influence on that account. 
</p><p>
The present war is at this time nothing more in reality than 
a contest of national rivalship between France and Britain. 
The interest of all the maritime nations is opposed to the 
success of the latter, and the French naval power has suffered 
such heavy losses, and is so much reduced, that they can 
henceforth have no hopes of being able to resist that of their 
enemy, but by uniting all the maritime force in Europe with 
their own against it. They arc also desirous that the United 
States should be engaged on their side, for the benefit of an 
assistance negative in its nature, as Britain would be deprived of the great and growing profit of her commerce 
with us in the case of a war. The system of neutrality 
which has been pursued with so much firmness and per 
severance by the United States has never been perfectly 
relished by the French governing men. It becomes more 
and more unpleasant to them in proportion as the necessity 
of peace is felt more forcibly by themselves, and the policy 
employed by them for effecting their purpose is to attack 
the President of the United States. This has been, I am 
fully convinced, the real system from the time when Genet 
was sent, and it will be pursued with more or less consistency 
until they succeed in drawing us into a war, or until they 
shall be at peace. The art of destroying reputations, if it 
had not always been well understood in France, might have 
attained a considerable degree of perfection merely by the 
experience of their last years. It has been practised with 
such universal success among themselves, by all their 
parties and under all their changes, that it is reduced to a 
regular system, the operation of which is merely mechanical. 
</p><p>
The affairs of this country though intimately connected 
with those of France bear an aspect entirely different. The 
popular societies which are altogether proscribed in that 
Republic are very powerful here. There is now in session 
at this place an assembly styling itself a central club, consisting of deputies from most of the clubs throughout the 
Province ; there are others of the same kind in the other Provinces. The great object of their pursuit is the dissolution of the Provincial government, and the assembling 
of a National Convention for the whole people. This plan is extremely popular in this Province ; it has met how 
ever with strenuous opposition from five of the others, but will finally prevail by the means of the popular societies. 
</p><p>
In the meantime they are under a constant apprehension of being invaded on the part of Prussia. They have an 
army of twenty-five thousand French troops for their defence, but a great proportion of their own army has deserted. 
</p><p>
They have at length made their appearance with their naval armament, and by the junction of all the forces they 
could muster they were two or three days at sea with six or eight ships of the line and as many frigates. But the 
condition of the ships was such that they could scarcely keep above water, and upon the first suspicion of the approach of the British and Russian fleet they returned to 
the Texel, where they now remain. They have recently 
had one frigate taken after a severe action against superior force. 
</p><p>
Their commerce in the meantime is a mere passive victim to the British force at sea, and their East India Company is 
losing all their ships one after the other, without being able to lift a hand for their protection. 
</p><p>
The public treasury is empty. They have to pay between one and two hundred millions of florins for arrearages, the 
remainder of an hundred millions for the friendship of France, and the heavy expenses which daily accrue from their state 
of war, besides those to which they are at all times subjected. 
</p><p>
The plate of every individual has already been required 
for the public exigencies and delivered. A dry tax of six per 
cent upon all capitals is to be paid before the end of the year, 
and will be far from supplying the monies that are immediately wanted. The scarcity of provisions has been great, 
but much exaggerated ; there have not been the symptoms of a famine, and the harvest now gathering is uncommonly favorable. 
</p><p>
The scarcity has been also great in England. It is in 
conceivable how the government of that country retain all 
their force, and how the price of their funds is supported 
in the midst of their losses and defeats. Their naval success 
and the force of national antipathy are the only things that 
can account for it. They have not as yet discovered any 
intention whatever to negotiate with France, though it is 
pretended that a division has taken place in the Privy Council upon the subject. They are perhaps yet waiting for the 
result of new revolutions, which they expect will happen in 
France ; but they will probably find themselves deceived 
in their hopes arising from that source. The campaign 
of this year will probably be productive of scarce any 
important effect, and it is very certain that no country can 
support long a war with an annual expense of twenty-four 
million sterling to keep a status quo. In short the true state 
of facts appears to be, that France and Britain are both 
reduced to the greatest extremity, and that at present they 
both persist in war from the sole hope that the enemy will 
first yield to their pressure of misery. Such is the usual issue of war. 
I am, &c.
