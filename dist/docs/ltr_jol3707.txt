My dear General, 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival here the 25th ultimio, I found 
that men and money were still wanting to fit the 
Alliance frigate for sea. I immediately insisted on 
the necessity of an impress, and of having recourse 
to extraordinary means for the necessary supply of 
money. The head of the Navy Board, who is at the 
same time a leading member in the House of Representatives, gave me such positive assurances on both 
points, as tempted me to employ the interval of preparation in my visit to Newport. But, as I was returning, I was met with a letter informing me that 
the motion for an impress had been rejected. To 
add to our difficulties, the terror of an impress had 
cleared the port of seamen, and deprived us of the 
little succour we derived from the ships' rendezvous. 
</p><p>
In these circumstances, I was reduced to the necessity of soliciting <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> for authority to engage such volunteers from the Continental recruits 
of this place, and soldiers of the invalid corps, as 
might be qualified for the sea-service. I applied to 
Governor Hancock for similar authority with respect to a corps of State troops -which garrison the Castle. 
I addressed myself to the principal merchants, and 
tried every expedient that could be thought of As 
Governor Hancock could not act but with the authority of the General Court, I yesterday presented a 
memorial, and obtained permission to enlist twenty 
volunteers from the Castle guard. <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>, 
whose zeal in the service of his country is indefatigable, has condescendingly undertaken to use his personal influence in engaging the men, and has gone 
down to the Castle with a sum of specie, allowed by 
the General Court for that purpose ; if he is successful, we shall be able to go to sea with confidence. 
These men are the more necessary to us, as they are 
natives, and persons upon whose attachment we can 
depend, as a counterbalance to a number of British 
prisoners, who were admitted on board when the 
ship first began to be manned. 
</p><p>
I am, at all events, determined to insist on Barry's 
sailing with the first wind. I have admitted as many 
passengers as could be accommodated, on condition 
of their serving as volunteer marines. They will 
likewise be an additional security against the suspected part of our crew. 
</p><p>
1th. Captain Barry says that our ship is but barely manned. However, I am determined to embark 
to-day, and expect he will sail in the course of the 
week, wind and weather permitting. 
</p><p>
I have only time to entreat your Excellency to 
present my respects to Mrs. Washington; and accept 
the assurances of attachment with wliich I am unalterably yours, 
</p><p>
