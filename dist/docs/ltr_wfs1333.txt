SIR: 
<p></p>
I have heretofore reported that I had, August 24, 
concluded an armistice with President Santa Anna, 
which was promptly followed by meetings between Mr. 
Trist and Mexican commissioners appointed to treat 
of peace. 
<p></p>
Negotiations were actively continued with,. as was 
understood, some prospect of a successful result up to 
the 2d instant, when our commissioner handed in his 
ultimatum (on boundaries), and the negotiators adjourned to meet again on the 6th. 
<p></p>
Some infractions of the truce in respect to our supplies from the city, were earlier committed, followed 
by apologies on the part of the enemy. These vexations 
I was willing to put down to the imbecility of the government, and waived any pointed demands of reparation while any hope remained of a satisfactory termination of the war. But on the 5th, and more fully on the 
6th, I learned that as soon as the ultimatum had been 
considered in a grand council of ministers and others, 
President Santa Anna on the 4th or 5th, without 
giving me the slightest notice, actively recommenced 
strengthening the military defences of the city, in gross 
violation of the 3d article of the armistice. 
<p></p>
On that information, which has since received the 
fullest verification, I addressed to him my note of the 
6th. His reply, dated the same day, received the next 
morning, was absolutely and notoriously false, both in 
recrimination and explanation. I enclose copies of both 
papers, and have had no subsequent correspondence 
with the enemy. 
<p></p>
Being delayed by the terms of the armistice *more 
than two weeks, we had now, late on the Yth, to begin 
to reconnoitre the different approaches to the city, 
within our reach, before I could lay down any definitive plan of attack. 
<p></p>
The same afternoon a large body of the enemy was 
discovered hovering about the Molinos del Rey^ within 
a mile and a third of this village, where I am quartered 
with the general staff and "Worth's division. 
<p></p>
It might have been supposed that an attack upon 
us was intended ; but knowing the great value to the 
enemy of those mills (Molinos del Rey\ containing a 
cannon foundery, with a large deposite of powder in 
Casa Mata near them ; and having heard two days 
before that many church bells had been sent out to be 
cast into guns, the enemy's movement was easily understood, and I resolved at once to drive him early the 
next morning, to seize the powder, and to destroy the 
foundery. 
<p></p>
Another motive for this decision leaving the general plan of attack upon the city for full reconnaissance 
was, that we knew our recent captures had left the 
enemy not a fourth of the guns necessary to arm, all at 
the same time, the strong works at each of the eight 
city gates ; and we could not cut the communication 
between the foundery and the capital without first 
taking the formidable castle on the heights of Chapultepec, which overlooked both and stood between. 
<p></p>
For this difficult operation we were not entirely 
ready, and moreover we might altogether neglect the 
castle, if, as we then hoped, our reconnaissances should 
prove that the distant southern approaches to the city 
were more eligible than this southwestern one. 
<p></p>
Hence the decision promptly taken, the execution 
of which was assigned to Brevet Major-General Worth, 
whose division was reenforced with Cadwallader's brigade of Pillow's division, three squadrons of dragoons 
under Major Sumner, and some heavy guns of the siege 
train under Captain Huger of the Ordnance, and Captain Drum of the 4th Artillery two officers of the 
highest merit. 
<p></p>
For the decisive and brilliant results, I beg to refer 
to the report of the immediate commander, Major-General Worth, in whose commendations of the gallant 
officers and men dead and living I heartily concur ; 
having witnessed, but with little interference, their 
noble devotion to fame and to country. 
<p></p>
The enemy having several times reenforced his line, 
and the action soon becoming much more general than 
I had expected, I called up, from the distance of three 
miles, first Major-General Pillow, with his remaining 
brigade (Pierce's), and next Riley's brigade of Twiggs's 
division leaving his other brigade (Smith's) in observation at San Angel. Those corps approached with 
zeal and rapidity ; but the battle was won just as Brigadier-General Pierce reached the ground, and had in 
terposed his corps between Garland s brigade (Worth's division) and the retreating enemy. 
<p></p>
The accompanying report mentions, with just commendation, two of my volunteer aids Major Kirby, 
Paymaster, and Major Gaines, of the Kentucky Volunteers. I also had the valuable services, on the same 
field, of several other officers of my staff, general and 
personal: Lieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock, Acting In 
spector-General; Captain E. E. Lee, Engineer; Captain 
Irwin, Chief Quartermaster; Captain Grayson, Chief 
Commissary; Captain H. L. Scott, Acting Adjutant-General; Lieutenant "Williams, Aide-de-Camp ; and 
Lieutenant Lay, Military Secretary. 
<p></p>
I have the honor to be, etc., etc.,
