My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I am to thank you for your kind letter of the 6th 
inst., and the two camp shirts which accompanied it. 
The presumption which would lead me to pursue my 
project after what you have said upon it, would be 
unpardonable ; praying your forgiveness therefor, my 
dear friend, for the trouble which I have given you on 
this eccentric scheme, I renounce it as a thing which 
cannot be sanctified by your approbation. At the 
same time, I must confess to you that I am very 
sensibly affected by your imputing my plan in so large 
a degree to ambition. I declare upon my honor that 
I would not have desired any other than my present 
rank, and that I would even have taken the title of 
captain of an independent corps, for the pleasure of 
serving my country so usefully, as I fondly hoped I 
should have been able to do, had my scheme been 
carried into execution. 
</p><p>
The scarlet cloth, four camp shirts (in all), a roll of 
pomatum, a hair comb, two shirts for Berry, and a 
hunting shirt, have been received at different times, 
and I am exceedingly obliged to you for them. In 
future I will be more careful to thank you for such 
articles immediately after the receipt of them. 
</p><p>
The express is waiting only for my letter, which 
circumstance has obliged me to write in haste, and 
force me to take leave. I am 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate and dutiful 
</p><p>
