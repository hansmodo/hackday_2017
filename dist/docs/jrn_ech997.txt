Today has been Christmas, the day above all others for merrymaking throughout Christendom, but here we have spent it much unlike the merrymaking we have in our own distant home. For two or three days past we were fasting on hard fare under the promise of an excellent dinner for which the cooks and stewards have all been busy making preparations. So when we sat down, we were sadly disappointed in our pleasant anticipations. Although we had chicken and turkey, they were so few and far between that our shares amounted to but precious little, and with the addition of two small potatoes each, all arose from the table with appetites still craving.

Some fine dishes were prepared for the upper cabin and carelessly placed in a tempting position to hungry boys and so one of them disappeared. The Captain was immediately informed of the occurrence and came posthaste down to our cabin, swearing and cursing that he was "going to find out who did it or he would raise h!" The cook then charged our Jo Smith with the theft, but it was proven he was not in the neighborhood of the galley at the time of the occurrence. When the "old man" found out that he could not hit on the right one, it only more and more incensed him. He got into a terrible flurry and talked of "setting fire to the magazine and blowing up the whole ship, as he
had as many friends in hell as any one!" and made a perfect fool of himself by this kind of conversation. With this exception the day passed without any unusual occurrence, except one or two slight showers of rain. This evening the violin appeared, and with dancing, singing, and a little drinking, quite a time was had. Now, eleven o'clock, all is quiet and while I have been writing, my old comrade, Atkins, has made drinks of lemonade. I now take up my bowl to drink "a happy Christmas to friends we've left at home!"
