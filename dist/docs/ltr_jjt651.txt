My dear Sister
</p><p>
I returned last Tuesday evening from the White Sulphur Springs, and under the blessing of Providence my health had much improved, and if I only had a week more before the commencing of the session I would visit you but I would barely have had time to ride to your house and back, which would not have answered our purpose as my desire is to make a visit. But I hope that in November I will be with you. The first visit that I pay is to be with you. I feel that a disordered liver had probably much to do with my affected throat and if I can only keep the secretions right, I hope that my throat will soon be well.

Anna's health I fear has not improved much locally, though she gained some flesh during her stay at the Baths. Maj. Preston has just returned, and given me an account of you all. I am much gratified that Mr. Arnold invited him to stay with you. I regret that Mr. Arnold's arm continues to trouble him. I trust that you will succeed in securing a competent teacher for the children. Tell them that their aunt & I were wishing this week that we could see them.

Sulphur water appears to suit my disease better than any other remedy which I have met with, and yesterday evening Anna & myself took a ride to one of these springs about 8 miles from town. I never knew of its existence until within a few weeks. The water is very pleasant yet very weak and I fear not of much benefit.

I send you by the same mail with this letter one of our catalogues. Anna joins me in love to you all.

Your affectionate brother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjt" rel="me">Thomas</a>.
