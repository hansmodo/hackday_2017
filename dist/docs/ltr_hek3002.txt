SIR, 
</p><p>
A resolution, of the 30th ultimo, has been shown 
to me by some French officers attached to the corps of artillery under my command, ordaining that all officers of artillery, engaged by Mr. Deane in France, 
shall take rank, in the American artillery, according to the dates of their brevet commissions in the French service. 
</p><p>
I believe the Congress did not sufficiently consider 
the consequences of such a resolution, or that they 
had not full information to form it, consistent with 
that justice which is due their own officers. 
</p><p>
The French Minister of Marine, or Minister of the 
Colonial Department, gave these officers brevet commissions, to be in force in their Colonies only, or 
rather on this Continent, of superior rank to those 
which they then held in France, in order to give 
them an ideal rank here. They have had the rank 
given to them implied in their brevet commissions, 
and some higher than they expected. But this resolution of Congress gives them another superiority, 
which perhaps was not intended. Nearly all the Captains now in the Continental artillery served for the 
last two campaigns as Captain-Lieutenants, and are 
such only of that class as distinguished themselves 
by their abilities and special services. They are arranged, in the different battalions of artillery, according  to their seniority, but do not take rank as full 
Captains until the commencement of the present year ; 
whereas the French officers brevet commissions are 
dated in November and December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
The resolution of Congress pervades all the different ranks in the artillery, of Captains, Captain-Lieu 
tenants, and Lieutenants, and supersedes all the officers in these different stations. 
</p><p>
I confess that it surprises me much, and that I am 
totally unacquainted with the principles upon which 
it is founded. No military ones most certainly can be 
assigned. These French gentlemen, in general, have never been in so much actual service as the American officers, who are not accused of any demerits ; 
hut. on the contrary, their reputation, as a corps, is 
equal to any in the service. Why, then, should they 
all be superseded and disgraced ? They have exerted 
themselves to recruit their companies on the new establishment, and marched them to camp. 
</p><p>
I conceive the most fatal consequences will arise to 
the artillery, except this resolution be repealed, at 
least so far as respects the seniority of rank. All 
that can with propriety be done, is to give them commissions dated at the same time that Congress accepted their services. Any thing more will occasion the 
resignation of every officer of spirit in the corps, who, 
though they are actuated by every tie of attachment 
and interest in the service of their country, yet will 
infinitely prefer serving as volunteers, than under people who can have no other tie than the pay they receive, and who cannot give a single order that can 
be understood. 
</p><p>
In justice to the merit of the officers under my command, and to promote the good of the sendee, I make 
this representation to your Excellency, begging that 
you would be pleased to transmit it to the Honorable 
Congress for -their information. If they repeal the 
resolution, I shall be happy. If they do not, I shall 
be clear of any bad consequences which may follow. 
I am, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
