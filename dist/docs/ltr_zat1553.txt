My dear Dr 
</p><p>
I wrote you from Surralvo which place we left on the 13th  & reached 
here yesterday with Gen Twiggs command, Gen Worths will be here 
to-day & Gen Butlers I hope tomorrow, as well as the Texan Mounted 
Volunteers under Gov r Henderson should they not disband, a portion 
of them I apprehend at least will do so The Gov r as I informed you 
had been ordered to move up the San Juan to China to cross that river 
there, & unite with me at this place ; he informed me by the return of 
an individual who I sent said communication with, that he would leave 
China on the 14th  if so, he ought to be here tomorrow at furtherest ; but 
whether he does so or not I shall move day after to-morrow towards 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> & reach there the next day say the the 2o th it being only two 
days easy march, unless something which I do not calculate on should 
occur to prevent it Whether we shall meet with any opposition on 
our arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, or between here & that place is quite uncertain, 
but it would appear somewhat strange if they do not risk a battle for so 
important a place as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, which they have been fortifying for sev 
eral months, and where report says, they have six or seven thousand 
men, half of theMregulars. For the last two days several hundred variously reported by the inhabitants, from two hundred to a thousand have 
kept in our front, but have uniformly fallen back before our advance or 
spies consisting of fifty men ; they were only near enough on one occasion to exchange shots, & that almost out of reach of their balls taking 
effect, wounding slightly on our side one horse, & perhaps one or two 
individuals on theirs, as one of them dropped his gun and lance, which 
was picked up by our people But let matters terminate as they may, 
the story will be told in a few days 
</p><p>
A man with the mail got here last night from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a>, by which I 
rec d your esteemed favor of the y th ins 1 for which you have my sincere 
thanks, & I regret you did not hear from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a>, but truly hope all are 
well there. I am also very much concerned to learn there is so much 
indisposition or sickness which has in so many instances resulted fatally 
among the volunteers where ever they are located ; but had hoped those 
encamped at or near the mouth of the Rio Grande where they could get 
good water, or the best in the country, as well as plenty of wood & 
shade in addition to plenty of sea air as well as the regulars at Fort Polk, 
would have proved comparitively healthy ; but in this it seems I have 
been mistaken 
</p><p>
I rec d by the mail in question several letters public & private, but 
the information they contained was but of little importance ; the private 
ones I may say nothing. I did not hear from my family or from my 
manager I did not get the proceedings alth rec d in camp, by others 
of the court in case of Gen Gaines, judging from which & the presi 
dents remarks thereon I consider his conduct has been tolerated, but not 
approved, nor can it be said it amounts to an acquital, but barely tolerates his conduct 
</p><p>
I stated in my last letter to you, that that portion of the 2 d Inf 
which had reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a> & New Port Kentucky, had by an order 
from Washington been halted at those places until further orders, this 
report must have originated in some mistake, or if true it was only for a 
very brief period, as I rec d by the last nights mail an order from the 
Adj c Genl 8 office dated Washington the 24 ult ordering Cap Masons 
Company of the new Rifles which had been completed to the establish 
ment to join me, & to accompany the 2 d Infy or if it had left for Fort 
Polk, to follow it without delay, so that you may expect Riley daily if he 
has not already arrived 
</p><p>
I regret to hear of Ogdens & Dawsons indisposition but as they 
were on the mend, I trust they will be very soon restored to their usual 
health. I was quite pleased to learn that Col Baker 1 of the Illinois volunteers was in a fair way to recover from the injury he rec d at the hands 
of the Georgia Volunteers, & am sorry you did not carry out your 
intention of visiting him 
</p><p>
Wishing you & yours continued health & prosperity I remain truly 
</p><p>
your
