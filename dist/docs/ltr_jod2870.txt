THE post was later than usual to-day, so that I had not yours of July 24, till this evening. You have 
made me very happy, by the particular and favorable account you give me, of all the family. But I Don't 
understand how there are so many, who have no eruptions and no symptoms. The inflammation in the arm might do, but without these, there is no small pox. I 
will lay a wager, that your whole hospital has not had so much small pox as Mrs. Katy Quincy. Upon my 
word, she has had an abundance of it, but is finally recovered, looks as fresh as a rose, but pitted all over, as thick as ever you saw any one. I, this evening, 
presented your compliments, and thanks to Mr. Hancock, for his polite offer of his house, and likewise your compliments to his lady and Mrs. Katy.

Went this morning to the Baptist meeting, in hopes of hearing Mr. Stillman, but was disappointed. He was there, but another gentleman preached. His action 
was violent to a degree bordering on fury. His gestures unnatural and distorted. Not the least idea of 
grace in Ins motions, or elegance in his style. His voice was vociferous, and boisterous, and his composition almost wholly destitute of ingenuity. I wonder 
extremely at the fondness of our people for scholars educated at the southward, and for southern preachers. There is no one thing in which we excel them 
more, than in our university, our scholars and preachers. Particular gentlemen here, who have improved upon their education by travel, shine ; but in general, 
old Massachusetts outshines her younger sisters. Still in several particulars they have more wit than we. They have societies, the philosophical society particularly, which excites a scientific emulation, and 
propagates their fame. If ever I get through this scene of politics and war, I will spend the remainder of my days in endeavoring to instruct my country 
men, in the art of making the most of their abilities 
and virtues ; an art, which they have, hitherto, too much neglected. A philosophical society shall be 
established at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, if I have wit and address enough 
to accomplish it, sometime or other. Pray set brother Cranch's philosophical head to plodding upon this project. Many of his lucubrations would have been 
published and preserved, for the benefit of mankind, and for his honor, if such a club had existed.

My countrymen want art and address. They want knowledge of the world. They want the exterior and superficial accomplishment of gentlemen, upon which the world has set so high a value. In solia abilities 
and real virtues, they vastly excel, in general, any people upon this continent. Our New England people are awkward and bashful, yet they are pert, ostentatious and vain ; a mixture, which excites ridicule and gives disgust. They have not the faculty of showing themselves to the best advantage, nor Jie art 
of concealing this faculty ; an art and faculty which 
some people possess in the highest degree. Our deficiencies in these respects are owing wholly to the little intercourse we have with strangers, and to our 
inexperience in the world. These imperfections must be remedied, for New England must produce the heroes, the statesmen, the philosophers, or America will make no great figure, for some time.

Our army is rather sickly at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and we live in daily expectation of hearing of some great 
event. May God Almighty grant it may be prosperous for America. Hope is an anchor and a cordial. Disappointment, however, will not disconcert us.

If you will come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> in September, I will stay as long as you please. I should be as proud and happy as a bridegroom. 
</p><p>
Yours.
