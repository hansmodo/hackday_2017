<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='10'>10th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. General Gregg writes that Chickahominy was a victory manque, because <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> received a disabling wound and G. W. Smith was ill. The subordinates in command had not been made acquainted with the plan of battle.

A letter from John Chesnut, who says it must be all a mistake about Wade Hampton's wound, for he saw him in 
the field to the very last; that is, until late that night. Hampton writes to Mary McDuffie that the ball was ex 
tracted from his foot on the field, and that he was in the saddle all day, but that, when he tried to take his boot off 
at night his foot was so inflamed and swollen, the boot had to be cut away, and the wound became more troublesome than he had expected.

Mrs. Preston sent her carriage to take us to see Mrs. Herbemont, whom Mary Gibson calls her " Mrs. Burgamot." Miss Bay came down, ever-blooming, in a cap so formidable, I could but laugh. It was covered with a 
bristling row of white satin spikes. She coyly refused to enter Mrs. Preston's carriage to put foot into it, to use 
her own words ; but she allowed herself to be overpersuaded.

I am so ill. Mrs. Ben Taylor said to Doctor Trezevant, Surely, she is too ill to be going about ; she ought to be in 
bed. il She is very feeble, very nervous, as you say, but 
then she is living on nervous excitement. If you shut her up she would die at once. A queer weakness of the heart, 
I have. Sometimes it beats so feebly I am sure it has stopped altogether. Then they say I have fainted, but I 
never lose consciousness.

Mrs. Preston and I were talking of negroes and cows. A negro, no matter how sensible he is on any other subject, 
can never be convinced that there is any necessity to feed a cow. Turn em out, and let em grass. Grass good nuff for cow."

Famous news comes from Richmond, but not so good from the coast. Mrs. Izard said, quoting I forget whom: 
" If West Point could give brains as well as training! " Smith is under arrest for disobedience of orders Pemberton's orders. This is the third general whom Pemberton has displaced within a few weeks Ripley, Mercer, and now Smith.

When I told my husband that Molly was full of airs since her late trip home, he made answer : Tell her to go 
to the devil she or anybody else on the plantation who is dissatisfied; let them go. It is bother enough to feed and 
clothe them now." When he went over to the plantation 
he returned charmed with their loyalty to him, their affection and their faithfulness.

Sixteen more Yankee regiments have landed on James Island. Eason writes, " They have twice the energy and 
enterprise of our people." I answered, " Wait a while. Let them alone until climate and mosquitoes and sand-flies 
and dealing with negroes takes it all out of them. Stone wall is a regular brick, going all the time, winning his 
way wherever he goes. <a href='/results.php?tla=wfp' rel='acquaintance met'>Governor Pickens</a> called to see me. His wife is in great trouble, anxiety, uncertainty. Her 
brother and her brother-in-law are either killed or taken prisoners.

Tom Taylor says Wade Hampton did not leave the field on account of his wound. " What heroism! " said some 
one. No, what luck! He is the luckiest man alive. He ll never be killed. He was shot in the temple, but that did 
not kill him. His soldiers believe in his luck.

<a href='/results.php?tla=wfs' rel=''>General Scott</a>, on Southern soldiers, says, we have elan, courage, woodcraft, consummate horsemanship, endurance 
of pain equal to the Indians, but that we will not submit to discipline. "We will not take care of things, or husband our 
resources. Where we are there is waste and destruction. If it could all be done by one wild, desperate dash, we would 
do it. But he does not think we can stand the long, blank months between the acts the waiting! We can bear pain 
without a murmur, but we will not submit to be bored, etc. 
</p><p>
Now, for the other side. Men of the North can wait; they can bear discipline; they can endure forever. Losses 
in battle are nothing to them. Their resources in men and materials of war are inexhaustible, and if they see fit they 
will fight to the bitter end. Here is a nice prospect for us as comfortable as the old man's croak at Mulberry, "Bad 
times, worse coming."

Mrs. McCord says, " In the hospital the better born, that is, those born in the purple, the gentry, those who are 
accustomed to a life of luxury, are the better patients. They endure in silence. They are hardier, stronger, 
tougher, less liable to break down than the sons of the soil." 
" Why is that? " I asked, and she answered, " Something 
in man that is more than the body." 
</p><p>
I know how it feels to die. I have felt it again and again. For instance, some one calls out, Albert Sidney Johnston 
is killed." My heart stands still. I feel no more. I am, for so many seconds, so many minutes, I know not how 
long, utterly without sensation of any kind dead ; and then, there is that great throb, that keen agony of physical 
pain, and the works are wound up again. The ticking of the clock begins, and I take up the burden of life once 
more. Some day it will stop too long, or my feeble heart will be too worn out to make that awakening jar, and 
all will be over. I do not think when the end comes that there will be any difference, except the miracle of the new 
wind-up throb. And now good news is just as exciting as bad. *'t Hurrah, Stonewall has saved us ! ! The pleasure 
is almost pain because of my way of feeling it.

Miriam's Luryea and the coincidences of his life. He was born Moses, and is the hero of the bombshell. His 
mother was at a hotel in Charleston when kind-hearted Anna De Leon Moses went for her sister-in-law, and gave 
up her own chamber, that the child might be born in the comfort and privacy of a home. Only our people are 
given to such excessive hospitality. So little Luryea was born in Anna De Leon's chamber. After Chickahominy 
when he, now a man, lay mortally wounded, Anna Moses, who was living in Richmond, found him, and she brought 
him home, though her house was crowded to the door-steps. She gave up her chamber to him, and so, as he had been 
born in her room, in her room he died.
