<p>
TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, November 2d, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR : 
</p><p>
I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> on the twenty-eighth ultimo, and arrived here on the 31st, at night.
</p><p>
In the course of the present week I expect to have my audience of the States. The Stadtholder is at Nimeguen, or with the army. 
</p><p>
The outward aspect of this country is not that of a nation 
invaded by a powerful and victorious army. From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=helvoetsluys" rel="city">Helvoetsluys</a> to this place, a distance of about twenty of our 
miles, everything wears the appearance of peace and tranquility. 
</p><p>
At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> everything is also quiet. Mr. Van Staphorst and five others of the deputation from the subscribers 
of the petition against the inundations, etc., have escaped 
and fled. Mr. Visscher and four or five more are imprisoned 
on the same account. Three or five thousand troops have 
been introduced into the city, as a check upon the dispositions of the people, and for the present the government 
there meets with no resistance or opposition. 
</p><p>
But in the meantime the French armies continue to ad 
vance, and the allied armies to retreat. The Duke of York 
after his defeat on the 19th [October] abandoned Nimeguen, 
and retired to Arnheim across the Waal and the Rhine. 
Since then, however, the French have been repulsed with 
considerable loss in an attack before Nimeguen. It is 
confidently asserted that the Duke of Brunswick is immediately expected to take the command of the allied armies and the Duke of York is to serve under him. 
</p><p>
As to Maestricht there is a report that it has capitulated, 
and another that the French have also been defeated there. Venlo has certainly capitulated. The human force which 
the allies can at this time oppose against the progress of the French troops is not competent to answer the end, but the 
season is now far advanced, it becomes very rainy and unhealthy, so that possibly the armies of both parties will be obliged to go into winter quarters. 
</p><p>
The probability that the French will penetrate to Amster 
dam this season is, I think, not quite so great as it appeared 
to be three weeks since. And if there should be a respite 
of two or three months from the war, the interval will 
doubtless be very busily employed in negotiation. 
</p><p>
Mr. Fagel is gone to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> from hence upon a mission, 
the purpose of which is said to be to demonstrate to the 
British Ministry the absolute necessity of negotiating a 
peace, and to give them notice that unless they will join in it, 
the Hollanders must attempt it separately. 
</p><p>
On the other hand Lord Spencer and Mr. Grenville have 
returned from Vienna, having as is said totally failed in the 
object of their mission, which was to prevail upon the Emperor to continue the war with vigor for the recovery of his 
own dominions, and to offer him a subsidy of five millions 
sterling for the purpose. I suppose all this to be conjectural, 
for the object of those negotiations in both instances is not public. 
</p><p>
What will not admit of any doubt is, that the allies, as 
is usual among partners that play a losing game, are dissatisfied with one another ; nor is there any present appearance 
that their armies will cooperate with any sort of cordiality the ensuing season in case the war should continue. 
</p><p>
Five of the Provinces here have declared for negotiating 
a peace separately, the other two no doubt will follow. But 
what kind of peace can they expect to obtain from France 
under the present circumstances? 
</p><p>
The Patriotic party have no centre of union ; they dare 
have but little communication together, and I apprehend 
there is no plan for their operations concerted by any considerable number of them. 
</p><p>
From the few observations I have been able to make 
hitherto I imagine they have no desire of peace at present. 
Their animosity against the Stadtholder and the Regencies l 
is so great, that they would rather submit to the French as 
conquerors, than make peace with them as friends by the 
means of their present government. The inveteracy of the 
parties against each other is even greater than I expected, 
and if a revolution of the ruling power should take place, 
it is to be feared that humanity will suffer severely under 
the operation. 
</p><p>
The expectation of the Patriots is, that if the French 
should succeed, their private property will be respected. 
Many of them suppose no doubt that a discrimination will 
be made between them and the adverse party, and as France 
declared war only against the Stadtholder and his adherents, 
the nation will fraternize with all those who were before that 
time and have continued to be their implacable enemies. 
</p><p>
Private property has, indeed, hitherto been left untouched 
by the French in the places which they have conquered, and 
the only complaint of the people who have submitted to them 
has been the compulsive circulation of assignats in payment 
for whatever they purchase. Should this system be pursued, and the conquest of this country be completed, a 
total revolution of the government and even of the Constitution here seems to be inevitable. But whether the 
Provinces will be annexed to the French Republic or left 
to form a new government for themselves, to be in alliance 
with France, no person here appears to have formed an 
opinion whereupon to found a rational expectation. 
</p><p>
As this event might place me in a very embarrassing situation, I am anxiously desirous of receiving eventual instructions to regulate my conduct in either of the cases which have 
got so far within the limits of probability. 
</p><p>
Should this country become a dependence of the French 
Republic, my mission will of course be terminated by the 
extinction of the nation itself to which I am sent. Should 
it continue an independent Republic, but under a different 
form of government and constitution from that to which 
I am accredited, my functions authorized by the credentials 
and instructions which I now bear would, of course, be suspended. It is impossible to anticipate what species of authority may rise, instead of that which has hitherto governed 
this people. But it will be a great relief to my own mind, 
and possibly may be of service to the public, if I can be pre 
pared for either of those events I have mentioned, by know 
ing whether it is the pleasure of the President, that I should 
consider them as a termination of my Commission, and 
implying a permission to me to return home, or that I should remain here and wait for his express orders, subsequent to his knowledge of these occurrences. 
</p><p>
I have not yet received an answer from our bankers 
to the letter which I wrote them from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> and am there 
fore still ignorant of the fate of the loan for 800,000 dollars 
for which they were commissioned. I shall write them again 
immediately, and as soon as I have obtained my admission 
here intend going to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> myself. In the meantime, 
I remain etc. 
</p><p>
