SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours of the (no date) I received the last evening. I did not know by whose orders the restrictions on trade at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> had been 
adopted; but, it appearing to me to be founded on erroneous principles, 
induced me to give the order I did. As to the Charlestown militia, I 
have given orders so repeatedly about them, that it is needless to reiterate 
them. Except a very few, all these men are resident either in Gen. Marion's or Gen. Barnwell's brigade; and the latter being now under 
the command of Gen. Marion, he has sufficient power over them to do 
what you have requested of me. Gen. Marion has orders for the 
ammunition for your post, which, I suppose, he will deliver to you. I 
will attend to the agreement about the shot as soon as I get your account 
of it. I have directed Heriot and Tucker to apply to you for a party 
of men to take charge of some negroes to be brought from Mr. Smith's 
plantation on Santee. You will, therefore, be pleased to furnish them 
accordingly, on their application to you; and, also, have the negroes 
secured in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> until the day of sale. 
</p><p>
I am, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
