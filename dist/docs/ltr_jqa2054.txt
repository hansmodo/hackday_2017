No. 20 [EDMUND RANDOLPH]

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, January 19th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
In compliance with the request of the American bankers 
I came yesterday to this place, and arrived just at the moment when symptoms began to appear of a popular fermentation, which still continues, and of which it is impossible 
to foresee the result.
</p><p>
On Saturday the 11th the French troops entered and took 
possession of Utrecht by virtue of a capitulation. The 
usual government is preserved, and the prisons were pre 
vented from being thrown open. 
</p><p>
Yesterday morning a flag arrived here with a letter from 
General Daendels to General Golofkin, the commander of 
the garrison in this city, commanding him and the garrison 
to lay down their arms, and evacuate the place. It is to be 
observed, by way of explanation to this order, that the garrison consists altogether of troops who have already been 
made prisoners of war by the French, and have stipulated not to serve against them during the war. 
</p><p>
At about noon a deputation from the former citizen militia, who were disarmed at the period of the Revolution in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>, made application to the magistrates of the city, demanding 
the restoration of their arms, promising, if they were satisfied in this demand, to maintain the tranquility of the city. 
</p><p>
At about four in the afternoon an officer from the French army named Krayenhoff came with a flag and exhibited 
a commission constituting him commander of the city. 
He is himself a Batavian and went from this city a short 
time since. A criminal prosecution was commenced against 
him, and tomorrow is the day upon which he was to appear 
before the Court of Schepens. 
</p><p>
His demand of the magistrates was the abdication of their 
authority, but, as I am not yet authentically informed of 
the particulars, I shall wait for more certainty to communicate them. 
</p><p>
At the edge of the evening the three-colored cockades 
began to appear in the streets. The night was noisy. The 
song of the Carmagnole and the Marseillaise hymn resounded 
in the streets, but no violence was attempted. 
</p><p>
8 o clock P.M. The day has passed without any sinister 
accident. At about 10 this morning the three-colored flag 
was displayed upon the State house. A provisional municipality appointed by the Batavian Revolutionary Committee have entered upon the exercise of their functions. 
They sent a deputation to the Regency, thanking them for 
their former services, and informing them that there was no 
further occasion for them in future. In the afternoon they 
liberated from prison Mr. Visscher and the other persons 
confined for affairs of state. The tree of liberty was erected 
before the State House. The national cockade has become 
almost universal. The orange colored one however is still 
worn by the former garrison, who appear to be continued 
upon guard and patrole as usual. The Revolution was 
operated with not more than twenty-five or thirty French 
hussars within the city. It is not even certain whether a 
larger body has yet been introduced. 
</p><p>
January 2Oth. This afternoon General Pichegru with a 
body of troops amounting to two or three thousand men 
arrived in the city. The Regency of Haerlem has also been 
dismissed, and the French forces arc also in possession. 
They are likewise at Dort, and a few days more will give 
them complete and undisputed possession of the Province 
of Holland. I have, etc.
