Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had this afternoon the pleasure of receiving your favour 
of the 18th inst. Mrs. Jay joins me in sincerely congratulating you and your amiable family on your arrival in this 
country ; may your expectations of happiness in it be fully 
realized. 
</p><p>
The reasons which have determined you to settle on the 
Kennebeck, I can easily conceive are cogent, but I natter 
myself you will sometimes find leisure for excursions this 
way. 
</p><p>
I presume that our political sentiments do not differ 
essentially. To me it appears important that the American 
government be preserved as it is, until mature experience 
shall very plainly point out very useful amendments to our 
constitution ; that we steadily repel all foreign influence and 
interference, and with good faith and liberality treat all 
nations as friends in peace, and as enemies in war ; neither 
meddling with their affairs, nor permitting them to meddle 
with ours. These are the primary objects of my policy. 
The secondary ones are more numerous, such as, to be 
always prepared for war, to cultivate peace, to promote 
religion, industry, tranquillity, and useful knowledge, and to 
secure to all the quiet enjoyment of their rights, by wise 
and equal laws irresistibly executed. I do not expect that 
mankind will, before the millennium, be what they ought to 
be ; and therefore, in my opinion, every political theory 
which does not regard them as being what they arc, will 
probably prove delusive. 
</p><p>
It will give me pleasure to receive the publication you 
mention; being from your pen, it will, I am persuaded, be 
interesting. Be pleased to present our best compliments 
to Mrs. Vaughan and your sister. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your affectionate and humble servant, 
</p><p>
