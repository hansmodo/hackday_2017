DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The night before last I arrived at this place, and shall this 
day proceed down towards the Plains. Yesterday, General Parsons and myself were down at Eastchester, and within three miles of King's Bridge. From every appearance, the enemy seem 
much frightened. They have called in all their out guards, and 
collected their main force at the Bridge. 
</p><p>
Deserters come in very fast ; and, from every account I am 
able to procure, their strength at the Bridge is about two thousand five hundred. Inclosed you have a late paper, which, in 
my opinion, paints their distress in many particulars. When opportunity will permit, I shall be glad to see you down here. My 
compliments to your brother; and I am, dear Sir, 
Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
