Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 21st of January was delivered to me 
this morning. It is painful to say disagreeable things to 
any person, and especially to those with whom one has lived 
in habits of friendship ; but candour on this subject forbids 
reserve. You was of the number of those who possessed 
my esteem, and to whom I was attached. To me, personally, you have never given offence ; but, on the contrary, I 
am persuaded you sincerely wished me well, and was disposed to do me good offices. 
</p><p>
The card you left for me at <a href='/results.php?tla=wib' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Bingham</a>'s, and also the 
letter you mention, were both delivered to me ; and I cannot express the regret I experienced from the cruel necessity 
I thought myself under, of passing them over in silence ; 
but I love my country and my honour better than my friends, 
and even my family, and am ready to part with them all 
whenever it would be improper to retain them. You are 
either exceedingly injured, or you are no friend to America ; 
and while doubts remain on that point, all connexion 
between us must be suspended. I wished to hear what 
you might have to say on that head, and should have named 
a time and place for an interview, had not an insurmountable 
obstacle intervened to prevent it. I was told by more than 
one, on whose information I thought I could rely, that you 
received visits from, and was on terms of familiarity with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>. Every American who gives his hand to 
that man, in my opinion, pollutes it. 
</p><p>
I think it my duty to deal thus candidly with you, and I 
assure you, with equal sincerity, that it would give me cordial satisfaction to find you able to acquit yourself in the 
judgment of the dispassionate and impartial. If it is in 
your power to do it, I think you do yourself injustice by 
not undertaking that necessary task. That you may perform it successfully, whenever you undertake it, is the 
sincere wish and desire of, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
