Not more than half a dozen persons called today, and they were on business. It being Christmas day, the family attended church. I remained in my office, attended to some of the business, on my table, and wrote a rough draft of a message which I have made up my mind to send to Congress recommending the appointment of a, Lieutenant-General of the army, who shall be commander in chief during the war with Mexico; and also recommending prompt action upon the recommendations of the Secretary of War in his annual report.
