MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE public prints announce the death of my old, 
esteemed friend General Roberdeau, whose virtues in 
heart-searching times endeared him to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
and to his country. His friendly attention to me 
when Congress held their sessions at <a href='/results.php?city=yorktown' rel='city'>Yorktown</a>, I can 
never forget, and it excites a more lively interest in 
his loss than that of some others who have lately 
gone before him.

Mr. King is re-elected by the legislature of New 
York, by a majority of five in the house and two in 
the senate, in opposition to Mr. Tillotson, whom you 
know to have married a sister of Chancellor Livings 
ton. This is a great point gained. <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, Chancellor Livingston, <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Burr</a>, Mr. Yates, and <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hamilton</a>, are mentioned as successors to <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>Governor Clinton</a>, who has resigned, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, if he should not 
return, will not run very fast. <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hamilton</a>, it is 
said, will not serve. Chancellor will stand no chance, 
as I hear, and it is doubted whether Burr or Yates 
will prevail. We are still at uncertainties whether 
<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, or despatches from him, will arrive before 
the fourth of March, which makes me still dubious 
whether it will be right for me to go away. I am 
most earnestly and ardently desirous of it, but will it do? 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington is very happy at present in a visit 
from her two granddaughters, N.'s sisters, as I suppose 
they are. One of them is a fine, blooming, rosy girl, 
who, I dare say, has had more liberty and exercise 
than Nelly. I dined yesterday at <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a>'s, whose 
hospitality is always precious. A company of venerable old rakes of us, threescore years of age, or 
a little over or a little under, sat smoking cigars, 
drinking Burgundy and Madeira, and talking politics 
till almost eleven o clock. This will do once in a great 
while, not often for me. 
</p><p>
In Senate, we have no feelings this session. All is 
cool. No passions, no animation in debate. I never 
sat in any public assembly so serenely. What storm 
may be preparing I know not. A great calm at sea, 
or an uncommonly fine day at land, is called a 
weather-breeder. But if Jay's despatches don t arrive, we shall have no tempestuous weather this session. I wish you a pleasant thanksgiving, though I 
fear I shall not be with you according to my wishes. 
</p><p>
Adieu.

Instead of an additional snow and a return of cold, 
as I hoped this morning, we have now a warm and plentiful rain, which is melting the snow and 
spoiling the sleighing. I hope you have more snow, 
more steady cold, and good sledding. The post to 
day brought me no letter. I don t always very sanguinely look for a letter on Thursday. I should be 
inconsolable on a disappointment, on Monday.
