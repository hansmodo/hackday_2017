Sir,
</p><p>
I have received this moment a letter, of which I have the honor to
enclose your Excellency a copy. It is on the case of Asquith and others,
citizens of the United States, in whose behalf I had taken the liberty
of asking your interference. I understand by this letter, that they have
been condemned to lose their vessel and cargo, and to pay six thousand
livres and the costs of the prosecution before the 25th instant, or
to go to the galleys. This payment being palpably impossible to men
in their situation, and the execution of the judgment pressing, I am
obliged to trouble your Excellency again, by praying, if the government
can admit any mitigation of their sentence, it may be extended to them
in time to save their persons from its effect.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with very great respect, your Excellency's most
obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
