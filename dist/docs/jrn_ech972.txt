Several of the passengers have been attacked again with seasickness; among the number, friend Atkins and myself. I undertook to make some soup out of essence of beef, but not being able to obtain boiling water was not very successful. Atkins ate some of it notwithstanding. He is rapidly recovering and ate a hearty dinner tonight of codfish and potatoes. As I am still unable to eat, I have consulted the doctor. Many others are still on the sick list. Our first steward has been so bad that little hope was entertained for his recovery, but I am now happy to say that under the treatment of Dr. Harris, he is slowly recruiting. We have found the weather quite warm enough without our coats, in this respect much pleasanter than on shore.

We had made about 1,200 miles southeast of Philadelphia in a strong, fair wind, and hoped soon to change our course to a more southern direction, but quite a calm followed and the water continued as smooth as a
mirror. There was not enough wind to fill a sail. The current carried us 20 or 30 miles back until we were again opposite Chesapeake Bay, at what distance I know not. The Mother Carey's have all left us. I saw a plank covered with innumerable little white shellfish. I suppose it must have been floating in the ocean a long time.

We have seen thousands of dolphins, but up to this time have been able to catch only two. One was harpooned by a sailor, the other caught with a hook and line. The largest was rather larger than a fine shad. They are without scales and are said to be very good eating. An effort was made to harpoon some porpoises, but without success. We saw hundreds of them, also five grampuses, or young whales, somewhat heavier than a horse.

The water of the ocean appears of a dark blue. When taken up in a basin it is as clear as can be, but very salty and cannot be used for cooking purposes. It would be amusing to some of our old washer-women to witness us washing our clothes and putting them out to dry. I used to deem it play, but recent experience in washing, in salt water and without soap, has taught me to appreciate the feelings for which the ladies are proverbial on a washing day. I made my début in washing clothes while on the Delaware River. This morning I made my second effort since leaving Philadelphia, and I have just examined my clothes and find them not quite clean. I expect to be an expert hand at the business by the time I reach San Francisco. Many did their washing today and are now taking in their clothes.

Many of the passengers who are expert swimmers enjoyed themselves by bathing in the open ocean. A canvas was put out, giving those who could not swim an opportunity to bathe. Mr. Holland, the President
of our Association, caught three speckled fish in a basket hung out at the stern of the vessel. Others of the passengers have been amusing themselves fishing, but without catching any fish. The majority are engaged in reading or writing and not a few in gaming (gaming, not gambling). A few make merry over the flowing bowl. I have as yet hardly fixed myself, but I commenced my Bible at the first chapter of Exodus, having read to this point before leaving port. All hands are in good spirits but the calm was rather annoying to many who are overanxious to reach the point of their destination. I find it very dull and tiresome to pass the time on board and would much sooner be at some manual occupation.

This afternoon a slight wind sprung up and we are now moving along quietly. In the distance there are two vessels. Perhaps we may speak one of them.
