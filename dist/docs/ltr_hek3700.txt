Sir, 
</p><p>
There being no established principles to govern the 
appointments to the vacancies of officers in the artillery, some doubts have arisen since the last regulation of the army, whether the right of appointment 
is in Congress, as generally has been the case, or in 
the States in which the regiments of artillery are apportioned, as part of their quotas. This uncertainty 
has operated to the prejudice of the service, by keeping vacant many second Lieutenantcies, which are 
highly necessary to be filled, as there is a great deficiency of officers of that rank. 
</p><p>
The regiments of artillery having different origins, 
the appointments, of course, have been derived from 
different authorities. Colonels Lamb's and Crane's 
regiments were raised, and the officers appointed, by 
virtue of powers given your Excellency in December, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. Colonel Harrison's regiment was raised and 
appointed by the State of Virginia, under the authority of Congress. Colonel Proctor's was originally 
raised by Pennsylvania, as a State regiment, and afterwards taken upon the Continental establishment 
by a resolve of Congress. The new appointments, 
which have taken place since the first formation of 
the regiments, have been made by Congress, in consequence of the request and certificates of the officers 
commanding regiments, countersigned by the General Officer commanding the corps. 
</p><p>
The promotions have been regimental to, and including, the rank of Captains, and to Field-Officers in 
the line of the corps at large. It is this principle 
which connects the regiments of artillery, and forms 
them into one corps, and which, if taken away, will 
reduce it to so many distinct regiments, independent 
of each other, without cement or any other quality 
which will enhance its utility and reputation. If the 
States interfere in the appointments, it is apparent 
the connection between the different regiments will 
be destroyed ; for the same power, which has a right 
to appoint, will claim a right to promote in case of 
vacancies; one is the consequence of the other. The 
distinction between the right of appointment and promotion, is too nice to be observed, or rather cannot 
be made. 
</p><p>
We have the experience of our own service, in addition to that of others, that rank is esteemed an 
unalienable right, and the acquisition of it the highest reward of military virtue. The principles of promotion, therefore, ought to be fixed and certain, and 
so clear as not to be liable to be misunderstood. 
The artillery, being composed of troops from different States, no one State can have the direction of 
the promotion of the whole, or even a part ; as a 
single promotion must affect the whole line. Congress only, with propriety, can make the appointments and promotions. 
</p><p>
The qualifications requisite for an officer of artillery being materially different from those for an officer of infantry, great care ought to be taken that 
none are appointed but such as possess a proper 
proportion of knowledge of the mathematics, and 
other necessary abilities for the nature of the service. 
It is from the talents of the officers of artillery, improved by experience, that America may expect to 
derive an essential part of her military character. 
That the greatest caution should be observed in 
making the appointments, I would humbly propose that they should originate with the Colonels of the 
regiments, who shall certify that the person recommended appears possessed of a proper proportion of 
mathematical knowledge, and such other qualifications 
as to make a good officer of artillery, and that this 
certificate should be countersigned by the General Officer commanding the corps, and by him transmitted to Congress ; that the promotions should be regimental to Captains, and to Field-Officers in the line 
of the corps at large ; and that the principles of the 
appointments and promotions be expressed in the most 
explicit terms. 
</p><p>
I am persuaded, that unless the Honorable Congress immediately establishes a system for the appointments and promotion of artillery, the corps will 
soon be involved in the utmost confusion. The best 
of the officers, seeing the uncertainty of promotion, 
will be disgusted, and leave the service ; and the present state of the artillery, which has been the work 
of years, may be ruined in an hour, by the premature promotion of an individual State. If your Excellency should view this matter in the same point 
of light, I beg you would be pleased to make such 
a representation to Congress, as may prevent the 
evils apprehended. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect 
and esteem, &c., 
</p><p>
