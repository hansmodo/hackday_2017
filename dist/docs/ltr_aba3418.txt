MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I seldom feel a sufficient stimulus for writing until I 
hear that a vessel is just about to sail, and then I 
find myself so deep in debt, that I know not where 
to begin to discharge the account ; but it is time for 
me to be a little more provident ; for, upon looking 
into my list, I rind I have no less than eighteen correspondents, who have demands upon me. One 
needs to have a more fruitful fund than I am possessed of, to pay half these in sterling bullion. I fear 
many will find too great a quantity of alloy to be 
pleased with the traffic. 
</p><p>
I think, in one of my letters to you last autumn, 
I promised to give you some account of the celebrated actress, Mrs. Siddons, whom I was then 
going to see. You may well suppose my expectations were very high ; but her circumstances were 
such then as prevented her from exerting that force 
of passion, and that energy of action, which have rendered her so justly celebrated You will 
suppose that she ought not to have appeared at all 
upon the stage. I should have thought so too, if I 
had not seen her ; but she had contrived her dress 
in such a manner as wholly to disguise her situation ; and chose only those tragedies where little 
exertion was necessary. The first piece I saw her 
in was Shakspeare's " Othello." She was interestins; beyond anv actress I had ever seen : but I lost 
much of the pleasure of the play, from the sooty 
appearance of the Moor. Perhaps it may be early 
prejudice ; but I could not separate the African color 
from the man, nor prevent that disgust and horror 
which rilled my mind every time I saw him touch 
the gentle Desdemona ; nor did I wonder that Brabantio thought some love potion or some witchcraft 
had been practised to make his daughter fall in love 
with what she scarcely dared to look upon. 
</p><p>
I have been more pleased with her since in several other characters, particularly in Matilda in " The 
Carmelite," a play which I send you for your amusement. Much of Shakspeare's language is so uncouth that it sounds very harsh. He has beauties 
which are not equalled ; but I should suppose they 
might be rendered much more agreeable for the 
stage bv alterations. I saw Mrs. Siddons a few 
evenings ago in " Macbeth," a play, you recollect, 
full of horror. She supported her part with great 
propriety ; but she is too great to be put in so detestable a character. I have not yet seen her in her 
most pathetic characters, which are Jane Shore, 
Belvidera in " Venice Preserved," and Isabella in 
"The Fatal Marriage." For you must make as 
much interest here to get a box when she plays, as 
to get a place at Court ; and they are usually obtained in the same way. It would be very difficult 
to find the thing in this country which money will 
not purchase, provided you can bribe high enough. 
</p><p>
What adds much to the merit of Mrs. Siddons, is 
her virtuous character ; slander itself never having 
slurred it. She is married to a man who bears a 
good character ; but his name and importance are 
wholly swallowed up in her fame. She is the mother 
of five children ; but from her looks you would not 
imagine her more than twenty-five years old. She 
is happy in having a brother w T ho is one of the best 
tragic actors upon the stage, and always plays the 
capital parts with her ; so that both her husband 
and the virtuous part of the audience can see them 
in the tenderest scenes without once fearing for 
their reputation. I scribble to you upon' these subjects, yet fear they do not give you the pleasure I 
wish to communicate ; for it is with the stage as 
with Yorick's " Sentimental Journey," no person 
can have an equal relish for it with those who have 
been in the very place described. 
</p><p>
I can, however, inform you of something which 
will be more interesting to you, because it is the 
work of one of our own countrymen, and of one of 
the most important events of the late war. Mr. 
Trumbull has made a painting of the battle at 
Charlestown, and the death of General Warren. To 
speak of its merit, I can only say that in looking at 
it my whole frame contracted, my blood shivered, 
and I felt a faintness at my heart. He is the first 
painter who has undertaken to immortalize by his 
pencil those great actions, that gave birth to our 
nation. By this means he will not only secure his 
own fame, but transmit to posterity characters and 
actions which will command the admiration of future 
ages, and prevent the period which gave birth to 
them from ever passing away into the dark abyss of 
time. At the same time, he teaches mankind that it 
is not rank nor titles, but character alone, which interests posterity. Yet, notwithstanding the pencil 
of a Trumbull and the historic pen of a Gordon and 
others, many of the component parts of the great 
whole will finally be lost. Instances of patience, 
perseverance, fortitude, magnanimity, courage, humanity, and tenderness, which would have graced 
the Roman character, are known only to those who 
were themselves the actors, and whose modesty will 
not suffer them to blazon abroad their own fame. 
These, however, will be engraven by Yorick's recording angel upon unfading tablets, in that repository, where a just estimate will be made both of 
principles and actions. 
</p><p>
Your letters of September and January I have 
received with much pleasure, and am happy to find 
that the partiality of a parent with regard to a very 
dear son, had not lessened him in the eyes of his 
friends ; for praises are often so many inquisitors, 
and always a tax where they are lavished. I think I may with justice say, that a due sense of moral 
obligation, integrity, and honor, are the predominant 
traits of his character ; and these are good foundations, upon which one may reasonably build hopes of 
future usefulness. The longer I live in the world, 
and the more I see of mankind, the more deeply I 
am impressed with the importance and necessity of 
good principles and virtuous examples being placed 
before youth, in the most amiable and engaging manner, whilst the mind is uncontaminated, and open to 
impressions. Yet precept without example is of little 
avail, for habits of the mind are produced by the exertion of inward practical principles. The "soul's 
calm sunshine " can result only from the practice of 
virtue, which is congenial to our natures. If happiness is not the immediate consequence of virtue, as 
some devotees to pleasure affirm, yet they will find 
that virtue is the indispensable condition of happiness ; 
and, as the poet expresses it, 
</p><p>
" Peace, Virtue ! peace is all thy own." 
</p><p>
But I will quit this subject, lest my good brother 
should think I have invaded his province, and subscribe myself 
</p><p>
Your sister, 
</p><p>
A. A.
