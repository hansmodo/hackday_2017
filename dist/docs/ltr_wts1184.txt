<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, D.C., Jan. 31, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1868">1868</a>. 
</p><p>
To THE PRESIDENT: 
</p><p>
Since our interview of yesterday I have given the 
subject of our conversation all my thoughts, and I beg 
you will pardon my reducing the result to writing. 
</p><p>
My personal preferences, if expressed, were to be 
allowed to return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> to resume my present 
command; because my command was important, large, 
suited to my rank and inclination, and because my 
family was well provided for there, in house facilities, 
schools, living, and agreeable society. 
</p><p>
Whilst, on the other hand, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> was for many 
(to me) good reasons highly objectionable. Especially 
because it is the political capital of the country and focus 
of intrigue, gossip, and slander. Your personal preferences were, as expressed, to make a new department East 
adequate to my rank, with headquarters at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, 
and to assign me to its command to remove my family 
here, and to avail myself of its schools, etc. ; to remove 
Mr. Stanton from his office as Secretary of War, and 
have me to discharge the duties. 
</p><p>
To effect this removal two modes were indicated: to 
simply cause him to quit the War Office building and 
notify the Treasury Department and the Army Staff 
Departments no longer to respect him as Secretary of 
War; or to remove him, and submit my name to the 
Senate for confirmation. Permit me to discuss these 
points a little, and I will premise by saying that I have 
spoken to no one on the subject, and have not even seen 
Mr. Ewing, Mr. Stanberry, or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> since I was 
with you. 
</p><p>
It has been the rule and custom of our army since the 
organization of the Government that the second officer 
of the army should be at the second (in importance) command, and remote from general headquarters. To bring 
me to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> would put three heads to an army, 
yourself, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a>, and myself, and we would be 
more than human if we were not to differ. In my judgment it would ruin the army, and would be fatal to one 
or two of us. 
</p><p>
Generals Scott and Taylor proved themselves soldiers 
and patriots in the field, but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> was fatal to 
both. This city and the influences that centred here 
defeated every army that had its head here from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1861">1861</a> 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>, and would have overwhelmed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> at 
Spottsylvania and Petersburg had he not been fortified 
by a strong reputation already hard earned, and because 
no one then living coveted the place. Whereas in the 
West we made progress from the start, because there was 
no political capital near enough to poison our minds and 
kindle into light that craving itching for fame which has 
killed more good men than bullets. I have been with 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> in the midst of death and slaughter 
when the howls of people reached him after Shiloh; 
when messengers were speeding to and fro between his 
army and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, bearing slanders to induce his removal before he took <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>; in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chattanooga" rel="city">Chattanooga</a>, when 
the soldiers were stealing the corn of the starving mules 
to satisfy their own hunger; at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, when he was 
ordered to the " forlorn hope " to command the army of 
the Potomac, so often defeated and yet I never saw 
him more troubled than since he has been in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and been compelled to read himself a "sneak and 
deceiver," based on reports of four of the Cabinet, and 
apparently with your knowledge. If this political atmosphere can disturb the equanimity of one so guarded 
and so prudent as he is, what will be the result with one 
so careless, so outspoken as I am? Therefore, with my 
consent, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> never. 
</p><p>
As to the Secretary of War, his office is twofold. As 
Cabinet officer he should not be there without your 
hearty, cheerful consent, and I believe that is the judgment and opinion of every fair-minded man. As the 
holder of a civil office, having the supervision of monies 
appropriated by Congress, and of contracts for army 
supplies, I do think Congress, or the Senate by delegation from Congress, has a lawful right to be consulted. 
At all events, I would not risk a suit or contest on that 
phase of the question. The Law of Congress of March 
2, 18G7, prescribing the manner in which orders and instructions relating to " Military Movements " shall reach 
the army gives you, as Constitutional Commander-inChief, the very power you want to exercise, and enables 
you to prevent the Secretary from making any such 
orders and instructions, and consequently he cannot control the army, but is limited and restricted to a duty 
that an auditor of the Treasury could perform. You 
certainly can afford to await the result. The executive 
power is not weakened, but, rather, strengthened. Surely 
he is not such an obstruction as would warrant violence 
DI even a show of force which could produce the very 
reaction and clamor that he hopes for, to save him from 
the absurdity of holding an empty office " for the safety 
of the country." 
</p><p>
With great respect, 
</p><p>
Yours truly, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>.
