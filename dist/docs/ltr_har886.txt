LOS ANGELES, November 10th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>.
</p><p>
We left San Francisco on the 6th inst., and after a voyage by the coast steamer of two days and a half, entered the Bay of San Pedro, where we were transferred to a small class steamer and taken seven miles up the bay to Wilmington; thence by rail, twenty-two miles, to this ancient city. There is just now a great rush of travel to this and other towns along the coast, especially to San Diego, where the Southern Pacific Railroad, as it is expected, will make its terminus. The steamer on which we came, left port with three hundred passengers, and was overladen with freight: the sea rough, and nearly all sick; some swore and some cascaded. On the way we saw a whale spouting and frolicking within two hundred yards of the ship. He frequently showed his back above water, and in spouting, gave us a good specimen of the fountain, when playing, in
our Cleveland Park. We stopped on the way at Santa Barbara for a short time, to deliver freight and receive passengers. It is an old Spanish town, of about six thousand inhabitants, located on the plain and hill-side, close to the bay. It is noted for having produced the largest grape vine known on the American continent. This celebrated vine has a main trunk eight feet high and fifteen inches in diameter, and throws off long branches, which take root and extend like the Banyan tree, covering a large space of ground. It was planted nearly a century ago, by a Spanish lady, and bore last year six tons of grapes. On the hill-side, near the limits of the town, stands an old cathedral, an imposing structure, built by the Jesuits almost a hundred years ago. It commands a fine view of the town; and the valley lands in its vicinityare rich and highly cultivated. Americans are now settling here so rapidly that speculation in lands has created a feverish excitement, not only in this locality, but along the entire coast.
</p><p>
Los Angeles is indebted to the Jesuits for its name, which means "The City of the Angels;" but judging from the specimens I have seen here, I should say that their visits have been "few and far between," unless angels are made up of mixed bloods, and of all colors, and sadly made up at that. Take it altogether, it is a unique old town,
full of oddities and whimsicalities. Half the population is Mexican, the other half American, English, Scotch, Irish, German, and the Lord knows what; yet there is a goodly number of intelligent, refined and accomplished people, who reside here and give tone to society. The learned professions appear to be overstocked, yet each is represented by some individuals of distinguished talent. The city, with few exceptions, is built in Mexican style, and wears a dilapidated look. It contains a population, they say, of about twenty thousand. The roofs of the houses are generally flat and the walls adobe. It is situated at the base of the foot-hills, about thirty miles from the line of the sea coast, and extends into the plain for a considerable distance. It includes within its limits many fine gardens, vineyards and orange groves. It is emphatically the land of fruits and flowers, always fresh and fascinating. If not the first, it is the second edition of the true Garden of Eden.
</p><p>
The climate here is the finest in the world, never too hot and never too cold, but always equable and exhilarating. It never rains except in winter; the fruit trees, the gardens and the vineyards are ever flourishing, and commingle fruits and flowers in perennial profusion. The winter rains are nothing more than genial showers. In
fact, the winter is like our spring, when the leaves of the trees, and the buds and the flowers burst into life, and the fields become green.
</p><p>
In the vicinity there are several extensive orange and lemon groves, as well as vineyards and other fruits. The orange grove we visited contains twelve hundred and sixty trees, sixteen years old, and was ladened with fruit in every stage of growth from buds and blossoms to ripe fruit. The average annual crop from each tree, we were told, yields a profit of seventy-five dollars. We also saw a grove of the English walnut, the annual product of which, per tree, was estimated at one hundred and twenty-five dollars. In addition to these they cultivate many other kinds of fruit with equal success, if not with equal profit, such as figs, olives, dates, limes, pears, peaches, and apples. It is here that the two climes, the temperate and the tropical, seem to overlap each other, and to vie with each other in the excellence and abundance of their productions.
</p><p>
From Los Angeles, which we regarded as our base, or central point, we made an excursion into the country, and visited several of the most extensive ranches within the circuit of a hundred miles, traveling in an open carriage. A ranch is simply an old Spanish plantation, containing usually from ten thousand to one hundred and
fifty thousand acres, and sometimes more; in or near the centre of which stands an old flat-roofed house, built of adobe, which is a large square mud brick, dried in the sun, instead of being burned in a kiln. The house is generally constructed in the shape of a parallelogram, inclosing an open court, and having on the outside an open portico. It is a queer looking sort of a mansion; yet, in the olden time, it possessed all the charms of a royal palace in the estimation of the populace. It was in palatial residences of this character, that the richer classes of the Mexicans and Spaniards took their ease and lived in comparative luxury, until the war with Mexico occurred, when they were annexed to the United States.
</p><p>
After the war they attempted to adopt American habits, and to live in American style; the result was, they became extravagant, and soon so encumbered their estates that they were obliged to sell them at nominal prices. The Americans were the purchasers, and obtained the lands, in many instances, as low as ten cents an acre. Some of these large tracts, thus obtained, are now worth from five to fifty dollars an acre. They compose the best lands in California, and extend in a chain of valleys from San Diego to San Francisco, and even along the entire coast of the State. The appearance of these ranch lands in the summer
and fall months is quite unlike the green fields we see in the Eastern States. Here the grasses acquire a rank growth after the rains in winter and during the early spring, and then become perfectly dry, still standing upright where they grew, and thus remain, for seven or eight months, during the rainless season, as dry and sweet as the best of hay preserved in a barn. While in this condition, these grasses are still rich and nutrative, and afford abundant feed for the vast herds of sheep, cattle and horses, that roam at large over the plains. In a word, Nature does the haying, and leaves man with little to do, except to guard his flocks and herds, and take it easy. The old grass remains sufficient and in good condition until the new grass appears under the influence of the early winter rains; it then falls, and in its decay, serves to enrich the soil.
</p><p>
We visited several ranches, and were not only politely received and entertained, but acquired an interesting, though brief, experience of ranch life. We remained nearly a week at the ranch, known as the San Joaquin. This ranch consists of one hundred and ten thousand acres, and is stocked with forty thousand fine-wooled sheep. In extent, it is one of the largest ranches south of Los Angeles, being some twelve miles wide by twenty long. It is mostly valley land, and stretches from
the foot-hills to the sea. In some of the hills, within its boundaries, mines of coal and quicksilver have recently been discovered, which promise to become valuable. The ranch is amply watered by springs, and a chain of small lagoons, extending through it, centrally, supposed to be a subterranean river, from the connection there is in the hidden currents that pass from one lagoon to another, and the tremulous character of the soil, which seems to rest on its surface. In some places, if you thrust a pole through the turf, it disappears at once, and is never seen again.
</p><p>
These lagoons terminate in a small bay, which extends from the ocean into the ranch about two miles. On the shore of this bay I saw a camp of Mexican fishermen, who were engaged in manufacturing oil from the carcasses of sharks, which they catch in abundance along the sea coast. The Mexicans make this a profitable business. They go out to sea in small boats, and catch the sharks by harpooning or shooting them, as they rise to the surface in their eagerness to swallow the bait flung to them. When caught, they are towed into the bay, and so great is the number of their skeletons lying about the camp, that the atmosphere, throughout the entire vicinity for miles, is rendered impure and even offensive. Nothing of this kind, I believe, can offend the olfactories of a Mexican.
</p><p>
The sheep with which this ranch is stocked, are subdivided in flocks of three thousand to five thousand, and each division placed in charge of a shepherd, who watches over them, by day and by night, like the shepherds of old, but with this difference, perhaps, that he gathers the sheep into a corral or pen at night, and then betakes himself to his eight-by-ten board cabin, next the enclosure, and there cooks, eats and sleeps as best he can, with no other associates than his sheep and faithful dog. His life is truly a lonely one, and yet he seems happy in the companionship of his sheep and dog, who understand his signs and his whistle, and even the import of his words, and obey him with a child-like confidence in his superior wisdom and intelligence. The annual clip of wool from the sheep of this ranch, is said to be about two hundred thousand pounds. It is of the finest quality, and sells at a high price in the eastern market. Add to the income from the wool the annual product of twenty thousand lambs, and it is easy to see that wool-growing is a very profitable business in California.
</p><p>
In some parts of the coast range, there are numbers of very extensive dairy ranches. One ranch in Marin county, containing sixty thousand acres, is stocked with over three thousand head of milch cows. Some fifteen or twenty other ranches
keep from three hundred to a thousand head. The most productive part of the year for butter and cheese, commences in November and ends in June. After that period the grass dries up, and is converted into standing hay, under the influence of a burning sun and cloudless sky. And yet it is said that a good milch cow will produce from a hundred and fifty to a hundred and seventy-five pounds of butter, annually, or nearly twice that amount of cheese.
</p><p>
The largest cheese ever made in the world, was made on one of these dairy ranches. It was made during the late war, and weighed four thousand pounds. It was sold in San Francisco at fifty cents a pound, for the benefit of the "Sanitary Fund." The butter, as well as the cheese, is manufactured by steam power. In this business, fortunes may be made or lost in a single year. Little things cannot be done in California; it must be great things or nothing.
