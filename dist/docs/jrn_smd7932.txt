Meeting Miriam by mere accident on the road 
last evening and hearing of our surprising journey to 
Georgia, Mr. Halsey came to spend a last evening 
with us, and say good-bye. What a deluge of regrets, 
hopes, fears, etc. Perfectly overwhelming. Why had 
I not told him of it the night before? All our friends 
would be so disappointed at not having an opportunity of saying good-bye. If the Yankees would only 
postpone their attack so he might accompany us! 
But no matter; he would come on in two months, 
and meet us there. And would we not write to him? 
Thank you! Miriam may, but I shall hardly do so! 
We had such a pleasant evening together, talking 
over our trip. Then we had a dozen songs on the 
guitar, gay, sad, and sentimental; then he gave me a 
sprig of jessamine as a keepsake, and I ripped open 
my celebrated " running-bag " to get a real for true^ 
silver five cents a perfect curiosity in these days 
-which I gave him in exchange, and which he 
promised to wear on his watch-chain. He and Miriam 
amused themselves examining the contents of my 
sack and laughing at my treasures, the wretches! 
Then came good-bye. I think he was sorry to see 
us go. Well! he ought to miss us! Ah! these fare 
wells! To-day I bid adieu to <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a>. "It may be 
for years, and it may be forever!" This good-bye 
will cost me a sigh.
