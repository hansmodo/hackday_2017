MY DEAREST FRIEKD, 
</p><p>
YOUR favors of September 29 and October 21 are 
before me. I avoided saying any thing about Charles 
to save you the anxiety, which I fear you will now 
feel in its greatest severity, a long time. I thought 
he would go directly home in a short passage in the 
best opportunity which would probably ever present. 
But I am disappointed. Charles is at <a href='/results.php?city=bilboa' rel='city'>Bilboa</a> with 
Major Jackson and Colonel Trumbull, who take the 
best care of his education, as well as his health and 
behavior. They are to go hence with Captain Hill in 
a good vessel of twenty guns. Charles's health was 
so much affected by this tainted atmosphere, and he 
had set his heart so much upon going home with Gil- 
Ion, that it would have broken it to have refused him. 
I desire I may never again have the weakness to bring 
a child to Europe. They are infinitely better at home. 
We have all been sick here, myself, Mr. Thaxter, Stevens and another servant, but are all better. Mr. Thaxter's indisposition has been slight and short, mine 
and Stevens's long and severe. 
</p><p>
I beg you would not flatter yourself with hopes of 
peace. There will be no such thing for several years. 
Don t distress yourself neither about any malicious 
attempts to injure me in the estimation of my country 
men. Let them take their course and go the length 
of their tether. They will never hurt your husband, 
whose character is fortified with a shield of innocence 
and honor ten thousand fold stronger than brass or 
iron. The contemptible essays made by you know 
whom will only tend to his own confusion. My letters have shown them their own ignorance, a sight 
they could not bear. Say as little about it as I do. 
It has already brought them into the true system, and 
that system is triumphant. I laugh and will laugh 
before all posterity at their impotent rage and envy. 
They could not help blushing themselves if they were 
to review their conduct. 
</p><p>
Dear Tom, thy letter does thee much honor. Thy 
brother Charles shall teach thee French and Dutch at 
home. I wish I could get time to correspond with 
thee and thy sister more regularly, but I cannot. I 
must trust <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> and thine excellent mamma for 
the education of my children. Mr. Dana and our 
son are well at Petersburg. Hayden has some 
things for you. I hope he is arrived. I am sorry to 
learn you have a sum of paper. How could you be 
so imprudent ? You must be frugal, I assure you. 
Your children will be poorly off. I can but barely 
live in the manner that is indispensably demanded of 
me by every body. Living is dear indeed here. 
My children will not be so well left by their father as 
he was by his. They will be infected with the examples and habits and tastes for expensive living 
without the means. He was not. My children shall 
never have the smallest soil of dishonor or disgrace 
brought upon them by their father, no, not to please 
ministers, kings or nations. At the expense of a little of this, my children might perhaps ride at their 
ease through life, but dearly as I love them, they shall 
live in the service of their country, in her navy, her 
army, or even out of either in the extremest degree of 
poverty, before I will depart in the smallest iota from 
my sentiments of honor and delicacy ; for I, even I, 
have sentiments of delicacy as exquisite as the proudest minister that ever served a monarch. They may 
not be exactly like those of some ministers. 
I beg you would excuse me to my dear friends, to 
whom I cannot write so often as I wish. I have in 
dispensable duties which take up all my time, and re 
quire more than I have. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> has done me great honor and 
much public service by sending me authentic ac 
counts of his own and <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel=''>General Greene</a>'s last great 
actions. They are in the way to negotiate peace. 
It lies wholly with them. No other ministers but 
they and their colleagues in the army can accomplish 
the great event. 
</p><p>
I am keeping house, but I want a housekeeper. 
What a fine affair it would be, if we could flit across 
the Atlantic as they say the angels do, from planet to 
planet ! I would dart to Penn's hill and bring you over 
on my wings ; but, alas, we must keep house separately for some time. But one thing I am determined 
on. If God should please to restore me once more 
to your fireside, I will never again leave it without 
your ladyship's company no, not even to go to Congress at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and there I am determined to 
go, if I can make interest enough to get chosen, when 
ever I return. I would give a million sterling that 
you were here ; and I could afford it as well as Great 
Britain can the thirty millions she must spend, the 
ensuing year, to complete her own ruin. 
</p><p>
Farewell, farewell.
