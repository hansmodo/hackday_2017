Sir : <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain J. C. Fremont</a> with a party of fifty men has been within the limits of California about two months, within a few days encamped about 
eight leagues from this Town, resting his men & animals, he has two letters from the General and Prefecto, wherein he is ordered to leave this 
Country, or they will take immediate measures to compel him, they sent me copies of the same, which I have sent in English to <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a>. I 
have not heard from the camp since, this morning I wrote to <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> in duplicate, one by a Native, the other by a Foreigner, by to-morrow 
there will be collected together nearly three hundred men, with the intention to drive out the strangers, and if required, there will be by the next week, a 
much larger body collected ; should this force be used against <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a>, much blood will be shed, his party though of only fifty in number, 
have from three to six guns, rifles, and pistols each,— and very determined, both Commander & men, having every confidence in each other. It was 
the intention of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a>, to leave this week, if his animals were in good condition, perhaps he may not now be willing, as the people wish to 
force him ; he was at my house alone in February, and in company with me, visited the General, Prefecto & Alcalde, informed them of his orders to 
survey the nearest route to the Pacific, and had come into California to purchase provisions, clothes & other necessaries, including horses ; no 
objection was made at the time, since then, the General states, that he has received by the " Hannah," positive orders from Mexico, to drive <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> from the country. I shall send this letter open to Consul Parrott 
of Mazatlan, with copies of this weeks correspondence. If there is a fight between these people & <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a>, be the result for or against 
him ; the American residents are under some apprehensions of their safety hereafter. I would therefore request you, if in your power, to despatch a 
Sloop of War, to this Port, from Mazatlan, on the receipt of this. 
</p><p>
I understand there were in December, five of our Ships of War then in that Port, should this be the case, I hope it will not be inconvenient to 
comply with this request. I have looked for the Portsmouth over two months ; Captain Montgomery informed me he was to return. 
</p><p>
I remain, Sirs, your respectfull servant,

To the Commander of any American Ship of War,<br>

Monterey, May 29, 1846.

The above is a copy of the original — drawn off at the request of Captain Montgomery - <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> was not attacked - the Californians did 
not come within three leagues of his camp — he is now on his way to Oregon.
