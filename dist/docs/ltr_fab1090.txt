I have sat down to write you some news. Last night about four o'clock wind northwest commenced snowing and this morning there is at least six inches. I have actually ridden from South ferry to Union Park and back again in a sleigh! They will soon wear it out for Broadway is full of sleighs. Everybody is bound to have one ride.

We are having considerable excitement here just now. Next Monday the Grand Fancy Dress Ball at the Astor Place Opera House. Tuesday, Mr. Clay arrives. (Won't there be a crowd!) I will send you the papers containing an account of these affairs when they come off. Other affairs remain about the same.

I hear from Eliza L. that Hannah Buck is going to be married. Tell all the old maids in Bucksport there're hopes, never despair. I have nothing else to do but write letters so I am going to make you pay postage until you cry enough.
