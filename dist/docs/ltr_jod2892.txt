LAST evening, we arrived safe in this town, after the 
longest journey and through the worst roads and the 
worst weather that I have ever experienced. My horses performed extremely well.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> is a very pretty town, situated on Patapsco river, which empties itself into the great bay 
of Chesapeake. The inhabitants are all good Whigs, 
having some time ago banished all the Tories from 
among them. The streets are very dirty and miry, 
but every thing else is agreeable, except the monstrous prices of things. We cannot get a horse kept 
under a guinea a week. Our friends are well.

The continental army is filling up fast, here and 
in Virginia. I pray that the Massachusetts may not 
fail of its quota in season. In this journey we have 
crossed four mighty rivers ; Connecticut, Hudson, 
Delaware and Susquehannah. The two first, we 
crossed upon the ice, the two last, in boats ; the last, 
we crossed a little above the place where it empties 
into Chesapeake Bay.

I think I have never been better pleased with any 
of our American States than with Maryland. We 
saw most excellent farms all along the road, and what 
was more striking to me, I saw more sheep and flax 
in Maryland than I ever saw in riding a like distance 
in any other State. We scarce passed a farm with 
out seeing a fine flock of sheep, and scarce a house 
without seeing men or women dressing flax. Several 
times we saw women breaking and swingling this 
necessary article.

I have been to meeting and heard my old acquaintance, Mr. Allison, a worthy clergyman of this town, whom I have often seen in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>.
