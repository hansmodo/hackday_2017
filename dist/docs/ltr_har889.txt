It cannot be doubted that California presents more points of natural beauty and sublimity than any other part of the known world. It abounds in marvels and originalities. Among the principal points of interest to the tourist, are the Yosemite Valley, the Big Trees, and the Geysers. The first is indescribable; the second incredible; and the third infernal; and yet they all actually exist. Everybody who reads, knows as much about them as I do, and perhaps more. Owing to the lateness of the season, I did not visit them; but have heard them described so often, by friends who have visited them, that I can readily imagine how they appear, and especially so, since these masterpieces of Nature's work have many duplicates, scarcely less magnificent, which I have seen. Yet the Yosemite Valley will always be spoken of by tourists in a style of grandiloquence, which might induce
one, very properly, to question their veracity, if not their sanity.

This wonderful valley may be described as ten or twelve miles long and half a mile wide, made by splitting a mountain range through the back-bone, to the depth of five or six thousand feet; then leveling the base by filling in soil and planting it with grass, shrubs and flowers, and penciling it with silver rills and rivulets that originate in outside fountains, and come dashing over the valley's rocky rim, as if their glittering currents fell direct from Heaven, creating a mist or spray resembling a bridal veil. The valley has ever been regarded by the Indians as Nature's Sanctuary, where the Great Spirit dwells. But now you find here several hotels, filled, in summer, with visitors, who devote themselves to sight-seeing, frolic and fun, dancing, cards and billiards. These unsanctified intrusions on Nature's hallowed retreat, I should think, would incur her displeasure, if not shock her moral sense.

There are some twenty groves of the big trees, which have been discovered in different parts of California. The most noted are located in Mariposa and Calaveras counties. The largest trees are thirty-five feet in diameter, three hundred feet high, and the bark two feet thick. A hollow one that has fallen, will admit sixteen men on
horseback very comfortably. In ascending its fallen trunk you have to climb a ladder forty feet long. A few years ago a section of one of these hollow trees was shipped to London, set on end, and used as a drinking saloon. It proved a profitable investment. The distance from San Francisco to Yosemite and the big trees, is nearly one hundred and fifty miles, and to the Geysers, about sixty miles. In visiting the Geysers, your moral courage will be put to the severest test. The descent into the yawning gulf is made by a stage coach, driven by an expert, and is not only very precipitous, but hazardous. Still no serious accident has, as yet, happened. When you reach this "lower region," you find yourself in a narrow canyon, about half a mile long, surrounded by wizard nooks and angles of the wildest character, and standing on fiery billows that roll beneath your feet. Scalding jets of steam ascend at a hundred different points about you, as if leaping from a caldron boiling beneath the soil. In many places you cannot step without burning the soles of your boots. The springs of hot and cold water are so near each other, in some localities, that you can thrust one hand into hot and the other into cold water, at the same time. In many spots on the surface of the soil there is an issue of noxious gases, where sulphur deposits itself in considerable
quantities. The first discoverer of this wonderful canyon, which is, probably, a volcanic crater of ancient date, supposed, when he discovered it, that he had reached the outside door or portico of the infernal regions, and thus impressed, fled in dismay, and could never be persuaded to make a second descent.

Everywhere in the mountains of the Pacific Slope, you will see marked evidences of volcanic action. The soil is red, and the rocks appear to have been subjected to intense heat, and are sometimes vitrified. The Great Salt Lake Valley has the appearance of being the volcanic subsidence of a mountain chain--a vast crater that has been filled in with soil, abraded in the course of time from the adjoining mountains and elevated plains. The lake occupies the central portion of the original crater, and is still growing narrower by the influx of soil. On the sides of the mountains that encircle it, there remains a distinct water-mark, at an elevation of several hundred feet, showing, beyond a doubt, that this was, at some former period, the boundary line of its waters. From this fact, it is evident that the lake has subsided, or that the bordering mountains have been elevated by some sudden convulsion.

Amid the lofty mountains sloping into the State of Nevada, there sleeps a lake, called Mono,
about seventeen miles long and nine wide. It has no outlet, and is a perfect Dead Sea. No animal life can exist in it. Its waters are composed of chemical constituents, which decompose all animal substances in a short time. In other words, it is a sea of potash held in solution, of the strongest kind. The body of a man who was drowned in it, and even his clothing and boots, were almost entirely consumed in the course of a few weeks. It is a modern wonder. The seven wonders of the world, as known to the ancients, amount to nothing as compared with the almost innumerable wonders of the Pacific Slope.

In traveling among the Sierras, the scenes that surround you, look where you will, are grand, vast, and sublime. It is there that Nature sits enthroned in sublimity; eloquent in her silence; pure in her sympathies; and divine in her sway. It is there that she has lifted mountains to the skies, and sunk valleys to invisible depths. It is there that she has buried dead rivers in mountains that were once valleys, and given birth to living rivers in valleys that were once mountains. Her volcanoes, scattered here and there, are but the chimneys of her workshops. The wealth of her sublime empire is not only vast, but inexhaustible. In fact, every mountain is a bank of deposit. Whatever she does financially, she does on a specie
basis, and is ever ready to help those who are disposed to help themselves.

Throughout the Pacific Slope you will find, almost at every step, something new; something that will surprise you. It is a region entirely unlike that of the Atlantic Slope. In the Sierra Nevada range there are more than a hundred mountain peaks that pierce the heavens, rising, in some instances, to the height of fourteen or fifteen thousand feet. One of the highest is Mount Shasta, a giant, that seems to recline his head, like a child, on the bosom of God. In this mountain frame-work of California, you catch a glimpse of that great temple which was built without hands. It is here, in these cerulean halls, that Sublimity and Beauty take their social walks, and, stooping, smile on the cradled valleys that slumber at their feet. In some places you would think everything about you in a state of chaos. It looks as if great masses of matter still remained on hand after the work of creation had been finished. On entering a region of this character, my first thought was, that I had caught Nature at work in her laboratory, moulding the mountains into shape, scooping out the valleys, channeling the rivers, and planting here and there a few favorite evergreens. I really felt as if I had blundered into her presence without rapping, or giving her an opportunity to make
her toilette. But I soon discovered that Nature does not stand on ceremony, and that her native beauty is like that of an artless maiden, "when unadorned, adorned the most."

Dead rivers, as known to miners in California, are such as have been dried up and sealed up, midway, in the mountain ranges by volcanic action. Their channels are reached by tunneling into the mountain sides, and are found to contain sand beds, worn stones, and rich deposits of gold, in the form of gold dust and nuggets. It is said that more than half the gold mined in California, has been taken from these dead rivers. They lie at about the same height, and have been traced hundreds of miles.

Nearly three-fourths of the population on the Pacific coast are unmarried men, who would be very glad to ennoble their manhood, if they had the opportunity. In this connection, I might as well say as think, that if the supernumerary women of the Eastern States, who are now clamoring for their rights, would but emigrate to this golden land, they would find it not only a golden land, but would soon be able, like the Roman matron, to point to their jewels with a commendable pride, and, perhaps, realize the fact that "a curtain lecture," now and then, is vastly more effective than public lectures, in securing and preserving "woman's rights."

And now let me say, if you want to see a new world, go to California. You can go by rail from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in seven to eight days, running night and day, at the rate of about twenty-five miles an hour. After the second day out, you will not tire, if you take a sleeping car; for you then become accustomed to the change; sleep well, eat well, and enjoy a kind of home-life. The passing scenes, as you gaze from the car windows, appear like a revolving panorama, and constantly present to the eye novelties of intense interest. You can get regular meals at the stations on the way, with the exception, perhaps, of two days, while crossing the interior mountain plains. Even there, you may rely on getting at least one good "square meal" a day. At some points the water is objectionable, being too alkaline to be drinkable with safety.

By taking the lightning express train, which makes the through trip once a week each way, and has a dining car attached, you will be accommodated with every "creature comfort" you could possibly desire, and would be led to think, while on the route, that you were merely boarding at a fashionable hotel, and enjoying the best of society. Select parties, generally, prefer this train; but I should much prefer the daily express. There is some difference in the expense, but not much in
the running time. The sleeping cars attached to either train are equally elegant and palatial. In taking the daily express, you meet with well bred people, and can make, if you choose, very agreeable acquaintances. Besides, you can do as you please, eat at the stations, or resort to your own supplies. "Variety," you know, "is the spice of life."
</p><p>
If you intend to make the trip, I should advise you to take along with you a basket of lunch, a flask of brandy, and a pocket pistol. If you have a wife, take her also; if you have none, marry at once, and make it your bridal trip. A gentleman who is accompanied with his wife, is sure of being treated with consideration; but if he travels without a lady in charge, he must expect to be regarded as of little more consequence than so much freight. A word to the wise ought to be sufficient.
