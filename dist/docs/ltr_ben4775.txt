MY EVER DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of November 2Qth, with the 
parcel of seeds, for which I am greatly obliged to you. I cannot make you adequate returns in kind ; but I send you however some of the true rhubarb seed, which you desire. I had 
it from Mr. English, who lately received a medal of the 
Society of Arts for propagating it. I send also some green 
dry peas, highly esteemed here as the best for making pea 
soup ; and also some Chinese caravances, with Father Navarrete's ' account of the universal use of a cheese made of them 
in China, which so excited my curiosity, that I caused inquiry 
to be made of Mr. Flint, who lived many years there, in what 
manner the cheese was made, and I send you his answer. I 
have since learned, that some runnings of salt (I suppose 
runnet) is put into water, when the meal is in it, to turn it to 
curds. I think we have caravances' with us, but I know 
not whether they are the same with these, which actually 
came from China. They are said to be of great increase. 
</p><p>
I shall inquire of Mr. Collinson for your Journal. I see 
that of East Florida is printed with Stork's Account. 3 My 
love to good Mrs. Bartram and your children. With esteem 
I am ever, my dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
