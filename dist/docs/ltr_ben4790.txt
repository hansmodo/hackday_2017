DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I am favoured with yours of June loth. With this I send 
you our last volume of Philosophical Transactions, wherein 
you will see printed the Observations of Messrs. Biddle and 
Bayley on the Transit, as well as those of Messrs. Mason and 
Dixon relating to the longitude of places. When you and 
your friends have perused it, please to deliver it to Mrs. 
Franklin to be put among my books. 
</p><p>
Thanks for the books on the silk affair. It will give me 
great pleasure to see that business brought to perfection 
among us. The subscription is a noble one, and does great 
honour to our public spirit. If you should not procure from 
Georgia, as you expected, one that understands the reeling, 
I believe I can procure you such a hand from Italy, a great 
silk merchant here having offered me his assistance for that 
purpose, if wanted. 
</p><p>
I am happy beyond expression to see the virtue and firmness of our country, with regard to the non-importation. It 
does us great honour. And <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is in great disgrace 
with all the friends of liberty in the kingdom, who are, I assure you, no contemptible number, and who applaud the 
stand we have made, and wish us success. I am, my dear 
friend, yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
