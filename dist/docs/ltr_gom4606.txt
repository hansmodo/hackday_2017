Dear Carmichael, 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the fifth of April in London, 
but I did not choose to reply from thence, because I did not 
wish my letter to be inspected. It is true that I am appointed 
Minister Plenipotentiary here. I did not and could not announce it, because it was in the Gazettes a long time before it 
was officially known to me, and as our Senate can prevent an 
appointment, I was long in doubt whether this had really taken 
effect. It was unexpected, and must for some time to come be 
unpleasant. 
</p><p>
You know that I do, from the bottom of my heart, wish well 
to this country, and will therefore easily judge what I have felt 
in seeing them long since in the high road to despotism. They 
have made the common mistake, that, to enjoy liberty, it is necessary only to demolish authority, and the common consequence 
results, viz. that the most ardent advocates for the revolution 
begin now to wish and pray, and even cry out for the establishment of despotic power, as the only means of securing the lives 
and properties of the people. This is terrible. The war in 
which they are engaged furnishes a dreary prospect ; there 
seems to be but one ground to hope for success, which is, that 
improbable things are those which usually happen. I will not 
dwell on these topics. 
</p><p>
From what you tell me I have concluded, that the British 
ministry sent forward to Madrid my communications, to defeat 
your views. This procedure was adroit enough, but what will 
you think of the measure, when I tell you that they assigned in 
America as a reason for not treating with me, my attachment to 
France. In effect I would not listen to any overture tending 
to violate our treaties and connexion with the House of Bourbon. If the Spanish Ambassador in London had made true re 
port, my conduct in London would have served, and not injured you. I even went so far as to put my letters to you under 
cover to him ; he knowing my sentiments, first from the French 
Ambassador, and afterwards from me, in a conversation of some 
length ; but I am afraid that he thought of other things besides 
the interest of his sovereign. 
</p><p>
My letters to the British ministry were calculated to draw 
from them a pointed answer, or put them in the wrong if they 
preserved an obstinate silence. I did not believe that we should 
make a treaty with them at that time, but I thought the occasion 
suitable for taking such ground as might be useful to us hereafter. If you can again see my letters, read them, I pray you, in 
that idea, and then you can explain them so as to remove any 
evil impressions. If you have received what I wrote you at the 
same period, expressly to be communicated to the Spanish court, 
you will have seen that this was the true idea. I am, &;c.
