MY DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
It is always a great pleasure to me to hear from you, and 
would be a much greater to be with you, to converse with you 
on the subjects you mention, or any other. Possibly I may 
one day enjoy that pleasure. In the mean time, we may use 
the privilege, that the knowledge of letters affords us, of conversing at a distance by the pen. 
</p><p>
I am glad to find you are turning your thoughts to political 
subjects, and particularly to those of money, taxes, manufactures, and commerce. The world is yet much in the dark 
on these important points ; and many mischievous mistakes 
are continually made in the management of them. Most of 
our acts of Parliament for regulating them are, in my opinion, 
little better than political blunders, owing to ignorance of the 
science, or to the designs of crafty men, who mislead the 
legislature, proposing something under the specious appearance of public good, while the real aim is, to sacrifice that to 
their own private interest. I hope a good deal of light may 
be thrown on these subjects by your sagacity and acuteness. 
I only wish I could first have engaged you in discussing the 
weighty points in dispute between Britain and the colonies. 
But the long letter I wrote you for that purpose, in February 
or March, <a href='/results.php?year=1767'>1767</a>, perhaps never reached your hand, for I have 
not yet had a word from you in answer to it.
</p><p>
The act you inquire about had its rise thus. During the 
war, Virginia issued great sums of paper money for the payment of their troops, to be sunk in a number of years by taxes. 
The British merchants trading thither received these bills 
in payment for their goods, purchasing tobacco with them to 
send home. The crop of tobacco one or two years falling 
short, the factors, who were desirous of making a speedy 
remittance, sought to pay, with the paper money, bills of exchange. The number of bidders for these bills raised the 
price of them thirty per cent above par. This was deemed so 
much loss to the purchasers, and supposed to arise from a 
depreciation of the paper money. The merchants, on this 
supposition, founded a complaint against that currency to 
the Board of Trade. Lord Hillsborough, then at the head of 
that Board, took up the matter strongly, and drew a report, 
which was presented to the King in Council, against all paper 
currency in the colonies. And, though there was no complaint against it from any merchants, but those trading to 
Virginia, all those trading to the other colonies being satisfied 
with its operation, yet the ministry proposed, and the Parliament came into the making a general act, forbidding all future 
emissions of paper money, that should be a legal tender in 
any colony whatever. 
</p><p>
The Virginia merchants have since had the mortification 
to find, that, if they had kept the paper money a year or two, 
the above mentioned loss would have been avoided; for, as 
soon as tobacco became more plenty, and of course bills of exchange also, the exchange fell as much as it before had risen. 
I was in America when the act passed. On my return to England, I got the merchants trading to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, Virginia, &c., to meet, to consider and join in an 
application to have the restraining act repealed. To prevent 
this application, a copy was put into the merchants' hands of 
Lord Hillsborough's report, by which it was supposed they 
might be convinced, that such an application would be wrong. 
They desired my sentiments on it, which I gave in the paper 
I send you enclosed. I have no copy by me of the report itself ; 
but in my answer you will see a faithful abridgment of all the 
arguments or reasons it contained. Lord Hillsborough has 
read my answer, but says he is not convinced by it, and adheres to his former opinion. We know nothing can be done 
in Parliament, that the minister is absolutely against, and 
therefore we let that point rest for the present. And, as I 
think a scarcity of money will work with our other present 
motives for lessening our fond extravagance in the use of the 
superfluous manufactures of this country, which unkindly 
grudges us the enjoyment of common rights, and will tend to 
lead us naturally into industry and frugality, I am grown 
more indifferent about the repeal of the act, and, if my 
countrymen will be advised by me, we shall never ask it again. 
There is not, as I conceive, any new principle wanting, to 
account for the operations of air, and all the affections of 
smoke in rooms and chimneys; but it is difficult to advise 
in particular cases at a distance, where one cannot have all 
the circumstances under view. If two rooms and chimneys 
are " perfectly similar" in situation, dimension, and all other 
circumstances, it seems not possible, that, "in summer, when 
no fire had been in either of them for some months, and in a 
calm day, a current of air should at the same time go up the 
chimney of the one, and down the chimney of the other." 
But such difference may and often does take place, from 
circumstances in which they are dissimilar, and which dissimilarity is not very obvious to those who have little studied 
the subject. As to your particular case, which you describe 
to be, that, "after a whole day's fire, which must greatly heat 
the vent, yet, when the fire becomes low, so as not to emit any 
smoke, neighbour smoke immediately begins to descend and 
fill the room ;" this, if not owing to particular winds, may be 
occasioned by a stronger fire in another room, communicating with yours by a door, the outer air being excluded by the 
outward door's being shut, whereby the stronger fire finds it 
easier to be supplied with air down through the vent, in which 
the weak fire is, and thence through the communicating door, 
than through the crevices. If this is the circumstance, you 
will find that a supply of air is only wanting, that may be 
sufficient for both vents. If this is not the circumstance, 
send me, if you please, a complete description of your room, 
its situation, and connexion, and possibly I may form a better 
judgment. Though I imagine your Professor of Natural 
Philosophy, Mr. Russel, or Mr. George Clark, may give you 
as good advice on the subject as I can. But I shall take the 
liberty of sending you, by the first convenient opportunity, 
a collection of my philosophical papers lately published, in 
which you will find something more relating to the motions 
of air in chimneys. 
</p><p>
To commence a conversation with you on your new project, 
I have thrown some of my present sentiments into the concise 
form of aphorisms, to be examined between us, if you please, 
and rejected or corrected and confirmed, as we shall find most 
proper. I send them enclosed.
