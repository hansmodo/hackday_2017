Dear Brother: Your letter was duly received, and 
the quotation from Corwin's speech will be all I want. 
I remember the fact that when <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>'s army 
marched from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corpus christi" rel="city">Corpus Christi</a>, Texas, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>, it 
was generally noted that what few people were encountered south of the Nueces were all Mexicans. Their 
(Mexican) maps made Texas cease at that line, and our 
only title to that part of the country was Texas' claim 
to the Rio Grande as the boundary, so that the army 
officers, notably General Taylor, always ridiculed the 
action of the President and Congress " whereas 
American blood has been shed on American soil," 
etc., etc. 
</p><p>
Nevertheless war did exist and did continue till we 
had acquired California, New Mexico, etc. Our payment to Mexico of $15,000,000 at the end of the war was 
an act of generosity, and made our title one of purchase 
rather than conquest. Mexico never could have developed California as we did, and without California we 
could not have filled up the intervening space. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
