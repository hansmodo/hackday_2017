SALT LAKE CITY, September 28th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>.
</p><p>
In the afternoon, on Sunday, religious services were held in the great Mormon Tabernacle by the subordinate members of the priesthood. Brigham does not often preach, and when he does, he prefers to preach in the Chapel which is much smaller than the tabernacle, and in which it is much easier for him to speak since he has worn his lungs "threadbare," as he expresses it, by the public speaking he has done in the last twenty-five years.
</p><p
Both the chapel and tabernacle are enclosed in the same lot or square, of ten acres, by a close substantial fence or wall, fifteen feet high, and entered through massive prison-like gates. The tabernacle is an immense structure, two hundred and fifty feet long by one hundred and fifty broad, and ninety-five feet high. It is oval in its outline, roof and sides, and looks like a huge
land turtle standing motionless in its tracks. The roof rests on the side walls, and has no inside pillars to support it. It is said to be the largest building ever erected in this country, without having interior columns. It will seat ten thousand people. At one end there is an elevated platform broad enough to accommodate the entire priesthood, which consists of Brigham as Divine Master, his three divine counselors, twelve apostles, and seventy elders. On this platform there stands a magnificent organ, brilliantly gilded in front, which is seventy-five feet high, and thirty-five wide. It was built by a Mormon. Its tones are as heavy as the muttering thunders, and yet as sweet as the music of the spheres. We were politely seated by the usher in a front seat, below, with the audience. There are no galleries. The house was well filled, probably not less than six or eight thousand people were in attendance. The priesthood occupied the platform, and, judging from their numbers, I should suppose they were all there except Brigham, who seldom attends service in the afternoon. The women occupied the central seats in the main body of the tabernacle, and the men encircled them round about like a hoop. I never before saw such a sea of upturned, credulous faces, as I beheld in this assemblage. There were twice as many women as men, and
"such beauties did they grow," that you would have fancied yourself anywhere else than in a field of lilies. The audience was composed of almost every nationality known on the face of the globe. They all seemed absorbed in the services, which consisted in singing, reports from returned missionaries, and a rambling hit-and-miss discourse from one of Brigham's divine counselors. Most of the priests appeared to be elderly men, with broken constitutions, who presided with a degree of rustic dignity that appeared somewhat ludicrous.

Brigham owes his success mainly to his missionaries. He sends them by hundreds to almost every part of the civilized world. The result is, that he obtains proselytes by the thousands, every year. Five parties of immigrants were reported at the tabernacle last Sabbath, as being on their way, or as having arrived this year; each party numbering from three hundred to seven hundred persons. In one of these parties seven different languages were spoken, indicating the various countries from which they came. All this was reported as the fruit of a single year's missionary labor.

The Mormon church is rich, and transports its proselytes from Europe to Utah, at its own expense, and is afterwards reimbursed from their earnings in this country. After they have paid
this expense in work which is allotted them, they are then, like all other Mormons, required to pay tithes to the church in cash or in kind, annually, during their natural lives. These tithes in kind are either sold or applied, as needed, to support poor immigrants, until they become able to provide for themselves. Nearly all the proselytes to the Mormon faith, for the last fifteen years, are made up of the ignorant and poverty-stricken classes of the old world, who, having nothing to lose, but every thing to gain, were induced to believe that in Salt Lake Valley they would find, not only an earthly paradise, but be enriched with all the blessings and wealth that this world can bestow. It is seldom that an American joins the Mormons. When Brigham dies, if not before, the organization will explode. Already there are factions in the church, which threaten its existence. In fact, Brigham seems aware that he has an elephant on his hands, and in order to prevent a crisis, will soon be obliged to announce a new Revelation.

Salt Lake City contains about twenty thousand inhabitants. It is laid out in one hundred and eighty square blocks of ten acres each, with intervening avenues of one hundred and thirty feet in width. The blocks are then sub-divided into lots, larger or smaller, to suit the wants of the citizens,
and are generally built up with wood or adobe dwellings, in which two or three families, sometimes more, belonging to one man, are often domiciled. With some exceptions, each family occupies a distinct apartment, which is entered through a separate outside door. You can generally tell, therefore, how many families occupy the same house by the number of its front doors. The gardens are usually large, and filled with fruits, vegetables and flowers. Peaches, pears, and apples, of the largest size and finest quality I ever saw, abound here. Living streams of pure water, which descend from the neighboring snow-capped mountains, course along on either side of every avenue in the city, and are conducted in small rills through side-cuts into gardens and lawns to such extent as may be needed for the purpose of irrigation. The town is located on a plain, which extends from the base of the circular mountains on one side to the banks of the river Jordan on the other, a distance of two miles or more. This sacred river, as the Mormons esteem it, is ten or twelve rods wide, and fifteen miles long, connecting Lake Utah with Salt Lake. In the holy waters of this modern Jordan the Mormon converts are baptised, and as they say, washed of their sins. We visited the river, and picked up on its shore a black jasper, which we retain for exhibition to our friends, and as a
memento of Mormonism, the grandest humbug of the Nineteenth Century.

It is a singular fact that Salt Lake has no outlet, and though it receives into its basin several streams of fresh water, it grows none the less saline. It is, in many respects, like the Dead Sea. Neither fish, nor other living thing, can inhabit its waters. It is a fountain, if not a pillar of salt, which, though not consecrated to Lot's wife, will forever remind mankind of Brigham's wives.
</p><p>
Beside Salt-Lake valley, there are many other beautiful valleys in Utah; though much smaller in extent, they are as rich and fertile as the great valley. Nearly all of them, within a circuit of a hundred and fifty miles, are now occupied by Mormons and regularly visited by their Home Missionaries, who, in many instances, have wives and families of children in each valley with whom they stop when on the circuit. These families are expected to take care of themselves; but if unaable to do so, they receive aid from the church revenues or tithes. The entire Mormon population, at this time, is said to be nearly two hundred thousand, and is rapidly increasing. The Mormons intend to control Utah as they ever have done, when it becomes a State. The penniless dupes they import are told that Utah is "a land flowing with milk and honey," and encircled with
mountains of gold and silver, and that its climate is a summer of perpetual fruits and flowers, with bread enough and to spare; nor are they informed, especially the women, until they arrive, that polygamy is embraced in the articles of their new faith. It is then too late, destitute as they are, to retrace their steps. The priests select the handsomest girls for their wives, and do not seem to regard the act as amounting even to "a pious fraud."
</p><p>
And yet, in all this there may be a wise Providence that looks to higher, nobler and holier results. Had it not been for the early, not to say unjust, persecution of the Mormons in the Eastern States, and their forced emigration to Utah in search of protection and a peaceful home, the grand Pacific Railway, in all probability, would not have been built for at least fifty years to come. The Mormons were thus made the pioneers who took the lead and opened the gateways into a new world, where they will finally be compelled to abandon their "peculiar institution," and lose forever their identity in the flowing tide of western emigration.

Be this as it may, Salt Lake City will have a name, fame, and record, which time cannot obliterate. It is a beautiful city, and the natural scenery which surrounds it, is not only beautiful, but grand and sublime. The climate of the valley is
mild and summer-like throughout the year, and the soil as rich and productive as the garden of Eden. Nature has made the spot an earthly paradise. Brigham Young founded the city. It is and ever will be a Monument, which will commemorate his name. Yet not satisfied with this, he has already laid the foundation of a mighty temple which, when completed, will exceed in cost and grandeur the temple of Solomon. It is to be constructed of granite, with many spires and turrets, in accordance with divine instructions communicated, as he says, by an angel from Heaven, who appeared to him in a vision. We saw the foundation. It is built of immense blocks of hewn granite, procured from the mountains, eighteen miles distant, and cost a million of dollars, as we were informed by the architect. The whole cost of the temple, when finished, is estimated at three millions. Brigham is full of gigantic projects. He evidently means to survive death. He has done some good things. He educates the youth of his city, and prohibits the sale, within its limits, of all intoxicating liquors; yet tolerates a theatre, for the sake of its revenues, and often attends it himself. He maintains an efficient police force for the protection of the city and its citizens, and it is understood that he has secret agents, who execute the unrevealed decrees of the priesthood. As Head
of the Church, he owns nearly all the real estate of the city, and has several millions of gold deposited in the Bank of England, with which to meet emergencies. He has built a railroad connecting the city with the Pacific road. It became a necessity, and will soon be put into active operation. He owns the road, and will control it. None of his wives, or proselytes, will be ticketed over it, who meditate escape from Mormondom. From appearances, I am satisfied that the women of Salt Lake are generally unhappy, and if they but had the opportunity, or had wings, would leave like a flock of pigeons. But this is impossible, so long as Brigham is the great lawgiver, and accepted as the second Christ by his misguided followers. As much as he may love women, he loves gold still more, and no man understands better than he the power of a blind religious faith, or the arts by which it may be made available, in promoting selfish and unhallowed purposes. And yet time may sanctify the character of Brigham, and perhaps deify him. At any rate, he has established a religion which will not die with him; though it may undergo material modifications. Mormonism is in fact but a revised edition of Mohammedanism. Five hundred years hence it may predominate the world over. Who knows?
