REVEREND SIR: 
</p><p>
The bearer of my letter is Monsieur L'Epinasse my good 
friend who is an ingenious electrician, one of the most excellent that we have. 
</p><p>
He intends to visit Turin and being anxious to know you 
I could not deny him the honour of this note which will 
serve as an introduction to you and which I hope your goodness will excuse. I had already proposed to write you at 
length upon the subject of your last letter, but the various 
affairs in which I am engaged here, take away entirely my 
attention from philosophical matters, though I have constantly cherished the hope of returning home where I could 
find leisure to resume the studies that I have shamefully 
put off from time to time. Nevertheless I can but acknowledge my fault and ask your pardon for it, assuring you that 
no one has more perfect esteem and respect for your reverence 
than he who has the honour to be, Reverend Sir, 
</p><p>
Your ob. and humble servant 
</p><p>
BENJ. FRANKLIN.
