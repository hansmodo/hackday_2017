UNITED STATES SENATE, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, D.C., March 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1884">1884</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Brother : . . . I have made up my mind to be 
silent and neutral, and I think that it is your best 
course. You did not want the nomination. I would 
gladly take it as an honorable closing of thirty years of 
political life, but I will neither ask for it, scheme for 
it, nor have I the faintest hope of getting it, and at the 
end of my present term I intend to retire from my political life and take it easy. 
</p><p>
One thing you ought to have, and I think Congress 
would readily grant it if acceptable to you, and that is 
the detail of a staff -officer to help you with your military 
correspondence, to travel with you, and aid you in the 
social duties that will always cling to you while you 
live. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jos" rel="me">John Sherman</a>.
