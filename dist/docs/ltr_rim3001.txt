DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last of the 24th, we have opened a battery of two 
twelve-pounders, upon the ship-yards and schooner. She was 
obliged immediately to haul near the wharf, or rather as near 
the north end of the fort as she could get, This battery is 
screened from the guns of the fort by an epaulement, in a good 
measure. 
</p><p>
I fear I have neither men nor ammunition to carry on any 
attack with success ; to which purpose, it would be absolutely necessary to occupy a very advantageous piece of rising ground on 
the west side, and there erect my battery to rack their defences. 
The largest of the mortars is useless, and on the mortars I principally depended for distressing the garrison. The weather has 
been and is still so exceedingly bad, and the encampment so 
swampy, that I feel exceedingly for the troops; and withal, provisions so scanty, flour as well as pork, that it will require, not 
only good fortune, but despatch, to keep us from distress. I 
hope the thirteen-inch mortar and more powder are on the way. 
</p><p>
Allen, Warner, and Brown are at Laprairie and Longueil, 
with a party of our troops, and some Canadians. How many, I 
cannot tell. They all speak well of the good disposition of the 
Canadians. They have a project of making an attempt on <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I fear the troops are not fit for it. Carleton has certainly 
left that town, and it is in a very defenceless state. 
</p><p>
As the garrison is shut up, I hope the Kennebec expedition 
will meet with no obstruction in the attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>. Should 
any thing not go well, I tremble for the fate of the poor Canadians, who have ventured so much. What should I do with them 
should we be obliged to evacuate the country ! Though I hope 
this will not be the case. If possible, do not let us want ammunition, my dear General. I have seen Mr. Livingston, lie has a 
considerable body of Canadians in arms at Chamblee, is very 
active, and they have great confidence in him, I believe. I wish 
to have him taken notice of by the Congress, in a manner suit 
able to his services, and the risk he runs. I am, my dear Sir, 
with the warmest wishes for the recovery of your health, 
Your faithful, humble servant, 
</p><p>
