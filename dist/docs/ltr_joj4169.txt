Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 28th ult. I received your letter of the 1st of August last, and I thank you for it, and for the pamphlets 
enclosed with it. 
I am well persuaded that your sentiments relative to me 
are such as you describe ; and I assure you that mine relative to you correspond with them.

The patrons of the abolition act, and of the African Institution, certainly do honour, and will probably do more than 
ordinary good to Great Britain ; against whom complaints 
have ascended both from Asia and Africa. It is pleasing 
to behold a nation assiduously cultivating the arts of peace 
and humanity in the midst of war, and while strenuously 
fighting for their all, kindly extending the blessings of Christianity and civilization to distant countries. 
</p><p>
That your and our governments should co-operate in 
rendering their respective laws against the slave trade 
effectual, is to me very desirable, and I believe that a convention for the purpose would be approved by all, who 
think and feel as you and I do respecting that base and 
cruel traffic. Whether the times are propitious to such a 
convention, is another question. Negotiations are said to 
be pending between our government and Mr. Jackson. I 
can discern no objection to his being instructed to propose 
such a measure. They who offer to do what is fit and right 
to be done, cannot be losers by it. I can do but little â€” 
that little shall be done. 
</p><p>
The information you give me respecting your family, 
and your friendly inquiries concerning mine, gratify me 
not a little. I rejoice that while perturbation reigns abroad, 
you enjoy in tranquillity at home the comforts mentioned 
in the 128th Psalm. 
</p><p>
In my family there have been, since the date of my last 
letter, some painful and some pleasing events. Death has 
deprived my eldest daughter of an excellent husband, and 
of the only two children which she had. On the other 
hand, my son has gradually recovered his health, and has 
married an amiable young lady, who, about a year ago, 
brought him a son. My other children- are well, and doing 
well. 
As to myself, sickness confined me to the house last winter, and I am still more of an invalid than a convalescent. 
However difficult the task, such visitations should be received and borne with grateful, as well as patient resignation. 
</p><p>
The observation you cite from Hooker is very just, and 
so are your remarks on this turbulent and transitory scene. 
To see things as they are, to estimate them aright, and to 
act accordingly, is to be wise. But you know, my dear 
sir, that most men, in order to become wise, have much to 
unlearn as well as to learn, much to undo as well as to do. 
The Israelites had little comfort in Egypt, and yet they 
were not very anxious to go to the promised land. Figuratively speaking, we are all at this day in Egypt, and a 
prince worse than Pharaoh reigneth in it. Although the 
prophet " like unto Moses" offers to deliver from bondage, 
and invites us to prepare and be ready to go with him, 
under Divine guidance and protection, to the promised land ; 
yet great is the number who prefer remaining in slavery 
and dying in Egypt. 
</p><p>
If this letter should reach you, be so good as to let me 
know it, and name some person in London to whose care 
I may transmit future ones for you. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes for your health and happiness, and 
with real esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your faithful and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
