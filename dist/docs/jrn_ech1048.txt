We are now in the midst of winter, or the rainy season. It has been raining steadily for the last eight or ten days. Our mountain streams are all impassable, and communications between here and Stockton and San Francisco are entirely cut off, except by persons travelling on horseback. The mud is ankle deep, and still rain continues to pour down.

An auriferous quartz vein has been discovered in the northern part of the town, and many people are getting half crazy at the prospect of a rich reward. But I fear they will be woefully disappointed. Practical men, men who have been used to this kind of mining, say that it will not prove sufficiently rich to warrant any one in erecting machinery and employing labor while the rates of everything continue as at present.

I see by the papers from the Atlantic States that the Disunionists in the South count on California joining them in a Southern confederacy. Now, since California is admitted, let them try her. One universal shout would go forth from California for the Union and if needs be, will fight for it. We laugh in our sleeve at the antics of these madmen.
