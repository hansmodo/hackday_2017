<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='17'>17th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Captain Shannon, of the Kirkwood Rangers, called and stayed three hours. Has not been under fire 
yet, but is keen to see or to hear the flashing of the guns; proud of himself, proud of his company, but proudest of all 
that he has no end of the bluest blood of the low country in his troop. He seemed to find my knitting a pair of socks a 
day for the soldiers droll in some way. The yarn is coarse. He has been so short a time from home he does not know how 
the poor soldiers need them. He was so overpoweringly flattering to my husband that I found him very pleasant company.
