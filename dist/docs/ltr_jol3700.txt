My dear General, 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival here, I found that our Minister 
Plenipotentiary had received the instructions, &c., 
transmitted to him, and commenced the negotiation 
with which we were charged; and that he had received the following communication from the Count de Vergennes. 
</p><p>
" It is impossible for his Majesty to favor a loan 
in this kingdom, because it would prejudice those 
which he has occasion to make himself for the support of the war ; but his Majesty, to give the United 
States a signal proof of his friendship, grants them 
under the title of a donation, six millions of livres 
tournois. As the American army is in want of arms, 
clothing, &c., <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Mr. Franklin</a> will be so good as to give 
a note of those articles; they will be procured of 
the best quality, and at the most reasonable price. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> will be authorized to give drafts 
for the remaining sum; but the drafts must be at 
long sight, in order to facilitate the payments from 
the Royal Treasury. The Courts of Petersburg and 
Vienna have offered their mediation. The King has answered, that it would be personally agreeable to 
him, but that he could not as yet accept it, because 
he has allies whose concurrence is necessary. Mr. 
Franklin is requested to communicate the overture 
and answer to Congress, and to engage them to send 
their instructions to their Plenipotentiaries. It is supposed the Congress will accept the mediation with 
eagerness." 
</p><p>
After my first interview with the Count de Vergennes, I presented to him a Memorial/'' in which I 
transcribed the principal part of the letter your Excellency delivered to me ,at New Windsor, and represented the insufficiency of the succour proposed by his 
Majesty. I have since given in an extract of the 
estimate of the Board of War, accompanied with a 
letter, urging the necessity of despatch in furnishing 
those essential supplies. My personal solicitations 
have not been wanting to induce a prompt and favorable answer; but M. de Maurepas and the Count de Vergennes both inform me, that nothing can be 
determined until the return of M, de Castries, who 
is expected the day after to-morrow; that the matter 
must be deliberated, and they will consider what can 
be done. M. Necker will be consulted to-day. 
</p><p>
M. de Vergennes complains very much of the excessive demands of Congress, and seems to entertain 
an idea that they wish to throw too much of the 
burden of the war on their ally. He says that the 
exertions and expense with which France supports 
the war in different parts of the world, fully employ 
her means ; that her public credit has its limits, to 
surpass which would be fatal to it. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, my expectations are very moderate. The naval dispositions were made before my 
arrival; five ships of the line for the East Indies 
with troops ; twenty, commanded by De Grasse, for 
the West Indies, twelve of which are to proceed to 
America. They will probably arrive on our coast in 
July. We have no news yet of their departure. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will see that I have written in a 
great hurry. In my next, I hope to be able to give 
you more particular intelligence of our affairs. In 
the mean time, I take the liberty of troubling you to 
present my respects to Mrs. Washington, my love to 
the family and the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, the want 
of whose letters is a great disadvantage to me. My 
only hope of obtaining additional succour is founded 
on the exalted opinion which the Ministers have of 
your Excellency, and every thing which comes from 
you. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect 
and most tender attachment, &c., 
</p><p>
