RIO DE JANEIRO, March 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>
</p><p>
I have just finished writing to Father and will tell the rest of my story to you. Read his letter for a preface and then commence on 'Adventures in Rio.'
</p><p>
Pulled ashore this morning. (The Custom House officer tells us to pull alongside of the guard ship every time and get liberty. A darky sticks his coca up over the rail and says: 'You go ashore?' 'Yes.' 'Go.' And we go.) After Captain Cole had entered the vessel and we had imbibed two mint juleps and swallowed the ice (for be it known unto you that although it is March, the mercury only stands at 86° in the shade) and had cucumbers and water cresses and lettuce for dinner and oranges and bananas for dessert (doesn't this make your mouth water?) we proceeded to find a guide, or country pilot, and found just the fellow exactly. He knew everything about the country besides a great deal that he didn't know. He took us to a stable and we bargained for the cattle through him for six milreas for the day. Behold us all mounted, seven Yankees and the guide, on the easiest-going, ambling horses that ever I mounted. We put in the spurs and dashed down the streets, scattering swarms of darkies with great baskets on their heads and astonishing the natives. I tell you we were full of fun--just like boys let loose from school.

Our road lay along the shores of the Bay and it is lined with most splendid residences--and such gardens! They have a climate here in which things will grow! The plants were all new to me, but the cocoanut and the banana trees are the finest. The gardens are fenced with
brick walls, plastered over with large arches for gateways and fountains and statuary scattered about. The houses I can't describe. Instead of being made to keep the cold out, the main thing is to let it in--to keep cool as possible.
</p><p>
We rode along among the mountains, every now and then meeting parties of our countrymen, cruising around on jackasses, some in carriages having a jolly time. I was surprised to meet several of my old friends from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> in this far-off country. Our guide took us out to the Botanical Garden, about eight miles. We left our horses at a public house close by and ordered a Brazilian dinner (à la mode) and went into the garden. This is the nearest the tales of the Arabian Nights of anything I can imagine. Here we wandered through groves of orange trees where they are as plentiful as apples in an orchard. We saw the breadfruit, tea plant, coffee and dates growing here. The garden is on a level plot of ground completely enclosed in mountains and contains about ten acres. It has streams of water running through it and is handsomely laid out in walks, arbors, etc. They allowed us to pluck as many flowers as we liked and I cut a bamboo stick which lies in my berth. I wish I could have sent you a bouquet.

Having satisfied our curiosity and given the little darkies some milreis, we adjourned to dinner. Here we found for the first course ham and eggs, omelette, roast chicken, beefsteak, etc.; next, bananas, oranges, guava jelly, citron, green cheese and claret and Madeira wine; next, coffee--and such coffee! It was the pure juice and would bear up a marlinspike point downwards. After having done justice to this, as a particular favor, we sang 'Oh Susannah' and several other melodies which probably those hills and valleys had never heard before. Then we mounted our steeds and started.
</p><p>
It is very seldom you get a sight of the ladies (I mean the 'Ton') here. They appear to be kept very snug and are not seen gawking out of the windows or walking the streets. On our way back, however, we spied three at an open window in one of the most stylish houses we had seen. They looked white enough and delicate, and one was very pretty.
</p><p>
As we got close to the city we were overtaken by a genuine Broadway Omnibus, the first ever seen in the country, I guess. It was brand new and drawn by eight jackasses and postillions for drivers. It was filled with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> boys who saluted us with shouts of 'Broadway Bleeker! Ride up!' It really looked natural. We formed an escort with our eight horsemen and escorted it into town, drove to the house of the American Consul, Gorham Parks, and gave him nine cheers which brought out several females on the balcony, who bowed their thanks. As the stage thundered through the streets (a new sound to them here) it brought crowds to the windows to see the wonder and we got a glimpse of quite a number of the natives. The people are very polite. If we touch our caps to the officers we meet, they return it.

In the Rue Ovidoro (the Broadway of Rio) the shops are very handsome. Some of the finest artificial stores I ever saw. The churches are rich in ornaments as well as bells, which they amuse themselves by ringing most all the time. I should like to visit some of the convents, but can't without taking the veil, which I don't feel like doing.
</p><p>
There are three theatres, but I can't hear of any opera. We intend to visit one of them before we leave. Tomorrow is Sunday and we are going to visit some of the churches. Monday we shall get ready for sea. Tuesday, sail.
</p><p>
We enjoy ourselves very much on board. Our library contains over 150 volumes and we have cards, chess and
backgammon--besides the beautiful scenery: sky and water. 'Sometimes we ship a sea and sometimes see a ship.'
</p><p>
The evenings in the tropics coming out were beautiful. The air was so mild and there appeared to be twice as many stars as there are North. The only trouble is, we get so confounded lazy, having nothing to do but kill time--and a warm climate at that. We have some music on board: two violins and two flutes and two of the passengers sing. We practice every day.
