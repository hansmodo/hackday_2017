Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My anxiety for the supplies of the army has 
brought me to this place, in order that I might satisfy myself as to the quantity on hand, and the 
means of forwarding them. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='met'>General Knox</a> has communicated to me your Excellency's orders on this 
subject. Nothing short of them would, I am fully 
persuaded, be of' sufficient force to produce the desired effect; and the knowledge of them will, in a 
great measure, render the execution of them unnecessary. Impressed with this idea, I have been long 
laboring to bring Congress to assume the power which 
will enable them to call forth the resources of the 
States, but unhappily without effect. However, I hope| 
much from their pressing and reiterated demands.
What principally induced me to trouble your Excellency at this time, is an apprehension which I, in 
common with many other gentlemen, entertain of the 
propriety of leaving the command at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> in the hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=roh' rel=''>General Howe</a>. Having no personal acquaintance with him, I can have no prejudices, but 
the gentlemen from the southward by no means speak 
so favorably of him as I could wish. But in this, 
I conceive, that as yet he has had no opportunity of 
acquiring a military character. But confidence, which 
is so necessary to inspire courage, especially in militia, will, I fear, be wanting in him. If I might presume so far, I should beg leave to submit it to your 
Excellency, whether this post might not be most safely confided to <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>General Arnold</a>, whose courage is undoubted, who is the favorite of our militia, and who will agree perfectly with our Governor. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will not consider this as designed to convey the most distant reflection on <a href='/results.php?tla=roh' rel=''>General Howe</a>, of whom I know nothing but by report, which 
may very possibly be ill grounded; but, if the most 
distant doubt remains, in a matter of so much moment, I conceive it should be removed. I make no 
other apology for the liberty I take, than the motive 
that suggests it, which has before now induced your 
Excellency to pardon an interference in matters to 
which I was no more competent than the present. 
This hasty letter is written while the express waits, 
whom I am unwilling to detain longer than while I 
declare the respect and esteem with which I am, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
