MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RECEIVED to-day your favor of the 24th, and it 
made the day more tolerable. Your health and spirits 
always promote mine. 
</p><p>
We have had more company to-day than ever upon 
any occasion. Thirty or forty gallons of punch, wine 
in proportion and cake in abundance. The news by 
the America, Captain Jenkins, arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a>, made every body gay but me. Not a word of 
T. B. A. I shall be uneasy till I hear further. He 
could not be so imprudent as to omit that opportunity. 
</p><p>
You have an admirable faculty of employing your mind, and in the affairs of the farm, materials for it. 
I want my talkative wife, but fear, if she should attempt to come here, she would not talk farther than 
Worcester or Springfield. But my wife was too studious and addicted to scribbling, to talk much to me when she was here. 
</p><p>
Our people grow amazingly fearless and valiant in 
proportion as they hear the English beat the French ; 
and that formidable combinations are forming against 
them by Turkey, Russia, Austria, and England. I 
don t like this bravery which grows in proportion as 
danger appears to lessen. I like that fortitude which 
increases as danger grows, in a good cause. The 
English have exhibited an amazing example of skill 
and intrepidity, perseverance and firmness at sea. 
We are a chip of that block, and we could do as we 
pleased, at least as we ought, upon the watery element, 
if it were not that we shall excite jealousy in the 
English navy. We must, however, stand for our 
right. We must adopt their motto, " Dieu et mon droit." 
</p><p>
Yours forever and ever, 
</p><p>
