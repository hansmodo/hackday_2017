Wigfall was here last night. He began by wanting to hang Jeff Davis. My husband managed him 
beautifully. He soon ceased to talk virulent nonsense, and calmed down to his usual strong common sense. I knew it 
was quite late, but I had no idea of the hour. My husband beckoned me out. "It is all your fault," said he. 
" What ? " Why will you persist in looking so interested in all Wigfall is saying? Don't let him catch your eye. 
Look into the fire. Did you not hear it strike two ?

This attack was so sudden, so violent, so unlocked for, I could only laugh hysterically. However, as an obedient 
wife, I went back, gravely took my seat and looked into the 
fire. I did not even dare raise my eyes to see what my husband was doing if he, too, looked into the fire. Wigfall 
soon tired of so tame an audience and took his departure.

General Lawton was here. He was one of <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Stonewall's</a> generals. So I listened with all my ears when he said: 
Stonewall could not sleep. So, every two or three nights you were waked up by orders to have your brigade in 
marching order before daylight and report in person to the Commander. Then you were marched a few miles out and 
then a few miles in again. All this was to make us ready, ever on the alert. And the end of it was this: <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Jackson's</a> 
men would go half a day's march before Peter Longstreet waked and breakfasted. I think there is a popular delusion 
about the amount of praying he did. He certainly preferred a fight on Sunday to a sermon. Failing to manage 
a fight, he loved best a long Presbyterian sermon, Calvinistic to the core.

He had shown small sympathy with human infirmity. 
He was a one-idea-ed man. He looked upon broken-down men and stragglers as the same thing. He classed all who 
were weak and weary, who fainted by the wayside, as men wanting in patriotism. If a man's face was as white as 
cotton and his pulse so low you scarce could feel it, he looked upon him merely as an inefficient soldier and rode 
off impatiently. He was the true type of all great soldiers. Like the successful warriors of the world, he did not value 
human life where he had an object to accomplish. He could order men to their death as a matter of course. His 
soldiers obeyed him to the death. Faith they had in him stronger than death. Their respect he commanded. I 
doubt if he had so much of their love as is talked about while he was alive. Now, that they see a few more years 
of Stonewall would have freed them from the Yankees, they deify him. Any man is proud to have been one of the 
famous Stonewall brigade. But, be sure, it was bitter hard 
work to keep up with him as all know who ever served under him. He gave his orders rapidly and distinctly and 
rode away, never allowing answer or remonstrance. It was, Look there see that place take it ! When you 
failed you were apt to be put under arrest. When you reported the place taken, he only said, Good ! :

Spent seventy-five dollars to-day for a little tea and sugar, and have five hundred left. My husband's pay never 
has paid for the rent of our lodgings. He came in with dreadful news just now. I have wept so often for things 
that never happened, I will withhold my tears now for a certainty. To-day, a poor woman threw herself on her dead 
husband's coffin and kissed it. She was weeping bitterly. So did I in sympathy. 
</p><p>
My husband, as I told him to-day, could see me and everything that he loved hanged, drawn, and quartered 
without moving a muscle, if a crowd were looking on; he could have the same gentle operation performed on himself 
and make no sign. To all of which violent insinuation he 
answered in unmoved tones: " So would any civilized man. Savages, however Indians, at least are more dignified in 
that particular than we are. Noisy, fidgety grief never moves me at all ; it annoys me. Self-control is what we all 
need. You are a miracle of sensibility; self-control is what you need. " "So you are civilized ! " I said. Some day I mean to be."
