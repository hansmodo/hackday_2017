DEAR COLONEL, 
</p><p>
All your movements since you left this place have [been] very 
agreeable to me. I am greatly obliged to you for your exertions, 
and am glad to hear, that with spirit the officers and men under 
you have distinguished themselves. You are all entitled to the 
thanks of the public; mine you have most cordially. 
</p><p>
I had no idea, when I wrote to General Bayley, to which 
letter you refer, of your retreating while there was a probability 
of success ; neither do I now wish it. Colonel "Woodbridge will 
afford you all the assistance in his power. I had yesterday 
<a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s repeated orders to join him at Stillwater. I must 
do it myself with all the troops I can collect here. He had a skirmish, the night before last, with the enemy. He took two 
hundred and fifty prisoners and three field-pies. General Warner and you must act your own judgments with respect to at 
tacking the enemy's lines, continuing the siege, or retiring. I 
am this moment going to set off; expect to see <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> 
to-morrow. I shall leave General Bayley at Castleton, who will 
afford you every in supplies. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. While at Skenesborough, I could get no advice from you, 
and supposed our expresses were cut off. Indeed, I was con 
firmed in this opinion, after being informed that one of our boats 
was fired on by the Tories, and one man killed. The boat went, 
as afterwards I was told, into East Bay. I therefore took post 
for one night at Castleton.
