MY very deserving friend, Mr. Gerry, sets off tomorrow for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, worn out of health, by the fatigues 
of this station. lie is an excellent man, and an active, able statesman. I hope he will soon return 
hither. I am sure I should be glad to return with 
him, but I cannot. I must wait to have the guard relieved.

There is a most amiable, laudable and gallant 
spirit prevailing in these middle colonies. The militia turn out in great numbers, and in high spirits, in 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware, so that we hope to resist Howe and his myrmidons.

Independence is, at last, unanimously agreed to in 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> Convention. You will see, by the 
newspapers enclosed, what is going forward in Virginia and Maryland and New Jersey. Farewell! 
farewell ! infatuated, besotted, step-dame. I have not time to add more, than that I receive letters from you 
but seldom of late. Tomorrow's post, I hope, will bring me some. So I hoped of last Saturday's and last Tuesday's.

Ever Yours,
