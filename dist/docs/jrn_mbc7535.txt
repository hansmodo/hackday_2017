<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='25'>25th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Find every one working very hard here. As I dozed on the sofa last night, could hear the 
scratch, scratch of my husband's pen as he wrote at the table until midnight.

After church to-day, Captain Ingraham called. He left me so uncomfortable. He dared to express regrets that he 
had to leave the United States Navy. He had been stationed in the Mediterranean, where he liked to be, and 
expected to be these two years, and to take those lovely 
daughters of his to Florence. Then came <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Abraham Lincoln</a>, and rampant black Republicanism, and he must lay 
down his life for South Carolina. He, however, does not make any moan. He says we lack everything necessary in 
naval gear to retake Fort Sumter. Of course, he only expects the navy to take it. He is a fish out of water here. 
He is one of the finest sea-captains ; so I suppose they will soon give him a ship and send him back to his own element.

At dinner Judge - - was loudly abusive of Congress. He said: " They have trampled the Constitution under 
foot. They have provided <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>President Davis</a> with a house." He was disgusted with the folly of parading the President at the inauguration in a coach drawn by four white horses. Then some one said Mrs. Fitzpatrick was the only lady 
who sat with the Congress. After the inaugural she poked Jeff Davis in the back with her parasol that he might turn 
and speak to her. " I am sure that was democratic enough," said some one. 
</p><p>
Governor Moore came in with the latest news a telegram from <a href='/results.php?tla=wfp' rel='acquaintance met'>Governor Pickens</a> to the President, " that a 
war steamer is lying off the Charleston bar laden with reenforcements for Fort Sumter, and what must we do? " 
Answer : Use your own discretion ! There is faith for you, after all is said and done. It is believed there is still 
some discretion left in South Carolina fit for use.

Everybody who comes here wants an office, and the 
many who, of course, are disappointed raise a cry of corruption against the few who are successful. I thought we 
had left all that in Washington. Nobody is willing to be out of sight, and all will take office.

" Constitution " Browne says he is going to Washing 
ton for twenty- four hours. I mean to send by him to Mary Garnett for a bonnet ribbon. If they take him up as a 
traitor, he may cause a civil war. War is now our dread. Mr. Chesnut told him not to make himself a bone of contention. 
</p><p>
Everybody means to go into the army. If Sumter is attacked, then Jeff Davis's troubles will begin. The Judge 
says a military despotism would be best for us anything to prevent a triumph of the Yankees. All right, but every 
man objects to any despot but himself. 
</p><p>
Mr. Chesnut, in high spirits, dines to-day with the Louisiana delegation. Breakfasted with " Constitution " Browne, who is appointed Assistant Secretary of State, and so does not go to Washington. There was at table the 
man who advertised for a wife, with the wife so obtained. She was not pretty. We dine at Mr. Pollard's and go to 
a ball afterward at Judge Bibb's. The New York Herald 
says <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> stood before Washington's picture at his inauguration, which was taken by the country as a good sign. 
We are always frantic for a good sign. Let us pray that a Caesar or a Napoleon may be sent us. That would be our 
best sign of success. But they still say, No war. Peace let it be, kind Heaven !

Dr. De Leon called, fresh from Washington, and says <a href='/results.php?tla=wfs' rel=''>General Scott</a> is using all his power and influence to prevent officers from the South resigning their commissions, among other things promising that they shall never be sent 
against us in case of war. Captain Ingraham, in his short, curt way, said: " That will never do. If they take their 
government's pay they must do its fighting." 
</p><p>
A brilliant dinner at the Pollards's. Mr. Barnwell took me down. Came home and found the Judge and Governor Moore waiting to go with me to the Bibbs's. And they say it is dull in Montgomery ! Clayton, fresh from Washington, was at the party and told us there was to be peace.
