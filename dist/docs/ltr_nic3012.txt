SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 6th instant I received, and laid 
before the General Assembly. It had great weight; 
and I believe that no supplies to the enemy's ships 
would have been permitted, had it not appeared to 
us that the members of the Continental Congress 
were of opinion that they should be continued. The 
following is an extract from our Delegates on that 
subject. "A Memorial from the Town of Newport, 
forwarded to us by express, having been referred to 
the General Assembly, we now inclose that, with the 
papers pertinent thereto. We should not do justice to the benevolence of Congress, or to the Distressed situation of the town, if we did not acquaint 
you that all the gentlemen, who spoke in this debate, 
expressed the most tender regard for the distressed 
people, and gave it as their opinion that, as long as 
the ships of war now in the harbour could be sup 
plied with fresh provisions, beer, and such like necessaries for their own immediate support, consistently with 
the great principles of the general good and safety 
of America, the town ought to he permitted to furnish them; the greatest care being taken by government that no more than the barely necessary supplies 
be furnished from time to time, lest the common enemy 
in other parts of the Continent should, through them, 
obtain provisions." In consequence of which the 
General Assembly have ordered that Captain Wallace 
should be supplied, as you will see by the inclosed 
vote. But, as he may cannonade, and even burn the 
town, a discretionary power, by a private vote, which 
it is designed should be kept a profound secret, is 
given to the commander of the forces on Rhode 
Island to permit supplies in cases of imminent danger, until the next session, to be holden on the last 
Monday in next month. 
</p><p>
Similar measures to those taken by Connecticut, 
as mentioned in your letter, have been adopted by 
this Colony. Besides- which, the commanding officer 
of any body of Continental troops is empowered to 
impress carriages, &c. 
</p><p>
The General Assembly ordered an Address to the 
Congress, a copy of which I do myself the honor 
to inclose you. We are not without hopes that the 
Congress will take the whole brigade into their service, especially as the necessity, arising from so powerful an invasion, of establishing the whole force we 
have ordered, is clear and manifest. From the nature 
of the Avar, and the circumstances of the Colonies, I 
think every idea of partial and Colonial defence 
ought to be given up. There must be a supreme, 
superintending power, to exert and direct the force 
of the whole, for the defence and safety of all ; other 
wise the exertions and burdens will not only be very unequal, to the greatly endangering the union, 
upon which the welfare of America depends, but 
Colony after Colony may be subdued without the 
chance of making resistances. I shall only add, on 
this head, that unless the Continent enter upon the 
defence of the Colony, it must be abandoned, to the 
great detriment of the common cause. I beg the 
favor of your Excellency seriously to consider this 
matter, and to give us your assistance with the members of the Congress for procuring such a body of 
forces as the interest of this and the United Colonies 
in general shall require. 
</p><p>
We had procured upwards of an hundred blankets, 
which were designed for the army under your immediate command; but the descent upon Prudence 
obliged us to send forty of them to our troops upon 
that Island; and to supply the additional forces, ordered to be raised, will demand every blanket that 
can be spared in the Colony. I am, with great respect and esteem, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant,
