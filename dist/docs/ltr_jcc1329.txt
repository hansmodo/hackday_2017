</p><p>
SIR: In answering your letter of the 13th instant, I wish to be distinctly understood, that however high my respect is for your personal character, and the 
exalted station which you occupy, I cannot recognise the right on your part to 
call in question my conduct on the interesting occasion to which your letter 
refers. I acted, on that occasion, in the discharge of a high official duty, and under responsibility to my conscience and my country only, in replying, then, 
to your letter, I cio not place myself in the attitude of apologising for the pan 
I may nave acted, or ofp alTiating my conduct on the accusation of Mr, 
Crawford. My course, I trust, requires no apology; and if it did, I have too 
much self respect to make it to any one in a case touching the discharge of 
my official conduct. I stand on vely different ground. I embrace the opportunity which your letter offers, not for the purpose of making excuses, but 
as a suitable occasion to place my conduct in relation to an interesting public 
transaction in its proper light; and I am gratified that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, though 
far from intending me a kindness, has afforded me such an opportunity. 
</p><p>
In undertaking to place my conduct in its proper light, I deem it proper to 
premise that it is very far from my intention to defend mine by impeaching 
yours. Where we have differed, I have no doubt that we differed honestly; 
and in claiming to act on honorable and patriotic motives myself, I cheerful 
ly accord the same to you. 
</p><p>
I know not that I correctly understood your meaning; but, after a careful 
perusal, I would infer from your letter that you had learned for the first 
time, by Mr. Crawford's letter, that you and I placed different constructions 
on the orders under which you acted in the Seminole war; and that you had 
been Led to believe, previously? by my letters to yourself and Governor 
that I concurred with y-,u in thinking that your orders were i.-ite i.ieu to 
authorize your attack on the Spanish posts in Florida. Under these impressions, you would seem to impute to me some degree of duplicity, or at least 
concealment, which required on my part explanation. I hope that my 
conception of your meaning is erroneous; but if it be not, and your meaning 
be such as I suppose, I must be permitted to express my surprise at the misapprehension, which, I feel confident, it will be in ray power to correct by 
the most decisive proof, drawn from the public documents, and the correspondence between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> and yourself, growing out of the decision 
of the cabinet on the Seminole affair, which passed through my hands at the 
time, and* which I now have his permission to use, as explanatory of my - 
opinion, as well as his, and the other members of his administration. To 
Save you the trouble of turning to the file of your correspondence, I have 
enclosed extracts from the letters, which clearly prove that the decision of 
the cabinet on the point, that your orders did not authorize the occupation of 
St. Mark s and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, was early and fully made known to you, and that 
I, in particular, concurred in the decision. 
</p><p>
Mr. Monroe's letter of the 19th July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, the first of the series, and 
written immediately after the decision of the cabinet, and from which I 
have given a copious extract, enters fully into the views taken by the Executive of the whole subject. In your reply of the 19th of August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, you 
object to the construction which the administration had placed on your orders, and you assign your reasons at large, why you conceived that the orders under which you acted authorized your operations in Florida. Mr Monroe replied on the 20th October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>; and, after expressing his regret 
that you bad placed a construction on your orders different from what was 
intended, he invited you to open a correspondence with me, that your conception of the meaning of your orders and that of the administration, 
might be placed, with the reasons on both sides, on the files of the War 
Department. Your letter of the 15th ot November, in answer, agrees to 
the correspondence as proposed, but declines commencing it; to which Mr. 
Monroe replied by a letter of the 21st December, stating his reasons for 
suggesting the correspondence, and why he thought that it ought to commence 
with you. To these, I have added an extract from your letter of the 7th 
December, approving of Mr. Monroe's message at the opening of Congress, 
which, though not constituting a part of the correspondence from which I 
have extracted so copiously, is intimately connected wity the subject under 
consideration. 
</p><p>
But it was not by private correspondence only, that the view which the 
Executive took of your orders was made known. In his message to the 
House of Representatives of the 25th Maj-ch, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, long before information 
of the result of your operation in Florida was received, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> states, 
that " orders had been given to the General in command not to enter Florida, unless it be in pursuit of the enemy, and, in that case, to respect the 
Spanish authority, wherever it may be maintained; and he will be instructed to withdraw his forces from the province as soon as he has reduced that 
tribe (the Seminoles) to order, and secured our fellow-citizens in that 
quarter, by satisfactory arrangements, against its unprovoked and savage 
hostilities in future." In his annual message at the opening of Congress, in 
November of the same year, the President, speaking of your entering Florida, says: " On authorizing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">Major General Jackson</a> to enter Florida, in 
pursuit of the Seminoles, care was taken not to encroach on the rights of 
Spain." Again: " In entering Florida to suppress this combination, no 
idea was entertained of hostility to Spain; and, however justifiable the commanding General was, in consequence of the misconduct of the Spanish officers, in entering St. Mark s and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, to terminate it, by provingto the 
savages, and iheir associates, that they could not be protected, even there, 
yet the amicable relation between the U States and Spain could not be altered by that act alone. By ordering the restitution of those posts, those 
relations were preserved. To a change of them the power of the Executive 
is deemed incompetent. It is vested in Congress alone." The vtew taken 
of this subject met your entire approbation, as appears from the extract of 
your letter, of 7th December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, above referred to. 
</p><p>
After such full and decisive proof, as it seems to me, of the view of the 
Executive, I had a right, as I supposed, to conclude that you long since 
knew that the administration, and myself in particular, were of the opinion 
that the orders under which you ^cted^d.J^QL.^^9J^ze^^ ^o, occupy the 
Spanish posts; but I now infer trom your letter, to which this is in answer, 
that such conclusion was erroneous, and that you were of the impression, till 
you received Mr. Crawford's letter, that I concurred in the opposite construction, which you gave to your orders, that they were intended to authorize you to occupy the posts. You rely for this impression, as I understand 
you, on certain general expressions in my letter to Governor Bibb, of Alabama, of the 13th of May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, in which I stated that " <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> is vested with full powers to conduct the war in the manner he shall judge 
best," and also in my letter of the 6th February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, in answer to yours of 
the 20th January of the same year, in which I acquainted you with the 
entire approbation of the President of all the measures you had adopted to 
terminate the rupture with the Seminole Indians." 
</p><p>
I will not reason the point, that a letter to Gov. Bibb, which was not 
communicated to you, which bears date long after you had occupied St. Mark's, and subsequent to the time you had determined to occupy <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, 
(see your letter of June 2d, 1S18, to me, published with the Seminole documents,) could give you authority to occupy those posts. I know, that, in 
quoting the letters, you could not intend such absurdity, to authorize such 
an inference; and I must therefore conclude that it was your intention by 
the extract to show, that, at the time of writing the letter, it was my opinion 
that the orders under which you did act were intended to authorize the occupation of the Spanish posts. Nothing could have been more remote 
from my intention in writing the letter. It would have been in opposition 
to the view which I have always taken of your orders, and in direct contradiction to the President s message of the 25th March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, communi 
cated but a few weeks before to the House of Representatives, (already referred to,) and which gives a directly opposite construction to your orders. 
In fact, the letter, on its faee, groves that it was not the intention of the 
Government to occupy the Spanish posts. By referring to it, you will see 
that I enclosed to the Governor a copy of my orders to General Gaines, of 
the 16th December, 1817, authorizing him to cross the Spanish line, and 
to attack the Indians within the limits of Florida, unless they should take 
shelter under a Spanish post, in which event, he was directed to report immediately to the Department, which order Governor Bibb was directed to 
consider as his authority for carrying the war into Tlorida, thus clearly establishing the fact that the order was considered still in force, ind not superseded by that to you, directing you to assume the command in the Seminole war. 
</p><p>
Nor can my letter of the 6th of February be, by any sound rule of construction, interpreted into an authority to occupy the Spanish posts, or as 
countenancing, on my part, such an interpretation of the orders previously 
given to you. Your letter of the 20th January, to which mine is an answer, 
bears date at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, before you set out on the expedition, and consists 
of a narrative of the measures adopted by you, in order to bring your forces 
into the field, where they were directed to rendezvous, the time intended 
for marching, the orders for supplies given to the contractors; with other details of the same kind, without the slightest indication of your intention to 
act against the Spanish posts; and the approbation of the President of the 
measures you had adopted could be intended to apply to those detailed in 
your letter. I do not think that your letter of the 13th instant presents the 
question, whether the Executive or yourself placed the true construction, 
considered as a military question, on the orders under which you acted. 
But I must be permitted to say, that the construction of the former is in 
strict conformity with my intention in drawing up the orders; and that, if 
they be susceptible of a different construction, it was far from being my in 
tention they should be. I did not then suppose, nor have! ever, that it was 
in the power of the President, under the Constitution, to order the occupation of the posts of a nation with whom we were not at war; (whatever might 
be the right of the General, under the lav/ of nations, to attack an enemy 
sheltered under the posts of a neutral power;) and had I been directed by 
the President to issue such order, I should have been restrained from 
complying by the higher authority of the Constitution, which I had sworn 
to support. Nor will I discuss the question, whether the order to General 
Gaines, inhibiting him from attacking the Spanish posts, (a copy of which 
was sent to you,) was in fact, and according to military usage, an order to 
you, and of course obligatory until rescinded. Such, certainly, was my opinion. I know that yours was different. You acted on your construction, 
believing it to be right; and, in pursuing the course which I have done, I 
claim an equal right to act on the construction which I conceived to be correct, knowing it to conform to my intentions in issuing the orders. But, in 
waiving now the question of the true construction of the orders, I wish it 
however to be understood, it is only because I do not think it presented by 
your letter, and not because I have now, or ever had, the least doubt of the 
correctness of the opinion which I entertain. I have always been prepared 
to discuss it on friendly terms with you, as appears by the extracts from Mr. Monroe s correspondence, and more recently by my letter to you of the 
30th of April, 1828, covering a copy of a letter of Major H. Lee, in which I decline a correspondence that he had requested on the subject of the construction of your orders. In my letter to Major Lee, I stated, that, "as you 
refer to the public documents only for the construction which the Executive 
gave to the orders, I infer that on this subject you have not had access to 
the General s (Jackson s) private papers; but if I be in an error, and if the 
construction which the administration gave to the orders be not stated with 
sufficient distinctness in the then President s correspondence with him, I will 
cheerfully give, as one of the members of the administration, my own views 
fully in relation to the orders; if it be desired by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>; but it is 
only with him, and at his desire, that, under existing circumstances, I should 
feel myself justified in corresponding on this or any other subject connected 
with his public conduct:" to which I added, in my letter to you, covering a 
copy of the letter from which the above is an extract, ** with you I cannot 
have the slightest objection to correspond on this subject, if additional in 
formation be desirable." You expressed no desire for further information, 
and I took it for granted that Mr. Monroe's correspondence with you, and 
the public documents, furnished you a full and clear conception of the construction which the Executive gave to your orders; under which impression 
I remained till I received your letter of the 13th instant. 
</p><p>
Connected with the subject of your orders, there are Certain expressions 
in your letter, which, though I am at a loss to understand, I cannot pass 
over in silence. After announcing your surprise at the contents of Mr. Crawford's letter, you ask whether the information be correct, "under all 
of the circumstances, of which you and I are both informed, that any attempt 
seriously to affect me was moved and sustained by you in cabinet council, 
when, as is known to you, I was executing the tvishes of the Government." 
If by wishes, which you have underscored, it be meant that there was any 
intimation given by myself, directly or indirectly, of the desire of the Government that you should occupy the Spanish posts, so far from being 
ct informed," I had riot the slightest knowledge of any such intimation, nor 
did I ever hear a whisper of any such before. But I cannot imagine that it 
is your intention to make a distinction between the wishes and the public 
orders of the Government, as I find no such distinction in your correspondence with the President, nor in any of the public documents; but, on the 
contrary, it is strongly rebutted by your relying for your justification constantly and exclusively on your public orders. Taking, then, the "wishes 
of the Government" to be but another expression for its orders, I must refer 
to the proof already offered, to show that the wishes of the Government, in 
relation to the Spanish posts, were not such as you assume them to be. 
</p><p>
Having, I trust, satisfactorily established that there has not been the least 
disguise as to the construction of your orders, I will now proceed to state 
the part which I took in the deliberations of the cabinet. My statement 
will be confined strictly to myself, as T do not feel myself justified to speak 
of the course of the other members of the administration; and, in fact, only 
of my own in self-defence, under the extraordinary circumstances connected 
with this correspondence. 
</p><p>
And here I must premise that the object of a cabinet council is not to 
bring together opinions already formed, but to form opinions on the course 
which the Government ought to pursue, after full and mature deliberation. 
Meeting in this spirit, the first object is a free exchange of sentiment, in 
which doubts and objections are freely presented and discussed. It is, I 
conceive, the duty of the members thus to present their doubts and objections, and to support them by offering fully all of the arguments in their 
power, but. at the same time to take care not to form an opinion till all the 
facts and views are fully brought out, and every doubt and objection carefully weighed. In this spirit I came into the meeting. The questions involved were numerous and important: whether you had transcended your 
orders; if so, what course ought to be adopted; what was the conduct of 
Spain and her officers in Florida; what was the state of our relations with 
Spain, and, through her, with the other European powers a question, at 
that time, of uncommon complication and difficulty. These questions had 
all to be carefully examined and weighed, both separately and in connexion 
before a final opinion could be wisely formed; ard never did I see a deliberation in which every point was more carefully examined, or a greater soli 
citude displayed to arrive at a correct decision. I was the junior member of 
the cabinet, and had been but a few months in the administration. As Secretary of War, I was more immediately connected with the questions 
whether you had transcended your orders, and, if so, what course ought to 
be pursued. I was of the impression that you had exceeded your orders, 
and had acted on your own responsibility; but I neither questioned your 
patriotism nor your motives. Believing that where orders were transcended, investigation, as a matter of course, ought to follow, as due in justice 
to the Government and the officer, unless there be strong reasons to the 
contrary, I came to the meeting under the impression that the usual course 
ought to be pursued in this case, which I supported by presenting fully and 
freely all the arguments that occurred to me They were met by other arguments, growing out of a more enlarged view of the subject, as connected 
with the conduct of Spain and her officers, and the course of policy which 
honor and interest dictated co be pursued towards her, with which some of 
the members of the cabinet were more familiar than myself, and whose duty 
it was to present that aspect of the subject, as it was mine to present that 
more immediately connected with the military operations. After deliberately weighing every question, when the members of the cabinet came 
to form their final opinion, on a view of the whole ground, it was unanimously determined, as I understood, in favor of the course adopted, and 
which was fully made known to you by Mr. Monroe's letter of the 19th of 
July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>. I gave it my assent arid support, as being that which, under 
all the circumstances, the public interest required to be adopted. 
</p><p>
I shall now turn to the examination of the version which <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> 
has given of my course in this important deliberation, beginning with his 
"apology for having disclosed what took place in a cabinet meeting." He 
says; c&lt; In the summer after the meeting, an extract of a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> was published in a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a> paper, in which it was stated that I 
(<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>) had proposed to arrest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, but that he was 
triumphantly defended by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. This letter, I always believed, was written by Mr. Calhoun, or by his direction. It had 
the desired effect; General Jackson became inimical to me, and friendly to 
Mr Calhoun." 
</p><p>
I am not at all surprised that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> should feel that he stands in 
need of an apology for betraying the deliberations of the cabinet. It is, I 
believe, not only the first instance in our country, but one of a very few 
instances to be found in any country, or any age, that an individual has felt 
absolved from the high obligation which honor and duty impose on one 
situated as he was. It is not, however, my intention to comment on the 
morality of his disclosure; that more immediately concerns himself; and 
I leave him undisturbed to establish his own rules of honor and fidelity, in 
crder to proceed to the examination of a question in which I am more immediately concerned the truth of his apology. 
</p><p>
I desire not to speak harshly of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>. I sincerely commiserate 
his misfortune. I may be warm in political contests, but it is not in me to 
retain enmity, particularly towards the unsuccessful. In the political contest which ended in 1825, Mr. Crawford and myself took opposite sides; 
but whatever feelings of unkindness it gave rise to have long since passed 
away on my part. The contest ended in an entire change of the political 
elements of the country; and, in the new state of things which followed, I 
found myself acting with many of the friends of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, to whom 
I had been recently opposed, and opposed to many of my friends, with whom 
I had, till then, been associated. In this new state of things, my inclination, my regard for his friends who were acting with me, and the success 
of the cause for which we were jointly contending, all contributed to remove from my bosom every feeling towards him, save that of pity for his- 
misfortune. I would not speak a harsh word, if I could avoid it; and it is 
a cause of pain to rne that the extraordinary position in which he has placed 
me, compels me, in self-defence, to say any thing which must, in its consequence, bear on his character. 
</p><p>
I speak in this spirit when I assert, as I do, that his apology has no foundation in truth. He offers no reason for charging me with so dishonorable 
an act as that of betraying the proceedings of the cabinet, and that for the 
purpose of injuring one of my associates in the administration. The charge 
rests wholly on his suspicion, to which I oppose my positive assertion that 
it is wholly unfounded. I had no knowledge of the letter, or connexion 
with it; nor do I recollect that I ever saw the extract. But why charge me, 
and not <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>? I had then been but a few months in the administration, and Mr. Crawford and myself were on the best terms, without a 
feeling, certainly on my part, of rivalry or jealousy. In assigning the motive that he does for the letters, he forgets the relation which existed then 
between you and himself. He says it had the desired effect; that you became friendly to me, and extremely inimical to him. He does not remember that your hostility to him long preceded this period, and had a very different origin. He certainly could not have anticipated that a copy of his 
letter would be placed in your hand. 
</p><p>
These are not the only difficulties accompanying his apology: there are 
others still more formidable, and which must compel him to assign some 
other reason for disclosing the proceedings of the cabinet. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gmd" rel="colleague met">Mr. McDuffie's</a> letter to me, of the 14th instant, of which I enclose a 
copy, proves that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> spoke freely of the proceedings of the 
cabinet on his way to Georgia, in the summer of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>; and dates will show 
that he could not at that time have seen the extract from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a> piper, on which he now rests his apology. The deliberation of the cabinet 
took place between the 14th and 25th July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>. On the former day, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> returned to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> from London, and on the latter a general 
exposition of the views of the Government in relation to the operations in 
Florida appeared in the Intelligencer. The letter of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> to you. 
of the 19th July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, fixes probably the day of the final decision of the 
cabinet Mr. Crawford passed through Augusta on the llth August, as 
announced in the papers of that city, on which day, or the preceding, his 
conversation, to which Mr. McDuffie s letter relates, must have taken place. 
On a comparison of these dates, you will see that it was impossible that Mr. 
Crawford could have seen the extract from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a> paper when he 
was in Edgefield, and he must consequently find some otiier apology for his 
disclosures. This was not the only instance of his making the disclosures 
before he saw the extract. He was at Milledgvillc on the 16th of August, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, a few days after he passed through Augusta; and a little after, there 
appeared a statement in the Georgia Journal, somewhat varied from that 
made in Edgefield, but agreeing with it in most of the particulars. I cannot 
lay my hand on the article, but have a distinct recollection of it. You nodoubt remember it. Circumstances fixed it on Mr. Crawford, and it has not, 
to my knowledge, been denied. 
</p><p>
With such evidence of inaccuracy, either from want of memory, or some 
other cause, in what relates to his own motives and actions, it would be unreasonable to suppose that Mr. Crawford's statements will prove more correct in what relates to me. I will now proceed to examine them. He first states that I proposed that you should "be punished in some form, or reprimanded in some form;" and to make my course more odious, as I suppose, he adds, that "Mr. Calhoun did not propose to arrest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>." I will not dwell on a statement which, on its face, is so absurd. How 
could an officer under our law be punished without arrest and trial? And 
to suppose that I proposed such a- course, would indeed be to rate my understanding very low. 
</p><p>
The next allegation requires much more attention. He says: " Indeed, 
my own views on the subject had undergone a material change after the cabinet had been convened. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> made some allusion to a letter that 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> had written to the President, who had forgotten that he 
had received such a letter, but said if he had received such a one, he would 
find it, and went directly to his cabinet, and brought it out. In it General Jackson approves of the determination of the Government to break up 
tf Amelia island and Galveztown; and gave it also as his opinion that Florida 
ought to be taken by the United States. He added, it might be a delicate 
matter for the Executive to decide, but if the President approved of it, he 
had only to give a hint to some confidential member of Congress, say 
Johnny Ray, and he would do it, and take the responsibility on himself. I 
asked the President if the letter had been answered: he replied, no; for that 
he had no recollection of receiving it. I then said that I had no doubt that 
General Jackson, in taking <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, believed he was doing what the Executive wished. After that letter was produced, unanswered, I should have 
opposed the infliction of punishment on General Jackson, who had considered the silence of the President as a tacit consent; yet it was after the 
letter was produced and read, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> made the proposition to the 
cabinet for punishing the General." Again: " I do not know that I ever 
hinted at the letter to the President, yet that letter had a most important 
bearing on the deliberations of the cabinet, at least in my mind, and possibly on the minds of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and the President, but neither expressed 
any opinion on the subject. It seems it had none on the mind of Mr. Calhoun, for it made no change in his conduct." 
</p><p>
It will be no easy matter for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> to reconcile the statement 
which he has thus circumstantially made, with his conduct in relation to 
the Seminole affair, from the time of the decision of the cabinet till the 
subject ceased to be agitated. 
</p><p>
How will he, in the first instance, reconcile it with his Edgefield statement, 
of which <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gmd" rel="colleague met">Mr. McDuffie's</a> letter gives an account? The contrast between 
that and the present is most striking; to illustrate which, I will give an extract from Mr. McDuffie's letter. Mr. McDuffie's letter says, that "he" (<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>) "stated that you" (<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>) "had been in favor of an inquiry into the conduct of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, and that he was the only member of the cabinet that concurred with you. He spoke in strong terms of 
disapprobation of the course pursued by General Jackson, not only in his 
military proceedings, but in prematurely bringing the grounds of his defence 
before the country, and forestalling public opinion; thus anticipating; the ad- 
ministration. On this point, he remarked, that, if the administration could 
not give direction to public opinion, but permitted a military officer, who had violated his orders, to anticipate them, they had no business to be at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, and had better return home." Such was the language then 
held, and such his tone of feeling at that time. We hear not one word of 
the letter which makes so conspicuous a figure in his present statement; not 
one word of the change it effected in his mind in relation to your conduct; 
not a word of his taking a course different from me: but, on the contrary, he 
then stated, directly, that he concurred with me in favoring an inquiry, and 
indicated no difference on any other point; and so far from exempting you 
from Ihe charge of breach of orders, as he now attempts to do, he asserted, 
positively, that you had violated your orders. Shall we find the explanation 
of the contrast in the two statements in the difference of his motives then 
and now? Is his motive now to injure me, and was it then to attack another 
member of the administration? Or must it be attributed, as the more charitable interpretation, to the decay of memory? Whatever may be the true 
explanation, all will agree that a statement, when events were fresh in the 
memory, is to be trusted in preference to one made twelve years after the 
transaction, particularly if the former accords with after events, and the latter does not, as is the case in this instance. At the next session of Congress, 
your conduct in the Seminole war was severely attacked in both branches of 
the Legislature. Let us see if the course pursued by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> and 
his personal and confidential friends can be reconciled to the statement which 
he now gives of his course in the cabinet. Mr. Cobb, of Georgia, now no 
more, was then a prominent member of the House of Representatives. He 
was the particular, personal, and confidential friend of Mr Crawford, his 
near neighbor, and formerly a law student under him. What part did he 
take? He ied the attack; he moved the resolutions against you; he accused 
you expressly of the violation of your orders, and sustained the accusation 
with all his powers. All this accords with Mr. Crawford's statement of 
his sentiment and his course at the time; but how can it be reconciled to his 
present statement? How could he, on any principle of justice, stand by and 
hear you thus falsely accused, in the face of the world, when he, according 
to his showing now, knew that it was all false? And how can he reconcile 
his silence then, when you stood so much in need of his assistance, with his 
disclosures now, when the agitation has long since passed away, and his aid 
no longer required? But let us turn to the other branch of the Legislature, 
and see whether any occurrence there can explain this apparent mystery. 
General Lacock, of Pennsylvania, the particular friend of Mr. Crawford, 
and in the habit of constant intercourse with him, was the chairman of the 
committee in that tody to whom the part of the message which related to 
the Seminole war was referred. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a>, then and now a Senator from 
Georgia, and who now acts a prominent part in the transaction which has 
given rise to the present correspondence, was also a member, and was then, 
as he is now, an intimate, personal, and political friend of Mr. Crawford, 
With two such able and influential friends on the committee, he had the 
most favorable opportunity that could be offered to do you justice. According to his own statement, he felt no obligation to observe silence in relation 
to the proceedings of the cabinet. Why, then, did he not interpose with his 
friends on the committee to do you justice? That he did not, I need not 
offer you arguments to prove. The report of the committee is sufficient 
testimony. Should he say that he was restrained by feelings of delicacy 
from interfering with his friends on the committee, how will he reconcile, 
on the principles of justice and honor, his silence after the report so severely assailing your motives and conduct was made, when, admitting his present 
statement, it was completely in his power to shield you from censure? 
</p><p>
But why should I waste time and words to prove that Mr. Crawford's 
whole course is in direct conflict with his present statement of the proceedings of the cabinet, when there remains an objection that cannot be surmounted? The statement is entirely destitute of foundation. It is not true. 
Strange as it may appear, after an account so minute and circumstantial, no 
such letter as he refers to was ever before the cabinet, or alluded to in its deliberations. My memory is distinct and clear, and is confirmed by the no less 
distinct recollection of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wiw" rel="met colleague">Mr. Wirt</a>, as will fully appear by 
copies of their statements, herewith enclosed. Feelings of delicacy, growing out of the political relation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bwc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crowninshield</a>, the 
other members of the then administration, both towards you and myself, have 
restrained me from applying for their statements, but I have not the least apprehension that they would vary from Mr. Monroe's or Mr. Wirt's.
Comment is useless, I will not attempt to explain so gross a misstaternent 
of the proceedings of the cabinet, but will leave it to those friends of Mr. Crawford who have placed him in this dilemma to determine whether his 
false statement is to be attributed to an entire decay of memory, or to some 
other cause; and if the former, to exempt themselves from the responsibility of thus cruelly exposing a weakness which it was their duty to conceal. 
</p><p>
It now becomes necessary to say something of your letter of the 6th January, to which <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> has given, io his statement, so much prominence. My recollection in relation to it accords with Mr. Monroe's statement. I came into his room when he had apparently just received the letter. He was indisposed at the time. I think he opened the letter in my 
presence, and, finding that it was from you, he gave me the letter to read. I 
cast my eyes over it, and remarked that it related to the Seminole affair, and 
would require his attention, or something to that effect: I thought no more of 
it. Long after, I think it was at the commencement of the next session of 
Congress, I heard some allusion which brought the letter to my recollection. 
It was from a quarter which induced me to believe that it came from Mr. 
Crawford. I called, and mentioned it to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a>, and found that he had 
entirely forgotten the letter. After searching some time, he found it among 
some other papers, and read it, as he told me, for the first time. 
</p><p>
Having stated these facts, I should be wanting in candor were I not also 
to state, that, if the facts had been otherwise; had Mr. Monroe read your letter, and intentionally omitted to answer it, and had it been brought before the cabinet, in my opinion it would not have had the least influence on its 
deliberation. The letter was not received till several weeks after the orders to you were issued, and could not, therefore, as you know, have had 
any influence in drawing them up; and such, I conceive, was your opinion, 
as I do not find any allusion to the letter in your public or private correspondence at the time, which would not have been the case, had it, in your 
opinion, formed a part of your justification. You rested your defence on 
what I conceive to be much more elevated ground on the true construction, 
as you supposed, of your orders, and the necessity of the measures which 
you adopted to terminate the war, and not on any supposed secret wish of 
the Executive in opposition to the public orders under which you acted Mr. Crawford, in placing your justification noy) on such grounds, not only 
exposes your motives to be questioned, but, as far as his acts can, greatly weakens your defence. 
</p><p>
On a review of this subject, it is impossible not to be struck with the time 
and mode of bringing on this correspondence. It is now twelve years since 
the termination of the Seminole war. Few events in our history have 
caused so much excitement, or been so fully discussed, both in and out of 
Congress. During a greater part of this long period, Mr. Crawford was a 
prominent actor on the public stage, seeing and hearing all that occurred, 
and without restraint, according to his own statement, to disclose freely all 
lie knew; yet not a word is uttered by him in your behalf; but now, when 
you have triumphed over all difficulties, when you no longer require defence, 
he, for the first time, breaks silence, not to defend you, but to accuse one 
who gave you every support in your hour of trial in his power, when you 
were fiercely attacked, if not by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> himself, at least by some of 
his most confidential and influential friends. Nor is the manner less remarkable than the time. Mr. Forsyth, a Senator from Georgia, here in his 
place, writes to Mr. Crawford, his letter covering certain enclosures, and 
referring to certain correspondence and conversations in relation to iny conduct in the cabinet deliberation on the Seminole question. Mr. Crawford 
answers, correcting the statements alluded to in some instances, and confirming and amplifying in others; which answer he authorizes Mr. Forsyth 
to show me, if he pleased. Of all this, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a> gives me not the 
slightest intimation, though in the habit of almost daily intercourse in the 
Senate; and instead of showing me Mr. Crawford's letter, as he was authorized to do, I hear of it, for the first time, by having a copy put into my 
hand under cover of your letter of the 13th instant a copy with important 
blanks, and unaccompanied with Mr. Forsyth's letter, with its enclosures, 
to which Mr. Crawford's is in answer. 
</p><p>
Why is this so? Why did not Mr. Forsyth himself show me the letter 
the original letter? By what authority did he place a copy in your hands? 
None is given by the writer. Why is your name interposed? Was it to 
bring me into conflict with the President of the United States? If the object of the correspondence between Mr. Crawford and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a> be to 
impeach my conduct, as it would seem to be, by what rule of justice am I 
deprived of evidence material to my defence, and which is in the hands of 
my accusers of a copy of Mr. Forsyth's letter, with the enclosures; of a 
statement of the conversation and correspondence of the two individuals 
whose names are in blank in the copy of Mr. Crawford's letter furnished 
me? Why not inform me who they are? Their testimony might be highly 
important, and even their names alone might throw much light on this 
mysterious affair. 
</p><p>
I must be frank. I feel that I am deprived of important rights by the interposition of your name, of which I have just cause to complain. It deprives me of important advantages, which would otherwise belong to my position. By the interposition of your name, the communication which would 
exist between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a> and myself, had he placed Mr. Crawford's letter in my hands, as he was authorized to do, is prevented, and I am thus deprived of the right which would have belonged to me in that case, and 
which he could not in justice withhold, of being placed in possession of all 
the material facts and circumstances connected with this affair. In thus 
complaining, itis not my intention to attribute to you any design to deprive me 
of so important an advantage. I know the extent of your public duties, and how 
completely they engross your attention. They have not allowed you sufficient 
time for reflection in this case, of which evideace is afforded by the ground 
that you assume in placing the copy of Mr. Crawford's letter in my hand, 
which you state was submitted by his authority. I do not so understand 
him; the authority was, as I conceive, to Mr. Forsyth, and not to yourself, 
and applied to the original letter, and not to the copy, both of which, as I 
have shown, are very important in this case, and not mere matters of form. 
I have asked the question, Why is this affair brought up at this late period, 
and in this remarkable manner? It merits consideration, at least from myself. I am in the habit of speaking my sentiments and opinions freely, and 
I see no cause which ought to restrain me on the present occasion. I should 
be blind not to see that this whole affair is a political manoeuvre, in which the 
design is that you should be the instrument, and myself the victim, but in 
which the real actors are carefully concealed by an artful movement. A 
naked copy, with the names referred to in blank, affords slender means of de 
tection; while, on the contrary, had I been placed, as I ought to have been, in 
possession of all the facts which I was entitled to be, but little penetration would 
probably have been required to see through the whole affair. The names 
which are in blank might of themselves, through their political associations, 
point directly to the contrivers of this scheme. I wish not to be misunderstood. I have too much respect for your character to suppose you capable 
of participating in the slightest degree in a political intrigue. Your character is of too high and generous a cast to resort to such means, either for your 
own advantage or that of others. This the contrivers of the plot well knew; 
but they hoped through your generous attributes, through your lofty and 
jealous regard for your character, to excite feelings through which they expected to consummate their designs. Several indications forewarned me, 
long since, that a blow was meditated against me; I will not say from the 
quarter from which this comes; but in relation to this subject, more than two 
years since, I had a correspondence with the District Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York, on the subject of the proceedings of the 
cabinet on the Seminole war, which, though it did not then excite particular 
attention, has since, in connexion with other circumstances, served to direct 
my eye to what was going on. 
</p><p>
Of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> I speak with pain, and only in self-defence; but, that 
you may more fully realize the spirit which actuates him, and how little 
scrupulous he is of the means that he uses where I am concerned, I would 
refer you for illustration to facts in the possession of one who stands to you 
in the relation of a constitutional adviser, and who from his character is entitled to your entire confidence; I mean the Postmaster General. No one 
knows better than yourself how sacred the electoral college for the choice of 
President and Vice President should be considered in our system of government. The electors are the trustees of the high sovereign power of the 
people of the States, as it relates to the choice of those magistrates; and on 
the degree of fidelity with which the trust may be discharged depends, in a 
great degree, the successful operation of out system. In order to prevent, as 
far as practicable, political intrigue, or the operation of extraneous influence 
on the choice of the electoral college, it is provided that they shall meet in 
their respective States, and that they shall vote, throughout the Union, on the 
same day, and be selected within thirty-four days of the time designated for 
the election; thus excluding with the greatest care all other influence on the 
choice of the electors, except the will of their constituents; but where the object 
was to injure me, the sacred character of the college was an insufficient restraint. Mr. Crawford wrote to Major Barry in October, 1828, ( a copy of 
whose letter he has furnished me at my request,) requesting him earnestly to 
use his influence with the electors not to vote for me as Vice-President, 
though he could not be ignorant that I had been nominated for that office, 
on the preceding 8th January, when your friends nominated you, in a State 
convention, for the high station which you now hold, and that the electors 
were pledged to vote for you as President, and myself as Vice-President. 
This is not the only instance of his interference. He pursued the same 
course in Tennessee and Louisiana, as I am informed on the highest authority. 
</p><p>
At aa earlier period, he resorted to means not much less objectionable to 
injure my standing, and to influence, as far as I was concerned, the election. 
I am not ignorant of his correspondence with that view, and which, I feel 
confident, has not escaped your observation. But I will not dwell on this 
disagreeable subject. I have no resentment towards <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>. I have 
looked on in silence, without resorting to any means to counteract the injury 
which he intended me; and I now depart from the rule which I have care 
fully observed ever since the termination of the presidential election in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>, because his present attack comes through a channel, my high respect 
for which would not permit me to be silent. I have, however, in noticing 
what I could not pass over, situated as I now am, endeavored to limit 
myself by the Hue of self-defence, and if I have apparently gone beyond 
in making any remarks on his conduct, which his letter did not naturally 
suggest, my apology will be found in the necessity of showing the state of 
his feelings towards me, so that the motive which influenced him in the 
course which has caused this correspondence may be fully understood.
