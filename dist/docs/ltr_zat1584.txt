My dear Richard, 
</p><p>
Your highly esteemed letter of the 11th ins t on the subject of my 
nomination as a candidate for the presidency at the coming election in 
Nov r next, by the Whig Nat Convention which recently met in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, as well as in relation to other grave matters connected with & growing out of said nomination, has this moment reached me, for the 
information therein contained as well as for your prudent suggestions, you 
have my sincere thanks 
</p><p>
I am free to say I feel no little gratification at the marked distinction 
which has been done me, on the occasion referred to, more particularly so, 
coming as it does from one of the purest, most talented & patriotic body 
of men for their number, ever met togather in this or any country for a 
similar object, to disignate who was to rule over them 
</p><p>
By nominating me as a suitable candidate for the first office in the 
gift of a great & free people, & I may with great propriety say the first in 
the world, during a state of high political excitement of a party character, 
without asking pledges of any kind, is an evidence of their confidence in 
my honesty, truthfulness integrity has but few parallels anywhere, at any 
rate none since the days of the Father of his Country, under all the circumstances attending said nomination it is an honor of which I may be 
justly proud, & one for which I am duly grateful, & which I will endeavor 
to continue to merit; & am satisfied I feel more elated on acc t of this 
flattering compliment, than I shall do at any time should the good people 
think proper to elevate me to the presidential chair 
</p><p>
I have not yet officially been notified of my nomination but expect it 
will be the case in a few days, as I observe from the proceedings of the 
convention, that Gov r Morehead 1 their president was designated to communicate to me the result of their labors ; as soon as he does so, I pre 
sume I shall accept said nomination without making objections or taking 
exceptions to any portions of it, indorsing the whole including the course 
of the Louisiana delegation & that of Judge Saunders; & would have 
accepted the Democratic nomination had it been tendered me in like manner, leaving me untrammeled & unpledged to carry out their particular 
views as regards this or that measure My answer to the governors 
letter informing me of my nomination will be brief, & after due consider 
ation, barely accepting with due thanks &c &c for the honor done me ; 
unless there is something more contained in the letter referred to than I 
calculate on, or expect ; which of course I must be governed by, & hope 
under any contingency my reply will be such as my friends will approve, 
what my enemies may think of it gives me no concern 
When Judges Saunders & Winchester two old personal & political 
friends, were on their way to the Eastward as delegates to attend the Whig 
Nat 1 Convention, they addressed me a joint communication requesting to 
know what course I wished them to pursue at the organization of said 
convention & during its proceedings, & that I would inclose my answer 
under cover to a friend in Washington in time for them to receive it, 
before the meeting of said convention, which was done, & in which I 
stated, that as circumstances might occur after their arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
connected with the proceedings of the convention which I could not 
forese, & as I felt my cause as well as my honor safe in their keeping, 
they must assume the necessary responsibility to act for me in certain 
contingencies which could not be foreseen, in which I would acquiesce ; 
that if my friends went into the convention which I presumed they would 
do, if things were conducted on fair & correct principles, which I had no 
right to doubt would be the cas, as their constituents had sent there for 
that object, they would be bound to support the nominees of the convention, be whom he might & which they ought to do heart & soul, leaving 
me out of the question, if I failed to get the nomination ; that I was not 
a candidate further than my friends had made me so, without any agency 
of mine directly, or indirectly in the matter, in whose hands I was, & who 
were at liberty to withdraw or drop me, which I could not do on my own 
accord, & which they ought to do, provided they could take up a more 
available candidate & particularly one better qualified to serve the country, 
& should they succeed in electing him, it would neither disappoint or 
mortify me, on the contrary if he was honest, truthful & patriotic I will 
rejoice at the result ; under said instructions my friends from Louisiana 
were fully justified in taking the course they did, at any rate I approve it ; 
& in doing so, I do not conceive I have departed from the position I 
assumed ever since my humble name was brought before the country for 
the high office in question, or that it involves any inconsistency on my 
part, others however may think so, in which case I will not attempt to 
change their opinions, even if I had the vanity to believe I could do so ; 
and however I may regret losing the support of, I have no doubt of many 
high minded & honorable men in consequence of the course things have 
taken, yet it is gratifying to me to know there has been no concealments 
in the matter & that there is ample time between now & the y th Nov r for 
all who have been disappointed in relation to this or any other matter, or 
even desire to change their positions, to select another candidate for the 
presidency, for whom they can vote, without doing violence to their 
feelings 
</p><p>
As to the course pursued by the Louisiana deligation 1 I observe it 
has been made a prominent element of attack on them to bring about a 
colision between them & myself on the score of varacity, with a hope of 
sowing distrust among the whig ranks, which seems to have been done 
about the same time from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> ; at the latter place the 
most contemptable meas possible was resorted to, to bring about the result 
referred to ; individuals under the disguise of gentlemen posted up here 
from the city who after calling on me, in the character of friends, & being 
kindly treated, returned to the city & give I am credibly informed circulation to the most palpable falsehod touching this matter ; which was im 
mediately sized on by the several papers hostile to me, & published among 
other matters that there was a letter in the city from me which would make 
its appearance the next day, in which I had denounced the course of the 
Louisiana delegation, and would not accept the nomination of the 
whig convention, & that the whigs would have to call another convention to select an other candidate &c &c, all of which was gotten up 
for effect without the slightest authority, by men who professed great 
frankness & independence, & who have professed to be my warmest 
friends, & most devoted advocates for the presidency ; all of which has 
somewhat the appearance of a concerted attack ; I see I aMrailed at in 
advance by the loco press to prevent my accepting the whig nomination, 
but they may rail on I will not consult as to the proper course for me 
to pursue in this or any other matter 
</p><p>
I never had any aspirations for civil office of any kind, & even if I 
had in former days age & more than 40 years spent in the military service 
of the Republic, many of which have been in the field under canvas from 
the heads of the Mississippi to the burning sands of Florida & the inhospitable climate of Mexico, which has had the effect to allay the same, so 
much so, should I reach the presidency by the too great partiality of my 
countrymen I would go into the office more from a sense of duty than 
from inclination 
</p><p>
Your Aunt whose health is only tolerable is the only member of the 
family with me ; Betty is on a short visit to a friend some 40 miles distant, & Dick is on the plantation Your Aunt joins me in wishing to 
be most kindly remembered to your uncle & family, & wishing you continued health & prosperity through a long life 
</p><p>
I remain your 
</p><p>
Devoted Uncle
