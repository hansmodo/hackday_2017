Dear Brother : . . . I'm afraid you are too late to save 
Kentucky. The young active element is all secession, 
the older stay-at-homes are for Union and Peace. But 
they will not take part. In the meantime the Southern 
Confederacy looking forward to this very condition of 
things has armies organized, equipped, &c., and have the 
Railroads so disposed that by concentration they can 
overwhelm any part. There was one Camp south and 
East of Lexington formed by Lt. Nelson, U. S. Navy, 
now commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas, and an army 
under Zollicoffer of Tennessee is advancing on it. Gen. 
Anderson at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, Ky., has sent in that direction all 
the regiments from Ohio. Here the secessionists secured 
several trains of cars and locomotives, moved them 
South and broke up the bridges so that they are safe. 
We came out here hastily to secure Muldraugh's Hill, a 
kind of chain which separates the waters of Salt Creek 
from Green River. We are at one part of this chain 
where the Railroad from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a> crosses 
it, but it is by no means a strong point. I have examined the country all around, but every strong defensible 
position is devoid of water, and our absolute dependence 
on that element forces me into a position which upon 
being surrounded by vastly superior forces will be a 
complete ambush. The people are all unfriendly. Their 
trade and relations have been with the South, and there 
their feelings lie, so that when Buckner sees fit he can 
come up from Green River where he now is with from 
8,000 to 15,000 men. We have 5,000, and the Railroad 
behind is guarded by three more, but this road can be 
cut at a hundred different points which would starve us 
out or force me to strike out and live on a country which 
produces only beef and corn. I have Col. Gibson's Ohio 
Regt., 3 Indiana Regts. and 2 of Kentucky, but I must 
say that these latter were made up in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> and 
over in Indiana and [are] composed most of strangers 
to Kentucky. It will require near one hundred thousand 
men in Kentucky, and where they are to come from I 
don't know. 
</p><p>
If I am reinforced as promised I will advance to a 
place called Moline where the ground is better for a 
desperate fight. . . . 
</p><p>
I see they are falling back from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. I hope 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> will press forward and keep them all engaged ; 
in like manner the forces in Missouri should be employed 
without a minute's delay, and for that reason I am sorry 
to see a change of plans. . . . 
</p><p>
If the Confederates take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> and get Kentucky 
this Winter you will be far more embarrassed than if 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> had fallen into their possession, as whatever 
nation gets the control of the Ohio, Mississippi and 
Missouri Rivers will control the Continent. This they 
know and for this they will labor. You of the North 
never fully appreciated the energy of the South. My 
health is good, but as you perceive I am far from easy 
about the fate of Kentucky.

Affectionately,
