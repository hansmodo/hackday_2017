I thank you, my dearest friend and father, for your 
tender letter of the 26th ult. I was upon the point of 
writing to you the 22d , when I was ordered to fly 
with important dispatches to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Gov'r Trumbull</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a> and the Count D'Estaing. I commissioned one of my friends to acquaint you of the circumstance ; 
but perhaps the multiplicity of affairs in which I left 
him involved will have made him lose sight of the 
matter. In 48 hours over the worst, and in some 
parts the most obscure road that I ever travel d, I 
arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, had a conference with <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>, and proceeded immediately with pilots provided for the French fleet, down to Point Judith. 
Boats were soon provided and everything put in readiness for boarding the Admiral as soon as he should 
announce himself by the firing of five cannon. Here 
I waited in a very disagreeable kind of company till 
the morning of the 29th , for tho the squadron anchored off Block island the preceding afternoon, the 
haziness of the weather rendered them invisible to us. 
In the morning when the fog was dissipated, their 
appearance was as sudden as a change of decorations 
in an opera house. Upon my delivering <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a>'s dispatches, and <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s containing a 
plan of operations, the Admiral informed me his 
intention had been to proceed immediately into the 
main channel of Newport and attack the enemy's batteries. The day, however, began to be too far spent. 
It was expedient to distribute intelligent pilots in the 
squadron, and, in pursuance of <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s plan, 
the main channel was blocked up with the squadron. 
A ship of the line was ordered up the west channel, 
and two frigates and a tender up the east, By consulting the map, you will find that there are three 
entrances to Rhode Island ; one on the east of Rhode 
Island between it and the main, called the Seakonnet 
passage ; one on the west, between it and Cononicut 
island, which is the principal or main passage ; a third 
between Cononicut and the main land, commonly 
called the western passage. In the first <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> 
informed the Admiral there were two galleys and one 
small frigate ; in the second, two frigates besides two 
galleys, and two or three frigates at Newport ; in the 
last, two small frigates ; farther, that he estimated the 
enemy's land force, including three regiments posted 
on Cononicut at 7,000 effective. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a>'s plan founded on these data, was 
that the Admiral should detach a proper force up the 
eastern and western channels, to take the enemy's 
ships stationed in each ; to block up the main channel 
with the remainder of the squadron, so as effectually 
to cut off the retreat of their ships, and to prevent the 
arrival of reinforcements. The French ships in the 
eastern and western channels were afterwards to cover 
the passage of the American troops from Tiverton and 
Bristol. The troops were not to amuse themselves 
with attacking the works in the northern part of the 
island ; but a sufficient detachment was to be left to 
be a guard upon the troops posted in those works, 
while the main body was to advance rapidly to the 
attack of the fort and redoubts, which immediately 
environ the town of Newport. At the moment of 
that attack the count was to force the passage into 
</p><p>
Newport harbour, silence the enemy's batteries, cannonade the town, and disembark his marines and 
land forces at the most proper place for seconding the American attack. 
</p><p>
The Sagittaire, a ship of the line, went up the 
western passage on the morning of the 30th , and was 
fired upon by a two gun battery of 24 pounders, which 
the enemy had on the west side of Cononicut. The 
Sagittaire returned a broadside as she passed, and we 
discovered from the Admiral's ship an explosion at the 
battery, which induced us to believe that the enemy 
had abandoned it. 
</p><p>
The ship received two scratches in her hull, and proceeded to her station. 
</p><p>
The Aimable and Alemene frigates accompanied 
by the Stanley (prize) tender, went up the eastern 
passage. Upon their approach, the enemy set fire to 
the Kingfisher 20 gun sloop, and to the Lamb galley 
mounting and sent the Spitfire galley mountiiie: 
in form of a fire ship. The Count de Grace commanded the boat which was ordered to tow the 
latter off. She blew up soon after the grapnel was 
fixed, and the gallant officer with his crew escaped 
unhurt. An officer who went on board with a party 
to extinguish the flames of the Kingfisher, had an 
escape equally providential. Her powder room blew 
up while they were on board, and they received 
no injury. The hull drifted over to the main and her 
guns will be saved. 
</p><p>
From the enemy's keeping possession of the island 
of Cononicut, the admiral concluded that it was an 
important post to them. The battery which they had 
on the east side of it, afforded a cross fire upon the 
entrance of the harbour, and the three regiments there 
made it an object. The count therefore thought it 
expedient that we should make ourselves masters of 
it. The most effectual way of attacking it would have 
been by disembarking troops on the west side of it, 
and sending a proper force of ships up the main channel to run through the fire of the batteries at the 
entrance, and take a proper position for cutting off 
the communication between Rhode Island and Cononicut, so as to prevent the enemy's throwing across 
reinforcements ; but, upon inquiry, it was found impracticable to anchor the ships any where out of the 
reach of the enemy's batteries, so that after running 
the gauntlet at the entrance, the ships w'd have been 
exposed to a constant deliberate fire in the harbour. 
These difficulties obliged the count to renounce the 
plan of sending ships up the main channel for this 
duty. It was then inquired whether the ships might 
not effect the business by going up the western channel, turning the north point of Cononicut and coming 
down the main channel. By this means they would 
in the first instance avoid the cross fire at the en 
trance, and might take such a position relatively to 
the harbour as w'd discourage the enemy from throwing across succours. But the most experienced pilots 
</p><p>
informed us that to effect this detour, the ships must 
either have a wind which w'd answer equally for going 
up the western and coming down the main channel, 
or, that after going up with a fair wind, they would 
be obliged to beat down the main channel, or, lastly, 
they would be obliged to wait for a fair wind to bring 
them down from the north end of Cononicut. The 
delay and uncertainty incident to the first and last 
put them out of the question. The second was pronounced impracticable on account of the narrowness 
of the main channel above Newport, which w'd not 
allow scope enough for the ships work 6 , and missing stays w'd be fatal in such circumstances. 
</p><p>
It was determined therefore, that in order to gain 
Cononicut, a body of militia sh'd be applied for to 
make us equal to such a reinforcement as we thought 
the enemy could spare. Col. Fleury and myself went 
by the admiral's desire, to make application for this 
purpose. In our way we learnt that some American 
privateers had been on the island, and that the enemy 
had evacuated the battery which fired on the Sagittaire. We met <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> on his way to the fleet, 
where he was going to have a conference with the 
Admiral, and propose some changes in his plan. He 
was received on board with the guard of marines, 
and the drums beating to arms ; and, at his departure, 
the ship was manned and fifteen cannon fired. 
</p><p>
The evening of the 30th , the outermost ships made 
signals of the appearance of a fleet. The Admiral got 
his squadron in readiness for fight and chase ; but the 
fleet put about and escaped under the veil of night. 
It proved to be 8 transports with wood from Long 
Island bound to Newport, and conveyed by a frigate. 
</p><p>
On the evening of the 31'st , the Admiral sent a party 
to reconnoitre Cononicut, and discover whether the 
enemy had really abandoned all their batteries as was 
reported. It was found that they had. 
</p><p>
The next morning the Admiral landed in order to 
view the enemy's batteries from the east side of Cononicut. We found in the battery which fired on the 
Sagittaire two 24 pounders spiked, and all their heavy 
ammunition. From the battery on the E. end, we 
had a distinct view of the town shipping, and batteries. The latter lost that respectability which they 
had on paper ; the fire from the ships of the line must 
annihilate them in an hour. The fort on an eminence called Domine Hill, back of the town, may 
require our heavy artillery and some shells. We 
have every reason to believe that we shall effect our 
landing on the island without opposition, as the 
enemy seemed to have concentrated their force in Newport. 
</p><p>
The admiral has disembarrassed himself of his prisoners, sick and prizes. He is in perfect readiness for 
acting his part, and as anxious as a man can be. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a> has exerted himself to the utmost, 
but the backwardness of the militia called for from 
the neighboring states the necessity of constructing 
</p><p>
transport boats to supply the place of those destroyed 
by the enemy in their last descent, and many other 
necessary preparations which require time, have delayed us till now, and I find it impossible to tell you 
with precision on what day we shall be ready. 
</p><p>
I fear, my dearest father, that I have tired you with 
detail, and that from a habit of speaking of our operations with my finger on the map, I may in some places 
not have expressed my meaning fully enough, but my 
time unluckily will not permit to remove these inconveniences by writing a new letter. I am just come 
from the admiral to see if it will be possible by any 
means to hasten our land operations. The French 
squadron will want a great quantity of provisions 
whether they winter here or return to France. No 
biscuit is to be had here. Pennsylvania must furnish flour, and bakers should be employed there immediately. 
</p><p>
It is reported that 20 sail of Spanish ships are on 
the coast. Pray, who is Don Juan de Miralles ? 
I am ever your most affectionate 
</p><p>

</p><p>
In the letter which I wrote you from Black point, I mentioned the Admiral's intention to send his prisoners to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Some difficulties induced him 
to change his plan ; they are all landed here. 
</p><p>
Deserters from Rhode Island say the troops are 
in want of provisions, and look upon themselves as 
prisoners. 
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, with a division from the 
grand army, is arrived, and his men have had time to 
refresh themselves. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> is likewise arrived. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s 1st estimate of the enemy's land force is too high ; they cannot have above 5,000 men, and the Gen'l begins to think so himself.
