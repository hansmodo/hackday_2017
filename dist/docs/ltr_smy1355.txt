MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="friend met">Anna</a>, Yours, dated the 19th of May, was handed to me the day before yesterday by one Mr. Grove, who . . .

And now, my dear Anna, we will have done with judges and juries, courts, both 
martial and partial, and we will speak a little about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> and the fashions, 
the beaux, Congress, and the weather. Do I not make a fine jumble of them? What 
would Harper or beau Dawson say were they to know it, ha, ha, mind you laugh 
here with me. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> never was known to be so lively at this season as at 
present ; for an accurate account of the amusements, I refer you to my letter to 
your sister Mary. I went yesterday to see a doll, which has come from England, 
dressed to show us the fashions, and I saw besides a great quantity of millinery. Very    
long trains are worn, and they are festooned up with loops of bobbin, and small covered 
buttons, the same as the dress : you are not confined to any number of festoons, but put them according to your fancy, and 
you cannot conceive what a beautiful effect it has. There is also a robe which is plaited very far back, open and ruffled 
down the sides, without a train, being even with the petticoat. The hats are quite a 
different shape from what they used to be : they have no slope in the crown, scarce any rim, and are turned up at each side, 
and worn very much on the side of the head. Several of them are made of chipped wood, commonly known as cane 
hats ; they are all lined : one that has come for Mrs. Bingham is lined with white, and trimmed with broad purple ribbon, put 
round in large puffs, with a bow on the left side. The bonnets are all open on the top, through which the hair is passed, 
either up or down as you fancy, but latterly they wear it more up than down ; it is quite out of fashion to frizz or curl the 
hair, as it is worn perfectly straight. Earrings, too, are very fashionable. The waists are worn two inches longer than 
they used to be, and there is no such thing as long sleeves. They are worn half way above the elbow, either drawn or plaited in 
various ways, according to fancy ; they do not wear ruffles at all, and as for elbows, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="friend met">Anna</a>, ours would be alabaster, compared to some of the ladies who follow the fashion ; black or a colored ribbon is pinned 
round the bare arm, between the elbow and the sleeve. There have come some 
new-fashioned slippers for ladies, made of various colored kid or morocco, with small 
silver clasps sewed on ; they are very hand some, and make the feet look remarkably small and neat. Everybody thinks the 
millinery last received the most tasty seen for a long time.

All our beaux are well ; the amiable Chevalier is perfectly recovered, and handsomer than ever. I mentioned to him last 
evening that I had received a letter from you, and that you desired to be remembered to him ; he seemed much pleased at your attention, and desired that I should 
give his best love to you when I wrote ; so did Fatio and good Mr. Viar: so you see, my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="friend met">Anna</a>, I do keep my promise, 
tho you scold me so much. Mind that you write me a long answer to this, and that very soon. 
</p><p>
Your sincere and affectionate friend,
