to seek until we found. Met a man who was so ugly, I could not forget him or his sobriquet ; he was awfully in love with 
me once. He did not know me, but blushed hotly when Isabella told him who I was. He had forgotten me, I hope, or 
else I am changed by age and care past all recognition. He gave us the encouraging information that Grahamville had 
been burned to the ground.

When the call for horses was made, Mrs. McCord sent in her fine bays. She comes now with a pair of mules, and 
looks too long and significantly at my ponies. If I were not so much afraid of her, I would hint that those mules would 
be of far more use in camp than my ponies. But they will seize the ponies, no doubt.

In all my life before, the stables were far off from the house and I had nothing to do with them. Now my ponies 
are kept under an open shed next to the back piazza. Here I sit with my work, or my desk, or my book, basking in our 
Southern sun, and I watch Nat feed, curry, and rub down the horses, and then he cleans their stables as thoroughly as 
Smith does my drawing-room. I see their beds of straw comfortably laid. Nat says, " Ow, Missis, ain't lady's business to look so much in de stables." I care nothing for his grumbling, and I have never had horses in better condition. 
Poor ponies, you deserve every attention, and enough to eat. Grass does not grow under your feet. By night and 
day you are on the trot.

To-day General Chesnut was in Charleston on his way from Augusta to Savannah by rail. The telegraph is still 
working between Charleston and Savannah. Grahamville certainly is burned. There was fighting down there to-day. 
I came home with enough to think about, Heaven knows! And then all day long we compounded a pound cake in 
honor of Mrs. Cuthbert, who has things so nice at home. The cake was a success, but was it worth all that trouble ?

As my party were driving off to the concert, an omnibus rattled up. Enter Captain Leland, of General Chesnut's 
staff, of as imposing a presence as a field-marshal, handsome and gray-haired. He was here on some military errand and 
brought me a letter. He said the Yankees had been repulsed, and that down in those swamps we could give a 
good account of ourselves if our government would send men enough. With a sufficient army to meet them down 
there, they could be annihilated. " Where are the men to come from? " asked Mamie, wildly. " <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>General Hood</a> has 
gone off to Tennessee. Even if he does defeat Thomas there, what difference would that make here? "
