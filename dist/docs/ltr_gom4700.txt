Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the fifteenth. This is written merely to 
cover copies of mine to the Minister of the eleventh of March, 
twelfth and twenty-second of March, of his answer of the 
sixth Germinal, mine of the second of April, and the answer 
to it of the twenty-third Germinal, written by Buchot, a second 
Charge Provisoire of the department of Foreign Affairs. 
</p><p>
You will, perhaps, ask why my letters to the Minister are 
in French, rather than in my own language. It is not to save 
time or trouble to myself, as you will easily suppose , but 
there are two strong reasons for it. First, it cuts off one 
source of delay which, in the tediousness of transacting business at present, is important, and the more so, as the objects 
once thrown off the Minister's table upon a translator's desk, 
might run the risk of not being taken up again. Another reason, of a different complexion, is, to avoid misinterpretation 
and mistake. A slight change of idea in changing the phrases 
might have unpleasant consequences, for men are very ticklish 
in such revolutions as the present; and, therefore, it becomes 
me to be cautious, so as not to say either too much or too little ; 
and, moreover, to use an Eastern phrase, not to put my 
tongue in the mouth of another. 
</p><p>
Tn reading over the letters, of which copies are enclosed, I 
am reminded of what I wrote very long ago respecting Mr Coffyn, the agent at Dunkirk, who has expressed a wish to 
be appointed Vice Consul at that place, having heretofore 
acted in that capacity under the auspices of our Consul Geneeral, and of Dr Franklin. If I did not impose upon myself 
the obligation never to recommend to appointments, which I 
have no right to interfere in, the conduct of that gentleman, 
and his general good character, would have drawn from me a 
recommendation. As it is, I do not yet know whether my 
letter was ever received. 
</p><p>
In mine of the twenty-first of December, <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>, I mentioned 
the plan of Danton, adding that I believed that it had never 
been wholly abandoned. His late execution will show that 
faith to have been well founded. And I am now told that, 
when condemned to death, he declared that he was glad to be 
rid of a state of society so abominable. I am, &c.
