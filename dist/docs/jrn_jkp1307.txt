Exciting rumours arrived this morning from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor's</a> army. Similar rumours had been received by the southern malls for the last two or three days. If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor</a> is in any danger, as I greatly fear he is, it is in consequence of his having, in violation of his orders, advanced beyond Monterey. The truth is that from the beginning of the war he has been constantly blundering into difficulties, but has fought out of them, but at the cost of many lives. I hope in this instance he may be safe, though I greatly fear he may have had hard fighting and may have lost many of his brave men.
