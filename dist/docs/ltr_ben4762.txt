Mr. Chronicle: 
</p><p>
SIR : While the public attention is so much turned towards America, every letter from thence that promises new 
information, is pretty generally read. It seems, therefore, 
the more necessary that care should be taken to disabuse the 
public, when those letters contain facts false in themselves, 
and representations injurious to bodies of people, or even to 
private persons. 
</p><p>
In your paper, No. 310, I found an extract of a letter, said 
to be from a gentleman in General Abercrombie's army. 
As there are several strokes in it tending to render the colonies 
despicable, and even odious, to the mother country, which 
may have ill consequences, and no notice having been taken 
of the injuries contained in that letter, other letters of the same 
nature have since been published, permit me to make a few 
observations on it. 
</p><p>
The writer says: "New England was settled by Presbyterians and Independents, who took shelter there from the 
persecutions of Archbishop Laud; they still retain their 
original character; they generally hate the Church of England," says he. It is very true that if some resentment still 
remained for the hardships their fathers suffered, it might 
perhaps be not much wondered at; but the fact is, that the 
moderation of the present Church of England towards dissenters in Old as well as New England, had quite effaced those 
impressions; the dissenters, too, are become less rigid and 
scrupulous, and the good-will between those different bodies 
in that country is now both mutual and equal. 
</p><p>
He goes on: "They came out with a levelling spirit, and 
they retain it. They cannot bear to think that one man 
should be exorbitantly rich, and another poor; so that, except in the seaport towns, there are few great estates among 
them. This equality produces also a rusticity of manners; 
for their language, dress, and in all their behaviour, they are 
</p><p>
more boorish than anything you ever saw in a certain northern 
latitude." One would imagine, from this account, that those 
who were growing poor plundered those who were growing 
rich, to preserve this equality, and that property had no protection; whereas, in fact, it is nowhere more secure than in 
the New England colonies ; the law is nowhere better executed, or justice obtained at less expense. The equality he 
speaks of arises first from a more equal distribution of lands 
by the assemblies in the first settlement than has been practiced in other colonies, where favourites of governors have 
obtained enormous tracts for trifling considerations, to the 
prejudice both of the crown revenues and the public good; 
and secondly, from the nature of their occupation ; husbandmen with small tracts of land, though they may by industry 
maintain themselves and families in mediocrity, having few 
means of acquiring great wealth, especially in a young colony 
that is to be supplied with its clothing and many other expensive articles of consumption from the mother country. 
Their dress the gentleman may be a more critical judge of than 
I pretend to be ; all I know of it is, that they wear the manufacture of Britain, and follow its fashions perhaps too closely, 
every remarkable change in the mode making its appearance 
there within a few months after its invention here ; a natural 
effect of their constant intercourse with England, by ships 
arriving almost every week from the capital, their respect 
for the mother country, and admiration of every thing that 
is British. But as to their language, I must beg this gentleman's pardon, if I differ from him. His ear, accustomed 
perhaps to the dialect practiced in the certain northern 
latitude he mentions, may not be qualified to judge so nicely 
what relates to pure English. And I appeal to all English
men here, who have been acquainted with the Colonists, 
whether it is not a common remark, that they speak the language with such an exactness both of expression and accent, 
that though you may know the natives of several of the counties of England, by peculiarities in their dialect, you cannot 
by that means distinguish a North American. All the new 
books and pamphlets worth reading, that are published here, 
in a few weeks are transmitted and found there, where there 
is not a man or woman born in the country but what can read ; 
and it must, I think, be a pleasing reflection to those who 
write either for the benefit of the present age or of posterity, to find their audience increasing with the increase 
of our colonies, and their language extending itself beyond 
the narrow bounds of these islands, to a continent larger than 
all Europe, and to future empire as fully peopled, which Britain may one day probably possess in those vast western 
regions. 
</p><p>
But the gentleman makes more injurious comparisons than 
these : 
</p><p>
"That latitude," he says, "has this advantage over them, 
that it has produced sharp, acute men, fit for war or learning, 
whereas the others are remarkably simple, or silly, and blunder 
eternally. We have six thousand of their militia, which 
the general would willingly exchange for two thousand regulars. They are forever marring some one or other of our 
plans, when sent to execute them. They can, indeed, some 
of them at least, range in the woods ; but three hundred Indians with their yell throw three thousand of them in panic, 
and then they will leave nothing for the enemy to do, for they 
will shoot one another; and in the woods our regulars are 
afraid to be on a command with them on that very account." 
</p><p>
I doubt, Mr. Chronicle, that this paragraph, when it comes 
to be read in America will have no good effect; and rather 
increase that inconvenient disgust which is too apt to arise 
between the troops of different corps, or countries, who are 
obliged to serve together. Will not a New England officer 
be apt to retort and say, what foundation have you for this 
odious distinction in favour of the officers from your certain 
northern latitude ? They may, as you say, be fit for learning ; 
but, surely, that return of your first general, with a well 
appointed and sufficient force, from his expedition against 
Louisbourg, without so much as seeing the place, is not the 
most shining proof of his talents for war. And no one will 
say his plan was marred by us, for we were not with him. 
Was his successor who conducted the blundering attack, 
and inglorious retreat from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, a New England 
man, or one of that certain latitude? Then as to the comparison between regulars and provincials, will not the latter 
remark that it was two thousand New England provincials, 
with about one hundred and fifty regulars that took the strong 
fort of Beaudejour in the beginning of the war; though in the 
accounts transmitted to the English gazette, the honour was 
claimed by the regulars, and little or no notice taken of the 
others. That it was the provincials who beat General Dieskau with his regulars, Canadians, and "yelling Indians," 
and sent him prisoner to England. That it was a provincialborn officer, with American batteaux-men, that beat the 
French and Indians on Oswego River. That it was the 
same officer, with provincials, who made that long and admirable march into the enemy's country, took and destroyed 
Fort Frontenac, with the whole French fleet on the lakes, 
and struck terror into the heart of Canada. That it was a provincial officer, with provincials only, who made another 
extraordinary march into the enemy's country, surprised and 
destroyed the Indian town of Kittanning, bringing off the 
scalps of their chiefs. That one ranging captain of a few 
provincials, Rogers, has harassed the enemy more on the 
frontiers of Canada, and destroyed more of their men, than; 
the whole army of regulars. That it was the regulars who 
surrendered themselves, with the provincials under their 
command, prisoners of war, almost as soon as they were 
besieged, with the forts, fleets, and all the provisions and 
stores that had been provided and amassed to so immense 
expense at Oswego. That it was the regulars who surrendered Fort William Henry, and suffered themselves tobe butchered and scalped with arms in their hands. That 
it was the regulars under Braddock, who were thrown into 
a panic by the " yells of three or four hundred Indians,"' 
in their confusion shot one another, and, with five times the 
force of the enemy, fled before them, destroying all their own 
stores, ammunition and provisions. These regular gentlemen,, 
will the provincial rangers add, may possibly be afraid, as 
they say they are, to be on a command with us in the woods, 
but when it is considered that, from all past experience, the 
chance of our shooting them is not as one to a hundred, compared with that of their being shot by the enemy, may it 
not be suspected, that what they give as the very account 
of their fear and unwillingness to venture out with us, is only 
the very excuse; and that a concern for their scalps weighs 
more with them than a regard for their honour. 
</p><p>
Such as these, sir, I imagine may be the reflections extorted 
by such provocation from the provincials in general. But 
the New England men in particular will have reason to resent the remark on their reduction of Louisbourg. Your 
writer proceeds: "Indeed they are all very ready to make 
their boast of taking Louisbourg, in <a href='/results.php?year=1745'>1745</a> ; but if people were 
to be acquitted or condemned according to the propriety and 
wisdom of their plans and not according to their success, 
the persons that undertook the siege merited little praise; 
for I have heard officers who assisted at it say, never was 
anything more rash; for had one single part of their plan 
failed, or had the French made the fortieth part of the resistance then that they have made now, every soul of the New 
Englanders must have fallen in the trenches. The garrison 
was weak, sickly, and destitute of provisions, and disgusted, 
and therefore became a ready prey ; and, when they returned 
to France, were decimated for their gallant defence." Where 
then is the glory arising from thence? After denying his 
facts: "that the garrison was weak, wanted provisions, 
made not a fortieth part of the resistance, were decimated," 
&c., the New England men will ask this regular gentleman, 
if the place was well fortified, and had (as it really had) 
a numerous garrison, was it not at least brave to attack it 
with a handful of raw, undisciplined militia ? If the garrison 
was, as you say, "sickly, disgusted, destitute of provisions, 
and ready to become a prey," was it not prudent to seize 
the opportunity, and put the nation in possession of so important a fortress, at so small an expense? So that if you 
will not allow the enterprise to be, as we think it was, both 
brave and prudent, ought you not at least to grant it was 
either one or the other? But is there no merit on this score 
in the people, who, though at first so greatly divided, as to 
the making or forbearing the attempt, that it was carried in 
the affirmative by the small majority of one vote only; yet 
</p><p>
when it was once resolved on, unanimously prosecuted the 
design, and prepared the means with the greatest zeal and 
diligence; so that the whole equipment was completely 
ready before the season would permit the execution ? Is 
there no merit or praise in laying and executing their plan so 
well, that, as you have confessed, not a single part of it failed? 
If the plan was destitute of "propriety and wisdom," would 
it not have required the sharp, acute men of the northern 
latitude to execute it, that by supplying its deficiencies they 
might give it some chance of success? But if such "remarkably silly, simple, blundering mar plans," as you say we are, 
could execute this plan, so that not a single part of it failed, 
does it not at least show that the plan itself must be laid 
with some "wisdom and propriety"? Is there no merit in 
the ardour with which all degrees and ranks of people quitted 
their private affairs and ranged themselves under the banners of their king, for the honour, safety, and advantage of their 
country ? Is there no merit in the profound secrecy guarded 
by a whole people, so that the enemy had not the least intelligence of the design, till they saw the fleet of transports cover 
the sea before their port ? Is there none in the indefatigable 
labour the troops went through during the siege, performing 
the duty both of men and horses ; the hardship they patiently 
suffered for want of tents and other necessaries; the readiness with which they learned to move, direct, and manage 
cannon, raise batteries, and form approaches; the bravery 
with which they sustained sallies; and finally, in their consenting to stay and garrison the place after it was taken, 
absent from their business and families, till troops could be 
brought from England for that purpose, though they undertook the service on a promise of being discharged as soon as 
it was over, were unprovided for so long an absence, and 
actually suffered ten times more loss by mortal sickness 
through want of necessaries, than they suffered from the 
arms of the enemy? The nation, however, had a sense of 
this undertaking different from the unkind one of this gentleman. At the treaty of peace, the possession of Louisbourg 
was found of great advantage to our affairs in Europe; and 
if the brave men that made the acquisition for us were not 
rewarded, at least they were praised. Envy may continue 
a while to cavil and detract, but public virtue will in the end 
obtain esteem; and honest impartiality, in this and future 
ages, will not fail doing justice to merit. 
</p><p>
Your gentleman writer thus decently goes on: "The 
most substantial men of most of the provinces are children 
or grandchildren of those that came here at the king's expense that is, thieves, highwaymen, and robbers." Being 
probably a military gentleman, this, and therefore a person 
of nice honour, if any one should tell him in the plainest 
language that what he here says is an absolute falsehood, 
challenges and cutting of throats might immediately ensue. 
I shall therefore only refer to his own account in this same 
letter, of the peopling of New England, which he says with 
more truth, was by Puritans, who fled thither for shelter 
from the persecutions of Archbishop Laud. Is there not a 
wide difference between removing to a distant country to 
enjoy exercise of religion according to a man's conscience, 
and his being transported thither by law, as a punishment 
for his crimes? This contradiction we therefore leave the 
gentleman and himself to settle as well as they can between 
them. One would think from his account that the provinces 
were so many colonies from Newgate. The truth is, not only Laud's persecution, but the other public troubles in the following reigns, induced many thousand families to leave 
England and settle in the plantations. During the predominance of the Parliament many Royalists removed or were 
banished to Virginia and Barbadoes, who afterward spread 
into other settlements. The Catholics sheltered themselves 
in Maryland. At the Restoration many of the deprived 
non-conformist ministers, with their families, friends, and 
hearers, went over. Towards the end of Charles the Second's 
reign, and during James the Second's, the dissenters again 
flocked into America, driven by persecution, and dreading 
the introduction at home. Then the high price or reward 
of labour in the colonies and want of artisans there drew 
over many, as well as the occasion of commerce ; and when 
once people begin to migrate, every one has his little sphere 
of acquaintance and connections, which he draws after him 
by invitation, motives of interest, praising his new settlement, 
and other encouragements. The "most substantial men" 
are descendants of those early settlers, newcomers not having 
yet had time to raise estates. The practice of sending convicts thither is modern; and the same indolence of temper 
and habits of idleness that make people poor and tempt 
them to steal in England continue with them when they are 
sent to America, and must there have the same effects, where 
all who live well owe their subsistence to labour and business, 
and where it is a thousand times more difficult than here to 
acquire wealth without industry. Hence the instances of 
transported thieves advancing their fortunes in the colonies 
are extremely rare; if there really is a single instance of it, 
which I very much doubt ; but of their being advanced there 
to the gallows the instances are plenty. Might they not as 
well have been hanged at home ? We call Britain the mother 
country ; but what good mother would introduce thieves and 
criminals into the company of her children to corrupt and disgrace them ? And how cruel is it to force, by the high hand 
of power, a particular country of your subjects, who have not 
deserved such usage, to receive your outcasts, repealing all the 
laws they make to prevent their admission, and then reproach 
them with the detested mixture you have made! "Their 
emptying their jails into our settlements," says a writer 
of that country, "is an insult and contempt, the cruellest 
perhaps that ever one people offered to another, and would 
not be equalled even by emptying their Jakes on tables." 
</p><p>
The letter I have been considering, Mr. Chronicle, is followed by another in your paper of Tuesday, the 17th, past, 
said to be from an officer who attended Brigadier-General Forbes, in his march from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to Fort DuQuesne, 
but written probably by the same gentleman who wrote the 
former, as it seems calculated to raise the character of the 
officers of the certain northern latitude, at the expense of the 
reputation of the colonies and the provincial forces. According to this letter- writer, if the Pennsylvanians granted large 
supplies and raised a great body of troops for the last campaign, this was not on account of Mr. Pitt's zeal for the king's 
service, or even a regard for their own safety; but it was 
owing to the "general's proper management of the Quakers 
and other parties in the province." The withdrawing the 
Indians from the French interest, by negotiating a peace, is 
all ascribed to the general, and not a word said of the honour 
of the poor Quakers, who first set these negotiations on foot, 
or of honest Frederick Post, that completed them with so 
much ability and success. Even the little merit of the As
sembly's making a law to regulate carriages is imputed to 
the general's "multitude of letters." Then he tells us "innumerable scouting parties had been sent out during a long 
period, both by the general and Colonel Bouquet, towards 
Fort DuQuesne, to catch a prisoner, if possible, for intelligence, but never got any." How happened that? Why, 
"it was the provincial troops that were constantly employed 
in that service," and they, it seems, never do anything they 
are ordered to do. That, however, one would think might 
be easily remedied, by sending regulars with them, who, of 
course, must command them, and may see that they do their 
duty. No ; the regulars are afraid of being shot by the provincials in a panic. Then send all regulars. Aye ; that was 
what the colonel resolved upon. "Intelligence was now 
wanted [says the letter writer]. Col. Bouquet, whose attention to business was [only] very considerable [that is, not 
quite so great as the general's, for he was not of the northern 
latitude], was determined to send no more provincials 
a- scouting." And how did he execute his determination? 
Why, by sending "Major Grant, of the Highlanders, with 
seven hundred men, three hundred of them Highlanders, 
the rest Americans, Virginians, and Pennsylvanians." No 
blunder this in our writer, but a misfortune; and he is, 
nevertheless, one of those "acute sharp" men who are "fit 
for learning." And how did this major and seven hundred 
men succeed in catching the prisoner? Why, their "march 
to Fort DuQuesne was so conducted the surprise was complete." Perhaps you may imagine, gentle reader, that this 
was a surprise of the enemy. No such matter. They knew 
every step of his motions, and had, every man of them, left 
their fires and huts in the fields, and retired into the fort. 
</p><p>
But the major and his seven hundred men, they were surprised, first to find nobody there at night, and next to find 
themselves surrounded and cut to pieces in the morning, two 
or three hundred being killed, drowned, or taken prisoners, 
and among the latter the major himself. Those who escaped 
were also surprised at their own good fortune ; and the whole 
army was surprised at the major's bad management. Thus 
the surprise was indeed complete, but not the disgrace; for 
provincials were there to lay the blame on. The misfortune 
(we must not call it misconduct) of the major was owing, it 
seems, to an unnamed and, perhaps, unknown provincial 
officer, who, it is said, "disobeyed his orders and quitted his 
post." Whence a formal conclusion is drawn, " that a planter 
is not to be taken from the plough and made an officer on a 
day." Unhappy provincials ! If success attends where you 
are joined with the regulars, they claim all the honour, though 
not a tenth part of your number. If disgrace, it is all yours, 
though you happen to be a small part of the whole, and have 
not the command; as if regulars were in their nature invincible when not mixed with provincials, and provincials of no 
kind of value without regulars. Happy is it for you that you 
were neither present at Prestonpans nor Falkirk, at the faint 
attempt against Rochfort, the rout of St. Cas, or the hasty 
retreat from Martinico. Every thing that went wrong, or 
did not go right, would have been ascribed to you. Our 
commanders would have been saved the labour of writing 
long apologies for their conduct. It might have been sufficient to say, provincials were with us.
