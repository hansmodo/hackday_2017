BISHOP PAYNE, D.D. 
</p><p>
DEAR Sir : Allow me to donate certain valuable relics, to be exhibited for 
the benefit of Wilberforce University, where my son was educated, and whose life was sacrificed 
for liberty. These sacred relics were presented to me by Mrs. Lincoln, after the assassination of 
our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="met spouse">beloved President</a>. Learning that you were struggling to get means to complete the college 
that was burned on the day our great emancipator was assassinated, prompted me to donate, in 
trust to J. P. Ball (agent for Wilberforce College), the identical cloak and bonnet worn by 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mtl" rel="met friend">Mrs. Lincoln</a> on that eventful night. On the cloak can be seen the life-blood of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="met">Abraham Lincoln</a>. This cloak could not be purchased from 
me, though many have been the offers for it. I deemed it too sacred to sell, but donate it for 
the cause of educating the four millions of slaves liberated by our President, whose private character 
I revere. You well know that I had every chance to learn the true man, being constantly in the 
White House during his whole administration. I also donate the glove* worn on his precious 
hand at the last inaugural reception. This glove bears the marks of thousands who shook his hand 
on that last and great occasion. This, and many other relics, I hope you will receive in the name 
of the Lincoln fund. I also donate the dress worn by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mtlrel="met friend">Mrs. Lincoln</a> at the last inaugural address of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="met">President Lincoln</a>. Please receive these from Your sister in Christ, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="me">L. KECKLEY.</a>
</p><p>
* I have since concluded to retain the glove as a precious souvenir of our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="met">beloved President</a>.
