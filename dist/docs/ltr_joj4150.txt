Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I consider myself much obliged by your friendly and 
interesting letter of the 28th ult. From Talleyrand's expressions and conduct it seems, and I infer, that, he will act 
as favourably towards us as may consist with his personal 
views, for I have very little confidence in his being governed 
by any moral principles, further than they may be conveniently adopted. As to Otto and La Forest, I entertain 
of them in that respect very similar sentiments ; they 
will probably be inclined towards us as far as may suit 
them. 
</p><p>
The recent explosion at Paris has cast most of our calculations and conjectures, relative to the issue of our negotiations with the Directory, very much into the air. A 
complete state of defence at home, appears to me to be the 
only solid foundation on which to rest our hopes of security, 
and I regret that more has not been done towards it. But 
until our people become more united, and feel more sensibly 
the pride and the duties of independence, our Jacobins will 
not cease to perplex the measures of our government, 
however wise and salutary. It is pleasing to observe, that 
notwithstanding their efforts to mislead, the public mind is 
gradually recovering from its errors, and to this end your 
public reports and letters have essentially contributed. 
Your answer to the Spanish minister's factious and indecent 
letter, has made stronger impressions than he and his counsellors probably suspect. 
</p><p>
Yours, very sincerely, 
</p><p>
