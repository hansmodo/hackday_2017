Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
From the moment of my coming into office, I have sought 
opportunities for France ; in order that I might communicate 
to you the events of our country. But no direct one having 
presented itself, until the other day, when some of M. Fauchet's squadron sailed; and the stoppage of the vessel, said to 
have his despatches on board, having arrested a private letter, 
which I had written to you, you can have received only my 
public letter of the tenth of January last. 
</p><p>
The severity practised upon us by Great Britain, in her 
instructions of the 8th of June and 6th of November, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, 
has caused various movements in Congress. <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'>Mr Madison's</a> 
resolutions, of which I before informed you, were discussed 
with great vehemence ; but seem at length to be swallowed up 
in the contemplation of measures of more eclat. A proposition, dictated by the daily reports of capture and condemnation 
in the British West Indies, was made for sequestering British 
debts ; but it did not include those due from the United States 
in the shape of stock. Warm debates ensued ; when this 
motion gave way to a proposition from Mr Abraham Clark, of 
Jersey, to break up all intercourse with Great Britain, until 
we should obtain satisfaction for the wrongs, under which we 
have so long labored, in commercial and other points. You will observe by a copy of the original resolution, of the amendment, and of the Bill, every form, which it assumed in its 
passage through the House of Representatives, and its final 
defeat in the Senate. 
</p><p>
However, you will not conclude from this miscarriage, that 
it has been produced by any other cause, than the desire to 
try once more to preserve harmony by negotiation. It is now 
nearly a fortnight, since <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr Jay</a> was nominated as Envoy 
Extraordinary to London. The Senate were occupied in this 
business for some days ; objections of various kinds mingling 
to interrupt it, such as a supposed inutility of the mission, the 
sentiments of <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr Jay</a> upon matters, with which he may be 
charged, and the constitutional incompatibility or expediency 
of the Chief Justice exercising diplomatic functions. He was 
confirmed, as the extract from Brown's paper states, and will 
take ship at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in about a fortnight, or a few days 
more. The irritation, which appears in all classes of people, 
renders it probable that if he fails in his errand, the United 
States will risk all the consequences of strong measures. You 
will immediately ask, what provision has been made for revenue, and an army ? To this I must postpone my answer, 
until Congress shall have prepared it. They have before 
them plans of many sorts ; but I cannot foresee which will be 
adopted, or how efficacious any of them may be. 
</p><p>
A letter, which I received from France some time ago, intimated that you wished to return home. But I paid no respect 
to it; as you had never expressed this sentiment in the most 
distant manner, as far as I could collect from your official 
correspondence, or the knowledge of your friends. But, 
reflecting on the thing as possible, I was happy to believe, that 
your separation from France would be no great object of solicitude with you. This tribute of my own sensations is due to 
you ; because, from my acquaintance with your correspondence, 
I am free to declare, that they afford proofs of an enlightened 
and deserving Minister. 
</p><p>
During the present session of the Senate, your letters were 
called for by them. The President, after much deliberation, 
thought it right to forward such of them as related to information merely; and to withhold such others, and such parts of 
all of them, as might hazard your informant, divulge anything 
pending, or be reverberated on you to your disadvantage. 
The President, <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='co-worker met'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, and myself, went over the 
letters, under the influence of these ideas ; and, if we have 
committed to the eye of the Senate a syllable, which may not 
accord with your opinion, it has not been from the want of the 
best disposition towards you, and your character. But even 
what was sent to them, was announced to be in confidence. 
The result, I believe, was much to your reputation, in the 
opinion of the most dispassionate members; and I am very 
certain, that nothing has been moved since, with any hostile 
intention to you. Perhaps I should not go too far, if I sup 
posed, that the disclosure of the bulk of your official agency 
has suppressed many little murmurs, which we were continually hearing, before the truth of your conduct was brought to 
light. 
</p><p>
You have been assailed, however, from another quarter. 
Nothing has been ever said to any officer of our government 
by the Ministers of France, which required attention, until the 
ninth day of April last; when M. Fauchet communicated to 
me a part of his instructions, indirectly, but plainly, marking a 
wish for your recall. In a few days afterwards, a letter was 
received from the Executive Provisory Council, expressive of 
the same wish. M. Fauchet was answered by me, under the 
direction of the President, as I am sure your good sense will 
think inevitable, that what the act of reciprocity demanded, 
should be performed. I enclose a copy of my letter to him, 
that you may see the footing, upon which alone the President 
places this concession to their request. He means to pursue 
the same idea in the nomination of a successor. Perhaps 
before this letter is closed, I may be able to send you a copy 
of the nomination. 
</p><p>
In the letter of form accompanying the gentleman, who will 
replace you, it will be my study to manifest, that it is not from 
a dissatisfaction, which the President has conceived at your 
conduct, but from reasons of a different sort, irresistible in 
themselves, that. the step is taken. And I am thus explicit in 
my own opinions, because I do not distrust, that in the inquiries, which you shall make on your return, you will find, that 
at least candor and honor have been observed towards you on 
my part. I have the honor, Sir, to be with true regard and 
respect, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
