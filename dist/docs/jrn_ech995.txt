The "old man," as sea captains are universally called, has evinced a determination to make a quick passage from Valparaiso to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and since we have left the former place we have had a very strong, fair wind, and every stitch of canvas spread. During the 24 hours ending at noon yesterday we made 228 miles, being the greatest run we have made since leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, by 20 miles. At the mouth of the bay we saw a few Cape pigeons, but they did not follow us far and now not a bird is
to be seen, except a few Mother Carey's. The atmosphere is much colder than while we were in port. Last night considerable quantities of phosphoric substance were floating in our wake.

Early this morning we came within sight of the four small islands known as the St. Felix Islands, and by nine o'clock had passed within twelve or fifteen miles of them. At that distance they appeared to be nothing but barren rocks interspersed with lofty peaks and deep ravines. While near the islands, we saw a number of birds of different species, the largest of which are known as "boobies." We are now in the regular Trade Wind and it is wafting us along most beautifully.

Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Sterling's little boy, Jerome, met with a slight fall, and in the evening he was seized with a severe fit. This was the first time the like had occurred and his parents expressed much alarm. About eleven o'clock this forenoon the child died. This afternoon his body was sewed up in a piece of canvas, with three cannon balls at the feet to make it sink, and then placed on a plank with the American flag around it. A solemn prayer was said, and as the words "we now commit to the deep" were repeated by Mr. Rogers, his mortal remains were cast into the raging ocean. He was but nine months old, and of a very good, hearty constitution. This is a solemn warning to all that we know not when we may be called to that bourne from whence no traveller has yet returned. Alas! How quick the changeyesterday he was in the full enjoyment of health, happily playing round his mothertoday he's in his grave! His poor mother would do almost anything to imbue life into him again for it was in her arms he safely passed the terrors of Cape Horn, and also in her arms, in an unlucky hour, he received the
hurt which resulted in his death, for yesterday as the ship gave roll she fell with him. Here is food for reflection, and it might be well to pause, for who can tell whom the grim reaper, Death, may summon next?
