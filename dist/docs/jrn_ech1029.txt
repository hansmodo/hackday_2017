The last two days have been extremely hot during the middle part of the day, without a breath of air stirring. Saturday morning I helped my comrade, McCowan, to carry his trappings from our tent to the wagon in which he was going, and bade him a farewell grasp of the hand on his departure for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. I then started out "prospecting" with tin pan and spade on shoulder, but met with no success. Towards evening I dug a little on my lot, and never enjoyed a better night's rest than I did that night.
<p></p>
Sunday evening as we were about retiring, Mr. Speeden, in company with a friend, came to our tent and wanted to borrow our U. S. rifles to go out in pursuit of Indians. During the evening a man had come in wounded badly and almost exhausted from the loss of blood, and related a heartrending tale about his
companion whom he had left behind on Saturday about noon. They had gone out "prospecting" in company with several others and after being out some time, they agreed to separate into small parties, take different routes, and meet again on a given day and report to each other and decide which would be the best place. In the evening after building a fire and eating their supper, they lay down with their blankets around them and their rifles by their side.
<p></p>
They lay unmolested until about an hour before dawn, when they were both suddenly awakened by being shot through the legs with arrows. They immediately raised up and beheld ten Indians at a short distance, and although unable to stand, they seized their rifles and fired and two Indians fell, but whether they killed them or not they were unable to tell as they could not go to see. Many of these wild Indians fall upon the ground as if killed at the mere report of a gun. Both of the white men had been lying with the blankets over their heads and this accounts for them being shot in the legs. The Indians, it is supposed, took their feet for their heads and fired with the intention of shooting them in the bodies. They were over twenty-four hours before they succeeded in stopping the flow of blood and they fainted away several times. They were each shot through and through the legs about the knee, and they could not use them in the least. They therefore each cut a cane or staff and turning their rifles upside down made them answer for crutches. In this way they hobbled on a long time, when one of them, who was wounded worst, gave out. His companion was not for leaving him, but he begged and entreated him not to lie down and perish
with him, but to push on and save himself if he could, and if he succeeded in getting into camp to let it be known, and his friends would be out after him, and perhaps save both. After dividing their provisions they separated and the stronger one got in early last evening much fatigued and worn out. He supposed he had left his companion about eighteen miles distant.
<p></p>
This morning a company of about twenty-five, provided with arms and suitable supplies, went out in search of the lost man and in pursuit of the Indians, guided by the wounded man whose strength was so much renewed by a good night's rest and food that he was able to ride on horseback. We gave them our rifles and one hundred balls and offered our services if their party was not strong enough. This is the second attack the Indians have made upon lone parties, having captured a man about seven miles out a few days since. Indeed they are getting quite troublesome and we may well fear that the red man's swift, winged arrow, his rude tomahawk, or savage scalping knife will be the messenger of The Destroyer to many a brave heart before the season is over.

Indians have been pilfering and stealing mules for a long time in this vicinity. On one occasion three mules and a lot of flannel shirts were stolen from the lower encampment and when going to pursue, the owner found the place where they had killed and eaten the mules, leaving nothing but the skins and bones.

Our store bill was presented this forenoon for payment, the storekeeper having sold his stock and about going away. I told him I could not pay it without selling many things that I could hardly do without, and upon thus representing the matter to him he agreed to
let it stand, upon my giving my note for the amount, fifty-six dollars. I bought another beef head for $1.00. Atkins is considerably worse and still takes medicine.
