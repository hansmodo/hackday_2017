DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received last week your favor containing the quotations 
upon the subject of sequestering debts. I have not Rutherford, and know not whether it is owned in this town. But 
I have looked into Grotius, who gives the same opinion with Puffendorf as to the debt from the Thessalians to the Thebans 
which Alexander forgave. But their reasoning upon that 
case seems founded principally but not altogether upon the 
right of conquest, and admits but of a partial application to 
the propositions of the present time. There is in Grotius 
something more pointed to the state of our question. He 
says : "A king has a greater right in the goods of his subjects for the public advantage than the proprietors themselves. And when the exigencies of the state require a 
supply, every man is more obliged to contribute towards it 
than to satisfy his creditors." Grotius I. 1.6. Barbeyrac's 
note upon this passage is: "And consequently the sovereign may discharge a debtor from the obligation of paying 
either for a certain time or forever, if the public good re 
quires it." He gives an example from the Roman history 
after the battle of Cannae. 
</p><p>
These observations however seem to be confined to the 
debts due from one subject to another, and the influence of 
an act done at an epoch so calamitous cannot be cited as a 
fair precedent upon occasions when the common laws and the 
natural obligations of justice are not superseded by extreme 
necessity. 
</p><p>
That the sequestration of British debts must be considered 
as a direct act of hostility cannot I think admit of a doubt. 
But the instructions of the 6th of November were a direct 
act of hostility on their part. After the recapture of Toulon 
they did, it is true, pretend to explain them away and re 
pealed them. But in the meantime the depredations committed upon our commerce by their privateers and West 
India judges, under color of those orders, have been enormous, and such as a free and spirited people cannot tolerate. 
It is not surprising that the commercial part of the community have been so much exasperated, or that propositions so 
rash and intemperate have met with so much countenance in the national counsels. 
</p><p>
There is indeed something so fraudulent in the aspect of 
the proposals that the measure, if adopted, must be very disgraceful to the nation. It is a dishonorable resentment 
which would afford a gratification to our enemies, because 
it would make us accessary to our own infamy, the instruments of our own shame. It is a rod which can only tickle 
our adversaries, but which may be turned into a deadly 
scourge upon ourselves. It is an expedient suggested by 
our passion to our weakness, and which nothing but our 
real impotence can in any degree extenuate. Yet what 
else can we do? If they will assail us as highway robbers, 
we must pilfer from them as pickpockets. We cannot 
fight, and therefore we must cheat them. This appears to 
me to be the real state of the argument, and all that can be 
said in favor of the sequestration. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above I received your favor of the I2th. 
I have read the case to which you refer in the Collectanea Juridica, but I do not find that Magens is owned here. The 
question at that time was in many respects different from ours, and the seizure of the debt, or rather its detention by 
the King of Prussia, less warrantable than a sequestration 
would be as now proposed. His cause of complaint was in 
comparably less than ours. It does not appear that any 
violation of the laws of nations had been committed. Certainly, nothing so flagrant as the instructions of the 6th of 
November. All the condemnations had been upon the real 
grounds either of enemy's goods or contraband trade. Then 
the debt was the King s. His faith had been pledged for 
its payment. Circumstances rendered it a debt of peculiar 
and more than ordinary obligation upon him to discharge. 
All these points are dwelt upon in the report of the King of 
England's law officers, and very few of their arguments could 
now be applied against the measure on our part. 
</p><p>
I have not met with an instance of reprisals upon debts 
in the course of the present century. I am, etc.
