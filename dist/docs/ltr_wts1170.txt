Dear Brother: I had a pleasant trip to Detroit, 
reaching there in a snowstorm on Wednesday morning. 
I got a couple hours of quiet, and then for two days was 
kept on the jump, visited and dined, when I got away. 
I think I must have touched the hands of 10,000 people. 
At the dinner we had the best people of the city, who 
were even more eulogistic than usual. I saw Mr. Cass, 
who sat in a chair and was seemingly much flattered by 
my visit. He simply said that he hoped the present 
peace would not be disturbed by experiments. We cannot shove the South back as Territories, and all steps 
to that end must fail for many reasons, if no other than 
that it compels the people already there to assume a 
hostile attitude. The well disposed of the South must 
again be trusted we cannot help it.

You are classed universally as one of the rising statesmen, above mere party rules. And whilst you should 
not separate from your party, you can moderate the 
severity of their counsels. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
