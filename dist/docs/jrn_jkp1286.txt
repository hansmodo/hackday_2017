After twelve o'clock to. day when I had business with my private secretary, I learned with surprise that without giving me any notice he had gone to Annapolis on a party of pleasure. I was vexed at the occurrence, and think it so thoughtless and inexcusable on his part that I must require an explanation when he returns. In truth he is too fond of spending his time in fashionable and light society, and does not give that close and systematic attention to business which is necessary to give himself reputation and high standing in the estimation of the more solid and better part of the community. This I have observed for some months with great regret.
