SIR: 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mr. Shrewsbury, you are better acquainted with than I, therefore, I shall say no more concerning him than recommend him to 
be disposed of as you shall think .proper. If you think he can be use fully employed in his profession, you will do so; if not, he must do his 
duty as a militia man. If you approve of neither, you may either send him back to town, or do what you please with him. 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
