Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have read your letter of the 12th ult. more than once. 
Mutuality of friendly feelings always affords gratification ; 
and the kindness which pervades your letter has made its 
proper impressions. 
</p><p>
As you are in the seventy-fifth year of your age, and I in 
the seventy- fourth of mine, our leases have expired. We 
are holding over, and others will soon occupy our places. 
</p><p>
What to do, and where to go, would be perplexing questions, had not our beneficent Lessor offered us better and 
permanent habitations. 
</p><p>
The death of an excellent daughter last spring was an 
afflicting event, and I feel it. Convinced that her happiness 
was augmented by it, I had no reason to grieve on her account. I derived consolation, as well as resignation, from 
reflecting that unerring wisdom had directed that dispensation, and that I was still blessed with the surviving children, 
who (like their sister) had never given me any other uneasiness than what had arisen from their sickness or afflictions. 
</p><p>
Considering the times which have passed over us, I am 
glad you continued in office. Might not reports of some 
select cases decided in your court be useful 1 And would 
they not be more correctly prepared for the press by yourself than by others ? 
</p><p>
In my opinion, you did well to abstain from speculations. 
I thought so, and did so. It is, I believe, a just and not a 
new remark, that a proper education and proper habits, 
with a moderate share of property, form a better provision 
for a child, than that greater degree of wealth, which not 
unfrequently leads the unexperienced to idleness and its 
results. 
</p><p>
I have looked into the book which you had the goodness 
to send me, and for which I thank you. I have read the 
address, and the notices for a young farmer. They will do 
good. Although unable to attend much to my own agricultural affairs, yet books and conversation on such subjects 
entertain me. I wish I could give you a good account of 
my Tunisian sheep, but the dogs have put it out of my 
power. I regret the loss they caused ; but I regret it less 
than another loss, which more nearly affects my convenience. I allude to the death of a favourite mare, which I 
had rode for twenty- three years with great satisfaction. 
She lately died suddenly and unexpectedly, in the twentyninth year of her age. She was the third in succession, 
which died in my service. The grandam was given to me 
</p><p>
by my father in <a href='/results.php?year=1765'>1765</a>. That circumstance associated with 
various others in attaching me to them. 
</p><p>
Agricultural societies arc multiplying in this State. One 
has been formed in this county, and 1 am the nominal president ; having only the will and not the ability to render 
active services. They have prepared a representation to 
the Legislature respecting agriculture, and the expediency 
oi establishing an agricultural society for the whole State.

The traits of parsimonious and reluctant commendation 
observable in some of your British letters, give more intelligence than the writers meant to convey. As almost every 
vagrant leaf we pick up will inform us of the kind of tree 
which produced it, so these traits discover the feelings 
which originated them. It is a pity that such feelings should 
exist; but they are the offspring of human nature, which is 
not what it should be, nor what it once was. That Britons 
should reflect on our former and present state and condition, 
without regret, without mortification, and without apprehensions of rivalry and perhaps of danger, can hardly be 
expected. A doubt whether Britannia will always "rule 
the waves," cannot have a welcome reception in her mind. 
Our rapid progress in trade, navigation, and the arts, cannot 
correspond with her views and wishes. The strength 
resulting from our increasing resources and population, 
recommends a kind of policy and a degree of accommodation not congenial with the temper and propensities of such 
a nation. Superiors seldom see with complacency inferiors 
rising towards equality, and by means which may not improbably carry them beyond it. There is, nevertheless, 
great worth in Britain. 
</p><p>
I have not seen <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>'s Life. As he concurred in the opinion of Count de Vergennes, that we should proceed 
to treat for peace with Great Britain without a previous 
admission of our independence, he may, in his own mind, 
have acquitted the count of the motives to which I ascribed 
his giving us that opinion ; and also have considered his 
subsequent explanations on that and certain other topics 
as satisfactory. After mv return in <a href='/results.php?year=1784'>1784</a>, I was informed 
of the debate in Congress on the proposed resolution which 
you mention. In my opinion, <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'>Mr. Madison</a></a> voted consistently. I omit explaining this at present, for it cannot be 
done in a few words. My letter to Congress respecting 
the negotiation contained a full and correct statement of 
facts. Many years have since elapsed, but my sentiments 
relative to the policy adopted by France on that occasion 
continue unaltered. 
</p><p>
But it is time to conclude, and I will do it by thanking 
you for affording me so agreeable an occasion to assure you 
of the esteem and regard, with which I continue 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
