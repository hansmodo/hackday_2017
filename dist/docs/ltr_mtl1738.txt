</p><p>
MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : I am greatly disappointed, having only received one letter from you since 
we parted, which was dated the day after. Day after day I sent to Mrs. F. for letters. After 
your promise of writing to me every other day, I can scarcely understand it. I hope to-morrow 
will bring me a letter from you. How much I miss you cannot be expressed. I hope you have 
arrived safely in Washington, and will tell me everything. * * Was there ever such 
cruel newspaper abuse lavished upon an unoffending woman as has been showered upon my 
devoted head? The people of this ungrateful country are like the dogs in the manger ; 
will neither do anything themselves, nor allow me to improve my own condition. What a Government we have! All their abuse lavished upon 
me only lowers themselves in the estimation of all true-hearted people. The Springfield Journal 
had an editorial a few days since, with the important information that Mrs. Lincoln had 
been known to be deranged for years, and should be pitied for all her strange acts. I 
should have been all right if I had allowed them to take possession of the White House. In the 
comfortable stealings by contracts from the Government, these low creatures are allowed to hurl 
their malicious wrath at me, with no one to defend me or protect me, if I should starve. 
These people injure themselves far more than they could do me, by their lies and villany. 
Their aim is to prevent my goods being sold, or anything being done for me. In Ms, I very 
much fear, they have succeeded. 
</p><p>
Write me, my dear friend, your candid opinion about everything. I wished to be made better 
off, quite as much to improve your condition as well as for myself. * * Two weeks 
ago, dear Lizzie, we were in that den of discomfort and dirt. Now we are far asunder. Every 
other day, for the past { week, I have had a chill, brought on by excitement and suffering of mind. 
In the midst of it I have moved into my winter quarters, and am now very comfortably situated. 
My parlor and bedroom are very sweetly furnished. I am lodged in a handsome house, a very 
kind, good, quiet family, and their meals are excellent. I consider myself fortunate in all this. I 
feel assured that the Republicans, who, to cover up their own perfidy and neglect, have used every 
villanous falsehood in their power to injure me I fear they have more than succeeded, but if their 
day of reckoning does not come in this world, it will surely in the next. 
</p><p>
Saturday. I have determined to shed no more tears over all their cruel falsehoods, yet, jnst 
now, I feel almost forsaken by God and man except by the latter to be vilified. Write me all that 
Keyes and Brady think of the result. For myself, after such abuse, I expect nothing. Oh! that 
I could see you. Write me, dear Lizzie, if only a line ; I cannot understand your silence. Here 
after direct your letters to Mrs. A. Lincoln, 460 
West Washington street, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">CHICAGO</a>, 111., care of D. Cole. Remember 460. I am always so anxious 
to hear from you, I am feeling so friendless in the world. I remain always your affectionate 
friend.

[POSTSCRIPT TO LETTER OF OCT. 24.]
</p><p>
I cannot send this letter off without writing you two little incidents that have occurred within 
the past week. We may call it justice rendered for evil words,, to say the least. There is a paper 
published in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">CHICAGO</a> called the Republican, owned and published by Springfield men. Each 
morning since my return it has been thrown at my door, filled with abuse of myself. Four days 
ago a piece appeared in it, asking &lt; What right had Mrs. L. to diamonds and laces ? Yesterday 
morning an article appeared in the same paper, announcing that the day previous, at the house of 
Mr. Bunn (the owner of the paper), in Springfield, Illinois the house had been entered at 11 
in the morning, by burglars, and had been robbed of Five diamond rings, and a quantity of fine laces. 
This morning's paper announces the recovery of these articles. Mr. Bunn, who made his hundreds 
of thousands off our government, is running this paper, and denouncing the wife of the man from 
whom he obtained his means. I enclose you the article about the recovery of the goods. A few 
years ago he had a small grocery in S . 
</p><p>
These facts can be authenticated. Another case in point : The evening I left my house to come 
here, the young daughter of one of my neighbors in the same block, was in a house not a square off, 
and in a childish manner was regretting that I could not retain my house. The man in the 
house said : i Why waste your tears and regrets on Mrs. Lincoln ? An hour afterward the husband and wife went out to make a call, doubtless 
to gossip about me ; on their return they found their young boy had almost blinded himself with - 
gunpowder. Who will say that the cry of the 1 widow and fatherless is disregarded in His 
sight! If man is not merciful, God will be in his own time.
