Today at twelve o'clock we were in lattitude 0° 18'

North, so we must have crossed the line about nine o'clock. This is the fourth time that I have crossed the Equator and although I have kept a sharp look out I never have seen anything like a line, so you may set it down that it is an imaginary line. We are in 146° 6' W. longitude. Overhaul your Atlas and when found stick in a pin.
