<p>
TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
SIR: <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, November 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
The opinion that a general peace will take place before the 
opening of the spring is still very prevalent, though I do not find any one who professes to believe it. The idea appears 
to be only founded upon the absolute necessity which is supposed to exist on the part of the combined powers to finish the war. 
</p><p>
With respect to this country, the letters which I have done myself the honor to write you since my arrival here will 
serve to shew the hopeless condition of the allies. I might perhaps spare you the trouble of reading an annoying detail 
of French success, which in all human probability must still continue, until their own moderation shall dictate the terms 
of their retreat, or the perseverance of their enemies to maintain an impracticable opposition shall plant the standard of the French Republic upon the walls of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. 
</p><p>
Britain, however, yet adheres inflexibly to the continuance of the war, and this determination fully coincides with 
the wishes of the Patriotic party here. This extraordinary concurrence is no doubt extremely embarrassing to the 
government of the United Provinces, nor is it easy to conceive how they will extricate themselves from this critical 
predicament. A continuance of the war they have reason 
to expect will terminate in their utter destruction. A 
separate peace with France would no doubt be humiliating 
to them in the extreme, but it might at least serve to pro 
long their existence, and it is to be remarked that the 
declaration in favor of this measure originated first in Zeeland, the Province where the power of the Stadtholder 
is the most extensive and his influence the most universal. 
</p><p>
The Patriots are very sanguine in the expectation that 
France will make common cause with them, and will not 
treat at all without the total expulsion of the Stadtholder. But I confess I do not see at present upon what foundation 
their expectation stands. If there were any concert between them, it would necessarily be kept profoundly secret, and 
it is therefore impossible to say that none actually exists. I can only observe that I have not discovered anything upon 
which a probability of such a circumstance can be raised, and all the public appearances are against it. 
</p><p>
France lately renewed the declaration, that she will not interfere in the internal affairs of any other country. She 
makes no distinction between the different partisans in the places which have capitulated, nor does any particular 
animosity against the House of Orange appear at present, either in her public councils, or in her armies. So that a 
peace between the French Republic and the present States General does not appear to me to be an impossible event. 
</p><p>
It is now said that the Duke of Brunswick has positively refused the command of the allied army, or rather, that he 
annexed such conditions to his acceptance as could not be complied with. The dissatisfaction between the people of 
this country and their English allies continually increases. The complaints against the Commander-in-Chief become 
more and more grievous from day to day. The nature of them will be fully explained to you by the bearer of this letter. 
</p><p>
The intelligence of every kind relating to the war is only 
to be gleaned from the private letters which arrive from the 
invaded country. The Duke of York's defeat of the 19th of last month, an account of which I wrote you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, 
was not publicly known at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> on my arrival there. 
Every unfavorable event is suppressed as much as possible, 
and the printers of public newspapers are suspended in 
their employments for weeks and months together for publishing simple facts, which happen to be disagreeable at 
Court. The liberty of the press and, indeed, every other 
species of liberty, are circumscribed within very narrow limits. Every traveller, as soon as he alights at an inn, 
must declare in writing his name, his occupation, his place 
of abode, whence he comes, where he is going, how long he 
means to stay, and by whom he is known in this country. 
General Eustace was arrested and had his papers seized, 
because he was accidentally detained here a day or two 
longer than he had thus signified his intention to remain. 
The meeting of the British Parliament is to be next week, 
and it is expected with much solicitude by the political 
speculators. The Portuguese Minister at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, 
happening to be here on a visit, as well as myself, and 
lodging at the same house, called on me last evening. It is 
hardly possible for a conversation at this time to turn upon 
any other subject than the prospect of peace. He said he 
did not see how it could take place, as long as England should 
hold out. France had reconquered all her West India 
Islands in Flanders, and she would not certainly restore her 
conquests unless her own possessions should be restored 
to her. Without the consent of England there could be no 
return to the status quo, and England was not yet reduced to 
the necessity of resigning her acquisitions. The King has 
lately accepted the sovereignty of Corsica, which this 
gentleman considers as a very important accession to the 
British dominions, as facilitating very much their views for 
the extension of their trade in the Levant, by giving them 
a convenient port in the Mediterranean. This will be 
another motive for the obstinacy of Britain to persist in the 
war, and if she should become the sole combatant of France 
she could wage the war, which in that case would become 
exclusively maritime, much more advantageously and with 
better prospect of success than she does at present. 
</p><p>
Speaking of the cause of complaint given by that power 
to the neutral nations, I observed that the system in which 
it originated was somewhat extraordinary. I found his 
ideas upon the subject perfectly coincided with ours. "A 
single town besieged/ said he, "may be reduced by famine. 
The means may be within the power of the besiegers. The 
operation is of partial effect. The inhabitants in general 
suffer only the inconvenience of hunger, and the place 
surrenders. But to pretend and attempt to starve twenty-four millions of people, to cut off all the means of subsistence from a country situated like France, independent of 
the moral complexion of such a design upon which there 
is nothing to be said, it was merely on the point of practicability a thing altogether new. He believed such a 
design was never formed before, and on the score of policy 
it was certainly the method to unite the whole force of 
every individual in France against the allies, and to give 
the national power an energy which nothing else could do 
so effectually." 
</p><p>
That plan is received almost universally in the same 
light, and as Mr. Araujo says it is the first attempt of the 
kind, so I think it will not very soon be again renewed. I 
think however that precedents of this kind may be found in 
the annals of British policy, and we were during the American 
war indebted to them for a similar intention. 
</p><p>
I this moment hear that an agreement for a temporary 
cessation of hostilities until further order has been agreed 
on by the officers of the contending armies on this and the 
other side of the Waal. This is considered as a prelimi 
nary to winter quarters, to be taken on both sides, of which 
however I very much doubt. The weather grows cold, and 
a severe season is expected by everybody, though I know 
not exactly why. The Stadtholderians tell us, it will be 
favorable to them, as the French armies cannot keep the 
field with hard weather in this climate in winter. The 
Patriots say that the cold will only shut up the canals, 
defeat the benefit of an inundation, and make the best 
possible road for the French troops to march into Amster 
dam. We shall soon see what foundation there is for all 
or either of these opinions. I am, etc.
