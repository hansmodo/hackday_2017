</p><p>
Dear Brother: The pressure of official duties here 
prevented my writing sooner, but I have kept a watchful 
eye on all your movements recently. 
</p><p>
I have not the slightest hesitation in justifying every 
movement you have made. The newspapers are generally down on you and will command the public attention to your prejudice, but intelligent persons do not fail 
to notice that not a specific allegation is made against 
you._, The authorities sustain your actions throughout. 
This is especially so as to the Secretary of War. I read 
your official report, and was very anxious to have it 
published. It would correct many errors and would be 
a complete justification and explanation of many things 
not understood. 
</p><p>
I asked <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Gen. Halleck</a> to allow me to publish it. He 
declined, unless the Secretary of War consented, and said 
he would submit my application to the Secretary. Afterwards I saw the Secretary, and he told me he had directed 
a copy of the report to be furnished for publication. 
I again called at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a>'s, and saw Gen. Cullum, who 
objected to the publication of the report on various 
grounds. 
</p><p>
After a full conversation with Cullum, I supposed I 
had satisfied him that it ought to be published, and he 
agreed to submit my reasons to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> and ask a 
reconsideration. This morning I received a note from 
Halleck stating that, as further operations would occur 
before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, he did not deem it advisable to publish 
the report at present. Thus the matter ends. Cullum 
stated to me that there was no officer of the army who 
did not entirely justify your attack on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> under 
the circumstances as you supposed them to be. In the 
end you will be justified in public opinion.': 
</p><p>
Military affairs look dark here in the army of the 
Potomac. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside</a> is relieved and Hooker is in command. The entire army seems demoralized. Perhaps 
when it is ready to move it may be all right. A certain amount of dissatisfaction always will exist in an 
army. I was very glad to notice that you were popular 
with and had the confidence of your men. This is the 
case with but few officers. I deeply pity Porter. 1 . . . 
</p><p>
If we recover from the folly of legislators and the 
quarrels of our generals, it will be evidence of vitality, 
remarkable in the history of any nation. I believe we 
shall survive all these dangers, and I agree with you that 
no course is left for us but to fight it out. I cannot 
respect some of the constituted authorities, yet I will 
cordially support and aid them while they are authorized 
to administer the government. Pray write me as often as you can. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jos" rel="me">John Sherman</a>.
