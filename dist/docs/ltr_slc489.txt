[Editor's note: On the 23d of July General Grant died.  Immediately there was a newspaper discussion as to the most
suitable place for the great chieftain to lie.  Mark Twain's
contribution to this debate, though in the form of an open letter,
seems worthy of preservation here.]</i>

       To the New York "Sun," on the proper place for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant's</a> Tomb:
</p><p>
To THE EDITOR OP' THE SUN:--SIR,--The newspaper atmosphere is charged
with objections to New York as a place of sepulchre for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a>,
and the objectors are strenuous that Washington is the right place.  They
offer good reasons--good temporary reasons--for both of these positions.
</p><p>
But it seems to me that temporary reasons are not mete for the occasion.
We need to consider posterity rather than our own generation.  We should
select a grave which will not merely be in the right place now, but will
still be in the right place 500 years from now.
</p><p>
How does Washington promise as to that?  You have only to hit it in one
place to kill it.  Some day the west will be numerically strong enough to
move the seat of government; her past attempts are a fair warning that
when the day comes she will do it.  Then the city of Washington will lose
its consequence and pass out of the public view and public talk.  It is
quite within the possibilities that, a century hence, people would wonder
and say, "How did your predecessors come to bury their great dead in this
deserted place?"
</p><p>
But as long as American civilisation lasts New York will last.  I cannot
but think she has been well and wisely chosen as the guardian of a grave
which is destined to become almost the most conspicuous in the world's
history.  Twenty centuries from now New York will still be New York,
still a vast city, and the most notable object in it will still be the
tomb and monument of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a>.
</p><p>
I observe that the common and strongest objection to New York is that she
is not "national ground."  Let us give ourselves no uneasiness about
that.  Wherever General Grant's body lies, that is national ground.
