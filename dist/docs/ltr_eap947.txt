My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--To say I am much obliged to you for your affectionate and welcome letter would be useless.
</p><p>
You know it could not be otherwise. Sympathy and friendship such as yours, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, can compensate for many a lonely hour. When I read your letter, I felt as if I could hardly wait for the time to come when I should be able to tell you how highly I prize your friendship, and of the many changes that have taken place since you left. Could I seat myself by your side but for one hour, how much I could tell you that my sheet will not contain. My disposition is naturally cheerful and I am disposed to look on the bright side of everything, yet for all this, sadness will steal into my heart which requires a strong effort to conceal, when I think of the privations and hardships you have to endure. I am enjoying good health which is the greatest blessing we can have.

You spoke of the pleasant moonlight nights and thought perhaps I might be looking upon the moon at the same time. I have had precisely the same thoughts and feelings so I think there must have been some magnetic influence across the pathless ocean.
</p><p>
I presume by this time you have received my letter directed to San Francisco, California.

Mr. Harrison and his daughter and Miss Leslie from Barnum's museum held two concerts here in the Cabinet. And a new set of musicians called the Bell Ringers gave two entertainments. The Balls for the season have ended.

There has been a great revival in the Baptist Church. Numbers of persons have joined and I hope they will be sincere and make no false pretensions.

Mr. Hall, the watchmaker and jeweler, was robbed about the first of January. The moon shone brightly. Not a cloud was to be seen. Mr. Hall was sleeping soundly in the second story of his house. It seems as
if fortune favors robbers sometimes. That night for the first time in his life, he forgot his fireproof key and left it lying on the top of the fireproof, where his most valuable articles were kept. No tidings of the articles or robbers have yet been heard.

We received a letter from Theodore dated the 23d of October. He was then at Weaver's Creek digging gold. But he said they had not been very successful. They had laboured ten days for twenty dollars. Mr. Dixon was very much discouraged, and anxious to return home. Many are still going to California in every vessel. But many persons have told me that only one out of every ten that goes to dig gold makes anything. So if you should not be among the fortunate, be not discouraged but return to those who devoutly love you in good old West Chester and let well enough alone. I think a person would require an iron constitution to stand the climate and privations that you must encounter out there.
</p><p>
Last night I had a delightful dream. I dreamt that you had returned home. You had better believe there was a sad heart made happy. I hope my dream will soon be realized.
</p><p>
I do not know when I shall ever be able to repay Mr. Prizer for his kindness. He has taken me to several places of amusement and has taken me to church frequently. For all this I am indebted to you.
</p><p>
Yours truly and sincerely,
</p><p>
