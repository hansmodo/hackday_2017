Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you on the twenty-seventh of December, but there 
were many things which I did not write, and some of them I 
will now communicate. At the close of the session of the first 
National Assembly, a coalition was brought about between the 
Jacobins and the Quatre-vingt-neufs. It is proper to explain 
these terms. The Jacobins, so called from their meeting at a 
convent or church of that name, were then the violent party. 
The others, who took their name from a club instituted in the 
year <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, were those who termed themselves moderate men, 
friends to order, &c. &c. The death of Mirabeau, (who was 
beyond all controversy one of the most unprincipled scoundrels 
that ever lived,) left a great chasm in the latter party. He 
was then sold to the court, and meant to bring back absolute 
authority. 
</p><p>
The chiefs of the Jacobins were violent, for two reasons. 
First, that the Quatre-vingt-neufs would not join with them 
seriously and heartily, wherefore not being able to make head 
alone, they were obliged to use the populace, and therefore to 
sacrifice to the populace. Secondly, that the objects of their 
desire were much greater, though more remote, than those of the 
other party ; for these last had never sought in the revolution 
anything else, than to place themselves comfortably, whereas 
the Jacobins did really at first desire to establish a free constitution, in the expectation that sooner or later they should be 
at the head of it. 
</p><p>
The Aristocrats, you will observe, were reduced to insignificancy before the others divided. That, you know, is a 
thing of course. You will remember, that the first Assembly 
had decreed that their members could neither hold any office 
under the crown, nor yet be chosen to represent the people. 
These decrees were partly the fruit of opposition between the 
two parties, and partly the result of suspicions, which they had 
both excited amongst the well meaning members of the Assembly. The first decree was of Jacobin parentage, to disappoint 
their enemies, who were upon the point of succeeding to office. 
The second decree was carried against the secret inclinations 
of both. But the consequence was, that each was seriously 
disappointed ; and as the constitution was clearly unable to 
support itself, they began to perceive that its ruin might involve 
their own, and therefore they formed a coalition, in which 
each determined to make use of the other for its own purposes. 
</p><p>
But you will say perhaps, that both together would be of little use ; and this is true in a degree ; for if the constitution 
had been a practicable thing, those alone who were in power 
under it could have any real authority. But that was not the 
case, and therefore the plan of the Allies was to induce a be 
lief in the court, that they alone had sufficient popularity in the 
nation to preserve the monarchical authority against the republican party, and on the other hand to convince the Assembly, 
that (having in their hands the royal authority) all favor, offices, 
and grants must come through them. Thus they constituted 
themselves, if I may be allowed the expression, the government brokers of the nation. 
</p><p>
I have mentioned the republican party. This naturally 
grew up out of the old Jacobin sect ; for when the chiefs, finding that all was nearly ruined by the want of authority, had 
set themselves seriously at work to correct their own errors, 
many of their disciples, who believed what their apostles had 
preached, and many who saw in the establishment of order the 
loss of their consequence, determined to throw off all submission to crowned heads, as being unworthy of a free people. 
Add to this the number of { moody beggars starving for a 
time of pell-mell havock and confusion. 
</p><p>
It was this coalition, which prevented the King from accepting the constitution in a manly manner, pointing out its capital 
faults, marking the probable consequences, calling on them to 
reconsider it, and declaring that his submission to their decisions arose from his belief, that it was the only means to avoid 
the horrors of civil war. They saw that this conduct would 
render them responsible, and although it was the most likely 
means of obtaining a good constitution at a future day, and would 
have bound the King down to the principles he should then ad 
vance, yet they opposed, because such good constitution would 
be established, not only without, but even against them, and 
would of course deprive them of those objects which they were 
in pursuit of. The King contended strongly for that kind of 
acceptance, which I have just mentioned, but he was borne 
down, being threatened with popular commotions fatal to him self and his family, and with that civil war which he most wished to avoid, as the necessary result of such fatal commotions. 
</p><p>
Shortly after his acceptance it became necessary to appoint 
another minister of Foreign Affairs, Monsieur de Montmorin 
having insisted so strongly on retiring that the King could not 
longer, with any propriety, ask him to stay. The state of the 
ministry was then as follows. Monsieur Duport, the Keeper of 
the Seals, a creature of and sworn adherent to the Triumvirate ; 
which Triumvirate is another Duport, Barnave, and Alexander 
Lameth, being the chiefs of the old Jacobins. I say the old 
Jacobins, for the present Jacobins are the republican party. 
This Keeper of the Seals constantly communicated every 
thing that passed in council to his coadjutors. The Minister of 
the Interior, Monsieur Delessart, was a wavering creature, one 
of those of whom Shakspeare says that they renege, affirm, and 
turn their halcyon beaks with every gale and vary of their 
masters. He had been one of M. Necker's underlings, was 
brought forward by him, and had connected himself with the 
Triumvirate, M. Necker's enemies, as being the strongest party, 
but still kept up a good understanding with the others. 
</p><p>
Duportail, the Minister at War, of whom I formerly spoke to 
you when he was appointed, and foretold the conduct he would 
pursue towards his creator, <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, was also 
completely subservient to the Triumvirate. But at that time he 
was so much embroiled with the Assembly, that his speedy resignation seemed unavoidable. Monsieur Bertrand de Molleville 
had just been appointed to the Marine, an office which Monsieur 
de Bougainville had refused to accept. He was pushed to it by 
the Quatre-vingt-neufs, whom he despised, and told the King 
that he would not be member of a ministry, many of whom he 
knew to be unfaithful to him. Monsieur Bertrand was brought 
forward by the same influence, but he is really attached to the 
crown, wishes ardently to obtain a good constitution for his 
country, is an intelligent, sensible, and laborious man, formerly 
of the robe, and the particular friend of Monsieur de Montmorin. 
</p><p>
I mentioned to you formerly that Monsieur de Choiseul had 
refused the office of Foreign Affairs. While it was in question who should be appointed to succeed Monsieur de Montmorin, 
the King of his own head named the Count de Moustier, and 
wrote him a letter on the subject, which de Moustier has since 
shown to me. He had the prudence to write from Berlin to 
decline accepting, until after he should be in Paris. When he 
arrived in that city the King told him that he could not give 
him the office, because he was considered as an Aristocrat. 
You will observe that the coalition had been at work to get rid 
of him, and here I must make a digression. The plan was 
that as soon as circumstances would permit, a Minister at War 
should be appointed, faithful to the King, and then Bougainville take the Marine, Bertrand be appointed Keeper of the 
Seals, and Delessart either kept in or turned out, as he should 
behave. This plan was not known to the coalition at all, but 
they well knew that if de Moustier got into place, it would be 
a step towards the destruction of their influence and authority. They therefore assured the King, that they could not answer for consequences, threatened him with popular commotions, with opposition in the Assembly, and the like, so that at 
last he gave up his nomination and explained the matter to de Moustier. A long interregnum ensued in that office, and as 
Monsieur de Montmorin absolutely refused to continue any longer, the Portefeuille was given to Monsieur Delessart, and 
after some time the Count de Segur was appointed. 
</p><p>
He accepted in the belief of two things, in both of which he 
was mistaken. One, that he had the confidence of the King 
and Queen ; but he had never taken the right way to obtain 
either their confidence, or that of others. The second article 
of his creed was, that the Triumvirate (his patrons) commanded a majority in the Assembly. He was undeceived as to the 
latter point immediately, and therefore threw up the office and 
went out of town. Under these circumstances Monsieur de 
Narbonne tried hard to obtain that place, and, as I have mentioned his name, and that of Monsieur de Choiseul, I will in 
this place mention that of the Abbe de Perigord, afterwards 
Bishop of Autun. These three are young men of high family, men of wit and men of pleasure ; the two former were 
men of fortune, but had spent it. They were intimates ; all 
three had run the career of ambition together to retrieve 
their affairs. On the score of morals neither of them is 
exemplary. The Bishop is particularly blamed on that head, 
for the variety and publicity of his amours, for gambling, and 
above all for stock-jobbing during the ministry of Monsieur de Calonne, with whom he was on the best terms, and therefore 
had opportunities which his enemies say he made no small use 
of. However I do not believe in this, and I think that except 
his gallantries, and a mode of thinking rather too liberal for a 
churchman, the charges are unduly aggravated. 
</p><p>
It was by the Bishop's intrigues principally, that Monsieur 
de Choiseul was formerly nominated to the office of Foreign 
Affairs, but he preferred staying at Constantinople till he 
could see which way things would settle, and to that effect he 
prevailed on the Vizier, or rather the Rei-s Effendi, to write that 
he thought it much for the interest of France, that he should 
stay for three years longer in that city. In the beginning of 
the revolution, Narbonne, a great Jlnti-neckerist, was not a 
little opposed to it, and there was afterwards some coldness 
between him and the Bishop, partly on political accounts, and 
partly because he (in common with the rest of the world) 
believed the Bishop to be too well with his mistress. This 
coldness was however at length removed by the interference 
of their common friend, and the Bishop labored hard to get 
his friend de Narbonne appointed to the office of Foreign 
Affairs, but the King would not agree to it. M. Delessart 
was therefore appointed, he being very glad to get rid of the 
department of the Interior, where he had everything to apprehend from want of power, want of order, and want of 
bread. The next step was to bring Monsieur de Narbonne 
forward to fill the place of Monsieur Duportail, and to this 
M. Delessart gave his hearty assistance by way of compensating for the disappointment in the other department. Finally the Interior, or Home Department, was filled by a Monsieur 
Cahier de Gerville, of whom I know very little ; nor is it 
necessary that I should. 
This ministry stands then divided as follows. The Keeper 
of Seals and M. Delessart are attached, or supposed to be so, 
to the Lameth faction, Monsieur de Narbonne and Monsieur 
Bertrand are supposed to be attached to the Quatre-vingtneufs, and M. de Gerville rather leaning to the latter. This 
ministry, extremely disjointed in itself, and strongly opposed 
by the Assembly, possesses on the whole but a moderate share 
of talents, for though Count de Narbonne is a man of wit, and a 
very pleasant lively fellow, he is by no means a man of 
business ; and though M. Bertrand has talents, yet according 
to the old proverb, one swallow never makes a summer. 
</p><p>
Such as it is, every one of them is convinced that the constitution is good for nothing ; and unfortunately they are. many 
of them so indiscreet as to disclose that opinion,. when at the 
same time they declare their determination to support and execute it, which is in fact the only rational mode, which now 
remains, of pointing out its defects. It is unnecessary to tell 
you, that some members of the National Assembly are in the 
pay of England, for that you will easily suppose. Brissotde Warville is said to be one of them, and indeed, (whether from 
corrupt or other motives I know not,) his conduct tends to injure his own country, and benefit that of their ancient foes in a 
very eminent degree. 
</p><p>
The situation of their finances is such, that every considerate 
person sees the impossibility of going on in the present way ; 
and as a change of system, after so many pompous declamations, is not a little dangerous among a people so wild and ungoverned, it has appeared to them that a war would furnish 
some plausible pretext for measures of a very decisive nature, 
in which state necessity will be urged in the teeth of policy, 
humanity, and justice. Others consider war as the means of 
obtaining for the government the eventual command of disciplined military force, which may be used to restore order, in 
other words to bring back despotism ; and then they expect 
that the King will give the nation a constitution, which they 
have neither the wisdom to form nor the virtue to adopt for 
themselves. Others again suppose that in case of a war there 
will be such a leaning from the King towards his brothers, from 
the Queen towards the Emperor, from the nobility (the very 
few) who remain towards the mass of their brethren, who have 
left the kingdom, that the bad success natural to arise from 
the opposition of undisciplined mobs to regular armies, may be 
easily imputed to treasonable counsels, and the people be prevailed on to banish them altogether, and set up a federal re 
public. Lastly, the Aristocrats burning with the lust of vengeance, most of them poor, and all of them proud, hope that, 
supported by foreign armies, they shall be able to return 
victorious and re-establish that species of despotism most suited 
to their own cupidity.
</p><p>
It happens, therefore, that the whole nation, though with different views, are desirous of war, for it is proper in such general statement to take in the spirit of the country, which has ever 
been warlike. I have told you long ago, that the Emperor is 
by no means an enterprising or warlike prince. I must now, 
in confirmation of that, inform you that in the famous conference at Pilnitz he was taken in by the King of Prussia, for he 
came prepared to higgle about the nature and extent of the 
succor to be given and forces to be employed ; but the King 
cut the matter short by telling him, that the difference in the 
extent of their respective dominions, and a variety of other 
circumstances, would justify him in demanding greater efforts 
on the part of the Emperor, but that he would meet him on 
ground of perfect equality. In consequence of this the Emperor was obliged to accede, but he did so in the view and the 
wish to do nothing. 
</p><p>
When therefore the King accepted the constitution, he chose 
to consider that as a reason why foreign Princes should not 
interfere. The King cf Prussia, however, gave to the King personal assurances of his good will, and brotherly attachment, and 
of this offered substantial proofs. The King's true interest 
(and he thinks so) seems to consist in preserving the peace, 
and leaving the Assembly to act as they may think proper, which will demonstrate the necessity of restoring in a great degree the 
royal authority. The faction opposed to him are very sensible 
of this, which forms an additional reason for driving everything 
to extremity ; and therefore with a view to destroy every root 
and fibre of ancient systems, they have imagined to court the 
alliance of Great Britain and of Prussia. In consequence, the 
Bishop d Autun has been sent to England, and if my information be good, is authorised to propose the cession of the Islands 
of France and Bourbon and the island of Tobago, as the price 
of an alliance against the Emperor. 
</p><p>
This has a direct tendency to break the family compact with 
Spain, which has long been courted by Britain ; for it is evi 
dent, that this country will not embark in a contest which is to 
do France any good, and therefore the game of Mr Pitt is as 
clear as the sun, and suits exactly his temper and disposition. 
He has only to receive the offers made, and send copies to 
Vienna and Madrid, by way of supporting his negotiations, particularly with the latter. He can offer them also the guarantee 
of their dominions and rights against us, and by this means we 
should find ourselves all at once surrounded by hostile nations. 
The minister of the Marine opposed violently in council this 
mission, stated the consequences, and obtained some useful restrictions. M. de Warville proposed in the Diplomatic Commit 
tee the cession of Dunkirk and Calais to England, as pledges 
of the fidelity of France to the engagements she might take. 
You will judge from this specimen of the wisdom and virtue 
of the faction to which he belongs, and I am sure the integrity of your heart will frown with indignant contempt when 
I tell you, that among the chiefs of that faction are men, who 
owe their all to the personal bounty of the King. 
</p><p>
This mission of the Bishop d Autun has produced something 
like a schism in the coalition. The party of Lameth and Barnave are strongly opposed to it. Monsieur Delessart, who 
had adopted the scheme on the representation of the Bishop 
(with whom it originated) and his friends, abandoned it on the 
representation of the others, and two days before I left Paris 
an express was sent to assure the Emperor, that notwithstanding appearances they meant him no harm. In effect they 
were again going to endeavor at an alliance of the nation with 
him, upon a plan which was set on foot about three months 
ago by those, who afterwards fell into the plan of an alliance 
with Britain. You may judge from hence how much dependence is to be placed on these new fangled statesmen. The 
King and Queen are wounded to the soul by these rash measures. They have, I believe, given all needful assurances to 
the Emperor and King of Spain. A confidential person has 
desired me to assure you on their behalf, that they are very 
far from wishing to change the system of French politics and 
abandon their old allies, and therefore if any advantage is taken of the present advances to Britain, that you will consider 
them as originating merely in the madness of the moment ; and 
not as proceeding from them, or as meeting with their approbation, but the contrary. I shall send this letter in such a way, as 
promises the greatest safety, and I must entreat you, my dear 
Sir, to destroy it for fear of accidents ; you will feel how important it is to them, that this communication be not disclosed. It 
is merely personal from them to you, and expressive of sentiments which can have no action until they have some authority. 
</p><p>
It is time to close this too long letter, whose object is to possess you of that interior machinery by which outward movements are directed. Believe always, I pray, in the sincerity of 
those sentiments with which I am yours,
