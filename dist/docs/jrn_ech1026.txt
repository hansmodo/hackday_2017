Being stiffened and disabled by the poison for four days, I could not work much but the poison is gradually disappearing and I am again able to move around quietly. I have done little but wash my clothes, which is always an unpleasant piece of work. McCowan did nothing but his washing either.

Friday the sky was overcast with dark clouds. During the night it didn't rain but poured down in torrents, threatening to drown us out of our tent, and wetting part of our clothing. Mr. Cox's tent was nearly blown down several times during the night and he had to sit up to prevent such a catastrophe. The rain commenced again Saturday evening and has continued with but slight interruption ever since. It has rendered the ground very soft and raised the river considerably, making it still more difficult to work upon the bars. In fact very few are at work as they can do nothing on account of the water coming in upon them faster than it can be pumped out. This is the reason we have been so tardy and done so little upon our claims. It will yet require some time for the water to get low enough to work with any advantage, and in the meantime we intend to prospect around in the hope of finding some rich gulch or ravine. This evening the clouds disappeared and the heavens are thickly studded with brilliant stars.

Sunday was quite dull and time hung heavily. I read my Bible and snoozed away in the land of dreams part of the time. Atkins has taken a relapse and is considerably worse again. McCowan also is not as well as he was a few days since, and is now quite disgusted, with Mariposa in particular and the gold mines in general. He is determined to leave as soon as possible and endeavor to get a berth at his trade, blacksmithing. But
as we are now considerably in debt there is no telling how soon any of us can leave.

We have several different varieties of the feathered tribe here that are not found at home, and among them is the magpie, somewhat larger than our blue jay but like him in his form and actions; and the large, jet black raven, somewhat larger than our common crow. Numbers of partridges are seen nearly every day within a hundred yards of our tent; and almost all kinds of game, from the little burrowing prairie squirrel to the huge and fierce grizzly bear, abound within twenty miles of us either in the valleys along streams or on the borders of the snow crest Sierra Nevada.

I practised a little this morning at target firing with my rifle. I sold a large bowie knife for five dollars, cost four in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>; and bought a sack of flour, 100 pounds, on credit for thirty-five dollars.
