SAN FRANCISCO, December 5th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>.

We came up the coast on the steamer Orizaba, having left Los Angeles on thanksgiving day. The sea was rough, and soon after stepping on board, we concluded to defer eating our thanksgiving dinner till next year. We tried to take it easy, but felt very uneasy, and, in all we had to say and do, manifested a critical taste, decidedly squeamish. In fact, we were in a critical mood--moodish--and remained so for nearly three days, when we lifted up our eyes and beheld the Golden Gate, the gate of deliverance, feeling truly thankful that there is such a thing as dry land.

On the way I took but few notes, and saw but little worth noting. A screaming flock of seagulls, a shark and a brigade of porpoises followed the ship during the entire voyage. We amused ourselves in looking over the taffrail at the gliding porpoises, and in flinging fragments of food
overboard to the seagulls, who would descend like a flock of hungry chickens, and seize, in a moment, the floating morsels.

The line of the coast, for nearly the whole distance of four hundred miles, is abrupt, chalky and barren. It has neither grass, nor tree of any kind growing upon it. It is bordered by a range of hills and broken mountains, which subside, at different points, as they approach the sea, into table lands of considerable extent. The coast is uninhabited, with the exception of a small town or two, and so monotonous as to weary the eye with its uniformity. About the only landmark of any interest, is Point Concepcion, the spur of a foot-hill thrust into the sea, and on the brow of which stands a Government lighthouse, with a large bell swinging in its tower. When our steamer rounded the point, the lighthouse bell was merrily rung by way of paying the customary salute.

In San Francisco, as well as elsewhere, there are wise men--prophets who utter their annual predictions. They say that earthquakes may be expected these days. The serve earthquake, which occurred here on the 21st of October, 1868, was so peculiar in its character, as to attract the attention of scientific men, who, in attempting to investigate the true cause, have advanced some ingenious theories.
</p><p>
The prevailing modern idea seems to be that earthquakes result from electrical action in the earth's crust, or in the atmosphere, simultaneous, perhaps, in both. We know that electricity is an invisible force, active or quiescent, and abounds everywhere, in a positive or negative state. When the equilibrium has been disturbed, whatever the cause, it is certain that it will be restored by a like cause. The action of the electrical forces may or may not be instantaneous. The earth is said to be a great electrical reservoir, and so, in all probability, is the atmosphere; the one positive, the other negative, generally, or at points; yet always accumulating force, quietly, or violently, in the vain endeavor to restore a perfect equilibrium. Hence, we have thunder and lightning overhead and earthquakes under foot. The forces are the same. The one is a skyquake, the other an earthquake. The one would seem to be a substitute for the other, as in California, where they never have thunder and lightning, but are amply compensated by frequent earthquakes. For eight or nine months in the year they are favored with a bright sun and a cloudless sky. When the rainy season commences, it brings with it violent electrical changes, resulting not in thunder and lightning, but in earthquakes. In this way, it may be presumed, the equilibrium is restored.
</p><p>
Fearful as earthquakes may seem, I doubt not, many more persons are killed by lightning than by earthquakes. The subtle influences of electricity are, indeed, mysterious, and doubtless constitute the life-principle which pervades all life, whether it be animal or vegetable.

The State of California is destined to become one of the richest in the Union. Its present population is estimated at six hundred thousand. The aborigines number about forty thousand, but diminish rapidly, and will soon disappear. In natural resources, the State is not exceeded by any equal extent of territory in the world. The valleys and foot-hills extending from the southern to the northern limit of the State, are but a succession of inexhaustible wealth, awaiting the labor and skill of American enterprise to develop it. Here is silver, and gold, and bread, in abundance; enough for everybody who is ready and willing to work. The only condition imposed, is intelligent labor. Nature has done her part, and now invites man to do his part. There are but two serious objections to the country; one is the want of timber, and the other the want of timely rains and more living streams. There are some places in the mountains, where red wood and pine abound, which make excellent lumber for building and fencing purposes. The California laurel is a beautiful
wood, receives a fine polish, and is much used for cabinet work. Yet much of the timber is quite inaccessible, and the transportation of such as can be obtained, is exceedingly expensive. Not a ranch or farm in the State, so far as I could see or learn, is fenced. There are but few living springs of water. Many of the few living streams are so impregnated with alkali, as to render the water unwholesome and dangerous for man or beast to drink. Here and there, where a farmer can control a mountain stream, and divert its waters into small channels so as to flow his lands, he can obtain luxuriant crops of every kind, grain and fruits, in the highest perfection. Yet, the cost of erecting plank flumes and of cutting channels, requires an outlay which but few adventurers can afford. In some localities artesian wells have been obtained at moderate expense. Horticulture in the vicinity of the larger towns proves to be a profitable pursuit. The gardeners, who are devoted to growing vegetables for the market, require a regular supply of water, which they obtain from ordinary wells and elevate into tanks by a windmill pump, and then conduct it by plank flumes and earth channels through every part of their grounds. By this means fresh vegetables and the small fruits can be grown and the towns supplied throughout the year. The process of planting
and gathering at the same time, and in the same gardens, never ceases. Corn, peas, beans, and other vegetables are planted every month, and gathered every month, and may be seen along side of each other at all times, in their various stages of growth. Only think of it, strawberries fresh from the vines every day in the year, and that too, in abundance. Isn't it a wonderful country?

The periodical winds are somewhat disagreeable, and prevail a considerable portion of the year. No fruit tree or ornamental tree can be grown without artificial irrigation and protection against the action of these prevailing winds. You must either build high board fences to protect the trees, or plant them in some valley or on some hill-side, where they will not be exposed. Nearly every tree in California leans in the direction of the prevailing winds. So you can always tell "which way the wind blows," by looking at the trees, if not by observing the laws of trade.

Almost everybody here is a speculator, especially in San Francisco, where they are constantly engaged in speculating among themselves in city lots. In fact, they have done so much at it, and at such exhorbitant rates, that they have completely shingled the city over with mortgages. They have been stimulated by the idea that eastern capitalists, now the Pacific railway is
completed, are coming with a rush to purchase most of the city, at any price. The quicker this idea explodes, the better. The inevitable result of all this must be, that property will change hands at greatly reduced figures.

In California you can regulate the climate to suit yourself. In the valleys, it is perpetual summer. In the mountains, you can have all the changes of the four seasons. In one day's travel you can reach a region where it is spring, summer, fall, or winter, as you may prefer. It is, therefore, a glorious country for invalids, as well as for people in sound health. Here you have all the luxuries, fruits, flowers and vegetables, which either a temperate or tropical clime can produce. What more can one wish or desire? Yet here, as elsewhere, I believe no one is fully satisfied with his condition in life.

The Asiatics having espied out this "goodly land," are now arriving in great numbers, with a view to share its wealth and test its capabilities. Here they say they can grow tea, silk, sugar and spices as well as in their own country. The land is cheaper and much more fertile. The cheap table lands they regard as admirably adapted to the silk and tea culture. In a few years, I doubt not, the foot-hills and elevated table lands will be crowned with the tea plant and the mulberry, and
the valleys enriched with extensive fields of sugar cane. But the Americans will still retain their power and controlling influence; monopolize the best lands, and take the lead in all lucrative enterprises. They will still plan, invent, and conduct the commerce of the country. The Asiatic element will do no harm, but on the contrary, aid in promoting a rapid development. In view of what has already been achieved, it may be said, that the future of California knows no limit. Yet here, as well as elsewhere, fluctuations in business affairs, and in the value of property, often occur. "All is not gold that glitters."
