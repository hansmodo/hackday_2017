</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 20th ult. came duly to hand a 
few days ago. 
</p><p>
I cannot apprehend that any difficulties can ensue in Europe 
from the involuntary and immaterial delay of the ratification 
of the peace, or if there should, that any imputations can be devised which will not be repelled by the collective force of the 
reasons in the intended protest, some of which, singly taken, are 
unanswerable. As you no doubt had recourse to authorities 
which I have no opportunity of consulting, I probably err in 
supposing the right of the Sovereign to reject the act of his 
plenipotentiary to be more circumscribed than you lay it down. 
I recollect well that an implied condition is annexed by the 
usage of nations to a Plenipotentiary Commission, but should 
not have extended the implication beyond cases where some 
palpable and material default in the Minister could be alledged 
by the Sovereign. Waiving some such plea, the language both 
of the Commission and of reason seems to fix on the latter as 
clear an engagement to fulfil his promise to ratify a treaty, as 
to fulfil the promises of a treaty which he has ratified. In both 
cases, one would pronounce the obligation equally personal to 
the Sovereign, and a failure on his part, without some absolving 
circumstance, equally a breach of faith. 
</p><p>
The project of affixing the seal of the United States, by seven 
States, to an act ivliicli had been just admitted to require nine, 
must have stood self-condemned; and though it might have produced a temporary deception abroad, must have been immediately detected at home, and have finally dishonored the 
federal counsels everywhere. The competency of seven States 
to a Treaty of Peace has often been a subject of debate in Congress, and has sometimes been admitted into their practice, at 
least so far as to issue fresh instructions. The reasoning employed in defence of the doctrine has been, " that the cases which 
require nine States, being exceptions to the general authority 
of seven States, ought to be taken strictly; that in the enumeration of the powers of Congress in the first clause of article 9 
of the Confederation, the power of entering into treaties and 
alliances is contradistinguished from that of determining on 
peace and war, and even separated by the intervening power of 
sending and receiving ambassadors ; that the excepting clause, 
therefore, in which ' Treaties and alliances ' ought to be taken 
in the same confined sense, and in which the power of determining on peace is omitted, cannot be extended by construction 
to the latter power ; that under such a construction five States 
might continue a war which it required nine to commence, 
though where the object of the war has been obtained, a continuance must in every view be equivalent to a commencement 
of it, and that the very means provided for preserv.g a state 
of peace might thus become the means of preventing its restoration." 
</p><p>
The answer to these arguments has been, that the construction 
of the federal articles which they maintain is a nicety which 
reason disclaims, and that if it be dangerous on one side to 
leave it in the breast of five States to protract a war, it is 
equally necessary on the other to restrain seven States from 
saddling the Union with any stipulations which they may please 
to interweave with a Treaty of peace. I was once led by this 
question to search the files of Congress for such lights as the 
history of the Confederation might furnish, and on a review 
now of my papers, I find the evidence from that source to consist 
of the following circumstances: In Doctor Franklin's "Sketch 
of Articles of Confederation," laid before Congress on the 21st 
day of July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>, no number beyond a majority is required in 
any cases. In the plan reported to Congress by the Committee 
appointed llth June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, the general enumeration of the 
powers of Congress in article 18 is expressed in a similar manner with the first clause in the present 9th article, as are the 
exceptions in a subsequent clause of the 18th article of the 
report, with the excepting clause as it now stands ; and yet in 
the margin of the Report, and I believe in the same handwriting, 
there is a " Qu. : If so large a majority is necessary in concluding a Treaty of peace." There are sundry other marginal 
queries in the report from the same pen. 
</p><p>
Hence it would seem that, notwithstanding the preceding discrimination between the powers of " determining on peace" and 
"entering into Treaties," the latter was meant by the Committee 
to comprise the former. The next form in which the articles 
appear is a printed copy of the Report as it had been previously 
amended, with sundry amendments, erasures, and notes, on the 
printed copy itself, in the hand of Mr. Thomson. In the printed 
text of this paper, Art. 14, the phraseology which defines the 
general powers of Congress is the same with that in Art. 18 
of the manuscript report. In the subsequent clause requiring 
nine States, the text as printed ran thus : " The United States 
in Congress assembled shall never engage in a war, nor grant 
of marque and reprisal in time of peace, nor enter into 
any Treaties or alliances except for peace," the words except 
for peace being erased, but sufficiently legible through the 
erasure. The fair inference from this passage seems to be : 1. 
That without those words nine States were held to be required 
for concluding peace. 2. That an attempt had been made to 
render seven States competent to such an act, which attempt 
must have succeeded, either on a preceding discussion in Congress, or in a Committee of the whole, or a special committee. 
3. That on fuller deliberation, the power of making Treaties of 
peace was meant to be left on the same footing with that of 
making all other Treaties. The remaining papers on the files 
have no reference to this question. 
</p><p>
Another question which several times during my serv.e in 
Congress exercised their deliberations was, whether seven States 
could revoke a Commission for a Treaty issued by nine States, 
at any time before the faith of the Confederacy should be 
pledged under it. In the instance of a proposition in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1781">1781</a> to 
revoke a Commission which had been granted under peculiar 
circumstances in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a> to Adams, to form a treaty of commerce 
with Great Britain, the competency of seven States was resolved 
on, (by seven States indeed,) and a revocation took place accordingly. It was, however, effected with much difficulty, and 
some members of the minority even contested the validity of 
the proceeding. My own opinion then was, and still is, that 
the proceeding was equally valid and expedient. The circumstances which had given birth to the commission had given 
place to others totally different; not a single step had been 
taken under the commission which could affect the honor or 
faith of the United States, and it surely can never be said that 
either the letter or spirit of the Confederation requires the 
same majority to decline as to engage in foreign treaties. The 
safest method of guarding against the execution of those great 
powers, after the circumstances which dictated them have 
changed, is to limit their duration, trusting to renewals as they 
expire, if the original reasons continue. My experience of the 
uncertainty of getting an affirmative vote even of seven States 
had determined me, before I left Congress, always to contend 
for such limitations. 
</p><p>
I thought the sense of the term " appropriation " had been 
settled by the latter practice of Congress to be the same as you 
take it to be. I always understood that to be the true, the 
parliamentary, and the only rational sense. If no distinction 
be admitted between the "appropriation of money to general 
uses" and "expenditures in detail," the Secretary of Congress 
could not buy quills or wafers without a vote of nine States 
entered on record, and the Secretary to the Committee of the 
States could not do it at all. In short, unless one vote of appropriation can extend to a class of objects, there must be a 
physical impossibility of providing for them; and the extent 
and generality of such classes can only be determined by discretion and conveniency. It is observ.le, that in the specification of the powers which require nine States, the single technical word " appropriate " is retained. In the general recital 
which precedes, the word "apply" as well as "appropriate" is 
used. 
</p><p>
You were not mistaken in supposing I had in conversation 
restrained the authority of the federal Court to territorial disputes, but I was egregiously so in the opinion I had formed. 
Whence I got it I am utterly at a loss to account. It could not 
be from the Confederation itself, for words could not be more 
explicit. I detected the error a few days ago in consulting the 
articles on another subject, and had noted it for my next letter 
to you. 
</p><p>
I am not sure that I comprehend your idea of a cession of 
the Territory beyond the Kenhaway and on this side the Ohio. 
As all the soil of value has been granted out to individuals, a 
cession in that view would be improper, and a cession of the 
jurisdiction to Congress can be proper only where the Country 
is vacant of settlers. I presume your meaning, therefore, to be 
no more than a separation of that country from this, and an 
incorporation of it into the Union; a work to which all three 
must be parties. I have no reason to believe there will be any 
repugnance on the part of Virginia. 
</p><p>
The effort of Pennsylvania for the "Western commerce does 
credit to her public councils. The commercial genius of this 
State is too much in its infancy, I fear, to rival the example. 
Were this less the case, the confusion of its affairs must stifle 
all enterprize. I shall be better able, however, to judge of the 
practicability of your hint when I know more of them. 
</p><p>
The declension of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=georgetown" rel="city">GEORGETOWN</a> does not surprize me, tho' it 
gives me regret. If the competition should lie between Trenton 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and depend on the vote of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, it is 
not difficult to foresee into which scale it will be thrown, nor 
the probable effect of such decision on our Southern hopes. 
</p><p>
I have long regarded the council as a grave of useful talents, 
as well as objectionable in point of expence, yet I see not how 
such a reform as you suggest can be brought about. The Constitution, tho' readily overleaped by the Legislature on the 
spur of an occasion, would probably be made a bar to such an 
innovation. It directs that eight members be kept up, and requires the sanction of four to almost every act of the Governor. 
Is it not to be feared, too, that these little meliorations of the 
Government may turn the edge of some of the arguments which 
ought to be laid to its root ? I grow every day more and more 
solicitous to see this essential work begun. Every day's delay 
settles the Government deeper into the habits of the people, and 
strengthens the prop which their acquiescence gives it. My 
field of observ.ion is too small to warrant any conjecture of 
the public disposition towards the measure; but all with whom 
I converse lend a ready ear to it. Much will depend on the 
politics of Mr. Henry, which are wholly unknown to me. 
Should they be adverse, and G. Mason not in the Assembly, 
hazardous as delay is, the experiment must be put off to a more 
auspicious conjuncture. 
</p><p>
The charter granted in 1732 to Lord <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> makes, if I 
mistake not, the Southern shore of the Potowmac the boundary 
of Maryland on that side. The Constitution of Virginia cedes 
to that State "all the territories contained within its charter, 
with all the rights of property , jurisdiction, and Government, and 
all other rights whatsoever, which might at any time have been 
claimed by Virginia, excepting only the free navigation and use 
of the Rivers Potowmac and Pohomoque, &c." Is it not to be 
apprehended that this language will be construed into an entire 
relinquishment of the Jurisdiction of these rivers, and will not 
such a construction be fatal to our port regulations on that side, 
and otherwise highly inconvenient ? I was told on my journey 
along the Potowmac of several flagrant evasions which had 
been practiced with impunity and success by foreign vessels 
which had loaded at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a>. The jurisdiction of half the 
rivers ought to have been expressly reserv.. The terms of 
the surrender are the more extraordinary as the patents of the 
N. neck place the whole river Potowmac within the Government of Virginia; so that we were armed with a title both of 
prior and posterior date to that of Maryland. What will be 
the best course to repair the error? to extend our laws upon 
the River, making Maryland the plaintiff if she chooses to contest their authority to state the case to her at once and propose a settlement by negociation or to propose a mutual appointment of Commissioners for the general purpose of preserv.g a harmony and efficacy in the regulations on both sides? 
The last mode squares best with my present ideas. It can give 
no irritation to Maryland; it can weaken no plea of Virginia; 
it will give Maryland an opportunity of stirring the question if 
she chooses; and will not be fruitless if Maryland should admit 
our jurisdiction. If I see the subject in its true light, no time 
should be lost in fixing the interest of Virginia. The good 
humour into which the cession of the back lands must have put 
Maryland forms an apt crisis for any negotiations which may 
be necessary. You will be able, probably, to look into her 
charter and her laws, and to collect the leading sentiments relative to the matter. 
The winter has been so severe that I have never renewed my 
call on the library of Monticello, and the time is now drawing 
so near when I may pass for a while into a different scene, that 
I shall await at least the return to my studies. Mr. L. Grymes 
told me a few days ago that a few of your books which had 
been borrowed by Mr. W. Maury, and ordered by him to be 
sent to his brother's, the clergyman, on their way to Monticello, 
were still at the place which Mr. M. removed from. I desired 
Mr. Grymes to send them to me instead of the Parson, supposing, as the distance is less, the books will probably be sooner 
out of danger from accidents, and that a conveyance from hence 
will not be less convenient. I calculated, also, on the use of 
such of them as may fall within my plan. 
</p><p>
I lately got home the trunk which contained my Buffon, but 
have barely entered upon him. My time begins already to be 
much less my own than during the winter blockade. I must 
leave to your discretion the occasional purchase of rare and 
valuable books, disregarding the risk of duplicates. You know 
tolerably well the objects of my curiosity. I will only particularize my wish of whatever may throw light on the general 
constitution and droit publique of the several confederacies 
which have existed. I observ.in Boenaud's catalogue several 
pieces on the Dutch, the German, and the Helvetic. The operations of our own must render all such lights of consequence. 
Books on the law of N. & N. fall within a similar remark. The 
tracts of Bynkershoeck, which you mention, I must trouble you 
to get for me, and in French, if to be had, rather than latin. 
Should the body of his works come nearly as cheap as these 
select publications, perhaps it may be worth considering whether 
the whole would not be preferable. Is not Wolfius also worth 
having ? I recollect to have seen at Pritchard's a copy of Hawkin's abridgement of Co. Litt. I would willingly take it if it 
be still there, and you have an opportunity. A copy of Deane's 
, which were printed in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and which I failed to 
get before I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I should also be glad of. I use 
this freedom in confidence that you will be equally free in consulting your own conveniency whenever I encroach upon it. I 
hope you will be so, particularly in the request I have to add. 
One of my parents would be considerably gratified with a 
pair of good spectacles, which are not to be got here. The particular readiness of Dudley to serv.you inclines me to think 
that an order from you would be well executed. Will you, 
therefore, be so good as to get from him one of his best pebble 
and double-jointed pair, for the age fifty-five, or thereabouts, 
with a good case, and forward them by the first safe conveyance to me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> or at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, as the case may be. If 
I had thought of this matter before Mr. Maury set out, I might 
have lessened your trouble. It is not material whether I be 
repayed at the Bank of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> or the Treasury of Virginia, but I beg it may be at neither till you are made secure 
by public remittances. It will be necessary, at any rate, for 
20 or 30 to be left in your hands or in the Bank for little expenditures which your kindness is likely to bring upon you.

The Executive of South Carolina, as I am informed by the 
Attorney, have demanded of Virginia the surrender of a citizen 
of Virginia, charged on the affidavit of Jonas Beard, Esqr., 
whom the Executive of South Carolina represent to be " a Justice of the peace, a member of the Legislature, and a valuable, 
good man," as follows: that " three days before the 25th day of 
October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>, he (Mr. Beard) was violently assaulted by G. 
H., during the sitting of the Court of General Sessions, without 
any provocation thereto given, who beat him (Mr. B.) with his 
fist and switch over the face, head, and mouth, from which beating he was obliged to keep his room until the said 25th day of 
October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>, and call in the assistance of a physician." Such 
is the case as collected by Mr. Randolph from the letter of the 
Executive of South Carolina. The questions which arise upon 
it are: 1. Whether it be a charge of high misdemesnor within 
the meaning of the fourth Article of Confederation. 2. Whether, 
in expounding the terms high misdemeanor, the law of South 
Carolina, or the British law as in force in the United States 
before the Revolution, ought to be the standard. 3. If it be 
not a casus foederis, what the law of nations exacts of Virginia? 
4. If the law of nations contains no adequate provision for such 
occurrences, whether the intimacy of the Union among the 
States, the relative position of some, and the common interest 
of all them in guarding against impunity for offences which can 
be punished only by the jurisdiction within which they are committed, do not call for some supplemental regulations on this 
subject? Mr. Randolph thinks Virginia not bound to surrender 
the fugitive until she be convinced of the facts, by more substantial information, and of its amounting to a high misdemesnor, 
by inspection of the law of South Carolina, which, and not the 
British law, ought to be the criterion. His reasons are too 
long to be rehearsed. 
</p><p>
I know not, my dear sir, what to reply to the affectionate 
invitation which closes your letter. I subscribe to the justness 
of your general reflections; I feel the attractions of the particular situation you point out to me. I cannot altogether renounce 
the prospect, still less can I as yet embrace it. It is very far 
from being improbable that a few years more may prepare me 
for giving such a destiny to my future life, in which case the 
same or some equally convenient spot may be commanded by a 
little augmentation of price. But wherever my final lot may 
fix me, be assured that I shall ever remain, with the sincerest 
affection and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your friend and serv.t.
