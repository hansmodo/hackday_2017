DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have just received the honor of yours of the 27th instant. The last evening we moved back from 
the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=kings bridge' rel='city'>King's Bridge</a> ; <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>'s troops to Dobbs's Ferry and Tarrytown ; the 
Connecticut militia, to New Rochelle; and the York militia, towards White Plains. This remove was for the following reasons. 
</p><p>
We could not reduce the fort by cannonade, being destitute of proper artillery. As to taking of it by storm, it is surrounded by chevaux-de-frise, hooked together; yet I think it might have been taken, if we had been so happy as to have had a few Continental 
troops. But our army is all militia, and your Excellency well knows that they are by no means adequate to such an enterprise. The houses in the vicinity are so scattered, that the troops were every 
hour exposed to surprise, if the enemy should make 
a sudden sally, or continually harassed by keeping 
out large guards exposed, in the open air, to the in 
clemency of the season ; and, as there remained little 
or no probability of success, either against the fort 
or island, and the principal object now being to collect the forage, protect the well-disposed, and curb 
the disaffected, the Generals who were present in 
council, namely, Lincoln, Wooster, Ten Broeck, and 
Scott, were unanimously of opinion that, as the be 
fore-mentioned purposes could be as well answered 
by the troops falling back, as remaining so near the 
fort, and many inconveniences avoided, the manoeuvre 
was advisable; and it was accordingly made. 
We have collected considerable quantities of forage. 
At present, it is stored at Kingstreet and Wright's 
Mills. Large quantities are still uncollected. 
</p><p>
The person who lately brought me intelligence from 
the city has,, since I wrote your Excellency, mentioned one piece which, if true (and he thinks it is), 
is very extraordinary, namely, that General Carletons 
army formed a junction with Howe's before the army 
went into the Jerseys ; and that a small garrison 
only is left at Quebec. It is reported here, and 
gains credit, that the enemy have burnt Newport and 
left Rhode Island. 
</p><p>
Daniel Strang was executed at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, on Monday last, agreeably to his sentence. The Tories gave out that we dare not hang him. I have the honor to be 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
W. HEATH.
