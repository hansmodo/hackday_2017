MY DEAR SIR, ***** 
</p><p>
My last was of the 19th. I have since seen several of the 
National Gazettes, which continue to teem with animadversions 
on the Proclamation. My opinion of it was expressed in my 
last. I foresee that a communication of it will make a part of 
the speech to the next Congress, and that it will bring on some 
embarrassments. Much will depend on events in Europe; and 
it is to be regretted that the popularity of the President or the 
policy of our Government should ever be staked on such contingencies. I observ.that our vessels are frequently and insolently seized and searched for French goods. Is not this complained of by our own people as a breach of the modern law of 
nations; and whilst British goods are protected by the neutrality of our bottoms, will not remonstrances come from France 
on the subject?
