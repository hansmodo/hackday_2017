Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
In another letter of this date, I have mentioned a 
part of yesterday's conversation with the Count de 
Montmorin. That part of it, which I am now to communicate, is for yourself alone. As Monsieur de Lafayette had asked me some days ago, who should be 
sent to replace the Comte de Moustier, and upon 
my answering with great indifference, that it might 
be whom he pleased, had asked my opinion of Colonel Ternant, I told the Count de Montmorin this circumstance ; to which he replied, that he had communicated his intention to Monsieur de Lafayette some 
time since, in consequence of the intimacy which has 
long subsisted between them. I asked him, if he 
would permit me to mention it to you. The idea 
gave him pleasure, and he told me that he should 
consider it as a very great kindness, and particularly 
if through the same channel he could learn whether 
that appointment would be agreeable to you. This 
is, you know, a compliment which the most respectable 
Courts on this side of the Atlantic usually pay to 
each other. It is not without use, and on the present 
occasion is not a mere compliment, because Monsieur de Montmorin is sincerely desirous of cultivating a 
good understanding with the United States. 
</p><p>
It is not impossible that he may retreat from his 
present office ; but he will, I think, in that case be 
appointed Governor to the children of France, and 
his opinions, while about the Court, will have weight, 
for many reasons ; amongst others, because they deserve it. In talking over the deplorable situation to 
which this kingdom is reduced, I told him that I 
saw no means of establishing peace at home, but by 
making war abroad. He replied that he thought with 
me, in part; namely, that an offensive war might be 
useful. But that he thought a defensive war must 
prove ruinous ; that this last seemed the more likely 
to happen; and that in either case the state of the 
finances was alarming. I observed, that ability in that 
department might restore it, even during a war ; that 
nothins: could revive credit without the reestablishment of executive authority; and that nothing could 
effect that reestablishment but a general sense of the 
necessity. Upon this, he lamented the want of a 
Chief Minister, who might embrace the great whole 
of public business. He owns himself unequal to the 
task, and too indolent into the bargain. 
</p><p>
Our friend Lafayette burns with desire to be at the 
head of an army in Flanders, and drive the Stadtholder into a ditch. He acts now a splendid, but 
dangerous part. Unluckily, he has given in to measures, as to the Constitution, which he does not heartily approve, and he heartily approves many things 
which experience will demonstrate to be injurious. 
While all is in confusion here, the revolt of Austrian 
Flanders, and the troubles excited in Poland by the 
agency of Prussia, give every reason to suppose that 
the King of Sweden will be vigorously supported ; 
so that provided the Turk has but a sufficient share 
of obstinacy to bear a little more beating, the scale, 
according to human probabilities, must turn against 
Austria and Prussia, who are the allies of France. 
Great Britain is, as j^et, no otherwise engaged than 
as an eventual party ; and, according to the best 
opinion which my judgment can form, upon the information I have been able to obtain, the Premier of 
that country can, to use the words of Mr. Addison, 
"ride in the whirlwind and direct the storm." A person, however, on whose knowledge I have some reliance, assures me that Mr. Pitt, engrossed by borough 
politics and ignorant of Continental affairs, takes no 
part in them, but wdiat he is absolutely forced into; 
and I am inclined to believe that there is some truth 
in that assertion. Accept I pray the assurances of 
that sincere esteem, with which I am yours, &c.
