A tremendous wave struck the vessel Tuesday morning, covering the deck with several feet of water and rolling some of the passengers from side to side, ducking them most thoroughly. The same wave rolled a volume of water down the hatchway, covering the greater part of our cabin with three to six inches, which floated some of the trunks about and wet some of their contents. Since shipping the heavy sea, the hatch to our cabin has been left closed. The
wind suddenly increased to a violent gale, blowing our spanker sheet to pieces, throwing the man at the wheel down, shipping heavy seas, knocking and rolling us about as though we were but feathers. Indeed it blew "great guns" and was decidedly the stormiest time we have had. One of the sailors, named Pete, refused to do duty and, when expostulated with, drew his knife and made a dash at the first mate. He was then put in irons and received a flogging. He appears to be a half-crazy sort of fellow, and this is not his first misdemeanor.

As we were lying to Wednesday night, another tremendous wave struck us about 12 o'clock, making the good old ship quiver like a wounded bird, and twisting our rudder into splinters like a broom. This was not felt until morning, and when the announcement was made that we were without a rudder, terror and despair were pictured upon the countenances of many, while others treated it with rather unbecoming levity. The Captain thought seriously of endeavoring to get back to Montevideo, or Rio de Janeiro, but upon consultation with his officers he was dissuaded from this course, and made a determined effort to reach Valparaiso. By the valuable assistance of several passengers who are carpenters, the rudder was temporarily fixed. Our experience around "these diggin's" would almost induce us to believe that nothing prevails but gales or dead calms, rain or snow, and but very little sunshine. Snow showers have been almost a daily occurrence, and the decks continually wet with rain and snow, making it very disagreeable. After a gale which carried away our spanker sheet and rocked the vessel, we found ourselves in a dead calm, when the smoothness of the sea enabled R. Taylor, who volunteered his services, to mend our rudder in such a manner that it may now be
depended upon. Several of the seamen have been disabled and the Captain could neither make nor take in sail without calling on the passengers.

Friday morning the startling announcement was made that on account of this continual tossing about by the storms and waves, we had unexpectedly lost about 1,400 gallons of water out of a large square iron tank and as a consequence, the passengers would be allowed but one quart per day for all purposes, excepting the ship's crew, who had to do duty, and they were allowed two quarts. At four P.M. each one stalked up to the water cask with his bottle or demijohn and received his meager allowance. Before bedtime some of them had emptied their bottles, not even leaving a drop for breakfast. As nothing fresh can be cooked without water (salt junk is cooked in salt water), this being put on a quart per day is rather a serious matter and not to be trifled with. Indeed, we find the quart-of-water business quite close enough. Some take a drop of tea in the morning, while others reserve all for drinking, or give half a gill for the purpose of getting a fresh roll baked; the cook could do this by adding a portion of salt water. For my own part, I have not suffered very much for water, though I have saved enough to make four biscuits. We had a very smart snow shower and then nearly all of the passengers could have been seen gathering up the mite of snow and converting it into water. I gathered one large ball which made about a gill of water when melted.

Pagan worshippers never clung closer to their idols than we now do to our bottles and it need not be wondered at for they constitute our all. Some of us have often been pinched with thirst without the wherewith to quench it. It has become a saying that misfortunes
never come singly, and we have had a verification of this. The continual succession of storms and head winds has kept us beating five weeks without making that many hundred miles on our course.
</p><p>
As we go north, quite a sensible difference for the better is felt in the atmosphere. Two of the seamen show symptoms of the scurvy, but it is hoped it will not get bad. A very fine sea pie was made and was enjoyed by us all today, though the porkers slaughtered were poor and lean.

This evening Rogers read a chapter in the Bible, as well as an excellent tract, to which great attention was paid by all, even some upper cabin passengers, except Messrs. Marvin, Paine, H. and Mrs. H. But I am glad to say that they are the only persons who thus break in upon and transgress all moral as well as divine law. They were even boisterous enough to interfere with the reading. Last evening songs were sung, among others "Billy Taylor." We had fiddling and later in the night the "owlers" commenced operations and had a merry spree, keeping up their noisy revels until two o'clock this morning.

BILLY TAYLOR*

<blockquote>
    Billy Taylor was a brisk young fellow,<br/>
    Full of fun, and full of glee,<br/>
    And his mind he did discover<br/>
    To a lady fair and free.<br/>
    Four and twenty brisk young fellows<br/>
    Drest they were in rich array<br/>
    And they took poor Billy Taylor,<br/>
    Whom they press'd and sent to sea.<br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    And his truelove follow'd after<br/>
    Under the name of Richard Car,<br/>
    Her lilly-white hands were bedaub'd all over<br/>
    With the nasty pitch and tar.<br/>
    Now behold, the first engagement<br/>
    Bold she fought among the rest<br/>
    Till the wind did blow her jacket<br/>
    And discovered her lilly-white breast.<br/>
    When that the captain came for to view it<br/>
    Says he, "What wind has blown you here?"<br/>
    "Sir, I be come to seek my truelove<br/>
    Whom you press'd I love so dear."<br/>
    "If you be come to seek your treasure<br/>
    Tell to me his name, I pray."<br/>
    "Sir, his name is Billy Taylor<br/>
    Whom you press'd and sent to sea."<br/>
    "If his name is Billy Taylor,<br/>
    He is both cruel and severe,<br/>
    For rise up early in the morning<br/>
    And you'll see him with his lady fair."<br/>
    With that she rose up early next morning,<br/>
    Early by the break of day,<br/>
    And there she saw bold Billy Taylor<br/>
    Dancing with his lady gay.<br/>
    With that she called for sword and pistol,<br/>
    Which did come at her command,<br/>
    And there she shoot bold Billy Taylor<br/>
    With his truelove in his hand.<br/>
    When that the captain came for to know it<br/>
    He very much applauded her for what she had done,<br/>
    And immediately made her the first lieutenant<br/>
    Of the glorious Thunder Bumb.<br/>
