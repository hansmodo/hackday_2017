MY DEAR MR. CRAMER:
</p><p>
We have now been very well through India and are this far on our way to
the farther East. The weather has been pleasant until within the last
few days. But now it is becoming very warm, and as we have yet to go
through the Straits of Malacca near the equator before turning north,
we must expect some discomfort. I have been very much pleased with
English rule and English hospitality in India. With that rule two
hundred and fifty millions of uncivilized people are living at peace
with each other, and are not only drawing their subsistence from the
soil but are exporting a large excess over imports from it. It would be
a sad day for the people of India and for the commerce of the world if
the English should withdraw. We hope to be in Hong Kong by the middle
of April, and farther north in China as soon thereafter as possible.
When a good climate is reached we shall regulate our further movements
by the reports of weather on seas to be traversed, and climate of
places to be visited. At present, however, we expect to reach San
Francisco about the first half of July. Although homesick to be settled
down I dread getting back. The clamor of the partisan and so-called
independent press win be such as to make life there unpleasant for a
time.
</p><p>
Mrs. Grant joins me in love to you, Mary, and the children.
</p><p>
I have to-day written a letter to Mr. Corbin.
</p><p>
Very truly yours,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.

<p>
P.S. Julia asks me to add, to tell Mary that the English speak in the
highest terms of the work being done all through this country by the
missionaries, especially in an educational way. They say they are doing
much good.
