Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The country T now inhabit, on which so many other countries 
depend, having sunk to absolute nothingness, has deranged the 
general state of things in every quarter ; and what complicates 
the scene in no small degree is the incertitude which prevails, as 
to her future fate, because a new system, calculated on the palsied state of France, would be as effectually deranged by her 
recovery, as that was which leaned upon her greatness heretofore 
and fell in her fall. The northern courts, removed at a greater distance from her influence, had provided for themselves by 
an alliance, which took place immediately after the peace between Sweden and Russia. I think I hinted in a former letter 
my expectation, that a new system would arise there. In effect 
a treaty concluded between what may be called the Baltic powers will have considerable influence hereafter upon the general system. When you recollect that they are exclusively the 
magazine of naval stores in this hemisphere, your comprehensive mind will seize at once the consequences, which may follow 
to America from combinations where such articles are indispensable. This same Baltic is also a granary for southern Europe. 
Hence a new source of important reflection. I think that occasions will ere long present themselves, in which America may 
be essentially concerned. But to come nearer to my present 
position, the Emperor disengaged from the Turk and likely to 
be soon repossessed of Flanders, will be there in the command 
of fifty thousand men, besides the resource which every sovereign derives from an unsuccessful revolt. The King of Prussia 
is no longer at the head of an effective Germanic league. The 
fear of Austria and her connexions has, for evident reasons, 
subsided, and the Baron Hertzberg, rather a pedant than politician, but illy fills that great void which was left by the death of 
Frederick. In fact, Prussia seems to be just that country in shape, 
extent, fertility, population, connexion, and relation, which 
one would have chosen to show what great genius can do with 
incompetent materials, and what a dream is human greatness. 
</p><p>
The Emperor is in possession of proofs, that the spirit of re 
volt through all his dominions was fostered by that court, and 
would have broken out in every quarter at the instant of a war. 
Hence the sudden pacification at Reichenback, of which the 
Prussian was the dupe, though he dictated terms. You will readily suppose that Leopold, neither as a man nor a statesman, can 
look on such conduct in the calm sight of mild philosophy. 
Hereditary claims to dominion, which his rival is possessed of, 
a long opposition of jarring interests, and the bitterness of that 
cup he has just been forced to drink, must lead him to seek and 
to seize the moment of vengeance. Forgiveness is not a family feature in the House of Lorraine, neither is Italy the school 
of Christian meekness. On the other hand, the alliance between him and the late sovereign of this country is rent to tatters. Not formally cancelled, it is effectually annulled. The 
French nation hate the Emperor, and detest a connexion, which 
seems nevertheless to be the wisest that could have been formed. 
</p><p>
The great power of this monarchy has been for centuries an insurmountable barrier to imperial ambition. Leopold must 
therefore wish to see it injured, and even dismembered. Many of the German princes, who have rights within the boundaries of France, secured to them by numerous treaties, and 
guarantied by the Germanic corps, but lately violated by the 
National Assembly, wish the whole empire to insist on restitution, and in case of refusal to engage in a war, whose object 
would be the recovery of Alsace and Lorraine. Many of the 
discontented nobles and clergy of France are urgent with the 
chief of the empire to avenge the insults offered to his unfortunate sister. So fair a pretext, such plausible reasons, both 
public and private, joined to a great political interest and personal territorial claims, might determine an enterprising prince. 
But he is cautious ; trusting more to art than force. He sits on a throne which lately tottered, and is hardly yet confirmed. 
He has before him the example of a predecessor, whose incessant toils brought only an increase of laborious care ; whose 
anxieties wore away the web of his existence ; and whose 
mighty projects were but the  baseless fabric of a vision. The Germanic body itself is distracted between the duty of 
supporting its members, and a dread of destroying the check upon its chief. 
</p><p>
This unhappy country, bewildered in the pursuit of meta 
physical whimsies, presents to our moral view a mighty ruin. 
Like the remnants of ancient magnificence, we admire the architecture of the temple, while we detest the false god to whom 
it was dedicated. Daws and ravens, and the birds of night, 
now build their nests in its nitches. The sovereign, humbled to 
the level of a beggar's pity, without resources, without authority, 
without a friend. The Assembly at once a master and a slave, 
new in power, wild in theory, raw in practice. It engrosses 
all functions though incapable of exercising any, and has taken 
from this fierce ferocious people every restraint of religion and 
of respect. Sole executors of the law, and therefore suprerne 
judges of its propriety, each district measures out its obedience by its wishes, and the great interests of the whole, split 
up into fractional morsels, depend on momentary impulse and 
ignorant caprice. Such a state of things cannot last. 
</p><p>
But how will it end ? Here conjecture may wander through 
unbounded space. What sum of misery may be requisite to 
change popular will, calculation cannot determine. What circumstances may arise in the order of Divine Providence to give 
direction to that will, our sharpest vision cannot discover. 
What talents may be found to seize those circumstances, to 
influence that will, and above all to moderate the power which 
it must confer, we are equally ignorant of. One thing only 
seems to be tolerably ascertained, that the glorious opportunity 
is lost, and (for this time at least) the revolution has failed. In 
the consequences of it we may however find some foundation 
of future prosperity. Such are, 1. The abolition of those different rights and privileges, which kept the provinces asunder, occasioning thereby a variety of taxation, increasing the expenses 
of collection, impeding the useful communication of commerce, 
and destroying that unity in the system of distributive justice, 
which is one requisite to social happiness. 2. The abolition of 
feudal tyranny, by which the tenure of real property is simplified, the value reduced to money, rent is more clearly ascertained, and the estimation which depended upon idle vanity, or 
capricious taste, or sullen pride, is destroyed. 3. The extension of the circle of commerce to those vast possessions held by 
the clergy in mortmain, which conferring great wealth as the 
wages of idleness, damped the ardor of enterprise, and impaired that ready industry, which, increases the stock of national 
riches. 4. The destruction of a system of venal jurisprudence, 
which, arrogating a kind of legislative veto, had established the 
pride and privileges of the few, on the misery and degradation 
of the general mass, 5. Above all, the promulgation and ex 
tension of those principles of liberty, which will, I hope, remain 
to cheer the heart and cherish a nobleness of soul, when the 
metaphysical froth and vapor shall have been blown away. 
The awe of that spirit which has been thus raised, will, I trust, 
excite in those who may hereafter possess authority a proper 
moderation in its exercise, and induce them to give to this 
people a real constitution of government, fitted to the natural, 
moral, social, and political state of their country. 
</p><p>
How and when these events may be brought about I know 
not. But I think from the chaos of opinion, and the conflict 
of its jarring elements, a new order will at length arise, which 
though in some degree the child of chance, may not be less 
productive of human happiness, than the forethought provisions of human speculation. 
</p><p>
In the beginning of this year I mentioned the conviction that, 
during the course of it, the then ministry would wear out. 
This has been literally verified, and M. de Montmorin is the 
only remaining shred of the old garment. As to the present 
temporary set, I shall say nothing just now, reserving to a better opportunity some sentiments on particular men. The object of this letter is, as you will observe, to communicate as 
nearly as I can that state of things, which may in a greater or 
smaller degree be forced upon your attention. I must add the 
conviction, that my letters present very different prospects from 
those, which may reach you through other channels. You, who 
know mankind thoroughly, will be able to form a solid opinion ; 
and however that may vary from mine, I shall still rejoice if 
even by the display of false ideas, I shall have cast any additional light upon those which are true. I am always, &c.
