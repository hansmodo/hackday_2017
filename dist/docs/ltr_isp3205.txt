DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear informing your Excellency, by the 
return of Major Humphreys to camp, of the state of 
my health, from the first of my illness to the present time. 
</p><p>
After I was prevented from coming on to the 
army, by a stroke of the paralytic kind, which deprived me, in a great measure, of the use of my 
right leg and arm, I retired to my plantation, and 
have been gradually growing better ever since. I 
have now so far gained the use of my limbs, especially of my leg, as to be able to walk with very 
little impediment, and to ride on horseback tolerably 
well. In other respects I am in perfect health, and 
enjoy the comforts and pleasures of life with as good a relish as most of my neighbours. 
</p><p>
Although I should not be able to resume a command in the army, I propose to myself the happiness 
of making a visit, and seeing my friends there some 
time in the course of the campaign. And, however 
incapable I may be of serving my country, to my 
latest hour my wishes and prayers will always be 
most ardent and sincere for its happiness and freedom. As a principal instrument in the hand of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> for effecting this, may Heaven long preserve 
your Excellency's most important and valuable life. 
</p><p>
Not being able to hold the pen in my own hand, 
I am obliged to make use of another to express with 
how much regard and esteem, I am, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=isp" rel="me">ISRAEL PUTNAM</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I am making a great effort to use my hand 
to make the initials of my name, for the first time. 
</p><p>
I. P.
