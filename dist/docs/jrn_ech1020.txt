Our repose at night has been somewhat interrupted by the almost continual braying of mules feeding on the hills near by. Yesterday morning McCowan and I wandered some distance up the creek in search of wood for shovel handles, but we found it a very difficult matter to get anything straight enough. We therefore cut down a small oak with our hatchets, took the butt and split it in two, and dressed them. But they made rather indifferent handles, so much so that I cut a willow last evening and use it in preference to the oak. A short, spreading scrub kind of oak and willow are the only kind of trees I have seen in this country.

In the afternoon McCowan took his spade and I my wash pan and proceeded to the diggings. After "prospecting" a short time and washing a panful of sand without finding any gold, we moved on and struck our spade into a new place at the water's edge. From our
first panful here we took out a few small parcels of the glittering ore. We continued a little while here, washing out some four or five panfuls of sand from which I obtained about 75 cents and McCowan about 25 cents. This was our first effort at gold digging and I shall never forget the first panful of sand I washed.

This morning McCowan and I carried our wash pans and mining implements to a place about a mile and a half distant from our tent and dug, washed and sifted the earth for about six hours and then returned to camp early in order to cook some pancakes, or rather "slapjacks." I gathered about a dollar of "the dust" and McCowan not quite as much. Digging and washing in a pan is mighty hard and dirty work, and not to be laughed at; but that I anticipated, and it cannot intimidate me. A cradle is much needed by us, but as they cannot be bought for less than $50, we have to work without. Shovels second hand are worth $8 each.

This evening we were visited by a strolling band of Indians, six in number, armed with their bows and arrows and some of them almost nude, having nothing but a check shirt and cap on. They are a poor, miserable-looking set of devils, speak a very little Spanish, and were out on a begging excursion. One of our neighbors gave them beef enough for supper and breakfast. They are making the welkin ring with their loud songs, and will sleep on the ground around a large fire during the night. One of them had a piece of reed as thick as a man's finger and about five inches long, stuck through his ears as marks of renown.
