<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='24'>24th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Yesterday, we went to the Capitol grounds 
to see our returned prisoners. We walked slowly up and down until Jeff Davis was called upon to speak. There I 
stood, almost touching the bayonets when he left me. I looked straight into the prisoners faces, poor fellows. They 
cheered with all their might, and I wept for sympathy, and enthusiasm. I was very deeply moved. These men were 
so forlorn, so dried up, and shrunken, vrith such a strange look in some of their eyes ; others so restless and wild-looking ; others again placidly vacant, as if they had been dead to the world for years. A poor woman was too much for 
me. She was searching for her son. He had been expected back. She said he was taken prisoner at Gettysburg. She 
kept going in and out among them with a basket of provisions she had brought for him to eat. It was too pitiful. 
She was utterly unconscious of the crowd. The anxious dread, expectation, hurry, and hope which led her on 
showed in her face.

A sister of <a href='/results.php?tla=mtl' rel=''>Mrs. Lincoln</a> is here. She brings the freshest scandals from Yankeeland. She says she rode with 
Lovejoy. A friend of hers commands a black regiment. Two Southern horrors a black regiment and Lovejoy.
