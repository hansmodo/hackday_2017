Dear Brother : . . . I was heartily glad you got out of 
the War Department. The mission to Mexico is a very 
honorable one, and with your views on " annexation " is 
a very safe one for the country. We all hope that the 
French will go out, and that you will keep the United 
States out. We want as little to do with Mexico politically as possible, and as much trade with her as is 
profitable. She is terribly in need of a strong government, and if her mixed population would elect you or 
some other firm military ruler as emperor or king, it 
would be lucky for her, but a bad business for the elected 
one. I have never seen the elements of a stable government in Mexico, but she has physical resources that might, 
under a firm ruler, make her the second power in America. 
Self-government is out of the question. The worst 
enemies of Mexico are her own mixed, ignorant population. If Maximilian could have held on, he would have 
secured them physical prosperity ; but sooner or later the 
pride of our people aroused against European intervention would have got us into a quarrel with him. It is 
therefore best that he leave. What you can do for or 
with Mexico we will see. Your military reputation and 
aptitude with all classes may help to bring order out of 
chaos. . . .

Your reception at Havana must have been grateful, 
and the whole Mexican trip will no doubt close agreeably for you a year of trials and ovations. If they don't 
make you emperor down there, we will welcome you 
back as the " republicanizer " of the worst anarchy on 
the globe. If you establish Juarez, come away by all 
means in hot haste before the next pronunciamiento.

As for domestic matters, Congress meets to-morrow, 
very much irritated at the President. As for Butler or 
impeachment, you need not fear we shall follow the one 
or attempt the other. Johnson ought to acquiesce in the 
public judgment, agree to the amendment, and we shall 
have peace. The personal feeling grows out of the 
wholesale removal of good Union men from office. 
Campbell is as responsible for this as any man in Ohio; 
while I was under a cloud for being friendly to Johnson 
and absent from the State, they turned out all my special 
friends and put in Copperheads. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
