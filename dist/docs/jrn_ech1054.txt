TERRIBLE AFFRAY IN SONORA Reynolds & Co.'s Express Office, Sonora, Friday Night, June 2712 o'clock.
</p><p>
Eds. Alta:An extraordinary excitement is now raging in our town. Three persons have been killed and four wounded. The difficulty originated between some gamblers about an article published in the Sonora Herald. The gamblers went to the Herald office, armed with revolvers and knives, and effected an entrance. They first dragged from bed Mr. Gunn, the editor, and shot him through the head, killing him immediately. They next fired at a young man named James W. Coffroth, who, I understand assisted Mr. Gunn. He was formerly connected with a paper in New York or Philadelphia. Mr. Christman, a compositor on the paper, was also shot. Both of these individuals were instantly killed. Four persons who heard the noise and went to the persons killed, were shot in the affray. The Mayor has ordered out a large patrol of citizens, and great excitement prevails. The persons killed were universally loved and esteemed here. Mr. Gunn was a physician; Mr. Coffroth was a writer of much promise. I am writing in haste. It is now 3 o'clock,four arrests have been made of the gamblers.

I can only say in reference to this that we are yet each worth a dozen dead men. One gambler has threatened the editor with a cowhiding, but if he attempts it, a good six-shooter will probably settle him. Our
contradiction of the murder appears as follows in this morning's Sonora Herald:

Our Death, burial and resurrection!
</p><p>
Gentle readers:Since we last had the pleasure of inditing editorials, we have passed through thrilling scenes. Murdered by enemies, mourned and respectfully buried by friends, and favored since by an earlier resurrection than is allotted to mankind in general, we appear before you not with "a doleful sound" from the tombs, nor with the half-hesitating tone of one who is still compounded of flesh and blood, and who of course possesses the fears and infirmities that flesh is heir to. We are risen from the dead.It is not permitted, however, now to communicate all that we saw while absent from this little sphere. We can only say that we had glimpses of large companies of angels dancing and rejoicing over the intelligence from earth that horse thieves had been hungthat robbers, counterfeiters and murderers had been brought before a just tribunal and were then dangling in the air to be devoured by birds that feed on carrion. Being endowed by our transition into the spiritual state with vision different from that which mortals possess, we can now see men at a distance of many miles and know just what they are doing, and even read the thoughts that are running through their minds. This is the only result of the foul murder perpetrated upon our persons last Friday night and you, gentle reader, can judge whether or not now we should regret what has happened to us.Friends at least will have this consolation: Once killed, we cannot go through the same process again; and if we feel disposed now to unfold the cribs of iniquity and the authors of crime, we have the two-fold advantage of extra knowledge and of being neither vulnerable nor mortal. For those who may not understand the above allusions, we copy the letter from the Alta California, and shall take the liberty of referring the public to that and other San Francisco papers whenever hereafter they wish to obtain thrilling intelligence
respecting themselves, or those who kept us company while on the recent tour out of this world.
