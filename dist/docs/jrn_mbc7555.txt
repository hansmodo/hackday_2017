C., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Arranging my photograph book. On the first page, Colonel Watts. Here goes a sketch of his life; 
romantic enough, surely: Beaufort Watts; bluest blood; gentleman to the tips of his fingers; chivalry incarnate. 
He was placed in charge of a large amount of money, in bank bills. The money belonged to the State and he was 
to deposit it in the bank. On the way he was obliged to stay over one night. He put the roll on a table at his bed 
side, locked himself in, and slept the sleep of the righteous. Lo, next day when he awaked, the money was gone. Well ! 
all who knew him believed him innocent, of course. He 
searched and they searched, high and low, but to no purpose. The money had vanished. It was a damaging story, 
in spite of his previous character, and a cloud rested on him. 
</p><p>
Years afterward the house in which he had taken that disastrous sleep was pulled down. In the wall, behind 
the wainscot, was found his pile of money. How the rats got it through so narrow a crack it seemed hard to realize. 
Like the hole mentioned by Mercutio, it was not as deep as a well nor as wide as a church door, but it did for Beaufort 
Watts until the money was found. Suppose that house had been burned, or the rats had gnawed up the bills past recognition ? 
</p><p>
People in power understood how this proud man suffered those many years in silence. Many men looked 
askance at him. The country tried to repair the work of blasting the man's character. He was made Secretary of 
Legation to Russia, and was afterward our Consul at Santa Fe de Bogota. When he was too old to wander far 
afield, they made him Secretary to all the Governors of South Carolina in regular succession. 
</p><p>
I knew him more than twenty years ago as Secretary to the Governor. He was a made-up old battered dandy, 
the soul of honor. His eccentricities were all humored. Misfortune had made him sacred. He stood hat in hand 
before ladies and bowed as I suppose Sir Charles Grandison might have done. It was hard not to laugh at the pur 
ple and green shades of his overblack hair. He came at 
one time to show me the sword presented to Colonel Shelton for killing the only Indian who was killed in the Seminole war. We bagged Osceola and Micanopy under a flag of truce that is, they were snared, not shot on the wing. 
</p><p>
To go back to my knight-errant : he knelt, handed me the sword, and then kissed my hand. I was barely sixteen and 
did not know how to behave under the circumstances. He said, leaning on the sword, " My dear child, learn that it is 
a much greater liberty to shake hands with a lady than to 
kiss her hand. I have kissed the Empress of Russia's hand and she did not make faces at me." He looks now just as 
he did then. He is in uniform, covered with epaulettes, aigulettes, etc., shining in the sun, and with his plumed hat 
reins up his war-steed and bows low as ever. 
</p><p>
Now I will bid farewell for a while as Othello did to all the pomp, pride, and circumstance of glorious war, and 
come down to my domestic strifes and troubles. I have a sort of volunteer maid, the daughter of my husband's 
nurse, dear old Betsy. She waits on me because she so 
pleases. Besides, I pay her. She belongs to my father-in-law, who has too many slaves to care very much about their 
way of life. So Maria Whitaker came, all in tears. She brushes hair delightfully, and as she stood at my back I 
could see her face in the glass. " Maria, are you crying because all this war talk scares you? " said I. "No, 
ma am." " What is the matter with you? " " Nothing more than common." " Now listen. Let the war end 
either way and you will be free. We will have to free you before we get out of this thing. Won't you be glad? " 
" Everybody knows Mars Jeems wants us free, and it is only old Marster holds hard. He ain't going to free any 
body any way, you see. 
</p><p>
And then came the story of her troubles. " Now, Miss Mary, you see me married to Jeems Whitaker yourself. 
I was a good and faithful wife to him, and we were comfortable every way good house, everything. He had no 
cause of complaint, but he has left me." " For heaven's sake ! Why ? : " Because I had twins. He says they are 
not his because nobody named Whitaker ever had twins." 
</p><p>
Maria is proud in her way, and the behavior of this bad husband has nearly mortified her to death. She has had 
three children in two years. No wonder the man was frightened. But then Maria does not depend on him for 
anything. She was inconsolable, and I could find nothing better to say than, " Come, now, Maria ! Never mind, your 
old Missis and Marster are so good to you. Now let us look up something for the twins." The twins are named 
" John and Jeems," the latter for her false loon of a husband. Maria is one of the good colored women. She de 
served a better fate in her honest matrimonial attempt. But they do say she has a trying temper. Jeems was tried, and he failed to stand the trial.
