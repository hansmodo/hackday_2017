Dear "Pop"-<br><br>

This is where we are stopping tonight - not quite the so De Luxe as the place we stayed in Needles last night, but a bit cheaper. It is better than any we ever had in Yellowstone.<br><br>

The car is running fine and Ruth is doing most of the driving. The roads so far have been very good. There was a little rain today, but the sun came out and we got some fine views of the canyon. We'll go on in the morning as we are still a long way from Santa Fe!

I'm having the usual amount of gas, but am getting along quite well. I do the best I can on choosing food. Had some fish for supper.<br><br>

I hope everything is going well at home, and you aren't running out of clean clothes. You'll just have to buy some more if you are. Take care of yourself.<br><br>

Lots of love,<br>
Mary

[included with the letter was an advertisement/floorplan for a ranch style house remarkably like the one they ended up living in. Mary's handwritten note says: "How does this look? I like it." -HB]
