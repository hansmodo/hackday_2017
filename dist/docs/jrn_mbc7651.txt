<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. We went in a body (half a dozen ladies, 
with no man on escort duty, for they are all in the army) tou. a concert. Mrs. Pickens came in. She was joined soon by 
Secretary Moses and Mr. Follen. Doctor Berrien came to our relief. Nothing could be more execrable than the singing. Financially the thing was a great success, for though the audience was altogether feminine, it was a very large one.

Telegram from Mr. Chesnut, Safe in Richmond ; that is, if Richmond be safe, with all the power of the 
United States of America battering at her gates. Strange not a word from <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Stonewall Jackson</a>, after all! Doctor 
Gibson telegraphs his wife, "Stay where you are ; terrible battle looked for here."

Decca is dead. That poor little darling ! Immediately after her baby was born, she took it into her head that Alex 
was killed. He was wounded, but those around had not told her of it. She surprised them by asking, " Does any 
one know how the battle has gone since Alex was killed ? : She could not read for a day or so before she died. Her 
head was bewildered, but she would not let any one else touch her letters ; so she died with several unopened ones in 
her bosom. Mrs. Singleton, Decca's mother, fainted dead away, but she shed no tears. We went to the house and saw 
Alex's mother, a daughter of Langdon Cheves. Annie was with us. She said : This is the saddest thing for Alex. 
No, said his mother, "death is never the saddest thing. If he were not a good man, that would be a far worse 
thing" Annie, in utter amazement, whimpered, " But Alex is so good already. " Yes, seven years ago the death 
of one of his sisters that he dearly loved made him a Christian. That death in our family was worth a thousand lives."

One needs a hard heart now. Even old Mr. Shand shed tears. Mary Barnwell sat as still as a statue, as white and 
stony. Grief which can relieve itself by tears is a thing to pray for, said the Rev. Mr. Shand. Then came a telegram 
from Hampton, " All well; so far we are successful." Robert Barnwell had been telegraphed for. His answer 
came, " Can't leave here; Gregg is fighting across the Chickahominy. Said Alex's mother : My son, Alex, may 
never hear this sad news," and her lip settled rigidly. " Go on ; what else does Hampton say? " asked she. " <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> 
has one wing of the army, Stonewall the other.

Annie Hampton came to tell us the latest news that we have abandoned James Island and are fortifying 
Morris Island. And now, she says, i if the enemy will be so kind as to wait, we will be ready for them in two months.

Rev. Mr. Shand and that pious Christian woman, Alex's mother (who looks into your very soul with those large 
and lustrous blue eyes of hers) agreed that the Yankees, even if they took Charleston, would not destroy it. I think 
they will, sinner that I am. Mr. Shand remarked to her, " Madam, you have two sons in the army." Alex's mother 
replied, " I have had six sons in the army; I now have five."

There are people here too small to conceive of any larger business than quarreling in the newspapers. One 
laughs at squibs in the papers now, in such times as these, with the wolf at our doors. Men safe in their closets writing 
fiery articles, denouncing those who are at work, are beneath contempt. Only critics with muskets on their shoulders have the right to speak now, as Trenholm said the other night.

In a pouring rain we went to that poor child's funeral to Decca's. They buried her in the little white frock 
she wore when she engaged herself to Alex, and which she again put on for her bridal about a year ago. She 
lies now in the churchyard, in sight of my window. Is she to be pitied ? She said she had had months of perfect 
happiness. How many people can say that ? So many of us live their long, dreary lives and then happiness never 
comes to meet them at all. It seems so near, and yet it eludes them forever.
