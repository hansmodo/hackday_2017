Dear <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met friend'>General</a>,--I went down to this place since the day before
yesterday, in order to be acquainted of all the roads and grounds
around the enemy. I heard at my arrival that their main body was
between Great and Little Timber Creek since the same evening. Yesterday
morning, in reconnoitering about, I have been told that they were very
busy in crossing the Delaware. I saw them myself in their boats, and
sent that intelligence to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met friend'>General Greene</a> as soon as possible, as every
other thing I heard of. But I want to acquaint your excellency of a
little event of last evening, which, though not very considerable in
itself, will certainly please you, on account of the bravery and
alacrity a small party of ours shewed on that occasion. After having
spent the most part of the day to make myself well acquainted with the
certainty of their motions, I came pretty late into the Gloucester
road, between the two creeks. I had ten light-horse with Mr. Lindsey,
almost a hundred and fifty riflemen, under Colonel Buttler, and two
piquets of the militia, commanded by Colonels Hite and Ellis: my whole
body was not three hundred. Colonel Armand, Colonel Laumoy, the
chevaliers Duplessis and Gimat, were the Frenchmen who went with me. A
scout of my men, with whom was Mr. Duplessis, to see how near were the
first piquets from Gloucester, found at two miles and a half of it a
strong post of three hundred and fifty Hessians with field-pieces,
(what number I did know, by the unanimous deposition of their
prisoners,) and engaged immediately. As my little reconnoitering party
was all in fine spirits, I supported them. We pushed the Hessians more
than an half mile from the place where was their main body, and we made
them run very fast: British reinforcements came twice to them, but,
very far from recovering their ground, they went always back. The
darkness of the night prevented us then to push that advantage, and,
after standing upon the ground we had got, I ordered them to return
very slow to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=haddonfield" rel="city">Haddonfield</a>. The enemy, knowing perhaps by our drums that
we were not so near, came again to fire at us; but the brave Major
Moriss, with a part of his riflemen, sent them back, and pushed them
very fast. I understand that they have had between twenty-five and
thirty wounded, at least that number killed, among whom I am certain,
is an officer; some say more, and the prisoners told me they have lost
the commandant of that body; we got yet, this day, fourteen prisoners.
I sent you the most moderate account I had from themselves. We left one
single man killed, a lieutenant of militia, and only five of ours were
wounded. Such is the account of our little entertainment, which is
indeed much too long for the matter, but I take the greatest pleasure
to let you know that the conduct of our soldiers is above all praises:
I never saw men so merry, so spirited, so desirous to go on to the
enemy, whatever forces they could have, as that small party was in this
little fight. I found the riflemen above even their reputation, and the
militia above all expectations I could have: I returned to them my very
sincere thanks this morning. I wish that this little success of ours
may please you, though a very trifling one, I find it very interesting
on account of the behaviour of our soldiers.
</p><p>
Some time after I came back, General Varnum arrived here; <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met friend'>General Greene</a> is, too, in this place since this morning; he engaged me to give
you myself the account of the little advantage of that small part of
the troops under his command. I have nothing more to say to your
excellency about our business on this side, because he is writing
himself: I should have been very glad, if circumstances had permitted
me, to be useful to him upon a greater scale. As he is obliged to march
slow in order to attend his troops, and as I am here only a volunteer,
I will have the honour to wait upon your excellency as soon as
possible, and I'll set out to-day: it will be a great pleasure for me
to find myself again with you.

With the most tender affection and highest respect I have the honour to
be,

I must tell, too, that the riflemen had been the whole day running
before my horse, without eating or taking any rest.
</p><p>
I have just now a certain assurance that two British officers, besides
those I spoke you of, have died this morning of their wounds in an
house; this, and some other circumstances, let me believe that their
lost may be greater than I told to your excellency.
