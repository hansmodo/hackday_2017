At eleven o'clock A.M. the Cabinet met, this being the regular day of meeting. The subject of the Mexican War was the subject of a long and free conversation, and especially in regard to our future policy in conducting it. Mr. Buchanan repeated the opinion which upon several occasions before he had intimated, that it was bad policy to think of marching a great army upon  the City of Mexico; that if we could do so, and take that city, we would but excite a feeling against us of races and religions and would probably he as far, if not further, from a peace than we now were. His policy as he expressed it was to hold New Mexico and the Californias and defend them. He wished no more territory, but thought we ought to encourage the other northern provinces to revolt from Mexico and form an independent government of their own, and that to effect this we should furnish them aid and assistance. All the other members of the Cabinet seemed to concur in these views. The Secretary of War expressed the opinion that lie had no confidence in the success of an expedition on the City of Mexico. Mr. Walker seemed to have changed his former opinions and expressed his concurrence with the Secretaries of State and War. . . I stated that our present object was to take and possess ourselves of Vera Cruz, and that our future operations might be left to be controlled by the circumstances existing after we should have succeeded in capturing Vera Cruz.  2
