<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. In all this beautiful sunshine, in the stillness and shade of these long hours on this piazza, all comes 
back to me about little Joe; it haunts me that scene in Richmond where all seemed confusion, madness, a bad 
dream! Here I see that funeral procession as it wound among those tall white monuments, up that hillside, the 
James River tumbling about below over rocks and around islands; the dominant figure, that poor, old, gray-haired 
man, standing bareheaded, straight as an arrow, clear 
against the sky by the open grave of his son. She, the bereft mother, stood back, in her heavy black wrappings, and 
her tall figure drooped. The flowers, the children, the procession as it moved, comes and goes, but those two dark, 
sorrow-stricken figures stand ; they are before me now !

That night, with no sound but the heavy tramp of his feet overhead, the curtains flapping in the wind, the gas 
flaring, I was numb, stupid, half -dead with grief and terror. Then came Catherine's Irish howl. Cheap, was that. 
Where was she when it all happened? Her place was to have been with the child. Who saw him fall ? Whom will 
they kill next of that devoted household ?

Read to-day the list of killed and wounded. One long column was not enough for South Carolina's dead. I see 
Mr. Federal Secretary Stanton says he can reenforce Suwarrow <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant</a> at his leisure whenever he calls for more. He 
has just sent him 25,000 veterans. Old <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> says, in his quaint backwoods way, " Keep a-peggin ." Now we can 
only peg out. What have we left of men, etc., to meet these " reenforcements as often as reenforcements are called 
for? " Our fighting men have all gone to the front; only old men and little boys are at home now.

It is impossible to sleep here, because it is so solemn and still. The moonlight shines in my window sad and 
white, and the soft south wind, literally comes over a bank of violets, lilacs, roses, with orange-blossoms and magnolia 
flowers.

Mrs. Chesnut was only a year younger than her husband. He is ninety-two or three. She was deaf ; but he retains his senses wonderfully for his great age. I have always been an early riser. Formerly I often saw him sauntering slowly down the broad passage from his room to hers, in a flowing flannel dressing-gown when it was winter. In the spring he was apt to be in shirt-sleeves, with suspenders hanging down his back. He had always a large hair-brush in his hand.

He would take his stand on the rug before the fire in her room, brushing scant locks which were fleecy white. Her 
maid would be doing hers, which were dead-leaf brown, not a white hair in her head. He had the voice of a stentor, and 
there he stood roaring his morning compliments. The people who occupied the room above said he fairly shook the 
window glasses. This pleasant morning greeting ceremony was never omitted.

Her voice was " soft and low " (the oft-quoted). Philadelphia seems to have lost the art of sending forth such 
voices now. Mrs. Binney, old Mrs. Chesnut's sister, came among us with the same softly modulated, womanly, musical voice. Her clever and beautiful daughters were criarcl. Judge Han said : "Philadelphia women scream like macaws." This morning as I passed Mrs. Chesnut's room, the door stood wide open, and I heard a pitiful sound. The 
old man was kneeling by her empty bedside sobbing bitterly. I fled down the middle walk, anywhere out of reach 
of what was never meant for me to hear.
