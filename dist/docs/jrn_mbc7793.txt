<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='10'>10th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. A letter from a Pharisee who thanks the Lord she is not as other women are ; she need not pray, as 
the Scotch parson did, for a good conceit of herself. She writes, I feel that I will not be ruined. Come what may, 
God will provide for me. But her husband had strengthened the Lord's hands, and for the glory of God, doubtless, 
invested some thousands of dollars in New York, where Confederate moth did not corrupt nor Yankee bummers 
break through and steal. She went on to tell us : "I have had the good things of this world, and I have enjoyed them 
in their season. But I only held them as steward for God. My bread has been cast upon the waters and will return to me."

joy that he has no negroes to support, and need hire only those he really wants.

only binds the military, not the civil, authorities. Is our destruction to begin anew? For a few weeks we have had peace.

Sally Reynolds told a short story of a negro pet of Mrs. Kershaw's. The little negro clung to Mrs. Kershaw and 
begged her to save him. The negro mother, stronger than Mrs. Kershaw, tore him away from her. Mrs. Kershaw 
wept bitterly. Sally said she saw the mother chasing the child before her as she ran after the Yankees, whipping him 
at every step. The child yelled like mad, a small rebel blackamoor.
