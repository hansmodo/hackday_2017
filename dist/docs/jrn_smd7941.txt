Our last adieux are said, and <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> is left behind, "it may be for years, and it may be forever." 
My last hours were spent lying on the sofa on the gallery, with Lydia at my feet, Helen Carter sitting 
on the floor at my side, while all the rest were gathered around me as I played for the last time "the 
centre of attraction." I grew almost lachrymose as I bid a last adieu to the bed where I have spent so 
many months, as they carried me downstairs. Wonder if it will not miss me? It must have been 
at least five before the cars returned. Mrs. Carter grew quite pathetic as they approached, while poor 
little Lydia, with streaming eyes and choking sobs, clung first to Miriam and then to me, as though we 
parted to meet only in eternity. All except her mother started in a run for the big gate, while I was 
carried to the buggy through the group of servants gathered to say good-bye, when the General drove me off rapidly.

What a delightful sensation is motion, after five 
months inaction! The last time I was in a vehicle 
was the night General Beale's ambulance brought 
me to <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> a helpless bundle, last November. 
It seemed to me yesterday that I could again feel 
the kind gentleman's arm supporting me, and his 
wondering, sympathetic tone as he repeated every 
half-mile, "Really, Miss Morgan, you are very patient and uncomplaining!" Good, kind President 
Miller! As though all the trouble was not his, just 
then! But stopping at the gate roused me from my 
short reverie, and I opened my eyes to find myself 
stationary, and in full view of a train of cars loaded 
with soldiers, literally covered with them; for they 
covered the roof, as well as filled the interior, while 
half a dozen open cars held them, seated one above 
the other in miniature pyramids, and even the engine was graced by their presence. Abashed with 
finding myself confronted with so many people, my 
sensation became decidedly alarming as a dozen rude 
voices cried, "Go on! we won't stop!" and a chorus of the opposition cried, "Yes, we will ! " " No ! " 
"Yes!" they cried in turn, and as the General stood 
me on the ground (I would have walked if it had 
been my last attempt in life), I paused irresolute, not 
knowing whether to advance or retreat before the 
storm. I must say they are the only rude soldiers 
I have yet seen in Confederate uniforms. But as I 
walked slowly, clinging to the General's arm, half 
from fear, and half from weakness, they ceased the unnecessary dispute, and remained so quiet that I was 
more frightened still, and actually forgot to say good 
bye to Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Worley as they stood 
by the road. How both the General and I escaped 
being hurt as he raised me on the platform, every 
one is at a loss to account for. I experienced only 
what may be called slight pain, in comparison to 
what I have felt; but really fear that the exertion has 
disabled him for to-day. It must have been very severe. Some officers led me to my seat, Lilly, Miriam, 
and Anna got in, the General kissed us heartily, 
with damp eyes and kind wishes; the cars gave a 
whistle, and I put my head out of the window to see 
Mrs. Carter industriously applying white cambric to 
her face, which occupation she relinquished to call 
out last good-byes; another whistle and a jerk, and 
we were off, leaving her and Mrs. Worley, surrounded by children and servants, using their hand 
kerchiefs to wipe tears and wave farewell, while the 
General waved his hat for good-bye. Then green 
hedges rapidly changing took their place, and <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> was out of sight before we had ceased saying 
and thinking, God bless the kind hearts we had left 
behind. Can I ever forget the kindness we have met 
among them?

To see green trees and wild flowers once more, 
after such an illness, is a pleasure that only those 
long deprived of such beauties by a similar misfortune can fully appreciate.

It was a relief to discover that what I had thought 
shocking rudeness in the soldiers had not been reserved for me alone. For every time we stopped, the 
same cry of "No waiting for slow people" was 
raised, varied by constant expostulations with the 
engine for drinking ponds dry, and mild suggestions 
as to taking the road the other side of the fence, 
which would no doubt prove smoother than the 
track. These Arkansas troops have acquired a reputation for roughness and ignorance which they seem 
to cultivate as assiduously as most people would their virtues. But rudeness does not affect their 
fighting qualities.
