We arrived here about five last evening, and, 
strange to say, the journey, fatiguing as it was, has 
not altogether disabled me. But I must go back to 
<a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> to account for this new change. It would 
never do to take more than a hundred miles at a 
single jump without speaking of the incidents by the 
way. Numerous and pleasant as they were, some 
way they have unaccountably paled; and things 
that seemed so extremely amusing, and afforded me 
so much pleasure during these four days, now seem 
to be absurd trifles half forgotten. 
</p><p>
I now remember lying in state on Lilly's bed 
Wednesday, talking to Mrs. Badger (who had been 
several days in town), Anna, Sarah Ripley, and the 
others, when Frank suddenly bolted in, just from 
Port Hudson, to say another good-bye, though I told 
him good-bye at <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> Sunday. Presently the 
General entered, just from Lin wood, to see us off; 
then Mr. Mars ton and his daughter, and Mr. Neafus, all as kind as possible, until a perfect levee 
was assembled, which I, lying all dressed with a 
shawl thrown over me, enjoyed all the more as I 
could take my ease, and have my fun at the same 
time. Frank, sitting by my pillow, talked dolorously 
of how much he would miss us, and threatened to be 
taken prisoner before long in order to see us again. 
When we were finally left alone, I fancy there was 
very little sleep in the house. As to me, I lay by Lilly 
wide awake, thinking how lonely she would be with 
out us, and perfectly desolSe at the idea of leaving the 
Confederacy (the dear gray coats included) ; so when 
it was almost sunrise there was no necessity of rousing me to dress, as I was only too glad to leave my 
sleepless bed. Before I got dressed, Anna, her mother, 
and Sarah Ripley came in again; then Miss Cornstock; and just as I had put the last touch to my 
dress, the gentlemen of the night before entered, and 
we had almost an hour and a half's respite before 
the carriage, less punctual than we, drove to the 
door. 
</p><p>
The General picked me up in his arms and carried 
me once more to the carriage. Then the servants 
had to say good-bye; then Lilly, very quiet, very 
red, and dissolved in tears, clung to me almost with 
out a word, hardly able to speak, whilst I, distressed 
and grieved as I was, had not a tear in my eyes - nothing but a great lump in my throat that I tried 
to choke down in order to talk to Frank, who stood 
at the window by me, after she left. . . . How the 
distance lengthens between us! I raise up from my 
pillows and find myself at Camp Moore at four 
o clock. Forty miles are passed over; good-bye, Frank ! 
</p><p>
From Camp Moore we had to go three miles back, 
to find Captain Gilman's house where we were expected. The gentleman is a friend of Gibbes, though 
I had never seen any of them before. Such a delightful place, with everything looking so new, and cool, 
and such a hospitable hostess that I thought every 
thing charming in spite of my fatigue. I had hardly 
a moment to look around ; for immediately we were 
shown to our rooms, and in a very few minutes 
Miriam had me undressed and in bed, the most 
delightful spot in the world to me just then. While 
congratulating myself on having escaped death on 
the roadside, I opened my eyes to behold a tray 
brought to my bedside with a variety of refreshments. Coffee! Bread! Loaf-sugar! Preserves! I 
opened my mouth to make an exclamation at the singular optical illusion, but wisely forbore speaking, 
and shut it with some of the unheard-of delicacies instead. . . . 
</p><p>
Early next morning the same routine was gone 
through as Thursday morning. Again the carriage 
drove to the door, and we were whisked off to Camp Moore, where the engine stood snorting with impatience to hurry us off to Ponchatoula. . . . Soon we 
were steaming down the track, I reclining on my 
pillows in an interesting state of invalidism, sadly 
abashed now and then at the courteous, wondering 
gaze of the soldiers who were aboard. Having very 
little idea of the geography of that part of the country, and knowing we were to take a carriage from 
some point this side of Ponchatoula, fancying how 
surprised Mr. Halsey would be to hear we had 
passed him on the way, I took a card from my travel 
ing-case, and wrote a few words for " good-bye," 
as we could not see him again. I sealed it up, and 
put it in my pocket to send to the first post-office we passed. 
</p><p>
About twelve o'clock we stopped at Hammond, 
which was our place to disembark. Mother sent out 
to hire a negro to carry me off the platform ; and while 
waiting in great perplexity, a young officer who had 
just seated himself before me, got up and asked if he 
could assist her, seizing an arm full of cloaks as he 
spoke. I got up and walked to the door to appear 
independent and make believe I was not the one, 
when mother begged him not to trouble himself ; she 
wanted a man to assist her daughter who was sick. 
Calling a friend, the gentleman kindly loaded him 
with the cloaks, etc., while he hurried out after me. 
I was looking ruefully at the impracticable step 
which separated me from the platform. The question of how I was to carry out my independent notions began to perplex me. "Allow me to assist you," 
said a voice at my elbow. I turned and beheld the 
handsome officer. " Thank you; I think I can get 
down alone." "Pray allow me to lift you over this 
place." "Much obliged, but your arm will suffice." 
"Sarah, let the gentleman carry you ! You know you 
cannot walk!" said my very improper mother. I 
respectfully declined the renewed offer. " don't pay 
any attention to her. Pick her up, just as you would 
a child," said my incorrigible mother. The gentleman turned very red, while Miriam asserts I turned 
extremely white. The next thing I knew, by passing 
his arm around my waist, or taking me by my arms 
- I was so frightened that I have but a confused 
idea of it I was lifted over the intervening gulf 
and landed on the platform! 
</p><p>
Hammond boasts of four houses. One, a shoe 
manufactory, stood about twenty or thirty yards off, 
and there the gentleman proposed to conduct me. 
Again he insisted on carrying me; and resolutely 
refusing, I pronounced myself fully equal to the 
walk, and accepting his proffered arm, walked off 
with dignity and self-possession. He must have 
fancied that the injury was in my hand; for holding 
my arm so that my entire weight must have been 
thrown on him, not satisfied with that support, with 
his other hand he held mine so respectfully and so 
carefully that I could not but smile as it struck 
me, which, by the way, was not until I reached the 
house / 
</p><p>
Discovering that he belonged to Colonel Simonton's command, I asked him to take Mr. Halsey the 
note I had written an hour before. He pronounced 
himself delighted to be of the slightest service, and 
seeing that we were strangers, traveling unprotected, asked if we had secured a conveyance to 
take us beyond. We told him no. He modestly suggested that some gentleman might attend to it for 
us. He would be happy to do anything in his power. 
I thought again of Mr. Halsey, and said if he would 
mention we were in Hammond, he would be kind 
enough to see to it for us. " May I ask your name? " 
he asked, evidently surprised to find himself asking a 
question he was dying to know. I gave him my card, 
whereupon mother asked his name, which he told 
us was Howard. We had been talking for some ten 
minutes, when feeling rather uncomfortable at being 
obliged to look up at such a tall man from my low 
seat, to relieve my neck as well as to shade my face 
from any further scrutiny, I put down my head while 
I was still speaking. Instantly, so quietly, naturally, 
and unobtrusively did he stoop down by me, on one 
knee so that his face was in full view of mine, that 
the action did not seem to me either singular or impertinent in fact, I did not think of it until mother 
spoke of it after he left. After a few moments it 
must have struck him ; for he got up and made his 
parting bow, departing, as I afterwards heard, to 
question Tiche as to how I had been hurt, and declaring that it was a dreadful calamity to happen to so "lovely " a young lady.
