I sent you a copy of my speech in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. I delivered it with credit and to a very large and kind audience. 
Upon looking it over, I perceive a good deal of bitterness, 
natural enough, but which you will not approve. It is 
well received here.

Affectionately yours, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jos" rel="me">John Sherman</a>.
