HONORED MADAM : 
</p><p>
I embrace with pleasure an opportunity of complying with the request, 
you made me when I left Santee, of transmitting such intelligence as I 
thought worthy your notice, though the presence of our active officers 
(General Moultrie and Col. Pinckney) renders the subject somewhat 
barren. My cousin and the General returned to town on Tuesday by 
desire of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>Gen. Lincoln</a>, who was of opinion that unless the assembly 
took some effectual measures to oblige the militia to do their duty, and 
placed them under the same articles as those from North Carolina, our 
situation would soon be discouraging, even to those who had voluntarily 
resigned their lives and fortunes, in our defence, though at a great distance from danger and who were merely actuated upon this occasion by 
a love to their country. They opened the matter very fully; related 
several facts of which we were ignorant; were exceedingly warm; and 
roused the spirit as well as the indignation of the House so much at the 
conduct of their fellow-citizens, that notwithstanding they had, some 
little time before, reprobated the idea of subjecting the militia to martial law, yet an Ordinance being prepared and brought in for that 
purpose passed both Houses without opposition. The reluctance of our 
militia to continue at Purysburgh longer than the 1st of March, frustrated one of the best laid schemes, that our affairs have yet given Gen. 
Lincoln an opportunity of concerting. A detachment of the enemy 
having taken possession of <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, Gen. Ash was immediately detached 
to reinforce Gen. Williamson; these corps when joined consisted of 
between two and three thousand men. Gen. Moultrie was ordered to 
march with his division, consisting of 1,600 Continentals and some 
regiments of militia; and had he occupied the post to which he was 
ordered and was then proceeding to, the enemy would have been completely surrounded and either obliged to hazard a battle on the disadvantageous terms of three to one or have surrendered themselves prisoners of war but after marching six or eight miles up the river for this 
purpose, he received an order from <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>Gen. Lincoln</a> to return to his former 
post; but I am happy in acquainting you that our officers pledge 
themselves, that they will, with the assistance of only a small part 
of our militia, free Georgia from the present invasion ; indeed, the 
enemy themselves confess that they have erred in not marching immediately to Charlestown, after the rout at <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>; and the late precipitate retreat from <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, where they left their Hospital, with a letter 
recommending their sick and wounded to the care and humanity of 
Gen. Williamson, convinces me that they either mean to evacuate 
Georgia very soon, or to confine themselves to <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> and its 
environs but it is u matter of doubt with me, whether they will be 
even able to maintain their post there, as I am informed that the reinforcement which G. M. carries with him, will enable our forces to 
act offensively. Lincoln is anxious and uneasy at being obliged from 
the enemy's superiority, or at least equality of numbers, to remain so 
long inactive, and will assuredly take the first opportunity of paying 
them a visit. The long expected express from the northward arrived on 
Monday. Messrs. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Laurens</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=wid' rel='colleague'>Drayton</a> acquaint us that it is impossible to spare any Continental troops, as a secret expedition now on the 
carpet, will demand their whole force. They say that Congress in con 
sequence of our application, have granted us every assistance in their 
power, and refer the Governor to the President's letter on that subject, 
which has not yet come to hand. As to a further aid from North Carolina, they have agreed to send us 2,000 more men immediately. We 
have now upwards of 3,000 of their men with us; and I esteem this last 
augmentation, as the highest possible mark of their affection for us and 
as the most convincing proof of their zeal for the glorious cause in which 
they are engaged ; they have been so willing and ready upon all occa 
sions to afford us all the assistance in their power, that I shall ever love a North Carolinian, and join with Gen. Moultrie in confessing that they 
have been the salvation of this country. 
</p><p>
I expect <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Col. Horry</a> will be in town in a few days, as he was on Friday last elected Colonel of a Regiment of light dragoons, which are to 
be immediately raised for the public service. Maharn is Major there 
was an opposition in favor of Major Huger, but by no means a serious 
one, as the Colonel carried it by a majority of 44; Huger will soon be 
promoted in the Continental service as a Commission arrived yesterday 
appointing Col. Huger, a Brigadier General. 
</p><p>
There is almost a total stagnation of every kind of business; and we 
daily expect a Proclamation from the Governor and Council for stopping 
the Courts of Justice and prohibiting all commercial proceedings what 
soever until the removal of the enemy from Georgia. The people of 
this country were scarcely roused to a sense of their danger, till within 
this fortnight, but I believe I may now venture to assert that Carolina, 
will in a short time (comparatively speaking) be as tenacious of her 
freedom and as forward in defending her liberties as any State on the 
continent, though, from her internal disputes and natural weakness, 
she may not be able to bring as many men into the field. Our town, 
once the seat of pleasure and amusement, is now dull and insipid; a 
sameness prevails through every thing, and the duty of the remaining 
militia is full as fatiguing as that of the regulars. We have very few 
men left here, notwithstanding which they are daily reducing us, and 
should a fleet and army appear at our bar, God knows what we should 
do. If the enemy should prove unable to penetrate into this State, and 
I can get leave (for no one is suffered to leave the town without it under 
a heavy fine) I purpose paying you a visit at Santee for a few days. I 
am fond of variety, and changing the scene now and then is I think 
very agreeable. I hope the little bantling and my friend Daniel are 
well. Should the weather continue good, my uncle and family will be 
at Santee on Thursday. I shall expect an answer from you by your next 
express, and you may depend upon my writing you as often as I can find 
a conveyance for a letter. My compliments to Miss Howarth and our 
Santee friends (in which my mother joins me). Conclude me 
Your affectionate nephew, 
</p><p>

P. S. Mr. Bee being elected Lieutenant-General, and E. Rutledge 
refusing to go to Congress, Mr. Lowndes and <a href='/results.php?tla=wid' rel='colleague'>William Henry Drayton</a> 
(who carried it against Daniel Huger by one vote) were elected in their 
room.
