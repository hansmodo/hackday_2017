SIR I have received the letter you did me the honour to write to me, on the twenty-third of October, with the resolve enclosed therein. Be so good, sir, as to present 
my duty to the Senate, and assure that honourable body that I feel, as I ought to do, the highest sense of obligation, for the honour conferred upon me, by the manner 
in which they have been pleased to express their sense of my services, and for the obliging wish, they have expressed, for the future happiness of my life. I wish it 
may be the good fortune of those who follow me, to serve masters willing to crown their labours, by bestowing upon them a reward so respectable as I have been favoured with. 
</p><p>
I thank you, sir, for the kind manner of conveying to me the sense of the Senate; and I remain, with the highest respect, sir, your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rhl" rel="me">RICHARD HENRY LEE</a>, 
</p><p>
Honourable the Speaker of the Senate.
