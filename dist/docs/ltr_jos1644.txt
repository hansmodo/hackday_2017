My Dear Brother : Your letter of March 20th has been 
received by me upon my return from Kansas. Your 
notions about the slavery question are in common with 
my own. In accepting the appointment to go to Kansas, 
I was left free to follow my own judgment and form my 
own opinions about the disturbances there. These opinions are embodied in the Report of the Committee, all of 
which I wrote, a copy of which I will send to you as soon 
as it is printed. You will see that the condition of affairs 
in that territory are far worse than you anticipated. 
Please give me your opinion frankly as to the character 
of the report. 
</p><p>
I do not think that the Pacific Railroad will pass this 
Session. A liberal appropriation will be made, I think, 
to construct a wagon road. This will be the best plan 
for the present, and I will therefore cordially support it. 
</p><p>
I saw your name connected with the disturbances in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san francisco" rel="city">San Francisco</a>. Please inform me all about it. I shall 
feel disposed to favor appropriations to California, Oregon, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and especially to make communications between them and older States, but the sums 
you ask rather startle our economical notions. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother, 
</p><p>
