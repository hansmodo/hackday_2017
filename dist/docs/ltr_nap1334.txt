MY DEAR MOTHER I have been thinking of my beloved Parents this evening, of the parting scene & the probability that I shall never see those dear faces again while I live. Sweet as it used to be, when my heart was full to sit down & pour into my mother's bosom all my feelings, both sad & rejoycing, now when far away from the parental roof & thirsting for the same precious privaledge, I take my pen & find a sweet relief in giving her my history in the same familiar way. Perhaps no one else feels as I do. It would be indeed a great satisfaction to me to have my mother know how I do from day to day what my employment & prospects are, but more especially the kind dealings of my heavenly Father towards us continually.

We left Vancouver Thursday noon Nov 3rd in two boats. Mr McLeod myself & baggage in one & Mr and Mrs S in the other. We were well provided for in everything we could wish, good boats, with strong & faithful men to manage them. Indeed eight of them were Iroquois Indians from Montreal, men accostomed to the water from their childhood & well acquainted with the dangers of this river. Mr McLeod's accompany us was as unexpected as desireable. He only came into Vancouver two days previous to our leaving from an expedition to the Umpaquai [Umpqua] south of the Willamut. It rained some that afternoon, also on the fourth & fifth. Sixth it rained all day, nearly, & the wind was very strong, but in our favour, so that we kept our sail up  most of the day. Our boat was well covered with an oil cloth. I succeeded in keeping myself dry by wrapping well in my cloak & getting under the oil cloth. At night when a great fire was made our tents pitched & the cloth spread for tea, all was pleasant & comfortable. I roll'd my bed & blankets in my India Rubber cloak which preserved them quite well from the rain, so that nights I slept warm & comfortably as ever. My fether bed was of essential service to me in keeping my health during this rainy voyage, did not expect to get one when I wrote from Vancouver.
</p><p>
On the morning of the Seventh we arrived at the Cascades made the portage & breakfasted, had considerable rain. The men towed the boats up the falls on the opposite side of the river. The water was very low & made it exceeding difficult for them to drag the boats up in the midst of the rocks, & noise of the foaming waters. Sometimes they were obliged to lift the boats over the rocks, at others go round them to the entire destruction of the gum upon them which prevents them from leaking. It was nearly night before all was safely over the difficult passage & our boats gumed ready for launching. 
</p><p>
8th breakfasted just below the Dalls, past them without unloading the boats. This was done by attaching a strong rope of considerable length to the Stern of the boat, two men only remaining in it to guide & keep it clear of the rocks, while the remainder & as many Indians as can be obtained draw it along with the rope, walking upon the edge of the rocks, above the freightful precipice. The little Dalls just above these the current is exceeding strong & rapid & full of whirlpools. Not recollecting the place particularly at the request of the bowsman I remained in the boat being quite fatigued with my walk past the other Dalls. It is a terrific sight, & a frightful place to be in, to be drawn along in such a narrow channel between such high craggy perpendicular bluffs, the men with the rope, clambering sometimes upon their hands & knees upon the very edge so high above us as to appear small, like boys. Many times the rope would catch against the rocks & oblige some one to creep carefully over the horrible precipice to unloose it much to the danger of his life.
</p><p>
When my Husband came up in passing this place, their rope caught in a place so difficult of access, that no one would venture his life to extricate it for some time. At last an Indian ventured. When he had ascended sufficiently to unfasten it he was unable to return & did not untill he was drawn up by a rope. They had another accident which threatened both the lives of some of them & the property & but for the protecting hand of God would have been lost. While the men with the rope were climbing up a steep & difficult ascent the rope lodged upon a rock which held it fast & had it remained there untill all hands
had gained their point & commenced hauling, all would have been well, but one of the men above, prematurely shoved it off. The current took the boat down stream rapidly in spite of every effort to save it prostrating all hands upon the rocks & some of them were nearly precipitated down the precipice by the rope. The boat received no injury but was safely moored below the Dallas, on the opposite shore. Our husbands with the men obtained an Indian canoe & crossed to the boat thus they were preserved. It was just night as we succeeded in passing this difficult place in safety, for which we desired to be greatful. Many boats have been dashed to pieces at these places & more than a hundred lives lost. The water was very low at this time which makes the danger much less in passing them. No rain today.

Thursday we made the portage of the Chutes & were all day about it. While on land had several heavy showers. Friday also was another soaking wet day, the night also. This was dreary enough. Saturday was much more pleasant no rain. We arrived at Walla W early Sab Morning in health with all our effects preserved to us mercifully.  I felt that I had great cause to bless & praise God for so seasonable return, & under such favorable circumstances. Husband came from our location on the 18th had nearly succeeded in makeing a comfortable place for me, but because of Mr Pambran earnest solicitation for me to remain a few weeks with his family I did not return with him. Mr & Mrs P are exceeding kind appear to feel that they cannot do to much to make us contented & happy here. In the mean time I am cheerfully engaged in teaching the wife & daughter to read. We consider it a very kind Providence to be situated near one family so interesting & a native female that promises to be so much society for me. She is learning to speak the English language quite fast.

Mr & Mrs S left W W for their location on the 22d Nov. Mr Gray going with them to assist in building &c. This dear Sister goes very cheerfully to her location to live in a skin lodge untill her house is built & this too in the dead of winter, but she prefers it to remaining here & so should I.  Heard from Husband last week & of the death of Hinds a coulered man, who came with us from Rendezvous on account of his health being far gone with Dropsy. Already death has entered our house & laid one low.
</p><p>
DEC 8th Received inteligence that Husband was coming tomorrow to remove our effects & myself to our new home. It is an agreeable thought to be so near a fixed location after journeying so long.
</p><p>
DEC 26th Where are we now? & who are we that we should be thus blessed of the Lord. I can scarcely realize that we are thus com fortably fixed & keeping house so soon after our marriage when considering what was then before us. We arrived here on the tenth distance twenty five miles from W W found a house reared & the lean too enclosed, a good chimney & fire place & the floor laid. No windows or door except blankets. My heart truly leaped for joy as I alighted from my horse entered and seated myself before a pleasant fire (for it was now night). It occurred to me that my dear Parents had made a similar beginning & perhaps more difficult one than ours.
</p><p>
We have neither straw bedstead nor table nor anything to make them of except green cottonwood all our boards are sawed by hand. Here my Husband with his labourers (two Owyhees from Vancouver & a man who crossed the mountains with us) & Mr Gray have been encamped in tents since the 19th of Oct. toiling excessively hard to accomplish this much for our comfortable residence during the remainder of the winter. It is indeed a lovely situation. We are on a beautiful level, a peninsula, formed by the branches of the W W river, upon the base of which, our house stands, on the S.E. corner near the shore of the main River. To run a fence across to the opposite river on the North, from our house this with the rivers would enclose 300 acres of good land for cultivation, all directly under the eye. The rivers are barely skirted with timber, this is all the wood land we can see, beyond them as far as the eye can reach plains & mountains appear. On the east a few rods from the house is a range of small hills  covered with bunch grass, a very excellent food for animals & upon which they subsist during winter even digging it from under the snow. Beyond these hills are the Blue Mountains. The history of our ride across them, I gave you in my letters from Vancouver. We are about half a days ride from them. There is more good land here for cultivation than at Mr. S. location, but he has the best timber & a plenty of it.

Friday the 16th Mr Pambran sent us a table & window sashes which he kindly offered to get made for us. The sashes were made with a crooked knife by a frenchman. I have taken the liberty to prime them & set some of the lights, & while engaged in it thought a great deal about Father, how handily he used to do such work, & could have wish him here to assist in many things difficult & perplexing to hands unacquainted & which he would accomplish with so much ease. How much work of every description is to be done on Mission ground & that too by but a few hands. When I came here there was no snow except in the Blue Mountains & the weather has been quite mild & pleasant. It commenced snowing on the 16th & fell about a foot & half deep & remains yet on the ground & it has been quite cold. Last Saturday all our windows were finished & put up. Now they are engaged in makeing partitions for two bed rooms & pantry.
