MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I will now give you some account of my late tour 
to Bath, that seat of fashionable resort, where, like 
the rest of the world, I spent a fortnight in amusement and dissipation, but returned, I assure you, 
with double pleasure to my own fireside, where 
only, thank Heaven, my substantial happiness subsists. Here I find that satisfaction, which neither 
satiates by enjoyment, nor palls upon reflection ; for, 
though I like sometimes to mix in the gay world, 
and view the manners as they rise, I have much 
reason to be grateful to my parents, that my early 
education gave me not an habitual taste for what is 
termed fashionable life. The Eastern monarch, 
after having partaken of every gratification and 
sensual pleasure, which power, wealth, and dignitycould bestow, pronounced it all vanity and vexation 
of spirit ; and I have too great a respect for his 
wisdom to doubt his authority. I, however, passed 
through the routine, and attended three balls, two 
concerts, one play, and two private parties, besides 
dining and breakfasting abroad. We made up a 
party of Americans ; Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Mr. and 
Mrs. Rucker, and Miss Ramsay, Mr. Shippen, Mr. 
Harrison, Mr. Murray, Mr. Paradise, Mr. Bridgen, 
and a Count Zenobia, a Venetian nobleman. These, 
with our domestics, made a considerable train, and 
when we went to the rooms, we at least had a party 
to speak to. As I had but one acquaintance at 
Bath, and did not seek for letters of introduction, 
I had no reason to expect half the civility 1 experienced. I was, however, very politely treated by Mr. 
Fairfax and his lady, who had been in America, 
and own an estate in Virginia, and by a sister of Mr. 
Hartley's, who, though herself a cripple, was every 
way attentive and polite to us. Mr. John Boylston, 
whom I dare say you recollect, was the acquaintance 
I mentioned. He visited us immediately upon our 
arrival, and during our stay made it his whole study 
to show us every civility in his power. We breakfasted with him, and he dined with us. He has 
very handsome apartments, though he lives at lodgings. We drank tea and spent an evening with 
him, in a style of great elegance ; for he is one of 
the nicest bachelors in the world, and bears his age 
wonderfully, retaining the vivacity and sprightliness 
of youth. He has a peculiarity in his manners, 
which is natural to him ; but is a man of great reading and knowledge. He is a firm friend and wellwisher to America, as he amply testified during the 
war by his kindness to the American prisoners.

And now you will naturally expect that I should 
give you some account of Bath, the antiquity of it, 
and the fame of its waters, having been so greatly 
celebrated. The story, which is related of its first 
discovery, is not the least curious part of it. A 
certain King Bladud, said to be a descendant from 
Hercules, was banished his father's court, on account of his having the leprosy. Thus disgraced, 
he wandered in disguise into this part of the country, and let himself to a swine-herd, to whom he 
communicated the disease, as well as to the hogs. 
In driving his hogs one day at some distance from 
his home, they wandered away to one of these 
streams, of which they were so fond that he could 
not get them out, until he enticed them with acorns. 
After their wallowing in them for several successive 
days, he observed that their scales fell off, and that 
his herd were perfectly cured. Upon which he determined to try the experiment upon himself; and, 
after a few bathings, he was made whole. And 
Bladud's figure, in stone, is placed in the bath known 
by the name of the King's Bath, with an inscription 
relating his discovery of these baths, eight hundred 
and sixty-three years before Christ.

Bath lies in a great valley, surrounded with hills. 
It is handsomely built, chiefly with free-stone, which 
is its own growth, and is dug from the sides of its 
hills. The streets are as narrow and inconvenient 
for carriages as those of Paris, so that chairs are 
chiefly used, particularly in the old town. Bath 
was formerly walled in, and was a very small 
place ; but of late years it is much extended, and 
the new buildings are erected upon hills. Since it 
has become a place of such fashionable resort, it 
has been embellished with a Circus and a Crescent. 
The Parades are magnificent piles of buildings, the 
square is a noble one, and the Circus is said to be a 
beautiful piece of architecture ; but what I think the 
beauty of Bath, is the Crescent. The front consists 
of a ran^e of Ionic columns on a rustic basement ; 
the ground falls gradually before it down to the river 
Avon, about half a mile's distance, and the rising 
country on the other side of the river holds up to it a 
most delightful prospect. The Crescent takes its 
name from the form in which the houses stand ; all 
of which join. There is a parade and street before 
them, a hundred feet wide, and nothing in front to 
obstruct this beautiful prospect. In this situation 
are the new assemblv-rooms, w r hich are said to 
exceed any thing of the kind in the kingdom, both 
as to size and decoration ; but, large as they are, 
they Were completely crowded the evenings that I 
attended. There is a constant emulation subsisting 
between the new and old rooms, similar to the North 
and South Ends of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. It was said whilst I was 
there, that there were fourteen thousand persons 
more than the inhabitants of Bath. By this you 
may judge what a place of resort it is, not only for 
the infirm, but for the gay, the indolent, the curious, 
the gambler, the fortune-hunter, and even for those 
who go, as the thoughtless girl from the country told 
Beau Nash, (as he was styled,) that she came, out 
of wantonness. It is one constant scene of dissipation and gambling, from Monday morning till Saturday night, and the ladies sit down to cards in the 
public rooms as they would at a private party ; and 
not to spend a fortnight or a month at Bath at this 
season of the year, is as unfashionable as it would 
be to reside in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> during the summer season. 
Yet Bath is a place I should never visit a second 
time for pleasure. To derive a proper improvement 
from company, it ought to be select, and to consist 
of persons respectable both for their morals and 
their understanding ; but such is the prevailing taste, 
that, provided you can be in a crowd, with here and 
there a glittering star, it is considered of little importance what the character of the person is who 
wears it. Few consider that the foundation stone, 
and the pillar on which they erect the fabric of 
their felicity, must be in their own hearts, otherwise 
the winds of dissipation will shake it, and the floods 
of pleasure overwhelm it in ruins. What is the 
chief end of man ? is a subject well worth the investigation of every rational being. What, indeed, 
is life, or its enjoyments, without settled principle, 
laudable purposes, mental exertions, and internal 
comfort, that sunshine of the soul; and how are 
these to be acquired in the hurry and tumult of the 
world ? My visit to Bath, and the scenes which I 
mixed in, instead of exciting a gayety of disposition, 
led me into a train of moral reflections, which I could 
not refrain from detailing to you in my account of it. 
</p><p>
Upon my return, I had a new scene of folly to go 
through, which was, preparing for the birth-day. 
But as the fashionable Magazine will detail this 
matter, I shall omit any account of birth-day dresses 
and decorations, only that I most sincerely wish 
myself rid of it. It is a prodigious expense, from 
which I derive neither pleasure nor satisfaction. 
</p><p>
The riots and dissensions in our State have been 
matter of very serious concern to me. No one will 
suppose that our situation here is rendered more 
eligible in consequence of it ; but I hope it will lead 
the wise and sensible part of the community in our 
State, as well as in the whole Union, to reflect 
seriously upon their situation, and, having wise laws, 
to execute them with vigor, justice, and punctuality. 
I have been gratified with perusing many late publications in our <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> papers ; particularly the 
speech of the Chief Justice, which does him great 
honor. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>, you will see by the books 
which Captain Gushing has carried out, has been 
employed in strengthening and supporting our governments, and has spared no pains to collect examples for them, and show them, in one short, comprehensive statement, the dangerous consequences of 
unbalanced power. We have the means of being 
the first and the happiest people upon the globe. 
Captain Scott, I hear, is just arrived ; but it may 
be a week, perhaps ten days, before he will get 
up himself, so that, whatever letters he may have, 
I shall not be able to get them before Captain dishing sails. This is rather unfortunate, as there may 
be something I might wish to reply to. As to India handkerchiefs, I give two guineas a-piece here 
for them, so that they are lower with you, as well 
as all other India goods. I give more for an ounce 
of spice than I used to do for a quarter of a pound in 
America. Only think, too, of five shillings sterling 
for every pound of coffee we use ! O, pray, by the 
next opportunity, send me a peck of Tuscarora rice. 
Let it be sifted. I want it only to scour my hands 
with. "Tuscarora rice?" say you, "why, I suppose she means Indian meal." Very true, my dear 
sister ; but I will tell you a good story about this 
said rice. An ancestor of a family, who now hold 
their heads very high, is said to have made a fortune 
by it. The old grand-dame went out to America, 
when its productions were not much known here, 
and returned in rather indigent circumstances. After some time, knowing the taste in all ages for 
cosmetics, she made out a pompous advertisement 
of a costly secret which she possessed for purifying 
and beautifying the complexion, nothing less than 
the " Tuscarora rice " at a guinea an ounce. The 
project took like the " Olympian dew " at this day, 
and barrel after barrel was disposed of at the moderate price before mentioned, till one fatal day, a sailor, 
whose wife had procured one quarter of an ounce, was caught in the very act of using it. The sailor 
very roughly threw away the darling powder, upon 
which his wife exclaimed that he had ruined her, as 
she could procure no more, there being an unusual 
scarcity at that time. The fellow examined the 
paper, and swore it was nothing but Indian meal, and 
that he would bring her two barrels for a guinea, the 
next voyage he went. Upon this, the imposture was 
discovered, and the good woman obliged to decamp. 
Now, though I do not esteem it so highly as the 
sailor's wife, I pronounce it the best antidote to seacoal black, that can be found. One friend and 
another have supplied me ever since I have been 
here, but now I am quite destitute. It is an article in 
so small quantity, that it will not be an object for the 
custom-house, so that it may come safely. 
</p><p>
Remember me most affectionately to all my 
friends. I cannot write to half of them ; my nieces 
shall hear from me by Raimond ; in the mean time 
be assured, mv dear sister, of the warmest affection 
of 
</p><p>
Your sister,
