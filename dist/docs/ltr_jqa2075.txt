TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 39 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, May 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have now the honor of inclosing a paper, containing 
the substance of the articles forming the treaty signed on the 
morning of the iyth instant, between the French Representatives Sieyes and Rewbell and the deputies from the 
States General, Paulus, Lestevenon, Pons and Huber. 
</p><p>
The event serves to confirm the observation I have made in my preceding letters, that whatever terms might be 
exacted on the part of France would eventually be consented to in this country. 
</p><p>
The terms of this treaty are as advantageous to France 
and as burdensome to this people as the possibility of execution will admit. But from the habits and feelings of the 
persons composing the present administration, Maestricht, 
Venlo, Dutch Flanders and one hundred millions of florins, 
arc no object in comparison with the danger of a Stadtholder. 
The point respecting the command of the ships of war appears to have been abandoned ; the French captains who had 
arrived at Rotterdam have returned. By the treaty the 
stipulation only purports that in case of combined operations the commander shall be French. It is somewhat 
questionable whether the engagement to furnish during this campaign twelve ships of the line and eighteen frigates for 
the North Sea and the Baltic will be practicable. 
</p><p>
It is hardly supposable that this treaty will fail of obtaining an immediate ratification by the French National Convention. The great object of internal policy represented in 
a statement dated February 27, to which I beg leave to refer, 
may be considered as effected. The internal object, the 
calling of a National Convention to form a constitution of 
government for the Batavian people, may now be pursued. 
It is to be presumed that it will meet with the earliest 
attention, but whether the plan of completing this business 
immediately will prevail, or that of postponing these political arrangements until a time of peace and tranquility will 
be preferred, is yet to be ascertained. The Treaty makes 
this country a party to the war with France against the 
combined powers. The country is exhausted, and yet the most extraordinary exertions are required of it. Perhaps it 
will be concluded that the exigencies of the times demand 
action more than deliberation, and the formation of a constitution will be deferred till a calmer and less critical time. 
The pecuniary payment stipulated by one of the articles 
cannot be made in the present exhausted state of the national finances without the adoption of some extraordinary 
measures. There are some appearances which might induce an expectation that considerable resources are contemplated in the article of confiscation. Hitherto the 
treatment experienced by the agents and partizans of the House of Orange and of the former government has been 
remarkably moderate. The policy of burying in oblivion the differences which heretofore divided the people has 
been professed by the possessors of the new government, and forcibly recommended and inculcated by the French 
representatives and generals. A different system it is now said will probably be pursued. Several persons have 
within these two days been arrested, and pamphlets highly labored and well written are published, in order to give a new direction to the public opinion. 
</p><p>
It has already been mentioned that the municipal government of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> has long since ceased to harmonize 
with the general government of the province. The division continues, and increases from day to day. The municipality of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> have, therefore, determined to 
restore their functions to the people from whom they are supposed to have received them, and a new election is proposed speedily to take place. 
</p><p>
The Orange partizans have not yet abandoned their 
hopes ; they cannot yet persuade themselves that the 
King of Prussia will leave his sister and his daughter to 
their fate. The grounds upon which their expectations are founded have been mentioned heretofore, and although 
the conclusion of this new treaty destroys almost entirely the scaffolding of their system, the presence of the Prussian 
army in Westphalia still flatters them with the hopes of being once more conquered. 
</p><p>
The Russian charge des affaires has received orders from his court to quit this place without taking leave, and is 
gone accordingly. It can scarcely be a doubt but that the events of the last campaign, the unparalleled success of the 
French armies, together with the change in the principles professed by their government and the misfortunes of 
Poland, have produced a great revolution in the policy of almost all the European Cabinets. The objects which 
were the original causes of the war have disappeared in the vortex of events that have occurred. The division of 
France, or the establishment of a government in that country by external compulsion, is recognized as a vain imagination. The dread of political doctrines is equally removed, 
and the fears and jealousies which heretofore divided the several sovereigns of Europe have returned in all their force, to sow the seeds of future wars. 
</p><p>
A distinguished member of the National Convention 
declared about two months since, in a labored speech 
relative to the negotiations for peace, that the real enemies 
of the Republic were Britain, Austria and Russia, and he 
endeavored to prove that from those powers so much was 
to be apprehended by all the other in Europe, that France 
must naturally be the friend and ally of all the rest. The 
partition of Poland appears evidently to have occasioned 
a very serious difference between the allies, who made 
the conquest in conjunction. It has given an alarm to 
the Turks, to Sweden and Denmark, who find themselves 
henceforth exposed as the most immediate objects of Russian ambition. A variety of circumstances have concurred to prove that Great Britain and Russia harmonize 
in their present pursuits, and it is even affirmed that a new alliance has been formed between them, in consequence of 
which a Russian fleet is expected to be stationed in the Baltic during the present campaign. It is further supposed 
that a rupture will very soon take place between Russia and the King of Prussia. The reciprocal advantage to be 
afforded by Great Britain is the abandonment of Poland, and even the support of the Russian system there. Among 
the circumstances which corroborate these opinions are the recall of the British Minister who has heretofore resided 
in Poland, and the present recall of the Russian charge des affaires from this place. 
</p><p>
To counterbalance this association of Britain, Russia and Austria, it is supposed that the purpose of the French government will be to unite against it together with their own efforts the force of Prussia, Sweden and the Turkish Empire 
against the continental powers, and that of Holland, and perhaps of Spain against Britain. 
</p><p>
It will be undoubtedly from the intelligence you will receive directly from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, and from the officers of the 
French government in America, that the best conclusion may be drawn, whether the intention of exciting new enemies 
against Great Britain extends to the United States. In the conversations I had with the Representatives, soon after 
their first arrival here, they all assured me of their entire satisfaction in the neutrality of the United States. One of 
them (Richard) expressly said that the French government had been fully content with the assurance they had received 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague">Mr. Monroe</a>, that the treaty signed by Mr. Jay in November contained nothing inconsistent with the engagements of the United States with France. It is not to be 
dissimulated that the language held by the citizen Sieyes in the interview I had with him here, and of which an 
account has already been given, is of a different complexion. At the present moment the treaty itself may be more a 
cause of objection than its contents. 
</p><p>
There is one circumstance from which the most substantial hope of a general pacification proceeds, and it is 
almost the only one, but indicates the probability of war more extensive than it has been hitherto. The scarcity of 
provisions is severely felt by all the nations of Europe, and unless the means of cultivation, which have been very much 
reduced, and the commerce which has been nearly annihilated, should be restored by the return of peace, a general 
famine will be inevitable in the course of the following winter, or at latest by the ensuing spring. This prospect 
appears already so evidently to all the parties that it may possibly contribute to the success of negotiations which 
will, perhaps, not be interrupted by the hostilities of the present campaign. Some considerable change may perhaps 
be expected in the internal state of France, but what it will be is very uncertain, and it is impossible to calculate 
whether it will produce any alteration whatever in their external policy. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of respect, c.
