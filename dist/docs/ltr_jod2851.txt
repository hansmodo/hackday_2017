MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
OUR amiable friend Hancock, who, by the way, is our President, is to send his servant tomorrow for Cambridge. I am to send a few lines by him. If his man should come to you, to deliver this letter, treat him very kindly, because he is a kind, humane, clever fellow. 
</p><p>
We are distressed here for want of intelligence 
and information from you and from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Cambridge, &c. &c. &c. We have no regular advices. 
I received one kind letter from you in one from Colonel Warren. An excellent letter I had from 
him. It has done him great honor and me much good. My duty and love to all. I have had miserable health and blind eyes, almost ever since I left 
you ; but I found Dr. Young here, who, after scolding at me quantum sufficit, for not taking his advice, has pill d and electuary d me into pretty good order. My eyes are better, my head is better, so are my spirits. 
</p><p>
The Congress will support the Massachusetts. There is a good spirit here. But we have an amazing field of business before us. When I shall have 
the joy of meeting you and our little ones, I know not. The military spirit, which runs through the continent, 
is truly amazing. This city turns out two thousand men every day. Mr. Dickinson is a Colonel, Mr. Reed a Lieutenant-Colonel, Mr. Mifflin a Major. 
He ought to have been a General, for he has been the animating soul of the whole. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">Colonel Washington</a> appears at Congress, in his uniform, and, by his great experience and abilities in military matters, is of much service to us. 
</p><p>
Oh that I were a soldier ! I will be. I am reading military books. Every body must, and will, and shall be a soldier.
