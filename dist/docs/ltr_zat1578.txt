My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your highly esteemed letter of the 2 d ins accompanied by several 
newspapers and many slips cut from others, all containing matters of deep 
interest, has just reached me, alth it is at long intervals between their 
doing so, I presume most of your letters have found their way to me, as 
I recollect acknowledging the receipt of several referred to ; I have at any 
rate acknowledge the receipt of all which have reached me, alth some of 
them may not have found their way to the Barracks 
</p><p>
Mr Kilbourn had a very long passage I understand by the news 
papers which noticed his arrival in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, between the Brazos & the 
city, & very likely left immediately as you suppose, for S 1 Louis if he 
found a boat ready to start for that place, which I suppose prevented his 
calling as he had no time to lose, only having a leave for sity days 
</p><p>
I was truly gratified to learn through Majr or Cap Monroe, that they 
were all well at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> a few days before you saw him, which I trust 
will continue to be the case ; & presume they have left the Lake by or 
before this time, & hope have arrived in safety at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> & B. 
Rouge ; I was likewis greatly pleased to know your own health continued 
good, & if it has continued so up to the present time, which I flatter 
myself is the case, & the weather has been as cold there at the barracks, 
as it has been here for the last few days, it must have put an end to every 
thing like contageon there & in the city, if so you will have as much 
health where you are until the latter part of the next summer & autumn 
as in any portion of the Union. I was also much pleased to know you 
had heard from the boys, who were both well ; Joh ere this must be well 
on his way to Rio; it will be some time before you again get a letter from 
him, or he one from home; he has my best wishes for his health, success 
& prosperity whereever the winds may carry him ; if he succeeds in 
returning in health & without accident of any kind, in good repute with 
his officers, & untainted in morals, he may be consider on the high road 
to distinction ; let him avoid dissipation of every kind, & lose no oppor 
tunity of improving his mind by study, as well as keeping clear of forming 
a matrimonial connection, until he gets some rank, & he cannot fail to do 
well ; a midshipman with a wife is rather a bar to his advancement, & is 
too great weight for him to get on with comfortably ; he should keep out 
of debt & try to live on his pay. Rob I hope has settled down to his 
books with Mr Allen & I trust he is getting on as well as could be 
expected. Dick I hope will join his mother next month nearly if not 
quite restored to health ; & will I hope be ready & anxious to commence 
the study of a profession or enter into business of some kind ; he has 
already been idle too long 
</p><p>
I have this moment rec d a letter from Col Davis saying he had just, 
or was fast recovering from a severe attack of sickness, which had very 
much effected his eyes, which I deeply regretted to hear ; but he said 
nothing about his wounded foot ; he has accepted the appointment of 
Senator, which is only temporary ; the election comes on for four years 
to complete the late Senator Spraights term in March next, in Jackson the 
capitol of the state; I think there is but little doubt as to his election ; he 
appears however to be indifferent about it 
</p><p>
I have fixed on the 8th  of Nov r for leaving here for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a>, & 
expect to reach there by the i8 th where I intend to await the action of the 
dep 1 on my application for permission to leave the country ; & if acted on 
immediately I expect to hear the result from the 2o th to the 25th  & if 
favorable I will sail on the first good vessel that leaves the Brazos for N. 
Orleans, & hope to reach that place early in December, if not by the firs, 
so that you need not write me after the 10th  of the next month ; yet the 
leave may not be given, & we should be prepared for the worst ; at any 
rate I will be so I mentioned in my last letter that we had heard across the country 
from Mexicans, in a way that could be relied on, that the army under 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> had taken, & was in quiet possession of the City of Mexico, 
after considerable loss; but without giving particulars ; the last mail 
brought us an acc c of the killed from the 9th to the 1 8th  of Sept r when the 
righting ceased, from several sources, but nothing official ; from which it 
appears there was considerable loss on our side; the 5th Infy seems to 
have suffered more than any other corps, especially in officers; whether 
the taking the capital will result in peace, time must determine ; I inter 
into no speculations on the subject ; but shall be somewhat disappointed 
if there is not considerable discussion about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>s armistice, entered 
into with Santa Anna, which has resulted on our side in the loss of many 
valuable lives ; the papers favorable to Gen S. say the propositions for 
said armistice came from the enemy, but unfortunately the written documents proves the contrary ; it may be saddled on Mr Trist ; some body 
must take the responsibility, or rather it will be thrown on the Gen or 
the minister will have to shoulder it, or to divide it between them ; Santa 
Anna will have I am satisfied nothing to do with it 
</p><p>
There is no danger on this line the force here is sufficient to sustain 
itself while acting on the defensive, in fact I do not believe there will be 
any more righting except with small parties ; from what I can learn from 
well informed Mexicans, their army has pretty much disbanded 
</p><p>
Gen Pierces letter is a very contemptable afair, not worth the time 
or trouble it takes to read it, it is worthy of the author, but unworthy of 
an ex Senator of the U. States ; I expect to see many such effusions from 
that army, & I should not be surprised if the Gen in chief was to base 
his claims to the presidency on acct of his achievements in taking the City 
of Mexico ; he & his creatures will think it presumption for any one to 
dare to oppose him Had not the battle of Buena been fought & won 
there is great doubts whether he Gen Pierce would have performed such 
prodigies of valor, which he has shadowed forth on the occasioned alluded 
to. I regret to hear more on his wifes acc c than his own, that Mr C. had 
got in the predicament you state, between ourselves it is all wrong, & if 
some members of congress get hold of it, it will hardly redound to his or 
the credit of the army ; but it is none but it is no concern of ours, & let 
him settle it the best way he can ; prudence is a great virtue ; the lucre of 
gain is a terable business, & has caused the downfall of millions. He 
ought to be removed from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> I was quite pleased to hear 
you had been so successful the cases of those attacked with the prevail 
ing epidemic ; & thank you for the description in treating it ; & hope the 
change of weather from hot to cold has produced no considerable change 
for the worse 
</p><p>
Some of the papers seem to think that the excitement in my favor 
as regards the presidency, is on the decline, which may be so, & if so 
gives me no concern; the great arrangements or preparation for that bat 
tle will be fought in my opinion between now & the end of the next 
session of congress ; I will not be surprised if Mr Calhoun & his friends take 
such a course as will enduce the non slave holding states to unite on from 
said states for the presidency, if. so, it settles the question, they having the 
majority ; I have for some time doubted whether we would again have a 
chief magistrate for many years to come from a slave state much less a 
slave holder 
</p><p>
Nothing of interest has taken place on this line since I last wrote 
you 
</p><p>
My love to Ann & the girls & wishing you & yours continued 
health & prosperity, I remain truly &

Sincerely
