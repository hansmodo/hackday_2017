Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The Prince de Massaran being so good as to desire carrying a letter to you, I sit down to write you a few lines-. 
though I hope soon to see you. 
</p><p>
Enclosed I send a copy of one of <a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Mr. Deane's</a> letters ; 
I shall show you more when you come. 
</p><p>
In consequence of a proposition I sent over, the parliament of Britain have just passed an act for exchanging 
American prisoners. They have near 1100 in the jails of 
England and Ireland, all committed as charged with high 
treason. The act is to empower the king, notwithstanding 
such commitments, to consider them as prisoners of war, 
according to the law of nations, and exchange them as 
such. This seems to be giving up their pretensions of considering us as rebellious subjects, and is a kind of acknowledgment of our independence. Transports are now taking 
up to carry back to their country the poor, brave fellows. 
who have borne for years their cruel captivity, rather than 
serve our enemies, and an equal number of English are to 
be delivered in return. I have, upon desire, furnished passports for the vessels. 
</p><p>
Our affairs in Holland are en bon train ; we have some 
prospect of another loan there ; and all goes well here. 
</p><p>
The proposal to us of a separate peace with England, 
has been rejected in the manner you wish, and I am pretty 
certain they will now enter into a general treaty. I 
wrote you a few lines by last post, and on the same day a 
few more by the court courier. They were chiefly to press 
your coming hither to assist in the affair. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem, 
I am ever, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
