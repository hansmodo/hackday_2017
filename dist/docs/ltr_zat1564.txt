April 4th <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a> 
My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your welcome letter of the 3 d ult was duly rec d I was very much 
pleased to learn you had met the Surg n Gen who had made arrange 
ments with Gen Brooke, to assign you to duty at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> Bar 
racks on your arrival in that city ; which during the greater portion of 
the year is in some respects a desirable position ; besides being some 
what expensive, the greatest objection to it, is its unhealthiness during a 
few months of almost every year, when it has to be abandoned during 
that time to avoid the yellow fever, or some other epidemic prevails ; 
however all considered the arrangement may be looked on as a fortunate one, as it will at least enable you to have your family with you, 
which is a matter of great importance. You will I presume during the 
summer, if not the balance of the year, besides Majr Jouett & family, 
have Col Whistler & his people there ; but it will be well to make the 
best out of what cannot be avoided ; & to get along with such people the 
best plan is to adopt I have found is to be very polite, without being too 
intimate. Your leave of absence was forwarded some time since, but 
may have been delayed in consequence of our communications having 
been cut off between this & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a>, by the enemy for several weeks, 
but if you left before the order reached, it is all very well, & hope by this 
time if not before, if your trip across the gulf was a favorable one, you 
have reached your place of destination & without accident 
</p><p>
Since my return here, our communications with the Rio Grande 
have been pretty well reestablished, & our trains are passing between 
here & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> without interruption, with moderate escorts ; there is 
now nothing to apprehend in that direction but small bands of robbers, 
who infest the greater portion of the inhabited parts of this unfortunate 
country 
</p><p>
I observe my letter to Majr Gaines published in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> 
Express has made a wonderful sensation among politicians, editors & 
others throughout the country ; all of which I really look upon as 
" much ado about nothing " & it is a pity there was not something of 
more importance to agitate or to amuse to keep up an excitement among 
the masses 
</p><p>
What effect the battle of Buena Vista will have on the Mexican 
nation, as regards opening the way for negotiations, as to bringing about 
a peace between the the two countries time must determine ; but I truly 
hope it will have the happyest results ; the best informed portion of the 
Mexicans in this part of the country, say there will be peace in a few 
months, to which I say amen with all my heart. Whether my despatch 
to the Secretary of War, announcing the result of said battle, will be 
replied to or its receipt acknowledged by that high functionary, time 
must also determine ; as he has not for the last five months condescended 
to acknowledge a single communication from me, some of which I conceive was of much importance as regards the service in this quarter, much less to reply to them ; but if he still persists in pursuing such a 
contemptable, pitiful & ungentlemanly a course for the purpose of insulting 
or outraging me, which is quite likely he will do, but which is a matter 
of no importance, as the people will compell him to lay before the 
country in some one of the public journals said despatch, no matter how 
unwilling he may be to do so There has been constantly carried on 
against me, ever since the battle of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> by the high functionaries 
at Washington covertly attacks against me ; see the attacks of Ficklin 
Thompson & others in the House of Representatives, & Cass Bagby
&c in the Senate, all of which no doubt was made by order, which how 
ever gives me no concern; but I do not believe the War Secretary 
would have unmasked his batteries which he made the publication of my 
letter to Ge i 1 Gaines the pretext for doing, had he not supposed the 
arrangement entered into by him Scott & Co. would prostrate me ; that 
by withdrawing the greater part of the troops from me, & leaving me 
exposed to the enemy, which course they thought would be safer than to 
recall or relieve me, that I would either leave the country at once, or it 
was possible I might be laid on the shelf here, by barely acting on the 
defensive, or if the enemy advanced in force on the line I was left to 
defend with a greatly inadequate force, I would either be beaten, or 
would have fallen back on or beyond the Rio Grande, & in either contingency I would have been darned as a military man ; but thanks to a 
kind providence their nefarious schemes have been all defeated & the 
battle of Buena Vista I trust is the best reply I can make to them or 
their slanderous attacks 
</p><p>
It is matter of some little gratification that I pursued the identical 
course I did, for without one particle of vanity entering into the whole 
matter I am satisfied I saved the honor of the country, & our glorious 
stars & stripes from being trailed in the dust ; for had I left on the 
receipt of of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>s unmilitary & outrageous order for the U. States 
which many of my friends advised me to do we would not now have 
occupied a post other than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a>, if that save on the sea coast this 
side the Rio Grande, for as it was our communications between here 
& that river, was entirely cut off It is possible however that the 
dominant party may out, as well as in congress charge me with neglect 
of duty, in not capturing Santa Anna & the whole of his army, & that 
a vote of censure to that effect at the next session may be gotten up, & 
even pass that body ; the White House has set the whole pack of aspir 
ants to the occupancy of the same, to barking & snapping at my heels, 
including Jesup, Scott & others ; I obseve in a speech of Casses in the 
Senate, he takes the opportunity to eulogis in high terms the Q r Master 
Gen to shield the dep 1 from the attacks I had made on it; by referring to 
& quoting from a letter written by Jesup to the War dep f in which Cass 
is made to say, that Jesup stated to the War dept that the army had 
double the am t of transportation they needed at Fort Polk & Brown 
before the arrival of the Volunteers; as long as the army in question 
remained stationary, this might be so; but said statement was made to 
mislead & deceive the public & therefore was nothing more, nor less than 
a cool & premeditated falsehood ; as to Jesup, I have not looked on him 
as entirely sane since he wrote that more than rediculous Blair letter; but 
it is worse than rediculous that a U. States Senitor should endorse his 
absurd & erroneous statements; I dare him Cass & the whole concern to 
show before a proper tribunal that there is one word which is untrue in 
the letter to Gen Gaines, or that I have written to any one else in regard 
to transportations or any thing else, I have written since I have been in 
Mexico, or that is even highly coloured, Mr Jesup & Mr Casses state 
ment to the contrary notwithstanding 
</p><p>
It is quite likely there will be no more fighting in this section other 
than with small detachments who may perhaps attempt to rifle the trains, 
or rob smal parties in the road between this & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a>; Gen Santa 
Anna has gone to the City of Mexico where there is a revolution going 
on against the gov where it is stated there was considerable fighting 
between the parties the 6 th y th & 8th  ult ; he Santa Anna taking with him 
about six thousand troops from San Louis, in his proclimation issued just 
before leaving he will to save the beautiful City of Mexico & put down 
anarchy & strife, which is destroying the best interest of the country, he 
intends taking matters into his own hands ; so that it seems to me if we 
have another serious fight in this direction, or with this column, it will not 
be this side San Louis Potosi, or Zucatecas

Inclosed I you will find a check for five hundred on Col Hunt 
depty Q r Gen which please dispose of as you may think most advisable 
for the benefit of your family

You could certainly do me no good by remaining at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a> or 
Brazos, alth I do not consider the reports as regards our situation even 
at all exagerated, we might say with truth we were left at the mercy of the 
enemy, & nothing short of a miracle, saved us; our situation was a much 
more dangerous & desperate one than we were placed in at Forts Polk & 
Brown before the battles of the 8th  & 9th of May last ; why we were left 
as a forlorn hope to be destroyed by the enemy without there being any 
necessity for it, is a mystery to me, which can only be solved or explained 
by Marcy & Scott, which I hope some of the friends of those who fell on 
the plains of Buena Vista who was worth a hundred of them, will compell 
them to do

If this reaches you at Baton Rouge or if at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> Barracks, & 
they are with you my love to Ann & the children; or if you are at the 
latter place & they are at Baton Rouge, do so when you write; & wishing 
you & yours continued health health & prosperity I remain truly your
