My dear Sister
</p><p>
I have not heard from you for so long a time that I am fearful you are sick, and if so you must make the children write to me. I hope though that your health is unusually good.

Anna is unusually unwell but I trust that she will soon commence improving again. My eyes have improved greatly, through the blessing of Him who withholds no good thing from me, but in some respects my health is more impaired than it has been for some years. If I don't improve, I hope to leave for a Hydropathic establishment soon after our Commencement in July. And my plan is to send a servant with the carriage to meet me at the Depot nearest Beverly. What is the name of the Depot. I want the servant to get to your house a day or two in advance of the time, so that he will be certain to meet me. Anna and I will then return by Beverly in the carriage & send the servant home by the Rail Road. All this plan may be frustrated, but I am resolved to pay you the first visit which I make, so you may be satisfied that if I don't visit you that my health is such as to render medical treatment necessary.

I send some early Silesia Lettuce seed which I hope you will sow at once, and after it gets a few leaves on each plant, set the plants in rows so that the plants shall be 8 inches apart, and water them occasionally so as to keep the ground damp. I never was fond of lettuce until I tried this. I regard it as the largest, tenderest and finest flavored that I have ever tasted. If you wish any more seed let me know & I will send it. I am greatly gratified at the election of Wm. L. Jackson. I fear that I have a disease of the kidneys, the disease gives me pain every day. I experience unusual pain whilst riding in a carriage. Anna joins me in love to you all.

Your affectionate brother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjt" rel="me">Thomas</a>.
