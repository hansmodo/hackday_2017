...I have been over the house we are to occupy.  It is in wretched
condition.  Mrs. M. has not yet vacated it, but I have some men at work,
though this storm has interrupted their operations and I fear little
will be done this week.  I think I can make your room comfortable.
The upstairs is very convenient and the rest of the house sufficiently
so.  I think you had better write at once to Brit [the Brit mentioned
here is Mrs. Birtannia Kennon, of Tudor Place, my mother's first
cousin.  She had saved for us a great many of the household goods from
Arlington, having gotten permission from the Federal authorities to
do so, at the time it was occupied by their forces] to send the curtains
you speak of, and the carpets.  It is better to use what we have than
to buy others.  Their use where originally intended [Arlington, to that
beloved home my mother still hoped to return] is very uncertain.  They
have been tossed about for four years, and may be lost or ruined.
They can come by express to Lynchburg, and then up the canal, or by
Richmond.  The merchants say the former is the best way--much more
expeditious and but little more expensive.
