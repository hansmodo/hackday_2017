CAMP WASHINGTON, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>, 
March 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
The date above was written when I closed my last 
letter which is still on the " Princeton " and will not 
leave until tomorrow, so you will get several letters 
at one time, and I hope in so great an amount of scribblings you will find sufficient news to compensate for 
the labor of hunting out of the mass. 
</p><p>
It is now the twenty-ninth, Sunday, nine o clock at 
night. I have just come in from a picket tour of three 
days and two nights at the Puente Moreno, which is 
some six miles in the country, where on the twenty- 
fifth there was a smart skirmish in which we were, of 
course, victorious, though at the expense of some few 
killed and Lieutenant Neal and two or three privates 
wounded. I am almost tired to death and would not 
write another word was my news of less importance. 
The bombardment of the city continued until the 
evening of the twenty-sixth when it ceased, much to 
the amazement of all who were not in the secrets of 
our chief. Something was in the wind, but what, was 
all conjecture, and so continued when on the morning 
of the twenty-sixth I was ordered on picket. The 
wind was blowing a gale (you will think it is all wind 
here, but there is a goodly sprinkling of sand), my tent 
had just been blown down, not only down, but in 
pieces, and the few articles which I possess here had 
been scattered about and buried in the sand. I, however, headed my company and left everything to its 
fate, marching with two other companies, all under 
command of Major Sumner.

I was glad enough to get into the green country 
away from the sand hills. We made ourselves as comfortable as we could in our position, bivouacking on 
the bridge. Most of the night Sumner and myself 
spent in conjecture, and in discussing the probable 
causes of the strange silence of our batteries. On the 
twenty-seventh we heard from camp that it was owing 
to a flag received from the city with some proposals 
from the Mexican general, which a commission was 
discussing. We presumed it only related to the surrender of the city and at one o clock at night a Dragoon 
rode into our bivouac with a note from Colonel Hitchcock saying that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> had just approved the 
Articles of Capitulation. Huzza! Huzza! the city 
and the strong castle of San Juan have surrendered! 
Tomorrow, the thirtieth, the garrisons of both places 
are to march out, and our flag to float in place of the 
Mexican. The Mexican officers are to retain their 
side-arms, the rank and file to march without arms, 
and all to go into the interior on parole. Our brigade, 
General Worth s, are to meet them at the gates and 
take possession of the city and castle when they leave 
them. This is a great victory accomplished with little 
loss on our side, three officers and some ten men only 
having been killed. Five generals, eighteen colonels, 
etc., and between four and five thousand rank and 
file of the enemy become prisoners on parole. We 
possess the strongest place in Mexico. About three 
hundred cannon of all calibres, with all the arms, munitions of war and public property, undoubtedly worth 
some millions, are ours. 
</p><p>
We hear the distress in the city has been dreadful, 
some hundreds of women and children having been 
killed by our shells. This is horrible! I have this 
moment been notified that with my company I am 
to garrison Fort St. lago, a small work on the south 
east of the town. By the mail tonight I have received 
two letters from you but am too much worn out to 
answer them. I have been nine nights and days out 
of eighteen on picket, a considerable part of the time 
under the fire of the Mexican batteries and can 
scarcely see the paper, I would not read over this 
letter for anything! . . .
