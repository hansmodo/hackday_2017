My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>:  I wrote you yesterday by mail.  On returning to my
quarters last night after 11 P. M. Custis informed me Robert had
arrived and had made up his mind to go into the army.  He stayed at
the Spottswood, and this morning I went with him to get his overcoat,
blankets, etc.  There is great difficulty in procuring what is good.
They all have to be made, and he has gone to the office of the adjutant-
general of Virginia to engage in the service.  God grant it may be
for his good as He has permitted it.  I must be resigned.  I told him
of the exemption granted by the Secretary of War to the professors
and students of the university, but he expressed no desire to take
advantage of it.  It would be useless for him to go, if he did not
improve himself, nor would I wish him to go merely for exemption.  As
I have done all in the matter that seems proper and right, I must now
leave the rest in the hands of our merciful God.  I hope our son will
do his duty and make a good soldier....  I had expected yesterday to
go to North Carolina this morning, but the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed" rel="colleague met">President</a> changed his mind.
I should like to go to see you to-morrow, but in the present condition
of things do not feel that I ought to be absent....  I may have to
go to North Carolina or Norfolk yet.  New Berne, N. C., has fallen
into the hands of the enemy.  In Arkansas our troops under Van Dorn
have had a hard battle, but nothing decisive gained.  Four generals
killed--McIntosh, McCullogh, Herbert, and Slack.  General Price wounded.
Loss on both sides said to be heavy....

                             Very truly yours,
</p><p>
