My Precious Little Agnes:  I have received your letter of the 17th,
transmitting the photographs, for which I am very much obliged.  I
returned the one for Miss Laura Lippett, whom I wish I could see once
again.  It would be more agreeable to me than any photograph.  I had
quite a successful journey up, notwithstanding the storm.  The snow
increased as we approached the mountains, and night had set in before
we reached Staunton.  The next morning, before sunrise, in spite of
the predictions of the wise ones, I took passage on the single car
which was attached to the locomotive, and arrived at Goshen about 10
A. M., where, after some little encouragement, the stage-driver attached
his horses to the stage, and we started slowly through the mountains,
breaking the track.  On reaching the Baths, the North River was
unfordable, but I was ferried across in a skiff, with all my bundles
(I picked up two more in Staunton and one at Goshen) and packages,
and took a stage detained on the opposite bank for Lexington, where
I arrived in good time.  I found all as well as usual, and disappointed
at not seeing you with me, though I was not expected.  I told them how
anxious you were to come with me, and how you wanted to see them, but
that you looked so wretchedly I could not encourage you.  I hope you
are now in Norfolk, and that the fish and oysters will fatten you and
cure your feet!...  But get strong and keep well, and do not wear
yourself out in the pursuit of pleasure.  I hope you will soon join us,
and that Lexington may prove to you a happy home.  Your mother is a
great sufferer, but is as quiet and uncomplaining as ever.  Mildred
is active and cheerful, and Custis and I as silent as our wont.  Major
Campbell Brown is here on a visit.  I am surprised to find him such
a talker.  I am very sorry to find that Preston Cocke has been obliged
to leave on account of his health.  I have one comfort:  my dear nephew
will never injure himself by studying.  Do not be alarmed about him....
Remember me to Colonel Taylor, all his mother's family, his wife, the
Bakers, Seldens, etc.  I know none of the latter but the Doctor, for
whom I have always had a great esteem.  Your mother, brother, and
Mildred send their best love and kindest wishes.  I am always,
</p><p>
                 Your devoted father,     <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>.
