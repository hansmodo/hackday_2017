Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 25th I received letters from <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague'>Colonel Humphreys</a>, dated April 30th, May 30th, and June 1st, 
accompanied by a large packet from Mr. Barlow, at 
Algiers. The substance of the information respecting 
the pending treaty with Algiers is, that Mr. Donaldson had gone to Leghorn with orders from Mr. Barlow to transmit two hundred thousand dollars to Algiers, which would procure the redemption of our 
captive citizens ; that <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Humphreys</a> had sent to 
Mr. Donaldson, at Leghorn, a letter of credit for four 
hundred thousand dollars; and, in case he failed of 
obtaining the half of that sum. <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague'>Colonel Humphreys</a> 
authorized Mr. Barlow to draw on Bulkley & Son, 
at Lisbon, for two hundred thousand dollars, payable 
at sight, so as to insure the liberation of our prisoners within the three months allowed by the Dey; 
but with his explicit opinion, that no part of it should 
be paid unless the captives were released. From 
these arrangements, it seems to me highly probable 
that our fellow-citizens will now recover their liberty; 
and that the payment of the gross sum of two hundred thousand dollars will so far soothe the Dey, as 
to prolong his patience until the original stipulations, 
and the new one for the frigate, can be accomplished. 
Although the Dcy's disappointment in not receiving 
the stipulated sums on Mr. Barlow's arrival, put him 
into so violent a rage as to render all applications 
fruitless, yet, after some days, he sent notice to Mr. Barlow that he was willing to receive him as the 
Consul of the United States, and desired him to bring 
his Consular presents. Mr. Barlow readily complied. 
The presents were distributed to the Dey and his 
grandees. The Dey, in return, presented Mr. Barlow 
with a fine Barbary stallion. Cathcart writes that 
Mr. Barlow gives great satisfaction, and is respected 
by every one wdio knows him. This admission of 
Mr. Barlow as Consul, wdth the distribution of the 
Consular presents, cannot fail to have a favorable influence on the affairs of the United States at Algiers, 
and, from his information of the customary and periodical delivery of Consular presents, it does not appear that it will occasion any material extra expense 
to the United States. 
</p><p>
Mr. Barlow's packet contains long and interesting details of the nature of the Algerine Government, 
whence results the fickleness of its measures, and its 
frequent breaches of peace with the Christian States, 
on the most trifling and unreasonable pretexts. Because the armed vessels of the King of Naples carried into his port a Danish vessel, having on board 
three hundred and twenty Turkish soldiers, bound 
from the Levant to Algiers, the Dey ordered his 
cruisers immediately to bring in all the Danish vessels they could meet with. In a few days, about a 
dozen were captured and brought in, and their fate 
remained undecided. Mr. Barlow details divers instances of breaches with other powers ; whence he 
concludes that, on an average, we might count on a 
renewal of hostilities with ourselves once in six 
years. But the expenses of renewing, thus often, our 
treaties with that regency, may be willingly incurred, 
when the commercial profits of the Mediterranean are 
taken into view. Of one and the other, Mr. Barlow 
has given estimates, which, with his observations on 
the commerce of that part of the world, manifest 
much information, and that good sense for which he 
is distinguished. 
</p><p>
Mr. Barlow describes the policy and utility of 
forming commercial and friendly relations with the 
Italian States ; with Austria, on account of her great 
trading port of Trieste ; and with the grand Seignior. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague'>Colonel Humphreys</a>, concurring in these ideas (so far 
as respects the grand Seignior, he has formerly expressed the same), strongly recommends Mr. Barlow 
as the fittest person for the negotiator, particularly 
with the Turk, under the countenance of France ; Mr. B. being a French as well as an American citizen. 
Mr. Barlow would cheerfully engage in these enterprises; and I am now inclined to think it would not 
be easy to find another person equally qualified for 
these negotiations. 
</p><p>
As these matters do not demand an immediate decision, I imagined it would be acceptable to you to 
receive this general account of the contents of the 
despatches from <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague'>Colonel Humphreys</a>, and that the perusal of these would be more agreeable to you on 
your return to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>

or the day before, for the West Indies.
