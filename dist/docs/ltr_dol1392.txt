DEAR SISTER, My husband left me yesterday morning to join General Winder. He inquired anxiously whether I had courage or firmness to remain in the President s house until his return on the morrow, or succeeding day, and on my assurance that I had no fear but for him, and the success of our army, he left, beseeching me to take care of myself, and of the Cabinet papers, public and private. I have since received two despatches from him, written with a pencil. The last is alarming, because he desires I should be ready at a moment s warning to enter my carriage, and leave the city; that the enemy seemed stronger than had at first been reported, and it might happen that they would reach the city with the intention of destroying it. I am accordingly ready; I have pressed as many Cabinet papers into trunks as to fill one carriage; our private property must be sacrificed, as it is impossible to procure wagons for its transportation. I am determined not to go myself until I see <a href="/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> safe, so that he can accompany me, as I hear of much hostility towards him. Disaffection stalks around us. My friends and acquaintances are all gone, even Colonel C. with his hundred, who were stationed as a guard in this inclosure. French John, with his usual activity and resolution, offers to spike the cannon at the gate, and lay a train of powder, which would blow up the British, should they enter the house. To the last proposition I positively object, without being able to make him understand why all advantages in war may not be taken.

Wednesday Morning, twelve o clock. 
</p><p>
Since sunrise I have been turning my spy-glass in every direction, and watching with unwearied anxiety, hoping to discover the approach of my dear husband and 
his friends ; but, alas ! I can descry only groups of military, wandering in all directions, as if there was a lack of arms, or of spirit to fight for their own fireside. 
</p><p>
Three o clock. Will you believe it, my sister ? we have had a battle, or skirmish, 
near Bladensburg, and here I am still, within sound of the cannon! <a href="/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> comes not. May God protect us! 
Two messengers, covered with dust, come to bid me fly ; but here I mean to wait for 
him. ... At this late hour a wagon has been procured, and I have had it filled with plate and the most valuable portable articles, belonging to the house. Whether it 
will reach its destination, the " Bank of Maryland," or fall into the hands of British soldiery, events must determine. Our kind 
friend, Mr. Carroll, has come to hasten my departure, and in a very bad humor with me, because I insist on waiting until the 
large picture of General <a href="/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> is secured, and it requires to be unscrewed 
from the wall. This process was found too tedious for these perilous moments; I have ordered the frame to be broken, and the canvas taken out. It is done! and the 
precious portrait placed in the hands of two gentlemen of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, for safe keeping. And now, dear sister, I must leave 
this house, or the retreating army will make me a prisoner in it by filling up the road I am directed to take. When I shall again write to you, or where I shall be tomorrow, I cannot tell!
