MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE prospect that opens upon me presents troubles 
enough of every kind. I have made some inquiry 
concerning horses and carriages and find that a common chariot of the plainest sort cannot be had under 
twelve hundred dollars, and if you go to a little more 
ornament and elegance, you must give fifteen hundred. The President has a pair of horses to sell, one, 
nine, the other, ten years old, for which he asks a 
thousand dollars, and there is no probability of pro 
curing a decent span for less than six hundred dollars. House rent, another indispensable article, will 
be extravagantly high. The plenty of paper has unsettled every thing. Nothing has a price. Every 
one asks and every one cheats as much as he can, I 
think. I wish I knew what would be asked for a 
chariot in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
</p><p>
The President says he must sell something to en 
able him to clear out. When a man is about retiring 
from public life, and sees nothing but a ploughshare 
between him and the grave, he naturally thinks most 
upon that. When Charles the fifth resigned his empire and crown, he went to building his coffin. 
When I contemplated a retirement, I meditated the 
purchase of Mrs. Vesey's farm, and thought of building a tomb on my own ground adjoining to the burying yard. The President is now engaged in his speculations upon a vault which he intends to build for 
himself, not to sleep but to lie down in. So you see, 
my little head is made like two great heads, and I 
have ambitiously placed myself between them. Mrs. 
Blodget, who, I dare say, is more desirous that you 
should be Presidente than that I should be President, 
says she is afraid <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>President Washington</a> will not live 
long. I should be afraid too, if I had not confidence 
in his farm and his horse. He must be a fool, I think, 
who dies of chagrin when he has a fine farm and a 
Narraganset mare that paces, trots and canters. But 
I don t know but all men are such fools. I think a 
man had better wear than rust.

The boyish language of the emissaries from Monroe's academy is not confined to Boston market. 
Captain B is holding the same cant. John Adams must be an intrepid to encounter the open assaults 
of France and the secret plots of England in concert 
with all his treacherous friends and open enemies in 
his own country. Yet I assure you he never felt more serene in his life. 
</p><p>
Yours most tenderly,
