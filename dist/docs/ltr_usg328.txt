<i>biograper's note</i><p>[After the fall of Fort Donelson Grant was promoted to the grade of
major-general. Had this victory been immediately followed up, he
believed that the entire southwest would have offered little
resistance; and had there been one general who would have taken the
responsibility and been in command of all the troops west of the
Alleghanies, the duration of the war would have been far briefer than
it was.
</p><p>
Corinth was the junction of the two most important railroads in the
Mississippi Valley. It was the great strategic position in the West
between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers, and between Nashville
and Vicksburg. If the Union troops obtained possession of Corinth the
Confederates would have no railroad for transportation of armies or
supplies until that running east from Vicksburg was reached.
</p><p>
The enemy was in force at Corinth, March 17th. He attacked Shiloh,
April 6th, was defeated April 7th, and evacuated Corinth May 30th.
</p><p>
Up to this time, Grant had believed that the rebellion would suddenly
collapse if a decisive victory could be gained. Donelson and Henry
were such victories, but now that the Confederates had collected new
armies and assumed the offensive, he gave up all idea of saving the
Union except by complete conquest. Hitherto, he had protected the
property of both Federal and Confederate. Now he began a new policy;
he consumed everything that could be used to support armies, regarding
supplies within reach of the Confederates as contraband as arms or
ordnance stores. This policy, he says, exercised a material influence
in hastening the end.

July 11th, Halleck is appointed to the command of all the armies, with
headquarters at Washington. Grant now has his headquarters at Corinth
in command of the District of West Tennessee. He is practically a
department commander.]</p><hr>

DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
Your letter of the 25th of July is just received. I do not remember
receiving the letters, however, of which you speak. One came from Mary
speaking of the secessionist Holt who was said to be employed in the
Memphis post office. I at once wrote to <a href="/results.php?tla=wts" rel="co-worker met">General Sherman</a> who is in
command there about it and he is no doubt turned out before this.
</p><p>
You must not expect me to write in my own defence nor to permit it
from any one about me. I know that the feeling of the troops under my
command is favorable to me and so long as I continue to do my duty
faithfully it will remain so. Your uneasiness about the influences
surrounding the children here is unnecessary. On the contrary it is
good. They are not running around camp among all sorts of people, but
we are keeping house, on the property of a truly loyal secessionist
who has been furnished free lodging and board at Alton, Illinois; here
the children see nothing but the greatest propriety.
</p><p>
They will not, however, remain here long. Julia will probably pay her
father a short visit and then go to Galena or Covington in time to
have the children commence school in September.
</p><p>
I expect General Hitchcock to command the Department of the West. Have
no fears of General Pope or any one junior to me being sent.
</p><p>
I do not expect nor want the support of the Cincinnati press on my
side. Their course has been so remarkable from the beginning that
should I be endorsed by them I should fear that the public would
mistrust my patriotism. I am sure that I have but one desire in this
war, and that is to put down the rebellion. I have no hobby of my own
with regard to the negro, either to effect his freedom or to continue
his bondage. If Congress pass any law and the President approves, I am
willing to execute it. Laws are certainly as binding on the minority
as the majority. I do not believe even in the discussion of the
propriety of laws and official orders by the army. One enemy at a time
is enough and when he is subdued it will be time enough to settle
personal differences.
</p><p>
I do not want to command a department because I believe I can do
better service in the field. I do not expect to be overslaughed by a
junior and should feel exceedingly mortified should such a thing
occur, but would keep quiet as I have ever done heretofore.
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from Captain Foley about this same Holt
said to be in the Memphis post office. You may say that I shall refer
it to <a href="/results.php?tla=wts" rel="co-worker met">General Sherman</a> with the direction to expel him if it is not
already done.
</p><p>
Julia and the children are well. I do not expect to remain here long
but when I will go I can't say now.
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
