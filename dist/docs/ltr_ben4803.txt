DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your kind favour of Nov. 9. and am glad to hear 
of the Welfare of you and yours. 
</p><p>
Mentioning to a Friend of mine, Mr. Wooller, an Engineer, 
your Idea of Paint and Sand, to make Roofs durable and safer 
from Fire (which I hope you will try, as I think it very likely 
to succeed) he communicated to me an Account of a new 
Method of Covering, in the North, that is in some respects 
similar, may be as durable, but in my Opinion not so safe. 
Perhaps it may be of Use for Summer-Houses, Barns, Outhouses, or Buildings where no Fire comes; (and therefore 
I send you the Account enclosed) but I think I should not 
care to trust it in a Dwelling-House, in a Town, unless the 
under Side of the Boards was lathed & plaistered between the 
Rafters, which would add to the Expence : For tho' the Outside, hardened by the Air, and paved as it were, by the Sand, 
Shells, &c. might not readily take fire, the Tar coming thro' 
the Seams or Cracks of the Boards might be readily inflamed 
by a Candle from the Inside, placed carelessly by Servants 
in the Garret. 
</p><p>
The Flatness of the Roof, as well as of those with Copper, 
lessens a good deal the Areas to be covered, and of course the 
Expence. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear that you have good Workmen in the 
Stucco Way, and that it is likely to take place of Wainscot.

In some of the Paris Buildings the Floors are thus formed. 
The Joists are large and square, and laid with two of their 
Corners up and down, whereby their sloping Sides afford 
Butments for intermediate Arches of Brick. Over the whole 
is laid an Inch or two of Loom and on that the Tiles of the 
Floor, which are often six-square, & painted. The lower 
Corner of the Joists is cut off enough to admit of nailing 
to them the Laths that are to hold the Plaister of the Cieling of the Room beneath. Where there is any Apprehension of Walls spreading by the Weight of such Floor, they 
are prevented by Bars of Iron, with external SS. This kind 
of Floor seems safe from Fire : For the Joists in Contact with 
the Bricks above, and shielded by the Plaister Cieling below 
are not very likely to kindle and burn. It likewise prevents 
in a great degree the Noise of what is doing over-head offending those below. But it is heavy, takes up more Room, requires great Strength of Timber and is supposed more expensive than Boards. I apprehend those Arches are not generally used; but the Tiles are more commonly laid upon 
rough Boards & the Joints clos'd with fine Mortar or some 
kind of Cement. 
</p><p>
Plaster Floors are of late coming again into Use here. I 
know not whether we have the proper Materials in our Province ; but I have been told there are Quarries of the kind in 
Nova Scotia near navigable Water. I send you however 
an Account of the Method of managing it. All from my 
Friend the ingenious Mr Wooller. 
</p><p>
Remember me respectfully & affectionately to M rs Rhoads 
& my dear old Friend Mrs Paschal. 
</p><p>
With sincere Esteem, I am, dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately 
</p><p>

I send you also a Pamphlet on the Subject of securing 
Houses from Fire tho' the Method is perhaps impracticable 
with us.
