Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 22d of last month reached me too late 
to reply by the last post. If your friends speculate in the Assignates I wish them much success, but I incline to think that 
there will be more loss then gain in such speculations. You 
and I know a little about paper money. There is somewhere 
on the way towards me a long letter and other documents respecting some lands in America, about which we have had a 
conversation together. I will write to you about that affair 
when I receive it. You mistake me if you suppose that I 
meant to stimulate your endeavors. I was prompted merely 
by a common sense of justice. Why should your time and attention be consumed by the business of other people ? But I 
quit this subject. 
</p><p>
Pray let me know how affairs go on. I think the public 
opinion is now inflated by the Assignats, which will prove at 
last to be but a frail reliance. There seems to be a kind of 
petite guerre between the Assemblee and M. Necker. This 
will do no good to either ; but in such contests the one gene 
rally sinks under the efforts of the many. How stands our 
friend Lafayette. Very much depends on him. I see no 
means of extricating you from your troubles, but that which 
most men would consider as the means of plunging you into 
greater I mean a war. And you should make it to yourselves a war of men, to your neighbors a war of money. I do not 
explain, because a word to the wise is sufficient. You want 
just now great men to pursue great measures. As to the idea 
that you can keep out of the fire, which consumes your neighbors and your allies, it is ridiculous. You must suffer either 
for or with them ; and the latter is at once the nobler and the 
safer position. But I correct and check myself with a due 
respect for the gentlemen in the several post offices, who will, 
I hope, permit my letter to go forward and convey to you 
the assurance of my regard.
