TONAI, ISLAND OF HAWAII, April 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1851">1851</a>

'Man proposes but God disposes.' I proposed, the next time I wrote, to be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> but circumstances over which we had no control obliged us to put in here. Our North East wind turned into a gale and blew for a week steadily. After it had abated, on Sunday night, March 23d, the schooner fetched a lurch and carried away the head of the foremast close to the Cap. When the foretopmast went, it carried away the main topmast and the jibboom and tore the mainsail from top to bottom. In fact, we were a perfect wreck. The next morning we cleared away and set the square sail and were off before it, toward Hilo. We were just 90 miles to the East of Hawaii. We fell to leeward of Hilo and finally fetched this place last Thursday. Here we are rigging the Schooner over again. Have cut the foremast and made a Brig of her.

This bay is on the northwest side of the island and a more barren, dreary-looking place you can't imagine. There is one store, four or five grass houses and lots of goats. Mr. Frazer found an old friend, Mr. Loyado, who has a sugar plantation ten miles in the interior at a place called Wainua. He invited us to come up and stop with him and on Saturday we walked up.

The country is much better in the interior: large plains covered with cattle and horses and looks very much like California. But there are no trees until higher
up. His place is 4000 feet high and is close to the great volcano, Mauna loa, which is 13,600 feet high with the top covered with snow. He has 100 acres in sugar cane and a fine house, sugar mill, shops, etc. There are four or five white men and 123 natives on the plantation. He gives them four dollars per month and boards them, paying them in goods out of his store at an enormous profit. He has been here eighteen years and has made a fortune. He and all the other white men are married to native women. He lives first-rate and showed us every attention. He is a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>er and a fine, open-hearted man whose house is always open to strangers.

On Sunday I went to church. The Rev. Mr. Lyons, who is the missionary here, seated me with his family. He is very much liked and respected by the foreigners, which is not generally the case. It was communion day and a child was baptised. Everything was done as at home but the congregation looked gay as the women wear white dresses and bright red or orange colored shawls. In personal appearance they are vastly inferior to the natives of Tahiti. There was not one handsome woman in the house. They are dirty and their houses are filthy. They have no tropical fruits here at all and live on taro and fish. The men are good fellows to work and make good sailors. They are great people to visit and the vessels running from one island to another go with their decks covered with passengers.

The Schooner Caroline lay here bound for Salina. Captain Brown politely invited us on board to tea. He had his wife with him. She is a native of Hupuri, an island near Tahiti, and all his men were kanakas and had their wives on board. Brown had a fine, large cabin with a sofa and mirrors and everything good to eat and drink, and with his pretty wife to light his cigar for him seemed to take as much comfort as a man can at sea.

I came down from Wainua yesterday and spent the afternoon rambling along the beach. They are inveterate beggars here. If you go into a house they want a quarter and if they do anything for you they want to be paid California prices. This is rather disgusting after the hospitable treatment I received at the bamboo houses at Tahiti, where I was always welcome to eat, drink, smoke and sleep and give them what I pleased, or at the Marquesas where I used to have a boy to wait on me and run after cocoanuts and pull in the boat all day for a Jewsharp. But they have their eye-teeth cut here. At the Marquesas money is of no value, the only place I have ever seen where this is the case.

Old 'Blue face,' a chief at Wahooya who went over to Dominique with us, gave us two boat loads of wood and brought off two dollars wrapped up in a rag and gave the Captain. We told him that the wood was enough but he said the money was not the least use to him and would insist on the Captain keeping it. They are true children of nature and in my opinion vastly better off and happier in this state than after they know the wants and vices attendant on intercourse with foreigners, like these poor miserable people ashore here. This is no argument against the Missionaries. They try and I believe do the natives a great deal of good in learning them to read and write and keep the Sabbath, but they have hard work to make Christians of them and they are not half so pious and moral as I supposed from reading missionary reports.
