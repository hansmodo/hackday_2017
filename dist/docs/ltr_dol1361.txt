MY DEAREST <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, How delighted I should be to accompany you to all the 
charming places you mentioned, to see all the kind people, and to play Loo with Mrs. Knox. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> would write, but is overwhelmed with business. The British, 
French, and Spanish infringements are all under his pen ; he expects General A. 
every day, who is to succeed Mr. Livingstone, to receive his instructions. He always sends his affectionate love. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a> has been set on fire five different 
times, and it is suspected some malicious persons are determined to reduce it to 
ashes. Oh, the wickedness of men and women! I am afraid to accept their invitations.
