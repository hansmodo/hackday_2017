SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, at twelve o clock, I received your letter 
by Major Johnson. I immediately gave the necessary directions. Some companies I ordered to New 
London; others to New Haven; Colonel Webb, with 
the companies that way, if not marched, to take his 
station at Greenwich. Same day, at eleven o clock, 
I received a letter from Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague'>General Wooster</a>, 
dated the 9th, at the Oyster Ponds, on Long Island. 
He had with him four hundred and fifty men, besides 
militia, designing to preserve the stock at that place. 
The people on the Island had left it. He applied to 
me for three hundred pounds of powder, before I 
had made my answer and order for the powder, 
which I gave, notwithstanding our exhausted condition. On receipt of yours, I inserted an extract from 
it, for his observation. 
</p><p>
I am informed a quantity of powder for the camp 
is to be at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> this evening, and more to follow soon. We have none lately arrived, which is 
daily expected. I request your direction, that of the 
next quantity that comes to <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, there may be 
lodged there so much as you shall judge expedient. 
Of what is expected do arrive in the mean time, I 
shall have no occasion to use your allowance. 
I am, most respectfully, 
</p><p>
