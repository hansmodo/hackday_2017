<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='3'>3d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Yesterday was such a lucky day for my housekeeping in our hired house. Oh, ye kind Columbia 
folk! Mrs. Alex Taylor, nee Hayne, sent me a huge bowl of yellow butter and a basket to match of every vegetable 
in season. Mrs. Preston's man came with mushrooms freshly cut and Mrs. Tom Taylor's with fine melons.

Sent Smith and Johnson (my house servant and a carpenter from home, respectively) to the Commissary's with 
our wagon for supplies. They made a mistake, so they said, and went to the depot instead, and stayed there all day. I 
needed a servant sadly in many ways all day long, but I hope Smith and Johnson had a good time. I did not lose 
patience until Harriet came in an omnibus because I had neither servants nor horse to send to the station for her.

Stephen Elliott is wounded, and his wife and father have gone to him. Six hundred of his men were destroyed 
in a mine ; and part of his brigade taken prisoners : Stoneman and his raiders have been captured. This last fact 
gives a slightly different hue to our horizon of unmitigated misery.

General L - told us of an unpleasant scene at the President's last winter. He called there to see Mrs. McLean. <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> was in the room and he did not speak to her. He did not intend to be rude ; it was merely an oversight. And so he called again and tried to apologize, to remedy his blunder, but the President was inexorable, and 
would not receive his overtures of peace and good-will. General L - is a New York man. Talk of the savagery 
of slavery, heavens! How perfect are our men's manners down here, how suave, how polished are they. Fancy one 
of them forgetting to speak to <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> in her own drawing-room.
