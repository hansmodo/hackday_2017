On Monday week, at 4 1/2 o'clock A.M., I left Sonora for Stockton, in a five-horse coach of Adams & Co. In the coach were fourteen passengersa Chilian woman, a Mexican child, two Mexicans, a Dutchman, and several Yankees. At Stockton, I took passage on a steamer for San Francisco. I found the city very much changed in appearance.

A large number of persons bound for Panama held a meeting on Long Wharf and formed a company of 37, myself included. Great excitement prevailed among the passengers and steamboat runners. The steamship Golden Gate came down from Benicia. She is a splendid boat, and a good deal of competition exists between her and the Winfield Scott, also an excellent boat. Fare is very low on both of them, steerage to Panama being only $40. We obtained our choice of berths in the forward saloon or cabin in the Winfield Scott at $40, which had been selling singly at $110.

I shipped ninety-three ounces of gold dust to the mint in Philadelphia through Adams & Co., purchased a bill of $35 in clothing, and bought a watch at auction for $34. Our company bought the following, as private stores during our passage down:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 case claret wine   $4.50</li>
	<li>3 cans oysters   3.00</li>
	<li>6 boxes sardines   $3.00</li>
	<li>2 lbs. white sugar   .50</li>
	<li>1 can crackers   2.50</li>
	<li>3 lbs. butter   2.50</li>
	<li>2 lbs. cheese   .50</li>
	<li>1 bottle brandy, best   1.00</li>
	<li>1 can preserves   4.00</li>
</ul>
<p>
We took our stores and baggage aboard, and drew our special deposits from Adams & Co.

At noon on Saturday, in cold, foggy, and gloomy weather, the plank was drawn, two guns were fired on the ship, and in a few minutes the boat moved off. In an hour we had passed the Golden Gate and were on the broad Pacific. We kept down the coast in sight of hilly and rugged land until evening.

All is quiet and orderly on board. There are many passengers and all are contented and satisfied, only a few having been seasick. So far I have luckily escaped this scourge.

The weather has become more pleasant and the sun has shone occasionally. We are a good distance out at sea. Yesterday the sails were out all day and we made 254 miles. Today there is no wind and the sails are not set. I have seen no sea birds or fish of any kind. The passengers amuse themselves with cards and I spent an hour in this manner today with several friends. We passed a small island about dark, name forgotten.
