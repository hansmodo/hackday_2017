MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
SINCE my last, I have had the inexpressible pleasure 
of yours of the 25th of March by the way of Holland, 
which is the first and the last letter as yet received 
from you. This will be delivered to you by a young 
gentleman of the name of Archer, who is going to 
America to serve in our army as a volunteer. He is 
a promising youth, and will tell you all the news both 
in England and France. Germany seems at the eve 
of war. The Emperor and King of Prussia are at 
the head of armies, and on tiptoe to strike the blow. 
England seems to be lost in a stupor. Byron's fleet 
is not yet sailed. D Estaing's passed the straits of 
Gibraltar the 16th of May. 
</p><p>
We long to hear from America the ratification of 
the treaty with France, the captivity of <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>General Clinton</a>'s army, and of Lord Howe's fleet. John is very 
well at school. Stevens is also well and behaves 
well. My love to all my little ones. 
</p><p>
I want a few pamphlets here ; " The thoughts on 
Government," " The <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Constitution," " An 
essay of a constitution of government for Pennsylvania," said to have been written by Mr. Dickinson. 
Look them up and send them. 
</p><p>
I cannot learn that any reinforcement is to be sent 
to America this summer. They can spare none. 
They are in a panic from an apprehension of an invasion. Ireland is grown tumultuous, is concerting a 
non-importation agreement, and gives symptoms of an 
insurrection.
