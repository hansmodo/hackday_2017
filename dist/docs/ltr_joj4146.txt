Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received and read with pleasure your elegant 
eulogium on the late Mr. Rittenhouse. Such attentions to 
worthy characters, cherish and encourage modest merit. 
As a man and a philosopher, his title to esteem and praise 
is, I believe, universally acknowledged. 
</p><p>
The "Illustrations of the Prophecies" which you mention, 
I have not seen. On my return to New-York I will inquire 
for it. The author's applying certain of the prophecies to 
certain recent events, renders his work the more interesting. 
I have frequently known this to be done with more imagination than judgment, but from your account of the book, 
I presume it is not liable to that remark. The subject 
naturally excites attention, and the present extraordinary 
state of things permits an idea to slide into the mind, that 
even additional events, admitting of a like application, may 
precede a general peace. 
We live, my dear sir, in times that furnish abundant 
matter for serious and profound reflections. It is a consolatory (me, thai every scourge of every kind by which 
nations are punished or corrected, is under the control of a 
wise and benevolent Sovereign. 
</p><p>
With sincere esteem and regard, 1 am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your faithful and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
