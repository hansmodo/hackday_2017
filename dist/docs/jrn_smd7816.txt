</p><p>
After all our trials and tribulations, here we are at last, and no limbs lost ! How many weeks ago was 
it since I wrote here? It seems very long after all these events; let me try to recall them. 
</p><p>
Wednesday the 28th, a day to be forever remembered, as luck would have it, we rose very 
early, and had breakfast sooner than usual, it would seem for the express design of becoming famished 
before dinner. I picked up some of my letters and papers and set them where I could find them when 
ever we were ready to go to Green well, burning a pile of trash and leaving a quantity equally worthless, 
which were of no value even to myself except from association. I was packing up my traveling-desk 
with all Harry's little articles that were left to me, and other things, and I was saying to myself that 
my affairs were in such confusion that if obliged to run unexpectedly I would not know what to save, 
when I heard Lilly's voice downstairs, crying as she ran in she had been out shopping - - " Mr. Castle 
has killed a Federal officer on a ship, and they are going to shell - Bang! went a cannon at the word, and that was all our warning. 
</p><p>
Mother had just come in, and was lying down, 
but sprang to her feet and added her screams to the 
general confusion. Miriam, who had been searching 
the libraries, ran up to quiet her; Lilly gathered her 
children, crying hysterically all the time, and ran to 
the front door with them as they were; Lucy saved 
the baby, naked as she took her from her bath, only 
throwing a quilt over her. I bethought me of my 
"running-bag" which I had used on a former case, 
and in a moment my few precious articles were secured under my hoops, and with a sunbonnet on, I 
stood ready for anything. 
</p><p>
The firing still continued ; they must have fired half 
a dozen times before we could coax mother off. What 
awful screams! I had hoped never to hear them 
again, after Harry died. Charlie had gone to Greenwell before daybreak, to prepare the house, so we 
four women, with all those children and servants, 
were left to save ourselves. I did not forget my poor 
little Jimmy ; I caught up his cage and ran down. Just 
at this moment mother recovered enough to insist 
on saving father's papers which was impossible, 
as she had not an idea of where the important ones 
were. I heard Miriam plead, argue, insist, command 
her to run; Lilly shriek, and cry she should go; the 
children screaming within ; women running by without, crying and moaning; but I could not join in. 
I was going I knew not where; it was impossible to 
take my bird, for even if I could carry him, he would 
starve. So I took him out of his cage, kissed his little 
yellow head, and tossed him up. He gave one feeble 
little chirp as if to ascertain where to go, and then 
for the first and last time I cried, laying my head 
against the gate-post, and with my eyes too dim to 
see him. Oh, how it hurt me to lose my little bird, 
one Jimmy had given me, too! 
</p><p>
But the next minute we were all off, in safety. A 
square from home, I discovered that boy shoes were 
not the most comfortable things to run in, so I ran 
back, in spite of cannonading, entreaties, etc., to get 
another pair. I got home, found an old pair that 
were by no means respectable, which I seized with 
out hesitation ; and being perfectly at ease, thought it 
would be so nice to save at least Miriam's and my 
tooth-brushes, so slipped them in my corsets. These 
in, of course we must have a comb that was added 
then how could we stand the sun without starch 
to cool our faces? This included the powder- bag ; 
then I must save that beautiful lace collar; and my 
hair was tumbling down, so in went the tucking-comb and hair-pins with the rest; until, if there 
had been any one to speculate, they would have 
wondered a long while at the singular appearance 
of a girl who is considered as very slight, usually. 
By this time, Miriam, alarmed for me, returned 
to find me, though urged by Dr. Castleton not 
to risk her life by attempting it, and we started off 
together. 
</p><p>
We had hardly gone a square when we decided 
to return a second time, and get at least a few articles 
for the children and ourselves, who had nothing 
except what we happened to have on when the shelling commenced. She picked up any little things and 
threw them to me, while I filled a pillow-case jerked 
from the bed, and placed my powder and brushes in 
it with the rest. Before we could leave, mother, 
alarmed for us both, came to find us, with Tiche.
All this time they had been shelling, but there was 
quite a lull when she got there, and she commenced 
picking up father's papers, vowing all the time she 
would not leave. Every argument we could use was 
of no avail, and we were desperate as to what course 
to pursue, when the shelling recommenced in a few 
minutes. Then mother recommenced her screaming 
and was ready to fly anywhere ; and holding her box 
of papers, with a faint idea of saving something, she 
picked up two dirty underskirts and an old cloak. 
</p><p>
By dint of Miriam's vehement appeals, aided by a great deal of pulling, we got her down to the back 
door. We had given our pillow-case to Tiche, who added another bundle and all our silver to it, and had already departed. 
</p><p>
As we stood in the door, four or five shells sailed over our heads at the same time, seeming to make a 
perfect corkscrew of the air, for it sounded as though it went in circles. Miriam cried, "Never mmd the door!" mother screamed anew, and I 
stayed behind to lock the door, with this new music in my ears. We reached the back gate, that was on the street, when another shell passed us, and Miriam 
jumped behind the fence for protection. We had only gone half a square when Dr. Castleton begged us to take another street, as they were firing up that 
one. We took his advice, but found our new street worse than the old, for the shells seemed to whistle their strange songs with redoubled vigor. The height 
of my ambition was now attained. I had heard Jimmy laugh about the singular sensation produced by the rifled balls spinning around one's head ; and 
here I heard the same peculiar sound, ran the same risk, and was equal to the rest of the boys, for was I not in the midst of flying shells, in the middle of a 
bombardment? I think I was rather proud of it. 
</p><p>
We were alone on the road, all had run away before, so I thought it was for our especial entertainment, this little affair. I cannot remember how 
long it lasted; I am positive that the clock struck 
ten before I left home, but I had been up so long, I 
know not what time it began, though I am told it 
was between eight and nine. We passed the grave 
yard, we did not even stop, and about a mile and a 
half from home, when mother was perfectly exhausted with fatigue and unable to proceed farther, 
we met a gentleman in a buggy who kindly took 
charge of her and our bundles. We could have 
walked miles beyond, then, for as soon as she was 
safe we felt as though a load had been removed from 
our shoulders; and after exhorting her not to be 
uneasy about us, and reminding her we had a pistol 
and a dagger, I had secured a "for true" one the 
day before, fortunately, she drove off, and we 
trudged on alone, the only people in sight on foot, 
though occasionally carriages and buggies would 
pass, going towards town. One party of gentlemen 
put their heads out and one said, "There are Judge Morgan's daughters sitting by the road!" but I 
observed he did not offer them the slightest assistance. However, others were very kind. One I never 
heard of had volunteered to go for us, and bring us 
to mother, when she was uneasy about our staying 
so long, when we went home to get clothes. We heard 
him ring and knock, but, thinking it must be next 
door, paid no attention, so he went back and mother 
came herself. 
</p><p>
We were two miles away when we sat down by the 
road to rest, and have a laugh. Here were two 
women married, and able to take care of themselves, 
flying for their lives and leaving two lorn girls alone 
on the road, to protect each other! To be sure, 
neither could help us, and one was not able to walk, 
and the other had helpless children to save; but it 
was so funny when we talked about it, and thought 
how sorry both would be when they regained their 
reason! While we were yet resting, we saw a cart 
coming, and, giving up all idea of our walking to Greenwell, called the people to stop. To our great 
delight, it proved to be a cart loaded with Mrs. Brunot's affairs, driven by two of her negroes, who 
kindly took us up with them, on the top of their lug 
gage; and we drove off in state, as much pleased at 
riding in that novel place as though we were accustomed to ride in wheelbarrows. Miriam was in a 
hollow between a flour barrel and a mattress ; and 
I at the end, astride, I am afraid, of a tremendous 
bundle, for my face was down the road and each 
foot resting very near the sides of the cart. I tried 
to make a better arrangement, though, after a while. 
These servants were good enough to lend us their 
umbrella, without which I am afraid we would have 
suffered severely, for the day was intensely warm. 
</p><p>
Three miles from town we began to overtake the 
fugitives. Hundreds of women and children were 
walking along, some bareheaded, and in all costumes. Little girls of twelve and fourteen were 
wandering on alone. I called to one I knew, and 
asked where her mother was ; she didn't know ; she 
would walk on until she found out. It seems her 
mother lost a nursing baby, too, which was not 
found until ten that night. White and black were all 
mixed together, and were as confidential as though 
related. All called to us and asked where we were 
going, and many we knew laughed at us for riding 
on a cart; but as they had walked only five miles, I 
imagined they would like even these poor accommodations if they were in their reach. 
The negroes deserve the greatest praise for their 
conduct. Hundreds were walking with babies or 
bundles; ask them what they had saved, it was in 
variably, " My mistress's clothes, or silver, or baby." 
Ask what they had for themselves, it was, " Bless 
your heart, honey, I was glad to get away with mistress's things; I didn't think bout mine." 
</p><p>
It was a heart-rending scene. Women searching 
for their babies along the road, where they had been 
lost; others sitting in the dust crying and wringing 
their hands ; for by this time we had not an idea but 
what <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> was either in ashes, or being 
plundered, and we had saved nothing. I had one 
dress, Miriam two, but Tiche had them, and we had 
lost her before we left home. 
</p><p>
Presently we came on a guerrilla camp. Men and 
horses were resting on each side of the road, some sick, 
some moving about carrying water to the women 
and children, and all looking like a monster barbecue, 
for as far as the eye could see through the woods, was 
the same repetition of men and horses. They would 
ask for the news, and one, drunk with excitement or 
whiskey, informed us that it was our own fault if we had saved nothing, the people must have been 
fools not to have known trouble would come before long, and that it was the fault of the men, who were 
aware of it, that the women were thus forced to fly. 
In vain we pleaded that there was no warning, no 
means of foreseeing this; he cried, " You are ruined; 
</p><p>
so am I ; and my brothers, too ! And by there 
is nothing left but to die now, and I'll die ! " " Good ! " 
I said . "But die fighting for us ! " He waved his hand , 
black with powder, and shouted, "That I will!" 
after us. That was the only swearing guerrilla we 
met; the others seemed to have too much respect 
for us to talk loud. 
</p><p>
Lucy had met us before this ; early in the action, 
Lilly had sent her back to get some baby-clothes, 
but a shell exploding within a few feet of her, she 
took alarm, and ran up another road, for three miles, 
when she cut across the plantations and regained 
the Green well route. It is fortunate that, without 
consultation, the thought of running here should 
have seized us all.
