My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Your letters of the 25tli and 26th are both come 
yesterday to hand, which shows that the expresses 
have not made great despatch. I would have done 
myself the honor of writing to your Excellency, had 
I not every minute waited for intelligences from the 
southward. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency remembers that our shortest calculation for the arrival of the troops at the Head of 
Elk was for the 6th of March. I am happy to inform you that they will be there this day or to-morrow early; and notwithstanding the depth of the mud, 
and the extreme badness of the roads, this march, 
which I can call rapid (as, for example, they came 
in two days from <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>), has been 
performed with such an order and alacrity, that, 
agreeably to the report, two men only have been 
left behind, and yet these two men have embarked 
at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, with some remains of baggage. At every 
place where the detachment have halted, they have 
found covering and wood, &c., ready for them, and 
there has not been the least complaint made to me 
from any inhabitant. Every third day they have 
drawn their provisions. The clothing has been also 
distributed; and, having embarked yesterday at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, they passed the city about two o'clock, by a 
wind which was extremely favorable. Congress have 
given to our troops the advance of one month's pay, 
which will be distributed at the Head of Elk, in their 
emission. 
</p><p>
The artillery, consisting of one twenty-four, six 
eighteen, two brass twelve, one eight-inch howitzer, two eight-inch mortarSj in all twelve heavy pieces, 
four six-pounders, and two small howitzers, with a 
sufficient proportion of ammunition, will be at the 
Head of Elk this day and to-morrow; so that by the 
4th I hope we shall be ready to sail. A quantity 
of medicines and instruments, and fifteen hundred 
pairs of shoes, will be at the Head of Elk before we 
embark. Vessels will be in readiness to receive us 
with thirty days' provisions on board. I am also assured, that we shall have a sufficient quantity of 
boats to land the detachment; and two heavy scows 
will be added for the artillery. The public, and 
some of the private armed vessels in the Bay, have 
been ordered to the Head of Elk. Two despatchboats are there, and four more have been asked for. 
As a farther security for our subsistence, I have got 
the Minister's permission to dispose of the French 
flour and salt meat along the Bay, in case of necessity. 
</p><p>
On my arrival at this place I heard that M. de 
Tilly, the French Commander, had conferred with the 
Virginians, but upon seeing that nothing could be 
done immediately, he was undetermined whether to 
stay or return to Rhode Island. Fearing that our 
letters might miscarry, and wishing to hurry the 
preparations of the militia, I complied with the earnest solicitations of the Minister of France to send on 
Colonel Gouvion, and directed him to go thither by 
land or water, as the state of the Bay would permit, 
on board the French squadron, and afterwards to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague met'>Baron De Steuben</a>'s camp, where he may apprise 
these gentlemen of our force, our intentions, and the 
time of our arrival. 
</p><p>
This minute account I give to your Excellency to 
show you that nothing on our part has been wanting 
for the success of The expedition. Our preiDarations 
have, in every article, fulfilled, and in the most important one, time, have exceeded, what had been expected. Your letter was sent by express to <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, who immediately came to town. But nothing having been done for the settling of the accounts, none of the promises having been complied 
with, and the men being much scattered, it has, after 
much consideration, been thought impossible to embark any number with us ; and <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> promises to make every exertion for the sending of two 
or three hundred in a few days, whom, however, I 
am not to depend upon. 
</p><p>
I am myself going to the Head of Elk, and shall 
arrive there this evening. It has not been possible 
for me to leave sooner the city, as the three days I 
have remained here have been fully employed in 
making and forwarding preparations. Before I go I 
will wait on the Board of the Navy, and propose the 
sending of the frigates; but the Trumbull having not 
her complement of men, and those of the Ariel having mutinied at sea, I am afraid we shall find difficulties. 
</p><p>
The preparations made at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; the return 
of the Aminta; the remasting of the Bedford; the 
impossibility M. Destouches is under to give us any 
farther assistance ; the uncertainty of what M. de Tilly may have determined before he had received 
your letter ; â€” such are, my dear General, the many 
reasons which, from a pretty certain expedition, have 
lately made a very precarious one. Under these circumstances, indeed, there must always be more or 
less danger in going down the Bay, and venturing 
upon the low country about <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
</p><p>
Being unacquainted with the answer you have received from Count cle Rochambeaii and M. Destouches, I am not able to judge how far I may depend upon the same ship being ordered again to the 
Chesapeake, in case (before the reception of your 
letter) she had thought proper to sail. Her coming was not in consequence of your proposition ; her 
going was relative to the difficulties of an expedition 
very different from ours ; and I wish I might know, 
if, though M. Destouches cannot give further assistance, this assistance at least may be depended upon, 
so as to hope for the return of the ship, should M. de Tilly have left the Bay. The bottom of the Bedford is said to be damaged, the Aminta was said to 
have been dismasted. Suppose those circumstances 
were true, they would be in our favor. 
</p><p>
If a detachment was to go from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, west Point would be left in danger. If 
Cornwallis continues advancing, perhaps our being in 
the neighbourhood of Arnold may be of service. I 
will, however, confine myself literally to my instructions ; and if Colonel Gouvion writes mo with certaint}', that M. de Tilly is gone, if I am not led to suppose he will return, I will march back the detachment. For the present, I am going on, because, upon 
the increasing of the enemy's force at Gardiner's 
Bay, you recommend despatch to me. 
</p><p>
I hope, however, that I shall hear from your Excellency, now that the chain is established. Colonel 
Pickering says, that in six days I may receive your 
answer at the Head of Elk. The hope of seeing the 
French ship again, or some other reason, may detain 
me. But your answer will determine my motions; 
and I can receive it by the 8th, which is about the 
time when it was thouo;ht we should arrive at the 
Head of Elk. My expectations are not great, and I 
think we have hut few chances for us. I shall make 
all possible despatch, and listen particularly to the 
voice of prudence. However, some hazard must he 
run, if we undertake in these circumstances. 
</p><p>
General Duportail having not left this place, I am 
led to hope, that, if we do not go, I may return in 
time for the journey to Rhode Island. I most instantly beg, my dear General, you will favor me with 
an immediate answer. 
</p><p>
With the highest respect and most tender affection, 
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. One of our transports from <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> had got 
aground ; but the troops on board of her will still be 
in time at the Head of Elk. Some new difficulties 
have been made for the collecting of shoes, but I 
will try to get over them. From the extraordinary 
motions of Lord Cornwallis, whom we have not heard 
of these many days, and from the movements in New 
York, I am led to hope that I shall hear from you 
respecting my future conduct, and that I may be at 
head-quarters before you think it prudent to leave 
New Windsor.
