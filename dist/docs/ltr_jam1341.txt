</p><p>
DEAR SIR: I received, lately, your letter of June 2d, by Mr. Hainbly, 
at my farm in Loudoun, to which I had retired to await your report, and the 
return of your commissioners from Buenos Ayres. In reply to your letter, 
I shall express myself with the freedom and candor which I have invariably used in my communications with you. I shall withhold nothing in regard to your attack of the Spanish posts, and occupancy of them, particularly <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, which you ought to know, it being an occurrence of the 
most delicate and interesting nature, and which, without a circumspect and cautious policy, looking to all the objects which claim attention, may produce the most serious and unfavorable consequences. It is by a knowledge 
of all the circumstances, and a comprehensive view of the whole subject, 
that the danger to which this measure is exposed may be avoided, and all 
the good which you have contemplated by it, as I trust, be fully realised. 
</p><p>
In calling you into active service against the Seminoles, and communicating to you the orders which had been given just before to Gen. Gaines, 
the views and intentions of the Government were fully disclosed in respect 
to the operations in Florida. In transcending the limit prescribed by those 
orders, you acted on your own responsibility, on facts and circumstances 
which were unknown to the Government when the orders were given, 
many of which, indeed, occurred afterwards, and which you thought imposed on you the measure, as an act of patriotism, essential to the honor 
and interests of your country. 
</p><p>
The United States stand justified in ordering their troops into Florida in 
pursuit of their enemy. They have this right by the law of nations, if the 
Seminoles were inhabitants of another country, and had entered Florida to elude our pursuit. Being inhabitants of Florida, with a species of sovereignty over that part of the territory, and a right to the soil, our right to 
give such an order is the more complete and unquestionable. It is not an 
act of hostility to Spain. It is the less so, because her Government is bound 
by treaty to restrain by force of arms, if necessary, the Indians there from 
committing hostilities against the United States. 
</p><p>
But an order by the Government to attack a Spanish post would assume 
another character. It would authorize war, to which, by the principles of 
our constitution, the Executive is incompetent. Congress alone possess 
the power. I am aware that cases may occur, where the commanding general acting on his own responsibility, may with safety pass this limit, and 
with essential advantage to his country. The officers and troops of the 
neutral power forget the obligations incident to their neutral character; they 
stimulated the enemy to make war; they furnished them with arms and 
munitions of war to carry it on; they take an active part in other respects 
in their favor; they afford them an asylum on their retreat. The general 
obtaining victory pursues them to this post, the gates of which are shut 
against him; he attacks and carries it. and rests on those acts for his justification. The affair is then brought before his Government by the power 
whose post has been thus attacked and carried. If the Government whose 
officer made the attack had given an order for it, the officer would have no 
merit in it. He exercised no discretion, nor did he act on his own responsibility. The merit of the service, if there be any in it, would not be his. 
This is the ground on which this occurrence rests, as to his part. I will 
now look to the future. 
</p><p>
The foreign Government demands was this your act? or did you authorize it? I did not: it was the act of the general. He performed it for 
reasons deemed sufficient himself, and on his own responsibility. I demand, 
then, the surrender of the posts, and his punishment. The evidence justifying the conduct of the American general, and proving the misconduct 
of those officers, will be embodied, to be laid before the sovereign, as the 
ground on which their punishment will be expected. 
</p><p>
If the Executive refused to evacuate the posts, especially <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, it 
would amount to a declaration of war, to which it is incompetent. It would 
be accused with usurping the authority of Congress, and giving a deep and 
fatal wound to the constitution. By charging the offence on the officers of 
Spain, we take the ground which you have presented, and we look to you 
to support it. You must aid in procuring the documents necessary for this 
purpose. Those which you sent by Mr. Hambly were prepared in too 
much haste, and do not, I am satisfied, do justice to the cause. This must 
be attended to without delay. 
</p><p>
Should we hold the posts, it is impossible to calculate all the consequences likely to result from it. It is not improbable that war would immediately follow. Spain would be stimulated to declare it; and, once declared, 
the adventurers of Britain and other countries would, under the Spanish flag, privateer on our commerce. The immense revenue which we now 
receive would be much diminished, as would be the profits of our valuable 
productions. The war would probably soon become general; and we do not 
foresee that we should have a single power in Europe on our side. Why 
risk these consequences? The events which have occurred in both the Floridas show the incompetency of Spain to maintain her authority; and the 
progress of the revolutions in South America will require all her forces 
there. There is much reason to presume that this act will furnish a strong 
inducement to Spain to cede the territory, provided we do not wound too 
deeply her pride by holding it. If we hold the posts, her government 
cannot treat with honor, which, -by withdrawing the troops, we afford her 
an opportunity to do. The manner in which we propose to act, will exculpate you from censure, and promises to obtain all the advantages which you 
contemplated from the measure, and possibly very soon. From a different course no advantage would be likely to result, and there would be great danger of extensive and serious injuries, 
</p><p>
I shall communicate to you, in the confidence in which I write this letter, 
a copy of the answer which will be given to the Spanish minister, that you 
see distinctly the ground on which we rest, in the expectation that you 
will give it all the support in your power. The answer will be drawn on 
a view, and with attention to the general interests of our country, and its 
relations with other powers. 
</p><p>
A charge, no doubt, will be made of a breach of the Constitution; and, to 
such a charge, the public feeling will be alive. It will be said that you have 
taken all the power into your own hands, not from the executive alone, but 
likewise from Congress. The distinction which I have made above, between 
the act of the Government, refutes that charge. This act, as to the General, 
will be right, if the facts on which he rests made it a measure or necessity 
and they be well proved. There is no war, or breach of the Constitution, 
unless the Government should refuse to give up the posts; in which event,, 
should Spain embargo our vessels, and war follow, the charge of such breach 
would be laid against the Government with great force. The last imputation to which I would consent justly to expose myself, is that of infringing 
a Constitution, to the support of which, on pure .principles, my public life 
has been devoted. In this sentiment, I am satisfied, you fully concur. 
</p><p>
Your letters to the department were written in haste, under the pressure 
of fatigue and infirmity, in a spirit of conscious rectitude; and, in consequence, with less attention to some parts of their contents than would other 
wise have been bestowed on them. The passage to which I particularly allude, from memory, for I have not the letter before me, is that in which you 
speak of incompetency of an imaginary boundary to protect us against the 
enemy, being the ground on which you bottom all your measures. This is, 
liable to the imputation that you took the Spanish posts for that reason, as a , 
measure of expedience, and not on account of the misconduct of the Spanish officers. The effect of this and such passages, besides other objections 
to them, would be to invalidate the ground on which you stand, and furnish weapons to adversaries who would be glad to seize them. If you 
think proper to authorize the Secretary, or myself, to correct those passages, 
it will he done with care, though, should you have copies, as I presume 
you have, you had better do it yourself. 
</p><p>
The policy of Europe respecting South America is not yet settled. A 
congress of the allied powers is to be held this year, (November is spoken 
of,) to decide that question. England proposes to restore the colonies to 
Spain with free trade and colonial governments. Russia is less favorable, as 
are all the others. We have a Russian document, written by order of the 
Emperor, as the basis of instructions to his Ministers at the several courts, 
speaking of the British proposition favorably, but stating that it must be 
considered and decided on by the allies, and the result published, to produce a moral effect on the colonies, on the failure of which, force is spoken 
of. The settlement of the dispute between Spain and Portugal is made a preliminary. We partake in no councils whose object is not their complete independence. Intimations have been given us that Spain is not unwilling, 
and is even preparing for war with the United States, in the hope of making 
it general, and uniting Europe against us and her colonies, on the principle 
that she has no hope of saving them. Her pertinacious refusal to cede the 
Floridas to us heretofore, though evidently her interest to do it, gives some 
coloring to the suggestions. If we engage in a war, it is of the greatest importance that our people be united, and, with that view, that Spain commence 
it; and, above all, that the Government be free from the charge of c&lt;m?- 
pitting a breach of the Constitution. 
</p><p>
I hope that you have recovered your health. You see that the state of 
the world is unsettled, and that any future movement is likely to be directed 
against us. There may be very important occasions for your services, 
which Will be relied on. You must have the object in view, and be prepared 
to render them.
