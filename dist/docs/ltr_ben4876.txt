DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Last Night I received your Favour of the ig^ per Post, 
which I think is the best Conveyance for our Letters without 
any indirect Address; for I perceive that not only the little 
Piece which I sent on the 14 th Inst. but a long Letter of the 
8 th have miscarried. With the first I only thank'd you for 
the Square of nooo, & made a short Remark of some Imperfection I observ'd in it, and told you I had some where a 
square of 8, with the Diagonals you requir'd, w'' I would send 
you if I could find it. I also mentioned that I deferr'd 
sending the other Pieces you directed, till I should hear from 
you that the first was correct. Nevertheless they went the 
Week following, and I suppose have likewise miscarried. 
I shall write over again the Purport of my Letter of the 8'. b 
& send it with this. And as I pay no Postage here, I would 
request that for the future you would keep a little Ace' of 
what you pay there, and we will divide that Expence between 
us. Only I wish you to let me know how I may make 
my Letters cheapest, i.e. whether Letters are paid for in 
Paris according to their Weight, or according to the Number 
of Pieces of Paper as here.

Page 179 Binnacle, Boyer explains this under the Word 
Bittacle, which is the same thing, tho' the first is more agreable 
to the common Pronunciation. 
</p><p>
P. 209. it ought to be <a href='/results.php?year=1756'>1756</a>, and not <a href='/results.php?year=1754'>1754</a> 
</p><p>
P. 219. Acrement close, is a proper Name, the Name 
of a particular Field 
</p><p>
P. 225. It should be, a Point as at P. in Fig. 2. 
</p><p>
P. 231. What you say on the Fixing of Salt, may be put 
in a Note of the Translator. 
</p><p>
P. 253. after a warm Spell. Spell is a Vulgar English 
Word, therefore improper. It should have been after a 
warm Season. 
</p><p>
P. 266. there make another Note of the Translator. 
</p><p>
P. 278. A Surveyor's Chain meant here, is four Poles or 66 feet. 
</p><p>
P. 311. Outward Warmth It is not a "chaleur exterieure que Ton eprouve en entrant dans une Chambre pour 
y prendre le bain froid," that would indeed be unintelligible. 
As the Passage seems difficult, I have got my Clerk who is of 
French Extraction, to put it into his French, which perhaps 
you will understand better than my English.

I will as you desire send to Mess 6 Dilly & enquire for the 
Amer 11 Transactions. If it is not come there, I shall send you 
another by the first Opportunity. I am sure the President 
of that Society can have but one Objection to your translating their Book, which is, an Apprehension that the Sale of 
it will not pay for the Trouble & Expence of printing; 
and the Society must esteem it great Honour to them to 
enroll you among their foreign Members. 
</p><p>
I have not the least Objection to your making what Notes 
you please in the Translation. I only wish I could have the 
Advantage of seeing them before my new Edition is printed 
in English. 
</p><p>
M" e Biheron has been indisposed, but is now well again. 
We join in the Wishes of the Season for you & Mad e Dubourg. I am ever 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately
