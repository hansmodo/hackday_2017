Sir, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your Excellency's orders on the 19th 
instant to me, to take possession of the enemy's 
public stores pertaining to my department, I went to 
York myself, with my storekeeper, and at the same 
time desired Colonel Dearborn to go to Gloucester 
with an assistant of the storekeeper, for the purpose 
of receiving the stores. At Gloucester the dragoon horses, with their accoutrements, and the wagonhorses and wagons, were delivered up that day, and 
the whole committed by Colonel Dearborn to militia 
guards. The same evening the dragoon-horses were 
driven out of Gloucester, and delivered to the care 
of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Duke De Lauzun</a>'s legion ; and, by the inclosed 
certificate and oath of Major Bay ton, it appears that 
no exchanges were made between the receipt of 
those horses from the British, and the delivery of 
them to the Duke's legion. 
</p><p>
On the 20th I sent over the superintendent of 
the horse-yard with a party of men, and a written 
order to take charge of the cavalry-horses ; but Colonel Sheldon told my assistant, Mr. Mix, that they 
should retain the horses till there was an order from 
your Excellency to deliver them up. So the superintendent remained at Gloucester. During the 20th 
and 21st I had persons waiting at Gloucester to receive every species of property pertaining to my 
department, with a party of men for fatigue and 
guards. As soon as the prisoners left their tents on 
the 21st, Mr. Mix applied to the officer of the French 
guard, and told him his orders and business ; but he 
refused to let him take a tent, unless he could produce an order from your Excellency, Count Hochambeau, or General Choisy. The time would not admit 
of an application to either. Night came on, and the 
tents were chiefly stolen. In two hours, the persons 
I had assigned for that service would have had them 
in store. Early that morning I sent Mr. Mix with a 
note to head-quarters, mentioning the embarrassments 
given me by the French and militia guards. But 
your Excellency was gone to the fleet ; though Mr. 
Trumbull said you had previously written to General Choisy on the subject. 
</p><p>
Colonel Dearborn informs me, that a large proportion of the public stores thus lost (tents particularly) 
were taken away by the soldiers and women in the 
British hospitals; so that of one hundred and ten new 
tents returned in the eightieth regiment, only four 
or five were left. This information he received from 
the Quarter-master to that regiment. Some French 
soldiers were yesterday found there, loading two boats 
with tents. Colonel Dearborn's coming probably prevented their completing their design ; but, in defiance 
of him, they carried off what they had got. 
</p><p>
The French have placed safeguards over the houses 
at Gloucester, where the British officers are quartered; 
so that no American officer on duty there can obtain 
any shelter, unless in the vilest hovels. I conceive it 
to be absolutely necessary that these, and the French guards over the stores, be removed, as well as the 
guards of militia ; their places to be supplied, as far 
as shall be found necessary, by Continental troops. 
</p><p>
I request to be fivored with your Excellency's directions, respecting the public stores and tents carried 
off by the people in the British hospital. Colonel 
Dearborn will present this, and explain more circumstantially the proceedings at Gloucester. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
