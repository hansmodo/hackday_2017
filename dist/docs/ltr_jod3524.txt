IN the margin are the dates of all the letters I have received from you. I have written you several times that number. They are almost all lost, I suppose by 
yours. But you should consider, it is a different 
thing to have five hundred correspondents and but 
one. It is a different thing to be under an absolute 
restraint and under none. It would be an easy thing 
for me to ruin you and your children by an indiscreet 
letter, and what is more, it would be easy to throw 
our country into convulsions. For God's sake never 
reproach me again with not writing or with writing 
scrips. Your wounds are too deep. You know not, 
you feel not the dangers that surround me, nor those 
that may be brought upon our country. Millions 
would not tempt me to write you as I used. I have 
no security that every letter I write you will not be 
broken open, and copied, and transmitted to Congress 
and to English newspapers. They would find no 
treason nor deceit in them, it is true, but they would 
find weakness and indiscretion, which they would 
make as ill a use of.

There are spies upon every word I utter, and every 
syllable I write. Spies planted by the English, spies 
planted by stockjobbers, spies planted by selfish 
merchants, and spies planted by envious and malicious politicians. I have been all along aware of this, 
more or less, but more so now than ever. PJy life 
has been often in danger, but I never considered my 
reputation and character so much in danger as now. 
I can pass for a fool, but I will not pass for a dishonest or a mercenary man. Be upon your guard, there 
fore. I must be upon mine, and I will.
