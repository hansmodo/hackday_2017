My Dear Brother : You will perceive from the date of 
this letter that I am in the capital of gaiety, and such I 
have found it. This city is a striking contrast to any 
I have ever seen. If there are unhappy people here, I 
have not seen them. The streets are alive with people, 
and bands are playing in the gardens and palaces. Groups 
are gathered around singing-stalls, the cafes and restaurants are filled, and the broad p<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=rome" rel="city">Rome</a>nades are encroached 
upon by persons sitting in front of the cafes, sipping 
coffee, etc. I have now been here eight days, and if I 
was to select a happy city, judging only from appearances, there could be no rival with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. 
</p><p>
I know very well, from the history of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>ians, 
that a sudden impulse would change them into tigers, 
and that the gayest spots have been the scenes of frightful cruelties, but surely they seem happy now. I have 
been constantly contrasting the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> with the 
English : the conclusion is all in favor of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>ians. 
</p><p>
I was in Great Britain seven weeks ; went into England, 
Ireland, Scotland, and. Wales. I saw all I was allowed 
to see, without prejudice, with, a sincere desire to improve 
my limited time. As a matter of course, I could not 
give you reasons or ideas on facts gathered on the way. 
The mere journal of places, men, and sights seen would 
be a very poor guide-book. My conclusions are all 
against the British Government. . . . When Englishmen hereafter talk about their rights, I will know what 
they mean. They do enjoy a limited liberty of speech 
and of the press, and then you have said all. It is a 
government of the aristocracy, more exclusive, repelling, 
and narrow than I conceived of. The House of Commons is the only pretended representation of the people, 
and that is but a mere pretence. The representation is 
so glaringly unequal that it is a surprise to me that the 
people will submit to it. As the members are not paid, 
and none can vote without property, it is a mere representation of money and not of men. Every regulation 
of the government, the rules of caste, the combined 
insolence and obsequiousness of all classes with whom 
I came in contact, were so unpleasant to me that, while 
my visit there was a constant enjoyment and a school, 
I would not live under the British Government for any 
consideration. . . . Without this detail, this is my idea 
of the British Government, and if time and space united 
allowed, I could state the facts and observations that, 
little by little, led to this conclusion ; but I will leave 
that for some long talk when time is not so precious. 
</p><p>
The cultivated scenery of England fully met my expectations. I can imagine nothing more beautiful than 
their hawthorn-hedge fields, their cattle and sheep, and 
indeed everything that depends on care and cultivation. 
The idea that all this stock and property belonged to a 
few, that the great mass of the people merely labored 
for others, and that the whole government was conducted 
and a system of laws passed simply to continue and 
intensify this state of things, and that the favored 
class had the possession of all the powers of government, securely hedged about, made me a rebel from the 
beginning. 
</p><p>
I was present at the great debate in the House of 
Commons, when the ministry was overthrown upon questions utterly insignificant, and I could not but wish that 
I was a member of that body for ten years, with full 
power to introduce and discuss several measures of 
reform, to bring to the people of England equal representation, based upon men and not upon property or 
boroughs, a law against entailment, and a law of descent 
and distribution, which would divide property among 
children equally. The discussion of such radical measures could not but convince intelligent men. But what 
then ? Neither the intelligence nor population of England is represented in Parliament, and a favored class 
have never yielded power except to revolution or the 
fear of it. 
</p><p>
The French government is much more tolerable. 
Louis <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=napoleon" rel="city">Napoleon</a> is emperor by usurpation, but I really 
think that the government is not only for the good, but 
is the choice of the people and others. There is the 
greatest personal liberty and equality here, and the 
institutions tend to advance equality and give a fair 
chance to merit. It is true that through the press people 
cannot discuss p'olitics, except on one side. In private 
life, and indeed in the saloons and public places, there 
seems no restraint. The administration of the law 
seems well conducted. Taxes, as compared with England, are light, and the Frenchman has no restraint, 
either by caste or law, from doing what he wishes, 
except that he must iiot write against the government. 
His equality with his neighbor is recognized. There is 
more freedom, if I might say so, more mixing of all classes 
of people here, and on terms of kindliness and equality, 
than you will find even in America. The blouses, the 
uniforms, and the black coats all sit and eat and chat 
together. On the whole, they have much more claim to 
be a " free people " than the English, and hereafter I 
will know how to appreciate an English account of 
French tyranny. 
</p><p>
But enough of this. I received two of your letters 
with great pleasure. Through friends and the papers to 
be found here, in many places, I am kept well advised 
of the American matters. 
</p><p>
My travels have given me a fund of information that 
I could get in no other way. I think I will never regret 
the trip. I leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> to-morrow for Milan and the 
seat of war ; thence we visit Switzerland and the Rhine, 
returning here in time to take the boat leaving Havre 
August 3d for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. I regret to return so soon, 
but business demands it. 
</p><p>
I will be on the field of Magenta and Montebello, and 
if possible, on the present theatre of action. Eemember 
me to all, and believe me to remain 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother, 
</p><p>
