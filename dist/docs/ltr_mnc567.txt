My dear sir
</p><p>
Tho I have not heard from you since you carried my effects to your ware house yet presume you got every thing mentioned in the list which & of which Miss Williams sent you a copy - I fear they were all in a very delapidated state & not of much value to any one but myself - I have written to Miss P to select to me articles which I would like you to send to me here & the pictures will have to be very carefully packed. Direct them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="spouse met">Genl R. E. Lee</a> Lexington Va. Either via Lynchburgh care of Echols & Co, or if you think better via Richmond care of A Caskie & Brothers @ - I suppose it would not be well to send large a package by Express nor do I know if the National is operating.
</p><p>
(Page 2 ) We shall receive the articles more quickly via Lynchburgh from whence they will be sent here by canal & now sir will you send me a bill of the expenses you have incurred in removing these things - & if that beaufet could be sold for anything like its value I would be willing that you should repair & sell it also the circular dining tables otherwise they had best remain as they are for the present - until we see what our future will be - All is now so dark & uncertain that it seems almost useless to make any arrangements except from day to day - I hope old Alexa will revive & you will present my kind regards to your father & family especially your brother Stephen -
</p><p>
& believe me yrs respectfully

I meant the things to be sent by freight cars to Lynchburgh
