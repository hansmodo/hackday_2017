Sir, 
</p><p>
By Mr. James Morris, who sailed in the May packet, I transmitted you a letter from the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, at the same time informing you that 
the Marquis had intrusted to my charge the key of the Bastille, and a drawing of that prison, as a 
present to your Excellency. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague met'>Mr. J. Rutledge</a>, Jr. had intended coming in the ship. <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> and I had chosen that opportunity for the purpose of transmitting the present ; but the ship not 
sailing at the time appointed, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Rutledge</a> takes his passage in the packet, and I have committed to 
his care those trophies of liberty, which I know it will give you pleasure to receive. The French revolution is not only complete, but triumphant ; and the 
envious disposition of this nation is compelled to own the magnanimity with which it has been conducted. 
</p><p>
The political hemisphere is again clouded by a dispute between England and Spain ; the circumstances 
of which you will hear before this letter can arrive. A messenger was sent from hence the 6th instant 
to Madrid, with very peremptory demands, and to wait there only forty-eight hours. His return has 
been expected for two or three days past. I was this morning at the Marquis del Campo's ; but nothing is yet arrived. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Rutledge</a> sets off at four 
o'clock this afternoon ; but, should any news arrive before the making up the mail on Wednesday, June 2d, I will forward it to you under cover. 
</p><p>
The views of this Court, as well as of the nation, so far as they extend to South America, are not for the purpose of freedom, but conquest. They already 
talk of sending some of the young branches to reign over them, and to pay off their national debt with 
the produce of the mines. The bondage of those countries will, as far as I can perceive, be prolonged by what this Court has in contemplation. 
</p><p>
My bridge is arrived, and I have engaged a place to erect it in. A little time will determine its fate; but I yet see no cause to doubt of its success, 
though it is very probable that a war, should it break out, will, as in all new things, prevent its progress, so far as regards profits. 
</p><p>
In the partition, in the box which contains the key of the Bastille, I have put up half a dozen razors, manufactured from cast-steel, made at the works 
where the bridge was constructed, which I request you to accept as a little token from a very grateful heart. I received, about a week ago, a letter from 
Mr. G. Clymer. It is dated the 4th of February, but has been travelling ever since. I request you to acknowledge it for me, and that I will answer it when 
my bridge is erected. With much affection to all my friends, and many wishes to see them again, I am, 
Sir, your much 
</p><p>
Obliged and obedient, humble servant.
