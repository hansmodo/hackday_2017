Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency at Guilford Court-House, 
giving you an account of our situation, and of the 
measures advised by the Council of War, since which 
time we have been manoeuvring constantly in the 
face of the enemy, who pressed our rear every day. 
</p><p>
Finding our numbers and condition so unequal to 
the enemy, that it would be too hazardous to risk a 
general action, and being pressed in point of time to 
get off our stores and baggage, notwithstanding I 
had ordered it to file off for Hillsborough when the 
army began their march from Pedee, and the stores 
from Hillsborough to cross the Roanoke the moment 
I could satisfy myself that it was the intention of 
Lord Cornwallis to penetrate the upper country, â€” to 
gain time to effect this business, as well as give the 
militia an opportunity to collect, I found it necessary 
to form as strong a covering party as possible, which 
was commanded by Colonel Williams, who had orders to keep as near The enemy as lie could, without exposing the party too much, and retard their march 
all in his power. His conduct upon the occasion 
does him the highest honor. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis has been at our heels from day to 
day ever since we left Guilford; and our movements 
from thence to this place have been of the most critical kind, having a river in our front, and the enemy 
in our rear. But, happily, we have crossed without the 
loss of either men or stores. Much credit is due to 
Lieutenant-Colonel Carrington on this occasion. The 
enemy are on the other side of the river, and, as it 
is falling, I expect it will be fordable before night; 
and the fords are so numerous, and the enemy lie in 
such an advantageous situation for crossing, that it 
would be a folly to think of defending them, as it 
would reduce our force to small parties, which might 
prove our ruin. The miserable situation of the troops, 
for want of clothing, has rendered the march the 
most painful imaginable, several hundreds of the soldiers tracking the ground with their bloody feet. 
Your feelings for the suffering soldier, had you been 
here, must have been pained upon the occasion. 
</p><p>
The enemy's movements have been so rapid, and 
the country under such terror, that few or no militia 
have joined us, and the greater part we had have 
fallen off. Inclosed I send your Excellency the 
strength of the British army, which you will see 
is much stronger than I had calculated upon in my 
last. This account I believe may be depended upon, 
though I have not a shilling of money to obtain intelligence, notwithstanding my application to Maryland for money for this particular service ; and your 
Excellency knows that good intelligence is the soul 
of an army, and ought to govern all its movements. 
</p><p>
I have done every thing to call out the militia of 
the upper country, and have kept Governors Nash 
and Jefferson as regularly advised of the state of 
matters, as time and circumstances would permit. Nothing is yet done to give me effectual support; and 
I am not a little apprehensive that it is out of the 
power of Virginia and North Carolina to afford it. 
I must repeat again what I have said in several letters, that I fear nothing can save the Southern States 
but a good regular army ; and I am more confirmed 
of the importance of the cavalry upon this occasion 
than ever I have been, though strongly impressed 
with it before. 
</p><p>
Should Lord Cornwallis cease his pursuit after this 
army, I imagine he will file off for <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, and endeavour to establish a post there ; to prevent which 
I have sent Colonel Kosciuszko to fortify it. That 
position would greatly awe Virginia, and almost totally subject North Carolina. If we can prevent his 
taking post there, and oblige him to fill down into 
the lower country, he will reap little advantage from 
his movements. I wish it was in my power to give 
your Excellency more flattering accounts from this 
quarter; but I fear, unless reenforcements come from 
the northward, this will prove a devoted country. 
However, my utmost exertions shall be continued to 
save these States, and I shall be happy, if my conduct meets with your approbation, as my situation 
affords me no prospect of personal glory. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant-Colonel Lee made a charge upon the 
enemy's advanced party, a few days since, and cut 
off the greater part of them. A captain and several 
privates were made prisoners. The enemy move with 
great caution, though with great rapidity, frequently 
performing marches of thirty miles a day. Myself 
and my Aids are almost -worn out with fatigue, which 
prevents my giving you more frequent and particular 
accounts of our movements. Our army are in good 
spirits, notwithstanding their sufferings and excessive 
fatigue. I have had no further accounts from Wilmino'ton or the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> since I wrote. 
I am, with great respect, yours, &c.,
