Private. 
</p><p>
SIR : 
</p><p>
One of the favorite objects of this government is an increase of the dominions in the East and West Indies. A 
formidable expedition with 25,000 troops has recently sailed 
for the latter, but has already met with two gales of wind 
extremely violent, which have damaged many of the vessels, 
and reduced considerably the numbers of men that go together. It has also been delayed in its departure at least 
three months later than was intended. It appears to be the 
general opinion here that it must inevitably succeed, that 
its force will be irresistible, and the whole island of St. Domingo is already in possession of this country by anticipation. Yet if it should fail, Englishmen may remember 
that it will not be the first instance of an invincible armada 
defeated, and considering the climate to which they are 
going the loss of three months of the season may be considered as equivalent to the loss of half of their men. 
</p><p>
That they may succeed is not I think to be wished by 
Americans. For, Sir, it appears more and more clear that 
the real and ultimate object of this government in their 
present war, is to establish the commercial and maritime 
supremacy of the nation over the ruins of those of France. 
They have hitherto been so far successful in this project, 
that they are encouraged vigorously to pursue it, and if they 
can terminate the war by obtaining possession of Corsica, 
of the Cape of Good Hope, and of Martinico, with their own 
navy greatly increased, and that of France equally reduced, 
they will have gone very far towards securing their purpose. 
It is intimated by the ministerial partisans that little hesitation will be made here at giving up the Austrian Netherlands, and even the cause of the Stadtholder in the United 
Provinces, provided an indemnity shall be given to this country by an accession to its transmarine possessions. I have 
very little doubt of the fact, because the sacrifice of allies 
and the abandonment of solemn previous stipulations, would 
operate only as a removal of the mask, as soon as the purpose 
for which it was taken has been secured. 
</p><p>
It is not merely from views of commercial aggrandizement, however, that the posession of the French islands in 
the West Indies is held as an object of the first magnitude 
in this country. It enters into all their calculations relative 
to the United States. It forms a part of their defensive 
system, and they believe that their commercial existence 
depends in some measure upon the event. This may serve 
as a clue to the extreme anxiety which they have uniformly 
discovered since the commencement of this war to exclude 
the Americans not only from their own, but from all the 
foreign islands. It explains the orders of the 6th of November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1793">1793</a>. It accounts for their obstinate adherence to 
that clause in the 12th article of the late treaty, which has 
been suspended. It is the key to that singular principle 
which they are now determined on their single authority to 
establish as the settled law of nations, that no other than the 
customary peace trade can be allowed to neutral nations, by 
a belligerent party in time of war. Anything that shall 
serve as a barrier between the United States and the West 
Indies will be attempted by them, and in addition to all 
their other grounds of alarm, they are now apprehensive 
that if France should retain her islands at the peace, she will 
be compelled, by her own want of navigation, to leave the 
intercourse between them and the United States as free to 
the latter as it has been since this war, and that she will be 
unable to resume the exclusive system at least for several 
years. The genius of the navigation act shudders at the 
prospect, and will think thousands of mere human lives, and 
millions of treasure, most profitably spent in preventing the reality. 
</p><p>
But, as Mr. Hammond says, it is impossible for them to 
think of everything, and they sometimes find themselves 
obliged to yield to an irresistible course of events. I am 
sensible how dangerous a thing it is to deliver an opinion 
upon future occurrences, else I would venture to foretell 
that whatever commercial negotiations may at any time be 
carried on between the United States and Britain, what 
ever is given by the latter will be extorted by the necessity 
of the times, and nothing will be conceded to any liberality 
of system. There is no such thing as commercial liberality in the country. To engross the commerce of the world to 
themselves is the professed or secret wish of every heart 
among them, and if there are a very small number who believe that the prosperity of other nations would rather ad 
vance than prejudice their own, the effect of this opinion 
is destroyed by the political consideration that their views 
would not be secured by their own positive advantage, with 
out a correspondent negative for all other nations. The 
character of the former supposition is equality, but all 
their" ideas run towards their superiority. 
</p><p>
It is, therefore, a circumstance very remarkable that at 
this time there is before the Privy Council a proposal for 
admitting into the ports of this country the produce of 
foreign West India Islands, in neutral vessels rum, sugar, 
coffee and cocoa, for re-exportation, and cotton and molasses 
for consumption here. The merchants appear to be of 
opinion that this will soon be permitted by proclamation, 
and if so the present would certainly be a favorable moment 
to us for negotiation upon this subject. But what has induced them to be prepared for a regulation so different from 
the spirit of the condition to the 2th article of the treaty? 
It is because their adherence to their own system has driven 
the Americans into another course of trade, from which it 
has not been practicable to exclude them : because that other 
course of trade not only tends to carry their custom else 
where, but to give them the means and opportunity of tracing 
new channels for their commerce : because the merchants of 
this country are losing their American commissions, and 
ten per cent of profit upon the whole balance of the trade in 
the rate of exchange ; in short, because their own apparent 
interest forces them to an indulgence equally adverse to 
their feelings and their principles. But if they can obtain 
possession of the French Islands, then the old maxims of exclusion will be revived in all their force, and instead of 
resigning themselves to a mere participation of our profits, 
they will boldly resume the purpose of intercepting them from us. 
</p><p>
The scarcity of grain has still an appearance so alarming, 
that the Parliament besides many regulations to reduce the 
consumption have also encouraged its importation by a bounty 
upon wheat, and upon Indian corn. It was at first proposed to make a distinction, so as to give a larger bounty on 
the importations from the Mediterranean, than on those 
from America ; but they were finally put upon the same 
footing. The wants of Europe during the ensuing year will 
undoubtedly turn to the benefit of the United States as much 
as they have ever yet done, but on their part they must not 
suffer their patience to be yet exhausted. The American 
will infallibly triumph over the European system eventually, 
provided it be pursued with as much perseverance. But an 
hour of haste or resentment indulged in at the present moment would take the advantage which it now possesses from 
its hand, and throw the scale of probable success on this side of the water. 
</p><p>
All my letters to you, Sir, public and private, have delivered my sentiments with a freedom which perhaps needs 
an apology, and which certainly nothing but an unlimited confidence can reconcile with personal prudence. A sense 
of duty it is hoped will be admitted at least as my excuse, and if my opinions are in any instance warped by prejudice, I 
am persuaded that your discernment will distinguish, and hope your candor will overlook them. I remain, etc.
