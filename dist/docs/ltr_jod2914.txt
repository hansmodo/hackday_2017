THERE is a clock calm at this time in the political and military hemispheres. The surface is smooth and the air serene. Not a breath nor a wave, no news nor noise.

Nothing would promote our cause more than Howe's march to this town. Nothing quickens and determines people so much as a little smart. The Germans, who are numerous and wealthy in this State, and who have very imperfect ideas of freedom, have 
a violent attachment to property. They are passionate and vindictive, in a degree that is scarcely credible to persons who are unacquainted with them, and 
the least injury to their property excites a resentment beyond description. A few houses and plantations 
plundered, (as many would be if Howe should come here,) would set them all on fire. Nothing would 
unite and determine Pennsylvania so effectually. The passions of men must cooperate with their reason in the prosecution of a war. The public may be 
clearly convinced, that a war is just, a.id yet, until their passions are excited, will carry it languidly on. 
The prejudices, the anger, the hatred of the English against the French contributes greatly to their valor 
and success. The British court and their officers hove studied to excite the same passions in the breasts of their soldiers against the Americans, well knowing 
their powerful effects. We, on the contrary, have treated their characters with too much tenderness. 
The Howes, their officers, and soldiers too, ought to be held up to the contempt, derision, hatred and abhorrence of the populace in every State, and of the 
common soldiers in every army. It would give me no pain to sec them burned or hanged in effigy, in every town and village.
