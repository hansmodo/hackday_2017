Another week of good sailing ends with this evening, and should we be thus favored four or five weeks more, we will be safely landed again on terra firma. This morning the boys were good humoredly playing tricks upon each other by cutting out a rag the shape of a rat and coating it over with chalk and then slyly pressing it upon the back of some one. One of the Frenchmen, a comical old fellow, playfully experimented thus on one of his countrymen, rather a foppish sort of a customer, who took offence at the joke and proceeded forthwith to use his fists. The old man was also prepared and showed battle. They each struck one and then came to the floor, when they were separated and the riot quelled.

Yesterday morning one of the ladies playfully took a bottle of brandy out of Charley's trunk, and as he expressed much concern about it today, the lady handed it back to him. The boys seized the opportunity to bone him for a treat, but he being a little sulky and not relishing the joke very well, threw the contents of the bottle into the sea. Since then they have plagued him with a tenfold vigor.

At the dinner table today in the upper cabin another fracas occurred. It appears some words were exchanged between Mr. Sterling and Mr. Murphy at the breakfast table, but things rested without any further difficulty until the parties sat down to the dinner table, when the feud was renewed. Mr. Murphy seized the carving knife and made at Mr. Sterling. Mr. S., being unarmed, made his escape from the cabin while others were engaged in wresting the knife from Mr. M. Before the knife could be taken from him, he cut Mr. Holland slightly on the hand, and Mr. Platt also received a middling severe wound in the hand.

Thursday the sky was unclouded for the first time since we left Valparaiso, and I have heard it said that where these southeast winds prevail it is seldom clear. On that day I was twenty-one years of age, the period I was anxiously looking forward to a short year ago while laboring at the case in the old Record office, as I then thought it would give me more unbounded liberty. But this wished-for liberty came some six months since, and my twenty-first birthday has been spent on the broad rolling Pacific where I have little desire to pass another.

Last evening we were surrounded by hundreds of black porpoises and for a long while endeavored to harpoon them without success, but we caught a large fish, called by the seamen a "bonetta." Yesterday we saw a large school of flying fish, the first we have seen on the Pacific. They are becoming quite numerous again. We have been fishing, but the large hawks that are now in our vicinity are more expert at it than ourselves, for they dart down from a great height and seize the little flying fish as they rise up out of the
water and endeavor to escape from the claws of their large neighbors. Very few birds are to be seen.
