Capt. Montgomery did send an Amer. flag by Lieut. Revere then in Command of Sonoma, and some dispatches to Fremont, I received the Order to hist the flag by Sunrise from Lt. Revere. Long time before daybreak, I got ready with loading the Canons and when it was day the roaring of the Canons got the people all stirring. Some them made long faces, as they thought if the Bear flag would remain there would be a better chance to rob and plunder. Capt. Fremont received Orders to proceed to Monterey with his forces, Capt. Montgomery provided for the upper Country, established Garrisons in all important places, Yerba buena, Sonoma, San Jose, and fort Sacramento. Lieut. Missroon came to organize our Garrison better and more Numbers of white Men and Indians of my former Soldiers, and gave me the Command of this Fort. The Indians have not yet received their pay yet for their services, only each one a shirt and a pre. of pants, & abt. 12 men got Coats. So went the War on in California. Capt. Fremont was nearly all time engaged in the lower Country and made himself Governor, until Genl. Kearny arrived, when an other Revolution took place. And Fremont for disobeying Orders was made prissoner by Genl. Kearny, who took him afterwards with him to the U. States by Land across theMountains.
