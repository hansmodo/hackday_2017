TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>, Oct. 24th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1793">1793</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 14th Inst. did not arrive till 
Sunday night, and being not then at home, I did not receive it 
till last night. I now lose not a moment in complying with its 
request; tho' I foresee it cannot reach you before you will have 
left Mount Yernon, and before you will probably have made up 
a final determination on some, if not all the questions proposed. 
These are: 
</p><p>
1. Ought the President to summon Congress at a time and 
place to be named by him ? or, 
</p><p>
2. If the President has no power to change the place, ought 
he to abstain from all interposition whatever ? or, 
</p><p>
3. Ought he to notify the obstacle to a meeting at Philad a , 
state the defect of a regular provision for the exigency, and 
suggest his purpose of repairing to a place deemed most eligible for a meeting in the first instance ? 
</p><p>
4. What is the place liable to the fewest objections ? 
</p><p>
From the best investigation I have been able to make in so 
short a time, the first expedient, tho' most adequate to the exigency, seems to require an authority that does not exist under 
the Constitution and laws of the U. S. 
</p><p>
The only passage in the Constitution in which such an authority could be sought is that which says: "The President 
may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either 
of them." But the obvious import of these terms is satisfied by 
referring them to the time only at which the extraordinary 
meeting is summoned. If, indeed, they included a discretion as 
to the place as well as the time, it would be unnecessary to recur to the expedient of altering the time in order to get at an 
alteration of the place. The President could as well alter the 
place without interfering with the time, as alter the time without interfering with the place. Besides, the effect of a change 
as to place would not be in all respects similar to a change as 
to time. In the latter case, an extraordinary Session, running 
into the period of an ordinary one, would allow the ordinary 
one to go on under all the circumstances prescribed by law. In 
the former case, this would not happen. The ordinary part of 
the Session would be held out of the place prescribed .for it, 
unless prevented by a positive act for returning to it. 
</p><p>
The obvious meaning here assigned to the phrase is confirmed 
by other parts of the Constitution. It is well known that much 
jealousy has always appeared in everything connected with the 
residence of the General Government. The solicitude of the 
Constitution to appease this jealousy is particularly marked by 
the 1 st paragraph of section 6 th , and the 3 d paragraph of section 
the 7 th , of Article I. The light in which these paragraphs must 
be viewed cannot well be reconciled with a supposition that it 
was meant to entrust the executive alone with any power on 
that subject. 
</p><p>
Laying aside the Constitution and consulting the law, the expedierrt seems to be no lees inadmissible. The act of July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1790">1790</a>, 
" establishing the temporary and permanent seat of the Government of the U. S," cannot be understood to leave any such 
power in the President. And as the power, if exercised so as 
to interfere with the provision relating to the temporary seat, 
might beget an alarm, lest, in the hands of a President unfriendly 
to the permanent seat, it should be turned on some pretext or 
other against that arrangement, prudential reasons unite with 
legal ones for avoiding the precedent. 
</p><p>
The 2 d mode of treating the difficulty would seem to be best, 
if the danger at Germantown were out of the way. A voluntary resort to that place might be relied on; and the members 
of the Legislature, finding themselves together and with the 
President, might legalize the necessary steps; or, if that should 
be thought wrong, might deliberate and decide for themselves 
on the emergency. But as the danger might defeat such an expectation, it results that the 
</p><p>
3 d expedient is called for by the occasion; and being sufficient, 
is all that can be justified by it. 
</p><p>
The 4 th point to be considered is the delicate one of naming 
the place. 
</p><p>
In deciding this point, it would seem proper to attend, first, 
to the risk of the infection; this consideration lies, as you observ. against Trenton and Wilmington. Secondly, to Northern 
and Southern jealousies. This applies to N. York and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>. Thirdly, to the disposition of Pennsyl a ; which is entitled 
to some regard, as well by her calamity as by the circumstance 
of her being in possession of the Government. 
</p><p>
In combining these considerations, we are led to look for some 
place within the State of Pennsyl* not materially diiferent from 
Philad a in relation to North and South. Lancaster and Reading appear to have occurred. With the former I am but little 
acquainted. The latter I never saw. If the object of the Executive should be merely to put Congress in the most neutral 
situation possible for choosing a place for themselves, as would 
have been the case at Germantown, Reading seems to have the 
better pretensions. If the object should be to provide a place, 
at once marking an impartiality in the Executive, and capable 
of retaining Congress during the Session, Lancaster seems to 
claim a preference. 
</p><p>
If the measure which my present view of the subject favors 
should be deemed least objectionable, something like the following form might be given to it: 
</p><p>
Whereas a very dangerous and infectious malady, which 
continues to rage in the City of Philad a , renders it indispensable that the approaching Session of Congress should be held, 
as well as the Executive Department be for the present administered, at some other place; And whereas no regular provision exists for such an emergency, so that, unless some other 
place be pointed out at which the members of Congress may 
assemble in the first instance, great embarrassments may happen; under these peculiar circumstances, I have thought it incumbent on me to notify the obstacle to a meeting of Congress 
at the ordinary place of their Session, and to recommend that the several members assemble on the day appointed at , 
in the State of , at which place I shall be ready to meet them.
