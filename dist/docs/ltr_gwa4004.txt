Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Among the number of your friends, permit me also to 
congratulate you, and my country, on your late honourable 
and important appointment. Be assured, sir, that my 
pleasure on this occasion, though it may be equalled, cannot 
be exceeded by that of any other. 
</p><p>
I do most sincerely wish you a pleasant and agreeable 
passage, the most perfect and honourable accomplishment 
of your ministry, and a safe return to the bosom of a grateful country. 
</p><p>
With the greatest regard, and sincerest personal attachment, I have the honour to be, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and 
</p><p>
Affectionate humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="me">George Washington<a/>.
