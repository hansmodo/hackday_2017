Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr. Thomas Hancock delivered to me yesterday your 
obliging letter of the 23d of last month. I shall always be 
happy in opportunities of manifesting to the family of the 
late Governor Hancock, my respect for his memory. We 
were fellow-labourers in the American revolution, and I 
reflect with pleasure on the good understanding which subsisted between us, and the friendly attentions with which 
he uniformly honoured me. Permit me to add, that my 
esteem and regard for you would not only ensure a welcome 
reception to this amiable young gentleman, but to any others 
you may recommend. 
</p><p>
The approbation of one judicious and virtuous man, relative to the conduct of the negotiations in which I was 
lately engaged, affords me more satisfaction, than all the 
clamours raised on that subject by intrigue and passion 
have given me concern. It was foreseen that a strenuous 
opposition would be excited ; and I was disappointed only 
in this, that the management of it has been less circumspect 
and politic than I had supposed. There was little reason 
to expect that any treaty of amity with Great Britain, 
which our constituted L r *>vernment could form, would be 
acceptable to those anti-federalists, whose prejudices, instead 
of being removed, but gathered strength and malignity 
from the failure of their predictions ; to debtors, anxious 
by any means to elude payment, or to partisans of a 
foreign power, which had systematically and industriously 
laboured to keep us in the condition of a satellite, and prevent our ever diverging from the sphere of her attraction 
and governing influence. 
</p><p>
Believing the people of this country too intelligent to be 
long deceived, and not sufficiently vicious to require great 
national calamities, I hope and trust that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> will 
continue to bless us with as much prosperity as will be 
good for us ; I say as will be good for us, for in my opinion 
Agur's prayer is not less suitable for nations than for 
individuals. With the best wishes for your health and 
happiness, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
