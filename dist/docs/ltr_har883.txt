SAN FRANCISCO, October 20th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>.
</p><p>
The more I see of this city the more I am surprised with its peculiarities, nationalities, and novelties. It is a modern Rome, built on not only seven, but seventy times seven hills. Some of these hills are large, and composed of granite; but the most of them are conical sand-hills, which have been drifted into strange and novel shapes by the prevailing winds, and which are constantly increasing or diminishing, at the will of the freakish and invisible spirits that mould them. In many parts of the city nearly every lot is, or was, prior to the grade, encumbered with a sand-hill. The grading often costs more than the lot. The large sand-hills are removed by steam shovels, and cars that run on temporary railways, constructed for the purpose. In this way, deep valleys are filled up by the deposit, and new lots made. In fact, it has cost about as much to grade the city as to build
it. Lots seem to go and come with the wind.
</p><p>
The windmills give to the general appearance of the city a feature that is as singular as it is repulsive to architectural taste. They are erected for the purpose of pumping water from wells to irrigate the lawns and gardens, and consist of a frame tower twenty of thirty feet high, surmounted with a circular tank, and a fan-wheel which revolves in the wind, working a force-pump, that supplies water to the tank, whence it is conducted in pipes, or open flumes, to every part of the lawn or garden. By this means the grounds occupied for residences are kept green, and the gardens made productive, the year round. Those citizens who neglect to irrigate, reside in sandy deserts, just the size of their respective lots, during the dry season, which continues for seven or eight months of the year. The poorer classes cannot afford the luxury of irrigation, and consequently the town plat for two thirds of the year looks like a chequer board, or patch bed-quilt.
</p><p>
The commercial part of the city is located along the Bay, and built up in magnificent style, in blocks of stone, brick, and iron, three and four stories high, and equal to the best business streets in the eastern cities. Most of the buildings are anchored or braced with iron bolts, so as to secure them against the action of earthquakes.
</p><p>
The ground in this part of the town is level, being made-land by grading the sand-hills into the bay. By this process some five hundred acres have been reclaimed from the sea, and are now quite densely occupied. The wholesale and retail stores are not only imposing in the fronts they present, but largely stocked with every variety of goods and products gathered from every clime. The churches and other public buildings, are generally characterized by a corresponding grandeur and magnificence. The principal hotels are spacious and fitted up in elegant style, and conducted on a scale of liberality, not to say extravagance, which would astonish you.
</p><p>
There is no city on the face of the globe, I think, in which the leading business men exhibit so much activity and intensity of purpose, so much rushing ahead in the streets, as in San Francisco. The business streets, from morning till night, are crowded with passing drays, and men stepping on each other's heels, and jostling elbows at every angle, as if life were at stake. And more especially is this true on steamer days, so called from the sailing of the Panama steamers every two weeks, when all merchants are expected to settle balances with each other. In doing this an unusual bustle is created in the streets and in the banks; hundreds of men are seen bearing hither and thither
sacks of gold coin on their shoulders, containing in some instances as much as they can conveniently lift. At almost every shop-door you will hear, in passing, the "musical ring" of twenty dollar pieces, as they are counted out in adjustment of dues and demands. On one of these steamer days I stepped into the Bank of California, where I saw more gold received and paid out, and standing in cord-piles, than I ever expect to see again. It took an army of clerks to count the money. It was a rich sight worth going across the continent to behold, especially in these days when we have nothing in the East but filthy scrip and greenbacks. This bank has a capital of five millions, and owns gold and silver mines, Government stocks and real estate, valued at five times its original capital. In a word, it controls the financial interests of the Pacific coast.

The various nationalities concentrated in San Francisco, make it an epitome of the civilized world. In fact, every civilized nation is represented here. The Irish predominate and dominate. The Chinese are curiosities. They dress alike, and look alike, and are really a very shrewed people. Not much less than thirty thousand reside in the city. Some of them are merchants on a large scale, worth from thousands to millions of dollars, and are truly very intelligent and accomplished men. The
</p><p>
Chinese population occupy, almost exclusively, several of the business streets, and follow all sorts of trades and employments from cooks to bankers. They all read and write their own language with apparent facility. They have in their tongue an extensive literature, consisting of novels, history and philosophy. They have a religion founded on the teachings of Confucius, and worship in temples.
</p><p>
We stepped into one of their temples, escorted by a Chinaman, and took a view of its interior and the manner of the worshipers. The temple we visited is built of brick, stands retired from the street and in the rear of other buildings, and is reached by a narrow passage between high brick walls. In the second story there is a spacious hall, dusty and dismal as a prison, which is but faintly lighted by a single taper standing on a sort of pulpit or desk, near the end of the hall. Behind this desk, on a shelf-like projection somewhat elevated, sits Joss--the god--before whom the worshipers reverently bow in a kneeling posture, hiding their faces in their hands as in prayer, and whispering a few words, then rise and retire without observing any special order or time, either in going or coming. The hall is decorated with fantastical pictures of man, beast and plant, and other things unlike any thing in nature. The graven image, Joss, sitting on his elevated seat behind the desk, resembles a
little old man; is painted black, and striped with red and yellow, and in outline presents a grotesque appearance. He has a sullen and unrelenting expression of face, and with a curled lip seems to grin and gnash his teeth, as if he intended to devour his delinquent devotees. He is regarded, not as the Good Spirit, but as the Evil Spirit, who inflicts on the Celestials all the ills that befall them in this life. In the hope of averting these ills, they propitiate his forbearance by worship and offerings. On his right hand stands a wooden horse saddled and bridled ready for him to ride; on his left stands a burning taper to light his way. He is supposed to take a ride into the wide world in the night time. In addition to these they furnish him, daily, with nice dishes of cooked food, such as roast pig, baked fowl, and other delicacies, which he is presumed to relish. This supply of food always disappears in the night, and the Celestials believe Joss consumes it. Near the god there is a narrow side-door in the wall which opens into the priest's apartment, and doubtless the crafty priest manages to live on "the fat of the land."
</p><p>
In regard to the Good Spirit, the Celestials believe that all the blessings they enjoy in this life are derived from him, and that he is too good and too kindly disposed in his nature to do them harm. They say he dwells in Heaven, is invisible, and
undefinable, and cannot, therefore, be represented by an image, or elevated or gratified by human worship, but receives the souls of all good Chinamen at death, who live in accordance with the divine instructions of Confucius, and whose dust is commingled, after death, with the sacred soil of the Celestial Empire. Hence every Chinaman desires to be buried in his native land, and, in case he dies in a foreign country, makes provision for the return of his remains, if possible. In San Francisco, there are several organized companies among the Chinese, who receive deposits and apply the money in payment of expenses for re-shipping to China the remains of their countrymen, who die in California. This practice grows out of their religious belief. They are, indeed, a peculiar people. There is much in their character, however, which should command the respect of christendom. They are an honest, industrious, peace-loving people, who have achieved a refined civilization; a civilization which is older, nobler and purer than that of Rome, Greece or Egypt. The "Golden Rule," the very basis of Christianity, was derived from China, and taught in China more than four thousand years before the commencement of the Christian era. Their government is based on moral character and educational acquirement. They revere their rulers, honor age, and commune with the spirits of their
dead. They regard each other as a common brotherhood. They not only excel in the arts, but have inventive genius of a high order. They invented gunpowder and discovered the art of printing long before either was known in Europe. They are imitators by instinct, and can do any thing they see done. Their language is unlike any other known language, ancient or modern. It consists of about three hundred and thirty monosyllables, each of which has four distinct sounds, and each sound conveys a different thought or idea, and is represented in writing by a separate character. The number of characters employed is at least forty thousand. It is, therefore, a difficult language to acquire.
</p><p>
It is true the Chinese love money, and will do any thing, or suffer any hardship, to get it; yet they are trustworthy and skilful in whatever they engage, and strive to give their employers satisfaction. In this they seldom fail. They are generally liked, except by the Irish, who hate and abuse them because they cheapen labor and are preferred. They are very considerate of the prejudices of white men and never intrude, not even to take seats inside street cars, but pay and ride on the outside platform. They are habitually polite, civil and respectful, in whatever position they are placed, whether as servants in families, or as laborers in
the work-shop, in the factory or field. Scattered along the Pacific slope, there are probably not less than seventy or eighty thousand Chinese, with here and there a few Japanese. Of late the Japanese come in colonies, and propose growing silk and tea in this country. They regard the soil and climate of California as well adapted to these products, and doubtless the experiment will prove successful.
</p><p>
In fact, these Asiatics are becoming an important element in American civilization, and not only deserve to be encouraged, but should enjoy equal rights with American citizens. We have a vast unoccupied territory that needs developement; nothing but cheap labor can do it, the more the better. China might spare a hundred millions of her dense population and hardly miss them. This country could receive that number by degrees, and in the course of a half century become the mart and master of the world, if she is not already.
</p><p>
The uniform mild climate of the Pacific coast is really an Asiatic climate, happily adapted to the occupation and developement of the Mongolian race. There is something in the effect of climate that enstamps its impress on the race to which it is adapted. Hence the Mexicans, the Indians, the Pacific islanders, the Japanese, the Chinese, and Hindostanese belong to an Asiatic climate, and are constituted essentially alike in
their color, statue, and other leading characteristics. It is evident from the history of races that the Anglo-Saxon cannot flourish in a warm, equable climate. His nature requires the extremes of heat and cold, as marked by the four seasons in higher latitudes. In a uniform mild climate he will gradually deteriorate, and finally become extinct. People the Pacific coast with Saxons, and allow no accessions or intermixture for a century or two, and I doubt not the law of climate would greatly modify their native characteristics, if it did not extinguish them.
