My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your very welcome & highly interesting letters of the 14th  24th  & 
28 th ult were received with several newspapers & slips cut from others on 
my [way] from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a>, by the hands of Mr Van Allen, 
who was so good as to call at the Barracks where he saw you Mr s Taylor, 
Ann Betty & the girls who had just returned from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a>, all looking 
to be in excellent health 
</p><p>
I was more than gratified on your account to learn that the dreadful 
scourge which had carried off so many persons in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> & vicinity, 
had ceased to be contageous, & I hope as the weather was quite cool when 
Col V. left, that the whole country has been restored to its usual state of 
health 
</p><p>
I was very much pleased to learn that Mrs T. & family had got 
back to the Barracks all well, & without meeting with accident of any kind 
while at the Pass, or in going or returning, & hope the same good fortune 
will attend them until they reach their place of residence. Betty writes 
it had been quite sickly at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> & that Mrs Cross had lost one of 
her daughters but as I observe from one of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> papers there 
had been a frost at that place, I hope they Mr s & Betty as well as Ann & 
the girls can return without running any risk. Should there be the slight 
est danger in Anns remaining at the Barracks, I hope she & the girls will 
go up with Mrs Taylor & Betty to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> & remain with them, until 
they can join you in perfect safety; & should there be a good school at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a>, I hope the girls will remain with their grand mother & be put 
to the same. Betty says they had received a very pressing invitation from 
Mr & Mrs Taylor to make them a visit at Point Coupee & spend some 
time with them before they went to house keeping ; but this I expect 
Mrs Taylor will hardly do, as she must be very anxious to return, particularly as Majr Hooe had taken the liberty of occupying the quarters she 
had been living in, & where was left the whole of her furniture, as I am 
satisfied she will find everything in great confusion, if she finds many 
things at all ; I consider such a procedure on the part of the Majr highly reprehensible 
</p><p>
I left my encampment near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> on the 8th  ins & on the 
evening of the same day met Majr Van Allen with despatches from 
Washington ; which were copies of instructions to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>, to sustain 
his army as far as he could do so, by levying contributions on the enemy, 
& that I was to do the same on this line ; recalling Mr Trist, & directing 
that there should be no more attempts at negotiation ; that if the Mexican government was disposed to negotiate they must make their terms 
known to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> or their wishes, who would communicate the same to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> of the U. States ; but was not to stay in the least his operations against them ; I reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> on the 13th  & left on there on 
the 15th  for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a>, which place I expect to reach this evening or 
to-morrow morning, & where I shall await the result of my application to 
leave the country, which I hope to do by the 2o th or 25th  at farthest; I 
shall not therefore write you again, until I hear from Washington on the 
subject of my leave, & not then if favorable, as I will in that case leave 
Brasos in the first good vessel for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, when we will on my arrival 
discuss many subjects of interest which I will defer until then, particularly 
as regards political matters 
</p><p>
I observe there has been most extraordinary failures in the great commercial houses in England which has had the effect greatly to reduce the 
price of cotton in New Orleans, as well as bread stuffs, & will no doubt 
extend to many other products, & may lead to mercantile embarrassments 
to some extent ; at any rate the country can hardly expect to be as prosperous the coming year, as it was the last, cotton I observe has fallen some 
three cents since the opening of the market, which is a great falling off, 
leaving little or no profit to the grower, particularly to those who like 
myself will only make but half a crop 
</p><p>
I was somewhat surprised that Majr J. could have continued alive 
at the Barracks during the summer, with the yellow fever so near him, I am 
quite surprised he was not carried off from fright. Betty writes me he 
had not called to see her or mother ; his not doing so gives me not the 
slightest concern & I hope he will not attempt to do so, for the time to 
come ; I presume his family has joined ere this even if he could not get 
charge of a Steam Boat to bring them down from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, as I observe 
the Ohio has been in fine order for navigation ; the arrival of the madam 
will add nothing to the society of the Barracks as far as you & yours are concerned ; but I truly hope you, Ann & the girls will give him & his 
family a wide berth, & besides having as little to do with them as possible, never to speak of them, & act as if there was no such people in 
existance 
</p><p>
Majr & Mrs Hunter is with me on their way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a>, where 
the Majr will be stationed 
</p><p>
I sincerely hope Dick will join his mother in the course of the present month if he has not already done so, & if his health is not entirely 
restored, it is in a fair way to become so, at any rate sufficiently so as to 
enable him to commence the study of some profession, or to enter into 
business of some kind ; he has been idle too long for his own good, or 
reputation ; if we can do no better I want him to go to the plantation & 
have a general supervision of the establishment, until he understands the 
operation or principles of planting, when I will set him up in that way 
on his own ace 
</p><p>
Should a leave be refused I will write you immediately on hearing 
Give my love to Ann & the girls if with you, or if absent when you write 
them, as well as to the boys & wishing you & yours continued health & 
prosperity I remain truly & sincerely 
</p><p>
Your Friend
