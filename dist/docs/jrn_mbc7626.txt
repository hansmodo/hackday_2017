Gladden, the hero of the Palmettos in Mexico, is killed. Shiloh has been a dreadful blow to us. Last winter Stephen, 
my brother, had it in his power to do such a nice thing for Colonel Gladden. In the dark he heard his name, also that 
he had to walk twenty-five miles in Alabama mud or go on an ammunition wagon. So he introduced himself as a 
South Carolinian to Colonel Gladden, whom he knew only by reputation as colonel of the Palmetto regiment in the 
Mexican war. And they drove him in his carriage comfort ably to where he wanted to go a night drive of fifty miles 
for Stephen, for he had the return trip, too. I would rather live in Siberia, worse still, in Sahara, than live in a 
country surrendered to Yankees.

" certain and sure," as poor Tom B. said, and then talk of 
rebelling against our home government.

Sat up all night. Read Eothen straight through, our old Wiley and Putnam edition that we bought in London in 
1845. How could I sleep? The power they are bringing to bear against our country is tremendous. Its weight may 
be irresistible I dare not think of that, however.
