SIR, 
</p><p>
I herewith inclose a letter just received from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>, and take this opportunity most heartily to condole with you for the loss of the brave and 
most amiable <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a>, and the other brave officers and soldiers who fell with him, and for 
the failure of success in the unfortunate attack upon Quebec, the particulars of which you will doubtless have received before this reaches you. 
</p><p>
I should have gone down, immediately upon hearing  of the defeat, to the camp before Quebec, but 
the necessity of securing this place and the country 
round in our interest, induced all the officers, and our 
friends here, to request me not to leave this place 
till we should have a reenforcement from the Colonies. When they arrive, I expect to proceed on 
with them. We have many enemies in this province, particularly among the clergy, who are using 
every artifice to excite the Canadians to take up 
arms against us ; but I hope to be able to prevent 
any thing of the kind. I have called in many of 
the commissions given by Governor Carleton, and 
have given out new ones under the Congress, and 
expect soon to have them spread through the country, which I expect, .and indeed I perceive already, 
that it answers very salutary purposes. After receiving new commissions, they look upon themselves 
as bound, and, unless we succeed, they will all be 
treated as traitors. I allow each parish to choose 
their own captains, a circumstance which pleases 
them much, and there have been but few instances 
that they have not chosen a zealous friend to our 
cause. The taking of Quebec must be a matter of 
the greatest consequence to the Colonies, but at 
present we are very ill provided for it. The place 
is strong. I believe they are determined to defend 
it to the last extremity. We have but about four 
tons of powder in the Province. We have, I believe, 
a sufficiency of small cannon, none larger than 
twelve-pounders, except two brass twenty-fours, which are at St. John s. We have expectations of having shot and shells cast at Three Rivers. 
</p><p>
In my opinion it will not only be necessary to 
forward men and powder from the Colonies, but 
also a number of heavy cannon, such as thirty-two 
pounders and one thirteen-inch mortar, if no more, 
and some small ones, if to be had. I understand 
that the large mortar from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, with a number of pieces of cannon, are gone to your camp. It 
is of the greatest importance that whatever is sent 
from the Colonies should be here by the middle of 
March at furthest, for, after that time, the gentle 
men here inform me, it will be impossible to transport any thing from this place to Quebec, on account of the river being filled with ice, and the 
water, of consequence, overflows the flat country. 
Therefore, if any of our wants can be supplied from 
your camp, I could wish that whatever is sent may 
be forwarded as expeditiously as possible. I am, Sir, 
with the greatest esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
