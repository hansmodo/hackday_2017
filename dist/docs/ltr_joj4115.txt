Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter of this date to Mr. Randolph contains an exact 
account of the present state of the affairs of my mission 
here. I shall be disappointed if no good should result. 
As yet, the minister stands entirely uncommitted. From 
some light circumstances, I incline to believe that our mercantile injuries will be redressed ; but how or how far, I 
cannot conjecture. My next conference will doubtless 
place things in more particular and in clearer points of 
view. 
</p><p>
Dr. Gordon has information, winch he relies upon, that 
the posts will not be surrendered, and he authorizes me to 
tell you so in confidence. His information dors not make so 
strong an impression upon my mind as it docs on his; it 
merits attention, but, in my opinion, is not conclusive. 
</p><p>
The observations I have hitherto made induce me to believe that the war with France is popular, and that a war 
with us would be unpopular. The word Jacobin is here a 
term of reproach, and used as such among the common 
people. They who wish the reform of this government, 
do, I apprehend, wish a certain degree of success to the 
present French cause, not because they like it, but because 
they think such success would promote their favourite objects. I often hear gentlemen converse on these subjects, 
but I think it prudent to be reserved ; as to their internal 
parties and divisions, I make it a rule to remain silent. 
</p><p>
Your administration is greatly commended. The idea 
entertained by some, of applying private debts to compensate public injuries, alarms and disgusts, and impairs credit. 
I am anxious to have it in my power to communicate something decisive. As yet, I am entirely satisfied with the 
minister. 
</p><p>
I ought to add, that Mr. Pinckney's conduct relative to 
me corresponds with my ideas of delicacy and propriety. 
</p><p>
With perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
John J a v.

P. S. The enclosed copies of a note of the l!>th inst. 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>, and my answer, afford indications of 
his present temper, that will not escape you. It is always 
useful to communicate such papers, but seldom useful to 
publish them. Publications, unnecessarily and frequently 
made, must naturally increase reserve and circumspection 
to such a degree as, in a great measure, to exclude the advantages of confidence and conversation, and to confine 
negotiation to the slow and, wary mode of written communications, written too under the impression and expectation 
of publication, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
