SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favor of the 12th instant yesterday, 
at this place ; previous to which, about nine o clock 
Saturday morning, the signal at Fort Constitution being  given, and the masters of two sloops, which about 
the same time came to, opposite my house, having 
informed me that the enemy had attacked <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
the evening before, and that they judged, by the report of the cannon, that their shipping had passed by, 
and were up the river as far as King's Bridge, I 
thought it my duty to put the neighbouring militia in motion and accordingly issued orders to three regiments, one immediately to march into these works, 
another into Fort Constitution, and the third to rendezvous at Newburg, on the bank of the river, about 
nine miles above Fort Constitution, with orders to march and reenforce that garrison, upon the next signal given. 
</p><p>
At the same time I issued orders to all the regiments in my brigade, to stand ready to march on a moment's warning, and despatched expresses to all 
owners of sloops and boats twenty miles up the west side of the river, to haul them off so as to prevent their grounding ; that as many of them as were necessary might be ready to carry down the militia to 
the forts. The residue I ordered down to Fort Constitution, as I believe by drawing a chain of them across the narrowest part of the river, and fixing 
them properly to be set on fire, should the enemy's shipping attempt passing by, they would answer a most valuable purpose. Early in the afternoon of 
that day, I marched into Fort Constitution with about 
forty of my neighbours, and in the evening came to 
this fort, being nearer the enemy and better situated 
to discover their motions. Yesterday evening I was 
joined by Colonel Woodhull, with between two and 
three hundred of his regiment; this morning early, 
by Lieutenant-Colonel McClaghry, with upwards of 
five hundred of his ; and I hourly expect parts of 
two other regiments. When these join me, I will 
draft, out of the four, six hundred men, and employ 
them as your Excellency has directed. I have ordered 
the Colonels I have called in, to leave the frontier 
companies at home to protect the country against 
the Indians, should they be troublesome, and as many 
men out of each company as will be sufficient to 
guard against any attempts that might be made by 
internal enemies. 
</p><p>
The men turn out of their harvest fields, to defend 
their country, with surprising alacrity. The absence 
of so many of them, however, at this time, when their 
harvests are perishing for want of the sickle, will 
greatly distress the country. I could wish, therefore, 
a less number might answer the purpose. I would 
fain hope the enemy mean, by their shipping in our 
bays, at present only to cut off the communication 
between the country and city, and prevent our obstructing the channel. Many of the militia may be called in in eight hours ; some in a much less time, 
should there be occasion for them. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, I received a letter from 
Colonel Hay, of Haverstraw, a copy of which is in 
closed. I will send a small party down there this 
evening, or in the morning, but don t believe I shall 
be able to continue them long, as the militia here 
will think hard to be carried there. The bearer, Mr. Boyd, who is well acquainted with this country, the 
fortifications here, and may be confided in, will be 
able to give your Excellency any further information. 
</p><p>
I am, with great esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. I should be glad to know whether it is best to keep the sloops, &c., ordered down to Fort 
Constitution, there, as it may be attended with considerable expense, which, however, if they can be 
made to answer a good purpose, ought not, in my opinion, to be regarded.
