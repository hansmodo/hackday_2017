TO HIS EXCELLENCY <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met">General Washington</a>.
</p><p>
In Council, Oct. 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>.
</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
In mine of the second of the present month, written in the instant of
Colonel Mathews' delivery of your letter, I informed you what had been
done on the subject of Governor Hamilton and his companions previous to
that moment. I now enclose you an advice of Council, in consequence of the letter you were pleased to enclose me, from
the British commissary of prisoners, with one from Lord Rawdon; also
a copy of my letter to Colonel Mathews, enclosing, also, the papers
therein named. The advice of Council to allow the enlargement of
prisoners, on their giving a proper parole, has not been recalled, nor
will be, I suppose, unless something on the part of the enemy should
render it necessary. I rather expect, however, that they will see it
their interest to discontinue this kind of conduct. I am afraid I shall
hereafter, perhaps be obliged to give your Excellency some trouble in
aiding me to obtain information of the future usage of our prisoners. I
shall give immediate orders for having in readiness every engine which
the enemy have contrived for the destruction of our unhappy citizens,
captivated by them. The presentiment of these operations is shocking
beyond expression. I pray Heaven to avert them: but nothing in this
world will do it, but a proper conduct in the enemy. In every event, I
shall resign myself to the hard necessity under which I shall act.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with great regard and esteem,
</p><p>
your Excellency's
</p><p>
most obedient and
</p><p>
most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
