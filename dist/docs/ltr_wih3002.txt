DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have just received the honor of yours of the 14th and 17th instant. 
</p><p>
Yesterday morning, about sunrise, our troops, in 
three divisions, arrived in the neighbourhood of Fort 
Independence ; the right division by the <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> 
Road, the centre by Stephen Ward s, and the left 
by East Chester. Upon our approach, the enemy 
fled to Fort Independence, leaving fifteen muskets at 
one place, and ten at another, besides blankets, &c. 
</p><p>
I summoned the fort to surrender. I have taken 
the liberty to inclose a copy. The answer to the 
summons was verbal, and in substance, that, as the 
Americans were excepted, they, although Britons, had 
no answer to return. They afterwards fired a number of cannon at us from the fort, which we returned. We are just informed, by two deserters from 
the fort, that the garrison consists of about three 
hundred and fifty men ; that the last night they had 
.a twelve-pounder sent to the fort, and that General 
Agnew moved up yesterday with his brigade^ and 
took post at the northernmost woody hill, between 
Fort <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=kings bridge' rel='city'>King's Bridge</a>, and about twelve 
hundred Hessians near the fort. Between two and three hundred Hessians are in the houses just over the bridge. 
</p><p>
We took one light-horseman, with horse complete, 
and one soldier, and have had one man killed by a 
cannon ball this day. To-morrow we intend to make 
an attack upon the Hessians at the bridge, if they 
should not be reenforced. They have two pieces of 
cannon well posted. Our troops are all militia, and, 
although perhaps as good as any militia, yet they 
are not disciplined. Our numbers are about three 
thousand, but they begin to go home already. The 
want of covering, the weather cold, &c., causes many 
complaints. Much will depend on the success of our attack to-morrow. 
</p><p>
I have approved of the sentence of the court-martial on Strang, and have ordered him to be executed on Wednesday next at eleven o clock before noon. 
</p><p>
A Hessian Major, son of one of their Generals, commands Fort Independence. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
