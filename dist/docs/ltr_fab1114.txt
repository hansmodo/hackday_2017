Another moon has come around and brought this time a letter from you. We have a regular mail every day from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> now and I got your letter yesterday and one from Father. I have heard from Sewall since I wrote Father. He and Herod have gone on to Deer Creek and are cutting hay on shares for Lindley. Hay is worth now eight cents per lb and when the emigration from over the plains comes in it will be higher. I have no doubt they will do better than at digging. Herod is perfectly steady and in good health. Sewall's constitution seems to be very much affected by the climate. He wants to sleep about eighteen hours out of the twenty four. Says he 'does not intend to write home for some years.' I refer you to Father's letter for business affairs.

As to amusements, I have but little to tell. Although we have two theatres, negro minstrels, sparring exhibitions by Yankee Sullivan and others, and occasionally a monte bank is bust by way of variety, yet I do not mix up in them.

There are a great many Eastern Captains here now and we have quite a society of down-easters. I think the folks from Maine do not make such good settlers for a new country as the Western Hoosiers. They are all the time grouching, thinking that they cannot make their fortune in a month and as most of them brought lumber here they have got most confoundedly stuck on it and are going to lose money instead of making it.

Our city has improved very much since last month. Two new gambling saloons have been opened. One of them 'See's Exchange' will rival anything in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>. It is one hundred and twenty feet long by forty wide and fifteen high, lighted by splendid chandeliers and the walls hung with fine paintings. It contains an orchestra with a good band, two bars, sixteen monte tables, two roulette, two faro banks and several other games. The Empire is nearly as large and fitted up, if anything, with more magnificence. These saloons are crowded every evening and the music is really good. Over the Exchange is a grand Hall for dancing...the whole size of the building, and is to be dedicated on the fourth of July by a grand ball. There is to be another at the new Hotel at Brighton, five miles out, on the American Fork. I expect the glorious fourth will be celebrated here with all the honors.

I wish when you write to your dear brothers you would write to us separately. Your letter was wet on the passage and somewhat faded and what you wrote about Miss Alice Merrill I can't make out--whether it was my picture and me you want to make a match out of, or Sewalls. However, from what you wrote about her I am half in love with her already. Give her a kiss for me (I wish I was there to do it) and say I am coming home on a visit one of these years and will claim it with interest.
</p><p>
Moreover, when you write again tell me if you get any papers from me. I send them every steamer and our papers out here now have gotten to be quite respectable. We have two dailies in this city.

I am sorry that Mother feels uneasy about my drinking. She has no cause, tell her, to fear of my ever being attached to it. I think too much of my health and good constitution to ruin it by pouring poison down my throat. In this climate especially, a person cannot drink to excess without being sick, besides I have never acquired a love.
for it and I have been in the midst of it every since I left home. In this city everyone drinks, some more and some less. It is considered no disgrace to drink but it is to get drunk. I drink very little and that claret or port wine. I have no taste for it and never shall have. My Mother did just right to bring me up on cold water. I drink it with my meals instead of coffee, yet, and prefer it to anything else. I enjoy first-rate health and although I have had the fever and ague and dysentery in this country, yet I have never employed a doctor. My system yields to the simplest remedies and my appetite on veal cutlets and beef steaks is really awful to behold.
</p><p>
I don't think of anything to say, more, at this time. I expect you to write every month, no matter whether you have anything to say or not. Sit down and think of something. Your letters are always interesting and your excuses about not being a good letter-writer are getting stale.
