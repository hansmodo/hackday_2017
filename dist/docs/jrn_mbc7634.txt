<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='12'>12th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. Mr. Chesnut says he is very glad he went to 
town. Everything in Charleston is so much more satisfactory than it is reported. Troops are in good spirits. It will

Isaac Hayne said at dinner yesterday that both <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> and the President had a great opinion of Mr. Chesnut's natural ability for strategy and military evolution. 
Hon. Mr. Barnwell concurred; that is, Mr. Barnwell had 
been told so by the President. Then why did not the President offer me something better than an aideship? " "I 
heard he offered to make you a general last year, and you said you could not go over other men's shoulders until you 
had earned promotion. You are too hard to please. " ll No, 
not exactly that, I was only offered a colonelcy, and Mr. Barnwell persuaded me to stick to the Senate; then he wanted my place, and between the two stools I fell to the ground.

My Molly will forget Lige and her babies, too. I asked 
her who sent me that beautiful bouquet I found on my center-table. "I give it to you. Twas give to me." And Molly 
was all wriggle, giggle, blush.
