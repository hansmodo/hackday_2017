My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
By this day's courier, you will be informed of a base insult offer'd to the Commander in chief, which will raise your indignation. 
</p><p>
A preliminary anecdote may throw some light upon 
this matter. Some time ago, his Exc y received a letter 
from a friend, enclosing a piece of paper with the following words : " In a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>Gen'l Gates</a>, Gen'l Conway says, Heaven has been determined to save your 
country, or a weak general and bad counsellors would 
have ruined it. The Gen'l immediately copied the 
contents of the paper, introducing them with sir, and 
concluding with, I am your humble serv 4 , and sent 
this copy in form of a letter to Gen'l Conway." This 
drew an answer, in which he first attempts to deny the 
fact, and then in a most shameless manner, to explain 
away the word weakness. The perplexity of his style, 
and evident insincerity of his compliments, betray his 
real sentiments, and expose his guilt. 
</p><p>
After this, he certainly had no right to expect cordiality on the part of the general, but he has always 
been treated with that kind of civility, which resulted 
from a consideration of his public character, abstracted 
from his private one. He experienced that kind of complaisance, which passes current in the transactions of 
men, and in which the heart is not concerned. Indeed 
you will think, perhaps, the General's delicacy on this 
point led him to too great forbearance when you learn 
that Gen'l Conway was charged with cowardice at the 
battle of German Town, and that a gentleman of rank 
and reputation, desir'd to be called upon as an evidence. It is notorious that he disobey'd his orders, 
and that he was fora considerable time separated from 
his brigade. The Gen'l , however, thinking that a pub 
lic investigation of this matter set on foot by him, 
might be attribut'd to motives of personal resentment, 
suffer'd it to pass over. When Gen'l C. left camp, pre 
tending that he was determined to return to France, 
his countrymen discerned his real intentions, and gave 
him credit for the manoeuvre. 
</p><p>
He has weight it seems with a certain party, formed 
against the present Commander in chief, at the head 
of which is Gen'l Minim. His own preposterous panegyricks of himself, and the influence of this junto, have 
probably gained him the extraordinary promotion, 
which has convulsed the army. His reception at camp 
was consonant to the Gem" 8 uniform conduct towards 
him, since the epoch above alluded to ; the complaisance due to his rank was exercised towards him. 
</p><p>
What has passed since, you will be properly informed 
of. His last letter, which is a most insolent attempt 
at what the French call persiflage, or humouring a man, 
affects the Gen'l very sensibly. 
</p><p>
It is such an affront as Conway would never have dared to offer, if the General's situation had not assured him of the impossibility of its being revenged in a 
private way. The Gen'l , therefore, has determined to return him no answer at all, but to lay the whole matter before Congress ; they will determine whether Gen'l W. is to be sacrificed to Gen'l C., for the former can never consent to be concerned in any transaction with 
the latter, from whom he has received such uupadonable insults. My private opinion is, that Conway 
never meant to act as Inspector Gen'l , or to carry his new grade of major general into the field ; but that his vanity being amply gratified by his exaltation, not only 
above the brigadiers, but even the major generals, he was desirous of retiring to a more lucrative and less dangerous employment in the service of the states at 
home. I hope that some virtuous and patriotic men, will form a countermine to blow up the pernicious junto spoken of above. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty of writing to you my dear father on this subject, in order that you might be more minutely acquainted with it. 
</p><p>
I have been obliged to do it in a hurry, and in a small, noisy, crowded room. I have succeeded so far with secrecy, and dare not venture upon a more decent 
copy. I hope, therefore, that you will excuse my letter, and accept it in its present dress. 
</p><p>
I hope it will find you perfectly reliev'd from your old enemy, the gout, and in condition to save America from her most dangerous enemies. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
I hope Congress will not lose sight of the office of inspector Gen'l .
