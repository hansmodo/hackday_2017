<br> My Dear Boy, <br>
Another week and still no letter from you, I hope with all my heart you are safe 
and well again. We are so excited over the end of the war with the hope that most 
of you may be allowed to return. We have had a severe siege with the (unintelligible) 
Influenza but thanks be it is all over now. Am going to send a war box to you 
and shall go and make arrangements today. Have had the pigs butchered. One weighed 
193 lbs which he sold to Mr. Jones for $28.50 and one half the smaller one to 
Mr. Coater for $15.50 and have the other half packed with a good load of salt 
over it. This is the latest home news, The taxes are paid for the year passed 
and the interest money ready for the last payment so you need not worry about 
anything. Had a letter from Mrs. Boyer saying she expects to visit (unintelligible) 
soon and if she likes will mak her home here. Your last letter took one month 
to get. It must be weary waiting for you and it certainly is for us. <br>
<br>
From your loving mother Sara King
