MY DEAR MRS. STOWE : 
</p><p>
You kindly informed me, when at your house a fortnight ago, that you designed to do something which should permanently contribute 
to the improvement and elevation of the free colored people in the United States. You especially expressed an interest in such of this 
class as had become free by their own exertions, and desired most of all to be of service to them. In what manner and by what means 
you can assist this class most successfully, is the subject upon which you have done me the honor to ask my opinion. ... I assert, then, 
that poverty, ignorance, and degradation are the combined evils; or in other words, these constitute the social disease of the free colored 
people of the United States. 
</p><p>
To deliver them from this triple malady is to improve and elevate them, by which I mean simply to put them on an equal footing with 
their white fellow-countrymen in the sacred right to "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." I am for no fancied or artificial 
elevation, but only ask fair play. How shall this be obtained? I answer, first, not by establishing for our use high schools and colleges. Such institutions are, in my judgment, beyond our immediate 
occasions and are not adapted to our present most pressing wants. High schools and colleges are excellent institutions, and will in due 
season be greatly subservient to our progress ; but they are the result, as well as they are the demand, of a point of progress which we as a 
people have not yet attained. Accustomed as we have been to the rougher and harder modes of living, and of gaining a livelihood, we 
cannot and we ought not to hope that in a single leap from our low condition, we can reach that of Ministers, Lawyers, Doctors, Editors, 
Merchants, etc. These will doubtless- be attained by us ; but this will only be when we have patiently and laboriously, and I may add successfully, mastered and passed through the intermediate gradations 
of agriculture and the mechanic arts. Besides, there are (and perhaps this is a better reason for my view of the case) numerous institutions 
of learning in this country, already thrown open to colored youth. To my thinking, there are quite as many facilities now afforded to 
the colored people as they can spare the time, from the sterner duties of life, to avail themselves of. In their present condition of poverty, 
they cannot spare their sons and daughters two or three years at boarding-schools or colleges, to say nothing of finding the means to 
sustain them while at such institutions. I take it, therefore, that we are well provided for in this respect; and that it may be fairly 
inferred from the fact, that the facilities for our education, so far as schools and colleges in the Free States are concerned, will increase 
quite in proportion with our future wants. Colleges have been open to colored youth in this country during the last dozen years. Yet 
few, comparatively, have acquired a classical education; and even this few have found themselves educated far above a living condition, 
there being no methods by -v. _ich they could turn their learning to account. Several of this latter class have entered the ministry ; but 
you need not be told that an educated people is needed to sustain an educated ministry. There must be a certain amount of cultivation 
among the people, to sustain such a ministry. At present we have not that cultivation amongst us; and, therefore, we value in the 
preacher strong lungs rather than high learning. I do not say that educated ministers are not needed amongst us, far from it! I wish 
there were more of them! but to increase their number is not the largest benefit you can bestow upon us. 
</p><p>
We have two or three colored lawyers in this country ; and I rejoice in the fact; for it affords very gratifying evidence of our progress. 
Yet it must be confessed that, in point of success, our lawyers are as great failures as our ministers. White people will not employ them 
to the obvious embarrassment of their causes, and the blacks, taking their cue from the whites, have not sufficient confidence in their 
abilities to employ them. Hence educated colored men, among the colored people, are at a very great discount. It would seem that 
education and emigration go together with us, for as soon as a man rises amongst us, capable, by his genius and learning, to do us great service, just so soon he finds that he can serve himself better by going 
elsewhere. In proof of this, I might instance the Russwurms, the Garnetts, the Wards, the Crummells, and others, all men of superior 
ability and attainments, and capable of removing mountains of prejudice against their race, by their simple presence in the country; but 
these gentlemen, finding themselves embarrassed here by the peculiar disadvantages to which I have referred, disadvantages in part grow 
ing out of their education, being repelled by ignorance on the one hand, and prejudice on the other, and having no taste to continue a 
contest against such odds, they have sought more congenial climes, where they can live more peaceable and quiet lives. I regret their 
election, but I cannot blame them; for with an equal amount of education, and the hard lot which was theirs, I might follow their example. . . . 
</p><p>
There is little reason to hope that any considerable number of the free colored people will ever be induced to leave this country, even if 
such a thing were desirable. The black man (unlike the Indian) loves civilization. He does not make very great progress in civilization 
himself, but he likes to be in the midst of it, and prefers to share its most galling evils, to encountering barbarism. Then the love of 
country, the dread of isolation, the lack of adventurous spirit, and the thought of seeming to desert their "brethren in bonds," are a 
powerful check upon all schemes of colonization, which look to the removal of the colored people, without the slaves. The truth is, dear 
madam, we are here, and here we are likely to remain. Individuals emigrate nations never. We have grown up with this republic, and I see nothing in her character, or even in the character of the Ameri 
can people, as yet, which compels the belief that we must leave the United States. If, then, we are to remain here, the question for the 
wise and good is precisely that you have submitted to me namely: What can be done to improve the condition of the free people of color 
in the United States? The plan which I humbly submit in answer to this inquiry (and in the hope that it may find favor with you, and 
with the many friends of humanity who honor, love, and cooperate with you) is the establishment in Rochester, N. Y., or in some other 
part of the United States equally favorable to such an enterprise, of an INDUSTRIAL COLLEGE in which shall be taught several important 
branches of the mechanic arts. This college to be open to colored youth. I will pass over the details of such an institution as I propose. . . . Never having had a day's schooling in all my life, I may 
not be expected to map out the details of a plan so comprehensive as that involved in the idea of a college. I repeat, then, I leave the 
organization and administration to the superior wisdom of yourself and the friends who second your noble efforts. The argument in 
favor of an Industrial College (a college to be conducted by the best men, and the best workmen which the mechanic arts can afford ; a 
college where colored youth can be instructed to use their hands, as well as their heads ; where they can be put in possession of the means 
of getting a living whether their lot in after life may be cast among civilized or uncivilized men; whether they choose to stay here, or 
prefer to return to the land of their fathers) is briefly this : Prejudice against the free colored people in the United States has shown itself 
nowhere so invincible as among mechanics. The farmer and the professional man cherish no feeling so bitter as that cherished by 
these. The latter would starve us out of the country entirely. At this moment I can more easily get my son into a lawyer's office to 
study law than I can into a blacksmith's shop to blow the bellows and to wield the sledge-hammer. Denied the means of learning useful 
tradrs, we are pressed into the narrowest limits to obtain a livelihood. 
</p><p>
In times past we have been the hewers of wood and drawers of water for American society, and we once enjoyed a monopoly in menial 
employments, but this is so no longer. Even these employments are rapidly passing away out of our hands. The fact is (every day begins 
with the lesson, and ends with the lesson) that colored men must learn trades ; must find new employments ; new modes of usefulness 
to society, or that they must decay under the pressing wants to which their condition is rapidly bringing them. 
</p><p>
We must become mechanics; we must build as well as live hi houses ; we must make as well as use furniture ; we must construct 
bridges as well as pass over them, before we can properly live or be respected by our fellow men. We need mechanics as well as ministers. We need workers in iron, clay, and leather. We have orators, 
authors, and other professional men, but these reach only a certain class, and get respect for our race in certain select circles. To live 
here as we ought we must fasten ourselves to our countrymen through their every -day, cardinal wants. We must not only be able to Hack 
boots, but to make them. At present we are unknown in the northern States as mechanics. We give no proof of genius or skill at the 
county, State, or national fairs. We are unknown at any of the great exhibitions of the industry of our fellow-citizens, and being unknown, we are unconsidered. 
</p><p>
The fact that we make no show of our ability is held conclusive of our inability to make any, hence all the indifference and contempt 
with which incapacity is regarded fall upon us, and that too when we have had no means of disproving the infamous opinion of our 
natural inferiority. I have, during the last dozen years, denied before the Americans that we are an inferior race ; but this has been 
done by arguments based upon admitted principles rather than by the presentation of facts. Now, firmly believing, as I do, that there are 
skill, invention, power, industry, and real mechanical genius among the colored people, which will bear favorable testimony for them, 
and which only need the means to develop them, I am decidedly in favor of the establishment of such a college as I have mentioned. 
The benefits of such an institution would not be confined to the Northern States, nor to the free colored people. They would extend 
over the whole Union. The slave not less than the freeman would be benefited by such an institution. It must be confessed that the most 
powerful argument now used by the southern slaveholder, and the one most soothing to his conscience, is that derived from the low 
condition of the free colored people of the North. I have long felt that too little attention has been given by our truest friends in this 
country to removing this stumbling-block out of the way of the slave's liberation. 
</p><p>
The most telling, the most killing refutation of slavery is the pre sentation of an industrious, enterprising, thrifty, and intelligent free 
black population. Such a population I believe would rise in the Northern States under the fostering care of such a college as that supposed. 
</p><p>
To show that we are capable of becoming mechanics I might adduce any amount of testimony ; but, dear madam, I need not ring the 
changes on such a proposition. There is no question in the mind of any unprejudiced person that the Negro is capable of making a good 
mechanic. Indeed, even those who cherish the bitterest feelings toward us have admitted that the apprehension that negroes might be 
employed in their stead dictated the policy of excluding them from trades altogether. But I will not dwell upon this point, as I fear I 
have already trespassed too long upon your precious time, and written more than I ought to expect you to read. Allow me to say in conclusion that I believe every intelligent colored man in America will 
approve and rejoice at the establishment.of some such institution as that now suggested. There are many respectable colored men, fathers 
of large families, having boys nearly grown up, whose minds are tossed by day and by night with the anxious inquiry, What shall I do 
with my boys? Such an institution would meet the wants of such persons. Then, too, the establishment of such an institution would 
be in character with the eminently practical philanthropy of your transatlantic friends. America could scarcely object to it as an attempt to agitate the public mind on the subject of slavery, or to 
dissolve the Union. It could not be tortured into a cause for hard words by the American people, but the noble and good of all classes 
would see in the effort an excellent motive, a benevolent object, temperately, wisely, and practically manifested. 
</p><p>
Wishing you, dear madam, renewed health, a pleasant passage, and safe return to your native land, 
</p><p>
I am, most truly, your grateful friend,
