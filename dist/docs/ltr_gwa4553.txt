Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The communications in your several letters, relative to the 
state of affairs in Europe, are very gratefully received ; and I 
should be glad if it were in my power to reply to them more in 
detail than I am able to do. But my public duties, which are 
at all times sufficiently numerous, being now much accumulated 
by an absence of more than three month? from the seat of government, make the present a very busy moment for me. 
</p><p>
The change of systems, which have so long prevailed in Eu 
rope, will, undoubtedly, affect us in a degree proportioned to 
our political or commercial connexions with the several nations of it. But I trust we shall never so far lose sight of our 
own interest and happiness as to become, unnecessarily, a party in their political disputes. Our local situation enables us to 
maintain that state, with respect to them, which otherwise could 
not, perhaps, be preserved by human wisdom. The present 
moment seems pregnant with great events ; but, as you observe, it is beyond the ken of mortal foresight to determine 
what will be the result of those changes, which are either making, or contemplated, in the general system of Europe. Al 
though as fellow men we sincerely lament the disorders, oppressions, and incertitude, which frequently attend national 
events, and which our European brethren must feel, yet we 
cannot but hope, that it will terminate very much in favor of 
the rights of man. And that a change there, will be favorable to this country, I have no doubt. For under the former 
system we were seen either in the distresses of war, or viewed 
after the peace in a most unfavorable light through the medium of our distracted state. In neither point could we appear 
of much consequence among nations. And should affairs continue in Europe in the same state they were, when these impressions respecting us were received, it would not be an easy matter to remove the prejudices imbibed against us. A 
change of system will open a new view of things, and we shall 
then burst upon them, as it were, with redoubled advantages. 
</p><p>
Should we, under the present state of affairs, form connexions, other than we now have, with any European powers, 
much must be considered in effecting them, on the score of our 
increasing importance as a nation ; and at the same time, should 
a treaty be formed with a nation, whose circumstances may not 
at this moment be very bright, much delicacy would be necessary in order to show that no undue advantages were taken on 
that account. For unless treaties are mutually beneficial to 
the parties, it is vain to hope for a continuance of them beyond 
the moment when the one, which conceives itself overreached, 
is in a situation to break off the connexion. And I believe it 
is among nations as with individuals, that the party taking ad 
vantage of the distresses of another will lose infinitely more in 
the opinion of mankind, and in subsequent events, than it will 
gain by the stroke of the moment.

In my late tour through the southern States, I experienced 
great satisfaction in seeing the good effects of the general government in that part of the union. The people at large have 
felt the security which it gives, and the equal justice which it 
administers to them. The farmer, the merchant, and the 
mechanic have seen their several interests attended to, and 
from thence they unite in placing a confidence in their representatives, as well as in those in whose hands the execution of 
the laws is placed. Industry has there taken place of idleness, and economy of dissipation. Two or three years of 
good crops, and a ready market for the produce of their lands, 
have put every one in good humor ; and in some instances they 
even impute to the government what is due only to the goodness of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. 
</p><p>
The establishment of public credit is an immense point 
gained in our national concerns. This, I believe, exceeds the 
expectation of the most sanguine among us. And a late in 
stance, unparalleled in this country, has been given of the confidence reposed in our measures, by the rapidity with which 
the subscriptions to the Bank of the United States were filled. 
In two hours after the books were opened by the commissioners, the whole number of shares was taken up, and four thou 
sand more applied for, than were allowed by the institution ; 
besides a number of subscriptions which were coming on. 
This circumstance was not only pleasing, as it related to the 
confidence in government, but as it exhibited an unexpected 
proof of the resources of our citizens. 
</p><p>
In one of my letters to you the account of the number of 
inhabitants, which would probably be found in the United 
States on enumeration, was too large. The estimate was 
then founded on the ideas held out by the gentlemen in Congress of the population of the several States, each of whom (as 
was very natural) looking through a magnifier would speak of 
the greatest extent, to which there was any probability of their 
numbers reaching. Returns of the census have already been 
made from several of the States, and a tolerably just estimate 
has been now formed in others ; by which it appears, that we 
shall hardly reach four millions ; but this you are to take along 
with it, that the real number will greatly exceed the official 
return^ because, from religious scruples, some would not give 
in their lists ; from an apprehension that it was intended as 
the foundation of a tax, others concealed, or diminished theirs ; 
and from the indolence of the mass, and want of activity in 
many of the deputy enumerators, numbers are omitted. The 
authenticated number will, however, be far greater, I believe, 
than has ever been allowed in Europe ; and will have no 
small influence in enabling them to form a more just opinion 
of our present growing importance, than has yet been entertained there.

This letter goes with one from the Secretary of State, to 
which I must refer you for what respects your public transactions, and I shall only add to it the repeated assurances of 
regard and affection, with which I am, dear Sir, 
Your obedient and obliged,
