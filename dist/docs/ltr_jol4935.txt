My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
This will be delivered to you by Brigadier General Du Portail, commanding officer of Engineers, whom 
I am glad of having an opportunity of introducing to 
your acquaintance. His knowledge of his profession 
renders him respectable, and by aiding his want of 
fluency in the English, with your French, you will 
find his conversation agreeable and worth attending to. 
</p><p>
I do not know whether what I am going to solicit 
can be effected, nor would I ask it if it were anything 
contrary to rule, or that could be productive of the 
most remote ill consequences. Mr. De Murnant, a 
French gentleman, offered himself as assistant engineer, under strong recommendations from Gen'l Du Portail. His excellency submitted the matter to the 
committee in camp, and it is very probable that in 
the order of business it might not present itself till 
very late for the ratification of Congress. In the 
mean time, the poor man is kept in a state of suspense, and what is equally bad, of expence. If the 
question relative to him could be brought 011 the 
carpet immediately, as it cannot be a subject of long 
debate or occasion any interruption to business, 
Gen'l Du Portail and himself wish that it maybe done. 
He is at present employed in works of the camp. 
</p><p>
I must not defer thanking you for your kind letter 
of the 15th inst. Tho I am unable to give such 
answer to it as you wish, I still hope that the arguments which you use on the subject of your retiring 
from Congress, will be seen in another light. 
</p><p>
Du Plessis told me that he had commissioned a Mr. De la Balme to put some books into your hands for 
me. My dearest friend and father, adieu. 
</p><p>
Ever your affectionate 
</p><p>
