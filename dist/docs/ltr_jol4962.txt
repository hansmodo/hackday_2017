My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Permit me to introduce to your acquaintance the 
Baron D Arendt, Col. of the German batallion, who 
in consequence of disputes with his corps of officers, 
which he thinks make it inconvenient with his honour 
to serve with them again, and from the improbability 
of his being placed elsewhere in an agreeable military 
station, has determined to resign his commission, and 
goes to Congress to obtain their leave. I have received both entertainment and improvement in con 
versing with him as a military man, and will be 
obliged to you to shew him such civilities as your 
leisure and your public business will allow. 
</p><p>
I am, with the most tender attachment and respect, 
</p><p>
Your dutiful son 
</p><p>
