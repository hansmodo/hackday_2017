My Dear Brother: Your movements have been so 
rapid of late that I scarcely knew where to address 
you. I have recently met with several officers who 
have been with you, among others <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> and 
General Butterfield. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> is all the rage; he 
is subjected to the disgusting but dangerous process 
of being lionized. He is followed by crowds and is 
cheered everywhere. While he must despise the fickle 
fools who run after him, he, like most others, may be 
spoiled by this excess of flattery. He may be so elated 
as to forget the uncertain tenure upon which he holds 
and stakes his really well-earned laurels. I conversed 
with him but little, as I did not wish either to occupy 
his time or to be considered his flatterer. The opinion 
I form of him from his appearance is this, his will and 
common-sense are the strongest features of his character. 
He is plain and modest, and so far bears himself well. 
All here give him hearty co-operation, but an officer who 
does not like <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> tells me that Halleck -will ruin 
Grant with the President in sixty days, or on failure 
to do so will resign. . . . 
</p><p>
We all here are disposed to take a hopeful view of 
the stattts in quo. The enormous Government bounties have been effective, but they are terribly severe on 
our finances. We can't forever endure such expenditures. Warning and caution to this danger are unheeded. 
Our people are so hopeful and energetic that they will 
bear more than any other. . . . 
</p><p>
You are now in a position where any act of yours will 
command public attention. You will be unduly lauded 
and sharply abused. I hope you have seen enough of 
the base motives that dictate praise and blame to disregard both, but preserve the best of your judgment in 
utter disregard of flattery or clamor. 
</p><p>
When any of your friends come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, give 
them notes to me. I may be of service to/them. At all 
events I like to see them. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
