My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although our correspondence has been long interrupted, I hope that our friendship never will, notwithstanding the arts of wicked men, who have endeavoured to create discord and dissension among; the 
friends of America. For myself, having little but my 
good wishes to send you, it was not worth while to 
take up your attention a moment with them. The 
contents of this letter will, I am sure, require no 
apology, because you always approve that zeal which 
is employed in the public service, and has for its object the public good. 
</p><p>
The present state of our country. Sir, is such as 
to demand the most immediate and most effectual interposition to prevent the numerous resources of Virginia from becoming means, in the hands of our enemies, for subduing the liberties of North America. 
For, though the efforts of this State have been not quite so strong as its abilities warranted, yet when it 
shall be placed under the sword of a conqueror, such 
resources will be found, and such powers drawn from 
it, as will put the liberties of North America in imminent peril. My following opinion is not founded 
upon vain apprehensions, but upon good materials and 
attentive observation. 
</p><p>
Virginia, it is true, has nine times the number of 
men that now threaten its ruin; but they are dispersed, unarmed, without system, government, and 
very little probability at present of the Legislature 
assembling. The enemy's army is in the heart of the 
country, employing, with exquisite industry'-, every engine that force and fraud can move, to effect a conquest of the whole, or far greater part, immediately. 
I think. Sir, that they will succeed, if adequate prevention be not presently applied. When the enemy's 
army began to move, after the junction of their troops, 
in force much superior to the Marquis, the Assembly 
adjourned to Charlotteville, where they were never 
able to collect members sufficient to form the Legislature, before they were dispersed by five hundred of 
the enemy's light-horse, with as many light infantry 
mounted behind, as we learn from some of the flying 
Delegates. The Governor had resigned his office, but 
no successor had been appointed; and Mr. Digges, 
the Lieutenant-Governor, it seems has been made a 
prisoner, and released upon parole ; whilst there is, 
in the present state of things, little chance for a 
meeting of the Assembly to apply the feeble remedy 
which their choice of a Governor would amount to. 
Thus we remain without Government, at a time when the most wise and most vigorous administration 
of public affairs can alone save us from the ruin determined for us by the enemy. I have taken the 
liberty of communicating my thoughts on this subject 
to Mr. Lovell, in a letter, a copy of which I have 
now the honor to inclose to you, together with a letter from your brother, who agrees perfectly with me 
in sentiment ; and, I verily believe, there is not a good 
citizen, or friend to the liberty of America, in the 
State, who does not wish that the plan proposed may 
immediately be adopted. I have written in the same 
manner to Colonel Bland and Mr. Jones, our Delegates 
in Congress. 
</p><p>
It would be a thing for angels to weep over, if 
the goodly fabric of human freedom, which you have 
so well labored to rear, should, in one unlucky moment, be levelled with the dust. There is nothing I 
think more certain than that your personal call would 
bring into immediate exertion the force and the resources of this State, and its neighbouring ones, 
which, directed as they would be, will effectually disappoint and baffle the deep-laid schemes of the enemy. By seizing the fine horses on James River, 
they have mounted a gallant and most mischievous 
cavalry of five or six hundred in number. We have 
plenty of horses left, to be sure, but we are deficient 
in proper accoutrements ; though I understand that 
the Marquis is endeavouring to mount a thousand 
men as quickly as possible, to control the boundless 
ravage of the enemy's horse. Some of the dispersed 
Delegates report it as extremely probable that our 
collected stores in the north fork of James River 
have fallen into the enemy's hands, as their cavalry 
were a little above, and the main body of their army not far below, directing its course to the north fork, 
which was guarded only by seven or eight hundred 
new levies under <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a>. 
</p><p>
Our country is truly, Sir, in a deplorable way, 
and, if relief comes not from you, it will probably 
come not at all. I have heard it reported in this 
country, that <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a> dislikes being commanded by the Marquis. If this should be unhappily true, 
the consequences will be obvious to you. I have the 
honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem, dear Sir, your most affectionate friend. 
</p><p>
And most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
