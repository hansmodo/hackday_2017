DEAR SIR ; 
</p><p>
I should have troubled you with a few lines if any 
thing had occurred to me that might, in the least, 
tend to promote the service. You receive such a multitude of letters, that I can hardly think myself excused in taking up so much of your time as to thank 
you for the civilities I received from you at camp. 
</p><p>
I shall be happy to hear that you have passed the 
winter undisturbed; and that you have been able to 
keep your army together. My fears about provisions 
and forage, I confess, still give me great pain. 
</p><p>
Recruiting in this and the next county below succeeds better than I expected. One half of the quota 
required of each county is, I am well informed, made up, and the remainder will soon be completed. The 
farmers are in great fear of a law to draft the militia; and they are exerting themselves to the utmost 
in assisting the recruiting officers. 
</p><p>
There is no person who more sincerely wishes success to the cause of America than I do ; and I should 
have esteemed it an honor to have been continued in 
the command I had in Pennsylvania, if the Government had been such a one as promised that freedom 
and happiness for which we are contending with 
Great Britain. I now no longer look upon myself asa resident of that State, and am at a loss to know 
what part I shall act in this. As soon as the campaign opens, I shall endeavour to make myself useful 
in some way or other. 
</p><p>
The importance of Billingsport to us, if we should 
be able to act offensively, has not, I dare say, escaped 
your notice. But I am apprehensive the enemy know too well its consequence to neglect to take possession 
of it before we dare to do it. Five or six hundred 
men might defend it against a storm ; but would it 
be possible to keep it till we could collect force 
enough to make an attempt by siege dangerous to

quire such a variety of movements, that it appears to 
me a very considerable number of boats will be necessary. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my compliments to Mrs. 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. With the sincerest esteem and respect, 
I remain, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
