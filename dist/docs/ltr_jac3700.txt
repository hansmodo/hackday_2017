Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your Excellency's favors 
of the 28th ultimo, and 5th and 10th instant. I am at Schoharie, whose place I have supplied by a company of levies. Hazen's regiment I have ordered 
to Caghnawaga, about twenty-five miles above Schenectady, on the Mohawk River, leaving one company 
at Schenectady, for the purpose of forwarding stores 
up the river. Colonel Willett, with such of the levies 
as are not otherwise disposed of, will be stationed at 
the Rapid and Fort Plane, about half way between 
Caghnawaga and the German Flats. I flatter myself 
this disposition will meet your Excellency's approbation, especially when you consider the very extensive 
line of communication which is to be supported, and 
the very many avenues through which we are exposed to attacks from the enemy in small parties. 
</p><p>
From a variety of accounts, received through different channels, I am informed the enemy's force at 
Crown Point is near two thousand, though I cannot 
persuade myself that they are near so strong. A 
party of our Indians, I hear, have returned, and 
brought in two prisoners, who have not yet arrived 
in town, by whom I may possibly obtain some intelligence which may be depended on, and which, when 
received, shall be transmitted to head-quarters. From 
the complexion of Hazen's regiment, and their disposition to mutiny, I could have wished they had not 
been sent up. They have been necessarily detained 
a few days in this city; and the numerous disaffected 
tribes, which swarm here, have so far inflamed their 
minds that they are already become almost ungovernable. They have declared they will not march without money. Two of the principals, who had been 
confined, were forcibly released by their fellows last 
night, and the most disorderly conduct ensued. We 
have, however, apprehended them this morning, and 
a Court-Martial is now sitting to determine their fate. With respect to provisions, I hope we shall be able 
to procure the necessary supplies of flour, but beef 
we are entirely destitute of I have directed Mr. 
Gamble to proceed to the eastward, and forward on, 
without loss of time, such quantities as he may be 
able to procure, either from Mr. Phelps, or Springfield, 
or both, agreeably to your Excellency's instruction. 
I have been so particularly attentive to the issues of 
provisions in this quarter, that shortly after my arrival here I ordered no returns to be answered unless 
countersigned by me, which I find has been productive of the best consequences. I could wish some 
direct line of conduct was pointed out, specifying 
who are the proper objects of public bounty, and 
who not; for, though the wives and children of the 
soldiers, as well as the Canada refugees, swell the 
provision returns to a very considerable amount, yet 
when we consider that the former cannot receive the 
reward either of their own or their husbands' labor, 
and the sacrifice which many of the latter have made 
by their voluntary exile, it appears an act of cruelty 
to deny them a scanty pittance. 
</p><p>
For the protection of the surviving part of this 
devoted State, I could wish the troops now here 
could be permitted to remain until absolute and immediate necessity calls for their services with the 
army. Their stations are compact, and in seven days 
of favorable weather they could be landed at West 
Point. There are now in the ground the most promising crops, and the face of the country affords a 
most flattering prospect. Prudence and policy, as 
well as dear-bought experience, evidently dictate the 
necessity of endeavouring to preserve it. I must 
here beg leave to plead your Excellency's promise, 
and request that, when offensive operations commence against the enemy, I may not be forgotten among 
those who are ambitious of devoting themselves and 
their services to the good of their country. I have 
the honor to be, 
</p><p>
With the greatest respect, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. June ISt/i. This day Hazen's regiment marched in good order for their station. The prisoners 
alluded to have arrived, the examination of whom I 
have the honor to inclose.
