<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='30'>30th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. The last day of this month of calamities. Lovell left the women and children to be shelled, and took 
the army to a safe place. I do not understand why we do 
not send the women and children to the safe place and let 
the army stay where the fighting is to be. Armies are to 
save, not to be saved. At least, to be saved is not their 
raison d etre exactly. If this goes on the spirit of our people will be broken. One ray of comfort comes from Henry 
Marshall. Our Army of the Peninsula is fine ; so good I do not think <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan</a> will venture to attack it. So mote it be.
