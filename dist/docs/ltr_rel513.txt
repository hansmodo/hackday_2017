her.  I don't now remember why, but it was decided that I should return

I received, dear Mary, your letter of the 5th by Beverly Turner [A
son of Mr. Edward Turner, of 'Kinloch'], who is a nice young soldier.
I am pained to see find young men like him, of education and standing,
from all the old and respectable families in the State, serving in
the ranks.  I hope in time they will receive their reward.  I met him
as I was returning from an expedition to the enemy's works, which I
had hoped to have surprised on the morning of the 12th, both at Cheat
Mountain and on Valley River.  All the attacking parties with great
labour had reached their destination, over mountains considered
impassable to bodies of troops, notwithstanding a heavy storm that
set in the day before and raged all night, in which they had to stand
up till daylight.  Their arms were then unserviceable, and they in
poor condition for a fierce assault against artillery and superior
numbers.  After waiting till 10 o'clock for the assault on Cheat
Mountain, which did not take place, and which was to have been the
signal for the rest, they were withdrawn, and, after waiting three
days in front of the enemy, hoping he would come out of his trenches,
we returned to our position at this place.  I can not tell you my
regret and mortification at the untoward events that caused the failure
of the plan.  I had taken every precaution to ensure success and counted
on it.  but the Ruler of the Universe willed otherwise and sent a storm
to disconcert a well-laid plan, and to destroy my hopes.  We are no
worse off now than before, except the disclosure of our plan, against
which they will guard.  We met with one heavy loss which grieves me
deeply:  Colonel Washington accompanied Fitzhugh on a reconnoitering
expedition, and I fear they were carried away by their zeal and
approached the enemy's pickets.  The first they knew was a volley from
a concealed party within a few yards of them.  Their balls passed
through the Colonel's body, then struck Fitzhugh's horse, and the
horse of one of the men was killed.  Fitzhugh mounted the Colonel's
horse and brought him off.  I am much grieved.  He was always anxious
to go on these expeditions.  This was the first day I assented.  Since
I had been thrown into such intimate relations with him, I had learned
to appreciate him very highly.  Morning and evening have I seen him
on his knees praying to his Maker.

'The righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart, and merciful
men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away
from the evil to come.'  May God have mercy on us all!  I suppose you
are at the Hot Springs and will direct to you there.  Our poor sick,
I know, suffer much.  They bring it on themselves by not doing what
they are told.  They are worse than children, for the latter can be
forced....
