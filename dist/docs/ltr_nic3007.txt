SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a>, in answer to mine proposing a voyage to Bayonne, in which he informs me that the Council of 
the Colony of Connecticut are summoned to meet this day to take the scheme into consideration. This, Sir, is the time to exert ourselves in sending 
to Europe for powder, as the vessels may perform their voyages and return upon this coast in the winter, when the enemy's ships are unable to cruise. 
I have written to our Delegates, strongly recommending it to them to use their influence, that measures 
may be taken to procure sufficient quantities of that necessary article. I have also advised them to move in Congress for opening some lead mines immediately, as the depending upon a precarious supply by sea, when we have such quantities in our own country, seems to me very preposterous. And I believe 
the article in this way will cost us less money than it can be imported for.

Captain Whipple sailed on Tuesday, with sixty-one men on board; his vessel being clean, and every way in good order. I have given him instructions 
to cruise fourteen days off Sandy Hook for the packet, and, if he is so fortunate as to meet her, to take her at all events; to take out of her the arms, 
ammunition, and warlike stores, and to land the letters at South Hampton, and forward them immediately by express. After the taking of the packet, 
or the expiration of the time, he is immediately to proceed to Bermuda, and, if possible, take the powder into possession, without any communication with 
the inhabitants. I have given to him strictly in charge not to make any use of your Address, unless in case of absolute necessity.

The noble example set by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Livery of London, in their late Address to the King, will, I hope, have a good effect in the 
other parts of the kingdom, and, together with the disaffection of the people of Ireland to the iniquitous measures now pursuing against the Colonies, added to 
our own efforts, compel the ministry to depart from their favorite plan of establishing arbitrary power in America.

This letter waits on you by Joshua Babcock, Esq. He is a gentleman of a genteel fortune, a member of our General Assembly, and hath highly distinguished himself in the glorious cause in which America is embarked. I beg leave to recommend him to your Excellency's notice, and am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
