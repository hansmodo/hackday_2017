DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I should very readily have recommended your Son to the 
Care of my Friend Dr. Priestly if he had continued to superintend the Academy at Warrington: But he has left that 
Charge some time since, and is now Pastor of a Congregation at Leeds in Yorkshire. I am much obliged to you for 
introducing me to the Acquaintance of Mr. Erving, who 
appears a very intelligent, sensible Man.

The Governing of Colonies by Instructions has long been 
a favourite Point with Ministers here. About 30 Years since, 
in a Bill brought into Parliament relating to America, they 
inserted a Clause to make the King's Instructions Laws in 
the Colonies, which being opposed by the then Agents, was 
thrown out. And I well remember a Conversation with Lord 
Granville soon after my Arrival here, in which he expressed 
himself on that Subject in the following Terms; "Your 
American Assemblies slight the King's Instructions, pretending that they are not Laws. The Instructions, sent over to 
your Governors, are not like the Pocket Instructions given 
to Embassadors, to be observ'd at their Discretion as Circumstances may require. They are drawn up by grave Men 
learned in the Laws and Constitutions of the Realm; they 
are brought into Council, thoroughly weigh'd, well considered, 
and amended if necessary by the Wisdom of that Body; 
and when receiv'd by the Governors, are the Law of the Land ; 
for the King is the Legislator o) the Colonies" 
</p><p>
I remember this the better, because being new Doctrine 
to me, I put it down as soon as I return'd to my Lodging. 
To be sure if a Governor thinks himself oblig'd to obey all 
Instructions, whether consistent or inconsistent with the Constitution, Laws and Rights of the Country he governs, and can 
proceed to govern in that Train, there is an End of the Constitution, and those Rights are abolish'd. But I wonder, 
that any honest Gentleman can think there is Honour in being 
a Governor on such Terms. And I think the Practice cannot 
possibly continue, especially if opposed with Spirit by our 
Assemblies. At present no Attention is paid by the American 
Minister to any Agent here whose Appointment is not ratified by the Governor's Assent; and if this is persisted in, 
you can have none to serve you in publick Character that do 
not render themselves agreable to these Ministers; those 
otherwise appointed can only promote your Interests by 
Conversation as private Gentlemen or by Writing.

Virginia had, as you observe, two Agents, one for the Council, the other for the Assembly ; but I think the latter only was 
considered as Agent for the Province. He was appoint'd 
by an Act, which expired in the time of Lord Botetourt, and 
was not revived. The other I apprehend continues, but I 
am not well acquainted with the Nature of his Appointment. 
I only understand that he does not concern himself much 
with the general Affairs of the Colony. 
</p><p>
It gives me great Pleasure that my Book afforded any to 
my Friends. I esteem those Letters of yours among its 
brightest Ornaments; and have the Satisfaction to find, 
that they add greatly to the Reputation of American Philosophy.

There is in the Governor's Collection of Papers relative 
to the History of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, published 
<a href='/results.php?year=1769'>1769</a>, a Copy of an Answer made by Randolph to several 
Heads oj Enquiry, which I take to be the same with those I 
sent you. I shall be very glad to have an Account of the present Number of rateables, when you can obtain it for me.

In Ireland among the Patriots I din'd with Dr. Lucas.
They are all Friends of America, in which I said every thing 
I could think of to confirm them. Lucas gave <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a> 
of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> for his Toast. My best respects to Mrs. Bowdoin. 
With sincere and great Esteem, I am, dear Sir, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
