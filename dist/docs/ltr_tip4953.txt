DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
It will he agreeable to you to have an authentic account 
of the recent transactions in this town. 
Last Saturday notifications were posted up in many 
places of the town, by order of the Committee of Correspondence, desiring the inhabitants to assemble at the town- 
house yesterday morning at nine o clock. . . . At eight 
o clock, I received a letter from the Secretary, informing 
me that it was his Excellency the Governor's f desire, that 
I and the rest of the Committee of Correspondence would 
meet him at Colonel Browne's, for he had something of 
importance to communicate to us. We waited on him there 
at nine o clock, as requested. He first asked us if we 
avowed the printed notifications for the meeting of the 
inhabitants at that time. Captain [Richard] Derby, Jr., 
answered in the affirmative. Says the Governor, As you 
assembled the people, tis your duty to disperse them ; you 
are the source, and must abide the consequences. Captain 
Derby replied, Now the people are assembled, they will 
act as they think best. We cannot oblige them to disperse. 
The Governor declared it was an unlawful meeting, for 
the seditious purpose of opposing an act of Parliament. 
Captain Derby answered, Neither we nor the people 
thought we were opposing even an act of Parliament, much 
less the laws of the Province. Says the Governor, I am 
not going to enter into a conversation about the matter, or 
to determine quirks of law; the Attorney-General and 
Colonel Browne (they were present, as well as the Secretary) will inform (or answer) you there. I came here to 
execute the laws, (or acts of Parliament, I forget which,) 
and I am determined to do it. Some other things passed, 
but not material, and the Governor concluded thus: I 
desire you to disperse the meeting of the inhabitants ; if 
they disregard you, the Sheriff will go first; and if they do 
not then disperse, and he needs support, I will support him, 
and the people must abide the consequences. The Governor 
appeared almost the whole time in an indecent passion, and 
uttered the closing sentence with much vehemence. I was 
told by Dr. Holten, yesterday, that the Governor had 110 
rest from the time our notification appeared, scarcely sitting 
half an hour in a day. The Attorney-General and the 
High Sheriff were specially summoned for the purpose, and 
orders were given to the regiment to be in order, who, 
accordingly, equipped themselves as if for battle, and 
marched from their encampment near our fort to the Neck 
gate, where the main body (there are but about three hundred men, and about as many women and children) halted 
and loaded ; then about eighty marched up street, almost 
to brother Williams's. But before this movement of the 
soldiers was known, and whilst we were in at Colonel Browne's, the inhabitants, being assembled at the town- 
house, transacted all the business of the meeting, which 
was merely to choose delegates f for a county meeting to 
be held at Ipswich, on the 6th of September next, and 
were actually broke up before we got to the town-house. 
To-day Colonel Frye, by express orders from the Governor, 
issued a warrant for apprehending the members of the Committee of Correspondence, who ordered the notifications to 
be posted. These were Captain Richard Manning, brother 
Williams, Mr. Jonathan Ropes, Jonathan Gardner, Jr., Mr. Sprague, and myself. Mr. Warwick Palfray was also 
included, though not then present. Captain Derby was 
omitted, being absent through indisposition ; but he had 
expressly desired his brother Gardner to inform the Committee that he was for having a town-meeting. The High 
Sheriff first came and arrested me. I went with him to Frye's. Mr. Sprague came up, and the Sheriff arrested 
him also. Frye told us all that was required was this, 
that we should each recognize in 100, without sureties, 
to appear at the next Superior Court, to be held at Salem 
the first Tuesday in November, to answer to the charge 
against us in the warrant ; which was, for unlawfully and 
seditiously assembling the people without leave from the 
Governor, contrary to the laws and the statute in that case 
lately made and provided. Mr. Sprague asked me what 
was best to be done. I told him I thought we had better 
recognize, which we did. My motives were these : I could 
conceive no prejudice would arise to the cause in complying 
so far. The warrant was issued and executed by lawful 
officers. We need be under no apprehensions of being convicted of any crime, because the juries will be appointed as 
heretofore ; (for I think it clear that no jury can be appointed agreeably to the act, in this county, till next March 
term, and perhaps not till next March twelve months;) or 
if a jury should be packed, (which is scarce possible,) and 
we convicted, we should then have ample reason for a refusal of submission. If we opposed now, and the Governor 
should persist in his attempts to execute the laws, a tumult 
and carnage must ensue ; for the people are exasperated to 
a high degree. These were the reasons I gave the rest of 
the Committee ; and, although they at first thought it would 
have been best to have refused to enter into recognizance, 
yet they appeared entirely to acquiesce, (for the reasons I 
gave,) and I supposed that, when arrested, they would recognize without hesitation. But they have since refused 
before the Justice, Frye, who immediately, I am told, 
posted off to the Governor to inform him of it. They told Frye, however, that they should be ready again to appear 
before him, if summoned. The Governor, I doubt not, 
will pursue the matter ; but I am inclined to think they will 
comply, for the reasons above mentioned, which I shall urge 
this evening at our meeting."
