Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I make use of the first moment to acquaint your 
Excellency, that the whole force of the enemy, which 
has been in Jersey, went from <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> Point 
between twelve and one o'clock this morning. Whether they crossed to Staten Island, or embarked on 
board their shipping, I am not yet sufficiently informed, although it is reported they have embarked 
and proceeded up Hackensac River. To the latter I 
give but little credit. However, I shall take immediate measures to ascertain the truth, and discover 
their present position and designs, as far as is possible. 
</p><p>
I shall do myself the honor to state to your Excellency, as soon as I have leisure, the proceedings 
of yesterday; and, in the interim, I am. 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=nag" rel="me">Nathanael Greene</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. I have ordered <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> to join the 
army under your Excellency's immediate command, 
and beg to receive your directions respecting the remainder of the troops.
