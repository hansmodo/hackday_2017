SIR, 
</p><p>
I feel myself so embarrassed in the duties of the 
department, of which I have the honor to be the 
head, by the Regulations of Congress of the 12th of 
February last, that I beg the favor of your Excellency to represent the matter to that honorable body 
for further consideration. The awkward situation in 
which I am, without any of the powers appertaining 
to the rank of Commanding Officer of Artillery, the 
expectations from me, without the ability to comply, 
and the bad consequences that may arise to the service in general, induce me to make this representation ; and I hope the importance of the subject will 
be a sufficient excuse for the trouble it may give 
your Excellency or Congress. 
</p><p>
In all considerable armies in Europe, a General 
Officer has the command and direction of the artillery, and the preparation of every thing pertaining 
to the ordnance department, and of all species of 
arms and accoutrements, offensive and defensive, be 
longing to a soldier. As his charge is very extensive, he is allowed, for his assistance, commissaries, 
clerks, conductors, founders, and artificers, of all 
branches necessary to his profession; all of whom 
are immediately under his direction and receive his 
orders, and he receives orders and renders an account 
of his conduct to the State that employs him. 
</p><p>
In the British service, the Master-General of Ordnance, or the Commander-in-chief of the Artillery, has a Board of Ordnance, over which he presides, and 
regulates every thing relating to the artillery. This 
Board consists of the Surveyor-General of the Artillery, Clerk of the Ordnance, Storekeepers, and Clerk 
of the Deliveries. There cannot be an instance pointed out, in any service, where the Commissaries or 
Clerks are made independent and unamenable to the 
Commanding Officer of Artillery, as in the Regulations of the Ordnance Department of February 12th. 
</p><p>
It is certainly proper that every head of a department should have the direction of all parts of it; 
otherwise he cannot be considered as amenable for 
any deficiencies, which are out of his power to remedy. In the late Regulations, the Commander of the 
Artillery has no power to give the dimensions or 
construction of any carriages or cannon, however erroneous they may be ; or directions for making post fires, tubes, fuzes, and a thousand other matters, in 
which his profession and the reputation of his corps 
are intimately concerned, and on which the success 
of actions may depend. 
</p><p>
I have made such minutes for alterations of the 
Regulations alluded to as appear to be indispensably 
necessary for the good of the service, and annexed 
them to the resolves. If the Honorable Congress 
think proper to adopt them, I shall be happy, as I 
shall then be in a post to serve my country with 
reputation. I am, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
