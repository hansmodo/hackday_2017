IF I should attempt, my dear Sir, to thank you for the kind 
introductions you have given me to your friends, I could not 
succeed in giving expression to my feelings. You, who know 
how much they are attached to you, will better conceive, than 
I can describe, the cordial reception which these letters procured me. The more I see of Paris, the more sensible I am of 
your sacrifices in leaving it, to traverse a great ocean, and establish yourself with a people, as yet too new to relish that society, which forms here the delight of life. For devoting thus 
to the public service both your time and enjoyments, you have 
as yet been but poorly recompensed. The rich reward re 
mains behind, in that success, which I hope and believe will 
at length crown your efforts to unite the two countries in bonds 
of interest and affection indissoluble.

Your nation is now in a most important crisis, and the great 
question, shall we hereafter have a constitution, or shall will 
continue to be law, employs every mind, and agitates every 
heart in France. Even voluptuousness itself rises from its 
couch of roses, and looks anxiously abroad at the busy scene to 
which nothing can now be indifferent.

Your nobles, your clergy, your people, are all in motion for 
the elections. A spirit, which has been dormant for generations, starts up and stares about, ignorant of the means of obtaining, but ardently desirous to possess its object, consequently, active, energetic, easily led, but also easily, too easily 
misled. Such is the instinctive love of freedom, which now 
grows warm in the bosom of your country. That respect for 
his sovereign, which forms the distinctive mark of a French 
man, stimulates and fortifies on the present occasion those sentiments, which have hitherto been deemed most hostile to monarchy ; for Louis the Sixteenth has himself proclaimed from 
the throne a wish, that every barrier should be thrown down, 
which time or accident may have opposed to the general felicity of his people.

It would be presumptuous in me even to guess at the effects 
of such causes, operating on materials and in situations, of which 
I confess to you the most profound ignorance. I feel that I 
have already gone too far, in attempting to describe what I 
think I have perceived. But before I quit the subject, I must 
express the wish, the ardent wish, that this great ferment may 
terminate, not only to the good, but to the glory of France. 
On the scenes which her great theatre now displays, the eyes 
of the Universe are fixed, even with anxiety, and the national 
honor is deeply interested in a successful issue. Indulge me 
also, I pray, in conveying the opinion, that until that issue be 
known, every arrangement both foreign and domestic must 
feel a pause.

Horace tells us, that in crossing the sea we change our climate, not our souls. I can say,, what he could not, that I find 
on this side of the Atlantic a resemblance to what I left on the other ; a nation which exist in hopes, prospects, and expectations. The reverence for ancient establishments gone, existing 
forms shaken to the very foundation, and a new order of things 
about to take place, in which, perhaps, even the very names of 
all former institutions will be disregarded. 
</p><p>
To judge of the present turmoil, I can give you no better 
standard, than by telling you what is seriously true, that when I 
took up the pen, it was to give you news of your friends, and 
to describe the impression made on my mind by the objects, 
which incessantly present themselves in this great capital, I will 
not say of France, but of Europe. And have I done it ? Yes ; 
for the one great object in which all are engaged has swallowed 
up, like the rod of Aaron in Egypt, every other enchantment 
by which France was fascinated. I am determined, however, 
after having pestered you so much with a recital of what will be 
told you from other quarters much more intelligibly, and with a 
knowledge of all the secret springs which produce those movements, I am determined, I say, that this letter shall give you 
some entertainment; and for this purpose, I shall enclose in it 
several letters from your friends, who have charged me with 
the very agreeable commission of transmitting them to you. 
</p><p>
I will trespass no farther on your patience ; but still I must 
impose the task on your good nature, of presenting my affection 
ate remembrances to my friends, who are about you. I will 
write to them if J have time, but the hours fly so quickly in Pa 
ris ! I will not let them escape me, without assuring you of the 
esteem and respect, with which 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.
