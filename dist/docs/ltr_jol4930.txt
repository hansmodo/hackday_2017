My Dear Father: 
</p><p>
I have barely time to thank you for your kind favour of the eighteenth, and the pleasure of <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker met'>Baron Steuben</a>'s acquaintance. Nothing that depends on me 
shall be wanting to make his stay in camp agreeable, and if he enters into service, to make myself useful to him. I deplore the misfortune of Charlestown if it 
has fallen upon individuals of moderate fortune ; if it affects only a number of rich men, it will contribute to equalizing estates, I shall not regret it. 
</p><p>
Gargon being masculine, requires the article to be of the same gender; therefore, une, which is feminine, 
makes a false concord ; take away the e final and make it un, all will be right. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear father, ever your affectionate and 
</p><p>
dutiful 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
