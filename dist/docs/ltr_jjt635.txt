I have received information that there is below Washington another Brigade besides Sickles' and that they are provided with pontoon trains by which they can cross their Art. & other force in about four (4) hours and that they design doing so with the night at three or four different points, and that the first favorable night is the time fixed upon. That the crossing is to be followed by the reoccupation of Fredericksburg.

The 1st Tennessee leaves for Knoxville at dawn tomorrow morning. Would have left this morning, but I thought it best not to move until something could be heard respecting the time when the cars could receive them, as the weather has been very bad, and the troops are comfortable in their present position, & are within a day's march of Strasburg. Tomorrow at 10 o'clock A.M. the 1st Georgia will leave, and the Regiments for Genl Humes will move in time for their R. R. transportation. As there is no evidence of an immediate move on this place, I do not attach much importance to the information respecting the crossing of the Potomac below you, but have felt it my duty to make mention of it. The information is that the crossing is to be at night. The troops for Manassas can leave at any time via Snicker's Gap; as the boats now there will transport 250 Inft. per trip, but unless I receive further instructions from you, I will keep them as you directed until after the Regiments for the Virginia District leave.
