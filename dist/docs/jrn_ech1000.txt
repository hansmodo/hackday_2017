Six months this afternoon since we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, a period long enough to give us all a dislike to long sea voyages, especially when treated as we have been: being cheated, deceived and belied in every respect relating to our fare. Until within a few days, since leaving port, we have fared tolerably and all seemed willing to move on without any disturbance, but the most essential stores are almost exhausted, butter in the upper cabin is almost consumed, potatoes almost gone, pork getting short; and flour is now getting scarce and to be reserved for fear it may run out in case of a long passage. Our written contract calls for 25 pounds of potatoes per week, and although they furnished some previous to our arrival at Valparaiso, they only purchased enough there to give us a scanty allowance twice per day up to this time.
<p></p>
Now we are to have but one potato, or one and a half, per day, with one pound of flour per week, and
other articles in the same proportion. Indeed the provisioning of the ship at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> exhibited a most unparalleled meanness on the part of the owners, and the supplies purchased at Valparaiso by the Captain, which he declared would be amply sufficient for the remainder of the voyage, show that he is colleagued and identified with the mean and rascally owners, or that he has the most deplorable want of good judgment in the premises. Indeed I have often thought he hardly had capacity enough to take proper charge of a canal boat, let alone a vessel that plows the ocean.
<p></p>
The dissatisfaction concerning our fare constantly increases, and it is not to be wondered at, for these villains have been practicing a shrewd system of plunder upon us ever since we paid them our passage money. Whatever we cannot eat they give us plenty of and whatever we can eat they stint us in, not even giving us as much as our agreement calls for. I am forced to believe them the most systematic robbers I ever heard of.
<p></p>
The water we got at Valparaiso is not nearly as good as the Schuylkill water, and now tastes very stale. We mix it with a little vinegar and sugar, and this makes a fairly good drink.

Yesterday we came up with the whale ship Napoleon of Nantucket, and gave her "skipper" an invitation to come aboard of us. This invitation he accepted and soon his boat was alongside of us with half a dozen good oarsmen. They informed us that they had been out three years and had met with but poor success, having taken but about 1,100 pounds during that time. A short time since, they harpooned four at one time, two of which they secured but the other two escaped after breaking up the boats after them. Some of the
men in one of the boats were out in the water nearly four hours before they were taken up. The seamen had become very tired and hoped to return within a year. They had lately been in port and had plenty of fresh provisions, among other things they had 300 pounds of sweet potatoes. We treated those who would drink (some were teetotalers), gave them books and novels and the latest papers we had, and separated with three cheers on each side.
<p></p>
Last night it was too warm to sleep in our cabin, which is none too well ventilated. I did considerable mending this forenoon and have much more to do, but can scarcely find time to get at it. We have made tent pins for our tent, out of our old pork barrel. Some days since, I made a bag, or knapsack, in case such should be requisite upon our arrival.
<p></p>
Mr. H. has concluded that it would be better for him and his wife not to room together any longer, and in accordance with this has fitted up an extra berth in our cabin.
