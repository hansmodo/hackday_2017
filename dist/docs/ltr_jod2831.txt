I AM much concerned lest you should feel an addition to your anxieties, from your having so seldom heard from me. But I pray you to dismiss all concern 
about me. I am happier far, than I was before the adjournment. My health is better, and business and conversation are much more to my taste.

The surprising intelligence we have in private letters concerning the Director of the Hospital, I has made 
me more cautious of writing than ever. I must be excused from writing a syllable of anything of any 
moment. My letters have been and will be nothing but trifles. I Don't choose to trust the post. I am 
afraid to trust private travellers. They may peep. Accidents may happen ; and I would avoid, if I could, even ridicule, but especially mischief.

Pray, bundle up every paper, not already hid, and conceal them in impenetrable darkness. Nobody knows what may occur.

My love to those who are dearest to us both. Send yours to the care of the gentleman whose care has hitherto been successful. Date them in time, but not place, and assume a new fictitious name.
