DEAR SIR, My last, of the 19th of June, intimated that my 
next would be from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> or this place. I expected it 
would rather have been from the former, which I left a few days 
ago; but my time was so taken up there with my friends and 
some business, that I thought it best to postpone it till my return here. My ride through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, was in the midst of harvest. I found the crops of wheat 
in the upper parts of the two former considerably injured by 
the wet weather, which my last described as so destructive in 
the lower parts of those States. The computed loss where I 
passed was about one-third. The loss in the Rye was much 
greater. It was admitted, however, that the crops of both 
would have been unusually large but for this casualty. Throughout Pennsylvania the wheat was unhurt, and the Rye very little 
affected. 
</p><p>
As I came by the way of Winchester and crossed the Potowmac at Harper's Ferry, I had an opportunity of viewing the 
magnificent scene which nature here presents. I viewed it, however, under great disadvantages. The air was so thick that 
distant objects were not visible at all, and near ones not distinctly so. We ascended the mountain, also, at a wrong place, 
fatigued ourselves much in traversing it before we gained the 
right position, were threatened during the whole time with a 
thunder storm, and finally overtaken by it. Had the weather 
been favorable the prospect would have appeared to peculiar 
advantage, being enriched with the harvest in its full maturity, 
which filled every vale as far as the eye could reach. 
</p><p>
I had the additional pleasure here of seeing the progress of 
the works on the Potowmac. About 50 hands were employed 
at these falls, or rather rapids, who seemed to have overcome 
the greatest difficulties. Their plan is to slope the fall by opening the bed of the river, in such a manner as to render a lock 
unnecessary, and, by means of ropes fastened to the rocks, to 
pull up and ease down the boats where the current is most 
rapid. At the principal falls 150 hands, I was told, were at 
work, and that the length of the canal will be reduced to less 
than a mile, and carried through a vale which does not require 
it to be deep. Locks will here be unavoidable. The undertakers are very sanguine. Some of them who are most so talk 
of having the entire work finished in three years. I can give 
no particular account of the progress on James River, but am 
told it is very flattering. I am still less informed of what is 
doing with North Carolina towards a canal between her and 
our waters. The undertaking on the Susquehannah is said to 
be in such forwardness as to leave no doubt of its success. 
</p><p>
A negociation is set on foot between Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware, for a canal from the head of Chesapeak to 
the Delaware. Maryland, as 1 understand, heretofore opposed 
the undertaking, and Pennsylvania means now to make her 
consent to it a condition on which the opening of the Susquehannah within the limits of Pennsylvania will depend. Unless 
this is permitted, the opening undertaken within the limits of 
Maryland will be of little account. It is lucky that both'parties are so dependent on each other as to be thus mutually forced 
into measures of general utility. I am told that Pennsylvania 
has complied with the joint request of Virginia and Maryland 
for a road between the head of Potowmac and the waters of 
the Ohio, and the secure and free use of the latter through her 
jurisdiction. 
</p><p>
These fruits of the Revolution do great honour to it. I wish 
all our proceedings merited the same character. Unhappily, 
there are but too many belonging to the opposite side of the 
account. At the head of these is to be put the general rage for 
paper money. Pennsylvania and North Carolina took the lead 
in this folly. In the former the sum emitted was not considerable, the funds for sinking it were good, and it was not made a 
legal tender. It issued into circulation partly by way of loan 
to individuals on landed security, partly by way of payment to 
the public creditors. Its present depreciation is about 10 or 12 
per cent. In North Carolina the sums issued at different times 
have been of greater amount, and it has constantly been a tender. It issued partly in payments to military creditors, and, 
latterly, in purchases of Tobacco on public account. The 
Agent, I am informed, was authorised to give nearly the double 
of the current price; and as the paper was a tender, debtors ran 
to him with their Tobacco, and the creditors paid the expence 
of the farce. The depreciation is said to be 25 or 30 per cent. 
in that State. South Carolina was the next in order. Her 
emission was in the way of loans to individuals, and is not a 
legal tender. But land is there made a tender in case of suits, 
which shuts the Courts of Justice, and is, perhaps, as great an 
evil. The friends of the emission say that it has not yet depreciated, but they admit that the price of commodities has risen, 
which is evidently the form in which depreciation will first shew 
itself. 
</p><p>
New Jersey has just issued 30,000 (dollar at 7s. 6c?.) in 
loans to her citizens. It is a legal tender. An addition of 
100,000 is shortly to follow on the same principles. The terror of popular associations stifles, as yet, an overt discrimination between it and specie; but as this does not operate in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, where all the trade of New Jersey is 
carried on, its depreciation has already commenced in those 
places, and must soon communicate itself to New Jersey. New 
York is striking 200,000 (dollar at 8s.) on the plan of loans 
to her citizens. It is made a legal tender in case of suits only. 
As it is but just issuing from the press, its depreciation exists 
only in the foresight of those who reason without prejudice on 
the subject. In Rhode Island, 100,000 (dollar at 6s.) has 
lately been issued in loans to individuals. It is not only made 
a tender, but severe penalties annexed to the least attempt, direct or indirect, to give a preference to specie. Precautions 
dictated by distrust in the rulers soon produced it in the people. Supplies were withheld from the Market, the Shops were 
shut, popular meetings ensued, and the State remains in a sort 
of convulsion. 
</p><p>
The Legislature of Massachusetts at their last session rejected 
a paper emission by a large majority. Connecticut and New 
Hampshire, also, have as yet forborne, but symptoms of danger, 
it is said, begin to appear in the latter. The Senate of Maryland has hitherto been a bar to paper in that State. The 
clamor for it is now universal, and as the periodical election of 
the Senate happens at this crisis, and the whole body is, unluckily, by their Constitution, to be chosen at once, it is probable that a paper emission will be the result. If, in spite of the 
zeal exerted against the old Senate, a majority of them should 
be re-elected, it will require all their firmness to withstand the 
popular torrent. Of the affairs of Georgia I know as little as 
of those of Kamskatska. 
</p><p>
Whether Virginia is to remain exempt from the epidemic 
malady will depend on the ensuing Assembly. My hopes rest 
chiefly on the exertions of Col. Mason, and the failure of the 
experiments elsewhere. That these must fail is morally certain; 
for besides the proofs of it already visible in some States, and 
the intrinsic defect of the paper in all, this fictitious money will 
rather feed than cure the spirit of extravagance which sends 
away the coin to pay the unfavorable balance, and will therefore soon be carried to market to buy up coin for that purpose. 
From that moment depreciation is inevitable. The value of 
money consists in the uses it will serv. Specie will serv.all 
the uses of paper; paper will not serv.one of the essential uses 
of specie. The paper, therefore, will be less valuable than specie. Among the numerous ills with which this practice is pregnant, one, I find, is, that it is producing the same warfare and 
retaliation among the States as were produced by the State 
regulations of commerce. Massachusetts and Connecticut have 
passed laws enabling their citizens who are debtors to citizens 
of States having paper money, to pay their debts in the same 
manner as their citizens who are creditors to citizens of the latter States are liable to be paid their debts. 
</p><p>
The States which have appointed deputies to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a> are 
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia. Connecticut 
declined, not from a dislike to the object, but to the idea of a 
Convention, which it seems has been rendered obnoxious by 
some internal Conventions, which embarrassed the Legislative 
authority. Maryland, or rather her Senate, negatived an appointment, because they supposed the measure might interfere 
with the plans or prerogatives of Congress. North Carolina 
has had no Legislative meeting since the proposition was communicated. South Carolina supposed she had sufficiently signified her concurrence in a general regulation of trade by vesting the power in Congress for 15 years. Georgia . 
</p><p>
Many Gentlemen, both within and without Congress, wish to 
make this meeting subserv.nt to a plenipotentiary Convention 
for amending the Confederation. Tho' my wishes are in favor 
of such an event, yet I despair so much of its accomplishment 
at the present crisis that I do not extend my views beyond a 
commercial Reform. To speak the truth, I almost despair even 
of this. You will find the cause in a measure now before Congress, of which you will receive the detail from Col. Monroe. 
I content myself with hinting that it is a proposed treaty with 
Spain, one article of which shuts up the Mississippi for twentyfive or thirty years. Passing by the other Southern States, 
figure to yourself the effect of such a stipulation on the Assembly of Virginia, already jealous of Northern politics, and which 
will be composed of about thirty members from the Western 
waters; of a majority of others attached to the Western Country from interests of their own, of their friend, or their constituent; and of many others who, though indifferent to Mississippi, 
will zealously play off the disgust of their friends against federal measures. Figure to yourself its effect on the people at 
large on the western waters, who are impatiently waiting for a 
favorable result to the negociation of Gardoqui, and who will 
consider themselves as sold by their Atlantic brethren. Will 
it be an unnatural consequence if they consider themselves absolved from every federal tie, and court some protection for 
their betrayed rights? This protection will appear more attainable from the maritime power of Britain than from any other 
quarter; and Britain will be more ready than any other nation 
to seize an opportunity of embroiling our affairs. 
</p><p>
What may be the motive with Spain to satisfy herself with a 
temporary occlusion of the Mississippi, at the same time that 
she holds forth our claim to it as absolutely inadmissible, is 
matter of conjecture only. The patrons of the measure in Congress contend that the Minister, who at present governs the 
Spanish councils, means only to disembarrass himself at the 
expence of his successors. I should rather suppose he means to 
work a total separation of interest and affection between western and eastern settlements, and to foment the jealousy between 
the Eastern and Southern States. By the former, the population 
of the Western Country, it may be expected, will be checked, 
and the Mississippi so far secured; and, by both, the general 
security of Spanish America be promoted. 
</p><p>
As far as I can learn, the assent of nine States in Congress 
will not at this time be got to the projected treaty; but an unsuccessful attempt by six or seven will favor the views of Spain, 
and be fatal, I fear, to an augmentation of the federal authority, 
if not to the little now existing. My personal situation is rendered by this business particularly mortifying. Ever since I 
have been out of Congress I have been inculcating on our Assembly a confidence in the equal attention of Congress to the 
rights and interests of every part of the Republic, and on the 
Western members, in particular, the necessity of making the 
Union respectable by new powers to Congress, if they wished 
Congress to negociate with effect for the Mississippi. 
</p><p>
I leave to Col. Monroe the giving you a particular account 
of the impost. The acts of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New 
York, must be revised and amended in material points before 
it can be put in force, and even then the fetters put on the collection by some other States will make it a very awkward business. Your favor of 25th of April, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, found me 
here. My letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> at the close of the Assembly 
will have informed you of the situation in which British debts 
stand in Virginia. Unless Congress say something on the subject, I do not think anything will be done by the next session. 
The expectations of the British Merchants coincide with the 
information I had received, as your opinion of the steps proper 
to be taken by the Assembly do with those for which I have 
ineffectually contended. The merits of Mr. Paradise will ensure 
every attention from me to his claim, as far as general principles 
will admit. 
</p><p>
The catalogues sent by Mr. Skipwith I do not expect to receive till I get back to Virginia. If you meet with " Gro3corum 
Respublicaa ab Ubbone Emmio descriptse," Sugd. Batavorum, 
1632, pray get it for me.
