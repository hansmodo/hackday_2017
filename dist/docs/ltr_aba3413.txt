MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I have been situated here for nearly six weeks. It 
is one of the finest squares in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. The air is 
as pure as it can be so near a great city. It is but 
a small distance from Hyde Park, round which I 
sometimes walk, but oftener ride. It resembles 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Common, much larger, and more beautified 
with trees. On one side of it is a fine river. St. 
James's Park and Kensington Gardens are two other 
fashionable walks, which I am very sensible I ought 
to improve oftener than I do. One wants society in 
these places. Airs. Temple is the only person near 
me with whom I can use the freedom of calling 
upon her to ride or walk with me, and her, to my no 
small regret, I am going to lose. Mrs. Hay resides 
out at Hampstead, about four miles from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. 
We visit, but they have such a paltry custom of 
dining here at night, that it ruins that true American 
sociability which only I delight in. Polite circles 
are much alike throughout Europe. Swift's " Journal of a Modern Lady," though written sixty years 
ago, is perfectly applicable to the present day ; and, 
though noted as the changeable sex, in this scene of 
dissipation they have been steady. I shall never 
have much society with this kind of people, for 
they would not like me any more than I do them. 
They think much more of their titles here than in 
France. It is not unusual to find people of the 
highest rank there, the best bred and the politest 
people. If they have an equal share of pride, they 
know better how to hide it. Until I came here, I 
had no idea what a national and illiberal inveteracy 
the English have against their better behaved neighbours, and I feel a much greater partiality for them 
than I did whilst I resided among them. I would 
recommend to this nation a little more liberality and 
discernment ; their contracted sentiments lead them 
to despise all other nations. Perhaps I should be 
chargeable with the same narrow sentiments, if I 
give America the preference over these old European 
nations. In the cultivation of the arts and improvement in manufactures, they greatly excel us ; but 
we have native genius, capacity, and ingenuity, 
equal to all their improvements, and much more 
general knowledge diffused amongst us. You can 
scarcely form an idea how much superior our common people, as they are termed, are to those of the 
same rank in this country. Neither have we that 
servility of manners, which the distinction between 
nobility and citizens gives to the people of this 
country. We tremble not, either at the sight or 
name of majesty. I own that 1 never felt myself in a more contemptible situation, than when 
I stood four hours together for a gracious smile 
from majesty, a witness to the anxious solicitude of 
those around me for the same mighty boon. I however had a more dignified honor, as his Majesty 
deigned to salute me. I have not been since to the 
drawing-room, but propose going to the next. As 
the company are chiefly out of town, the ceremony 
will not be so tedious. 
</p><p>
As to politics, the English continue to publish the 
most abusive, barefaced falsehoods against America 
that you can conceive of; yet, glaring as they are, 
they gain credit here, and they shut their eyes 
against a friendly and liberal intercourse. Yet 
their very existence depends upon a friendly union 
with us. How the pulse of the ministry beats, 
time will unfold ; but I do not promise or wish to 
myself a long continuance here. Such is the temper of the two nations towards each other, that, if 
we have not peace, we must have war. We cannot 
resign the intercourse, and quit each other. I hope, 
however, that it will not come to that alternative. 
Adieu. Your sister, 
</p><p>
A. A.
