My dear General, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure of inclosing two newspapers, 
in which are the debates of the Convention to Saturday, the 19th. They are not forward enough to give 
your Excellency a just state of the business. I therefore am induced to observe that, yesterday, we were 
on the ninth section. The opposition seem now inclined to hurry over the business, and bring on, as 
soon as possible, the main question. However, this 
they are not permitted to do. It is pretty well known 
what objections are on the minds of the people ; it 
becomes, therefore, necessary to obviate them, if possible. We have, hitherto, done this with success. The 
opposition see it, and are alarmed, for there are a 
vast many people attending in the galleries (we now 
assemble in one of our meeting-houses), and most of 
the arguments are published in the papers. Both are 
of use. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will see, in the paper, propositions 
for adopting the Constitution on conditions. This will 
not be attended to. It is possible, if we adopt it absolutely, that the Convention may recommend certain 
amendments. It will never, I presume, be adopted 
on any conditions. It will pass absolutely, or be rejected. I have now higher expectations that it will 
pass than when I last wrote. I think the friends to 
it increase daily. However, I would not raise your 
Excellency's expectations too high. It is yet impossible to determine, absolutely, its fate. Mr. Gerry, as 
mentioned in my last, left the Convention in dudgeon. 
He has not since returned to it. I presume he will 
not return. With the highest esteem, 
</p><p>
I have the honor of being, my dear General, &c., 
</p><p>
