Dear Sik, 
</p><p>
Your very friendly letter of the 1st November last, gratified me not a little. The insurrections had caused disagreeable sensations in this country. The objects and efforts 
of the Jacobin societies in America were well known here ; 
and the fate of our government was considered as being 
involved in that of the insurrection. The manner in which 
it has terminated has given sincere satisfaction to this government, to whom all disorganizing innovations give alarm. 
Their confidence in your wisdom, decision, and energy has 
been confirmed by the event. 
</p><p>
The institution and influence of such societies among us 
had given me much concern, and I was happy in perceiving 
that the suppression of the insurrection, together with the 
character and fall of similar ones in France, would probably operate the extinction of these mischievous associations 
in America. 
</p><p>
Your remarks relative to my negotiations are just and 
kind, and I assure you nothing on my part has been wanting to render the conclusion of them as consonant as was 
possible to your expectations and wishes. 
</p><p>
Perfectly apprized both of my duty and responsibility, I 
determined not to permit my judgment to be influenced by 
any considerations but those of public good, under the direction of my instructions. / knew and know that no attainable settlement or treaty would give universal satisfaction ; 
and I am far from expecting that the one I have signed 
will not administer occasion for calumny and detraction. 
</p><p>
These are evils, which they who serve the people will 
always meet with. Demagogues will constantly flatter 
the passions and prejudices of the multitude, and will never 
cease to employ improper arts against those who will not 
be their instruments. I have known many demagogues, 
but I have never known one honest man among them. 
</p><p>
These are among the other evils which are incident to 
human life, and none of them shall induce me to decline or 
abandon any pursuits, in which I may conceive it to be my 
duty to embark or persevere. All creatures will act according to their nature, and it is absurd to expect that a 
man who is not upright, will act like one who is. The time will come when all books, and histories, and errors 
will be consumed, and when from their ashes truth only 
will rise, and prevail, and be immortal. 
</p><p>
Among my despatches to Mr. Randolph by this ship, is 
a copy of a letter I have received from <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a> at 
Paris, and of two which I have written to him. The expediency of correcting the mistakes which the French Convention seem to have imbibed, will doubtless strike you. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my best compliments to Mrs. 
Washington, and be assured of the perfect respect, esteem, 
and attachment, with which I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
