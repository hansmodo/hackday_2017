MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
DOCTOR CHURCH returns to-day, and, with smarting 
eyes, I must write a few lines to you. I never had 
in my life such severe duty to do, and was never 
worse qualified to do it. My eyes depress my spirits, 
and my health is quite infirm. Yet I keep about, 
and attend Congress very constantly. 
</p><p>
I wish I could write freely to you, my dear, but I 
cannot. The scene before me is complicated enough. 
It requires better eyes, and better nerves than mine ; 
yet I will not despond. I will lay all difficulties prostrate at my feet. My health and life ought to be hazarded in the cause of my country, as well as your's, and all my friends. 
</p><p>
It is impossible to convey, to you any adequate idea of the embarrassments I am under. I wish that 
you and our friends may not be in greater distress than I am. I fear you arc. Pray let me know as 
often as possible. Our friends write to Mr. , not to me, this time. They Don't let us know the state of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> people, nor the state of the army in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, BO exactly as I could wish. 
</p><p>
Two days ago we saw a very wonderful phenomenon in this city ; a field day, on which three battalions of soldiers were reviewed, making full two 
thousand men, battalion men, light infantry, grenadiers, riflemen, light horse, artillery men with a fine 
train, all in uniforms, going through the manual exercise, and the manoeuvres, with remarkable dexterity. AH this has been accomplished in this city since 
the 19th of April ; so sudden a formation of an army never took place any where. 
</p><p>
In Congress we are bound to secrecy. But, under the rose, I believe that ten thousand men will be maintained in the Massachusetts, and five thousand in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, at the continental expense. 
</p><p>
We have a major Skene, just arrived from London with a commission to be Governor of Crown Point 
and Ticonderoga, and surveyor of the woods, &c., a close prisoner. He must dispute for his government with Arnold and Allen. 
</p><p>
My love and duty where due.
