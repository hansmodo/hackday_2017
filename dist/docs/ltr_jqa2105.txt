</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have some reason to suppose that the anti-neutral views 
of the French government extend even to Hamburg and 
Bremen, but their principal object will be the United States. 
They are undoubtedly dissatisfied with the treaty between 
us and Great Britain. This dissatisfaction does not how 
ever proceed from themselves. It has been inspired by 
Americans at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, who foster and encourage it with all 
possible industry, and with ability profoundly systematic. 
From them (though I will not affirm by them) the French 
government are led to believe, that this treaty will finally 
throw the United States a corps perdu into the arms of Britain, that we shall soon be totally lost to France, and that 
unless the treaty can be overturned France must consider 
us henceforth as an infallible ally of Britain against her. 
With such a doctrine, coming from a source which they 
naturally consider as respectable, inculcated and corroborated 
by the personal talents of a man like Hichborn, and counteracted by no one American in France, it may well be sup 
posed that they have taken an alarm against a treaty which, 
but for these incitements, they would have seen with perfect indifference. Whether the late Minister Adet has 
been an obstacle to the furtherance of these views I know 
not, but probably it may be known to our government. 
The principal reason I have to think he did not suit them is, 
that they have never used the common artifices of party 
blazoning to give him weight. Be this as it may, he is re 
called, and a man by the name of Vincent is to go out in 
his stead. It is reported with that sort of mystery which 
intends to spread a secret, that he is to speak a very high 
language to our government, and it seems even to be insinuated that a clue is given him to demand a right which 
it is supposed will bring the British treaty to the test of 
execution. At the same time Mr. Thomas Paine, who lives 
as an inmate in the house of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague">Mr. Monroe</a>, is writing one of 
his efficacious pamphlets upon the subject, and this, his occupation, is announced with much importance, to prepare 
public expectation for the appearance of the production. To all these manoeuvres there will undoubtedly be others 
correspondent in America. At the present stage of things 
</p><p>
I know not upon what the hopes of the party rest, but I think 
it must be upon the refusal of the House of Representatives 
to pass the laws necessary for the execution of the treaty. 
Randolph, who is no longer a body devoid of weight dragged 
along by the current of events ; Randolph, who has been at 
length compelled to decide on his party and, as it should seem, 
even without receiving the purchase money for his duty; 
Randolph, of whom the party are now ashamed, but who 
hopes to retrieve in their eyes his changeable errors by his 
present devotion, has formally taken this ground in their 
behalf, and they will doubtless adhere to it as long as it 
shall be tenable. If the question should be brought for 
ward during the present session of Congress, the operations 
which I have mentioned above will not have time to produce their effect. They will therefore endeavor to pass 
this session without coming to the trial, and reserve all their engines to play upon the next. 
</p><p>
If in conformity to the treaty, the Western posts should be 
delivered up on the first of June, I think that all these plans, 
deeply concerted and ably conducted as they are, will 
fail. The treaty will be fully carried into effect, and with 
out making us the allies of Britain or the enemies of France 
it will preserve our peace for the present with both. But 
will the posts be delivered? I hope they will, though I 
have little confidence in the dispositions of this government, 
and as little in any exertions here to procure the delivery, if it should in any manner depend upon anything to be done 
or said on the part of the United States. 
</p><p>
The French government have perhaps been more readily 
induced to adopt fears and resentments against the treaty, 
from an idea that at present its defeat must be followed by 
a war between us and Britain, a war upon their favorite 
system, which should leave them at liberty to make their peace without binding them to a common cause. They are 
now better prepared for this system of policy than they were 
the last year, for their provisions are in tolerable abundance, 
and they do not depend upon our neutrality for subsistence. 
They are therefore perhaps more strenuously inclined to 
provoke us against Britain, and to enforce the views of the 
party in America who hope for war, because they think it 
would prove the destruction of what Fauchet calls the treasurer's plans. 
</p><p>
There may possibly be another object connected with 
that of stimulating a rupture with Britain, the success of 
which may be considered as important towards that purpose. 
The Presidential elections are to take place in the course 
of the present year. The experiment of an attack upon the 
popularity of the President was made the last autumn and 
winter. It was indeed altogether unsuccessful, but it pre 
pared the way for the repetition of an assault, whenever the 
circumstances should be favorable to the purpose. The 
party are inveterate against the President, because they now 
think him pledged in opposition to their views, and their 
object has therefore been to impress the French rulers with 
an opinion that he is inimical to their cause. This design 
has not been entirely unsuccessful. Fauchet's certificate 
openly avows the idea, and if the accounts I have heard from 
France are true, the style of American conduct and conversation at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> is by no means calculated to remove the impression. That the impression exists 
among the members of the French government Mr. Pinckney since his return here assures me to be the case ; nor is it difficult, 
since Randolph's pamphlet has been published, to trace the origin of the prejudice and some of the motives on which it is founded. 
</p><p>
One of the great negotiators under Lewis the I4th, the Comte d Avaux, lays it down as a fundamental rule, that 
the only successful mode of treating with the Dutch Republic 
is by a constant and unremitting excitement of fear in the 
minds of the ruling men. This maxim is not laid down in Mably's principles of negotiation, but its application appears to have survived the French monarchy, and to be 
transferred beyond the Atlantic. It may be remembered 
how Genet in all his newspaper controversies perpetually 
threatened us with the vengeance of his Republic, and how 
faithfully his subalterns echoed his terrific strains. Since 
his time the French Ministers have been more guarded in 
their menaces, but the party have been very indulgent to 
wield the same weapon for them. Thus Mr. Randolph not 
only talks now of the "crisis which he fears may disturb our 
harmony with France" but even in August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>, could 
speak of " the hazard of mortally offending the French" How? 
Why, "by the punctilious observance of neutrality" Thus 
many a letter from France has been written for the American 
public to raise an opinion of French resentment against the 
treaty, when nothing but the desire to stimulate that resentment existed. Thus we are in future to be told that France 
will defeat our treaty with Algiers, that she will shut us out 
from a participation of her commerce, perhaps even that she 
is at the point of declaring war against us. All these things 
are bottomed upon the principle of d Avaux, and perhaps 
others, which may be supposed to contain powers of personal operation upon the feelings of our first magistrate, will 
continue to be employed, however discouraging the ill success of the former attempts may have been. 
</p><p>
On one hand therefore he will be courted by the prospect of every support from the party, and on the other that of an 
opposition at least against the unanimity which marked the 
two preceding elections, will be suffered to be seen, under 
an expectation that it will have its influence in conciliating 
the sentiments of the person to the measures of the party. 
If this should not succeed, the attack of the last season will 
be renewed with redoubled impetuosity, and if they cannot 
hope to turn the balance of election they flatter themselves 
that at least they can induce retirement or resignation from 
the disgust of ill treatment. Such it seems according to Fauchet's letter was the policy upon which the persecution 
against Mr. Hamilton was conducted, and they will have double reasons for pursuing it in this instance. 
</p><p>
The removal of the President, however effected in the 
tactics of the combined French and party powers, is to be 
followed by a plan for introducing into the American Constitution a Directory instead of a President, and for taking 
from the supreme Executive the command of the armed 
force. This hopeful project has been intimated to you in a 
former letter. How far it has been shaped and organized 
I know not; whether the course of events will prevent its 
advancement as a practical measure I shall not pretend to 
say ; but of the design to bring it forward at the first favor 
able moment I have not the shadow of a doubt. 
</p><p>
The great error of the party in America has uniformly been 
to grasp at too much, to place too great a dependence upon 
the efficacy of their exertions, and to calculate upon a 
popular temper much more favorable to their views than 
the fact has ever proved. Notwithstanding all their experience I think they are repeating the same mistake, and 
I consider this as one of the indications that they will eventually fail in their present as they have heretofore done in 
their former objects. They now build their principal hopes 
upon the non-delivery of the forts, and there is no circumstance that would so much confound and mortify them as a 
faithful execution of the treaty by the British in that article. 
This circumstance is so obvious, that it might be urged with 
great force as an inducement to decide this government if 
they were wavering on the point. The mode of introducing 
the argument would indeed be a delicate point, but I am sure 
it would have weight. Perhaps it has been or will be urged. 
</p><p>
They take for granted that there will be no delivery. This 
they presume will of course produce a refusal on our part to 
carry the treaty into execution, the result of which will be 
a decisive rupture between us and Britain, and a consequent 
triumph of French party, French principles, and French 
influence in the United States. 
</p><p>
It is, however, now so late in the season that the present 
year may be considered as secured, and by the close of this 
campaign it appears probable that even France and Britain 
will be prepared for serious negotiation. The increasing 
clamors for peace on both sides of the channel will perhaps 
compel the two governments to meet upon some composition of terms, and in that case neither France, nor her humble 
adorers in America, will be so strenuous to provoke the quarrel, as they have been hitherto, and still are. 
</p><p>
Against the maritime supremacy of this country, the 
French government will indeed have a permanent motive to 
unite her own powers with others ; nor do I think it an object to be neglected by any of the powers to whom the liberty 
of commerce and navigation is interesting. The principles 
of the armed neutrality, which have been so long dispersed 
by the hurricane of the revolutionary contest, may again 
be collected as the storm subsides, and at this day all the 
governments which acceded to that system originally, are 
doubtless again convinced of its importance, with the exception only of Russia. It will indeed after the termination 
of the present war be more important than ever, because the 
naval preponderance of Britain will then be greater than it 
has been at any former period. If, therefore, independent 
of the present contest, a plan should be proposed for concerting the means to check the spirit of domination upon 
the sea, which Britain has so long avowed, and which be 
comes formidable in proportion as her comparative strength 
augments, the government will without doubt give it all 
the consideration that may be proper. . . .
