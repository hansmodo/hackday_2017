MAJOR-GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=knoxville' rel='city origin'>Knoxville</a>, Tenn. : 
</p><p>
I deem it of the utmost importance to drive <a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel='colleague adversary met'>Longstreet</a> out immediately, so as to furlough the balance of our veterans, and 
to prepare for a spring campaign of our own choosing, instead of permitting the enemy to dictate it for us. Thomas is ordered to 
start ten thousand men, besides the remainder of Granger's corps, at once. He will take no artillery, but will take his artillery 
horses, and three mules to one hundred men. He will probably start next Monday.

U. S. GRANT, 
</p><p>
Major- General.
