ONE year ago this day I was hard at work in the Feather River mountains, whenever the rains would permit, in building a fireplace and finishing off a comfortable cabin on a claim which I had taken up, with the bright anticipation that at the present writing I would be comfortably seated in a snug, carpeted room at home, with my family around me and a few friends, discoursing upon the wonders which I had seen, of the perils I had encountered, and showing with honest pride the curious specimens which I had picked up in the mines of California; and what has been the result? The building was completed, the work done, and I never worked so hard in my whole life. I lived with the utmost prudence and calculated to a nicety, but not only that claim, but twelve others in which I was interested, failed--all failed, and not a dollar was obtained, and by the changes incident to the country, I have become a resident and man of business in the most astonishing city of the Union. And yet I should not complain--nor do I.
</p><p>
With only four dollars in my pocket when I arrived at Sacramento City last year, I have contrived to handle thousands, and although a great deal of it would not stick to my fingers; yet some of it did, and a portion of it is in a shape which neither "moth will corrupt nor thieves break through and steal," being a farm on the navigable waters of Feather River You never would dream that the True Delta had been the cause of my being a resident of San Francisco; yet such is the fact. You know the history of my first
acquaintance with Colonel Grant. By his solicitation I became your correspondent, and that correspondence made us acquainted with each other, which soon ripened into intimacy, and the True Delta was a bond of union between us. When I came down from the Gold Lake mountains in October, I paid Colonel Grant a friendly visit and, at his invitation, visited San Francisco for the first time, which resulted in my establishing myself for the time being in business here.

Had it not been for the True Delta my first acquaintance with Colonel Grant would have ended where it began, at Mud Hill, and had it not been for the True Delta, I should not have classed among my friends one of the most generous, noble-hearted gentlemen I ever knew, despite of all his eccentricities.

Men who live isolated in the mountains know but little of what is going on in the Valley, only in a general way, and those who live in the cities can scarcely understand and appreciate fully what is going on in the mines. Conflicting accounts often reach both parties, and I hesitate to describe only what I see. What I have written of the mountain region and such portions of California which I have seen, I have no reason to change. I simply described it as I saw it. I am now in a new sphere, and with a change of season, a change of climate, and a great change of association, I find myself in quite a new scene. And if I could make it pay I would vary the scene still more, for I would see the whole country--aye--and other countries too.
</p><p>
Last year, from the 3rd of November till about the 1st of February, it was pouring down "from the flood gates of Heaven" like big guns. The rivers overflowed their banks and more than one quarter of the Valley was submerged. This year, up to the present time, there has not been near as much rain as is usual at home, and the weather has been luxuriously pleasant.
</p><p>
The climate on the Coast I think is healthy and decidedly desirable for a residence, and were it not for three especial reasons--a wife and two children at home--I should not think of returning. The valley of Santa Clara and the country around San Jose produce the finest vegetables in the world, as our markets, well supplied, abundantly testify, and when California shall have disenthralled herself of the immorality, the vice, and hordes of Mexican and Sydney villains, as well as a sprinkling from other countries, this portion of it will be desirable as a home.

But now we are in a crisis, the result of which must bring ruin and misfortune to a multitude of individuals, though it may end in substantial benefit to the country. A failure in the mines, as well as a failure in the city, throws men upon their individual resources;
and as the best business which has been followed the past season has been that of horticulture, thousands, by a natural impulse, are looking to Mother Earth for her bounty to replenish their pockets. This, of course, will develop the agricultural resources of the country, as well as find a permanent and industrious population employment. The country at this moment is overstocked with merchandise and provisions. In the mines, unless it may be in those most distant, there is more than can be sold during the winter; and this is the case in all the towns. Everything imported from the States is selling at a ruinous sacrifice, and as the want of rain in the mines prevents the dry diggings from being productive, less gold is obtained than was anticipated, a portion of which would go to pay for these goods. As soon as the upper towns and mines were supplied this fall, the price of many kinds of goods fell ninety per cent. Add to this the exorbitant rents demanded for any place to do business in, and you will not be surprised to hear of failures.

There seems to be a universal stagnation in trade, and although there may be millions to loan on good security, scarcely any businessman who is compelled to borrow can give the security required. A few days since I saw the invoice of a large lot of desirable goods for this market charged at Boston prices, and at higher rates than could be bought for here. Day before yesterday a finished house which had been sent out on speculation, which was said to have cost nearly four thousand dollars, was sold at auction to pay freight and brought eight hundred. This is a very common occurrence; and when a man wants to build, he watches his chance to find a vessel selling off a cargo of lumber at auction to pay charges. Beautiful crushed sugar is selling at 12 1/2 cts.; best quality of lard at 10 and 12 1/2 cts.; sugar-cured hams, in prime order, at 12 1/2 cts.; pickles in quart jars sold a few days since at $1.12 1/2 cts. per dozen. Arrivals of cargoes of merchandise are almost of daily occurrence, and we are advised that heavy shipments are on the way, so that I see no reason why this state of things may not continue for months to come.

I received, a few weeks since, a large consignment of goods to sell on commission, and I have hardly sold enough to get back the small advances which I made upon them. Men are resorting to new methods of disposing of stocks, chiefly fancy goods, and that is by lottery. Heavy amounts of rich jewelry, and even a public house, are offered for sale in this way, tickets selling for from one to five dollars. But one of the most recent humbugs which has been got up is the astonishing discovery of Gold Bluff, up towards Klamath River. The very sand is so rich that it contains about one-tenth gold--so they say. A vessel has just returned from there with specimens of sand, but the company, instead of loading their ship down with the precious metal, have formed a joint stock company with a
capital of a hundred thousand dollars and are selling off shares at a hundred dollars a head. What fools--when they could have made so much more by a week's work in sifting gold at the Bluff--ahem! But fools are not all dead, and they are actually making large sales of shares. I have seen several gentlemen of intelligence who have visited the spot, who say that it is a ridiculous humbug.
