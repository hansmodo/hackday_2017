</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you, that I arrived 
here at a very critical moment with my brigade. 
General Thompson was left but with very few men 
to defend this important post, the troops being scattered about in a most shocking manner. I had is 
sued orders for all the well men to follow me, as, 
upon departure of <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague'>General Wooster</a> and the death of 
General Thomas, the command devolved upon me. 
</p><p>
Having given these orders, I proceeded, with the 
troops I brought with me, to join General Thompson, 
who was in the greatest distress. As General Carleton's fleet had passed the <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, and was coming up 
the river with a fair wind (as was reported in all 
quarters), a retreat seemed in all parts to be agreed 
upon; and the heavy baggage and most of the artillery were removed to St. John's and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>. This 
caused the Frenchmen to curse our cowardice, and 
lament their folly in favoring a cause which we had 
so poorly defended ; but, upon my coming with a 
large force, ordering all the troops to follow, and the 
cannon to be returned, I found joy in every countenance, except some very few Tories. It really was 
affecting to see the banks of the <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a> lined with 
men, women, and children, leaping and clapping their 
hands for joy to see me arrive ; it gave no less joy 
to General Thompson, who seemed to be wholly forsaken, and left to fight against an unequal force, or 
retreat before them. 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival I was surprised to hear that, 
notwithstanding all we have read about the <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, 
our people had not thrown up as much work as I 
could do with a hundred men in two days, and that 
extremely ill done. There were three cannon, and 
three only, mounted in all the works. I set all the 
men at work, and have this day almost inclosed the 
encampment, and completed a battery on the north 
side of the river, with three cannon. General Thompson says, and I believe with great truth, that more 
work was done here this day than has been done in Canada since the surrender of St. John s. 
</p><p>
June Qt/i, This morning two expresses arrived from 
Three Rivers, which were sent to observe the motions 
of the enemy ; one of them was a friendly Canadian, 
who lived at Three Rivers, and passed among the 
fleet, the other one of our officers. They agree that 
the number of vessels are as follows, namely, one ship, 
one brig, and eight sloops and schooners. They both 
say that the troops there amount to no more than 
three hundred, who are intrenching themselves at the Three Rivers. I have detached General Thompson, with about two thousand of your best troops, to at 
tack them. A copy of his orders is inclosed, which I hope will be approved by your Excellency. 
</p><p>
Our affairs here have taken a strange turn since 
our arrival. The Canadians are flocking by hundreds 
to take a part with us. I am giving them commissions, agreeable to the inclosed form, which I hope 
will not be thought an unnecessary assumption of 
power. I really find most of them exceedingly friendly. I have sent out for carts and teams, &c. They 
have come in with the greatest cheerfulness ; and, 
what gives still greater evidence of their friendship 
is, that they have voluntarily offered to supply us 
with what wheat, flour, &c., we want, and ask nothing 
in return but certificates. -They begin to complain 
against their priests, and wish them to be secured ; 
I shall, however, touch this string with great tenderness at present, as I know their sacerdotal influence. 
</p><p>
I really find, by the present behaviour of the Canadians, that the only reason of their disaffection was 
because our exertions were so feeble that they doubted much of our success, and even of our ability to 
protect them; but the face of our affairs seems to be 
changed; and, in the midst of our pleasing prospects, 
an express arrives from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, with six 
teen hundred and sixty-two pounds one shilling and 
three pence, Pennsylvania currency, in specie, with the 
spirited resolves of Congress. This gives new life to 
our Canadian friends, and added spirit to our troops. 
</p><p>
I was extremely happy to find, that I had anticipated the wishes of Congress, and had, through every 
embarrassment, pressed downward toward the import 
ant posts they wished; for it was my fixed determination to gain post at Dechambeau, which I mean 
to fortify so as to make it inaccessible. This commands the channel, secures the country, destroys the 
communication, and affords a safe retreat, if we are 
obliged to make one. General Thompson was embarking for that purpose, when the resolves arrived. 
The ships are now above that place ; but if General 
Thompson succeeds at Three Rivers, I will soon remove the ships below Richelieu Falls, and after that 
approach towards Quebec as fast as possible ; and, according to the present appearance of affairs, may Exceed in number the Hanoverians, &c., which we are 
threatened with. I have no doubt of the general attachment of the Canadians, though I suppose some 
unprincipled wretches among them will always appear against us; but a vast majority will be for us, 
and perhaps as many, according to their numbers, 
are really in our favor as in some other Colonies 
upon the Continent. Many of them are with General Thompson in this expedition, and great numbers are 
here, ready equipped, waiting my orders. 
</p><p>
I may venture to assure you and the Congress 
that I can, in a few days, reduce the army to order 
and, with the assistance of a kind <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, put a 
new face to our affairs here, which a few days since 
seemed almost impossible. General Thompson and 
the Baron de Woedtke have done every thing in 
their power to assist me. <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> has not 
joined me, being, as you may see by his letter, 
which I inclose to you, much engaged at Montreal, 
upon affairs of importance. The post at La Chine, 
which he mentions, I can by no means consent to 
afford such a large body of men to defend against a 
petty number of savages, little else than a mob. I 
have, therefore, ordered a small fortification to be 
thrown up by Colonel Dehaas's party, consisting of about nine hundred men ? and made inaccessible, at 
least to savages, and garrisoned it with two hundred 
men ; the rest to return to me, as all our operations 
ought to be down the river, where, if we are successful, the insurrection there will die, of course. I 
have ordered a month's provision to be lodged there, 
lest an excuse of surrendering, for want of provision, 
before we can relieve it, should take place, as at the 
Cedars. I do not think it a post of great importance, or, indeed, any in our rear, except St. John's 
and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, which will ever secure a retreat, and 
to these I will pay particular attention. 
</p><p>
I hope, dear General, to give you, in a few days, 
some agreeable intelligence ; while I remain, with the 
most profound respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">JOHN SULLIVAN</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I shall soon obtain proper returns of our 
scattered army, and will forward them, with return 
of stores, &c. ; after which you may expect them 
weekly. I have, for your diversion, inclosed to you 
one which is similar to what the other Colonels must 
make, if called upon. I inclose to your Excellency a 
letter from Colonel Duggan. I have appointed a 
Court of Inquiry into the accusation against him. I 
am informed, by General Thompson, Mr. Bromfield, 
and others, that the accusation is false, and that he 
is a very useful man. He has, at my request, since 
he wrote the above letter, raised and armed upwards 
of two hundred men for us. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be your Excellency's most 
obedient servant, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">JOHN SULLIVAN</a>. 
</p><p>
As I have not time to write the Congress, I beg 
your Excellency to forward to them a copy of this.
