My dear General, 
</p><p>
In the midst of our internal troubles, it is a comfort to me that I may rejoice in the happy prospects 
that open before my adoptive country. Accounts 
from America give me every reason to hope the new 
Constitution will be adopted. Permit me once more, 
my beloved General, to insist on your acceptance of 
the Presidency. The Constitution, as it is proposed, 
answers most of the purposes ; but, unless I am much 
mistaken, there are some parts which would not be 
quite free of some danger, had not the United States 
the good fortune to possess their guardian angel, who 
may feel the advantages and inconveniences of every 
article, and will be able, before he retires again, to 
ascertain to what degree Government must necessarily 
be energetic, what power might be diverted into a 
bad use, and to point out the means to attain that 
perfection to which the new Constitution is already 
nearer than any past or present Government.

The affairs of France are come to a crisis; the more 
difficult to manage, as the people in general have no 
inclination to go to extremities. Liberty or death is 
not the motto on this side of the Atlantic; and, as 
all classes are more or less dependent, as the rich 
love their ease, and the poor are depressed by want 
and ignorance, the only way is to reason or persuade 
the nation into a kind of passive discontent or non-obedience, which may tire out the levity, and undo 
the plans, of Government. The Parliaments, notwithstanding the inconveniences attending them, have 
been necessary champions to stand forth. You will 
see by the publications (for we have sent over every 
thing), that the King has assumed pretensions, and 
the Courts of Justice have stated principles, which so 
widely differ, that one could hardly believe those assertions were made in the same country and century. 
Matters could not rest there. 
</p><p>
Government have employed the force of arms 
against unarmed magistrates, and expelled them. 
And the people ? you will say. The people, my 
dear General, have been so dull, that it has made 
me sick, and physicians have been obliged to cool 
my inflamed blood. What has the more wound up 
my anger, is a Bed of Justice wherein the King has 
established a Cojir Pleniere, composed of Judges, Peers, 
and courtiers, without a single Representative. And 
these Ministers had the impudence to say, that all 
taxes and loans should be registered. Thank God, 
we have got the better! and I begin to hope for a 
Constitution. The Magistrates have refused sitting in 
the Coiir Pieniere. The Peers, who are thirty-eight (a 
few of them have sense and courage), will not, however obey. Some, like my friend La Rochefoucaiild, 
behave nobly ; the others follow at a distance. The 
Parliaments have unanimously protested, and made 
an appeal to the nation. Most of the inferior Courts 
reject the new regimen. Discontents break out everywhere, and in some Provinces are not despicable. 
The clergy, who happen to have an Assembly, are 
remonstrating. The lawyers refuse to plead. Government is embarrassed, and begins to apologize. Their 
Commandants have been in some parts pursued with 
dirt and stones; and, in the midst of these troubles 
and anarchy, the friends of liberty are daily reenforced, shut up their ears against negotiations, and say 
they must have a National Assembly, or nothing. 
Such is, my dear General, our bettering situation ; 
and I am, for my part, very easy, when I think that 
I shall, before long, be in an Assembly of the Representatives of the French nation, or at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. 
</p><p>
I am so taken up with these affairs, that I can tell 
you but little of the European politics. My disapprobation of Ministerial plans, and what little exertions I could make against them, have induced me to 
cease my visits to the Archbishop's house ; and the 
more I have been connected with him and the Keeper of the Seals, the greater indignation I have professed against their infernal plan. 
</p><p>
I am glad our American Arret du Conseil has taken 
place before the full tide of these troubles ; and am 
now, through other Ministers, endeavouring to bring 
about a plan for the total enfranchisement of duties 
on whale oil, which would put the American merchants on the same footing with the French, even 
with respect to bounties, and that without obliging 
the fishermen to leave their native shores. Should 
we succeed in that, our next o}3Ject must be the trade with the West Indies.

I am happy in the Ambassador we have in this 
country; and nothing can excel <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>'s abilities, virtues, pleasing temper, and every thing in him 
that constitutes the great statesman, zealous citizen, 
and amiable- friend. He has a young gentleman with 
him, Mr. Short, a Virginian, who is a very able, engaging, and honest man. This letter will be delivered 
by JNI. de Warville, a man of letters, who has written 
a pamphlet against Chastellux's journal ; but is, however, very clever, and wishes very much to be presented to 3'ou. He intends to write the history of 
America, and is, of course, very desirous to have a 
peep at your papers, which appears to me a deserved 
condescension, as he is very fond of America, writes 
pretty well, and will set matters in a proper light. 
He has an officer with him whom I also beg leave 
to recommend; M. de la Teniere is his name. 
</p><p>
But to come to politics. I must tell you that the 
war between the Imperial Powers and the Turks is 
going on. The Emperor has made several attempts ; 
but there is a fatality in that man which makes him 
ever begin and never finish any thing. The skirmishes have generally been doubtful. He has taken a 
town ; but was severely brushed in another assault, 
and the same day met with a second defeat. These 
matters, however trifling, show that the Turks are 
either very ill-attacked, or more lucky than we did 
expect. The siege of Belgrade will be the grand expedition that way, and is not begun. There has been 
a junction made of the Austrians and Russians in 
another quarter ; but they have not sufficient means 
to operate. The grand army of the Russians are 
moving towards Oczakow, which Prince Potemkin, a 
former lover and the bosom friend of the Empress, is 
going to besiege. Paul Jones has entered the Russian service, and "will command a squadron on the 
Black Sea. All the powers are negotiating for a 
peace; but, at the same time, Sweden and Denmark 
are arming. There will be observation fleets; and it 
is expected that a peace will take place this winter. 
We must, of course, wish for decisive actions. Should 
they be unfavorable to the Christians, it may disgust 
them; and you never can get a concession from the 
Turks, until the Prophet has shown his displeasure, 
by suffering them to be flogged. In case both parties maintain their ground, a general war is apprehended for the next year.

I beg, my dear General, you will present my most 
affectionate respects to Mrs. Washington and to your 
respected mother. Remember me to the family, the 
young ones, your relations; to all friends. Madame 
de Lafayette and children join in the best respects 
to you and Mrs. Washington. My younger daughter, 
Virginia, is now under inoculation. Adieu, my beloved General. I do not live one day without grieving for the hard separation w^hich deprives me of 
the blessed sight of what is dearest to me, and 
leaves me so few opportunities to tell you, with all 
the love of a devoted heart, that I am, forever, with 
the most affectionate respect. 
</p><p>
Your filial, grateful friend, 
</p><p>
