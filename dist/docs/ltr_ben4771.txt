DEAR SIR, <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city origin'>London</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="9">Sept</a> ' <a rel='day origin' value='3'>3</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1769' rel="origin">1769</a>

Your favour of Aug' 3d has given me great Pleasure. I 
have only time now to acknowledge the Receipt of it, but 
purpose to write fully by the next Opportunity. I am just 
returned from France, where I found our Dispute much 
attended to, several of our Pamphlets being translated and 
printed there, among the rest my Examination and the 
Farmer's Letters? with two of my Pieces annexed, of which 
last I send you a Copy. In short, all Europe (except Britain) 
appears to be on our side the question. But Europe has its 
Reasons. It fancies itself in some Danger from the Growth 
of British Power, and would be glad to see it divided against 
itself. Our prudence will, I hope, long postpone the Satisfaction our Enemies expect from our Dissensions. With 
sincere and great Esteem, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble Serv' 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
