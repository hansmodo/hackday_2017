Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am favored with yours of the twenty-sixth of July,  for 
which I pray you to accept my thanks. I mentioned to you 
from London, that Mr Walpole had been offered the place of 
Envoy Extraordinary to the United States, which he had refused. I took care to avoid any sort of intercourse with the 
government while I was there, and of course could not possess 
any minute information worthy of your notice. I avoided also 
seeing any of the chiefs of opposition, lest some conclusions of 
a disagreeable nature should be drawn from that circumstance. 
Of course it was not until my arrival in this city, that I learnt 
(from the British Ambassador here) what had been done. 
Mr Hammond was sent for from Spain, and passed through 
this city while I was in London. I do not know whether he is gone out ; if not, you have long since I suppose received the 
communication of his appointment. The plan seems to have been that which I long since mentioned, viz. the sending out a 
minister with letters of credence in his pocket, to be delivered when you shall appoint one to their court. 
</p><p>
From a variety of small circumstances I am convinced, that the British cabinet begins very seriously to consider its situation in respect to us. The rapid rise of our credit, the wise 
decisions of our courts, the general peace and order which 
prevail, and the gradual display of our population, wealth, and 
industry, produce very great effect upon their minds. Let 
me add that the calm dignity of those, who are at the head of 
our affairs, has a considerable influence. Events confirm me 
in the opinion, which I formed from an attentive consideration of the subject, and I think we may calculate almost with 
certainty on forming a good treaty with that country, as soon as 
they shall determine to form any treaty ; and until that time, 
I agree fully with you, that attempts on our part should be such 
only, as to justify to the world that conduct which it becomes 
us to pursue. I know that among the many, whose duty or 
occupation it may be to consider this subject, there must be a 
variety of opinions, because dispositions differ, because prejudices exist, because interests sway, in a word, because men are 
men ; but Time will set his seal of truth on that which is right. 
I am, &tc.
