Miriam and I have disgraced ourselves! This morning I was quietly hearing Dellie's lessons, when 
I was startled by mother's shrieks of "Send for a guard they've murdered him!" I saw through the 
window a soldier sitting in the road just opposite, 
with blood streaming from his hand in a great pool 
in the dust. I was downstairs in three bounds, and, 
snatching up some water, ran to where he sat alone, 
not a creature near, though all the inhabitants of our 
side of the street were looking on from the balconies, 
all crying "Murder!" and "Help!" without moving 
themselves. I poured some water on the man's 
bloody hand, as he held it streaming with gore up to 
me, saying, "The man in there did it," meaning the 
one who keeps the little grog-shop, though it puzzled 
me at the time to see that all the doors were closed 
and not a face visible. I had hardly time to speak 
when Tiche called loudly to me to come away, she was safe at the front gate, and looking up, I 
found myself in a knot of a dozen soldiers, and took 
her advice and retreated home. It proved to be the 
guard Miriam had roused. She ran out as I did, 
and seeing a gentleman, begged him to call the guard 
for that murdered man. The individual he must 
have been a "patriot" said he didn't know where 
to find one. She cried out they were at Heroman s; 
he said he didn't believe they were. "Go! I tell 
you!" she screamed at last; but the brave man said 
he didn't like to, so she ran to the corner and called 
the soldiers herself. O most brave man ! Before we 
got back from our several expeditions, we heard 
mother, Lilly, Mrs. Day, all shouting, "Bring in the 
children ! lock the doors ! etc. All for a poor wounded 
soldier! 
</p><p>
We after discovered that the man was drunk, and 
had cursed the woman of the grog-shop, whereupon 
her husband had pitched him out in the street, where 
they found him. They say he hurt his hand against 
a post; but wood could never have cut deep enough 
to shed all that gore. I don't care if he was drunk or 
sober, soldier or officer, Federal or Confederate! If 
he had been Satan himself lying helpless and bleeding in the street, I would have gone to him! I can't 
believe it was as criminal as though I had watched 
quietly from a distance, believing him dying and 
contenting myself with looking on. Yet it seems it 
was dreadfully indecorous; Miriam and I did very 
wrong; we should have shouted murder with the rest 
of the women and servants. Whereas the man who 
declined committing himself by calling one soldier 
to the rescue of another, supposed to be dying, acted 
most discreetly, and showed his wisdom in the most 
striking manner. 
</p><p>
May I never be discreet, or wise, if this is Christian conduct, or a sample of either! I would rather 
be a rash, impetuous fool ! Charlie says he would not 
open his mouth to save a dozen from being murdered. 
I say I am not Stoic enough for that. Lilly agrees 
with him, Miriam with me; so here we two culprits 
stand alone before the tribunal of "patriotism." 
Madame Roland, I take the liberty of altering your 
words and cry, "O Patriotism! How many base 
deeds are sanctioned by your name!" don't I 
wish I was a heathen! In twenty-four hours the 
whole country will be down on us. 
</p><p>
O for a pen to paint the slaves 
</p><p>
Whose "country" like a deadly blight! 
</p><p>
Closes all hearts when Pity craves 
</p><p>
And turns God's spirit to darkest night! 
</p><p>
May life's patriotic cup for such 
</p><p>
Be filled with glory overmuch; 
And when their spirits go above in pride, 
</p><p>
Spirit of Patriotism, let these valiant abide 
Full in the sight of grand mass-meeting I don't 
</p><p>
Want you to cuss them, 
But put them where they can hear politics, 
</p><p>
And yet can't discuss them! 
</p><p>
(I can't say worse than that!)
