MY DEAR SIR I congratulate you most sincerely on your safe arrival, and your return to your family and country. I hope you found the former in good health; 
the latter I am very sure will at all times be benefited by the assistance oi' so able a citizen, and the more so especially at this time, when the most important of all 
sublunary things is under consideration, the establishment of a government. Independently of the general principle of philanthropy, I feel myself interested in the 
establishment of a wise and free republican government in Massachusetts, where yet I hope to finish the remainder of my days. The hasty, unpersevering, aristocratic 
genius of the south suits not my disposition, and is inconsistent with my views of what must constitute social happiness and security. 
</p><p>
It is not long since I received your favour of February 13th, from Paris. So far as immediate personal ease and happiness are the objects, it is beyond a doubt that 
the life of a private citizen is more desirable than any public character whatever, and especially such as carry us from home. But, my friend, we must consider that 
individual happiness flows from the general felicity ; and the security of the whole is the safety of particulars. 
What must become of the American cause and character, if her councils at home and abroad are to be filled and conducted by half tones, ambitious, avaricious and 
wicked men ? These considerations induce me to wish. that you would not give up the thoughts of public service ; until our affairs are better settled. I wish with 
all my heart that the Chevalier De La Luzerne and Mr. De Marbois had originally come here. I do assure you, it would greatly have benefited the cause of the 
alliance and the United States. Such scenes of wicked intrigue as I never expected to take place in America, until the maturity of time and luxury with ks consequent 
train of vices, bad ripened us for destruction ! You will no doubt be fully informed by others concerning the proceedings of a faction dangerous to our country, and 
very disgraceful also. October 13th, I had written thus far and stopped, having no opportunity of immediate 
conveyance, when my friends from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, informed me of the crowning work of more than a year's intrigue, that malice was at last glutted to satiety. It 
seems the party were under the necessity of employing a proper man. I am well pleased to see even the wicked compelled to do right. I heartily wish you success 
in your negotiation, and that whilst you secure one valuable point for us, (the fisheries.) you will not the less exert your endeavours for another very essential object, 
the free navigation of the Mississippi, provided guilty Britain should remain in possession of the Floridas. I 
totally despair of this navigation from any other advocation. Before this reaches <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> you will have heard of the arrival of the Count D'Estaign on our coasts. 
Should fortune favour us with this aid, we may hope to remove our unprincipled enemies from New York and Rhode Island. If, to this, we could add Nova Scotia, 
we might be pretty indifferent about the future movements of Great Britain. 
</p><p>
I shall be happy at all times to hear from you, and will in return furnish you with such intelligence as this part of the world produces. 
</p><p>
With singular esteem and affection, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, most sincerely yours, 
</p><p>
