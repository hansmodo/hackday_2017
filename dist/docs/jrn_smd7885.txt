Still floating about! This morning after breakfast, General Carter made his appearance, and in 
answer to his question as to whether we were ready to leave with him, Miriam replied, "Yes, indeed!" 
heartily, glad to get away from <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, where I 
have detained her ever since the day Theodore 
returned home, to her great disgust. As our trunk 
was already packed, it did not take many minutes 
to get ready ; and in a little while, with a protracted 
good-bye, we were on our way to the depot, which 
we reached some time before the cars started. 
Though glad to leave <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, I was sorry to part 
with mother. For ten days she has been unable to 
walk, with a sore on her leg below the knee; and I 
want to believe she will miss me while I am away. I 
could not leave my bird in that close, ill-ventilated 
house. He has never sung since I recovered him ; and 
I attribute his ill health or low spirits to that 
unhealthy place, and thought <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> might be 
beneficial to him, too; so brought him with me, to 
see what effect a breath of pure air might have.

We were the only ladies on the cars, except Mrs. Brown, who got off halfway; but in spite of that, 
had a very pleasant ride, as we had very agreeable 
company. The train only stopped thirteen times in 
the twenty miles. Five times to clear the brushwood 
from the telegraph lines, once running back a mile 
to pick up a passenger, and so on, to the great indignation of many of the passengers aboard, who would 
occasionally cry out, " Hello! if this is the clearing-up train, we had better send for a hand-car!" 
"What the devil's the matter now?" until the 
General gravely assured them that it was an old 
habit of this very accommodating train, which in 
summer-time stopped whenever the passengers 
wished to pick blackberries on the road.

Many soldiers were aboard on their way to Port Hudson, to rejoin their companies. One gallant one 
offered me a drink of water from his canteen, which I accepted out of mere curiosity to see what water 
from such a source tasted of. To my great surprise, I found it tasted just like any other. The General introduced a Mr. Crawford to us, who took the seat 
next to me, as the one next to Miriam was already occupied, and proved a very pleasant and talkative compagnon de voyage. General Carter's query as to 
my industry since he had seen me, brought my acknowledgment of having made two shirts, one of 
which I sent yesterday. Who to? was the next question. I gave the name, adding that I did not 
know the gentleman, and he was under the impression that it was made by mother. " I'll see that he is undeceived!" cried the General. "Hanged if I don't 
tell him!" "Thirtieth Louisiana, you say?" queried Mr. Crawford. "That is the very one I am going 
to! I will tell him myself!" So my two zealous champions went on, the General ending with "See 
to it, Crawford; Mrs. Morgan shall not have the credit!" as though there was any great merit in 
sewing for one's countrymen ! Our new acquaintance handed me from the cars as we reached <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a>, 
and stood talking while the accommodating train slowly rolled out its freight. He told me he was 
going to send me a tiny sack of coffee, which proposition, as it did not meet with the slightest encouragement, will of course never be thought of again.

I noticed, too, on the train, one of the Arkansas's 
crew. The same who, though scarcely able to stand 
on a severely wounded foot, made such a fuss about 
riding in a carriage while "real ladies" had to walk. 
Of course he did not recognize us, any more than we 
would have known him if Dr. Brown had not pointed 
him out. I hear all of them are at Port Hudson. 
Anna told me, as we got here, that Dr. Addison (the 
one I disliked because he was so scrupulously neat 
while the others were dressed, or rather undressed, 
for working) was here yesterday, and inquired for 
the Miss Morgans, saying they were the most charming young ladies he had ever met. On what he 
founded his opinion, or how he happened to inquire 
for us in this part of the country, I cannot imagine.

The General brings news of the boys from Jackson. He there met an officer who left <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Stonewall Jackson's</a> command on the 2d inst., and says Gibbes 
was unhurt, God be praised ! Another saw George a week ago in <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, still lame, as the cap of his knee had slipped in that fall last spring. Of Jimmy 
we hear not a word, not even as to where he is. It seems as though we are destined never to hear again.
