Dear Friend
</p><p>
   Your letter has been at
hand for some time and my excuse for not answering sooner is
that I have not felt stout enough
until now to undertake to write.
Since the time I last wrote you
I have been considerably under
the weather again.
</p><p>
   Your letter gave one great
satisfaction and was very interest
ing and would have been much
more so if you had given me a little
more local news. I am always
very anxious at all times to hear
how matters and things progress in
old Southampton.
</p><p>
   I shall have to make this letter
short as I cannot compose my mind to write and I am getting
nervous. Give Respects to friends
and write soon and the next time
I hope to be in a better condition
for answering.
</p><p>

Respectfully Yours
</p><p>
D.R.P. Shoemaker
