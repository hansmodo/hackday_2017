DEAR SIR, I thank you very sincerely for the readiness with 
which you have complied with my troublesome request on the 
subject of the Stamp act. I made it on a supposition that you 
had been present at the proceedings of the Virginia Assembly, 
which I find was not the case. But, knowing the accuracy and 
extent of your intelligence on all such interesting occurrences, 
I consider the particulars with which you have favored me as 
not the less authentic on that account. 
</p><p>
You were right in predicting that the assumption would not 
be abandoned as long as new shapes could be devised for the 
measure. I understand that the leading advocates persist in 
declarations of their hopes of final success, and that new experiments are in agitation. Since my last, a vote has passed by a 
large majority separating that part of the Secretary's plan from 
the provision for the federal debt, and bills have been ordered 
in for the latter alone. This will embarrass the efforts in favor 
of the assumption, but will not defeat it. if by any means a majority can be made up on that side. 
</p>
