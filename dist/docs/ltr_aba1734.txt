I DARE say, before this time you have interpreted the Northern Storm. If the presages chilled your blood, 
how must you be frozen and stiffened at the disgrace brought upon our arms ! l unless some warmer pas 
sion seize you, and anger and resentment fire your breast. How are all our vast magazines of cannon, 
powder, arms, clothing, provision, medicine, &c., to be restored to us? But, what is vastly more, how shall the disgrace be wiped away? How shall our 
lost honor be retrieved? The reports with regard to that fortress are very vague and uncertain. Some 
write from thence, that there was not force sufficient to defend it. Others say it might have stood a long 
siege. Some there are, who ought to know why and wherefore we have given away a place of such importance.

That the inquiry will be made, I make no doubt ; and, if cowardice, guilt, deceit, are found upon any 
one, howsoever high or exalted his station, may shame, reproach, infamy, hatred, and the execrations of the public, be his portion.

I would not be so narrow-minded, as to suppose, that there are not many men of all nations, possessed of honor, virtue, and integrity ; yet, it is to be 
lamented, that we have not men among ourselves, sufficiently qualified for war, to take upon them the most important command.

It was customary among the Carthaginians, to have a military school, in which the flower of their 
nobility, and those whose talents and ambition prompted them to aspire to the first dignities, learned 
the art of war. From among these, they selected all their general officers ; for, though they employed 
mercenary soldiers, they were too jealous and suspicious to employ foreign generals. Will a foreigner, 
whose interest is not naturally connected with ours (any otherwise than as the cause of liberty is the 
cause of all mankind), will he act with the same zeal, or expose himself to equal dangers, with the 
same resolution, for a republic of which he is not a member, as he would have done for his own native 
country? And can the people repose an equal confidence in them, even supposing them men of integrity and abilities, and that they meet with success equal to their abilities? How much envy and malice are employed against them ! And how galling to pride, how mortifying to human nature, to see itself excelled.

I have nothing new to entertain you with, unless it is an account of a new set of mobility, which has 
lately taken the lead in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. You must know that there is a great scarcity of sugar and coffee, 
articles which the female part of the state is very loth to give up, especially whilst they consider the 
scarcity occasioned by the merchants having secreted a large quantity. There had been much rout 
and noise in the town for several weeks. Some stores had been opened by a number of people, and 
the coffee and sugar carried into the market, and dealt out by pounds. It was rumored that an eminent, wealthy, stingy merchant (who is a bachelor) 
had a hogshead of coffee in his store, which he refused to sell to the committee under six shillings per 
pound. A number of females, some say a hundred, some say more, assembled with a cart and trucks, marched down to the warehouse, and demanded the 
keys, which he refused to deliver. Upon which, one of them seized him by his neck, and tossed him into 
the cart. Upon his finding no quarter, he delivered the keys, when they tipped up the cart and discharged him ; then opened the warehouse, hoisted out the coffee themselves, put it into the truck, and drove off.

It was reported, that he had personal chastisement among them ; but this, I believe, was not true. A 
large concourse of men stood amazed, silent spectators of the whole transaction.

Adieu. Your good mother is just come ; she desires to be remembered to you ; so do my father 
and sister, who have just left me, and so does she, whose greatest happiness consists in being tenderly 
beloved by her absent friend, and who subscribes herself ever his
