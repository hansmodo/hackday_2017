Dear Friend Henry:
</p><p>
   Your letter of the 6th inst. came
to hand in due course of mail, and the reason it
was not answered sooner was that I have been sick
since the 1st of the present month with what is here
called "Acclimating Fever." I am convalescent now,
but still quite weak, which must be my excuse for a
short letter.
</p><p>
   In fact there is little news to write. Morgan and
his ragamuffins have mostly left, and gone to the northeast. Our regiment is now out scouting.
</p><p>
    The change of climate and water is beginning to have
its effect on our boys and about 12 per cent are
on the Sick List. Intermittent Fever and Camp
Diarrhea, principally.
</p><p>
   My regards to all the friends. Write soon
and do not govern yourself by the length of this
letter.
</p><p>
Ever Your Friend
</p><p>
Shoemaker

To: H.A. Bitner Esq.

P.S.
I am getting very forgetful indeed, as I
almost forgot to ask you to present my Compli
ments to Miss Addie [unclear: Croplan] and the fair sex gen-
erally.
</p>
S.
