DID you ever receive a visit from St. Nicholas in your childhood? With what pleasure did you take down the little well-filled stocking, suspended by a fork at the ingle-side before daylight of a merry Christmas morning, and how your heart swelled with joy as you drew from the deep recess of knit woolen the treasures which the good Santa Claus had left in token of his kind remembrance.
</p><p>
It was a dark, gloomy day, and I was sitting somewhat moodily in my cloth-covered cabin, engaged in the pleasing, though somewhat aristocratic (à la California) occupation of baking the bread
which I had mixed up in the morning, when the curtain door of my log palace was suddenly drawn, and our mutual friend Dawly appeared, with a bundle of papers and a note from you which Captain Freeland had brought up from the city. Had old Santa Claus himself appeared with his precious gifts, I could not have been half so much gratified as the sight of that package from you afforded me, and I fear that some of my expressions savored more of childish delight than the calm pleasure of a man of forty You have been in the mountains, and know how isolated we are from the world, and particularly at this season of the year when all intercourse with below is nearly suspended, and we are left to seek amusement from our own reflection--you can well appreciate the pleasure with which I received your gift. The sight of a late newspaper is rare among us, and when one arrives in the mines it is read and reread, with all its advertisements even, and then it passes from hand to hand till little is left to entitle it to the distinction of being a newspaper. Suffice it then to say, that the package was most truly acceptable, and for which I thank you. When you next visit these diggings I shall be able to afford you something better for a breakfast than that of my self-praised battercake. I have made decided improvement in my culinary education since your sojourn with me at Mud Hill, having taken lessons from that old dame, Madame Necessity; and now, instead of confining my experiments in cooking to heavy griddle cakes, I have been elevated to the high dignity of breadbaker. I most truly hope to be able to give you specimens of my proficiency, at my cabin the coming spring.

I remained mudbound at my quarters at the hill for three weeks, enjoying the magnificent scenery of Table Mountain, which was occasionally peeping out of a cloud of fog, or taking a shower bath for days together, as if to drive away the chills and fever of this accursed climate by hydropathy, when at length, between a race of the sun struggling to shine and the rain to PUT HIM OUT, the road became solid enough to keep my cattle from sinking lower down than their bellies in mud, and I availed myself of the opportunity to get through, in which I succeeded by holding my breath and driving two days to get ten miles. Trouble of conscience for ever leaving home and coming to this delightful and Bryant-praised Valley, or something else, produced a severe attack of neuralgia, and I was confined to my bed for three weeks, when I had ample time to
groan from intense pain and study patience in all sorts of the most approved styles. On my recovery, for it is a fact that I did not die, I projected a prospecting tour up the South Fork in search of gold and for the purpose of more fully re-establishing my health. A party of nine was organized, it being dangerous to go with less on account of the hostility of the Indians, and in order to give weight to our enterprise we carried our blankets, five days' rations, making our packs about thirty pounds each, besides our prospecting tools, rifles and ammunition. We left in buoyant spirits--in fact we were soon convinced that high as our hopes were, we were rising in the world, and at every step became more and more elevated, for such infernal hills and mountains as we passed over--but you have been on the South Fork; you did not carry our packs, though.

No need of mules here any longer, for after the first day we all became as mulish as the d--l could desire. We were gone just a week and penetrated the snow above the cañon, but in return were penetrated with the frost and cold of the high peaks, while the rain sought shelter in our bosoms, on the lower grounds, for it rained every day and night but one while we were gone, and we looked more like drowned rats than gentlemen gold-seekers. Strange to say, we did not even take a cold, and I gained in strength every day, although wet to the skin all the while. No doubt we should have been drowned were it not for the large quantities of raw, fat, salt pork which we ate. Like the ark, we were pitched within and without. And where was our gold?--echo answers, where! I did not see any, but I saw many places where it ought to be--my pocket, for instance.
</p><p>
We were fortunate enough, however, to secure a bar, and we are making preparations for removing there as soon as possible. We made some discoveries, too, which may be valuable. Our location is at Wood's Bar, about four or five miles below the Cañon, where you will find us.

With regard to "Notes on California," I will comply with your request with pleasure, and will embrace my first leisure to write a "plain, unvarnished tale" of things as I see them. Most of the people who were here in the fall have gone and are going above, and we have nearly a deserted village.
