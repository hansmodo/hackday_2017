<p></p>
DEAR SIR: 
<p></p>
Hoping that in a day or two the new President 
will have happily passed through all personal danger, 
and find himself installed an honored successor of the 
great <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, with you as the chief of his Cabinet 
I beg leave to repeat in writing what I have before 
said to you orally this Supplement to my printed 
u Views " (dated in October last) on the highly disordered condition of our (so late) happy and glorious 
Union. 
<p></p>
To meet the extraordinary exigencies of the times, 
it seems to me that I am guilty of no arrogance in limiting the President's field of selection to one of the 
four plans of procedure subjoined : 
<p></p>
I. Throw off the old and assume a new designation 
the Union Party ; adopt the conciliatory measures 
proposed by Mr. Crittenden or the Peace Convention, 
and, my life upon it, we shall have no new case of 
Secession; but on the contrary, an early return of 
many, if not of all the States which have already 
broken off from the Union. Without some equally 
benign measure, the remaining slaveholding States 
will probably join the Montgomery Confederacy in 
less than sixty days when this city, being included 
in a foreign country, would require a permanent garrison of at least thirty-five thousand troops, to protect 
the Government within it. 
<p></p>
II. Collect the duties on foreign goods outside the 
ports of which this Government has lost the command, 
or close such ports by act of Congress, and blockade 
them. 
<p></p>
III. Conquer the seceded States by invading armies. 
No doubt this might be done in two or three years, by 
a young and able general a Wolfe a Desaix, or a 
Hoche, with three hundred thousand disciplined men 
[kept up to that number], estimating a third for garrisons, and the loss of a yet greater number by 
skirmishes, sieges, battles, and Southern fevers. The 
destruction of life and property on the other side 
would be frightful however perfect the moral discipline of the invaders. The conquest completed, at 
that enormous waste of human life to the North and 
Northwest, with at least $250,000,000 added thereto, 
and Cui l)onof Fifteen devastated Provinces! not 
to be brought into harmony with their conquerors; 
but to be held for generations by heavy garrisons, at 
an expense quadruple the net duties or taxes which it 
would be possible to extort from them, followed by a 
Protector or an Emperor. 
<p></p>
IV. Say to the seceded States Wayward Sisters, 
depart in peace ! 
<p></p>
In haste, I remain, 
<p></p>
Yery truly yours, 
<p></p>

HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
