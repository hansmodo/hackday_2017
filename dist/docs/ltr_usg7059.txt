MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, 
</p><p>
General-in-Chief, Washington: 
</p><p>
GENERAL, I have got General Thomas ready to move a force of about fourteen thousand infantry into East Tennessee to aid the 
force there in expelling <a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel='colleague adversary met'>Longstreet</a> from the State. He would have started on Monday night if I had not revoked the order. 
My reasons for doing this are these : General Foster, who is now here (or left this morning), says that our possession of the portion 
of East Tennessee is perfectly secure against all danger. The condition of the people within the rebel lines cannot be improved 
now after losing all they had. <a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel='colleague adversary met'>Longstreet</a>, where he is, makes more secure other parts of our possessions. Our men, from scanty 
clothing and short rations, are not in good condition for an advance. There are but very few animals in East Tennessee in 
condition to move artillery or other stores. If we move against <a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel='colleague adversary met'>Longstreet</a> with an overwhelming force he will simply fall back 
towards Virginia until he can be reinforced or take up an impregnable position. The country being exhausted, all our sup 
plies will have to be carried from Knoxville the whole distance advanced. We would be obliged to advance rapidly and return 
soon whether the object of the expedition was accomplished or not. <a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel='colleague adversary met'>Longstreet</a> could return with impunity on the heels of our 
returning column, at least as far down the valley as he can supply himself from the road in his rear. <a href='/results.php?tla=jms' rel='co-worker'>Schofield</a> telegraphs to the 
same effect. All these seem to be good reasons for abandoning the movement, and I have therefore suspended it. Now that our 
men are ready for an advance, however, I have directed it to be made on Dalton, and hope to get possession of that place and hold 
it as a step towards a spring campaign. Our troops in East Tennessee are now clothed ; rations are also accumulating. When 
Foster left most of the troops had ten days supplies, with five hundred barrels of flour and forty days meat in store, and the 
quantity increasing daily.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
U. S. GRANT, 
</p><p>
Major- General.
