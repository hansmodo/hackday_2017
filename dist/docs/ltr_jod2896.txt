FELL's point, which I mentioned in a letter this morning, has a considerable number of houses upon it. 
The shipping all lies now at this point. You have from it on one side a complete view of the harbor, 
and on the other a fine prospect of the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. You see the hill in full view and the court 
house, the church and meeting house upon it. The court house makes a haughty appearance from this 
point. There is a fortification erected on this point, with a number of embrasures for cannon facing the Narrows which make the entrance into the harbor. 
At the Narrows they have a fort with a garrison in it. It is now a month and a few days since I left you. I have heard nothing from you nor received a letter 
from the Massachusetts. I hope the post office will perform better than it has done. I am anxious to hear how you do. My duty to your papa and my 
mother. Love to brothers and sisters. Tell Betsey I hope she is married, though I want to throw the stocking. My respects to Mr. Shaw. Tell him he may 
be a Calvinist if he will, provided always, that he preserves his candor, charity and moderation. What shall I say of or to my children ? "What will they say 
to me for leaving them, their education and fortune so much to the disposal of chance ? May Almighty 
and all gracious providence protect and bless them ! I have this day sent my resignation of a certain mighty office. I It has relieved me from a burden 
which has a long time oppressed me. But I am determined that while I am ruining my constitution of 
mind and body, and running daily risks of my life and fortune in defence of the independence of my country, I will not knowingly resign my own.
