We have been blessed with contrary winds. On Monday we made but ten miles on our course. There was a splendid circle, brilliant as the rainbow, round the sun. With a light head wind, we were going northwest instead of south, but thanks to fortune the wind changed to a more favorable direction and we are now making very near our proper course, southwest. We had heavy rain during the day and caught several hogsheads of water. I did my washing in rainwater and found it much better than salt water. Two flying fish were found dead in the forecastle this morning. They are small, of a bluish color, small scales, but two fins. They are large near the head and have very large eyes. Also we saw a flock of spear-water, a species of gull.

Notwithstanding our nearness to the Equator, this has been the coldest day we have experienced since leaving port. Indeed it is so cold that many have brought out their overcoats, and they are quite comfortable. We now have bid farewell to many of the stars visible at home, among others the North Star. The "pointers" can be seen early in the evenings. They soon disappear below the horizon but we are repaid for the absence of these by the appearance of others not visible in our northern latitude.

I have just witnessed a somewhat novel sightfour of the passengers playing euchre with dominoes by moonlight. I sold a quart of brandy for $1.50. Some cheese and a cup belonging to Mr. Sterling are missing. The cup is said to be in the possession of one of the sailors. I have been seasick again and suffered severely from headache today. We had fresh bread for breakfast. It is promised twice a week hereafter.
