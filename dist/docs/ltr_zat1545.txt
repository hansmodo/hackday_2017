My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your several letters of the 9th & 12th  ins r were duly rec d the men 
referred to as necessary for Hospital purpose have been detailed & 
announced in orders. The case of Kelly was promptly attended to on 
the receipt of your first communication on the subject ; being referred to 
the Adj t Gen of the army, with an urgent request that if nothing could 
be done for him without, that the matter be brought before congress 
L { Eaton forwarded Miller a letter of recommendation to the Adj c Gen 
on the subject of Bealls leaving, I consider it was improper he should 
have done so under the circumstances, at any rate until another pay 
master relieved him ; he however is of but little account ; I look on him 
as pretty much broken down, at any rate whenever seperated from his 
family or rather wife ; I am fully aware of the difficulties you have to 
contend with, in the way of giving or withholding where officers are concerned, sick certificates 
</p><p>
I truly regret to hear that the Gov r Continues so seriously indisposed ; it is quite likely a trip from Fort Polk by water to this place, in 
addition to change of diet, may prove beneficial to him, at any rate I 
hope so The irregularity as well as the long intervals between the 
mails from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> have become a serious evil, if not an abuse ; we 
have had but one mail for the last 36 days ; I know of but one way to 
correct the same, which is to remove Q r Masters not from one station to 
another, but to civil life. I was pleased to hear that Col Mclntosh had 
taken his departure for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, and his doing so must be a great 
relief to the Medical dep 1 
</p><p>
I am thankful to Cap c Ramsey for his kind remembrance which is 
fully reciprocated ; if the report be true, that a compy of artillery had 
been sent by water to Callifornia, we may abandon all expectation of a 
peace with Mexico in any reasonable time ; & we will be fortunate if the 
result is not a war with some of the great European powers. Alth there 
appears to be a fatality attending every thing connected with the Q r M. 
department from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, yet I trust the steamer 
reported to have left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> with a mail is safe, at any rate the wag 
gons throw over board will never be recovered, & must be replaced if at 
all, by others which will have to be made ; so that I have abandoned all 
hopes of getting supplies to Cormargo which will enable me to make a 
forward movement in any reasonable time, so that the campaign in question must prove a failure in part, if not entirely ; the result will be, that I 
must be sacrificed, by the folly & imbecility of others I presume 
Col Taylor will be out in the Alabama, & will I make no doubt give you 
some pleasant news in regard to your family, a well as matters of interest 
going on about Washington The Rio Grande is rapidly falling & I 
presume the road between this & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a> will be passable in a few 
days, if it is not very good 
</p><p>
Col Whiting did not visit Fort Polk as I expected he would have 
done when he went to the mouth of the river a short time since, but presume he will attend to all the suggestions made by you in regard to wood 
& every thing else connected with the Hospital ; if not very energetic he 
appears to be a very gentlemanly person, & I have no doubt disposed to 
do what is right & proper. Majr Brown 1 who I learn is a man of 
energy, will be left in command of Fort Polk with his strong company ; 
removing all the militia from there. Cap 1 Vinton s 2 company got here 
last evening I hope the country will be in such a situation as to enable 
me to move foot & mounted troops in any direction in 6 or 8 days ; with 
loaded waggons it is doubtful when I can do so As to Ann s change 
of location, that of course must be left to future events, at any rate in a 
great measure ; I hope you will be able to attend to her removal to some 
more desirable position in person in October. At any rate if in com 
mand here I calculate on giving you a leave for that object in October 
</p><p>
There is so many applicants for situations in the staff, I feel no wish 
for Dick to take any situation of the kind, & prefer his continuing with 
me, even if unemployed rather than to be the subject of remarks by any 
one, alth idleness is here & everywhere else a growing evil ; I have not 
as yet made up my mind as to the occupation in life it would be best 
for him to adopt or pursue. I sincerely hope there will be no necessity 
for the app 1 of any additional Gen officers by the president under the 
recent law for that object, nor even if done, would I regret or feel out 
raged if the appt was given to an other, I am too far advanced in life to 
be able much longer to discharge the duties appertaining to that station 
Gen Jesup 1 may receive the app 1 in question, but I hardly think not, 
but should he not do so, he will hardly throw away his bread and butter, 
by resigning I feel confident that our ambitious views of conquest & 
agrandisement at the expense of a weak power will only be restrained & 
circumscribed by our inability to carry out our view, & in six or eight 
months if the Mexicans hold out that long, we will be fully as anxious 
to make peace as they are ; for by that time we will have expended with 
very little effect or purpose all the money in the treasury, when our gov c 
will have to resort to loans & taxation to carry on the war ; a course 
never palatable to our people We have nothing of interest here I 
send you down a map of Mexico no very correct one, but the best we 
have I was gratified to learn your health was tolerable, & hope it 
will get no worse if it does not improve, but hope the latter will be the 
case. I hope the next mail will bring you good news from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> 
Give my love to Ann & the children when you write them My 
respects to Ramsey & Dr. Wells & wishing you continued health I 
remain with respect & esteem

Your pay accts with your note was turned over to Denny who 
promised the matter should be attended to the mail is just in but brings 
nothing of importance, I have rec d my com" as Majr Gen so that I may 
dispense for the future with my Brevt. in signing my name officially

I had nearly finished my letter to you when the mail man left with 
out my knowing it ; the fact is the only time I have to write or in fact to 
attend to any private business, is from day light to breakfast, the balance 
of my time is completely occupied with public & other matters. My 
eyes will not admit or permit my writing by candle light. 
</p><p>
The mail man come in the morning & brought a good many letters, 
but nothing of importance Nothing from the Alabama I feel very 
uneasy about ner, but hope she has run back to Galveston, or got into 
some other safe harbor, we shall know all about her in a day or two. 
</p><p>
Yours truly
