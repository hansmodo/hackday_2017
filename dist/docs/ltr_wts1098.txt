My Dear Brother: . . . We are here perfectly 
banished. Occasionally a vessel comes up from the 
Sandwich Islands and other parts in the Pacific, but now 
that the first excitement has worn off, California is fast 
settling into its original and deserved obscurity. Military law is supreme here, and the way we ride down the 
few lawyers who have ventured to come here is curious. 
We have no courts here but the Alcalde Courts, and no 
laws save the Articles of War and the Regulations of 
Police, and yet a more quiet community could not exist. 
The lawyers are rampant; they came here to make 
money, and there are no courts, and the Governor won't 
make any, because the coming of lawyers to California is 
a bad omen. . . . 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother,
