MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I MUST remain here, because my friends say I must 
not go. Those whose principles are the same with 
mine, whose views of public good coincide with mine, 
say that if we keep together, we shall succeed to the 
end of the session as we have hitherto done, in keeping off all the most pernicious projects. 
</p><p>
The ways and means before the House of Representatives is a very important and a very difficult system. 
While I confess the necessity of it, and see its importance in giving strength to our government at 
home and consideration to our country abroad, I lament the introduction of taxes and expenses which 
will accumulate a perpetual debt and lead to future 
revolutions. 
</p><p>
I regret every moment I lose here, but I cannot 
yet be sure that I can see you before June. 
</p><p>
With the utmost tenderness of affection, 
</p><p>
