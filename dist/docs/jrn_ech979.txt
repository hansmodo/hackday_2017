We have crossed the Tropic of Capricorn. The sea has been exceedingly rough and I have not felt like writing. The way the vessel rocked from side to side and rattled the dishes and trunks was a caution to Davy Crockett. It has been impossible for many of the passengers to sleep as we were one moment with the feet up and the next with the head. All kinds of furniture in the cabin were being dashed and rolled about in beautiful style. The wind increased until it blew quite a gale, howling and whistling through the rigging as on a bleak December morning. The ocean roared and dashed as though the Furies were waked up within her, yet our good old ship glided over it like the swift courser over the smooth and level surface. We find our cabin very comfortable, much more so than the upper one, and now during the evening our table is crowded by readers and card players. Our thickest woolens are in requisition. Two vessels came near us, but owing to the roughness of the sea, we could hold no communication with them. We signalled them, however, and as they displayed the Spanish flag, a yellow strip with one of red on each side, we supposed them from the Mediterranean bound to Rio de Janeiro.

Early this morning it commenced raining very hard and the storm continued with great violence. The waves piled mountain high, rocking the vessel so as to make it very difficult to stand on deck, and ever anon dashing over her sides, completely deluging her. About supper time a very heavy sea struck her, emptied the tables of their furniture and started nearly every trunk in our cabin rolling as if life were quickly instilled into it. Mr. Devine was thrown on deck and, in falling, caught hold of the binnacle, tearing it away and breaking the oval glass and the compass, but fortunately without hurting himself.

Some days since, scores of whale birds presented themselves and remained during the day. We caught over a dozen. They are of a dark color, about three feet from tip of wing to tip, have a white ring round neck and eye, crooked bill, toes united in a web, with claws at the end of each. They alight in the water and swim and dive like ducks. They live on fish and whatever they can catch. It was quite a novel idea to us land-lubbers to see them alight near the vessel and pick the baited hook, and then be hauled up on deck. It is singular that they cannot rise up off the deck and fly away. All the old seamen told us they were unfit for use, notwithstanding which we had them cooked and found them to be quite palatable.

This afternoon after the rain had ceased, birds being still quite numerous around us, the passengers took out their lines and were successful in taking a gony, a species of duck, perfectly white except over the back and wings, and measuring over six feet across the wings. The gony was skinned for the purpose of preserving the pelt with the down on. Being pronounced unfit to eat, the body was quartered and given to the pigs. Mr.

Doyle caught a mammoth goose which Mrs. Doyle had picked, and as it was covered with a splendid coat of white down, had the skin preserved for making a tippet. The skin is preserved by stretching tightly over a board and washing it with strong alum water. I rigged a fish line and after bobbing a long while was successful in taking a Cape pigeon, which later was let loose. It resembled our common pigeon very much except that it is colored like the woodcock, with webbed feet.

Clint and I did our washing today and a hard job it was. I rubbed the "bark" off my fingers. We expect that it will be too cold to wash again until we reach Valparaiso. Dick and Mack were drunk this afternoon. They each lost a hat. This evening a court was established and the case of C. Yard vs. Jeremiah, alias Jas. A. Rogers, came up for trial. The defendant was charged with wrongly taking Mr. Yard's stool out of his berth, thereby endangering a certain glass case. Judge Price presided and there was much merriment over the occasion. Tomorrow evening was appointed for the trial of Messrs. Hathaway vs. Mr. Devine, on account of breaking the binnacle, compass, etc. Several other cases are on hand, but whether or not they will ever be tried, deponent cannot say.
(Among our passengers is a couple just married before leaving port, Mr. and Mrs. Bates. It is a significant fact that she is now manufacturing little clothes!)
