Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 30th January last, I had the pleasure of receiving vour very acceptable letter of the 12th October, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 
The able manner in which it treats the important subject of 
American finances induced me to give that part of it to the 
minister, and to send a copy of the same extract to Dr. 
Franklin, who, in his answer, says - "I thank you for communicating to me the letter of the secretary of Congress on 
our finances. It gives light which I had not before, and 
may be useful here." 
</p><p>
I wish in my heart that you was not only secretary of 
Congress, but secretary also for foreign affairs. I should 
then have better sources of intelligence than gazettes and 
reports. 
</p><p>
My public letter contains a state of our affairs here. I 
flatter myself that Congress will never again attempt to 
form an alliance on principles of equality in forma pauperis. 
</p><p>
Before their ingenious letter on our right to the Mississippi arrived, it was known in Europe ; and the subject of 
my last instructions on that head was no secret here before they reached this side of the ocean. I would tell you more, 
had I now time to write in ciphers ; but the gentleman who sis to carry these despatches is waiting for them. 
</p><p>
The want of a regular and safe communication between 
Congress and their foreign ministers gives occasion to 
various inconveniences. Every letter known or suspected 
to be for or from me, that gets into the post-offices, is 
opened, often kept back for a while, and, to my certain 
knowledge, sometimes suppressed entirely. 
</p><p>
Hence it happens that Congress receives from me fewer 
letters than I could wish, or than their affairs may demand. 
The expense of private couriers is intolerable, nor can many 
in that character be found who merit confidence. 
</p><p>
The unseasonable arrival of bills, without being preceded 
by funds, and the train of perplexing consequences resulting 
from that and other causes not in my power to prevent, 
have given me some anxious hours, and often rendered my 
situation uneasy. 
It is my business, however, to reflect, that pleasure was 
not the object for which I came here, and that obstacles 
should rather excite than repress perseverance. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present Mrs. Jay's and my compliments 
to Mrs. Thompson, and believe me to be with sincere 
regard and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
