My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>:  I received last night your letter of the 2d, and would
have answered it at once, but was detained with the Secretary till
after 11 P. M.  I fear now I may miss the mail.  Saturday evening I
tried to get down to you to spend Sunday, but could find no government
boat going down, and the passenger boats all go in the morning.  I
then went to the stable and got out my horse, but it was near night
then and I was ignorant both of the road and distance and I gave it
up.  I was obliged to be here Monday, and as it would have consumed
all Sunday to go and come, I have remained for better times.  The
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed" rel="colleague met">President</a> said I could not go to-day, so I must see what can be done
to-morrow.  I will come, however, wherever you are, either Shirley
or the White House, as soon as possible, and if not sooner, Saturday
at all events....  I am, as ever, Yours,
</p>
