Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received duly and in good order the several letters 
you have written to me of August 16th, 19th, September 
8th, and 22d. The papers that accompanied them of your 
writing gave me the pleasure of seeing the affairs of our 
country in such good hands, and the prospect, from your 
youth, of its having the service of so able a minister for a great number of years. But the little success that has 
attended your late applications for money mortified me 
exceedingly ; and the storm of bills which I found coming 
upon us both, has terrified and vexed me to such a degree 
that I have been deprived of sleep, and so much indisposed 
by continual anxiety, as to be rendered almost incapable of writing. 
</p><p>
At length I got over a reluctance that was almost invincible, and made another application to the government 
here for more money. I drew up and presented a state of 
debts and newly-expected demands, and requested its aid 
to extricate me. Judging from your letters that you were 
not likely to obtain any thing considerable from your court, 
I put down in my estimate the 25,000 dollars drawn upon 
you, with the same sum drawn upon me, as what would 
probably come to me for payment. I have now the pleasure to acquaint you that my memorial was received in the 
kindest and most friendly manner, and though the court 
here is not without its embarrassments on account of 
money, I was told to make myself easy, for that I should 
be assisted with what was necessary. Mr. Searle arriving 
about this time, and assuring me there had been a plentiful 
harvest, and great crops of all kinds ; that the Congress 
had demanded of the several States contributions in produce, which would be cheerfully given ; that they would 
therefore have plenty of provisions to dispose of; and I 
being much pleased with the generous behaviour just experienced, I presented another paper, proposing, in order 
to ease the government here, which had been so willing to 
ease us, that the Congress might furnish their army in 
America with provisions in part of payment for the services lent us. This proposition, I was told, was well 
taken ; but it being considered that the States having the 
enemy in their country, and obliged to make great expenses 
for the present campaign, the furnishing so much provisions 
as the French army might need, might straiten and be 
inconvenient to the Congress, his majesty did not at this 
time think it right to accept the offer. You will not 
wonder at my loving this good prince : he will win the 
hearts of all America. 
</p><p>
If you are not so fortunate in Spain, continue however 
the even good temper you have hitherto manifested. 
Spain owes us nothing ; therefore, whatever friendship she 
shows us in lending money or furnishing clothes, &c. 
though not equal to our wants and wishes, is however tant de gagne ; those who have begun to assist us, are more 
likely to continue than to decline, and we are still so much 
obliged as their aids amount to. But I hope and am confident, that court will be wiser than to take advantage of 
our distress, and insist on our making sacrifices by an 
agreement, which the circumstances of such distress would 
hereafter weaken, and the very proposition can only give 
disgust at present. Poor as we are, yet as I know wc 
shall be rich, I would rather agree with them to buy at a 
great price the whole of their right on the Mississippi, 
than sell a drop of its waters. A neighbour might as well 
ask me to sell my street door. 
</p><p>
I wish you could obtain an account of what they have 
supplied us with already in money and goods. 
</p><p>
Mr. Grand, informing me that one of the bills drawn on 
you having been sent from hence to Madrid, was come 
back unaccepted, I have directed him to pay it ; and he has, at my request, undertaken to write to the Marquis D'Yranda, to assist you with money to answer such bills 
as you are not otherwise enabled to pay, and to draw on 
him for the amount, which drafts I shall answer here as far 
as 25,000 dollars. If you expect more, acquaint me. But 
pray write to Congress as I do, to forbear this practice, 
which is so extremely hazardous, and may, some time or 
other, prove very mischievous to their credit and affairs. 
I have undertaken, too, for all the bills drawn on <a href='/results.php?tla=hel' rel='colleague'>Mr. Laurens</a>, that have yet appeared. He was to have sailed 
three days after Mr. Searle, that is, the 18th July. Mr. Searle begins to be in pain for him, having no good opinion 
of the little vessel he was to embark in. 
</p><p>
We have letters from America to the 7th August. The 
spirit of our people was never higher. Vast exertions 
making preparatory for some important action. Great 
harmony and affection between the troops of the two nations. The new money in good credit, &c. 
</p><p>
I will write to you again shortly, and to Mr. Carmichael. 
I shall now be able to pay up your salaries complete for the 
year ; but as demands unforeseen are continually coming 
upon me, I still retain the expectations you have given me 
of being reimbursed out of the first remittances you 
receive. 
</p><p>
If you find any inclination to hug me for the good news 
of this letter, I constitute and appoint Mrs. Jay my attorney, 
to receive in my behalf your embraces. With great and sincere esteem, 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant,
