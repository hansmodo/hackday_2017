DEAR SIR : Your very interesting letter of the 21st of December, arrived here just after I had passed through 
this city on my way to South Carolina, and was not received until about two months after its date : the subject of it has since that time been daily in my mind. 
Independently of considerations personal to myself, I learn with the utmost pleasure that you are to be restored 
to the social and the active world. Your talents and acquirements seem to have destined you for something 
more than vegetable life, and since the first hour of our acquaintance, I have considered your seclusion as a fraud on society. 
</p><p>
The confidence you have been pleased to place in me is extremely flattering, and it would seem that there has 
been, without explanation, a sort of consent between our minds. In a matter of so much moment, and on which I 
am so imperfectly informed, it would be hazarding too much to offer advice ; yet it is due to the frankness of 
your letter, to acknowledge that I had projected, and still meditate, a speculation, precisely of the character you 
have described. It would have been submitted to your consideration in October last, if I had then the good for 
tune to find you at home. The business, however, depends, in some degree, on contingencies, not within 
my control, and will not be commenced before December or January, if ever. From this circumstance, and as the 
matter, in its present state, can not be satisfactorily explained by letter, the communication will be deferred 
until a personal interview can be had. With this view I pray to be informed of your intended movements the 
ensuing season, and in case you should visit Orleans, at what time, and at what port you may be expected on the 
Atlantic coast. But I must insist that these intimations be not permitted to interrupt the prosecution of any 
plans which you have formed for yourself no occupation which shall not take you off the continent can interfere 
with that which I may propose. You would certainly be pleased, probably charmed, with the manners and the 
society of Orleans. As a place of business, too, it offers great advantages ; most of those who style themselves 
lawyers, are become visionary speculators, or political fanatics. Mr. Brown, by avoiding these follies, has in 
spired confidence, and is growing rich. The country is deficient in the means of education, and the climate is 
thought, I believe with reason, unfriendly to children.

"We shall have no war unless we should be actually invaded. Some estimate of the views and temper of our 
Government may be formed from the proceedings of the House of Representatives, with closed doors. A copy of 
that part of their journal is sent for your amusement. 
</p><p>
Accept, dear sir, assurances of the great consideration and respect with which I am, 
</p><p>
Yours obediently, <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
