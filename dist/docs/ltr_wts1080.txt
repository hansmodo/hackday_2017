Dear Brother: I did go to the salt works, as I proposed when you were at home, and was there three 
or four days. While there I made arrangements to 
go with the Misses Clark to a relative of theirs (Mr. 
Walker), from thence to Beverly; but unfortunately it 
rained, and we got several duckings before we got to 
Mr. W.'s (twelve miles), and when there was told it 
was thirty miles farther. Consequently I was obliged, 
much against my wish, to relinquish my design of visiting you. After a few days' stay at the salt works, we 
returned to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lancaster" rel="city">Lancaster</a>. When I had been home a few 
days grandma and Taylor came down from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a> 
on the way to Dayton. Mother, Lamp, and I accompanied them, and had a very fine trip. Lamp and I went 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=oxford" rel="city">Oxford</a> College to see Phil, 3 from there to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, 
where I stayed a couple of days, then returned to Dayton, 
where I found them all ready to return home. We travelled together until we got to Columbus, where we found 
Mr. Ewing. Mother and the rest went on home. Phil 
and I remained until the next day, and then went home 
in the carriage. My furlough had nearly expired, and 
I could only stay home two days more, at the end of 
which time James, 4 grandma, and I went to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a>, 
where we found them all well except Mr. Parker, who 
was not very well. We stopped at Mary's and Uncle 
John's a few minutes on our way up. From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a> I 
went with Taylor in his buggy to Sandusky on the lake. 
We stopped all night at Uncle Daniel's, whom I saw for 
the first time. He is a very fine old man, but I do not 
think he resembles father (if you recollect him). From 
Sandusky I went to Buffalo by water, then to Niagara 
Falls, thence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> City, where I spent two days 
with our relatives, then to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=west point" rel="city">West Point</a>, where I have 
been a little more than two weeks studying very hard 
indeed.

Your affectionate brother,
