DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Three months have elapsed since my return to this town. 
My health has been restored beyond my expectations, and 
I have been able without injuring it, to devote a larger 
portion of my time to study than I hoped to when I left 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>. Lord Coke, Saunders, Hale and Blackstone 
have contributed to add to my small stock of professional 
knowledge, and I have made some researches into the 
doctrine of pleading. My greatest apprehensions at present 
are with respect to the practical part of the profession. 
The skill to apply general knowledge to particular cases is 
no less important than the knowledge itself; and a new 
piece of mechanism will often perform its operations with 
great irregularity, however well it may be constructed. I 
remain still in a state of irresolution and suspense with 
respect to the place of my future residence. I have consulted Mr. Parsons upon the subject : he said he could 
not advise me so well at present, as he might after the 
federal judiciary system shall be established, because he 
knew not what vacancies might be created by that circumstance. He however hinted that if either himself or 
Mr. Bradbury should be removed he should recommend this place to me. I know not what his own expectations 
are; but I have some reason to suppose he has his eye upon two offices, those of the district judge and Attorney 
General, either of which I believe would suit him well. 
And by his putting the supposition of his being taken off from the practice, I have conjectured that there was in his 
own mind an idea of the probability of his appointment. As I believe his talents are much better calculated to administer laws than to make them, I wish he may succeed. 
Perhaps even an involuntary consideration of my own 
interest has some effect to give a bias to my opinion. I am 
the more free to make this confession, because I suppose 
the appointments are all adjusted ere this and I shall not 
therefore appear in the humiliating light of a solicitor, 
which I wish ever to avoid, and in which I am well persuaded I should be unsuccessful were I now to assume it. 
</p><p>
As our newspapers are probably transmitted to you with regularity, I can give you very little news in the public 
line. The very great majority of votes by which Mr. H[ancock] was reelected, and the influence which was 
successfully exerted for Mr. A[dams], appeared somewhat singular after the event of all the contests relating to the 
federal elections. There have been a variety of subordinate political manoeuvres in the choice of representatives 
of the different towns. Those in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> you have undoubtedly been informed of. There was in this town a 
faint struggle for a change in the representation, but the old members came in with a respectable majority. 
</p><p>
Our General Court, after sitting about a month, and 
busying themselves upon the subject of finance just sufficient to refer it over to the next session, have adjourned to 
some time in January, when it will be too late in the political year to adopt any decisive measures. There has 
been a scheme on foot for sinking our State debt by means of a lottery. From Mr. Parsons's conversation I have 
supposed that the plan originated with him, and in his speculative principles he thinks it would reconcile the 
claims of public justice with the interests of an impotent debtor. The proposal was to redeem 40,000 of the debt 
by refunding only 10,000 in specie to the adventurers. 
Besides the impropriety of encouraging a gambling disposition among the people, I confess the plan appears to 
me equally inconsistent with the dignity of a sovereign 
state and with the integrity of an honest debtor. For 
whatever expedients may be used to conceal or disguise 
the iniquity of the transaction, nothing can be more clear 
than that where a debt of 40,000 is paid with 10,000 the 
creditor must be defrauded. The bill passed in the House 
by a majority of 73 to 52, but was non-concurred by the 
Senate.
</p><p>
The proceedings of Congress have almost entirely superseded all other subjects of political speculation. The 
revenue bill has hitherto chiefly engaged the public attention. The original duty upon molasses exceedingly alarmed 
many of our West India merchants, and whatever may be 
said of discarding all local and personal considerations, they have not, I believe, been so much pleased with any act of 
the President of the Senate, as his turning the vote for 
reducing the duty to three cents. This observation how 
ever only applies to a few, for I do not know that the circumstance is generally known. The judiciary bill has not 
yet been published here. I had a transient sight of a copy, 
which I believe Mr. Dalton sent. Mr. Parsons thinks six 
judges will not be enough, and objects to the joining the 
district judge to the other two in the circuits, because it 
gives him a casting voice in affirming his own decisions. 
I am, etc.
