My Dearest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--I have read and reread your truly welcome letter of November 20th. I am indeed glad my letters, poor as they are, afford you some pleasant thoughts when you feel gloomy and low spirited.
</p><p>
You still talk of remaining another year. I hope it will be all talk and you will change your mind and return next fall. I don't want to influence you to do anything that you will regret afterwards, but I don't feel as if I could advise you to stay another year.

A majority of the West Chester Californians yet living have returned. They seem to be perfectly satisfied with their California experience and have no disposition to try gold digging again. None of them have amassed very large piles of gold.

I went up the street the other day and I saw Dr.
Williams' wife and she said, <q>I heard that Mr. Christman was coming home in April.</q> I said to her, <q>You heard more than he or I know.</q> Oh, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, if that were only true how happy I would be!
</p><p>
I have received two papers. I tell you, it made me look when I saw <q>E. L. Christman and L. C. Gunn, Editors and Proprietors.</q> Then I received the paper containing the advertisement of your having bought one-half of the Sonora Herald. Eagerly did I read it.
</p><p>
You speak the truth when you say I love you for yourself, and not for wealth. I would love you as devotedly without a dollar as if you had thousands. At the same time I hope you will make money, for you have sacrificed much and made great efforts to make money, and I would like you to feel well repaid for your trouble. However, I think you have acted wisely and I know you are doing all for the best.

The trial of George Pharoah was concluded on the 12th of February and on the 13th Judge Chapman passed the sentence of death upon him. Father called on him the same day and said to him, <q>George, the trial is over and your fate is sealed. It would be a great relief to many, particularly to the jury, to know the facts of the murder from you. The testimony brought against you is true and all you can say will not make it any worse for you.</q> After a little hesitation, he made a full confession. He said he shot the teacher for her watch, and the reason he did not take it was because he saw the school children coming at a short distance. In speaking of the gun wadding corresponding with the paper in his pocket he said he intended burning it, but when he returned to the house, some persons were there, and he afterward forgot it. There never was so much excitement in West Chester
as there was when the trial was pending. Hundreds of persons were unable to get within the Court House. It is supposed there were from twelve to fifteen hundred persons in the Court House on the last day of the trial. Among the number, 700 were females. Several fainted.

I had a dream the other night. I dreamed that you had come home. I thought I never was happier in my life but when I awoke and found it was only a dream, I felt sad, very sad.
</p><p>
I remain as ever, yours truly and devotedly,
</p><p>
