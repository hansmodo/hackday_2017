Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letters of the 16th, 24th, and 
30th of October, containing an account of the operations of the combined army, afford me the highest satisfaction; and I beg leave to congratulate your Excellency again upon this important and happy event. 
I contemplate its advantages with infinite satisfaction, 
and feel a relief upon the occasion that is difficult to 
express. <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a>'s stay in Virginia, and 
the march of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>, if he arrives speedily, 
I am in hopes will place us upon an eligible footing. 
The reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> is an event much to be 
wished ; but to be able to cover the country and 
confine the enemy to that place, will be a great object. However, I am not without my apprehensions 
that Sir Henry Clinton will endeavour to push some 
vigorous operations in this quarter this "winter, to 
efface, if possible, their late losses, hoth here and in 
Virginia. General Leslie is arrived to take command 
here, and it is said reenforcements are expected. I 
have sent one of my Aids to hasten the march of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> ; and, as Wilmington is evacuated, 
there is nothing to prevent an immediate junction. 
After which, if the enemy's reenforcements are not 
very large, they shall purchase their advantages at 
an expensive rate.

I would have made a return immediately of the 
prisoners of war in this department, but Major Hyrne, 
the Commissary of Prisoners, has lately met with an 
unhappy fall, which has disqualified him for business 
by disordering his understanding, from which I am 
not a little apprehensive he will never recover. As 
soon as it can be done by another hand, it shall be 
forwarded. But, before a general exchange is gone 
fully into, I wish something decisive may be done 
respecting Colonel Hayne. As retaliation necessarily 
involves the whole Continent, I wish your Excellency's order, and the order of Congress, thereon. The 
latter have signified their approbation of the measures 
I took. But, as retaliation did not take place immediately, nor did I think myself at liberty on a matter of such magnitude, but from the most pressing 
necessity, and as the enemy did not repeat the 
offence, I have been at a loss how to act with respect to the original, not having any officer of equal 
rank with Colonel Hayne in my possession. I am 
ready to execute whatever may be thought advisable. 
It would be happy for America if something could 
be done to put a stop to the practice of burning, 
both in the Northern States and here also ; and to prevent it liere, I wrote the enemy a letter on the 
subject, a copy of which I here inclose ; and, if they 
do not desist, I will put the war on the footing I mention.

We are on our march for Four Holes. Colonel 
Mblark brought off upwards of eighty convalescent 
prisoners from one of the enemy's hospitals near Fair 
Lawn. These, and some small skirmishes of little 
consequence, and a few other prisoners, are all the 
changes which have taken place since my letters by 
Captain Pierce. I am happy that Wilmington is 
evacuated, as it leaves North Carolina perfectly at 
liberty to support this army and fill up their line. 
I am, with great respect and attachment, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
