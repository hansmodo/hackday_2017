Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the fourth instant arrived yesterday afternoon, and 
I write now, that I may be in time for the post tomorrow. I 
believe the delay of my letter was not in this city. As the 
six millions are, I suppose, paid, it is not necessary to dilate 
on that subject. 
</p><p>
In regard to the extent of my powers, I will explain to you my ideas thereon. At first I supposed that the management of 
what relates to our debt was in some sort a needful appendage to this mission. Mr Jefferson's letter committing to me expressly an incidental negotiation, respecting a small part of it, 
undeceived me. Counting however on your concurrence in 
such measures as might appear proper, I should have gone on 
to prepare with the Minister a plan for the final liquidation of 
this object, could I have prevailed on him to attend to it. I 
have since had occasion, when I treated with the Commissaries 
of the treasury, to examine a little more minutely into my powers, so far as they relate to the debt, and I found that the management of it was committed entirely, and of course exclusively to you. Whether the knowledge they must have acquired 
before the present moment, that nothing final is done, joined 
to the idea that you are in Spain, will induce them to address 
their orders to me, I know not ; and you will, I trust, excuse 
me for adding that I hope not. 
</p><p>
Of all things I wish to steer clear of pecuniary transactions, 
because they involve a species of responsibility which is most 
irksome, and expose the agent to the chance of being called 
by every calumniator, to answer at the bar of public opinion. 
</p><p>
You tell me, in the very moment you express an apprehension as to the validity of transactions with the present government, that you would be glad that I should take up certain of 
our obligations, &tc. &c. On this head I must observe to you, 
that the informations you have received and communicated to 
me respecting the state of the account, and the objections made 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, prove beyond a possibility of 
doubt, that our government do not mean or wish that I should 
meddle therein. I have not received a line from the Secretary of the Treasury of any kind. 
</p><p>
To return however to your wish. You will doubtless see 
with me, that our obligations do not constitute, but only evidence 
our debt. To possess ourselves of them, therefore, otherwise 
than by due payment, would not cancel or alter the debt. 
And from the moment you impeach the right of the present 
government to receive the money, you invalidate any transactions respecting it which they may make. This observation I 
make for your consideration ; it cannot in any wise affect my 
conduct, because I am for the reasons already mentioned quite 
unauthorised, and indeed indirectly prohibited from acting in 
that behalf. 
</p><p>
Among the many scenes of bloodshed, which have of late 
been exhibited, you will lament the fate of the Duke de la 
Rochefoucault, killed in the presence of his aged mother. I 
am, &c.
