MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
I WROTE you from <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and once 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; but have not yet had the pleasure 
of a letter from you since I left home. The night 
before last we had a deep snow, which will probably 
extinguish all remaining apprehensions of infection, 
We hear of no sickness, and all seem at their ease, 
and without fear. 
</p><p>
The President's speech will show you an abundance of serious business which we have before us. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> called on me last night, and informed 
me that to-day we should have the whole budget of 
foreign affairs, British as well as French. He seems 
as little satisfied with the conduct of the French minister, as any one. Thomas spent the last evening 
with me. He has had an opportunity of seeing the 
courts, judges, lawyers, &c., of New Jersey, in the 
course of the last fall, and has, I hope, employed his 
time to advantage. This day, he is to be examined, 
and this week, sworn in. May a blessing attend him. 
Although I have attended and shall attend my duty 
punctually in senate, I shall not run about upon visits, 
without caution. Yet I believe there is little or no 
danger.

The Viscount Noailles called on me, and I enquired after all his connexions in a family, which I 
knew to be once in great power, wealth and splendor. 
He seems to despair of liberty in France, and has 
lost apparently all hopes of ever living in France. 
He was very critical in his enquiries concerning the 
letters which were printed as mine in England. I 
told him candidly that I did not write them, and as 
frankly in confidence, who did. He says they made 
a great impression upon the people of England. That 
he heard Mr. Wind ham and Mr. Fox speak of them, 
as the best thing that had been written, and as one of 
the best pieces both of reasoning and style they had ever read. The marquis, he says, is living, but injured in his health. Your old friend, the marchioness, 
still lives in France, in obscurity in the country. He 
thinks that a Constitution like that of England, would 
not last three days in France, and that monarchy will 
not be restored in a dozen years, if ever. The partitioning and arbitrary spirit of the combined powers, 
will contribute more than any thing towards uniting 
the French under their old government. Frenchmen 
cannot bear the partition of their country ; and rather 
than see it divided among their neighbors, they will 
unite in something or other. 
</p><p>
It will require all the address, all the temper, and 
all the firmness of Congress and the States to keep 
this people out of the war; or rather, to avoid a 
declaration of war against us, from some mischievous 
power or other. It is but little that I can do, either 
by the functions which the constitution has intrusted 
to me, or by my personal influence ; but that little 
shall be industriously employed, until it is put beyond 
a doubt that it will be fruitless, and then, I shall be as 
ready to meet unavoidable calamities as any other 
citizen. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
