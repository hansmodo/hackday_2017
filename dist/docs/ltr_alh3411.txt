MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since I had the pleasure of writing you last, an unexpected change has taken place in my situation. I am no 
longer a member of the General's family. This information will surprise you, and the manner of the change will 
surprise you more. Two days ago, the General and I 
passed each other on the stairs ; he told me he wanted 
to speak to me, I answered that I would wait upon him 
immediately. I went below, and delivered Mr. Tilghman 
a letter to be sent to the commissary, containing an order 
of a pressing and interesting nature. 
</p><p>
Returning to the General, I was stopped on the way by 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague friend met'>Marquis de La Fayette</a>, and we conversed together 
about a minute on a matter of business. He can testify 
how impatient I was to get back, and that I left him in a 
manner which, but for our intimacy, would have been more 
than abrupt. Instead of finding the General, as is usual, in 
his room, I met him at the head of the stairs, where accosting me in an angry tone, " <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='me'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, (said he,) 
you have kept me waiting at the head of the stairs these 
ten minutes ; I must tell you, sir, you treat me with disrespect." I replied, without petulancy, but with decision, 
I am not conscious of it, sir, but since you have thought 
it necessary to tell me so, we part." " Very well, sir, (said 
he,) if it be your choice," or something to this effect, and we 
separated. I sincerely believe my absence, which gave so 
much umbrage, did not last two minutes. 
</p><p>
In less than an hour after, Tilghman came to me in the 
General's name, assuring me of his great confidence in my 
abilities, integrity, usefulness, &c., and of his desire, in a 
candid conversation, to heal a difference which could not 
have happened but in a moment of passion. I requested 
Mr. Tilghman to tell him, 1st. That I had taken my resolution in a manner not to be revoked. 2d. That as a conversation could serve no other purpose than to produce explanations, mutually disagreeable, though I certainly would 
not refuse an interview, if he desired it, yet I would be happy, if he would permit me to decline it. 3d. That though 
determined to leave the family, the same principles which 
had kept me so long in it, would continue to direct my conduct towards him when out of it. 4th. That, however, I 
did not wish to distress him, or the public business, by quitting him before he could derive other assistance by the return of some of the gentlemen who were absent. 5th. And 
that in the mean time, it depended on him, to let our behaviour to each other be the same as if nothing had happened. He consented to decline the conversation, and thanked 
me for my offer of continuing my aid in the manner I had 
mentioned. 
</p><p>
I have given you so particular a detail of our difference, 
from the desire I have to justify myself in your opinion. 
Perhaps you may think I was precipitate in rejecting the 
overture made by the General to an accommodation. I 
assure you, my dear sir, it was not the effect of resentment ; 
it was the deliberate result of maxims I had long formed 
for the government of my own conduct. 
</p><p>
I always disliked the office of an aid-de-camp, as having 
in it a kind of personal dependence. I refused to serve in 
this capacity with two Major Generals, at an early period 
of the war. Infected, however, with the enthusiasm of the 
times, an idea of the General's character overcame my 
scruples, and induced me to accept his invitation to enter 
into his family   . I(. has been often with great difficulty that I have prevailed upon myself not to renounce it ; 
but while, from motives of public utility, I was doing violence to my feelings, I was always determined, if there 
should ever happen a breach between us, never to consent 
to an accommodation. I was persuaded, that when once 
that nice barrier, which marked the boundaries of what we 
owed to each other, should be thrown down, it might be 
propped again, but could never be restored. 
</p><p>
The General is a very honest man ; his competitors 
have slender abilities, and less integrity. His popularity 
has often been essential to the safety of America, and is 
still of great importance to it. These considerations have 
influenced my past conduct respecting him, and will influence my future ; I think it is necessary he should be 
supported. 
</p><p>
His estimation in your mind, whatever maybe its amount, 
I am persuaded has been formed on principles, which a 
circumstance like this cannot materially affect ; but if I 
thought it could diminish your friendship for him, I should 
almost forego the motives that urge me to justify myself to 
you. I wish what I have said to make no other impression, than to satisfy you I have not been in the wrong. It 
is also said in confidence, as a public knowledge of the 
breach would, in many ways, have an ill effect. It will, 
probably, be the policy of both sides to conceal it, and cover the separation with some plausible pretext. I am importuned by such of my friends as are privy to the affair, to 
listen to a reconciliation ; but my resolution is unalterable. 
</p><p>
As I cannot think of quitting the army during the war, I 
have a project of re-entering into the artillery, by taking Lieutenant Colonel Forrest's place, who is desirous of retiring on half-pay. I have not, however, made up my mind 
upon this head, as I should be obliged to come in the 
youngest lieutenant colonel instead of the eldest, which 
I ought to have been by natural succession, had I remained 
in the corps; and, at the same time, to resume studies relative to the profession, which to avoid inferiority, must be 
laborious. 
</p><p>
If a handsome command in the campaign in the light infantry should offer itself, I shall balance between this and 
the artillery. My situation in the latter would be more 
solid and permanent ; but as I ^hope the war will not last 
long enough to make it progressive, this consideration has 
the less force. A command for the campaign, would leave 
me the winter to prosecute studies relative to my future 
career in life   . I have written to you on this subject 
with all the freedom and confidence to which you have a 
right, and with an assurance of the interest you take in all 
that concerns me. 
</p><p>
Very sincerely and affectionately, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">A. HAMILTON.</a>.
