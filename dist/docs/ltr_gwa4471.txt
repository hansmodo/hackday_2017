Sir, 
</p><p>
My partial acquaintance with either our naval or commercial affairs makes it altogether impossible for me to 
account for the unfortunate delay of those articles of 
military stores and clothing, which I have been informed have been so long provided in France. If I had 
had any particular reason to suspect you of being 
accessory to that delay, which I assure you was not 
the case, my suspicions would have been removed by 
the very full and satisfactory answers, which you have, 
to the best of my judgment, made to the questions 
proposed to you by the Board of Admiralty, and upon which that Board have in their report to Congress 
testified the high sense, which they entertain of your 
merits and services. 
</p><p>
Whether our naval affairs have been well or ill conducted, it would be presumptuous in me to determine. 
Instances of bravery and good conduct in several of 
our officers have not been wanting. Delicacy forbids 
me to mention the particular one, which has attracted 
the admiration of all the world, and influenced a most 
illustrious monarch to confer a mark of his favor, that 
can be attained only by a long and honorable service, 
or by the performance of some brilliant action. That 
you may long enjoy the reputation you have so justly 
acquired, is the sincere wish of Sir, &c.
