Dear Brother: A few days ago at the request of a 
mutual friend, I sent to General J. E. Johnston at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a>, the eight volumes of the report of the committee on 
the conduct of the war. 
</p><p>
In writing him I called his attention to the recent 
feeling here on the subject of the Ku Klux, and that I 
did not believe he or the Confederate officers were either 
the instigators, or passive aiders of these disgraceful 
acts. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately, etc., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>.
