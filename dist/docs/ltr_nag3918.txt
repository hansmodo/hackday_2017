DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I had a line from you a day or two ago, and am glad to hear you are 
in a fair way of bringing the people upon the Pee Dee to a better 
temper. I wish the business was over, and you on this side the Santee. 
The Tories in that quarter are doing great mischief, and distressing all 
the good people in that quarter. By a person just from town, I learn 
the enemy are equipping three galleys for the destruction of the stores 
at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. Put the people there on their guard, and give every 
necessary order for the defence of the place. If there are any public 
stores in town that cannot be immediately sent to the army, for want of 
wagons, they had best be sent up the river to the place you mentioned 
to me. We have no news from the Northward. The enemy talk 
loudly again in Charlestown of a peace. In haste, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, 
</p>
