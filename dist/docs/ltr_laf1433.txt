<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Dear General</a>,--How happy I have been in receiving your excellency's
favour of the tenth present; I hope you will be convinced by the
knowledge of my tender affection for you. I am very sensible of that
goodness which tries to dissipate my fears about that ridiculous
Canadian expedition. At the present time we know which was the aim of
the honourable board, and for which project three or four men have
rushed the country into a great expense, and risked the reputation of
our arms, and the life of many hundred men, had the general, your
deceived friend, been as rash and foolish as they seem to have
expected. O, American freedom, what shall become of you if you are in
such hands?
</p><p>
I have received a letter from the board and a resolve of congress,
by which you are directed to recall me and the Baron de Kalb, whose
presence is deemed absolutely necessary to your army. I believe this of
General Conway is _absolutely necessary_ to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, and he has received
orders to stay there, which I have no objection to, as nothing,
perhaps, will be done in this quarter but some disputes of Indians and
tories. However, you know I have wrote to congress, and as soon as
their leave will come, I shall let Conway have the command of these few
regiments, and I shall immediately join my respectable friend; but till
I have received instructions for leaving that place from yourself, I
shall stay, as powerful commander-in-chief, as if congress had never
resolved my presence absolutely necessary for the great army.
</p><p>
Since your last letter, I have given up the idea of New York, and my
only desire is to join you. The only favour I have asked of your
commissioners in France, has been, not to be under any orders but those
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="colleague met"><a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>General Washington</a></a>. I seem to have had an anticipation of our future
friendship, and what I have done out of esteem and respect for your
excellency's name and reputation, I should do now out of mere love for
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="colleague met"><a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>General Washington</a></a> himself. I am glad to hear <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met friend'>General Greene</a> is
quarter-master-general; it is very interesting to have there an honest
man and a friend of yours. But I feel the greatest pain not to hear
anything about reinforcements. What can you do with a handful of men,--
and my poor division, whom I was so desirous of instructing, clothing,
managing myself in the winter, whom, I was told, I should find six
thousand strong at the opening of the campaign? Don't your excellency
think that I could recruit a little in <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met friend'>General Greene</a>'s division now
that he is quarter-master-general? By that promotion I find myself very
proud to be the third officer of your army.
</p><p>
With the utmost respect and affection, I have the honour to be, &c.
</p>
