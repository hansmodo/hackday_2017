My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The difficulties, which you daily encounter and surmount with your small force, add not a little to your 
reputation ; and I am pretty well assured, that, should 
you be obliged finally to withdraw from South Carolina 
and even from North Carolina, it will not be attributed 
to your want either of abilities or of exertion, but to 
the true cause, the want of means to support the war 
in them. I feel for your mortification at the loss of the 
day before Camden, after it seemed so much in your 
favor; but I hope you will have found, that the enemy 
suffered severely, as in their publication of the affair in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> they confess the loss of two hundred. The 
reduction of Fort Watson does honor to <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='co-worker'>General Marion</a> and Colonel Lee. 
</p><p>
I have lately had an interview with <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> at Weathersfield. Our affairs were very attentively considered in every point of view, and it was 
finally determined to make an attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
with its present garrison, in preference to a southern 
operation, as we had not the decided command of the 
water. You will readily suppose the reasons, which 
induced this determination, were the inevitable loss of 
men from so long a march, more especially in the approaching hot season, and the difficulty, I may say impossibility, of transporting the necessary baggage, artillery, and stores by land. If I am supported as I 
ought to be by the neighbouring States in this operation, which you know has always been their favorite 
one, I hope that one of these consequences will follow, 
either that the enemy will be expelled from the most valuable position which they hold upon the continent, or be obliged to recall part of their force from the 
southward to defend it. Should the latter happen, you 
will be most essentially relieved by it. The French 
troops will begin their march this way as soon as certain circumstances will admit. I can only give you the 
outlines of our plan. The dangers, to which letters are 
exposed, make it improper to commit to paper the 
particulars ; but as matters ripen I will keep you as 
well informed as circumstances will allow. 
</p><p>
A detachment of between fifteen hundred and two 
thousand men sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> about the 13th of 
May. I advised <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker met'>Baron Steuben</a> of this, and desired 
him to communicate it to you. I presume they will 
either stop in the Chesapeake Bay or Cape Fear River, 
unless the operations of the Spaniards in the Floridas 
should call for reinforcement to that quarter. But I 
can hardly flatter myself, that they will attend to the 
preservation of St. Augustine. We are told that Pensacola has fallen. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> informed me, that about 
eight hundred recruits would be ready to march from 
Virginia by the latter end of May. I have no certain 
accounts from Maryland lately ; but I was told by a 
gentleman from thence, that about four hundred might 
be expected to march in April. I make no doubt but 
you are kept regularly advised by the superintending 
officers. I have not heard, that <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='co-worker'>General Wayne</a> had 
left Yorktown, but I have reason to believe he has 
gone before this time. If no fresh discontents arise 
among those troops, the detachment with Wayne will 
be a most valuable acquisition to you. They are chiefly 
the old soldiers, and completely furnished with every 
necessary. I am, &,c.
