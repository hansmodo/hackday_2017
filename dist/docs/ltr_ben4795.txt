MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received your kind Letter of Aug. 16, which gave me a 
great deal of Satisfaction. I am glad your little Grandson 
recovered so soon of his Illness, as I see you are quite in Love 
with him, and your Happiness wrapt up in his; since your 
whole long Letter is made up of the History of his pretty 
Actions. It was very prudently done of you not to interfere 
when his Mother thought fit to correct him; which pleases 
me the more, as I feared, from your Fondness of him, that 
he would be too much humoured, and perhaps spoiled. 
There is a story of two little Boys in the Street; one was 
crying bitterly; the other came to him to ask what was the 
Matter ? I have been, says he, " for a pennyworth of Vinegar, 
and I have broke the Glass, and spilt the Vinegar, and my 
Mother will whip me." No, she won't whip you, says the 
other. Indeed, she will, says he. What, says the other, have you then got ne'er a Grandmother? 
</p><p>
I am sorry I did not send one of my Books to Mr. Rhodes, 
since he was desirous of seeing it. My Love to him, and to 
all enquiring Friends. Mrs. West was here to-day, and desired me to mention her Love to you. Mr. Strahan and 
Family are all well, always enquire how you all do, & send 
their Love. Mrs. Stevenson is at present in the Country. 
But Polly sends her Love to you, and Mrs. Bache, & the 
young Gentleman. I am, as ever, your affectionate Husband, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
