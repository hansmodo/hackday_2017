TO HIS EXCELLENCY <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met">General Washington</a>.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, November 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>.

Sir,
</p><p>
I enclose your Excellency a copy of an intercepted letter from Major
General Leslie to Lord Cornwallis. [See Appendix, note F.] It was taken
from a person endeavoring to pass through the country from Portsmouth
towards Carolina. When apprehended, and a proposal made to search him,
he readily consented to be searched, but, at the same time, was observed
to put his hand into his pocket and carry something towards his mouth,
as if it were a quid of tobacco: it was examined, and found to be a
letter, of which the enclosed is a copy, written on silk paper, rolled
up in gold-beater's skin, and nicely tied at each end, so as not to be
larger than a goose quill. As this is the first authentic disclosure of
their purpose in coming here, and may serve to found, with somewhat more
of certainty, conjectures respecting their future movements, while their
disappointment in not meeting with Lord Cornwallis may occasion
new plans at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a>, I thought it worthy of communication to your
Excellency.
</p><p>
Some deserters were taken yesterday, said to be of the British
Convention troops, who had found means to get to the enemy at
Portsmouth, and were seventy or eighty miles on their way back to the
barracks, when they were taken. They were passing under the guise of
deserters from Portsmouth.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem and respect,
</p><p>
your Exellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
