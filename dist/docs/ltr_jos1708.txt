SENATE CHAMBER, 
</p><p>

Dear Brother: . . . You are living the life proper 
for your position and services, everywhere welcome, 
all you say and do applauded, and secure in a competence 
and independent in all things. I will deliver your message to Edmunds, but you will not probably find him at 
Burlington, August 20th. We are to have important 
questions before us, but I mean to act not as a laborer 
but as an umpire. I am for peace at home and abroad, 
and if I cannot do much that is actively good I will try 
and prevent harm, and if possible will tranquilly glide 
down the rest of the road of life, enjoying all I can and 
helping those who deserve help. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jos" rel="me">John Sherman</a>.
