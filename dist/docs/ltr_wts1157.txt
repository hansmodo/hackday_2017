Dear Brother: I have been importuned from many 
quarters for my likeness, autographs, and biography. I 
have managed to fend off all parties and hope to do so 
till the end of the war. I don't want to rise or be notorious, for the reason that a mere slip or accident may let 
me fall, and I don't care about falling so far as most of 
the temporary heroes of the war. The real men of the 
war will be determined by the closing scenes, and then 
the army will determine the questions. 'Newspaper 
puffs and self-written biographies will then be ridiculous caricatures^ Already has time marked this progress and indicated this conclusion. 
</p><p>
If parties apply to you for materials in my behalf, 
give the most brief and general items, and leave the 
results to the close of the war or of my career. As well 
might a judge or senator seek for fame outside their 
spheres of action as an officer of the army. We must 
all be judged by our own peers, stand or fall by their 
verdict. I know I stand very high with the army, and 
feel no concern on that score. To-day I can do more 
with Admiral Porter or the Generals than any general 
officer out West except Grant, and with him I am as a 
second self. We are personal and official friends. 
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
