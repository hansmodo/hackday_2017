WEAVERVILLE, September 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1852">1852</a>

A great many of the emigrants from the plains are coming here and we have had several females added to our society. I hope they will improve it. Nothing fatal has taken place since my last letter but there have been some awfully close shaves. One man has been shot through the cravat, one through the hat and one in the arm. The Weaverville Hotel has been sacked and fist fights without number have come off, but as nobody has been killed nothing has been done.

We are immersed in politics. Nothing else is talked about and the party lines are drawn tight. There is no half-way ground here, no neutral party. It is 'Scott and Graham' or 'Pierce and King.' Of course, you know what side I shout for and our party outnumbers the other vastly. I am quite prominent on the subject and was one of the delegates to the County Convention and might have run for the Legislature had I been able to attend to it (What do you think of that!). But it costs something to canvass a county and get an office here. We have selected good men and I think the Whig ticket in this county will be elected sure.

We have erected a pole 130 feet high with a Scott and Graham flag, of the largest size, at a cost of $300. One
man gave $50 toward it--Judge Turner. He is going to spend $10,000 in this and Klamath Counties to elect the Whig ticket. So you see we go into politics like everything else here: with a rush.

I have just returned from a trip to the South Fork of Trinity River, where I spent two days with a party shooting. It is the greatest country for game I have seen in the State. Unlike most parts of the mines, here is a large valley or meadow of good land, from one to five miles broad and thirty long, covered with grass and the banks of the streams lined with cottonwood trees. This valley is hemmed in with lofty mountains and is a beautiful spot. There is a natural bridge of rock across the stream and several sulphur springs here. It is a favorite resort of the Indians and the squaws are now busily engaged gathering seeds and berries for winter. They are peaceable now and are living near the whites. Several of them have been in town and efforts are now being made to bring them all in and make them live within reach. This is far better than keeping them in the mountains and having continual war. It was in this valley that the rancherio was situated that was destroyed last Spring, when 125 Indians were killed and only two were saved alive. 'Kate,' a squaw about 16 years old, crawled into a log and has since been living in town and has no desire to go back, and a little one that Mrs. Ewing has adopted to grow up with her child.

We saw lots of fish weirs and snares for deer made by the Indians with great ingenuity. We shot lots of game: deer, grey squirrels, pigeons, grouse, quails, etc., and then such eating you never saw! We had venison stewed with pigeons and broiled quails, fricasseed squirrel, roast ribs, venison steaks, etc. You used to think I ate some at home but if you have been at our camp that night and seen the enormous quantity I devoured, you would not like to
board me. But if you want to get up an appetite just stroll over the mountains all day without anything to eat. And then, you never saw any game fit to eat down East. Everything is fat here. We saw tracks of a grizzly but did not meet with him, and in the night 'heard a savage lion's awful roar'! These animals called a California lion are more like a panther. I saw one at Shasta in a cage, over six feet long.

If there is anything I enjoy it is an excursion like this and I think Joseph would. If you hear anyone from this country calling this a poor miserable barren country, tell them I can take my rifle and ammunition and live better than they can at home on a good income.

I shall be right glad to see Sarah. She will probably be here about the 1st of November if she gets up here without being sick. She can't fail to be healthy and although it is sickly this fall in the valley, it is perfectly healthy here.

There is not a lb of flour in town. It is worth $35 a bbl at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and the last was sold here for 45¢ a pound. Beef and potatoes are plentiful. There is a garden in town owned by a Mr. Howe, who has raised this season 32,000 hills of potatoes. They average 2 1/2 lbs to the hill and sell for 20¢ per lb. Now figure that up and then see how many farms in the State of Maine it would take to produce the amount! They have found gold in his garden this winter, so it will probably be dug up.

Cole leaves in a few minutes for Shasta and I must close or, as we say here at political speeches when they don't suit, 'dry up.' Give my love to the 'Old Folks at Home'...
