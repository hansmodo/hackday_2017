Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 11th July gave me much pleasure ; 
there is a degree of ease and cordiality in it, which, as a 
mere letter of business, it did not require. I am the more 
obliged to you for it. 
</p><p>
It is true that I might write to Congress very often, indeed by every vessel, and there are many of them ; but how are 
my letters to get to the seaside ? By the post ? They would be all inspected, and many suppressed. There is 
scarce a man in any of the ports, except Mr. Harrison, at Cadiz, with whom I would trust them ; so that if under 
different covers I could get them there, the danger would not end. To write often, and write nothing material, would 
be useless ; and when you see my public letter by this opportunity, you will perceive that to be well understood I 
must write a great deal. I would throw stones, too. with all my heart, if I thought they would hit only the committee 
without injuring the members of it. Till now I have received but one letter from them, and that not worth s 
farthing, though it conveyed a draft for one hundred thousand pounds sterling on the bank of hope. One good 
private correspondent would be worth twenty standing committees, made of the wisest heads in America, for the 
purpose of intelligence. What with clever wives, or pleasant walks, or too tired, or too busy, or do you do it, very little is done, much postponed, and more neglected. 
</p><p>
If you, who are naturally industrious and love your country, would frequently take up your pen and your 
ciphers, and tell me how the wheel of politics runs, and what measures it is from time to time turning out, I should 
be better informed, and Congress better served. I now get more intelligence of your affairs from the French ambassador, than from all the members of Congress put together. 
</p><p>
I had written thus far when I received a letter from Mr. Le Couteux, at Cadiz, enclosing a letter of the lGth of September, written at St. Ildefonso from me to Congress. 
It had been enclosed in one to Mr. Harrison, and that again put under cover to Mr. Le Couteux, and under these two 
covers was put into the post-office. Now mark its fate. The director of the post-office at Cadiz showed it to Mr. Le Couteux, naked and stripped of its two covers, of which 
he made no mention. He said it came from Bayonne, but Le Couteux, knowing my handwriting, paid the postage and returned it to me. 
</p><p>
This is only one among the many instances of the fate 
to which my letters are subjected. To avoid it I must now 
be at the expense of sending Colonel Livingston to the seaside with my despatches. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
