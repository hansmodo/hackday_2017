<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='21'>21st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Both of us were too ill to attend <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> reception. It proved a very sensational one. First, 
a fire in the house, then a robbery said to be an arranged plan of the usual bribed servants there and some escaped 
Yankee prisoners. To-day the Examiner is lost in wonder at the stupidity of the fire and arson contingent. If they 
had only waited a few hours until everybody was asleep; after a reception the household would be so tired and so 
sound asleep. Thanks to the editor's kind counsel maybe the arson contingent will wait and do better next time.

Letters from home carried Mr. Chesnut off to-day. Thackeray is dead. I stumbled upon Vanity Fair for my 
self. I had never heard of Thackeray before. I think it was in 1850. I know I had been ill at the New York Hotel, 
and when left alone, I slipped down-stairs and into a book store that I had noticed under the hotel, for something to 
read. They gave me the first half of Pendennis. I can recall now the very kind of paper it was printed on, and the 
illustrations, as they took effect upon me. And yet when I raved over it, and was wild for the other half, there were 
people who said it was slow ; that Thackeray was evidently a coarse, dull, sneering writer ; that he stripped human nature bare, and made it repulsive, etc.
