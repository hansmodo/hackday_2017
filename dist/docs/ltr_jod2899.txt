YESTERDAY I had the pleasure of dining with Mr. Purviance. There are two gentlemen of this name in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, Samuel and Robert, eminent merchants 
and in partnership. We had a brilliant company, the 
two Mrs. Purviances, the two Lees, the ladies of the 
two Colonels R. H. and F., Mrs. Hancock and Miss 
Katy, and a young lady that belongs to the family. 
If this letter, like some other wise ones, should be intercepted, I suppose I shall be called to account for 
not adjusting the rank of these ladies a little better. 
Mr. Hancock, the two Colonel Lees, Colonel Whipple, 
Colonel Page, Colonel Ewing, the two Mr. Purviances 
and a young gentleman. I fancy I have named all the 
company. How happy would this entertainment 
have been to me if I could, by a single volition, have 
transported one lady about five hundred miles. But 
alas ! this is a greater felicity than falls to my share. 
We have voted to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> next week.

We have made General Lincoln a continental Major General. We shall make Colonel Glover a Brigadier. I sincerely wish we could hear more from General Heath. Many persons are extremely dissatisfied with numbers of the general officers of the highest 
rank. I Don't mean the Commander-in-chief, his character is justly very high, but Schuyler, Putnam, Spencer, Heath, are thought by very few to be 
capable of the great commands they hold. We hear of none of their heroic deeds of arms. I 
wish they would all resign. For my part I will vote upon the genuine principles of a republic for a new 
election of general officers annually, and every man shall have my consent to be left out, who does not give sufficient proof of his qualifications.

I wish my lads were old enough. I would send every one of them into the army in some capacity or other. Military abilities and experience are a great advantage to any character.
