DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
With this you will receive some Sheets of the Piece now 
printing, and which I am promised shall be finish'd in a few 
Days. I am afraid it is not so correct as it should be ; But 
as I have been advis'd not to publish it till next Month, most 
of our Gentry being yet out of Town, there will be time for 
you to send me the Errata which may be printed at the End. 
</p><p>
I send you also Dr Priestly's Essay on the first Principles 
of [Government] lately published, in which you will find 
some [mutilated] & free Sentiments. 
</p><p>
I wrote to you two or three Weeks since by M. Lettsom a Quaker Physician, recommending him to your Civilities.
I can now only add, with my best Respects to good Madame 
Dubourg, that I am as ever, Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate Friend, & most obedient humble Servt. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to present my respectful Compliments to M. Beaumont, for whom I have the highest Esteem, and to 
Mr Dupont. Please to acquaint the latter, that Dr. Templeman had done nothing in the Subscriptions, the Society 
having been in Vacance; and the good Gentleman, is, I am afraid, now dying.
