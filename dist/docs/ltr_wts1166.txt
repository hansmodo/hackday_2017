Dear Brother: I got your letters by Mr. Kinneard, 
and spent a whole day with him and his party, first in 
a steamboat going up and down the river, then in carriages, and finally at a banquet. The whole party 
seemed much pleased with the courtesies shown them, 
and to me were sufficiently complimentary. General 
Grant was here also, and they expressed themselves 
more than usually pleased at the opportunity to see us 
together. In Europe they are settling down to the conviction that Grant and I accomplished the military 
problem, and now they look to you to bring order, system, and prosperity out of the wreck. I am well satisfied at the course things are taking. No matter what 
change we may desire in the feelings and thoughts of 
people South, we cannot accomplish it by force. Nor 
can we afford to maintain there/an army large enough to 
hold them in subjugationr~^Arll we can, or should, attempt 
is to give them rope, to develop in an honest way if 
possible, preserving in reserve enough military power to 
check any excesses if they attempt any. But I know 
they will not attempt any, and you may look for outbreaks in Ohio quicker than in Georgia or Mississippi. 
You hardly yet realize how completely this country has 
been devastated, and how completely humbled the man 
of the South is. Of course editors and talkers may express opinions we don't like, but they will take good 
care not to reduce those opinions to acts.

Affectionately,
