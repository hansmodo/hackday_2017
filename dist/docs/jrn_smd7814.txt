I have had such a search for shoes this week that 
I am disgusted with shopping. I am triumphant 
now, for after traversing the town in every direction 
and finding nothing, I finally discovered a pair of 
boots just made for a little negro to go fishing with, 
and only an inch and a half too long for me, besides 
being unbendable; but I seized them with avidity, 
and the little negro would have been outbid if I had 
not soon after discovered a pair more seemly, if not 
more serviceable, which I took without further difficulty. Behold my tender feet cased in crocodile skin, 
patent-leather tipped, low-quarter boy's shoes, 
No. 2! What a fall was there, my country," from 
my pretty English glove-kid, to sabots made of some 
animal closely connected with the hippopotamus! 
A dernier ressort, vraiment 1 for my choice was that, 
or cooling my feet on the burning pavement au naturel; I who have such a terror of any one seeing 
my naked foot ! And this is thanks to war and blockade! Not a decent shoe in the whole community! 
N importe! "Better days are coming, we ll all" 
have shoes after a while perhaps ! Why did not 
Mark Tapley leave me a song calculated to keep the 
spirits up, under depressing circumstances? I need 
one very much, and have nothing more suggestive 
than the old Methodist hymn, "Better days are 
coming, we ll all go right," which I shout so constantly, as our prospects darken, that it begins to sound stale.
