</p><p>
MAJOR GENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD.
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL:--I have received and read your letter of the 14th of
July.
</p><p>
I think the suggestion you make, of discontinuing proceedings against
Mr. McKee, a very proper one. While I admit that there is an
apparent impropriety in the publication of the letter mentioned,
without my consent or yours, it is still a case where no evil could
result, and which I am entirely willing to overlook.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
