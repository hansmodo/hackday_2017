Instructions. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The object of your present command, — consisting of two regiments, formed into four battalions, under the 
command of Colonel Scammell and Lieutenant-Colonel Sprout, of a detachment of artillery under the command of Captain Burbeck, of the corps of watermen 
under the command of Major Darby, and the waterguard under the command of Captain Pray, — is to attempt the surprise of the enemy's posts upon the north end of York Island. 
</p><p>
My ideas, as to the most probable mode of attaining this object, have been minutely detailed in the several conversations which we have had upon the subject, 
and you have been furnished with such papers as I 
have been able to collect, and upon which my judgment has been formed. But it is not my wish, or desire, that these should be any restraint upon you. 
Your own observation and the circumstances of the 
moment must in a great degree govern you. 
</p><p>
The success of your enterprise depending absolutely 
upon secrecy and surprise, it w ill be wrong to prosecute it a moment after you are discovered, unless the 
discovery is made so near the works, that you may, by 
a rapid movement, gain them before the enemy have 
time to recollect and put themselves in a posture of 
defence. Fort George, upon Laurel Hill, ought to be 
your primary object, because success at that place will 
open a communication with the main, afford an asylum 
to the troops, who may be disappointed in other attacks, and secure a retreat in case of necessity to the 
main body of the army. 
</p><p>
Should you carry Fort Knyphausen and Fort Tryon only, you cannot without infinite risk hold them, as we shall not be in a situation to support you from without. 
I would therefore recommend your damaging them as much as you possibly can and relinquishing them. The artillery-men will be proportionably divided for the three 
attacks ; each party will be provided with two lanterns and two rockets, one of which is to be fired in each work as soon as it is carried. 
</p><p>
It" complete success should attend the enterprise, not 
a moment should be lost in drawing the boats across 
the Island from the North River into Haerlem Creek, 
and securing them under the guns of Fort George, if 
circumstances will admit of it. But in case of a disappointment, and being obliged to retreat by water, 
and not being able to pass the enemy's ships and boats, 
the dernier resort must be a push over to the Jersey 
shore, and an abandonment of the boats, if they cannot 
be drawn up the bank and carried ofT on carriages. It 
will be very essential, that I should be made acquainted 
as early as possible with your success, and the extent 
of it. If complete, you will announce it by the firing 
of thirteen cannon, at one minute's interval, after all less 
firing and confusion have ceased. If Fort George only 
is carried, six cannon are to be fired in the same manner. For Fort Knyphausen, Tryon, or both of them, 
you need not give a signal, because you are, as before 
directed, immediately to relinquish them. 
</p><p>
The foregoing is upon a supposition, that the principal object, the attempt upon the works on York 
Island, is carried into execution ; hut, should you, upon 
reconnoitering the enemy to-morrow, find it unadvisable 
to prosecute the plan, or should you be obliged to give 
it over on account of an early discovery by the enemy's 
shipping or boats, I would then have you turn your attention to the support of an attempt, which is also to 
be made on the morning of the 3d by the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a> upon Delancey's corps lying at Morrisania. 
To effect this, you will land your men at any convenient place above the mouth of Sphen Devil Creek, 
and march to the high grounds in front of Kingsbridge, 
where you will lie concealed until the Duke's attack is 
announced by firing or other means. You may then 
dispose of your force in such a manner, in view of the 
enemy, as to make them think your party larger than 
it is, which may have the double effect of preventing 
them from coming over the bridge to turn the Duke's 
right, and also of preventing any of Delancey's party 
from escaping that way. Your further operations must 
depend upon the movements of the enemy and other 
circumstances. 
</p><p>
I expect to be in the neighbourhood of Kingsbridge 
early in the morning of the 3d, with the remainder of 
the army. I shall as soon as possible open a communication with you, and give you such orders as the 
general state of matters may require. If you land upon the east side of the river, above the mouth of Spiten Devil Creek, you will send your boats up along 
the east shore. If Major Darby receives no particular 
directions from me, he will proceed with them to King's 
Ferry. Given at Head-Quarters, near <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city origin'>Peekskill</a>, this
