It is now just one weeke we bid farewell to Valparaiso, and thus far it has been the brightest in our calendar. We have made 1,051 miles in our course, which is by far the best week's sailing since we left our native shores, and of itself enough to keep us in good cheer for a week. No serious brawls have taken place, and consequently no black eyes or skinned noses are to be seen.
<p></p>
Several who commenced taking lessons in French have become tired and have given it up. About half a dozen of us, however, have kept on and we can now begin to speak, read, and translate a few sentences. Four or five of the Frenchmen have a pretty severe time of it on account of seasickness; all of our old passengers recovered in a day or two.
<p></p>
We now get along tolerably well at mealtime, much better at least than previous to our arrival at Valparaiso, and no complaints or murmurings are heard on this score. We now have potatoes twice per day, bread four times per week and duff twice with rice, or bean soup occasionally. This, gotten up in the manner it is, is bad enough in all conscience, but infinitely preferable to navy bread with half-inch worms in it, and salt pork and beef which formed our chief food ever since leaving home.
<p></p>
The atmosphere here on the Pacific is as warm as our own mid-summer. The evenings are beautiful, moonlit, and we have just had some tunes on the violin and a
number of songs from the merry Frenchmen. One or two of the boys are making merry over the flowing bowl, which I fear will yet ruin some of our company in a short time, should they not cease taking the poisonous draught so frequently after their arrival in California.
