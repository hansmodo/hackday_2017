Sir, 
</p><p>
I had yesterday the pleasure of receiving from the secretary of state, the letter which you did me the honour to write on the 22d May last. 
</p><p>
They who feel an interest in the honour of this country, cannot fail of being gratified by every mark of respect to 
the memory of our late president. The tribute of commendation paid to his merits by so many respectable persons in Great Britain, is no less honourable to them than to 
him ; and I very sincerely concur with you in wishing that the best understanding may always subsist between our two nations. 
</p><p>
The facsimile copies of the letters appear to me to be well executed, but I am not certain that the taste of this 
country is such as to produce a considerable demand for them. I shall immediately put the cards and subscription 
papers into the hands of such persons here, and at New-York, as I think most likely to promote the object of them. 
For my own part, I am preparing and expect to retire in the spring to my estate at Bedford, in the county of Westchester, about fifty miles from the city of New- York. I 
shall request the persons to whom the subscription papers will be delivered, to transmit them to Mr. Hugh Gaine, a 
bookseller of reputation at New-York ; and shall request him to communicate the result to Messrs. Nicoll, &c, in London.

Having, since my return from England, been constantly engaged in official affairs, I have had little leisure for other pursuits ; so much so that I have not, from that time to this, visited my estate more than twice in any one year.

A member of your board (of whose address I took a memorandum, which I have since often looked for without 
success) was so obliging as to send me a cask of English. I promised to try it, and inform him whether it 
succeeded. It was ground, and sent to my farm, where a t of it was used in like manner with French and New-England gypsum, but not with the like success ; it produced no visible effect. On being acquainted with this, I 
directed the remainder to be saved, in order that on my removal there might be tried under my own direction : 
</p><p>
if I live, this shall be done. 
</p><p>
I last read with attention your proposal for an experimental farm. The objects in view are certainly very interesting, and to a considerable degree attainable under 
the direction of such a manager as I suspect it would be more easy to describe than to find. It would probably be 
advisable to make him a band allowance percent, on the profits, besi vy.

This country will learn - from all your improvements relative to the breed and management of livestock. But I apprehend that, from the difference between 
your climate and ours, it will in some respects be less easy for us to apply and put into practice your improvements respecting the growth and cultivation of plants. 
</p><p>
In the year <a href='/results.php?year=1784'>1784</a>, I had an interesting conversation with 
one of your intelligent farmers in Essex. He was surprised that we in this country seldom sowed more than one 
bushel of wheal on an acre. On being told that in our good 
land one seed would produce many shoots or straws, he 
observed thai we had better sow an additional bushel, for 
thai these shoots were generally loss productive than single 
straws from single grains. On my return that year to this 
country, I mentioned the remark to some of our best 
farmers. One of them in particular gave it a fair trial for 
several years. He increased his seed in various experiments, from one bushel to above two bushels per acre ; but 
he finally found and was convinced that not more than one 
bushel and a half per acre could be sowed on his farm with 
advantage : any quantity above that filled the field with too 
much st 'aw. Hence I conclude that (all other tidings being equal) the sari iber of gi ains of seed wheat will throw out more shoots in this climate than in yours. 
</p><p>
But to return to the experimental farm: it appi -me that such an establishment comes naturally within the department of the agricultural society; and if instituted by 
them, would enjoy greater advantages, than such an establishment if entirely independent and distinct from th would posses.

The more food Great Britain produces, the better; and it is plain that by cultivating all your waste lands, and by 
still greater improvements in husbandry, the quantity annually produced may and will he exceedingly augmented ; 
yet, sir, it is not quite clear to me, that Great Britain can always continue to produce more food than she will consume. You now manufacture for about five millions of 
people in this country, and for many millions in other countries. Consider the rapidity of population in this country, 
and in some parts of your extensive empire. Your manufacturers must increase, and they must have food. On this 
topic much might be said, which will readily occur to you. 
With great respect and esteem, I am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,
