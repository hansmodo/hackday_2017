</p><p>
GENTLEMEN : 
</p><p>
In reply to your favor of yesterday you will permit me to 
waive any further discussion relative to the bill of Dallard 
and Swan. But while you have the security not only of the 
Treasury order upon them, but also the bill of Lubbert and Dumas, with yet another in case of urgent necessity, I do 
not consider the payment as in the smallest degree precarious. 
</p><p>
Upon what grounds Messrs. John and Francis Baring & 
Co. assured Mr. Hubbard, that the Treasury did not expect the funds sent for you would produce more than ninety 
per cent, and that such sales would be satisfactory, I know 
not. Such an assurance is certainly not inferable from any 
directions that either you or I have received from the Treasury Department. It is so far from being satisfactory to me 
under the instructions which I have received, that I should 
now request you in the most earnest manner to give immediate orders for the suspension of the sales upon such 
terms, but for the information in your last letter. The loss to the United States on these sales will be such as in my 
opinion can be warranted only by a conviction, founded upon substantial reasons, that it would not be disapproved by the 
Secretary of the Treasury. 
</p><p>
As the three hundred thousand florins, lately remitted 
you from the Treasury Department, were destined and appropriated among other purposes for the payment of the 
Antwerp interest, I believe that the part of the sum necessary for that operation cannot be applied to any other purpose whatever. 
</p><p>
You observe, that "the doctrine laid down by me relative 
to the payment you made of the last Antwerp interest established the propriety and justice of a debt first due having 
an undeniable right to be discharged prior to one falling due at a later period." 
</p><p>
This reference to a former occasion, upon which I had with 
regret an opinion different from yours, makes it necessary 
for me to observe that your present statement draws from 
what I then said an inference more extensive and general 
than I think the expressions will support. I contended that 
the government of the United States had the right to direct 
the application of any balance in the hands of their agents 
to such payments as they thought proper, that the agents 
had no authority to divert a special appropriation to the 
discharge of any other demand, and that if it should happen 
that a double appropriation were made of the same sum, it 
would then be incumbent on the agents to make payments 
according to their orders as they should be demanded, so long 
as their money lasted. 
</p><p>
To this opinion I still adhere; but I think it does not by 
any means involve any conclusion relative to the respective 
merits of a prior or a subsequent claim to the payment of a 
debt in general. 
</p><p>
I could not intend to advance an unqualified position that 
a debt first due has an undeniable right to be first paid, be 
cause I never had an idea that the principle, thus unlimited, 
had any foundation. There are a variety of circumstances, 
which may give a superior claim to the payment the most 
recently due. 
</p><p>
Of this matter I consider the demand for the payment of 
interest at its stipulated periods. Punctuality on this article is in general a more imperious duty of the debtor, because 
it is more essential to the convenience, and perhaps to the necessities, of the creditor. 
</p><p>
Your opinion in this respect appears to be the same ; as, 
although you have not paid the instalment of principal which 
became payable last June, you have paid considerable sums 
of interest, which have since that time become due. 
</p><p>
When therefore the government of the United States have 
made a particular remittance, with orders to you that it 
should be applied to the payment of certain interest, I do 
not think you have any authority to refuse making that application, and to employ the money for the payment of an instalment of principal, previously payable, and for the dis 
charge of which other ample funds were provided, though unfortunately they were in stocks. 
</p><p>
I must now request, gentlemen, your final and positive answer, whether you will supply Mr. De Wolf the sums 
necessary for the punctual payment of the interest upon the Antwerp loan payable in December. 
</p><p>
Whatever your decision may be, it will doubtless be such as you will justify to the government of the United States. 
</p><p>
I am under an inevitable necessity of answering the call which Mr. De Wolf has made on me, but shall ;yet suspend 
my answer until I receive yours. I am unwilling to write 
him that you chuse to make an application variant from your 
orders, of remittances lately made and destined for him. I 
am still more unwilling to give him the means of procuring 
the supply elsewhere, in a manner that will be burdensome to 
the United States ; and, indeed, I cannot recur to other re 
sources, without being first convinced that the supplies in 
your hands will fail. But the first of December is rapidly 
approaching, some provision for the payment of that day 
must be made, and as far as the means in my power extend, 
I am bound to use them all, if necessary to ensure a punctual discharge of interest. . . .
</p><p>
I am &c.
