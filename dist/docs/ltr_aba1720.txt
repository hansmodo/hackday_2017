</p><p>
DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RECEIVED yours of July 7th, for which I heartily 
thank you. It was the longest and best letter I have 
had ; the most leisurely, and therefore the most sentimental. Previous to your last, I had written you 
and made some complaints of you, but I will take them all back again. Only continue your obliging 
favors, whenever your time will allow you to devote one moment to your absent <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aba" rel="me">PORTIA</a>. 
</p><p>
This is the 25th of July. Gage has not made any attempts to march out since the battle at Charlestown. Our army is restless, and wish to be doing 
something to rid themselves and the land of the vermin and locusts which infest it. Since I wrote you last, the companies stationed upon the coast, both in 
this town, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>, and Hingham, were ordered 
to Nantasket, to reap and bring off the grain, which 
they accomplished, all except a field or two which 
was not ripe ; and having whaleboats, they under 
took to go to the Lighthouse and set fire to it, which 
they effected in open day, and in fair sight of several 
men-of-war. Upon their return, came down upon 
them eight barges, one cutter, and one schooner, all 
in battle array, and poured whole broad sides upon 
them ; but our men all reached the shore, and not 
one life lost, two only slightly wounded in their legs. 
They marched up a hill, and drew into order, in 
hopes the marines would land ; but they chose rather 
to return without a land engagement, though t'is 
thought they will burn the town down as soon as our 
forces leave it. I had this account from Captain Vinton, who with his company were there. These 
little skirmishes seem trifling, but they serve to inure 
our men, and harden them to danger. I hear the 
rebels are very wroth at the destruction of the light house. 
</p><p>
There has been an offer from Gage to send the 
poor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> to Salem by water, but not complied 
with on our part ; they returned for answer, they 
would receive them upon the lines. Dr. Tufts saw 
a letter from Deacon Newall, in which he mentions 
the death of John Cotton ; he says it is very sickly in 
town. Every fishing vessel is now obliged to enter 
and clear out, as though she was going a foreign 
voyage. No inhabitant is suffered to partake, but 
obliged to wait till the army is supplied, and then, if 
one remains, they are allowed to purchase it. An 
order has been given out in town, that no person 
shall be seen to wipe his face with a white hand 
kerchief. The reason I hear is, that it is a signal of 
mutiny. General Burgoyne lives in Mr. Sam Quincy's house. A lady, who lived opposite, says she 
saw raw meat cut and hacked upon her mahogany 
tables, and her superb damask curtain and cushions 
exposed to the rain as if they were of no value. 
How much better do the Tories fare than the Whigs? 
I suppose this worthy, good man was put in with all 
confidence that nothing should be hurt. 
</p><p>
I was very much pleased with <a href="/results.php?tla=chl" rel="">General Lee's</a> letter, and really entertained a more favorable opinion 
of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhb" rel="adversary">Burgoyne</a> than I before had imbibed from his 
speech ; but a late letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, written to Mr. Josiah Quincy, and, in case of his absence, to be 
opened either by you or <a href="/results.php?tla=sam" rel="">Mr. Samuel Adams</a>, or either 
of the Warrens, has left me no room to think that he is possessed either of generosity, virtue, or humanity. His character runs thus ; 
</p><p>
"As to Burgoyne, I am not master of language 
sufficient to give you a true idea of the horrible 
wickedness of the man. His designs are dark ; his 
dissimulation of the deepest dye ; for, not content 
with deceiving mankind, he practises deceit on God 
himself, by assuming the appearance (like Hutchinson) of great attention to religious worship, when 
every action of his life is totally abhorrent to all 
ideas of true religion, virtue, or common honesty. 
An abandoned, infamous gambler, of broken fortune, 
and the worst and most detestable of the Bedford 
gang, who are wholly bent on blood, tyranny, and 
spoil, and therefore the darling favorite of our unrivalled ruler, Lord Bute." 
</p><p>
The character of Howe is not drawn much more favorably, but Clinton's general character very good, and tis said he does not relish the service he is sent 
upon. I am ready to believe this of Clinton, as I have never heard of any speeches of his since his arrival, nor scarcely any mention of him. That 
such characters as <a href="/results.php?tla=jhb" rel="adversary">Burgoyne</a> and Howe should engage in such a cause is not to be wondered at ; but it 
is really to be lamented, when a man, possessed of one spark of virtue, should be drawn aside, and disgrace himself and posterity by adding one more to 
the already infamous list. I suppose you have heard 
of Darby's arrival, and the intelligence he brings. I could not refrain wishing them everlasting fetters ; "the news received with some symptoms of pleasure," and " our friends increased," and a few more 
such sugar plums. Were they suffering as we are, could Americans sit thus coldly whilst Britons were bleeding? How is it possible, that the love of gain 
and the lust of domination should render the human mind so callous to every principle of honor, generosity, and benevolence? 
</p><p>
May that day be far distant from America, when 
" trade's unfeeling train," shall " usurp this land, 
and dispossess the swain." 
</p><p>
" 111 fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, 
Where wealth accumulates, and men decay ; 
Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade ; 
A breath can make them, as a breath has made ; 
But a bold peasantry, their country's pride, 
When once destroyed, can never be supplied." 
</p><p>
Your address meets with general approbation here ; your petitioning the King again, pleases (forgive me if I say the timid and the weak) those persons who 
were esteemed the lukewarm, and who think no works of supererogation can be performed to Great Britain ; whilst others say you heap coals of fire 
upon the heads of your enemies. You know you are considered here as a most perfect body ; if one member is by any means rendered incapable of acting, t'is supposed the deficiency will be made up. 
The query is, why your President left the Congress so long as to make it necessary to choose another member, whether he declined returning to you again? 
</p><p>
I suppose you have a list of our Council. It was generally thought that Gage would make an attempt to come out either Election day, or upon the Fast ; 
but I could not believe we should be disturbed upon that day. Even " the devils believe and tremble," and I really believe they are more afraid of the Americans prayers than of their swords. I could not bear 
to hear our inanimate old bachelor. Mrs. Cranch and I took our chaise and. went to hear Mr. Haven, of Declham, and we had no occasion to repent eleven 
miles ride ; especially as I had the pleasure of spending the day with my namesake and sister delegate. Why should we not assume your titles when we give 
you up our names? I found her comfortably situated in a little country cottage, with patience, perseverance, and fortitude for her companions, and in better health than she has enjoyed for many months past. 
</p><p>
I fear General Thomas being overlooked, and <a href="/results.php?tla=wih" rel="">Heath</a> placed over him, will create much uneasiness. I know not who was to blame, but it is likely to 
make a great and fatal gap in the army. If Thomas resigns, all his officers resign ; and Mr. Thomas cannot with honor hold under Heath. The camp 
will evince to every eye how good an officer he has been ; but this is out of my sphere. I only say what others say, and what the general disposition of the people is. 
</p><p>
I need not say how much I want to see you, but no one will credit my story of your returning in a month. I hope to have the best of proofs to convince them. 
</p><p>
It cannot need any to convince you how sincerely 
I am your affectionate 
</p><p>
