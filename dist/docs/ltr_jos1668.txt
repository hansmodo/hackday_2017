My Dear Brother: We have been eagerly watching 
the course of military events. Here nothing occurs 
worth noting. If there is any change, it is for the 
better. The tone of popular opinion is more patriotic. 
There are fewer noisy Butternuts, and most of these 
think their bad talk is only fair opposition to the administration. The only /danger is that this will become 
downright opposition^ resistance to the war and the laws 
where mobs and civijl war will be the inevitable result. 
A good many scary people are afraid of this, but I am 
too well accustomed to violent political quarrels to look 
for danger from them. There may be occasional mobs, 
as there were the other day at Fort Wayne, where I made 
a speech, but both parties pledged themselves to the 
war and only differed about the "nigger" and administration measures. The difference may widen, and unless 
we have decided military success, will widen until we 
have open and hostile war and peace parties. Then 
God knows what will be the result. One tendency I 
noticed. Nearly every man in debt is paying off his 
debts. The inflation of the currency and the rise of 
property make this easy. Unluckily for me, most of my 
means is or was "in bills receivable." These are paid, 
or will be, and so I find myself with plenty of money, 
but can't buy anything at reasonable prices. This is 
the general rule of creditors, and perhaps it is better so 
for the community, as the creditor class can more easily 
bear the loss of inflation. There is nothing in the condition at all discouraging except our military condition. 
This I confess looks discouraging. The defeat of Hooker, 
of which as yet we have not full particulars, is a terrible 
event. Experience should have taught us not to hope 
much from his army, and yet the impression was so 
strong after his confident assertions and his promising 
commencement that we all feel the disappointment. It 
is gloomy. Still what can we do, but fight on. ...

I regret to notice from your letter that Grant's recent 
movements do not meet your approval. It was regarded 
as a bold and successful plan to turn the flank of the 
enemy, but if he is weaker from the south side of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> than from above, I do not see what we have 
gained. We have a telegraphic account of your recent attack on Haines Bluff, but do not understand its 
purpose. 
</p><p>
As for the consolidation of regiments, it is idle for 
me to interpose. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> regulates all these matters. 
He is king in all questions regulating the detail affecting the army. Stanton has far less power than Halleck, 
and, indeed, holds office by a frail tenure and with 
limited influence. It is no use for a civilian to talk to 
Halleck. He would regard your opinion, but certainly 
not mine, though we are good friends. You have been 
sagacious in your anticipation of military events. 
Charleston is not taken, the war is prolonged, and but 
little chance of its ending until we have a new deal. 
</p><p>
If only the people will be patient so long, all will be 
well. The best of it is, they can't help themselves. 
The rebels won't let us have peace even if we wanted it. 
It may be better that the Democrats be allowed to take 
the helm, as they could not make peace, and then war 
would be more vigorous and united. . . . 
</p><p>
This war has always seemed to me a tragic necessity. 
I have watched its progress, and hope to see its termination. It may, like the French Revolution, travel in 
a large circle, destroying all that have taken part in it ; 
still there is no way but to go ahead. We may slowly 
learn wisdom in its prosecution, for we certainly have 
not shown it thus far. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother,
