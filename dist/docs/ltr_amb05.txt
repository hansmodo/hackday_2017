Dear Hans,<br><br>
Thanks for the letter awhile back. I am a bit slow in response, but there have
definitely been periods in my life when I never wrote any at all... too busy, I guess.
So don't worry about writing back, etc. When you feel like being in touch, fine.<br><br>
You mentioned your Aunt Cathy in your last letter. I don't know anything about your mom's family
or her relationship with Cathy. I do know that sometimes things can happen that cause people to become 
estranged from one another. In your life ( hell, in everyone's life ) there are factors that could have been
handled a number of ways. Your mom had a very tough hand to play after the accident that left her so 
disabled. I don't know what happened... except for secondhand gossip via Bonnie. I do not have much respect
for Bonnie, or any of her opinions about anything. So you might say that I do not know much about the history
of Gail's life, and therefore your life.<br><br>
I don't know if your mom suffered brain damage, but I would think that's possible. I would want to know that, if she
were my mom. I wrote Heidi about that very topic, because it is easier for me to deal with the truth than with speculation.
Whatever your mom was before the accident, or is now, she is still your mom. The two of you have every right to decide
as adults how you wish to interact with her. In terms of your own feelings and in moving toward resolution of past
( and possibly present ) pain, it would be important to be as honest as you can. Brain damaged people should not be
evaluated by the same standards as healthy people. They simply do not have the physiological capacity to reason
and behave as a healthy individual. To expect otherwise is to set yourself up for disappointment, pain, and anger.
This also causes pain for the "patient", because they do have feelings, and can perceive, in differing levels, there
own inability to function. I sense that a lot has gone on between your aunt and your mom. I don't know what is going
on with Heidi. Some people choose to face the truth head on and some people would rather hide, or wait until times feel
safer. I have always been the type to want the truth.<br><br>
Are you back in school? I may go to various cities to explore psychiatry residencies. My court case is likely to wind
down soon. Winter is coming again... didn't we just have one? I spent 16 years in the South, where winter was just another
thing that happened to "Yankees".<br><br>
Take care. Study hard. Don't worry about the national government; Hillary Rodham Clinton is doing a good job.<br><br>
Love,<br>
