DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am requested, by the Board of Admiralty, to inform your Excellency that they have in contemplation an expedition with several of their frigates, which 
will require three or four hundred land forces to act 
in conjunction, and who may act as marines when on 
board, which will obviate the great difficulty of pro 
curing men for the ships. They wish to be informed 
if the men can be spared from the army. They will 
be wanted to embark (probably at New London) by 
the middle of April, for an expedition of about two months. If seamen can be drafted, they will be much 
preferable to other troops. 
</p><p>
From the injury I have received in my leg, and 
the great stiffness in my ankle, my surgeons are of 
opinion it will not be prudent for me to take a command in the army for some time to come. As I 
wish to render my country every service in my 
power, I have offered the Board to take the command 
of the expedition, provided it is agreeable to your Excellency, and the men can be spared from the army; in which case, I shall soon have the honor of 
laying the plan before your Excellency, and believe 
you will think it an object of importance. 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from Major Clarkson, dated <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, January 30th, who writes me, 
that " the fleet which sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in December, are certainly arrived and arriving at <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> ; their force uncertain, but very large." Two 
of our frigates have captured a brigantine, with clothing, and two sloops, with dragoons of Lord Cathcart's 
legion, who have saved only two horses of forty-five. 
The fleet were dispersed in a few days after they 
sailed, and greatly injured by several storms. 
</p><p>
I suppose your Excellency will receive particular information from Congress. I have the honor to be, 
with great respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
Affectionate and obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
