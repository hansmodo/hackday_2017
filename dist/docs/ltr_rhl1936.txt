My LORD The wisdom and goodness, with which your lordship has patronised America, claims the reverence of all its inhabitants. As an individual of this 
country I am greatly honoured by any service that will 
be acceptable to your lordship; and now take the liberty 
to send you a Virginia almanac, and the last Virginia 
Gazette, containing the proceedings of our late Assembly. These proceedings rny lord, may, to some, appear the overflowings of a seditious and disloyal madness : 
but your lordship's just and generous attachment to the 
proper rights and liberty of mankind, will discover in 
them, nothing more than a necessary and manly assertion, of social privileges founded in reason, guaranteed 
by the English constitution, and rendered sacred by a 
possession of near two hundred years, that is, my lord, 
from the first settlement of North America, until a late 
period. When your lordship afforded the Americans 
your protection, it was given to a people, who are certainly loyal, very warmly attached to their mother country, and who wish its prosperity, with unfeigned heartiness. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, your lordship's 
</p><p>
most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
