My Darling.
</p><p>
Do you query how it happens that I am writing you from this place?
</p><p>
I had not time to write the day before I left Wakeman.
</p><p>
Yesterday morning Lucy and I came here and brought baby with us - we took baby hoping to get her picture and also to have the Dr. examine her back and one of her legs that mother thought were not straight. He said the legs were all right - and that there is between the shoulders the least bit of spinal curvature, but he says it is not enough to call for any treatment, will do her no harm and will probably be outgrown.
</p><p>
Our attempts to get baby's picture entirely failed - I tried to get a large photograph. She was afraid as soon as they began to push the camera toward her and we could do nothing with her. - I am very sorry and still remain so because I think we shall be unable to get one at present for I think she will be afraid and cry.
</p><p>
I shall not again take her out of town to try it.
</p><p>
Now must give a little explanation of my prolonged stay here. I came here to consult Lucy's Dr. Sanders for myself. He made an examination and told me that there was ulceration and that it had been of long standing - he also thought that if I remained here for a few days that he could help me sufficiently so that I could treat myself through the summer without further medical aid. So after consulting with Lucy I decided to remain until Monday (I came Thursday) and possibly a day or two longer and send baby home with Lucy - I felt very unwilling to do it - and yet on looking the whole matter over it seemed best. He tells me that he sees no reason why I should not become entirely well and strong, but that the ulceration left to itself will gradually debilitate me. He found me a boarding place at the Private Homeopathic Hospital near by his office. It is a very pleasant spot but few boarders chiefly ladies and a pleasant matron. I have a large room on the first floor. board only $6.00 per week. Please tell me when you write what you think of my decision - This expense will make me rather short of money but I decided to risk it. If this reaches you in [...] you can, if convenient, add a little to what I rent for, if not I will manage with what I have.
</p><p>
It will of course prevent me from having any picture of myself taken, but if the actual wife can thereby grow strong I do not think you will complain - address my letter to Wakeman as follows on shall return there first on middle of the week. I do hope much from any treatment and shall do all in my power toward recovery. I had a very pleasant ride this morning through the city with Dr. Sanders. I went to his office for treatment and after it he invited me to go with him while he went to visit his patients. I so seldom take a drive in other than some stupid public conveyance that it was quite a treat to me.
</p><p>
It was very odd to be without baby last night and I don't think I slept as well as I would have done with her - It is not yet 11:30 A.M. and yet the day seems already to have been long though I have been to the office and to drive I go to the Dr.'s office for treatment between 8 and 9 in the morning and about 8 at night - I wish you were with me daily and I do very much hope to be quite well and strong when you see me at Christmas - Please destroy this letter because I do not think it wise to keep letters that speak of disease of a intimate nature.
</p><p>
And now goodbye Darling - May God keep us,
</p><p>
