Tonight at eight o'clock accompanied Mrs. Polk and the other ladies of the family to the residence of General Thomas H. Benton in this city, and witnessed the marriage of his eldest daughter, Miss Eliza Benton, with Mr. Jones of New Orleans. I waited on the bride to the supper table and shortly after supper I retired and returned to the President's mansion, leaving Mrs. Polk and Mr. and Mrs. Walker and Miss Rucker enjoying themselves with the bridal company.
