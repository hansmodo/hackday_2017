HONOURED MAMMA : 
</p><p>
As you have ordered me in a letter, which I have lately 
received, to give you my observations on the countries thro which I have travelled, the following are some upon 
Russia ; but, I must previously beg you will remember, that you say in your letter that you expect neither the 
precision of a Robertson, nor the elegance of a Voltaire ; therefore, you must take them as they are. 
</p><p>
The government of Russia is entirely despotical ; the sovereign is absolute in all the extent of the word. The 
persons, the estates, the fortunes of the nobility depend entirely upon his caprice. And the nobility have the same 
power over the people, that the sovereign has over them. 
</p><p>
The nation is wholly composed of nobles and serfs, or, in other words, of masters and slaves. The countryman is 
attached to the land in which he is born ; if the land is sold, he is sold with it, and he is obliged to give to his land 
lord the portion of his time which he chooses to demand. It is commonly two days in the week, I think. Others 
make them pay a sort of tax, of two or three rubles a year. (N.B. that a ruble is four shillings sterling, or thereabouts.) 
This makes a large revenue for the landlords, if they have a great number of serfs, and there are some of the nobles 
who have an amazing quantity of them. Out of each five hundred they are obliged to furnish one to the Empress 
every year, and this forms her army. I have been assured from good authority, that there is one nobleman who 
furnishes 1300 men a year to the Empress. According to 
that the number of his slaves would be 650,000. Supposing each of these slaves pay him a ruble a year his revenue will be more than 100,000 Sterling per annum.

This form of government is disadvantageous to the 
sovereign, to the nobles and to the people, For first, it 
exposes the sovereign every moment to revolution, of which 
there have been already four in the course of this century; vizt. when Anne, Dutchess of Courland, was set upon the 
throne, which was the right of Elizabeth, daughter of 
Peter the first. This was done by some noblemen, who 
wanted to limit the prerogatives of the sovereign, and be 
more powerful themselves. And they thought they would 
find Anne more ready to agree to their stipulations than 
Elizabeth, because she had no right to the crown ; but 
she soon overturned all their schemes. For as soon as she 
found herself well seated upon the throne, she rendered herself absolute, by reinstating the ancient form of government, and banished all those who had made these restrictions. This was the second revolution. The third was 
when Elizabeth dethroned Ivan^ an infant of six months 
old, and had him shut up in a tower, where he lived twenty 
years, and was then murdered in it. And the 4th, when 
Peter the third was dethroned by the present Empress. This, I think, is sufficient proof that the government is 
disadvantageous for the sovereign. Secondly, as the nobles 
all depend wholly upon the sovereign, they are always in 
danger of their estates being confiscated and themselves 
sent into Siberia. It is commonly the fate of the favorites. MenzicofT, the Dolgorouckis, Biren, Bestucheff, Osterman, 
L Estocq, all these have been the sport of fortune, for some time the favorites of the Emperors, and then sent to Siberia 
into exile, there to live in misery. The history of Menzicoff 
is the most extraordinary, and he did not deserve the fate. 
He was born at Moscow. He was of low extraction, and 
used to carry about the streets, while a child, pies, and sing 
ballads. Peter the first saw him several times, and asked 
him several questions. His answers pleased him so much 
that he took him to the Palace, and, by degrees, he became 
the favorite of the Emperor, who gave him the title of 
Prince, and made him General of his Army, etc. At the 
battle of Pultowa, he saved the Empire, because a manoeuvre of his was the means of the battle's being decided in favor 
of the Emperor. During the whole reign of Peter the ist and that of Catherine, he was high in power, but, under that of Peter the 2d, he was stripped of all his dignities, 
his fortune, which was immense, was confiscated, and himself sent into exile, where he died in misery. This is very 
nearly the history of all the others. An author, who has 
written upon Russia, (Mannstein's Memoirs of Russia) 
says he has seen lands change masters three or four times 
in the course of a year. This is certainly not advantageous 
for the nobility. And, thirdly, as to the people nobody, I 
believe, will assert that a people can be happy who are 
subjected to personal slavery. Some of these serfs are 
immensely rich, but they are not free, and, therefore, they 
are despised ; besides they depend still upon the nobles, 
who make them contribute the more for their riches. A 
nobleman wants money. If he has any rich serfs, he sends 
and lets one of them know that he must have, at such a 
time, a thousand rubles (more or less, according to circumstances). This the serf has a right to refuse, but in that case his landlord orders him to go and work upon 
such a piece of ground, so he is obliged either to give the money, or to go and work. The richer they are, the more the nobles prize them. Thus a common man costs but 80 
or 100 rubles, at most; but I have seen a man, who gave to his landlord, for his liberty, and that of his descendants, 
450,000 rubles. This proves the esteem they have for liberty, even where one would think they should not know that such a thing exists.

As I am a little pressed for time, and as my letter has already run to a considerable length, I must, for the present 
</p><p>
subscribe myself, 
</p><p>
Your most dutiful son.
