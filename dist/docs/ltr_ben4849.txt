MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I am just returned from a Journey of near a Month, which 
has given a new Spring to my Health and Spirits. I did not 
get home in time to write by Osborne, but shall fully to my 
Friends in general by Cap. All, who sails about the End of 
the Week. 
</p><p>
I was charg'd with Abundance of Love to you and Sally 
and Ben from our Sister Bache and her amiable Daughters. 
I spent some Days at Preston, visited several Friends in 
Cumberland, Westmoreland, Yorkshire, and Staffordshire. 
</p><p>
Rachel Wilson sent her Love to you and our Children, as did 
our remaining Relations at Birmingham, where I likewise 
staied several Days. In Cumberland I ascended a very high 
Mountain, where I had a Prospect of a most beautiful Country, of Hills, Fields, Lakes, Villas, &c. and at Whitehaven 
went down the Coal mines till they told me I was 80 Fathoms 
under the Surface of the Sea, which roll'd over our Heads; 
so that I have been nearer both the upper and lower Regions 
than ever in my Life before. My Love to our Children, 
and all enquiring Friends. I am ever, my dear Debby, your 
affectionate Husband, R FRANKLIN>
