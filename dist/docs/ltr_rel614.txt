<p> <i>[Biographer's Note: Lucy Long was my father's mare, which had been lost or stolen at the end
of the war, and which I had just brought back to him.  I will give
in the following letter his account of her:]</i>

                            Lexington, Virginia, September 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1866">1866</a>.

Dear Sir:  I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 23d ult.
and the information it contained.  The mare about which my son wrote
you was bred by Mr. Stephen Dandridge, of 'The Bower,' Berkeley County,
Virginia, and was purchased from him for me by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jes" rel="co-worker met">General J. E. B. Stuart</a>
in the fall of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>--after the return of the army from Maryland.  She
is nine or ten years old, about fifteen hands high, square built,
sorrel (not chestnut) colour, has a fast walk, easy pace, and short
canter.  When I parted with her she had a full long mane and tail.  I
rode her in conjunction with my gray horse from the fall of '62 to
the spring of '64, when she was sent back for refreshment; and it was
in recalling her in the spring of '65 from Mr. Hairston's, in Henry
County, that she got into Major Paxton's stables of public horses and
went to Danville with them.  I think she might be recognised by any
member of the Army of Northern Virginia, in Essex, unless much changed.
I now recollect no distinctive marks about her except a blaze in her
forehead and white hind-legs.  My son, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfl" rel="child met">General W. H. F. Lee</a>, residing
at the White House, in New Kent, might recognise her, and also my
son Robert, who resides near West Point, in King William.  Captain
Hopkins, to whom you refer in your letter, is dead, but Major Paxton,
who had general charge of the public stables, and to whom I referred
you letter, has sent me the accompanying affidavits of two of the
men employed by him.  Should their evidence not be satisfactory, he
will procure statements from some of the officers, which probably
may be more definite.  I should be obliged to you, if the mare in
question is the one I am seeking for, that you would take steps to
recover her, as I am desirous of reclaiming her in consideration of
the donor, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jes" rel="co-worker met">General Stuart</a>.
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>
</p>

<p><i>[Biographer's Note: It was proved to the satisfaction of all parties that the mare in
question was Lucy Long, and my father reimbursed the man who had
bought her from some one who had no right to her.  She was brought
to my place and I recognised her at once.  She stayed with me until
I was ready to pay my Christmas visit to Lexington.  She then was put
on the train and sent to Staunton, where I met her.  I found there
Colonel William Allan, a professor of Washington College, who had a
buggy and no horse, and as I had a horse and no buggy, we joined forces
and I drove him over to Lexington, Lucy Long carrying us with great
ease to herself and comfort to us.  My father was glad to get her, as
he was very fond of her.  When he heard how she came over, he was
really shocked, as he thought she had never been broken to harness.
She lived to be thirty-three years old, and was then chloroformed,
because my brother thought she had ceased to enjoy life.  For the last
ten years of her life she was boarded out in the country, where she
did nothing but rest, and until about a year before her death she
seemed in good health and spirits. ]</i>
