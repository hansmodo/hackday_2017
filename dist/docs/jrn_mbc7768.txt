<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='26'>26th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Mrs. Munroe offered me religious books, which I declined, being already provided with the 
Lamentations of Jeremiah, the Psalms of David, the denunciations of Hosea, and, above all, the patient wail of Job. 
Job is my comforter now. I should be so thankful to know life never would be any worse with me. My husband is 
well, and has been ordered to join the great Retreater. I am bodily comfortable, if somewhat dingily lodged, and I 
daily part with my raiment for food. We find no one who will exchange eatables for Confederate money; so we are devouring our clothes. 
</p><p>
Opportunities for social enjoyment are not wanting. Miss Middleton and Isabella often drink a cup of tea with 
me. One might search the whole world and not find two cleverer or more agreeable women. Miss Middleton is brilliant and accomplished. She must have been a hard student all her life. She knows everybody worth knowing, and she 
has been everywhere. Then she is so high-bred, high-hearted, pure, and true. She is so clean-minded ; she could not 
harbor a wrong thought. She is utterly unselfish, a devoted 
daughter and sister. She is one among the many large-brained women a kind Providence has thrown in my way, 
such as Mrs. McCord, daughter of Judge Cheves; Mary Preston Darby, Mrs. Emory, granddaughter of old Franklin, the American wise man, and Mrs. Jefferson Davis. How I love to praise my friends ! 
</p><p>
As a ray of artificial sunshine, Mrs. Munroe sent me an Examiner. Daniel thinks we are at the last gasp, and now England and France are bound to step in. England must know if the United States of America are triumphant they 
will tackle her next, and France must wonder if she will not have to give up Mexico. My faith fails me. It is all too 
late ; no help for us now from God or man. 
</p><p>
Thomas, Daniel says, was now to ravage Georgia, but <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a>, from all accounts, has done that work once for all. 
There will be no aftermath. They say no living thing is found in <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> track, only chimneys, like telegraph 
poles, to carry the news of <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> army backward. 
</p><p>
In all that tropical down-pour, Mrs. Munroe sent me overshoes and an umbrella, with the message, Come over." 
I went, for it would be as well to drown in the streets as to hang myself at home to my own bedpost. At Mrs. Munroe's 
I met a Miss McDaniel. Her father, for seven years, was the Methodist preacher at our negro church. The negro 
church is in a grove just opposite Mulberry house. She says her father has so often described that fine old establishment and its beautiful lawn, live-oaks, etc. Now, I dare say there stand at Mulberry only <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> sentinels 
stacks of chimneys. We have made up our minds for the worst. Mulberry house is no doubt razed to the ground. 
</p><p>
Miss McDaniel was inclined to praise us. She said: " As a general rule the Episcopal minister went to the 
family mansion, and the Methodist missionary preached to the negroes and dined with the overseer at his house, but at 
Mulberry her father always stayed at the House, and the family were so kind and attentive to him." It was 
rather pleasant to hear one's family so spoken of among strangers. 
</p><p>
So, well equipped to brave the weather, armed cap-a-pie, so to speak, I continued my prowl farther afield and 
brought up at the Middletons . I may have surprised them, for at such an inclement season they hardly expected a 
visitor. Never, however, did lonely old woman receive such 
a warm and hearty welcome. Now we know the worst. Are we growing hardened ? We avoid all allusion to Columbia ; 
we never speak of home, and we begin to deride the certain poverty that lies ahead. 
</p><p>
How it pours ! Could I live many days in solitary confinement? Things are beginning to be unbearable, but I 
must sit down and be satisfied. My husband is safe so far. Let me be thankful it is no worse with me. But there is the 
gnawing pain all the same. What is the good of being here at all. Our world has simply gone to destruction. And 
across the way the fair Lydia languishes. She has not even my resources against ennui. She has no Isabella, no Miss 
Middleton, two as brilliant women as any in Christendom. Oh, how does she stand it ! I mean to go to church if it 
rains cats and dogs. My feet are wet two or three times a day. We never take cold ; our hearts are too hot within us 
for that. 
</p><p>
A carriage was driven up to the door as I was writing. I began to tie on my bonnet, and said to myself in the glass, 
Oh, you lucky woman ! I was all in a tremble, so great 
was my haste to be out of this. Mrs. Glover had the carriage. She came for me to go and hear Mr. Martin preach. 
He lifts our spirits from this dull earth ; he takes us up to heaven. That I will not deny. Still he can not hold my attention; my heart wanders and my mind strays back to South Carolina. Oh, vandal <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> ! what are you at 
there, hard-hearted wretch that you are ! A letter from General Chesnut, who writes from camp near Charlotte under 
date of February 28th : 
</p><p>
" I thank you a thousand, thousand times for your kind letters. They are now my only earthly comfort, except the 
hope that all is not yet lost. We have been driven like a wild herd from our country. And it is not from a want of 
spirit in the people or soldiers, nor from want of energy and competency in our commanders. The restoration of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a>, it is hoped, will redound to the advantage 
of our cause and the reestablishment of our fortunes! I am still in not very agreeable circumstances. For the last 
four days completely water-bound. 
</p><p>
" I am informed that a detachment of Yankees were sent from Liberty Hill to Camden with a view to destroying 
all the houses, mills, and provisions about that place. No particulars have reached me. You know I expected the 
worst that could be done, and am fully prepared for any report which may be made. 
</p><p>
" It would be a happiness beyond expression to see you even for an hour. I have heard nothing from my poor old 
father. I fear I shall never see him again. Such is the fate of war. I do not complain. I have deliberately chosen my 
lot, and am prepared for any fate that awaits me. My care is for you, and I trust still in the good cause of my country and the justice and mercy of God. 
</p><p>
It was a lively, rushing, young set that South Carolina put to the fore. They knew it was a time of imminent danger, and that the fight would be ten to one. They expected to win by activity, energy, and enthusiasm. Then came the 
wet blanket, the croakers ; now, these are posing, wrapping Caesar's mantle about their heads to fall with dignity. 
Those gallant youths who dashed so gaily to the front lie mostly in bloody graves. Well for them, maybe. There 
are worse things than honorable graves. Wearisome thoughts. Late in life we are to begin anew and have laborious, difficult days ahead. 
</p><p>
We have contradictory testimony. Governor Aiken has passed through, saying <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> left Columbia as he found 
it, and was last heard from at Cheraw. Dr. Chisolm walked home with me. He says that is the last version of the story. 
Now my husband wrote that he himself saw the fires which burned up Columbia, The first night his camp was near 
enough to the town for that. 
</p><p>
They say <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> has burned Lancaster that <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> nightmare, that ghoul, that hyena ! But I do not believe it. He takes his time. There are none to molest him. 
</p><p>
He does things leisurely and deliberately. Why stop to do so needless a thing as burn Lancaster court-house, the 
jail, and the tavern? As I remember it, that description covers Lancaster. A raiding party they say did for 
Camden. 
</p><p>
No train from Charlotte yesterday. Rumor says <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> is in Charlotte.
