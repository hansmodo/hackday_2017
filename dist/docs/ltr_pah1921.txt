Your letter from Belleview came to hand, my dear sir, by the last post, & I assure you I wish all your letters may be as long. As usual I am in 
great hurry, & seize a moment by this Messenger to tell you that the necessity of adopting vigorous measures in the Comissariate induced me to appoint 
Hawkins, over whom I exerted all my personal Influence, & with great difficulty got him to under take the Business. He has given one-half his 
salary, which appears at first view large, to an able hand (R d . Morris) who is a fine accountant & man 
of Fortune. I am really shocked at the management of Congress in this .Department. John Moore's appointment gave me the most painful feelings. 
Good God ! Our Fate committed to a man utterly unable to perform the task assigned him ! Raw, inexperienced, without weight, consequence or acquaintance with men or business; called into action 
at a time when distinguished talent only can save an army from perishing. I tell you, &&amp;gt; I grieve at 
it, Congress will lose the respect due but I forbear. Tis my business to exert all my powers for the Common Good. I must not be depended on 
for anything in that line if Hawkins is rejected by congress. If he is continued, pray supply him with 
plenty of money. He is really superior to any one in that way, & of established credit to any amount. I've advanced money, & published repeated 
orders for the march of the new Levys, &&amp;gt; on receipt of yours have addressed the continental Officers on the subject. But there is great Langor 
among them. I've sought for good hands to set out on the recruiting Business you mention, & will make an effort, & by the success of that shall judge 
if any thing can be done. Gilmour, I think, ought to be dealt with, but the powers of the Executive will not reach so far as the seizing of papers. Tis 
indeed too much cramped. However will think further on the subject. I am really so harrassed by the great load of continental Business thrown on 
me lately, that I am ready to sink under my Burden, & have thoughts of taking that rest that will I doubt soon become necessary. For my strength will not 
suffice. You are again traduced by a certain set who have drawn in others, who say that you are engaged in a scheme to discard <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met"></a>. I know 
you too well to suppose you attempt any thing not evidently calculated to serve the cause of Whiggism. To dismiss the General would not be so : ergo &c. 
But it is your fate to suffer the constant attacks of disguised Torys who take this measure to lessen you. Farewell my dear Friend. In praying for your 
welfare I pray for that of my country, to which your life and service are of the last moment.
