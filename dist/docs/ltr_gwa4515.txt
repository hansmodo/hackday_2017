Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have only time to acknowledge the receipt of your Honor of the 8th instant and to congratulate you on your fortunate escape ; which is attended with the more 
flattering circumstances, from its being effected entirely by your own presence of mind. As the remaining part of Colonel Cortlandt's regiment is now ordered to 
join the main army, I have given directions to <a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a> to leave with you a small guard of men, 
who are the least capable of active service. The commissary will have orders to replace the rum, which you 
have borrowed for the public service, as soon as our 
circumstances will conveniently admit. At present 
there is not enough to satisfy the most pressing necessities of the service. With great respect and esteem, I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p>
