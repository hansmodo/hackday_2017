My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have just a minute to beg the favor of you to send my watch by Col. Tilghman : Messrs. <a href="/results.php?tla=ccp" rel="met co-worker">Pinckney</a> and <a href="/results.php?tla=peh" rel="met co-worker">Horry</a> arriv'd here yesterday, but they could not 
inform me certainly whether you had employ'd Hunt to buy me a horse. I am exceedingly in want of a vigorous steed that can gallop and leap well, not 
younger than four, but I would rather have him of six or seven years of age. Your kindness will excuse my hurry and the trouble I give. The gentlemen 
above mention'd gave me pleasure in informing me that you were well. Col. Tilghman will answer any questions respecting the motions of the enemy and our own. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
</p><p>
