TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 
</p><p>
Camp, near <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city origin'>Peekskill</a>, <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27</a> <a rel="month origin" value="6">June</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of receiving your Excellency's 
favor of the 23d instant from <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>. It would have 
given me the greatest pleasure could I have made it 
convenient to meet you at Newtown ; but independently of many arrangements, which are necessary at 
the first taking of the field, I am detained by the hourly 
expectation of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a>. I am 
pleased to find, that your idea of the position, which 
will be proper for the troops under your command, coincides exactly with my own ; and I shall be happy in 
giving your quartermaster-general every assistance in 
reconnoitering and marking out your camp. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant-Colonel Cobb, one of my aids-de-camp, 
will have the honor of delivering to you this letter, and 
will return to me with any despatch or message, which 
your Excellency may wish to communicate ; or, should 
you rather incline to come forward from Newtown 
before the army. Colonel Cobb will be proud to attend 
you. I shall be much obliged if your Excellency will 
present to the Count de Barras, by the next occasion, 
my sincere thanks for the readiness with which he was 
pleased to accept the proposition I had the honor to 
make to him through your Excellency. I am, &c. 
</p>
