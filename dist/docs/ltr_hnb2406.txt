MY DEAR WIFE : As I expected when I wrote last from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, this day fortnight, I have found my 
reception in this city easy and undisturbed. I have been here a week last Wednesday, having arrived the 
5th inst. I hope .you received that letter to prepare you for a just reception of the accounts that must 
reach you by the papers of a rising at <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, of which my effigy only was one of the objects. 
</p><p>
I am much teased by various causes of detention here which I can not control. The arrangement of my pecuniary claims on <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Col. Burr</a>, and the acquisition of slaves, neither of them yet effected, are the principal. It is un 
certain still how soon I can even hope to leave this town. Many motives incite me to go round by sea, in a fine vessel, with Bollman and other agreeable passengers, to sail about the middle of next week ; for there are reasons why I should not even appear at Marietta, though so many demands call thither. But I yet think that will be my course. I receive the most friendly attentions from my friends, the Lewises, and others. 
</p><p>
To-morrow I dine with Mr. Pollock, a gentleman of fortune and great respectability, where <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Col. Burr</a> has taken up his quarters. I wonder you have not yet drawn upon J. S. Lewis, for any sum not exceeding $500, 
through Harding. I am at a loss to conceive what you have resorted to, particularly as you call upon me, in your 
most welcome letter of 28th September, to direct the disposition of about 1,200 you expected to receive on your 
negro speculation. My only wish is that you should apply the money to your own occasions, calling to the aid 
of your judgment the advice of that excellent friend whom you will one day further discover I have justly 
appreciated. Butler, who is now here, made me very unhappy, by telling me he left him very sick, and I sincerely sighed to be at his bedside. 
</p><p>
A large fund of stoicism will be necessary to support the want of letters from you till we meet ; for I suppose 
you have, according to directions long since given you, ceased to write ; and it would be impossible to instruct 
you how to direct to me, my change of place will be so variable. 
</p><p>
We have to-day a heavy fall of snow here, and I fear I shall not be able to take water on the Ohio before it 
breaks up. This, with other considerations, lends much to determine me upon the voyage by sea to New Orleans. But I can not make up my mind until I again see D. Commins, whom I hourly expect here from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, with whom I must endeavor to procure some negroes, or by some other means, as I can not think of returning without some new ones, or at least our old ones from Ohio. 
</p><p>
I live here at the Mansion House Hotel, late Bingham's, in Third Street, kept by an Englishman in the best style I have yet seen in America. My expenses are 
heavier than I wish, on every account, but I have become so public a character, any thing tending to shabbiness or 
obscurity would bring discredit upon you, to avoid which I know you would prefer a larger share of future sacrifices. The company are genteel and numerous, principally foreigners, and not a Democrat in thirty, the general number at the house. 
</p><p>
My silence on your recovery and the health of the boys arises from inability to express my joy and thanksgiving 
to God. But I beseech you to seek the utmost change of company and occupation. Nothing can better insure my 
hopes of finding you re-established in your constitution ; and every day's experience convinces me of the wisdom 
and facility of not only mitigating the ills of life, by resolving to contemn their mischief, but even of our 
capability to be happy in spite of them. Without disappointing contrary conclusions you would draw from our 
separation, I could give you many examples, during my reverses, since I left you; but you will hereafter find 
them with more satisfaction in my notes. I shall only add, that you should never forget that a steady pursuit 
of gaiety will prove the best prescription for the longest enjoyment of the summer season, and prepare the largest 
and most serene autumn of life. We have prospects already opened to you that beckon us to wealth and 
repose; if they should prove delusive, our piety and moderation will insure tranquillity. 
</p><p>
I am much at a loss to know how to buy any thing here for you. I shall, however, procure some things. I 
have rigged myself out in consideration of the extravagant prices of things at <a href="/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> ; and have not forgotten the boys' shoes, though God knows when they will get them, and I can, badly guess the sizes. I could tell you a 
good deal .of what might pass for news with you, but it is not worth while, and could not find room here. I 
must not refuse, however, to mention that I have heard here young Michael de Courcy is married to a rich lady 
in England, and has a child or two. The Admiral's daughter is married to a Captain Dashwood, of the Navy. 
I learned no other particulars of the family. Wilkinson, I hear, has taken passage from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> for New Orleans, contrary to every expectation I could form, which 
I mention as a circumstance, if true, not quite indifferent to my future tranquillity on the Mississippi. 
</p><p>
You forgot to put Kitty Percy's, and your own, hair into your letter, with the boys' drawings. The disappointment, I hope, has not arisen from my knowing how 
to prize both. How happy I should feel, hereafter, in the pleasure Miss P. might enjoy, and confer upon us, by 
making a trip with us to Europe. <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Burr</a> has given notice 
to the Marshal. of Virginia, to be prepared with a guard 
of gentlemen at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, to conduct him from thence, 
on the 16th of next month, to <a href="/results.php?city=chillicothe" rel="city">Chillicothe</a> ; but some in 
tervention or other, I apprehend, will prevent that journey. Harding will smile at this ; but let him mourn 
over the misery of talents without strength of nerve or energy of character, which have only shone to consume 
the fame of the Chief Justice, who has disappointed every lawyer and friend he possessed, and may possibly 
fall a sacrifice to the mob government of the day, for attempting to stroke, while he should have muzzled, the tiger of Democracy. Remind H g continually of my attachment; and assure the Scotts, Major Trask, and all other friends, of my warm regards. War direct with Britain is even yet the dread of the Democrats ; but should it happen in six months afterward, down fall<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel=""> Jefferson</a> and company. 
</p><p>
From your husband, <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT</a>.
