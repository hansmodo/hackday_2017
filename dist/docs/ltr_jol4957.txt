My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I beg leave to introduce to your acquaintance, and 
recommend to your civilities the Marquis de la Yienne. He arrived in camp while we were at <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a>, with recommendatory letters to the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, and has been with him ever since. He is now going to present himself to Congress. If he asks for any thing, they will best know 
whether his request is reasonable and well founded. Unfortunately there is a prejudice against foreigners in many of our officers. It is not without uneasiness 
that some of them see <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron De Steuben</a>, who has certainly rendered us very important services, and who is without doubt as capable of commanding as 
any major general we have, appointed to the temporary command of a division in the absence of so many major generals. 
</p><p>
The last accounts from the enemy are, that they were busily employed in embarking their baggage and 
horses. Yesterday I had a view of their fleet, which appeared to be getting under weigh. 
</p><p>
Six grenadiers came in yesterday, one of them a very intelligent fellow, says that desertion prevails so 
much among them that unless they are speedily embarked, their army will dwindle into nothing. 
</p><p>
I felicitate you, my dear father, upon the many 
happy events which have taken place during your presidency, and upon the happy prospects which continue 
to present themselves. May God preserve you to enjoy the complete triumph of liberty and your country. 
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
