SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor of transmitting such resolves of 
Congress as have passed since my last, which are 
either relative to your department, or necessary for 
your information. The Congress have authorized you 
to proceed in the exchange of prisoners, agreeably to 
the cartel at present existing, or such other regulation. as you may think proper to make in the matter, provided the enemy will relax in their treatment 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=chl' rel='colleague'>General Lee</a>, and acknowledge him. to be a prisoner of Avar, and as such entitled to be exchanged. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the arrival of a vessel at 
this port, from France, with eleven thousand stand of 
arms in good order, and, I am informed, fit for immediate use. She has brought likewise fifteen hundred gun-locks, and a large quantity of flints. Six 
thousand eight hundred of the arms are public property. The balance, which belong to individuals, the 
Congress have empowered the Secret Committee to 
purchase immediately. I have wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> 
to repair to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, agreeably to the inclosed resolve. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Colonel Clinton</a> was yesterday appointed a Brigadier-General, in consequence of a very warm recommendation from the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. As 
he is an officer of established good character, and is 
now engaged in obstructing the river, his station at 
the Highlands will be more convenient, and highly 
agreeable to the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
Your favor, by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, was duly received, 
and a Committee appointed to confer with him, the 
result of which shall be immediately transmitted. I 
have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem 
and respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
