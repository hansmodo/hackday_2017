California, Mission of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san diego">San Diego</a>, December 10th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>.
</p><p>
Dear Father and Mother, Brothers and Sisters:
</p><p>
After an absence of eight long months I at last have an opportunity of writing to let you know that we are alive and have reached in safety the borders of the promised land. We have made our way through a wilderness of eighteen hundred miles; underwent many hardships and privations; passed through many dangers and difficulties; crossed garden and desert; landed safely in California and are enjoying very best health at present.
</p><p>
We have not heard one word from home since we left and suppose you have heard nothing from us. We wrote several letters on the way but met with no certain chance to send one until after we came to this place leaving for on the third inst., and we wrote a brief letter informing you of our arrival here and promising the particulars of our journey by the next vessel.
</p><p>
We have kept a journal of everything of interest that transpired on the way and will give you extracts as we think will be of interest to you. After leaving the upper cross-timbers we had a very good road from there on to the Brazos River, a distance of two hundred and thirty miles from home; fine grass and water all the way. We reached this river an the 22nd of April and forded it without much difficulty. From here we traveled too much west and struck the river again in about sixty miles. While a band of Tonkoway Indians came into camp in daylight and stampeded and drove off seven head of horses. A company of sixty men immediately followed after them and the next day returned with all the horses. We had several false alarms after this but saw no more Indians from here to El Paso.  From this place on a distance of 200 miles we had a good road and plenty of grass and water.
</p><p>
On the 16th of May we came to a large spring of excellent water and lay by several days to cut wagon tires. While at this place Mr. Sims of Blossome Prairie died of liver disease The morning we left here I was taken very sick with diarhea and severe fever and continued very sick for about two weeks. After recovering from this I have enjoyed excellent health ever since. From this spring the next water was 25 miles and was strong sulphur and salt, so that we would have been better off without it. After leaving this water we struck a level plain and traveled 70 miles without water. The first we found was large pools of pure cold water in a ridge of sand hills. We were three days and nights crossing the plains. The animals gave out so that we had to stop the wagons and send them on about ten miles to the water, and after resting and recruiting them returned for the wagons. A great many of the company believe if we had traveled more south we would have found water plenty, but I don't know; for we sent water hunters many miles in every direc tion. We remained at this place one week and then went on about 80 miles and came to the Puerco river, a narrow, deep, muddy stream. We made boats of wagon beds and ferried across the loading; pulled the wagons across with ropes and swam the animals. We crossed the river on the 3rd of June. On the 4th we went on and within two miles of the crossing fell into a plain wagon road which had been made by a company of fifty wagons from San Antonio. We now had a firm level road for 60 miles up the river, but the grass and water not good. After leaving the river we had about 80 miles of mountainous country, some places bad -- good grasses and fine spring water all the way. While in the mountains we came up with San Antonio company; eight families and one hundred men.
</p><p>
The first water we came to after getting through the mountains was very salt and made the animals all sick to drink it.
</p><p>
The Indian guide who was with the San Antonio company said it was yet go miles or better to El Paso, and little or no water and we had better travel in small companies. Some rushed their teams clear through to the Rio Grande; some stopped and dug wells; some went twenty or thirty miles and sent their teams back to the salt springs, and others left their wagons on the way, drove their animals on to water and then returned for the wagons. We and a few others stayed behind waiting for rain, and the same evening we left salt water there fell a tremendous heavy rain so that the road was a flood of water and the branches and ravines all running. The road was level and good, and the way  except one place about three miles through a range of mountains was very rocky and bad; grass was tolerably good. A great many animals died on the way, and a great many so broke down that they were fit for nothing any more.
</p><p>
We traveled slowly, stopping at every good patch of grass, saving our animals as much as possible, and arrived at El Paso the 1st of July. We expected to send letters back from this place but met with no opportunity. Colonel Bryant from Trinity, who returned home, left El Paso the morning before we came in. A great many sent letters home by him.
</p><p>
We remained in El Paso 12 days. The Mexicans were friendly to Americans. We bought peaches, pears, apples, grapes, onions, green corn, green beans, wheat and unbolted flour. There was no bacon to be had and very little beef or mutton, and that very indifferent. Mules and oxen were not to be had. The Indians were constantly making incursions on the inhabitants and driving off their stock. At this place the company divided, some went one way and some another; some left their wagons and went on with pack mules. While we remained here the emigrants were daily coming in but we could get no, news later than 17th April. We left El Paso the 13th July and traveled slowly up the river, making camp every few days until the animals were rested enough to go on. We had a fine smooth road and plenty of grass all the way -- of the river 80 miles above El Paso we had to take the wagons to pieces and cross in a little canoe and spliced on each side -empty kegs. We left the Rio Grande on the 28th July and traveled about 20 miles and came into Cook's trail a large plain wagon road. Hundreds of wagons had already been before us to Guadaloupe Pass, a distance of 220 miles. We had a beautiful level road with a few exceptions, fine tender grass and plenty of good water all the way. The Pass is about 16 miles through and tremendous bad road. We had to back our wagons seventy times in going six miles, but we came through safe without breaking our wagons. From this place to Santa Cruz is about 112 miles. Here is the range of wild cattle, hundreds of them were killed by the emigrants. We killed one and barbecued as much as we could haul. Along here was the best grass we had on the whole route, a very good road and excellent water. About ten miles before we came up to Santa Cruz we had a very bad mountain to cross, but by doubling teams we went through without much difficulty. Santa Cruz is a little isolated Mexican village of about 300 inhabitants; unprotected and exposed to the mercy of the Apache Indians who come in at times and drive off all their stock; kill and take them prisoners. We bought of them peaches, apples, quince, pomgranites, tender green corn, onions and coarse unbolted flour. They had no meat of any kind to sell. The articles that traded best with them were calicos and white domestic. From this place to Tucson is 108 miles of very good road, good grass and good water. About 50 miles from Santa Cruz we passed an old deserted village with orchard hanging full of most delicious peaches and quince. We laid us in a full supply. Tucson is a Mexican town of about 500 inhabitants. They had to sell mules, oxen, cows and calves, sheep, green corn, unbolted flour, cheese, grapes and dried beans. From Tucson to Pimose [Pima] village is 75 miles; beautiful level road all the way but grass and water scarce. About 12 miles from the village we came in sight of the long wished for Gila River. It is narrow at this place, runs swift, the water cool and good tasted. The Pimose are a tribe of friendly Indians settled along the river in villages. They raise fine corn, wheat and melons and supply the emigrants to feed their animals across the desert. The articles most in demand with them were blue blankets, white domestic and hard beans. At this place begins the desert. It is about 200 miles from the last of these villages to the crossing of the Colorado at the mouth of the Gila.
</p><p>
No other water but the river, and very little grass. We bought 12 bushel of corn and wheat, we could haul no more, and left the village the 22nd of September. After leaving the village we had about 45 miles without water or grass and the whole way very sandy. We hauled water in kegs, enough for the animals to drink, and the 2nd day reached the river, but found no grass. The first we came to was 20 miles further on, only a small patch and mighty eaten down by the stock before us. At this place we met a company of Mexicans returning from the gold mines. They gave awful accounts of the road before us, that the way was strewn with dead animals, and that wagons and property of every kind were left on the road all the way through the desert. This news created great alarm amongst all the emigrants. We immediately unpacked our wagons and threw out all heavy articles we could possibly dispense with to lighten the load. From here we traveled about  five miles to a large patch of excellent grass. Here we lay by 8 days to recruit the teams. The emigrants all rested and recruited their animals on this grass. At this place we learned from a pack company that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="none">Ex President Polk</a> was dead and that the cholera was raging all over the United States. A great many of the emigrants put on mourning.
</p><p>
We found that the only way to get through was to travel slowly in the cool of the day, save the animals as much as possible and stop at every little grass we could find. We soaked corn in water and gave each a small ration every day. From here down to the mouth of the Gila we had alternately dust and sand nearly the whole way and very little grass; some places on the banks of the river little patches of green corn grew. The Gila and Colorado both overflow their whole valleys leaving a light ashy loam when the water recedes. The dust was almost insufferable; it was generally from six to twelve inches deep. It was almost impossible for our wagons to travel nearer than fifty yards to another.
</p><p>
We met caravans of Mexicans almost every day. They all gave bad news and we found their statements to be but too true.
</p><p>
A great many, when their teams began to fail, left their wagons and packed what they could; others left wagons and everything except enough to take them through. Boxes and trunks of clothing were thrown out, chests of costly medicine, chests of carpenters tools many would throw their things into the river to pre vent the Indians and Mexicans from getting them; some sold -- iron tools, cases of surgical instruments, cases of watch-makers instruments, chests of valuable books and bed-clothing -- them in the sand, and other would dig them up. The most of the wagons were burned, -- cooking utensils, cooking stoves, vessels of every description, guns, powder and lead, gold washers, shovels, axes, chains of all kinds, whole sacks of coffee, barrels of lard, bacon and other provisions; blacksmith tools; table-ware of every description; and in fact you can name nothing that was not lost on this road, yet, a great many who had good teams, traveled slowly and managed them with care, came through without much loss. A man came in from Houston, Texas, who threw his patent gold washer in the river; built a fire, burned up his wagon and everything else but enough provisions to bring him through.
</p><p>
The first emigrants reached the Colorado about the middle of August and they have been coming in one continuous line ever since. We arrived at the crossing of the Colorado the 15th October. We had dreaded this river the whole way for we had heard that several Americans had been killed by the Indians, and that it was dangerous crossing, but gratitude to our Government, a company of soldiers were here for the protection of the emigrants. One of the ferrymen told me that upward of two hundred wagons crossed the river during the month of November. Here we found plenty of grass, cane and muskite beans. While we lay by the river waiting to cross Captain Thorn, U. S. dragoon, We crossed the river the 19th, and landed safely on California soil. From the crossing 15 miles down the river -- We then left the river and traveled 15 miles to the emigrant wells, the whole way very sandy. Here we found plenty good water and muskite beans but no grass. These beans grow in clusters on the muskite trees. They are termed by the emigrants "bread fruit" because they grow in the desert, they are sweet and when ground make good cole-flour and mush. They are as good food for animals as corn or oats. We rested at the wells three days, gethered as many beans as we could haul, and at four o'clock in the evening filled all our vessels with water and started across the main desert. We now had 37 miles without water or grass, the whole way a heavy bed of sand. We started again at daybreak and traveled slowly, resting the animals at short intervals, and at 12 o'clock stopped and gave each a little water and rested there three hours; then traveled on till dark and encamped for the night and early next morning traveled on again, and about noon arrived at Camp Salvation on the Poca River. Here was a large lake of good water with a brook running off from it and plenty of good grass. Had it not been for this water, the muskite beans and the corn at the Pimose village, not one wagon could have come through. There are various opinions about this water; some think it comes from the Colorado, others that it is rain water accumulated; at any rate General Kearney,  10  Captain Cook  11 and others went through without finding it. We remained here several days to rest and recruit our mules; cut hay to do them through the rest of the desert, and on the 30th, left Camp Salvation and traveled 13 miles to the next water, a large lake of excellent water, but no grass. This fifteen miles was fine road. From here to the next water was 25 miles; the way very sandy but not so bad as the previous road. The first we came to was a small creek, the water a little brackish and no grass. Our mules were so tired that we had to rest here one day. From this the next water was 16 miles along the bed of a dry creek and the worst sand of the desert. In going this 16 miles I counted 27 dead animals immediately by the road, besides those that wandered off in search of water and died. We left camp early and traveled about 9 miles, the whole way like pulling up a steep hill. The mules gave out so we encamped and rested until morning, then went on 7 miles and arrived at valley Uta, the end of the desert. Here we found a good water and tolerable grass. From this place to Worner's  12 ranch is 35 miles, tolerably good road, plenty of water, but grass rather scarce. We rested at Valley Uta one day, then went on and reached Worner's the  9th November. Here we lay by two weeks. We were advised by Colonel Worner and others to go either to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san diego">San Diego</a> or Los Angeles and remain over the winter, that on account To the rainy season it would be impossible to travel to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> by land this winter, and that nothing could be done in the mines before spring. We concluded to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san diego">San Diego</a>, arriving here the 29th of November. From Worner's this place is 70 miles, some very bad road but good water and grass. It is a mountainous country, beautiful valleys, some large oak timber though scarce.
</p><p>
We at first thought to sell our wagons and mules and go up to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> by water, but the emigrants had brought so many and sold that now there was no demand for them. There is no chance to get a house in town; every one is taken up and a great many living in tents; provisions scarce and very high; flour is 25 cents per pound and other things in proportion. Emigration to California I believe had no parallel in history. Every place we can hear from is full to overflowing and hundreds still coming in. The most of them go to Los Angeles and Monterey. Hundreds leave their train and come on foot to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san diego">San Diego</a> and go up by water. Of the country we know nothing as yet only what little we can hear from passengers. We understand there is a great deal of fatal sickness in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> caused by being exposed at the mines.
</p><p>
The climate around <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san diego">San Diego</a> is mild and pleasant and very healthy. As far as I can learn the emigrants have been remarkably healthy on the road and comparatively few deaths. A great many would have suffered for provisions but the Government sent aid to them. We had enough to bring us into the settlement.  We hear no certain account from those who went the Northern paths. The latest news from mines, is, that gold is found in 27 pound lumps, but I expect such pieces are few and far between.
</p><p>
We know not yet whether we shall settle in California or return to Texas, it is altogether owing to how we like the country when we see more of it. The doctor has [not] been sick a day since we left the crosstimbers and looks better than you have ever seen him. I have never enjoyed better health in my life than I have done since last May. Little Pussy 13 and Johny 14 have not been sick an hour since we left Bonham; they both look red and rosey and have grown so they cannot wear a garment that was made for them when we left home. They both rode in a carriage the whole way, never appeared to get tired but was always ready, of a morning to start on. Puss would the whole way gather flowers and pretties for her Grand Ma, and still talks about her every day and says when she learns to write she will send her a letter. She can talk right plain now. John is a great big fat fellow, he has been running everywhere since July but cannot talk much. His whole delight is to drive the mules. Every evening when we would stop, the first thing, he would grab the whip, then run about and hollow at every thing in his way.
</p><p>
Well, I think my paper is about filled -- or -- Remember me to one and all, and may we all meet again is my prayer.
</p><p>
