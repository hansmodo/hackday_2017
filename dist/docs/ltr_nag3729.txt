Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency the 8th of February, since 
which I am without your favors. In my last, I informed you that I had written to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a> 
for reenforcements. Inclosed is his answer. I am 
persuaded he must have mistaken your intentions. I 
find nothing is to be expected from that quarter. I 
am sorry the legion was put in motion, as it may 
raise the enemy's apprehensions, and bring upon us 
reenforcements, which might not have been otherwise 
sent, at least so soon. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will see by the King's speech, and 
other measures taking in Great Britain, the enemy 
are determined to prosecute the war and from the 
Dean of Gloucester's plan of pacification, and other 
Parliamentary debates, there can hardly be a doubt 
of the operations being principally to the southward. 
You will also see, by the returns inclosed, how incompetent our force is to any great operation. The 
country is naturally weak, and greatly reduced by the 
ravages of intestine disputes between the Whigs and 
Tories. We are remote from support and supplies of 
every kind; no large bodies of militia can be hastily 
called together here, nor can supplies of any kind be 
had but with the greatest difficulty. We have three 
hundred men now without arms, and twice that number so naked as to be unfit for any duty, but in 
cases of desperation. Not a rag of clothing has arrived to us this winter. Indeed, our prospects are 
really deplorable. It is true we get meat and rice, 
but no rum or spirits. Men and officers without pay, 
in this situation, cannot be kept in temper long. I 
will not trouble you with a detail of all our difficulties. They would be too troublesome to enumerate; 
but I cannot but apprehend for a country so badly 
supported, and naturally so weak and helpless. I 
persuaded the Legislature to raise black regiments, 
but could not prevail; not because they objected to 
the expense (for they give a most enormous bounty 
for white men, and pay in slaves), but from an apprehension of the consequences. 
</p><p>
It has always been my opinion that, if we could 
support the extremes of the Confederation, the middle 
States would always support themselves. Upon this 
principle, I have ever been anxious to get a force to 
the southward, so formidable as to discourage the enemy from attempting their reduction. There is no 
way to effect this, but to render their subjection so 
difficult and expensive as to make the value less 
than the trouble and expense. All the Southern 
States look to you for support. I will do all I can, 
and you know me too well to suppose I shall shrink 
at small difficulties. But how feeble are the best 
intentions, and how vain an obstinate perseverance 
against a very unequal force ! 
</p><p>
The enemy have been out lately, in considerable 
force, in St. Thomas's. They routed <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>'s 
command, and killed, took, and wounded, upwards of 
twenty men. They have not ventured out on our 
side, although the Assembly have been sitting within 
thirty miles of town, and the enemy a much greater 
force than we have, which induces me to believe they 
have orders not to risk a general action. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> has burnt all the enemy's forage, close under 
their noses at <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. I am improving every moment in disciplining and managing the troops, that 
they may be in the best condition for whatever may 
happen. But, alas ! we no sooner get our men tolerably well acquainted with their duty, than their 
term of service expires, and they leave us, and often 
without others to supply their places. I am, with 
great respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
