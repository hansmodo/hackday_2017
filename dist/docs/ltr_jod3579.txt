MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE birth day was celebrated yesterday with as much 
joy, affection and festivity as ever, and as it happened, 
the new French minister was then presented. Poor 
Genet, I fear, is undone. Bad as his conduct has 
been, I cannot but pity him. What will become of 
him, I know not. The name of his successor is Fauchet. Gloomy as I was in expectation daily of afflicting news from home, I contented myself with 
paying my respects to the President with the Senate, 
but I thought it would not become me to be present 
at the ball of a Saturday night, especially at a time 
when I could not get it out of my thoughts that my 
venerable parent might be closing her eyes forever. 
</p><p>
The Senate has been several days trying a con 
tested election of Mr. Gallatin with their doors open. 
It is at length determined that a gallery is to be built, 
and our debates public at the next session of Congress. What the effect of this measure, which was 
at last carried by a great majority, will be, I know 
not ; but it cannot produce greater evils than the con 
test about it, which was made an engine to render 
unpopular some of the ablest and most independent 
members. Some of the younger members may descend from their dignity so far, perhaps, as to court 
popularity at the expense of justice, truth and wisdom, by flattering the prejudices of the audience, 
but I think they will lose more esteem than they will 
acquire by such means. 
</p><p>
If my mother still lives, present her my duty and 
tender sympathy under her affliction. I am, with 
every tender sentiment, 
</p><p>
Yours forever, 
</p><p>
