</p><p>
. . . Our regiment with all General Worth s division are quartered in the town, which is situated in a 
nook of the huge mountains which lie immediately 
around it on three sides, their frowning and broken 
peaks seeming almost to hang over it. On the east 
the Saddle Mountain, so called from its striking re 
semblance in outline to a Mexican saddle; on the 
south the Sierra; on the west the Mitre Mountain, 
its crest from our position appearing as regularly cut 
with points as a royal crown. The scenery far surpasses anything in the States, and our traveled friends 
say, anything in Europe. I wish you could gaze with 
me on one of the magnificent sunsets here. The god 
of day slowly sinking behind the cloud-capped summits of the Sierra whose frowning cliffs are presented 
to us in the deepest shadow, their crests apparently 
supporting the sky gorgeously painted with every hue 
of the spectrum, while the deep lateral gorges of the 
mountain are bathed in light long after the sun has 
disappeared from our view and we are enveloped in 
the shadows of evening. The moon here has all the 
brilliancy we boast in Florida, the climate is as soft, 
the air as pure and I judge from the tropical fruits 
growing here in luxuriance and abundance that there 
is no danger of the frosts which have rendered northern 
Florida almost a waste. We have exposed in the 
markets here the fruits and productions of all climes. 
From the mountain heights the apple, pear, potato, 
etc., and from the plains the orange, fig, banana, 
pomegranate, date, et idoneum genus. It truly might 
be an earthly paradise were the inhabitants civilized. 
They, alas, are lost in the most groveling superstition and ignorance and are under a government that 
tramples them to the dust. I trust a better day is 
about to dawn on this benighted region and that 
another generation under a better government may 
abandon their idleness and popish idolatry. The 
town is built entirely of stone, the houses mostly one 
story in height, with flat roofs, the walls very thick, 
the windows unglazed, though heavily grated with 
iron bars and at night secured with ponderous shutters. 
The doors which are of the most substantial character 
would be well suited to a state prison in our country, 
the floors are all of cement like the basement floors in 
St. Augustine. The narrow streets all paved are enclosed between lofty stone walls; the gutters which 
with us are on each side next the trottoir are here in 
the centre of the street. There are several large 
plazas or public squares on the main one stands 
the Cathedral, a very large and fine building in the 
Moorish style. On the principal stone bridge over the 
San Juan is a large statue of the Virgin Mary, having 
around her shoulders a green cloak and on her head 
a gilded crown. All Mexican passers uncover and 
bow, perhaps kneel and pray to this image. Near the 
bridge was much of the slaughter in the late action. 
The walls of many of the houses are thickly marked 
with shot, the one in which I am now writing had 
the projecting gratings torn from the windows by 
cannon balls and in every direction may be perceived 
the traces of recent battle. 
</p><p>
On the west of the town, crowning the summits of 
the lower mountains, are the forts and the Bishop s 
palace (Obispado), so gallantly carried by our division under General Worth. The Bishop s palace in 
the distance realizes all 1 have read and seen in pictures of the old castles of Europe, now standing in 
ruins, monuments of the feudal ages. I have been so 
much occupied since my arrival that I have not had 
time closely to examine this interesting work or the 
many ruins which surround the place and prove that 
its prosperity has been long on the decline. 
</p><p>
There is not a broken arch or fallen column which 
does not interest me. I would like to explore every 
ruin and trace in the fragments and shattered sculpture the history of a fallen people, the descendants of 
the proud and magnificent Spaniards. I mentioned 
in my last that Captain Ridgely, after gaining a 
brilliant reputation in the recent battles, was thrown 
from his horse about noon on the twenty-fourth, and 
died on the twenty-seventh. How shocking after all 
the dangers he has passed through to die so miserable 
a death ! Major Lear died of his wounds on the thirty- 
first, and was buried yesterday with all the honors. . . . 
A thousand conjectures are afloat about our future 
movements, but they are only conjectures. It seems 
certain that Tampico will be attacked after the termination of the armistice. We hear that Santa Anna 
is assembling an army of thirty thousand men at San Luis Potosi where, should we advance, the Mexicans 
will make a desperate stand. I think, however, that 
we shall never go there. It is three hundred miles 
beyond <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>, at least one hundred of which is a 
perfect desert without wood or water. The route 
would be utterly impracticable for an army. I know 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> that he will not attempt it unless 
compelled to do so by a positive order from the highest 
authority. It is supposed by some that the truce 
will be continued until the meeting of the Mexican 
Congress in December to give them an opportunity 
to make peace, but nothing definite can be known 
until the return of the express from Washington with 
instructions consequent upon the capture of this 
place. The Cabinet will, of course, brood in solemn 
consultation before they decide and then will probably 
determine upon something far different from what we 
expect. General Wool has been heard from with his 
division at Monclova to the northwest of our position 
and about ninety miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>. I can tell you 
nothing of the battle which you will not have learned 
from the papers. The Fifth, you will see, bore a distinguished part and have been honorably mentioned. 
I shall never cease to regret my absence. Such an 
opportunity occurs but once in a lifetime ! . . .

Uncle Edmund was eight hours under fire in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> s staff. The invitation he received 
from the General in the morning was: " Get up, 
Kirby, and come with me and I will give you a chance 
to be shot." . . .
