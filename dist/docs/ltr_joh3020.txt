SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to transmit to you sundry resolves of Congress, of a very important nature, to 
which I beg leave to solicit your attention. 
</p><p>
The Congress, having had your letters of the 1st 
and 6th instant under consideration, have come to 
the inclosed resolve on the subject, by which you 
perceive they decline making any alteration in the 
resolve of the 6th of January, and that it was not 
their intention that Colonel Campbell should experience any other hardship than such confinement as 
is necessary to his security for the end they had in 
view when they passed that resolve. 
</p><p>
The obvious distinction made by General Howe, in 
his treatment of <a href='/results.php?tla=chl' rel='colleague'>General Lee</a>, who is notoriously committed to the custody of the provost, and denied his 
parole, while our other officers are admitted to it, 
was the ground on which Congress proceeded when 
they passed that resolve, the intention of which was 
to show that, in proportion as severities against him 
were increased, the same treatment should be exercised on six field-officers. 
</p><p>
The principle of retaliation was early adopted by 
the States of America, and, if adhered to, will be 
the most likely way to prevent our enemies from 
making distinctions, which have no other foundation 
but the gratification of their revenge; <a href='/results.php?tla=chl' rel='colleague'>General Lee</a> 
having an undoubted right to every indulgence that 
our other officers, prisoners among them, may receive. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to the Governor and Council of Virginia, and likewise to Colonel Stephen, on the subject of the inclosed resolves. 
</p><p>
The Congress have endeavoured to put a stop to 
foreigners coming over to America to enter the service, not only by directing the Committee of Secret 
Correspondence to write to the agents abroad to Discourage them from such views, but by declaring that 
they shall not be employed unless they are well acquainted with our language. 
</p><p>
Your several favors of the 20th, 23d, and 28th of 
February, and 1st and Gth of March, have been duly 
received and laid before Congress. I am also this 
minute honored with your favor of the 14th, which 
shall be laid before Congress as soon as possible. I 
have the honor to be, with sentiments of the great 
est esteem. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
