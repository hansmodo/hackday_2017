I AM one hundred and fifty miles in the mountains, amid the most sublime scenery I ever saw, where the snow still lingers on the hills and where the ice freezes in our buckets every night. In this pure and bracing atmosphere there is no sickness, and two months from this time the living throng who forced their way into these wilds will be compelled to return to the Valley to escape the deep snows which will then encumber this desolate portion of California. My transitfrom the Valley was a series of adventures which I have partially and briefly detailed to the N. O. True Delta, one of whose correspondents I am (by request --I write none others), and it was one of the most interesting excursions I ever made.
</p><p>
I will not detail it to you, as there is subject matter enough left for a full communication without it. The evening previous to my
leaving Marysville I had the felicity of receiving your welcome letter and one from my wife, being the only ones I have received from Ottawa since the date of the 25th March. I also received a copy of the Free Trader, being the fourth number which has reached me in California.
</p><p>
Hereafter direct all communication to Marysville, Yuba County. I wish I had more of as attentive correspondents as yourself, for one of our greatest pleasures is receiving letters from home--as a proof of this--"Hello, Handy" (a capital fellow from Albion, Michigan, and whose tent joins mine)--"had you rather get a letter from home and go without your dinner, with a mountain appetite, or get your dinner and go without the letter?"--"I had rather have the letter anytime--why, there's no comparison." That's my case exactly, so send on your letters. I am in the region of the fabulous Gold Lake, but even here there are, as elsewhere, good and poor diggings, and many a poor fellow is delving away without being able scarcely to earn the salt for his porridge, while a few, a very few, are doing well or passably so, and yet this is the richest portion of golden California which I have seen.--You know my predictions with regard to the sufferings of the coming overland emigrants. They are pouring in upon us and in such a condition as to excite pity from hearts of stone. Last year the great fault of the emigrants was in loading. The present year the emigrants seem to have fallen into the other extreme. They had not provisions enough, and then many started with horses for the sake of greater speed.
</p><p>
Last year the grass was unusually good, better than it had been for many years. But now, either from drought or heavy snows, the grass was dried up, or the melting snows filled the valleys with water and overflowed the grassy bottoms. The valley of the Humboldt, where we traveled many days along the borders of the stream, this year was a vast lake and the emigrants were obliged to take the hills, frequently making long and laborious detours to avoid or get around side valleys where scarcely any forage could be obtained. I recollect one place where they were compelled to go thirty miles over difficult mountains out of their course to make about six. One man paid an Indian fifteen dollars to swim to a little island on the Humboldt and bring over grass enough to feed his mule. Under these circumstances teams gave out, horses and mules broke down, provisions were exhausted, and hundreds of miles from the settlements and far from aid, men, women and children were left entirely destitute, without a mouthful to eat and without the means of
getting forward. Perhaps a broken-down horse or mule would be left to carry a remnant of supplies; yet een without this slender aid, you might see even mothers wading through the deep dust or the heavy sand of the desert, or climbing mountain steeps leading their poor children by the hand; or the once strong man pale, emaciated by hunger and fatigue, carrying his feeble infant on his back, crying for water and nourishment, and appeasing a ravenous appetite from the carcass of a dead mule or horse, and when they sink exhausted upon the ground at night, overcome with weariness and want of nourishment, it was only with the certainty of the morning sun they would have to go through with the same or greater evils. Is it strange, then, that under such destitution and misery, where for weeks a draught of good water could not be had, many preferred suicide to this living death? In one day on the Humboldt, three men and two women drowned themselves. The men were observed and taken out once, but they persisted in declaring that death was preferable and succeeded in committing the desperate deed. The women had families and, unable longer to witness the suffering of their children with no prospect of relief, chose the dreadful alternative. I can well appreciate their feelings; for although my sufferings last year were not so great, yet I have seen many a day when death had no terrors. By the earliest who succeeded in reaching the Valley the sufferings of the emigrants were made known and large and liberal contributions of provisions were made and sent out. In addition, traders forced themselves over the snows of the Sierra as far as the Humboldt, but these supplies were scarcely felt. Five pounds of flour were doled out to a man from the free supplies, and afterwards reduced to two and a half, with which they had to travel two hundred miles, and the traders asked two and a half dollars a pound for flour and pork. Hundreds had no money, and even if they had, a large amount would be required to obtain enough to sustain a family through. Of course all were not thus destitute. Some arrived who had provided themselves well, but hundreds and hundreds suffered thus. And now what will they do when they arrive? Though labor is nominally from five to eight dollars a day, there is not sufficient employment for ven those who wintered here, and while a few, very few, may strike a good lead and do well, the great mass can scarcely get enough to sustain life. We shall see more suffering, more destitution this winter than there ever has been, and although there is gold in the mountains, the indefatigable attempt to get it of those who came a year ago without success, wheresoever courage, strength and manhood have been used to their full extent, surely should convince you at home that it is folly to forsake a living business at home and come here in the desperate search of gold. I saw a few days since an old friend of mine from Indiana who had just arrived. He had suffered on the plains, but he got through.
</p><p>
He was a scientific engineer, an industrious worthy man, and doing well at home. He had got a temporary berth as engineer on a small steamboat at a hundred dollars a month, when he could have got more at home. "Why did you come here?" I asked. "Did not all our letters discourage further emigration?" "Yes, but you said there was gold here, and we thought we could get it if you could--that we cuold get it if anybody could; besides too, to speak frankly, we thought that as so many were getting rich they only wrote such letters back to keep others away. And the statements in the papers too, of the immense sums received from California and extracts taken from California papers of rich diggings being continually discovered, of those who had dug large sums in a few days or weeks, made us think that your letters of advice were dictated by sinister motives or that you had not given a correct view of the subject."
</p><p>
"Well, what do you think of it now--are you satisfied?"
</p><p>
"I am--I have seen the Elephant and I wish myself at home."
</p><p>
I have asked the same questions of many and always with the same result. Our honest statements have been either disbelieved or have been ascribed to a motive which does not exist, that of keeping our friends away.
</p><p>
I have sometimes concluded a conversation with many a poor fellow who has become entrapped, by saying what I believe to be true: "Gentlemen, the gold is here--now get it." I can tell you of men who have dug from ten to twenty pounds of gold in a day, but for one such man I can show you a thousand who have made no more than their living. I have seen lumps of gold that weighed several pounds, but for every large lump I have seen hundreds who had not money enough to pay for a dinner. A few who have gone home in the intoxication of success may extol the country and the ease of getting rich. They are the few lucky ones whom fortune has favored. Friends and Fellow Countrymen, if you are determined to come, do so. If you are fortunate, why, well; but if you share the fate of thousands who have gone before you, the consequences be upon your own heads.
</p><p>
I think the course pursued by the conductors of the press in California highly reprehensible in the matter of reporting what I know to be an unfair condition of things respecting gold digging which is one cause of promoting emigration. Under the head of "News from the Mines," glorious accounts are given of the success of various individuals which are calculated to deceive you at home. A few lucky adventurers are reported, the amount raised by each in a short time, &c., &c. This may be true. But not one word is said of the disappointed thousands of those who have worked a whole year without success. Were they to place in one column the cost of outfit, the expense of living and of operating there, the number of unsuccessful miners and business men against the number of lucky ones and the
amount raised by them, it would present a fearful array of figures against California. I believe there have been more fortunes made here by trading and speculation than by mining. The hundred-thousand-dollar men are those who have got rich by speculations, trade or gambling.
</p><p>
Nearly all the claims on the South Fork of Feather River have failed as high as the cañon
</p><p>
Four or five have proved good. A company a mile below Stringtown who had made three or four thousand dollars last winter on the Middle Fork took up a claim a little above on the South Fork, built a dam and race at an expense of two thousand dollars and did not get a dollar. Another company built a dam and race at an expense of over fourteen thousand dollars and did not get three hundred A dozen companies in the vicinity erected dams at from three to ten thousand dollars, and after enduring the labor of prospecting in the winter rains, building cabins, making roads over mountains and suffering incredible hardships with the fortitude which belongs to the American race, have relinquished their claims without getting a dollar, perfectly bankrupt and in debt for the very bread they ate while at work with high anticipations of a fair remuneration. And the traders too have suffered by extending credits to those men who would pay them if they could--but cannot. I know the most of these men personally, and a more industrious and honorable class of men do not exist. In the grand rush to Gold Lake two months ago, thousands of men were in the mountains making the search, and what was the consequence? Why, some good deposits were found and a few made rich or comfortably off, but the great mass made nothing. So it is here. And who is to blame for holding such high attributes to California, for showing but one side of the picture, which induces men, women and children to leave home, friends and comforts to launch forth into a sea of uncertainty, of misery, death, and only of doubtful success, but those through whom they glean their information, the conductors of the presses? The failure of dams is not confined to Feather River alone, but so far as I can learn, it is about the same on all the streams which have been extensively dammed to get at the bed of the stream. Perhaps my statements may not be credited by those who rely upon the arrivals of gold quoted in the papers and by the more ardent at home. All I have to say then is, "Come and try it yourselves--the gold is in the mountains-- get it."

In a letter to Hon. J. D. Caton which I see you have published, I spoke of the condition of things with regard to land titles and squatters' rights. The matter has been festering until it has reached
a head and has broken out. Congress has delayed to admit California as a State, quarreling over an abstract question with which we have nothing to do and thus indirectly countenancing the vicious and evil-disposed in their course against law and order. You will see by the papers the sanguinary conflict of the squatters on town lots in Sacramento City with the constituted authorities This is one of the results of the delay in allowing us to settle our own matters and is only a prelude to other excesses. The authorities are determined to maintain the laws of a State whether admitted or not, and I for one think it highly important for the good of society that they should do so. But the squatters on town lots should not be included with squatters on vacant lands or on the vast claims made under Mexican grants. For instance, if I first lay claim to 160 acres of land and comply with the requisitions of the law, the land properly becomes mine. If I lay out a town on this 160 acres, which is all I can hold by law, my right extends over the whole plat. If another person occupies one of my town lots he trespasses on my equitable rights, and it is in some such way that the difficulty originated at Sacramento City, the squatters refusing to yield their claims to the original proprietors, although there is another dispute with the first occupants on account of its being held as a Mexican grant.--It is certain that the plat was laid out before a State government was organized. The Sacramento squatters are a formidable body of men determined to have a home, but I think they will finally be compelled to yield But there is another question in embryo which will not be so easily settled, and that is squatting on government land--rather upon Mexican grants, for there is not three hundred square miles of desirable land such as can be cultivated in California but what is claimed by a few individuals under Mexican grants. The squatters on this land have the sympathies of the mass of the population, for they think it unreasonable that the few should control the many and deprive them of an abiding place in a new country like this, and under the circumstances which brought them here and compelled them to stay. Here then is another serious affair in embryo and a matter which will be yielded only at the point of the bayonet. Unless Congress settles the matter in some equitable way soon, difficulties of a most serious nature will ensue.
</p><p>
I think I have written you respecting the miners' law on claims. This is a matter which takes care of itself and is as faithfully obeyed as any law of Congress, and it is hardly written, much less printed. I appealed a few days ago to the President of the Association for a
copy of the law for the purpose of sending it home for publication. After a diligent search, it was ascertained that but a single copy existed, and that was ten miles distant. But it is well understood, and when you hear of one miner suing another on a disputed claim, it is not before a judicial tribunal but before the self-constituted miners' court.
</p><p>
But I talk so much of California that I doubt not you, as well as your readers, are wearied--and surely it is no pleasure for me to describe the actual condition of things as I see them. When you get tired of paying the postage on my lucubrations, say so, and I will trouble you no more.
</p><p>
Perhaps I repeat things over and over like old story-tellers; I keep no copies of my letters and cannot tell what I have written before. I should be glad to get the Free Trader, but the only paper I get from the States with any degree of regularity is the True Delta, which comes through my friend Mr. Grant.
</p><p>
It is now sickly in the Valley, chill, fevers, ague and flux prevailing; but in the mountains as high as this nobody is sick.
