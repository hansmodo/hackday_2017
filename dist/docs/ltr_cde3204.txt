SIR, 
</p><p>
Those who have the happiness to be under your Excellency's orders, find in you a father. The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis de la Fayette</a> has a superior title to your Excellency's affection ; he respects, admires, and loves you. 
I had the honor of asking you whether you permitted him to send his cartel to Lord Carlisle, to satisfy 
myself whether you were informed of it. You were so 
kind as to acquaint me that you had not seen the 
cartel. I thought, from that circumstance, that you 
would forbid the execution of it ; I am still persuaded that this is the case. Such marks of zeal, bravery, and sensibility, are never authorized in Europe, 
by its Generals ; they might fruitlessly rob the respective nations of their best subjects. Besides, Ambassadors, Commissioners, and men in office, are sup 
posed to speak only in consequence of orders which 
they have received. As public organs, they owe an 
account only to their own government of the things 
which they hard. Nations revenge their own injuries ; those who have most reason and strength on 
their side are the most sparing in opprobrious terms, 
and despise them ; they respect their enemies, while 
they endeavour to subdue them; they surpass them 
in wisdom, when they refrain from such offensive terms, which, one would think, should be only the 
useless resource of those who would dissemble their 
injustice. 
</p><p>
I could not, then, but presume that Lord Carlisle 
would not accept a cartel, which he would have done extremely well to refuse. Older than <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>M. de la Fayette</a>, the experience which age gives tranquillized me 
upon the two subjects which I have just submitted 
to your Excellency, and which made me regard the 
cartel, till now, as almost null. It appeared to me a 
consequence of the interesting character which led 
this brave and amiable Frenchman into the service 
of the United States ; to have entreated your inter 
position in this affair would have appeared like a 
doubt of your doing it. 
</p><p>
The delicacy of my countryman might likewise 
have been wounded, if it should have been known 
that your refusal had been solicited by me. I do 
not hesitate, however, Sir, to make the request. I 
am this moment informed that <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a> told 
M. de Chouin yesterday, that the English Commissioner had provided himself with a substitute. Can he 
have been guilty of choosing a bully? It is impossible that you should have suffered a doubtful expression in this cartel to have had such an effect. 
This challenge can only regard my Lord Carlisle, and 
could not have been construed otherwise. Your Excellency certainly will not have suffered it. Pardon 
an ill-placed uneasiness, if, in consequence of <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a>'s phrase, I require you, as chief of the French, 
to hinder an individual to take upon himself alone a 
concern which is precious, which regards us all, and 
which is granted by his Majesty to the zeal of his 
navy and army. I have the honor to be, with respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most humble and most obedient servant,
