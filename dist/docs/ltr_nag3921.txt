DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have this moment got intelligence that the enemy are embarking a 
body of troops to make a descent upon <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, and in all probability will be there before to-morrow night. The stores there are immense. I wish you, therefore, to march immediately for the protection 
of that place and the stores. All the State troops and militia you have 
under your command, notwithstanding the orders you received yesterday, to join this army, after putting your troops in motion for George 
town, you will repair there yourself as soon as you can, and take such 
measures the occasion may require. To send the stores up the rivers, 
appears the only probable way of saving them. 700 men go by land 
and water. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, with great esteem, &c., 
</p><p>
