THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, December 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>.

MY DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I inclose herewith a letter from Mr. Dumas, which he 
requested me to transmit. The old gentleman's health 
appears to be very good, and he looks not older than he did 
when you saw him last. But oppression has had its proverbid effect upon him, and he can write, think, nor talk 
about anything but representative democracy and Joel Barlow. 
</p><p>
Last week at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=leyden" rel="city">Leyden</a> I saw our old friend Professor Luzac, who is at this time Rector Magnificus of the University. 
He received us with great cordiality, and I found him in his political sentiments moderate and rational. The instance 
is rare, and accordingly he suits neither of the parties in this country. The "Tories call him Whig, and Whigs a 
Tory," because he neither wishes to be the slave of the ruling power, nor to see his country liberated by means of being conquered. 
</p><p>
There has been much talk about peace, sometimes with, 
sometimes without mediation. One day Sweden and Den 
mark are to be joint mediators, the next the United States 
alone are to perform that part. This moment we are told 
the Baron de Stael has left Stockholm, and the moment after 
we find it is Mr. Jay who has gone from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. 
Amidst all these reports there is no real prospect of peace 
whatever. 
</p><p>
If the affairs of this country had not been so often retrieved from the very brink of the precipice, I should think 
them at this moment absolutely desperate. They all think 
them so, and Mr. Fagel, the greffier, has been at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> 
ever since I arrived here, to solicit ineffectually their inexorable ally to join in a negotiation for peace. 
</p><p>
The subserviency of these people to the will of Great Britain is not at this time altogether voluntary. They 
cannot disencumber themselves of their protectors. It is 
their misfortune to be defended by thirty thousand allies, 
who would be more fatal as enemies than they are serviceable 
as friends. There is but a single step in the transition, and 
from the conduct of the British troops, one would imagine they 
had already taken it. It is hardly possible to conceive how 
much their assistance is dreaded. The cities shut their gates 
against them, all ranksof people equally detestand shun them ; 
and, with what justice I am unable to say, the unpopularity of 
the commander is not less conspicuous than his rank. . . . 
</p><p>
The British Ambassador here, Lord St. Helen s, alias Fitzherbert, did not return my visit of notification. He gave an 
entertainment yesterday, intended for the Duke of York, who 
was expected here but did not come. The Court of the Stadtholdcr assisted at this entertainment. The Ambassador 
sent me an invitation. I sent him for answer that I was engaged, as was really the fact. I shall see him no more. 
</p><p>
This circumstance is in itself so trivial that I have not 
mentioned it to the Secretary of State in my letter of yesterday to him. I do not wish to commence a diplomatic 
career by splitting hairs of etiquette. 
</p><p>
Yet I am desirous that the circumstance should be known 
to Mr. Randolph and to the President. If you will please 
communicate it to the former, the object will be answered. 
I am, etc.
