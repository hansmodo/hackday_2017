A letter from George this morning! It was written on the 20th of June, and he speaks of being on 
crutches in consequence of his horse having fallen with him, and injured his knee. Perhaps, then, he was not in the first battle of the 25th? But bah! I 
know George too well to imagine he would keep quiet at such a moment, if he could possibly stand ! 
I am sure he was there with the rest of the Louisiana regiment. The papers say "the conduct of the 
First Louisiana is beyond all praise"; of course, George was there!

And Jimmy is with him at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> ; but whether in the army, or navy, or what rank if in the first, 
he does not say; he only says he is looking remarkably well. Gibbes he had heard from in a letter dated 
the 16th, and up to then he was in perfect health. His last letter here was dated 10th of March, so we 
are thankful enough now. I was so delighted to read the accounts of the "gallant Seventh " in some paper 
we fortunately procured. At Jackson's address, and presentation of the battery they had so bravely won, 
I was beside myself with delight; I was thinking that Gibbes, of course, was "the" regiment, had 
taken the battery with his single sword, and I know not what besides. Strange to say, I have not an 
idea of the names of the half-dozen battles he was in, in June, but believe that one to be Port Republic.
