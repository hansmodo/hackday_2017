<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='9'>9th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. This party for Johnny was the very 
nicest I have ever had, and I mean it to be my last. I sent word to the Carys to bring their own men. They came 
alone, saying, "they did not care for men. " " That means a raid on ours, growled Isabella. Mr. Lamar was devoted 
to Constance Gary. He is a free lance; so that created no heart-burning.

Afterward, when the whole thing was over, and a success, the lights put out, etc., here trooped in the four girls, 
who stayed all night with me. In dressing-gowns they stirred up a hot fire, relit the gas, and went in for their sup 
per; rechauffe was the word, oysters, hot coffee, etc. They kept it up till daylight.

Of course, we slept very late. As they came in to breakfast, I remarked, " The church-bells have been going 
011 like mad. I take it as a rebuke to our breaking the Sabbath. You know Sunday began at twelve o clock last 
night." " It sounds to me like fire-bells," somebody said.

Soon the Infant dashed in, done up in soldier's clothes: "The Yankees are upon us ! " said he. "Don't you hear 
the alarm-bells They have been ringing day and night ! Alex Haskell came; he and Johnny went off to report to 
Custis Lee and to be enrolled among his " locals," who are always detailed for the defense of the city. But this time 
the attack on Richmond has proved a false alarm.

A new trouble at the President's house: their trusty man, Robert, broken out with the smallpox.

We went to the Webb ball, and such a pleasant time we had. After a while the P. M. G. (Pet Major-General) took 
his seat in the comfortable chair next to mine, and declared his determination to hold that position. <a href='/results.php?tla=rmh' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Hunter</a> and 
Mr. Benjamin essayed to dislodge him. Mrs. Stanard said : Take him in the flirtation room ; there he will soon be captured and led away, but I did not know where that room 
was situated. Besides, my bold Texan made a most unexpected sally : "I will not go, and I will prevent her from 
going with any of you." Supper was near at hand, and Mr. Mallory said: " Ask him if the varioloid is not at his 
house. I know it is. " I started as if I were shot, and I took Mr. Clay's arm and went in to supper, leaving the P. M. G. 
to the girls. Venison and everything nice.
