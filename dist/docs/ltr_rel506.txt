...I am very anxious to get into the field, but am detained by matters
beyond my control.  I have never heard of the appointment, to which
you allude, of Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate States Army,
nor have I any expectation or wish for it.  President Davis holds
that position.  Since the transfer of the military operations in
Virginia to the authorities of the Confederate States, I have only
occupied the position of a general in that service, with the duties
devolved on me by the President.  I have been labouring to prepare
and get into the field the Virginia troops, and to strengthen, by
those from the other States, the threatened commands of Johnston,
Beauregard, Huger, Garnett, etc.  Where I shall go I do not know, as
that will depend upon President Davis.  As usual in getting through
with a thing, I have broken down a little and had to take my bed last
evening, but am at my office this morning and hope will soon be right
again....  My young friend Mr. Vest has just returned from a search
in the city for 'Dixie,' and says he has visited every place in
Richmond without finding it.  I suppose it is exhausted.  Always yours,
