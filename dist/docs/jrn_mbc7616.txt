<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='15'>15th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. When we came home from Richmond, there stood Warren Nelson, propped up against my door, 
lazily waiting for me, the handsome creature. He said he 
meant to be heard, so I walked back with him to the drawing-room. They are wasting their time dancing attendance 
on me. I can not help them. Let them shoulder their musket and go to the wars like men.

After tea came " Mars Kit "he said for a talk, but that Mr. Preston would riot let him have, for Mr. Preston 
had arrived some time before him. Mr. Preston said " Mars Kit " thought it " bad form " to laugh. After that 
you may be sure a laugh from " Mars Kit " was secured. Again and again, he was forced to laugh with a will. I reversed Oliver Wendell Holmes's good resolution never to be as funny as he could. I did my very utmost.

Mr. Venable interrupted the fun, which was fast and furious, with the very best of bad news ! Newbern shelled 
and burned, cotton, turpentine everything. There were 5,000 North Carolinians in the fray, 12,000 Yankees. Now 
there stands Goldsboro. One more step and we are cut in 
two. The railroad is our backbone, like the Blue Ridge and 
the Alleghanies, with which it runs parallel. So many discomforts, no wonder we are down-hearted.

Mr. Venable thinks as we do Garnett is our most thorough scholar ; Lamar the most original, and the cleverest of 
our men L. Q. C. Lamar time fails me to write all his name. Then, there is <a href='/results.php?tla=rmh' rel='acquaintance met'>R. M. T. Hunter</a>. Muscoe Russell Garnett and his Northern wife : that match was made at my house in Washington when Garnett was a member of the 
United States Congress.
