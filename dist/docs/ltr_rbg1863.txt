This moment My beloved Ben, I have heard of your affliction- and my heart claims the privilege of sharing your 
affliction- of mourning with you the loss of your precious son- long separation from those we love is among the severest trials of this life- particularly when sorrows oppress those 
we dearly love. Oh My brother my heart mourns for you- even as if I were with you, to miss the daily intercourse of 
your son - his warm affectionate heart was ever so full of love that he was endeared to all who came under its influence, and my memory of all the overflowing kindness of his life will keep his memory ever green in our hearts- alas, I 
feel so isolated from you and your beloved family- that I feel as if worlds already separate us yet my heart clings to you all with unwonted tenderness 
</p><p>
My beloved Brother and Sister, accept my tenderest love and sympathy- give my devoted love & sympathy to all 
your dear children and believe me ever most affectionately 
</p><p>
your own Sister & friend
