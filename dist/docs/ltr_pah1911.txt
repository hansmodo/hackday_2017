SIR : By the inclosed you will perceive the Ideas of this Commonwealth on the subject of military things. We mean to act with vigour and upon a 
liberal plan. If your State shall be distressed, ours will gladly contribute to its Relief if possible. Our Interests are the same and our operations shall harmonize. 
</p><p>
No news on which I can depend has come here lately from the North. I judge that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> is now or shortly will be at the Mercy of the 
Enemy. The Middle States have not furnished Troops in so great numbers as were expected. I trust your Commonwealth and ours will exhibit a 
different spirit. And altho many Difficultys are to be encountered on the subject of necessarys, yet I hope we may muster a formidable Force by 
the Spring. For this purpose I think the earliest preparations should be made ; and in conformity we are setting about this work immediately. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be Sir,

yr. mo. hble. Servt.
