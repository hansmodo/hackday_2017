Cole has returned from below and we have a good stock of goods. Trade is slow and will not be right brisk until the rainy season on account of the scarcity of water, but we do a very good business and increasing every day. Some of the claims will pay very well. Last Saturday night, four men came into the store and weighed their gold that they had dug that week $1960.00. This is very good wages. But they don't all pay at that rate. Our town is now built up with good buildings as we have a saw mill and plenty of lumber.

As to the society--it is decidedly bad, gambling, drinking, and fighting being the amusements of the miners in their leisure hours. Saturday night is usually celebrated by such hideous yells and occassionally a volley from their revolvers which makes it rather dangerous to be standing around. At least a poor inoffensive jackass found it so the other night. I am glad to be able to say that the majority of the people are from Pike Co, although there
are quite a number from Maine. Among my acquaintances that I have found here is ex-Midshipman Dallas, son of the late Commander Dallas. He has tried mining; got sick, and is now trying to live as a Notary Public Scrivener. He is a very gentlemanly fellow, good company, boasts a good deal of his family and the society he has moved in and is generally called 'the Prince.' Mr. Harper, a lounger, has his wife here, and I believe there are four other families in town, and one young lady. Also I must not forget Miss Jigger, the young squaw brought in from the Rancheria that was destroyed. She is dressed up and prefers a civilized to a savage life, if you can call this a civilized community.

Last Sunday was the glorious 4th of July, and in this country people get most gloriously drunk generally. But in this place we had an awful tragedy in the morning which tended to sober people a little. You will probably see reports of it in the papers, but as it took place opposite our store, and I was an eye witness, I will give you the facts. A certain Doctor Horton built a large saloon and public house called the American. He kept a woman called Eliza, Vanderburg family from New Orleans. He was sued for a debt contracted in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and made his house over to the woman. This was decided to be a fraud and the Sheriff ordered to take possession and sell the property by Judge Lake of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. On application of the woman, Judge Williams of this district granted an injunction. The Sheriff wrote to Judge Lake to know whom he should obey. He ordered him to go on and sell as Judge Williams had no authority to grant the injunction having previously assisted to sell the property. The Sheriff proceeded on Sunday morning to take possession. Horton and the woman armed with revolvers drove him from the house. Now Diggon, the Sheriff is game to the backbone. He summoned a possee of four or five men
and went in and showed his authority and ordered a man to nail up the doors. Horton told the woman to 'shoot his head off.' Diggon says, 'If you shoot you are a dead man.' She fired at the man and missed. Horton fired at the Sheriff and shot him in the groin. The crowd rushed out of the house leaving the Sheriff and his men and Horton and the woman to fight it out. Some fifteen or twenty shots were heard and then all was still. I went over and went in and saw Horton and the woman lying side by side riddled with balls. In five minutes both were dead. The Sheriff were all of the party that was hit and he had strength to walk to the house. He will probably recover. This put a damper on the Fourth and people were quiet all day. Mr. Allen called the people together and related the facts of the suit and most of them think that the Sheriff was right. According to the California Code if one man strikes another without provocation he has a perfect right to shoot him down. Everyone goes armed and at the least quarrel at a gambling saloon out come the revolvers. Someone sings out, 'Don't shoot,' the crowd surge back, and they blaze away. A man's life is but little thought of. Sunday these two persons were killed; yesterday buried; and today almost forgotten.

In the midst of this ungodly community Mr. Hill, a Baptist minister, preaches every Wednesday evening, Standing on the steps of a house he preaches to the whole town. He is a good preacher, but the fruit has not appeared as yet. The Indians steal a mule now and then, but no one has been hurt by them lately.

I see by the papers a revolution has broken out in the dominions of Queen--and she is likely to lose all her kingdom but Tahiti. She called on the French and English to assist her, but in vain. If I had been there and she had called on me I would have gone to the rescue. I should probably have been made a general at least. I shall
wait until another war with Mexico--then I am in, for we are bound to have the whole and the sooner such an event takes place the better for Mexico's good.

Goods are very high, especially provisions, and people that are shipping goods to this country now will make their piles. Hams have gone up to 40¢ flour 15¢, pork 40¢. An immense immigration is expected in from the plains soon and the arrivals at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> are immense. The Chinese bid fair to overrun the country. They could send a million, you know, and not miss them. People are getting really alarmed at the great number coming. I see that 18 women arrived in full blown costume, the style of dress in China. Lastly the country is going ahead and is destined to be the greatest state in the Union. I am anxious to know who is the Whig Nominee for President as I shall take the stump if it is Webster. Write me all the affairs in and about Bucksport as anything will be interesting.
