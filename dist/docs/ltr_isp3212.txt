DEAR GOVERNOR, 
</p><p>
I received your agreeable favor, and congratulate you on the 
glorious intelligence it contains of the capture of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. I have halted my troops, who were on their march 
northward, and desirous of doing every thing to subserve our important cause, and bring our struggles to a happy and speedy 
issue. I should be glad of your opinion respecting my future 
movements whether I shall proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, or remain to 
watch the motions of the enemy on the river, and protect the 
shore, or move immediately down to attack King's Bridge, leaving all the York militia in Dutchess county to guard the river. 
General Parsons, with about two thousand troops, is at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. 
My troops will halt upon the road where they are, till I receive 
your advice in the premises, which I request may be as speedy 
as possible ; also, that you would acquaint me whether you will 
probably be able to afford any assistance, in case it should be 
thought advisable to move down to the Bridge. With esteem 
and respect, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=isp" rel="me">ISRAEL PUTNAM</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. If you should advise going to the Bridge, I desire Colonel Lamb would come down.
