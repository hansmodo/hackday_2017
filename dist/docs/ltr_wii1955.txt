CAMP SMITHS CLOVE July 10 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>

Dear General 
</p><p>
I returned here last night late & found in General orders that Magonigle who I had tryed at the Furnace was to be hanged this morning 
at ten oClock, I marched the whole Division to the Execution (, that were off duty), I cant say I ever felt pleased or happy before at the death or 
suffering of any poor Wretch but what added to it was to see the head of a Corporal of the 1 st Regt. who also left us at the furnace stuck up 
on the Gallows He was taken two nights ago by a party of Major Lees who it seems were at first determined to kill all but on consultation or 
debate agreed to kill only one out of three it fell ro the Corporals lott whose Head was Immediately carried to Camp on a pole by the 
two who escaped instant Death these two Villains were of the same Regiment and have been tryed here this day presume they will meet the 
same fate,- 
</p><p>
I hope in future Death will be the punishment for all such I planly see less will not do poor Magonigle behaved well at his Death Tho he 
said no more than that he forgave all the World I hope this & few more examples will have a good effect indeed our fellows behaved as well 
on the occasion as I could wish -
</p><p>
I have not only spoke to Doctor MlKenzie but advised him to wait on you I know if he can get an appointment as Director or Chief Surgeon to the Corps he will gladly stay with you 
the Campaign I also saw Doctor Skinner this day, who told me he would go & stay with Butler as his Surgeon By order of His Excellency the 
Officers will meet this morning to devise some plan or consult what will be best to do about 
the disputed Inlistments which is the pretended cause of all this Mischief General Smallwood has now got a fellow Confined who formerly 
Deserted from us to the Enemy came out lately & claimed the benefit of His Excellencys Proclamation was pardoned Went to the Maryland 
line and there Inlisted several men for the King of England Six of Whom all of one Reg 1 , actually went off & others who detected him 
were to meet him in the Mountains leading to Haverstraw where he said he had hard Money hid Notwithstanding all this has been plumply 
proven by many Evidences it is thought he wilt escape with a hun d . lashes, Should this be the case & a practice made of letting off such 
atrocious offenders there is an end of Service we may as well drop the matter & discharge all at once with some Grace however this I scarce 
think possible, and hope shold such a stupid sentence have taken place the General will not think of Confirming it.

I am Dear Gen'l 
</p><p>
Yours Sincerely
