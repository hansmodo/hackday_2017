MY PRESENT communication will be a chapter on the Indians. I hesitated whether I would expose one of Colonel Grant's mountain rambles, together with Captain King's adventure, but I finally concluded to leave persons and adventures until my next. My opportunity of seeing the dark-skinned aborigines has been somewhat extended within a few months, and this may diversify the thousand and one California communications with which we are boring our Atlantic brethren. I am at present living in immediate proximity of two large Indian villages, where the night revels of these poor savages, together with the howling of the coyote, are my evening lullaby, while during the day I am waited on or stared at as a great "medicine man" by a gaping crowd of credulous Indians. God help my practice as a physician. Beyond putting a plaster (if I have it) on a sore toe, or offering a bottle of hartshorn to a fainting person, my practice does not extend, and the veriest pepper quack in the land might blush to own me as one of the faculty. I found the chief (Oleepa) sitting by his fire one night, holding his head with his hand, evidently suffering with pain. On examination, I found a slight swelling just back and a little below his ear. I saw at once it

was simply a slight inflammation, which would produce suppuration unless it could be reduced. I had scarcely any medicines with me, but I knew that opodeldoc was good for horseflesh, and I thought it might do for Indians; so I rubbed a little on it, gave him a pill of opium, and sent him to bed. In two days the swelling was gone and the chief well, and my credit as "high as the skies" as a "medicine man;" and I have a full run of practice, which I extend free gratis for nothing. One poor devil came to me with a sore skin. Having no Peleg White or Jew David by me, I washed it clean with Castile soap, put a thin piece of fat bacon on a rag and bound it on the happy Indian's leg, and told him he would be well in three sleeps. It would have got well anyhow. Bacon is good for the inside of a white man, so I though it might do outside on an Indian. But I will brag no more of my medical talents until I invent some patent medicine, and then I will send you any quantity of Indian certificates to prove that a man will never need employ me but once, for I shall kill him the first time. I have had considerable curiosity in finding out their customs and for this purpose have been a good deal among them. Their houses resemble coal pits, being a framework within an excavation in the ground and the dirt thrown over it, a hole being left in the top for the smoke to go out, and another about two feet square at the bottom to serve as a door: this is by a passage four or five feet long, and it is close work to get in by crawling on your hands and knees. Once in, they are quite capacious, but dingy with smoke, and filthy. I have frequently crawled in and sat by their fires in the cool evenings, and I have always been well treated, and at any time when they have been eating, was always invited to a share. Their bread is made of acorns pounded fine and dried, and they make a cake of a kind of grass by boiling it first, then working it over with their hands into a pulpy substance, flattening it out and drying it over their fires. Both are very palatable, aside from their dirty mode of preparing it. Their mode of cooking the beautiful salmon caught here makes them delicious; it is simply by laying heated stones upon them until they are thoroughly cooked. I like them better than any other mode I ever tried. Men and women generally wear their hair short, shaved quite close on the top of the head. I have been amused at their mode of cutting hair; sometimes they burn it off with a coal and sometimes turn it over a flat stick and saw it off with the edge of a clam shell.
</p><p>
In intelligence, they are far behind the Indians east of the Rocky Mountains. Unless they have been employed by the whites so as to obtain clothes, they go naked, the men entirely so, and the women wear only a short apron of grass before them.
</p><p>
They have some idea of a Superior Being or Spirit greater than themselves, but have few, if any, religious ceremonies. The moon is an object of veneration, and they occasionally give her a dance offering. They are fond of dancing and often indulge in it without any other visible object than that of pleasure. Their music is a monotonous cadence of guttural sounds to which they keep time with their feet. It is somewhat singular that different rancherías, though only four and five miles apart, speak different dialects, though there appears to be a common means or general language of communication among the different tribes.
</p><p>
Each village has its separate chief whose government is of the most liberal, patriarchal kind. Different tribes have different customs: in their burials, some burn their dead, some bury them extended at full length, covering them with skins or sticks, then throwing in dirt; while others bend the body and legs together in a sitting posture, winding them up tightly with cords, and then place them into holes in the ground, putting in water, provisions, and little mementos of affection to serve them on their way to the land of spirits.
</p><p>
An affecting anecdote was related me by an eyewitness of a burial among one of the mountain tribes. Mr. Johnson, late proprietor of the ranch which bears his name on Bear River, brought up a boy and girl from childhood. They were educated as well as the circumstances of the country would allow, and while the girl was instructed in the domestic arts, the boy was learned in the science of agriculture. Both were trusty, and Mr. Johnson was much attached to them. In the course of time they arrived to a marriageable age, and the boy wanted a wife. Mr. Johnson proposed that he should take the girl, which being perfectly agreeable to their inclination, they were married. In a year or two the boy was taken sick and died. Mr. J. desired to have a somewhat expensive funeral to testify his regard for his adopted children, but the poor girl begged him to let her bury her beloved husband beside the bones of her father in the hills. Of course he at once consented, and he with all his domestics and several friends escorted the body to the mountains, where they were met by the rude mountaineers with every demonstration of sorrow, who placed the body on a pile and set fire to it. They then began to dance around it with songs of lamentation, each casting into the flames some precious offering, while the widow stripped herself completely of her civilized garments, threw them into the fire, and Mr. Johnson's domestics each pulled off their new hats, which he had just paid eighteen dollars apiece for, and cast them on
the burning pile of the deceased fellow and friend. When all was consumed, the Indians gathered up the ashes in their hands and scattered them to the winds.
</p><p>
When the ceremony was concluded, Mr. Johnson told the girl that her mule was ready and they would return, but she refused to go: "My husband, my heart, is dead; I will stay in the mountains with him; I will watch his ashes on the hills and his spirit will be with me; I am an Indian now; I love you, my father, but I will go no more to the Valley; I will be an Indian till I die." It was in vain that she was promised clothes, a life of ease and comfort and the wants of savage life exhibited to her. She would not go. "Her heart was here now. His bones were with her father's. Hers should be with his." She assumed the usual grass apron worn by the squaws and remains with them now.
</p><p>
Their marriage customs vary in different tribes. Some buy their wives of their parents. Some steal them from other tribes, while some have a kind of hide-and-go-seek game. The lover asks the parents for their daughter. They tell him if he can find her three times she is his. In the meantime she secretes herself and the young man begins the search. If he finds her twice in succession, she is his. If he fails the third time, some weeks of probation is required before he ia allowed another trial. They are very affectionate and kind to each other, sharing gifts freely. I have often tested this. One day two Indians came to my tent and I gave one of them a small cracker. He immediately broke it and gave half to his companion. I employed one for a day or two and at noon took him home to dinner, which I gave him on a plate by himself. In the meantime two other Indians came up and commenced eating with him as a matter of course, and the three dispatched the dinner of one, and all appeared to be perfectly satisfied with the arrangement.
</p><p>
They seem to have no idea of chastity, but they are so abominably filthy that their appearance excites disgust rather than passion. Still some of the old settlers use the women as wives and become attached to them.
</p><p>
Gambling is a universal propensity. They play a game with short sticks cut equal lengths, a kind of odd-and-even game, and they frequently stake all their valuables, which they win or lose with perfect apparent indifference. An Indian may be loaded with strings of beads suspended from his naked neck today, and tomorrow they may be the property of, and won by, another. Notwithstanding their affection for each other, they readily part with their children. In passing through one of the villages a day or two since, I noticed a fine plump little fellow tugging lustily at its mother's breast. I stopped and playfully patted the child upon its cheek. Instantly a tall, naked Indian who was basking in the sun on top of his mud castle, sprang up and offered me the child for a handkerchief which
was tied around my shoulders. I laughed and told him the baby was too small; I could put it in my pockets; but when he could run about I would trade. They laughed in turn and told me he would then be worth more.
</p><p>
They beg without scruple or shame. A few days since I was sitting among a crowd, when one of them asked me for my handkerchief. He wanted it to wear on his head.
</p><p>
"O, no!" I told him. "I cannot spare it--I want it to wipe my nose with." "Ugh! you have a hat (pointing to mine) and I have none. You can blow your nose as I do," and suiting the action to the word, turned a triumphant look upon me, as much as to say, "I have learned you something, old fellow," and the whole crowd laughed merrily at my ignorance. What a barbarian I am. Well, my education must be my excuse. There are many other incidents to illustrate Indian character but it would make too long a letter, and I will close by a single anecdote illustrating their credulity, if my medical practice is not sufficient.
