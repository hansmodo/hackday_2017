DEAR SIR, The step taken by New Jersey was certainly a 
rash one, and will furnish fresh pretexts to unwilling States for 
withholding their contributions. In one point of view, however, it furnishes a salutary lesson. Is it possible, with such an 
example before our eyes of impotency in the federal system, to 
remain sceptical with regard to the necessity of infusing more energy into it? A Government cannot long stand which is 
obliged, in the ordinary course of its administration, to court a 
compliance with its constitutional acts, from a member not of 
the most powerful order, situated within the immediate verge 
of authority, and apprised of every circumstance which should 
remonstrate against disobedience. 
</p><p>
The question whether it be possible and worth while to preserv.the Union of the States must be speedily decided some 
way or other. Those who are indifferent to its preserv.ion 
would do well to look forward to the consequences of its extinction. The prospect to my eye is a gloomy one indeed. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear that the opposition to the impost is likely 
to be overcome. It is an encouragement to persevere in good 
measures. I am afraid, at the same time, that, like other auxiliary resources, it will be overrated by the States, and slacken 
the regular efforts of taxation. It is also materially short of 
the power which Congress ought to have with regard to trade. 
It leaves the door unshut against a commercial warfare among 
the States, our trade exposed to foreign machinations, and the 
distresses of an unfavorable balance very little checked. The 
experience of European Merchants who have speculated in our 
trade will probably check, in a great measure, our opportunities 
of consuming beyond our resources; but they will continue to 
credit us as far as our coin, in addition to our productions, will 
extend, and our experience here teaches us that our people will 
extend their consumption as far as credit can be obtained.
