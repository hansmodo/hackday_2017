<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='5'>5th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. We stood on the balcony to see our Confederate flag go up. Roars of cannqn, etc., etc. Miss Sanders 
complained (so said Captain Ingraham) of the deadness of the mob. "It was utterly spiritless", she said "no cheering, or so little, and no enthusiasm." Captain Ingraham suggested that gentlemen " are apt to be quiet," and this 
was " a thoughtful crowd, the true mob element with us just now is hoeing corn." And yet! It is uncomfortable 
that the idea has gone abroad that we have no joy, no 
pride, in this thing. The band was playing Massa in the cold, cold ground. Miss Tyler, daughter of the former 
President of the United States, ran up the flag.

Captain Ingraham pulled out of his pocket some verses sent to him by a Boston girl. They were well rhymed and 
amounted to this: she held a rope ready to hang him, 
though she shed tears when she remembered his heroic rescue of Koszta. Koszta, the rebel ! She calls us rebels, too. 
So it depends upon whom one rebels against whether to save or not shall be heroic.

I must read <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> inaugural. Oh, " comes he in peace, or comes he in war, or to tread but one measure as 
Young Lochinvar? " <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> aim is to seduce the border States.

The people, the natives, I mean, are astounded that I calmly affirm, in all truth and candor, that if there were 
awful things in society in Washington, I did not see or hear of them. One must have been hard to please who did 
not like the people I knew in Washington.

Mr. Chesnut has gone with a list of names to the President de Treville, Kershaw, Baker, and Robert Rutledge. 
They are taking a walk, I see. I hope there will be good places in the army for our list.
