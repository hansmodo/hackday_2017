[TO SYLVANUS BOURNE]

</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Mr. Johnson sent me a few days ago your favor of the 1st instant, inclosing the letter of Mr. Roos. I shall accordingly procure for him a copying press, with a considerable 
quantity of the paper and ink-powder. The directions for 
making the ink and for using the press are both in French 
and English, and must be attentively observed. I shall 
perhaps bring the press over with me, as I expect to return 
in the course of a few weeks. If, however, an earlier opportunity to send it shall offer, I will embrace it. 
</p><p>
The most recent accounts from America contain the usual 
mixture of sweet and bitter, but with more than an ordinary 
quantity of both ingredients. The attack upon the President is still carried on with that virulence and brutality 
which have uniformly been characteristic of an American 
party mingling with a foreign influence. Mr. Randolph, I 
suppose, means to come forward with his publication at the 
moment when Congress shall meet. The depredations by 
the Bermuda privateers continue to irritate and fester the 
public mind, and the present session of the national legislature will doubtless produce great heats, and perhaps animosities ; though I hope not any dangerous divisions. 
</p><p>
It is not a little remarkable that this is the critical situation of our country at a moment when the national prosperity 
continues to grow with a luxuriance of which the annals of the world give no example. One would think our people 
determined to dash the cup of happiness from their own lips, merely because it overflows. To give you an instance of 
our commercial state, a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> newspaper of October 14, states that within the month preceding that date, one hundred sail of vessels had entered there from foreign ports. 
It is said here to be unquestionable, that the exports from 
the United States during the year ending September 30, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>, amounted to more than thirty-five millions of dollars. 
When we recollect that at the same date only four years 
before, one half of this sum was considered as the proof of 
some extraordinary cause, which would not be supported 
to an equal extent during the years subsequent, is it possible 
to avoid the reflection, that the American government, and 
the President in particular, do not meet with that retribution which has been richly deserved? At the present moment if our neutrality be still preserved, it will be due to the 
President alone. Nothing but his weight of character and 
reputation, combined with his firmness and political intrepidity, could have stood against the torrent that is still 
tumbling with a fury that resounds even across the Atlantic. 
He is now pledged, and he is unmoved. If his system of ad 
ministration now prevails, ten years more will place the 
United States among the most powerful and opulent nations 
on earth. If he fails, though the Demon of Discord may 
raise a cloud of prejudice and obloquy around the splendor 
of his fame for the present moment, it will only serve to add 
a brighter radiance to his future glory. Yet I deprecate this 
event because the value of his administration will in that 
case be proved by the deprivation of the blessings it has 
secured to his country. 
</p><p>
This, my good friend, is not the language of a courtier. 
You and I have known the time when not to applaud the man 
who united all hearts was almost held to be a crime. Should 
that time return again while he lives, my tribute of veneration and gratitude shall again remain silent in my heart. 
But now, when he does not unite all hearts, when on the contrary a powerful party at home, and a mighty influence from 
abroad, are joining all their forces to assail his reputation and his character, I think it my duty as an American to 
avow my sentiments as they concern that man. 
</p><p>
You know, I suppose, that in the course of the last sum 
mer a peace was concluded with all the western Indians. 
The last papers mention the receipt of official news of the 
peace with the Algerines. In addition to these may be 
reckoned the successful issue of Mr. Pinckney's negotiation 
in Spain. In this country a relaxation from the rigor of 
their navigation laws has already become inevitable, if they 
remain at war, and we at peace. Here are objects secured 
by our neutrality, and by that alone. Compare them with 
the most advantageous issue that a war might by any possibility have had, and tell me what you think of those who still 
hesitate about the choice? Though by the way, I suspect 
the Algerine peace is to be abused, and we are to be told it might have been had upon infinitely better terms. 
</p><p>
There is another pretty story current, arising from the 
same source, but which it is to be feared will now lose its 
use. It is, that when France and Spain were negotiating 
their late peace, one of the articles insisted on by the former 
was navigation of the Mississippi for us. But upon Mr. Pinckney's going through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> without communicating to 
the French government Mr. Jay's treaty, the Committee of 
Public Safety immediately sent orders to Barthelemy to 
give up that point. I have this account as coming from the 
express knowledge of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague">Mr. Monroe</a>. Had Mr. Pinckney failed, 
what a charming anecdote this was to make the treaty with 
Britain odious, and to give a lift to the influence of France. 
But alas ! when the generous bounty of the Committee 
was withdrawn, it seems the United States could obtain the 
same thing on their own account. But perhaps, indeed, the 
tale will be worth keeping up, to show what France would 
have done for us, if we had been good children. 
</p><p>
It is on this ground that the treaty with Algiers is to be 
blamed. I know nothing of the circumstances attending 
that negotiation; but I perceive that a great deal of credit 
is meant to be given to the French government for what they 
would have done for us in that matter, if time had been given 
them, and, therefore, I conclude they had little or no hand 
in what was done. 
</p><p>
That the Americans now in France should love the French 
nation and admire the French Republic, is natural and rational. They are a most amiable people. Few Americans 
have had an opportunity to be more acquainted with what 
they formerly were than I have, and if I do not look on them 
as the first people on the face of the globe, it is only because 
I have a country. The American people are under obligations to France. I acknowledge them and would have them 
repaid with honor and generosity : nor can I dissent from the 
feelings of gratitude which actuate so strongly our country 
men in France on that account. But if there are Americans 
who have considered speculation in the funds of the United 
States as almost a disqualification for political opinions, and 
those very Americans have speculated in the funds of the 
French Revolution, I think it would become them to be moderate in their panegyrics, or expect that their opinions will be taken with a grain of allowance. 
</p><p>
I remain &c 
</p><p>
