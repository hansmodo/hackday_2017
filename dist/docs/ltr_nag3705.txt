Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 14th, appointing 
me to the command of the Southern army, was delivered me last evening. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency to be persuaded that I am 
fully sensible of the honor you do me, and will endeavour to manifest my gratitude by a conduct that 
will not disgrace the appointment. I only lament 
that my abilities are not more competent to the 
duties that will be required of me, and that it will 
not be in my power, on that account, to be as extensively useful as my inclination leads me to wish. 
But, as far as zeal and attention can supply the defect, I flatter myself my country will have little 
cause to complain. I foresee the command will be 
accompanied with innumerable embarrassments. But 
the generous support which I expect from the partiality of the southern gentlemen, as well as the aid 
and assistance I hope to derive from your Excellency's advice and extensive influence, affords me 
some consolation in contemplating the difficulties. 
</p><p>
I will prepare myself for the command as soon as 
I can. But, as I have been five years and upwards in service, during all which time I have paid no attention to the settlement of my domestic concerns 
(and many divisions of interest, and partition of landed property, between me and my brothers, have taken 
place in the time, and now lie unfinished), if it was 
possible, I should be glad to spend a few days at 
home, before I set out to the southward, especially 
as it is altogether uncertain how long my command 
may continue, or what deaths or accidents may happen, during my absence, to defeat the business. I 
beg your Excellency's opinion upon the matter, by 
which I will regulate my conduct. However, it will 
not be possible for me to leave this place for several 
days, if I put my baggage in the least order, or my 
business in a proper train for such a long journey. 
Nor is my health in a condition to set out immediately, having had a considerable fever upon me for 
several days. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague met'>General Heath</a> arrived last evening, and will take 
the command this morning. I shall make him fully 
acquainted with all the dispositions I have made, and 
steps taken, which concern the post and its dependencies j and will give him my opinion what further 
is necessary to be done, to carry into execution your 
Excellency's instructions for putting the garrison in 
a proper state of defence, and prepare it for the approaching winter. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague met'>General McDougall</a> is also here, and I have the 
pleasure to inform you that he and I perfectly agree 
in sentiment in what concerns the garrison and its 
dependencies. I am, &c.
