My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have read with attention your kind favour of the 2d inst., and have frequently had occasion to discuss 
the subject matter of it. I have more than once contended, that supposing the Congress should be guilty 
of the greatest injustice towards the officers of the army, a general abandonment of the service at this 
perilous crisis, the consequences of which must evidently be the ruin of our cause, would merit eternal 
infamy. A majority, composed perhaps only of ten men, conduct the present system, will you, to punish them for acting either unadvisedly or even with ill 
design, sacrifice the liberties of America, and desperately involve yourselves in the perdition which 
you bring upon them? That man, however injured by the representatives of the people, who will desert the public interest, is destitute of virtue and unworthy to be free. 
</p><p>
I must confess to you, with grief, my dearest friend, 
that upon a nearer view, I have a far less respectable 
idea of my countrymen than when I beheld their 
struggle from afar, and could not distinguish the vices 
with which they are oppressed. I was thunderstruck 
at hearing a system adopted of governing men by 
their vices, and putting public virtue and patriotism 
out of the question, as nonentities, a system so subversive of republicanism that if it prevails, we may bid adieu to our liberties. 
</p><p>
Before I received your letter, I was generally against 
the pensionary half pay establishment, but had not 
seen in their full extent the inconveniences that would 
arise from it. You have developed some ideas that 
had but slightly and feebly presented themselves to 
me, and have confirmed my opinion ; but, at the same 
time that I require such virtue in those of the army, 
as to esteem the loss of estate a cheap price to pay for 
the honour of establishing the liberties of their country, 
I would wish the burthens of society as equally distributed as possible, that there may not be one part of 
the community appropriating to itself the summit of 
wealth and grandeur, while another is reduced to 
extreme indigence in the common cause. By what 
means this is to be effected wise legislators must 
determine. The power of our enemies and their perfection in the military science, opposed to our inexperience, seem to render it impolitic to arrive at this by 
alternation in military service. Our safety requires 
that we should retain those officers and soldiers who 
are most enured to arms, in order to oppose veterans. 
Can it be effected by taxes on luxuries, which would 
be felt only by the rich ? In a republic there ought 
to be the penalties of sumptuary laws, and should be 
so severe as to amount to a prohibition ; consequently 
no fund could be established by these means, to 
answer any extensive purpose. 
If we were as virtuous as we ought to be, we should 
have those who are enriching themselves by commerce, privateering and farming, supplying the army 
with every necessary convenience at a moderate rate ; 
but as experience proves that it is in vain to expect this, 
all I would demand of Congress, is that they would 
contrive some means of furnishing us with articles 
which nature cannot forego, and which are useful in 
giving respectability to the military state, at such 
prices as bear some proportion to our pay. 
</p><p>
I would wish to see the military state rendered 
honorable, and all odious distinctions of jealousy laid 
aside, for we are all citizens, and have no separate 
interests. If mediocrity could be established Gen. rally, by any means, it would be well ; it would ensure 
us virtue and render our independency permanent. 
But there never will be virtue in the poor, when there 
are rich in the same community. By imperceptible 
and indirect methods, we should labour to establish 
and maintain equality of fortunes as much as possible, 
if we would continue to be free. 
</p><p>
It is a fact that our officers cannot satisfy the simple 
wants of nature, much less make that appearance 
which is annexed to the military state, with their pay. 
It is no less a fact that in every town on the continent, 
luxury nourishes as it would among a people who had 
conquered the world, and were about to pay for their 
victories, by their decline. This I hope Congress will 
take seriously into consideration. 
</p><p>
I would by no means wish our pay to be increased, 
but I would wish to see temptations to peculation in 
weak men removed, and the honest man delivered 
from the necessity of reducing himself to beggary. 
This will best be effected by a public establishment 
for supplying wants at a moderate price. 
</p><p>
I have received your favour, inclosing a note for Bringhurst, which will be sent to him by the first good opportunity. 
</p><p>
Your favour of the 9th is just received, with the blue 
cloth and the buttons, for which I return you my best 
thanks. The last paragraph makes me the more 
uneasy, as I do not know in what way we are menaced 
and what is the extent of the danger. 
</p><p>
"We have heard nothing from our commissioners 
since their arrival at New Town, from whence WQ 
conclude that they are going on well. They were 
exceedingly chagrined at the distrust of their abilities 
which was conspicuous in the resolves of Congress. 
They had been perfectly satisfied with the prospects 
which they had at their first interview, at German 
Town. 
</p><p>
Inclosed you will receive the Kutledge papers. 
The General has been so much occupied that I 
have not given them him to read, and though he 
has got over his great business of a long official 
letter, I fear to detain them any longer. Altho he 
is an advocate for the half pay establishment, on the 
principles of economy and justice to the officers, I 
apprehend that if any other mode were proposed 
for rendering commissions honorable, and enabling 
the officers to subsist with decency, he is not inviolably attached to this.

Your most affectionate

My best respects to <a href='/results.php?tla=wid' rel=''>Mr. Drayton</a> ; I will be looking 
out for quarters for him.
