My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I think that you should be acquainted with a fact, which it is 
very important to communicate to our Secretary of State as 
soon as may be. I am informed, in a way that precludes 
doubt, that the Executive Council here sent out by M. Genet 
three hundred blank commissions for privateers, to be given 
clandestinely to such persons as he might find in America inclined to take them. They suppose that the avidity of some 
adventurers may lead them into measures, which would involve 
altercations with Great Britain, and terminate finally in a war. 
This appears to me, waving all question of honesty, no very 
sound measure politically speaking, since they may, as a 
nation, derive greater advantage from our neutrality than from 
our alliance. 
</p><p>
But whatever light it may be viewed in as to them, it is in 
respect to us a detestable project. I learn that some seamen have lately by British cruisers, who claim to be Americans. I presume that the claim will not be admitted, but if 
the government should cause them to be executed as Pirates, 
a knowledge thereof would go a great way to prevent our citizens from engaging in a war, contrary to the wishes of 
our government, especially if, as I doubt not, the President 
should by proclamation, enjoining the observance of a strict 
neutrality, declare that all those who contravene shall be at the 
mercy of the party by whom they may be taken, and not en 
titled to the protection of the United States. 
</p><p>
I am the more solicitous on this subject, in that we may 
well expect a back game of the same kind by Britain, and in 
such case it would be impossible for the French to distinguish 
among their prisoners, between those who were and those who 
were not English. As there is nothing more destructive to 
morals than the spirit of gambling, especially when murder is 
placed among the means of gaining the property of others, 
and as the security and happiness of the United States depend 
so essentially on the morals of their citizens, I feel a more 
than usual solicitude to prevent a practice inconsistent with all 
good principles. 
</p><p>
I have no late news from America, and none of any date which you would with to know. Our Secretary of State seems 
much attached to brevity, and reminds me of a maxim of his predecessor, that least said is soonest mended. The length 
of this letter will show you that I have not profited by such wise lessons, but it will also show you, I trust, the confidential esteem with which I am, &c.
