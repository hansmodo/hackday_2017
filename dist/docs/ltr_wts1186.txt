HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,

Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I am again in the midst of trouble, occasioned by a 
telegram from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> saying that the order is out for me 
to come to the command of the military division of the 
Atlantic Headquarters at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. The President 
repeatedly asked me to accept of some such position, but 
I thought I had fought it off successfully, though he 
again and again reverted to it. 
</p><p>
Now, it seems, he has ordered it, and it is full of 
trouble for me. I wrote him one or two letters in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> which I thought positive enough, but have 
now written another, and if it fails in its object I 
might as well cast about for new employment. The 
result would be certain conflict resulting in Grant's violent deposition, mine, or the President's. 
</p><p>
There is not room on board of one ship for more than 
one captain. 
</p><p>
If Grant intends to run for President I should be willing to come on, because my duties would then be so 
clearly defined that I think I could steer clear of the 
breakers, but now it would be impossible. The President would make use of me to beget violence, a condition 
of things that ought not to exist now. 
</p><p>
He has no right to use us for such purposes, though he 
is Commander-in-Chief. I did suppose his passage with 
Grant would end there, but now it seems he will fight 
him as he has been doing Congress. I don't object if 
he does so himself and don't rope me in. ... 
</p><p>
If the President forces me into a false position out of 
seeming favor, I must defend myself. It is mortifying, 
but none the less inevitable. Affectionately, 
</p><p>
