Yesterday we arrived ; I thought we should never get here. Monday we had almost given up in despair, believing the schooner would never return. 
But in the evening, when all were gathered in our room discussing our hopes and fears, a sail was perceived at the mouth of the bayou, whereupon every 
one rushed out to see the boat land. I believe that I have not mentioned that this <a href='/results.php?city=madisonville' rel='city'>Bonfouca</a> is on a bayou 
of the same name that runs within a few yards of this house. It is an Indian name signifying Winding River, which struck us as very appropriate when we 
watched the schooner sailing now to the left, now to the right, apparently through the green fields; for 
the high grass hid the course of the stream so that the faintest line was not perceptible, except just in 
front of the house. All was now bustle and confusion, packing, dressing, and writing last words to our 
friends at home, until half-past eleven, when we embarked. 
</p><p>
This is my first experience of schooners, and I Don't care if I never behold another. The cabin where 
Mr. Kennedy immediately carried me, was just the size of my bed at home (in the days I had a home) and 
just high enough to stand in. On each side of the short ladder, there was a mattress two feet wide. 
</p><p>
One of them Mrs. R had possession of already, the other was reserved for me. I gave the lower part 
of mine to Minna and Jennie, who spent the rest of the night fighting each other and kicking me. 
</p><p>
Just before twelve we "weighed anchor" and I 
went on deck to take a last look at Dixie with the 
rest of the party. Every heart was full. Each left 
brothers, sisters, husband, children, or dear friends 
behind. We sang, " Farewell dear land," with a slight 
quaver in our voices, looked at the beautiful starlight 
shining on the last boundary of our glorious land, and, 
fervently and silently praying, passed out of sight. 
God bless you, all you dear ones we have left in 
our beloved country! God bless and prosper you, 
and grant you the victory in the name of Jesus 
Christ. 
</p><p>
I returned to my mattress, and this is the way we spent the night. 
</p><p>
Mrs. R , rocking and moaning as she sat up in bed, whined out her various ills with a minute description of each, ceasing the recital only to talk of 
her son's body which lay on deck. (Yesterday morning she was sitting crying on his coffin while a strange 
woman sat on its head eating her bread and cheese.) 
Mrs. Bull, one of the most intelligent and refined ladies I have yet met, who is perfectly devoted to 
me, sat by me, laughing and talking, trying her best to make every one comfortable and happy in her 
unobtrusive way. Mother talked to Mrs. R and cried at the thought of leaving her children fighting 
and suffering. The space between the two beds was 
occupied by three Irishwomen and Mrs. Ivy's two 
babies. The babies had commenced screaming as 
they were brought into the pen, at which I was not 
surprised. Having pitched their voices on the proper 
key, they never ceased shrieking, kicking, crying, 
throwing up, and going through the whole list of 
baby performances. The nurses scolded with shrill 
voices above the bedlam that had hushed even Mrs. R -'s complaints; Jennie and Minna quarreled, 
kicked, and cried ; and as an aggravation to the previous discomforts, a broad-shouldered, perspiring 
Irishwoman sat just by my head, bracing herself 
against my pillow in the most unpleasant style. I 
endured it without flinching until about half-past 
three, when the condensed odor of a dozen different 
people and children became unendurable, and I staggered up on deck where Miriam and Mrs. Ivy had 
been wise enough to remain without venturing be 
low. They laid me on a bench in the stern, rolled me 
up in shawls to keep off the heavy dew, and there I 
remained until daylight with them, as wide awake 
as ever. 
</p><p>
At daylight there was a universal smoothing of 
heads, and straightening of dresses, besides arrangements made for the inspection of baggage. Being 
unwilling for any Christian to see such a book as 
this, I passed a piece of tape through the centre 
leaves, and made Miriam tie it under her hoops. At 
sunrise we were in sight of the houses at the lake 
end. It seemed as though we would never reach 
land. 
</p><p>
I forgot to speak of our alarm as we got in the lake. 
No sooner had we fairly left the bayou than the 
sky suddenly became threatening. The captain 
shook his head and spoke of a very ugly night for the 
lake, which sent everybody's heart to their throats, 
and alarmed us immeasurably. We got talking of 
the sailor's superstition of crossing the water with a 
corpse, until we persuaded ourselves that it was 
more than probable we would founder in the coming 
storm. But the severest storm we met was the one 
in the cabin ; and all night the only wind was a head 
breeze, and the spicy gale from below. 
</p><p>
When we at last entered the canal, I beheld the 
animal now so long unseen, the Yankee. In their 
dark blue uniforms, they stood around, but I thought 
of the dear gray coats, and even the pickets of 
<a href='/results.php?city=madisonville' rel='city'>Madisonville</a> seemed nobler and greater men than 
these. Immediately a guard was placed on board, 
we whispering before he came, "Our dear Confederates, God bless them." 
</p><p>
We had agreed among ourselves that come what 
would, we would preserve our dignity and self-respect, and do anything rather than create a scene 
among such people. It is well that we agreed. So 
we whispered quietly among ourselves, exhorting 
each other to pay no attention to the remarks the 
Yankees made about us as we passed, and acting the 
martyr to perfection, until we came to Hickock's Landing. Here there was a group of twenty Yankees. Two officers came up and asked us for papers ; 
we said we had none. In five minutes one came back, 
and asked if we had taken the oath. No; we had 
never taken any. He then took down our names. 
Mother was alone in the coop. He asked if there was 
not another. The schooner had fifteen passengers, 
and we had given only fourteen names. Mother then 
came up and gave her name, going back soon 
after. 
</p><p>
While one went after our passes, others came to 
examine our baggage. I could not but smile as an 
unfortunate young man got on his knees before our 
trunk and respectfully handled our dirty petticoats 
and stockings. "You have gone through it before," 
he said. "Of course, the Confederates searched it." 
-"Indeed, they did not touch it!" I exclaimed. 
"They never think of doing such work." - "Miss, 
it is more mortifying to me than it can be to you," he 
answered. And I saw he was actually blushing. He 
did his work as delicately as possible, and when he 
returned the keys, asked if we had letters. I opened 
my box and put them into his hand. One came near 
getting me into serious trouble. It was sent by some 
one I never saw, with the assurance that it contained 
nothing objectionable. I gave it sealed to the man, 
who opened it, when it proved to be rather disagree 
able, I judged from his language. He told me his 
captain must see it before he could let me have it, 
and carried it off. Presently he came back and told 
me it could not be returned. I told him to burn it 
then, as I neither knew the writer, the contents, nor 
those it was written to. "I may save you some difficulty if I destroy it," he remarked, whereupon he 
tore it up and flung it into the canal. I have since 
found I had cause to be grateful; for just after came 
an officer to see the young lady who brought that 
letter. I showed the pieces in the water, saying the 
young man had torn it up, which seemed to annoy 
him ; it was to be sent to headquarters, he said. 
</p><p>
Then came a bundle of papers on board carried by another, who standing in front of us, cried in a 
startling way, "Sarah Morgan!" "Here" (very quietly). "Stand up!" " I cannot" (firmly). - "Why not?" "Unable" (decisively). After this 
brief dialogue, he went on with the others until all were standing except myself, when he delivered to 
each a strip of paper that informed the people that Miss, or Mrs. So-and-So had taken and subscribed 
the oath as Citizen of the United States. I thought that was all, and rejoiced at our escape. But after 
another pause he uncovered his head and told us to hold up our right hands. Half-crying, I covered my 
face with mine and prayed breathlessly for the boys and the Confederacy, so that I heard not a word he 
was saying until the question, "So help you God?" struck my ear. I shuddered and prayed harder. 
There came an awful pause in which not a lip was moved. Each felt as though in a nightmare, until, 
throwing down his blank book, the officer pronounced it "All right!" Strange to say, I experienced no change. I prayed as hard as ever for the 
boys and our country, and felt no nasty or disagreeable feeling which would have announced the process of turning Yankee. 
</p><p>
Then it was that mother commenced. He turned 
to the mouth of the diminutive cave, and asked if 
she was ready to take the oath. "I suppose I have 
to, since I belong to you," she replied. " No, madam, 
you are not obliged ; we force no one. Can you state 
your objections?" "Yes, I have three sons fighting 
against you, and you have robbed me, beggared me ! " 
she exclaimed, launching into a speech in which 
Heaven knows what she did not say ; there was little 
she left out, from her despoiled house to her sore 
hand, both of which she attributed to the at first 
amiable man, who was rapidly losing all patience. 
Faint with hunger, dizzy with sleeplessness, she had 
wrought on her own feelings until her nerves were 
beyond control. She was determined to carry it out, 
and crying and sobbing went through with it. 
</p><p>
I neither spoke nor moved. . . . The officer walked 
off angrily and sent for a guard to have mother taken 
before General Bo wens. Once through her speech, 
mother yielded to the entreaties of the ladies and professed herself ready to take the oath, since she was 
obliged to. "Madam, I did not invite you to come," 
said the polite officer, who refused to administer the 
oath; and putting several soldiers on board, ordered 
them to keep all on board until one could report to 
General Bowens. Mother retired to the cabin, while 
we still kept our seats above. 
</p><p>
Oh, that monotonous, never-ending canal! We 
thought it would go on forever. At last we came to 
the basin in the centre of the city. Here was a position for ladies ! Sitting like Irish emigrants on their 
earthly possessions, and coming in a schooner to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, which a year ago would have filled 
us with horror. Again the landing was reached, 
and again we were boarded by officers. I don't 
know how they knew of the difficulty mother had 
made, but they certainly did, and ordered that 
none should leave until the General's will was made 
known. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Bull and Mrs. Ivy, after a long delay and 
many representations, at last prepared to leave. I 
was sitting in the spot I had occupied ever since be 
fore daylight, with nothing to support me above my 
hips. All of us had fasted since an early and light 
supper the night before ; none had slept. I was growing so weak from these three causes, and the burning 
sun (for it was now twelve), that I could hardly 
speak when they came to tell me good-bye. Alarmed 
at my appearance, Mrs. Bull entreated the officer to 
allow me to leave the boat. No, he said ; it was impossible; we should remain on board until General Bowens could come. We may get an answer in half 
an hour, or we may not get it for some time; and 
there we must stay until it came. "But this young 
lady has been ill for months; she is perfectly exhausted, and will faint if she is not removed immediately," pleaded Mrs. Bull. She did not know my 
powers of control. Faint! I would have expired 
silently first! The officer said those were his orders; 
I could not leave. "Do you think you are performing your duty as a gentleman and a Christian? This 
young lady has obtained her pass already, without 
the slightest difficulty," she persisted. Still he said 
he was acting according to orders. Not to be baffled, 
she begged that she might be allowed to take me to 
Brother, telling him who he was, while our trunk, 
Miriam, Tiche, and mother would remain as hostages. Then he gave a reluctant consent on condition I left my number, so he could go after me when 
I was wanted. 
</p><p>
I don't know what good came of the consent, for 
there I was to remain until something, I don't know 
what, happened. I only know I was growing deathly 
sick and faint, and could hardly hold myself up, 
when some time after Mrs. Bull and Mrs. Ivy left 
(under the impression that I was to go immediately), 
a gentleman in citizen's clothes came to me and said 
he had obtained permission for me to wait General Bowens's orders in his office, a few steps from the 
schooner. Thankful for so much, I accepted his arm 
and slowly dragged myself along to the first shelter 
I had seen that day. By some wonderful condescension Miriam and mother were allowed to follow; and 
with the guard at the door, we waited there for half 
an hour more until our sentence could be received. 
</p><p>
Miriam had written a line to Brother as soon as 
possible, telling him of the situation, and while we 
were waiting in this office, I half dead with fatigue, 
a carriage dashed up to the door, and out of it stepped 
Brother. I felt that all our troubles were over then. 
He looked so glad to see us that it seemed a pity to 
tell the disagreeable story that yet remained to be 
told. But once heard, he made all go right in a few 
moments. He got into the carriage with mother, to 
take her to General Bowens, while we got into an 
other to come to the house. I saw no more of the 
guard or officer. 
When we arrived, Sister was too astonished to 
speak. She did not believe we would come when it was 
ordered that all should take the oath on entering. If 
we had only realized it I don't think we would, either. 
</p><p>
In half an hour mother got back. Supported by 
Brother's presence, she had managed to hold up her 
right hand and say "Yes" to the oath which was 
more than any of us had done. 
</p><p>
Brother found an officer at the door who had been 
ordered (before he took mother to the General) to 
arrest her and confine her in the Custom-House. I 
suppose Miriam and I would have shared the imprisonment with her. But Brother has a way of making all these things right; and the man was sent back 
without accomplishing his mission.
