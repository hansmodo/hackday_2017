Two or three days ago a letter bearing the signature of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor</a> and purporting to have been written near Monterey in Mexico, said to have been addressed to him by a friend in New York, was published in the New York Express, and copied into the Herald. I read it in the Herald on yesterday. It is a highly exceptionable letter, assailing as it does the administration, tittering unfounded complaints, and giving publicity to the world of the plans of campaign contemplated by the government, which it had been desired by the government to keep concealed from the enemy until they were consummated. Several persons have spoken to me of the letter, and expressed doubts whether it was genuine or not. I have myself no doubt it is genuine. Considering the letter not only injurious to the public interests, but unjust to the government and its publication highly unmilitary, I sent for the Secretary of War to consult him as to the steps proper to be taken in reference to it. 8 The Secretary of War called.  The Secretary of the Navy was also in my office. I conferred with them fully on the subject. I told the Secretary of War that I thought a letter should be immediately addressed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor</a> enquiring of him whether he was the author of the letter, and that in the meantime a proper article vindicating the government and exposing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor</a> for writing such a letter should be published in the Union. The further consideration of the subject was postponed until tomorrow when the Secretary of War promised to have a suitable article prepared for publication. After the Secretary of War left, a card was brought to me by my porter from General Gaines addressed to the Secretary of War, which I opened and read. It was a letter from General Gaines in which he states that the letter of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">General Taylor</a> which had been published in the newspapers was addressed to him.
