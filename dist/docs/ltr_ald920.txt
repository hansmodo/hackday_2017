WHEN THE history of California shall be written, after time has mellowed the asperities of passing events, the occurrences of the present day will form a singular but strange chapter for the perusal of the statesman and philanthropist, as well as the bookworm. In a country whose people are proverbial for their love of justice and order, where the force of early education and of public example has tended to the observance of the law for the preservation of order and the protection of those rights which belong to free citizens, a state of things exists which borders upon anarchy and threatens to dissolve the social compact of the community; in fact, they have already arrived at the point where strong individual combinations are required to protect life and property from organized bands of desperadoes and heartless men who have made the existing laws an instrument to protect them in crime and high-handed villainy. If this state of things existed in a single town, city, or district, the evil could be corrected by the law itself, but strange to say the whole length and breadth of California is so beset with unprincipled men who set law, order and justice alike at defiance, or make use of the
first, by its technicalities, to subvert the others, that a revolution has become necessary for the protection of rights and at this moment exists in progress throughout the State. On every side is suspicion and distrust of men and authorities. In the cities, as well as in the mountain wilds, it is unsafe for men to go unarmed, and particularly after nightfall; and even in thoroughfares in the largest towns, men are compelled to take the middle of the street, fearful that the first man they meet may be an assassin or robber with a slung shot or pistol. For a long time this was patiently endured. That reverence for existing law which is almost an intuitive feeling with Americans endured there, to await its action, in the hope that its just administration would rid society of its pests and excrescences; but when at length it was seen that the executive itself, if not in actual collusion with crime, pardoned it in its most glaring deformity; that criminals almost universally escaped punishment; that in more than two hundred murders in less than a year but a single legal execution had taken place in the whole State, that the police force was wholly inefficient and sometimes even connected with the commission of crime; that witnesses notoriously perjured themselves to screen their companions in guilt and prove an alibi; that public officers were guilty of peculation and malfeasence; and that for the guilty to be in any event condemned to prison was only affording an easy mode to escape punishment by the insecurity of the jails and the negligence of the jailors; in short, when it was found that under the administration of the law the insecurity of life and property increased instead of diminished, the people became aroused to a sense of their own wrongs and, convinced that there was no other mode of redress, resolved to take the punishment of their aggressors into their own hands, not in opposition to law and order, but to aid the law to do what of itself it could not do, protect the honest part of the community. Not a morning paper appeared in San Francisco that did not herald the perpetration of some robbery or murder the previous night in the city, and it was the same from the mines and different parts in the whole country. In distant counties, goaded on to desperation by repeated acts of violence, the citizens occasionally tumultuously arose and seized the perpetrator, when the constituted authorities would interfere, generally with success, and the criminal almost invariably would escape punishment, till at length it became a byword and reproach when an arrest was made: "He will escape by the law." Up to the present moment, although within the past year at least forty murders have been committed in San Francisco and its immediate vicinity, there has never been a legal execution. In several glaring cases the perpetrators were admitted to merely nominal bail, without the ceremony of incarceration, and were free to continue their assaults
and depredations. Incendiarism was so common that whenthe citizenlaid down at night, his papers and valuables, as well as clothes, were placed in a situation where they could be seized at a moment's warning, and the thought was constant that before daylight should appear he might be a houseless, homeless, ruined man. These things could no longer be endured. Self-preservation rendered it imperative that the first law of nature should be observed, and that unless some united effort was made, society must resolve itself into its primitive elements and brute force be the only defense against aggression and violence. Every ship from the penal colonies of Great Britain only added numbers to the English convicts already here, while the vicious of all nations seemed by instinct to find a rendezvous on our shores, so that California contained hordes of the most accomplished villains who had passed through every grade of crime and were prepared to practice their infernal arts upon the honest and industrious part of the community at the moment of their arrival. Under this state of things an association was organized in San Francisco, composed of its best and most prominent citizens, which soon swelled to a thousand, encouraged and approved by nine tenths of the whole community, who were determined to bring palpable offenders to prompt and speedy justice.

Their first act was to take into custody a thief who was caught in the act of stealing a safe. He was fairly tried before a jury immediately summoned, full proof of guilt was adduced, and without noise or parade he was taken to the plaza about midnight and hung on the piazza of the Adobe
</p><p>
The second day after, a public meeting was called at which thousands of citizens were assembled, who, with but one single dissenting voice (from a lawyer), ratified by vote the acts of the Vigilance Committee (as it was called)
</p><p>
A second meeting took place the following day at which a series of resolutions were introduced, the object of which was to sustain the Committee in purifying the city from the pest of society and censuring the uncertain and tardy administration of justice by the officers of the law. An attempt was made to prevent the passage of these resolutions by a prominent member of the Legislature, backed up by a gang of rowdies and gamblers whom he had rallied around him and who endeavored to interfere with the meeting by violent and unfair means. But the resolutions passed by overwhelming acclamation --A revolution had in fact taken place.
</p><p>
The Vigilance Committee were looked upon as the true purifiers of society, instead of the courts; yet in no case did the former impede the acts of the latter in its administration of justice; its only aim was to punish speedily those who were not secured by the police, without going through with the technicalities of the law, its insecurity and uncertainty; and yet they punished no criminal without a fair trial, without full and positive proof of guilt. The effect of this association was speedily felt. After the execution of Jenkins, numbers of known thieves and burglars left the city, and the Recorder's dock, instead of being filled every morning with criminals, fell off at once to a few cases of drunkenness and disorderly conduct. Determined to effect a thorough renovation, the Committee gave notice to notorious villains to leave the city in five days, and when they refused to obey, they were seized and placed in durance until they could be sent out of the country. Ships from the penal colonies were boarded and the characters of the passengers enquired into, and when they were satisfactorily proven to be convicts, they were not suffered to land, but compelled to return in the same vessel which brought them out. As a matter course there was opposition to the measures of the Vigilance Committee. The constituted authorities, sworn to administer the law (which, even if willing, they had been unable to do), looked upon these acts of the Committee as a breach of the law; the gamblers, thieves, their aiders and abettors, their counselors, who were deriving a revenue in shielding them from justice, weak men who had but little at stake or who could be influenced by the specious reasoning of those directly interested in opposing justice and speedy punishment, formed a party in opposition to the people, for the Vigilance Committee was now the only recognized organ of the people as a body.--Yet in spite of the remonstrances of the Courts, the maligners of those interested, and the doubts of the weak, the Committee steadily persevered in their work, and a feeling of security began to be felt which had not been done for a year and a half before. Even the pulpit came forward to the rescue, and ministers of the gospel were heard from the sacred desk to approve of the acts of the Vigilance Committee, under the peculiar circumstances of the case. The example of San Francisco was speedily followed in all other towns in California, and Vigilance Committees were formed even in the mountains, at nearly every extensive digging, and at this moment, while the constituted authorities are endeavoring to throw impediments in the way of these Committees, thus indirectly encouraging the commission of crime which they cannot punish, these associations are calmly and steadily pursuing their object, and are restoring a degree of confidence in the community which has not been felt for many months.

In addition to other benefits, these associations have had the
effect of instigating the Courts to renewed energy and more prompt execution of law and of justice; and when the time shall arrive that there is sufficient honesty and power in the Courts to faithfully discharge their duties in repressing crime and bring offenders to justice, they will at once resign the right of arrogating to themselves the power of punishing the guilty and leave it with those whose duty it is to protect the honest against fraud and violence.

By the indefatigable energy of the Vigilance Committee a notorious robber was arrested, and the proof was so satisfactory that he was condemned to death. Previous to his execution, Stuart confessed his crimes, and brought to light what had long been suspected, that organized bands of desperadoes existed, that certain lawyers were engaged to protect them with the chicanery of the law, and men of standing were implicated as aiders and abettors in their nefarious practices. Upon the execution of Stuart in open day at the instance of the committee, the authorities expressed themselves as being highly indignant of what they termed an outrage (on what?--their authority?--certainly not on justice). A grand jury was impaneled at the instance of the Judge, who charged them that an awful outrage had been committed in thus hanging a man contrary to law, although the felon had confessed himself guilty of the blackest crimes, and they were directed to bring in a true bill of indictment. The Mayor, too, came out with a proclamation on the subject, but the Committee, disregarding those impotent offerings of spleen, calmly and deliberately pursued the even tenor of their way, determined that justice should overtake the guilty.

A few days ago at Sacramento City, a young man just from the mines, named Wilson, was robbed in open daylight by four desperadoes who decoyed him to an unfrequented part of the city. An alarm was raised, and in half an hour the robbers were in the hands of the Vigilance Committee. The authorities interfered and promised most solemnly that they should be tried immediately without delay, and they were finally given up. It became known the following day that the trial had been postponed four days by the interference of the lawyers, when the people assembled and in a determined manner called upon the executors of the law to redeem their promises, and told them decidedly that unless they proceeded at once with the trial, they would take the prisoners themselves. Seeing that the people were not to be put off with promises, they then went
on with the examination according to law, and a week has been dragged along, during which one has been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, two to be hung, and one remains to be tried. The testimony is positive, as the robbery was witnessed by several individuals; yet, had not the Courts been urged on by the people, weeks would have, in all probability, been consumed; and it is not at all improbable that the villains might have escaped
</p><p>
And such is the present condition of California. With a beautiful climate, abounding in the elements of wealth and of comfort, it is on the verge of anarchy from the imbecility of its rulers; and were it not for the stern determination of the honest part of community to rid the country of its hideous excrescences, it would soon resolve into the primitive condition of society when justice and protection could only be given by the power of the sword and the will of the strong. You will think the picture too highly drawn. You will think I am excited. On the contrary, I am of a dispassionate temperament, and the portrait may be judged by every public account which you receive through the press, as well as at the hands of returning Californians.
