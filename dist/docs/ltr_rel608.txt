<i>[Biographer's note:After this letter, my sisters joined my mother at the
Baths, my father still spending most of his time in Lexington, but
riding over to see them whenever he could.  He was very busy repairing
some of the old buildings of the college and arranging his work for
the next session.  Here is another short note to my mother: ]</i>

                               Lexington, Virginia, August 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1866">1866</a>.

My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse met">Mary</a>:  Mr. Campbell has just informed me that Cousins George
and Eleanor Goldsborough are with you.  Tell them they must not go
till I can get to the Baths.  I think the waters of the latter will
do them as much good as anything they can try, and the sight of them
will do me great benefit.  I find here much to do, but will endeavour
to be with you to-morrow evening or Saturday morning.  Custis has just
come, but finding me occupied with builders, shook hands, got his
dinner, and left for the Institute.  So I do not know where he is from
or where he will go next.  Our neighbours are generally well, and
inquire for you.  Colonel Reid better.  Tell the girls, if I find them
improving, I will bring them something.  Remember me to Cousins George
and Eleanor and all the ladies.  I have about a bushel of letters to
answer and other things to do.

                  Very affectionately,
</p><p>
