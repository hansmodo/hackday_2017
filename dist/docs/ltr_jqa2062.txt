TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 26 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, February 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
The President of the Provisional Representatives of Holland sent me last evening a copy of the new law declaring the importation of flour free during the course of the 
present war. He had told me there would even be a premium added to encourage the trade, but the law simply 
makes the article free. As it may be of some consequence in the United States I herewith inclose a translation of the publication. 
</p><p>
That respecting the circulation of assignats is contained in papers already sent you ; a general compulsive passing of them will be prevented if possible. 
</p><p>
As the majority of the Provinces was represented in the assembly of the States General upon the new system, they have already begun there to annihilate the institutions of 
the former Constitution relating to the generality. They 
began by abolishing the Stadtholdership of the union, and 
by a recognition of the rights of man. They have since 
abolished the council of state and the five admiralties. 
They have also sent a solemn deputation to the Representatives of the French people here, to propose a treaty of friend ship and alliance between the two Republics. 
</p><p>
The answer delivered by the President of the National Convention to the address of the Batavian Deputies has at 
length been published here in the Dutch papers. It leaves the question as to the national independence of this people 
where it was. He calls them Batavian fellow-citizens, and exhorts them to build upon the foundations to be laid by the 
French nation. The Representatives of the French people here have repeatedly promised that the independence of 
this Republic shall be respected, and such is doubtless the 
system of the French executive administration ; but from 
a variety of circumstances it would seem that the legislative sanction is yet wanting to the plan, and that it is a point of some delicacy to obtain it. 
</p><p>
The deputation from the States General consisted of a member from each of the seven Provinces and their new 
Greffier, who addressed the Representatives of the French people, and informed them, 
</p><p>
that their High Mightinesses, together with all the Batavian people, friends of Justice and of Liberty, ardently desire to conclude 
between the two nations as two equal and independent Republics a solid alliance by the means of a Treaty, founded upon equitable 
conditions and equally advantageous to the two states, in order to establish thereby between them the foundation so long desired, 
of the closest fraternity of which the annals of the world have hitherto made mention, a fraternity, of which it is easy to foresee and to 
calculate that the consequences cannot but be extremely advantageous to the two nations, while it cannot fail to advance and effectuate the general peace of Europe. 
</p><p>
If these expressions are compared with the plan of alliance mentioned in my No. n, perhaps the outlines of the 
future alliance as intended to be proposed from hence may be inferred. The deputation was doubtless very courteously 
received, as was that from the Provincial Assembly of Holland, sent two days before for the same purpose ; but what answer was given them does not yet appear. 
</p><p>
Under the present circumstances it is from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> that 
you will probably receive the most accurate and earliest 
information of the political system which is to govern this 
country. The determination of annexing the Austrian 
Netherlands and Belgium to the French Republic has been 
openly professed in a speech, which was received with the 
most distinguished marks of applause. "The Ocean and 
the Rhine," said the orator, "great rivers, the mountains 
and the sea must be our future boundaries ; beyond them we 
are the friends of every people" This line necessarily 
comprehends several important places hitherto within 
the dominion of the United Provinces, and which may be 
expected to be ceded by the treaty, at the same time when 
the independence of the remainder will be formally acknowl 
edged. 
</p><p>
The French troops are in possession of the province of Zeeland, and the Revolution has been effected at Middelburg the capital. The details of this event are contained in the papers inclosed. 
</p><p>
The system of moderation towards the members and partizans of the former governments, which has been strongly recommended by the French Representatives from 
the moment of their arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, has hitherto 
been pursued with very few exceptions. At Utrecht, it is 
said the members of the ancient regency and several other 
persons have been put under arrest. The representatives 
of the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> have been instigated to imitate 
the example. They have not only resisted the impulse of 
private revenge, but have published an address to their 
fellow-citizens, detailing the motives of their conduct in 
this respect, and declaring the principles upon which their 
determination is founded to persist in their lenient treatment of the defeated party. There is indeed every reason 
to hope that this policy will not be abandoned so long as the Stadtholderian partizans remain quiet, and give no new occasion for severity. 
</p><p>
February 2ist. The answer of the French representatives to the deputations from the States General and the Provincial Assembly of Holland are now published. This 
country it seems is still to be at war. 
</p><p>
A further proof of this appears in the resolution taken by the States General to notify their acknowledgment of the rights of man, abolition of the Stadtholdership, etc., 
to all their Ministers in foreign countries, together with the assurance that the people wish no other than a continuance of peace, except with respect to the courts of Vienna, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=berlin" rel="city">Berlin</a>. 
</p><p>
It appears probable that as soon as the revolution is 
effected, and the provisional administration established 
through the seven Provinces, a National Convention will be 
proposed for the formation of a Constitution. The present 
prevailing sentiment leads to the expectation that the 
separate sovereignties will be dissolved, and that of the Batavian people alone remain. It is to be observed that the ideas upon the subject of government in general of that 
which may be most suitable to the character and circumstances of this people are far from being settled. They do 
not even seem prepared for the elementary principles of universal suffrage. They have so long been habituated to 
exclusions upon political commercial and religious considerations, that it is questionable whether they will open the 
door of popular prerogatives so widely, as their general acknowledgment of the rights of man promises. In the elections for the provisional government the people have 
had no agency. The persons chosen are taken indiscriminately from all the Christian sects. But this political 
liberality did not extend to the appointment of any Jews, 
although they are very numerous in the Republic, and at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> constitute perhaps a fifth part of the population. 
</p><p>
It is said that a considerable part of the French army in these provinces is to march as soon as possible upon an 
expedition against Hanover. They appear indeed desirous to withdraw all their troops from a country where at present they have no occasion to act, and where they will be 
in danger of contracting habits unfriendly to their discipline. 
</p><p>
But if they quit this country, the aspect of internal affairs may perhaps be in some measure affected by their absence. They are certainly at present the strongest bond 
of union here, and as long as they remain the party opposed 
to the new order of things will be quiet and silent; the case 
will not be the same after their departure. 
</p><p>
The fiscal of the Admiralty at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> and the Vice 
Admiral van Kinsbergen have been arrested. Several ships 
belonging to the East India Company, very richly laden, were in the ports of England at the time when the French 
arrived here. They are now detained by an embargo. The circumstance of their being in England is suspected to be not accidental. 
</p><p>
Having had occasion twice to write to the President of the Provisional Assembly of Holland, in obedience to the 
article of my instructions which occasioned my correspondence with Mr. Lelyveld, a copy of which I had the honor 
of sending you some time since, I wrote in our own language. Mr. Paulus noticed the circumstance, and I find it is mentioned in the journals of the Assembly that the application 
I had made was in writing, "though in the English language." It has to them the appearance of singularity, as all their other diplomatic correspondence is carried on in French, 
and it subjects them to some inconvenience because very few of them can read our language. I have never used it 
with any one of them without their mentioning it after wards, but as I have not felt myself authorised to tell them 
it was in consequence of a positive instruction, I have never given them any reason for the practice. It has been one 
principal cause which has hitherto prevented me from writing on the subject of the consular question, as well as 
upon that of the heavier duties imposed upon our navigation than upon that of the European nations. 
</p><p>
I have lately received a letter from General Eustace at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. He assures me that he delivered to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague">Mr. Monroe</a> the letter which I had intrusted to him for you, so that I 
presume you will receive it in due time. The General in 
his letter insinuates that the motives of his return to France 
originated in his arrest while he was here. It is probable 
that he was employed by the Patriots of this country to 
concert measures between those at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> and those in 
Holland, as well perhaps as to obtain favorable terms from 
their friendly conquerors. I am etc.
