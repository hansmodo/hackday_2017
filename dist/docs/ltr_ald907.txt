THE RAINY season had commenced, and if non gustibus disputandum was ever exemplified, it was in the month of November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>, in California. It was during one of these not gentle floods that two friends of mine were climbing over the steep mountains through which the South Fork of Feather River forces its way in its rapid course to the parent stream, and although not like Don Quixote, seeking adventures, adventures came to them which might have honored the Flower of Chivalry himself. They had started on a prospecting tour for gold, and in a region then imperfectly known where, even in good weather, the passage of the hills and ravines was laborious, but now so slippery and the stream so swollen by the floods, it was almost impossible to get along. Supplies, too, on the route were entirely out of the question, and in addition to a pan, pick and shovel, they were compelled to bear upon their shoulders a week's rations, cooking utensils, firearms and ammunition for protection against the savages, and their blankets, which soon being saturated with water, doubled their weight. They had got only about a couple of miles from Bidwell Bar, the last station on the river, when the rain increased so much that they were fain to encamp in a deep gorge, hoping that the morning sun would beam more auspiciously upon them--.

"By heaven, Captain Freeland, this is too bad; we can't get along at this rate; let us lay over until tomorrow." "I believe you are right, Colonel Grant," replied Freeland, "this is worse than the hills of Yucatan, for although they were steep and slippery enough, it did not rain like this when we followed the Indians among them." "Well, old soldier," responded Grant, "where shall we encamp? The chance for that, even, is somewhat precarious." "There is a good spot on the hillside under that tree," said Freeland. "What! across that mad stream? How can we cross?" "O, we can do it," said Freeland, and to show that it could be done, he attempted to jump from the root of a tree upon a rock near the opposite bank, and he did land, nearly waist deep at the foot of the rock in the creek. "Ha! ha! ha!" roared Grant, "you are not a Rhodian Colossus, Freeland. How do you find the diggings?" "Not dry, anyhow," responded Freeland, crawling out on his hands and knees; "now try it yourself, my fine fellow."
</p><p>
But Grant had a flea in his ear and concluded to prospect a little higher up for dry diggings, at least in crossing. By good luck he found a pole that had fallen across the stream, and although a rather precarious crossing, he ascertained that it would bear his weight, and he commenced the transit. About midway, his feet slipped, and imitating an equestrian, he found himself sitting astride his wooden horse with his legs dangling in the water over his boot tops.
</p><p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" echoed Freeland, maliciously, "what are you doing there, Grant?" "Bobbing for whales," grinned Grant, "and I've caught a gudgeon. I never found out the true value of long boots before; when filled with water, they are equal to a balance pole in riding a wooden horse across a crazy brook." But at length they succeeded in getting safe over and, with much difficulty, kindled a fire by which, although they could not dry themselves, they could cook their salt pork and get warm. Night now came upon them, and spreading their blankets on the wet ground, they laid down to--be rained on--sleep being quite another affair. In a short time Grant nudged his companion.
</p><p>
"Freeland, are you asleep?" "Asleep! what the d--l do you mean by that, Grant?" "O, nothing, only to enquire into the nature of your dreams--as for myself, I've had a vision. I thought as we lay here, under the broad canopy of heaven, that it rained."--"Rained," interrupted Freeland; "why, man, you are in a trance." "Trance or not, I am laying in water at least six inches deep, and it's my impression that we had better move our boots to a little higher ground." "Nonsense, Grant, your boots are so water-soaked that you can't move 'em. Lay still; your body will warm the water, and if we move we shall catch cold."
</p><p>
And they did lay still till daylight, and then they arose as wet as if they had been laying in the creek. From stress of weather they
were compelled to stay in these very comfortable quaters five days, and by that time they only had two days' rations left.

Anyone who knows California men knows that they keep digging as long as there is a shot left in the locker, and when the storm somewhat abated they again started. Two days of intense labor brought them to Stony Point, and to the end of their provisions, except a small piece of salt fat pork. A man had just got in before them with fifty pounds of flour, and they thought, of course, there was no danger of starving; but on application to the wealthy possessor of so much flour, they learned that only ten pounds belonged to him, and the rest was promised to other individuals--so that, although his disposition was good enough, he was morally unable to let them have a mouthful. "Um! um!" groaned Grant, with his hand on his stomach, which was making imperious demands for tribute, "here's a go, Freeland. What shift can you make in this dilemma? Somehow I am convinced this is a dilemma, for I feel the horns grating under my sternum." "Humph!" said Freeland, "I have it--no danger of starving yet; there's a bit of pork left." "Yes." "Well, did you ever eat pork soup?" "No, how does it go?" "O, capital. Oysters should not be mentioned the same day," and Freeland installed himself as cook. Filling their camp kettle with water, the pork was put in, and after boiling a couple of hours, the cook called all hands from labor (of waiting) to refreshment. Freeland helped himself bountifully and worked away like a hero upon it. Grant, on viewing the premises, saw nothing but a little stingy grease on top of the water, and one taste was enough. "What's this, Freeland?" "Why, pork soup, to be sure, and capital too. Never ate better." Slup! slup! and he guzzled it down as if it was palatable." "Why, Grant, you don't eat; ain't you fond of it?" "Fond of it?--fond of the d--l; I would as soon eat tartar emetic soup. Augh! augh! I believe in my soul I shall vomit, hungry as I am." And although it had been fast day with them, he preferred living on Faith and Hope until he could either reach the settlements or, at least, until the rebellion of his stomach was subdued. Another night of suffering, and another day and a half of hard walking, brought them back to Mr. Dawly's, where the inner man was supplied with what their physical condition required. This is no fancy sketch, and I hope you will get the story from Colonel Grant's own mouth; for but a meagre account can be given on paper of what severe trials men often encounter when prospecting in the mountains. It was on Colonel Grant's return from this memorable excursion that I first made his acquaintance, which, I trust, may continue forever.

During the emigration last year, a family from Indiana had all their cattle stolen by the Indians in the night, on the Humboldt or Mary's River, a short time after I passed that point. There they were, without the means of locomotion, a family composed of several small children besides the parents, in the wilderness, many hundred miles from the settlements, and their condition was indeed deplorable. Their case excited the compassion of some of the trains, and a company of twenty-five men, under the command of Captain King, volunteered to go in pursuit and recover the cattle, if possible. After proceeding several miles over the mountains, the company by some means got divided in passing up a gorge, and Captain King found himself with three others, named Elliott, Moore and King, traveling by themselves. Turning a sharp point of rocks, they suddenly came upon four Indians who, instead of fleeing, resolutely attacked the captain and his little party. Each man selected his antagonist, and for a while victory was doubtful. Each American drew up his rifle, but the cap on Captain King's piece exploded without discharging it. The Indians discharged their stone-pointed arrows with great rapidity, and Moore was wounded in his head. Captain King jumped aside as his Indian drew his bow, and the arrow missed him. He immediately closed with him, seizing the bow with one hand and grasping the Indian's hand with the other, while the savage caught hold of the Captain's gun. Both were powerful men and struggled until they were out of breath to obtain possession of each other's weapon and release themselves. Getting breath a little, the Captain kicked the gun out of the Indian's hand and sprang to seize it. His knife and pistol had slipped behind him in the belt, so that he could not use them at the moment, and while he was putting his hand into his vest pocket to get a cap, the Indian let fly an arrow which wounded him in the wrist. By this time he had placed the cap upon the lock, and before the Indian could discharge another arrow, the deadly messenger of death had done its duty. Elliott had also killed his man, but Moore was still fighting. As each arrow was discharged he bent his head and received each one on his skull. He still continued fighting, although he thought himself mortally wounded, calling on the others for aid. His shot had taken effect on the Indian, who still continued to fight with the utmost desperation, until Elliott had dispatched his adversary and ran up to assist Moore. Elliott fired his pistol, when the Indian, finding the odds against him, now for the first time began to think of retreating, although desperately wounded. As he turned to run, Elliott drew his knife and stabbed him, but he still made off, when the former made a pass and cut his neck badly. Under the impression, probably, that now he could not escape, he turned upon Elliott with his knife, but a second thrust cut open his belly, his bowels protruded, and he sank upon the ground, resting upon one arm and striking wildly with his knife. Moore, recovering a little, now ran up, and putting his pistol
to the Indian's head, blew out his brains and ended this terrible encounter by the death of his foe, and the white men stood victorious upon this desperate battlefield. Moore eventually recovered, but the cattle were lost entirely, and the unfortunate emigrant was assisted to reach the Valley of the Sacramento by the other trains.
