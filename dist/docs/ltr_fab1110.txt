I arrived all safe on Saturday at this place. It has grown much larger since I have been up the river. There is a perfect forest of shipping in the harbor. All the canvass houses have disappeared and handsome frame and brick buildings have taken their places. Several new saloons have been opened equal to the Broadway saloons and eating houses. A circus and theatre have been opened and the streets are as much blocked up with carts and people as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>.

The weather is fine; much warmer than when we were here in August. People look much more dressed here than up the river: more cityfied. There is more society. Ladies are quite plentiful as you may judge from the fact that there are two large handsome ballrooms in full blast. The city contains now over 20,000 people. It is bound to be a large city. The trade from China is coming in here fast and from all over the Pacific.

Tell Father I had to finish his letter in a great hurry to get it into the bags that I sent the dust in to Uncle R.B.B. I had to get down to the office before twelve o'clock
with my bills of lading. There is an immense quantity of gold going in this steamer. Her yawl boat was loaded with boxes. I heard in Messrs. Symmons and Hutchinson's office that it would come up to $2,000,000. Don't stare! This country raises gold and they have not begun to dig it up yet. If you had seen the heavy valises that came down the river when I came you would think there was some here, if not more. I know of three men who are going 'home' with $150,000. There are some rich men here. Samuel Brannan, one of the proprietors of Sac. City and who owns the city hotel there, has an income from his rents alone of $160,000 a year, besides a store here and at the place. He is a young man who came out here three years ago. When mine amount to that I shall come home. I have sent you a small specimen of the native gold, also some to Father and Mother. You can have it manufactured into some article of jewelry (take it to some one who will not cheat you) and wear it in remembrance of the gold fever...that has brought me and so many thousands from home. Those are small pieces. I have seen one lump that weighed a pound and two ounces but the large ones are all bought up to send home and are getting scarce. Most of the gold is like the dust that I sent Father.

Politics begin to be agitated. A mass meeting was held the other evening in the square and a governor and a delegate to congress were nominated and will be elected soon. Next congress this will be made a state.

Captain Cole thinks of sending for his wife if he does not go home this winter after her.
