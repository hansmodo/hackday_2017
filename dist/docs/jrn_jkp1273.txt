I had a dinner party today. Between thirty and forty persons, members of the two houses of Congress and several ladies of their families, dined with me. Among others the Vice-President, his wife and two daughters, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives were of the party. Mr. Calhoun, who was also of the party, remained at my request after dinner until the company had dispersed, when we retired from the parlour to my office. I resumed the conversation which I had with him a few days ago, about the proper manner of conducting the Mexican War. I was particularly desirous to have his concurrence in the proposition to create a Lieutenant-General to command the army during the Mexican War. I found he still had objections to it, which I fear he will not yield. He expressed himself in favour of the policy of establishing a cordon of military posts and holding a sufficient  territory to indemnify ourselves, instead of making the crushing movement with a great army upon the City of Mexico. He thought there were almost insuperable difficulties to the latter policy, and that if pursued the war might be of indefinite duration. My conversation with him was of a friendly and pleasant character.
