Dear Brother,<br>
	During the last week I have attended the U.S. War Exposition at Grant park, (which is the lake front.) once in the afternoon and once in the evening. It is a wonderful show and there has not been such crowds in Chicago since the Worlds Fair. It lasted from Sept. 2nd to 15th  Today is the closing day and I suppose there will be considerable over 200,000 people there. We were down last night and it was an awful jam. 211,265 people attended yesterday.
	In Los Angeles they had 195,000 in the eleven days and 211,265 in one day here. How is that? 2 million will be the number during the show here. They had a regular ‘no mans land’ and a battle twice a day with the trenches and everything as near a battle field as possible. With Y.M.C.A. huts, dressing huts, wire fences (mines), charges, lots of shooting, bombs, two red cross dogs, carrier pigeons, and the greatest thing was the Tank Britannia which came lumbering across a big pile of wood and over the trenches when the U.S. boys were charging.
	(unintelligible) Aeroplanes flying over head doing all kinds of stunts. The exhibit consisted of 93 American War Trophies, U.S. Army exhibit, 70 Belgian exhibits, 196 British Govt. exhibits of War Relics, Trophies and Curios. 58 British (unintelligible) Collection of German Contraband found in mail (very interestng). British Govt. Collection of Medals representing ten centuries of warfare, Canadian exhibit of 400 pieces also 200 pictures, 150 French exhibits, 142 Royal Italian exhibits. Besides all this there were exhibits of the activities of athletics, camp music, educational work, entertainment, social hygiene, law enforcement, Y.M.C.A., K of C, Jewish Welfare Board, Library Service, Hostess Houses, N.W.C.A, and War Camp Community Service, Red Cross and lots of other things. It certainly was a big affair. The U.S. Govt. expected it would cost considerable besides the money taken in at the gates but they now expect to have over $150,000 clear money. There were three or four Aeroplanes (captured) and lots of guns. Camp meals meals were served at 50 cents and there were lines nearly a block long trying to get a meal like served the boys. I have a friend here who leaves in a few days as an Athletic director for the Y.M.C.A. Two of the boys that I know very well were slightly wounded and in a hospital in France. Before I forget I want you to write when you think you will get into the fight. The last two days we have been getting the reports of the fine work done by our boys at St. Mihiel drive. Big headlines of 150 Sq Miles in 27 hours. All men from 18 to 45 had to register last week so we will have some Army over there in due time. I am getting the fever myself.
	Eugene V. Debs the serialist was given a sentence of ten years in the pen. this week for his talks. I think I told you of the 100 I.W.W.’s that were given from five to 20 years and big fines. Last week some one threw a bomb in the Federal Building here which killed a few and wounded quite a number besides some damage to the building and a lot of damage to plate glass near the building and in it. The I.W.W.’s are blamed for it  but no one has been found yet.
	Last week Bess and I drove down to La (unintelligible) for over Sunday 146 miles and a fine trip. It seems funny not to see any autos on Sunday since the Govt. stopped them to save gas. The Ford and the Packard Co’s of Detroit are not making any more auto’s but are 100% war work for the Govt. Well close for the present. If there are any of the boys that this letter would interest - you can read it to them. Be sure and let me know when you expect to get into the fight. Let me know if you get this letter.<br>
Best Wishes,<br>
