instant after reading, nor the printed articles. I knew these falsehoods would be circulated when 
the estate was divided. What has been the cause of the delay about the circulars ? I fear, 
between ourselves, we have reason to distrust those men, - . Whatever is raised by the 
colored people, I solemnly give my word, at my death it shall all, every cent, be returned to 
them. And out of the sum, if it is $50,000, you shall have $5,000 at my death ; and I cannot live long, suffering as I am now doing. If 
$25,000 is raised by your people, you shall have the sum at my death ; and in either event, the 
$25,000 raised, or $50,000, I will give you $300 a year, and the promised sum at my death. It 
will make your life easier. I have more faith in F. D.'s and G.'s efforts, than in B. & K., I assure 
you. This division has been trumped up just now through spite. * * I have written to 
Judge Davis for an exact statement, which I will send to you when received. Write if any thing is doing. *
