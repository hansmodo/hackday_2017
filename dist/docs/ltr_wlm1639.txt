WAR DEPARTMENT, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, January 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
<p></p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague met">SIR</a>: I deem it proper to send to you a letter (taken from a newspaper) which first 
appeared in the "New York Morning Express" and has since, as a matter of course, 
been transferred to many other journals. I learn from General Gaines that the letter is 
genuine. This information, I am assured, he had previously given to others. As the 
letter was not marked " confidential," he adjudged that circumstances existed which 
justified the publication of some part of it, though he expresses an opinion that it was 
not written with such a view. 
<p></p>
It will, in a short time, be in possession of our enemy ; and coming, as it does, from 
the General to whom the conduct of the war, on our part, was confided, it will convey 
most valuable information to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=als" rel="adversary">the Mexican Commander</a>, not only in relation to our present 
line of operations, but as to the new one, which alone, in your opinion, can be taken with 
a prospect of success, if an attempt is to be made on the city of Mexico. 
<p></p>
The disclosure of your views, as to the future operations of our forces, accompanied, 
as it is, with your opinion, that the fruits of the war, if completely successful, will be 
of little worth to us, will, it is greatly to be feared, not only embarrass our subsequent 
movements, but disincline the enemy to enter into negotiations for peace. With particular reference to these effects, the publication is most deeply to be regretted. 
<p></p>
The 650th paragraph of the General Regulations of the Army, published March 1, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>, declares that "Private letters or reports, relative to military marches and operations are frequently mischievous in design, and always disgraceful to the army. They 
are therefore strictly forbidden, and any officer found guilty of making such report for publication, without special permission, or of placing the writing beyond his control, so that it 
finds its way to the press, within one month after the termination of the campaign to 
which it relates, shall be dismissed from the service." 
<p></p>
This paragraph was not included in the compilation of the General Regulations, published in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1841">1841</a>, but is deemed peculiarly applicable to a state of war, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</> has 
directed it to be republished, and the observance of it strictly enjoined upon all officers. 
<p></p>
I have the honor to be, 
<p></p>
very respectfully, 
<p></p>
your obedient servant, 
<p></p>
