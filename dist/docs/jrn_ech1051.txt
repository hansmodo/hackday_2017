A short time ago, Jim Hill, a man with a scar on his neck, went into a store at Camp Seco
in the night and held pistols over the heads of the proprietors, while others of his gang stole the iron safe. Last night he was in Sonora. He went into a Spanish house of ill-fame, where Guadalupe, the keeper, is no doubt an accomplice. Hill took a pistol from a man, a stranger to him, struck him with it and then shot at him. The man ran out of the house, frightened, and gave the alarm, not knowing who had robbed and shot him. Hill then hid under a bed where he was found by the sheriff.

This morning a party of about a dozen of our most respectable citizens went to the jail and took Hill away to stand his trial at Camp Seco. His identity was proved and a fair and impartial trial was given before a jury of twelve men who rendered a verdict of guilty unanimously. It was then voted to hang the prisoner and a committee of five was appointed to confer with him to endeavor to obtain disclosures in reference to others and their whereabouts. In this they were successful. He confessed his guilt and told of others connected with him in horse stealing and other crimes. He is willing to die for what he has done and wishes those who led him into crime to be hung along with him. Parties were dispatched to Sonora, Melones and other places to catch different ones that were named, all of whom had been suspected. The doomed man is about 23 years old.
