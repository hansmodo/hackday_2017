My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I sincerely congratulate you on the favorable turn of affairs announced in your last, and I hope you will be enabled to maintain that superiority, which you seem to be gaining over Lord Cornwallis. We have had a 
variety of reports of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>'s further successes in South Carolina. By some we are told, that both <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> and Ninety-Six have fallen, but in a letter, 
which I have just received from Monsieur Marbois, he says that <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> has been taken, and the siege of Ninety-Six raised. <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> formed a junction with me at the camp, about twelve miles from 
Kingsbridge, a few days ago. We are waiting for reinforcements to the Continental line, and for militia, and are in the mean time establishing our communication at Dobbs's Ferry. 
</p><p>
I shall shortly have occasion to communicate matters of very great importance to you, so much so, that I 
shall send a confidential officer on purpose. You will in the mean time endeavour to draw together as respectable a body of Continental troops as you possibly can, and take every measure to augment your cavalry. 
Should the enemy confine themselves to the lower country, you will no doubt pay attention to the formation of magazines above. These will be in every case 
essential, whether the war continues in Virginia, or 
whether it shall still be carried on in South Carolina. 
Should <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> come into Virginia in person, 
you will be good enough to communicate the foregoing to him. 
</p><p>
In the present situation of affairs, it is of the utmost 
importance that a communication by a chain of expresses should be opened between this army and that in 
Virginia. They are already established from hence to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and if there is none from you to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, you will be pleased to take measures for having it formed. You will also endeavour to establish 
such a communication with the coast, as to be able to 
know whether any troops are detached by sea from 
Lord Cornwallis's army ; for it is more than probable, 
that, if he finds himself baffled in attempting to overrun Virginia, he will take a strong post at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, 
or <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, and reinforce <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or South 
Carolina. Should any detachment be made, you will 
transmit to me the earliest intelligence. What you say 
in confidence of the conduct of a certain officer shall 
be kept a profound secret, and I will contrive means 
of removing him from the quarter where he is so unpopular. 
</p><p>
The Rhode Island regiment is so thinly officered, 
that Colonel Olney wishes one of the subalterns of the 
light company may be suffered to return, when Captain Olney joins. You will act in this as circumstances 
may permit. You have the compliments and good 
wishes of all your friends in the French army. Those 
of the American are not behindhand with them. With 
the warmest affection and esteem, I am, &c. 
</p>
