HACIENDO, SAN ANTONIO, 
May 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
About ten this morning I received an order to march 
as an escort to the siege train under Hayner to this 
place and then to proceed to Tipi Gualco to join the 
light battalion. My company marched out of the 
castle about half-past one, took the great road to 
Mexico, and before sunset reached here, eight miles 
from Perote, where there is a large garrison under 
Major Wright. This hacienda is worthy of a description. The front of it is immediately on the road - 
the main entrance being through the building and 
opening upon an enclosure of at least one hundred and 
fifty yards on a side, surrounded by a high stone wall 
with flanking towers on the diagonal corners. On 
two sides of it are extensive sheds, and in the centre 
a large and very deep well from which the water is 
drawn by horse or mule power. The animal is har 
nessed to a sweep which turns a windlass like an old-fashioned cider mill. He moves round in one direction 
until the bucket reaches the top, when he is turned 
and travels the opposite way until the other bucket 
comes up. This is kept going night and day, the water 
being turned into troughs from which it is used for 
every purpose, agricultural and domestic. There are 
now in the storehouses here more than ten thousand 
bushels of corn and barley which have been purchased 
by our quarter-master. About the exterior are huge 
stacks of straw and corn stalks for fodder, no hay being 
ever made in this country. This estate, which belongs 
to a young man, is twelve miles square and has on it 
large herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, droves of mules, 
horses, and swine, and some hundreds of slaves 
they are called peons who are under the worst kind 
of bondage, belonging to their masters until they get 
out of debt to him, which he takes care they never 
shall do. These poor creatures under an overseer are 
turned out to work before daylight. They are as 
sembled in a sort of military array before a great cross 
erected near the main entrance of the hacienda, where 
they all join in a matin song. When they return from 
work in the evening a similar ceremony takes place, - 
in the presence of the overseer, mounted on his horse, 
they sing their hymn to the Virgin. The song concluded they retire to their huts to gather strength, 
amidst their dirt, for another day s servitude.

We hear that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> says that in all probability our communication with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> will be cut 
off from six to nine months. A sweet prospect not to 
hear from you for nine months! I don t believe the 
story it must be all gammon ! I shall continue to 
write as hitherto. We march in the morning at sun 
rise. . . .

May 4, Tipi Gualco (old Indian meaning, lost). We 
left San Antonio early this morning. A heavy mist 
lay upon the plain making it quite dark and wetting 
us almost as completely as a drenching rain. I felt 
wretchedly. Last night after writing in a room full of 
officers who were sleeping around me, I put out my 
light and lay down, but soon felt an attack of gastritis 
coming on. I endeavored to lie still not being willing 
to disturb any one, in the hope it would soon pass off. 
It, however, became unendurable and I was compelled to arouse my man Barney who slept in the 
anteroom and send for the doctor. He soon relieved 
me, but as usual I am paying for it today. Mem. - 
Barney is a character. For many years he was in the 
service of W. R. Johnson, the " Napoleon of the Turf," 
and rode Peytona on all her famous races. He is an 
acute little jockey, and a most excellent servant. He 
has become much attached to me and, I believe, serves 
me from pure love. 
</p><p>
About eight o clock the mist suddenly rolled away 
over the tops of the high mountains about us, showing 
that we were on an arid plain herbless and desolate. 
Our whole route was the same until at eleven o clock 
we reached this town situated at the base of a high 
pumice stone mountain of the same name. Every 
thing here showed decay and misrule. I reported to 
Colonel Garland and to Lieutenant- Colonel Smith, 
and after an hour or two succeeded in obtaining shelter 
for my company and myself in a dirty, ruined place 
nearly a mile from the rest of the brigade. By some 
labor we have made it comfortable and a cup of coffee 
has made me feel quite well. We are near the house 
of the curate, and this afternoon, with Rossell and 
Farrelly, I visited him. 
</p><p>
He was nearly frightened to death when we entered 
his domicile or rather yard at the gate of which 
he was standing, and taking off his high-crowned 
sombrero, he bowed nearly to the earth. We sat down 
in his humble dwelling and soon succeeded in restoring 
his confidence, especially after Farrelly assured him 
he was a Catholic. We went through the church which 
is very large, and was once a fine building but is now 
much dilapidated. The padre accompanied us to our 
quarters, and after sipping a glass of wine with us out 
of a tin pint cup left us apparently quite our friend. 
In this high desert land fleas and ticks are too wise to 
live, so I hope to pass a quiet night. Buenos noches.

May 5. Nothing new today either from the front 
or rear save a rumor, which I think entirely unfounded, 
that Trowbridge and his clerk have been murdered 
near Santa Fe. I do not believe that he has yet arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>. I beg you to continue to write 
to me as hitherto, for the reinforcements which must 
continue to arrive will escort the mails from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>, 
even should we be unable to send ours to that point. 
Be under no apprehensions on my account if you do 
not hear from me. My health is good and I shall take 
good care to keep it so. We are in a healthy region 
and I do not believe we shall have another general 
action. 
</p><p>
My opinion of volunteers and the whole volunteer 
system is not changed in the least. They are expensive, unruly, and not to be relied upon in action. Their 
conduct towards the poor inhabitants has been horrible, and their coming is dreaded like death in every 
village in Mexico, while the regulars are met by the 
people almost as friends. A portion of them (the 
volunteers) have fled in every action in which they 
have been engaged and they can never succeed unless 
supported by the line. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, Buena Vista, 
and Cerro Gordo portions of them ran. General 
Taylor says in a letter that at Buena Vista, had they 
not been turned back by the enemy who had got to 
his rear, many more than did would have entirely 
fled the battle field. Pillow's Brigade of volunteers 
were defeated at Cerro Gordo, and he requested the 
General to send him a few regulars, if only one company, to support and set an example to his men. The 
first instance is yet to occur in this war in which a 
regular has abandoned his post or been defeated. 
Portions of the volunteers have fought most gallantly, 
but when they will fight, and when they won t, can 
only be determined by experiment. I am aware that 
these opinions would be considered almost treasonable 
in the United States, but here they are the sentiments 
of all the regulars and of a large number of the volunteer officers in the field.

May 6, Tepeyahualco (correct spelling, pronounced 
Ta-pa-dh-wolko). This was once a fine little town, 
most of it is now in ruins. It is between fifty and sixty 
miles from Puebla which is said to be the third city in 
Mexico. There are now here Duncan s light battery, 
the light battalion under Colonel C. F. Smith, to 
which I am acting major; the Second Artillery commanded by Captain McKenzie, the Third Artillery 
by Colonel Belton, and the Fourth Infantry under 
Colonel Graham. These battalions with five companies of the Fifth, which are still at Perote, consti 
tute a brigade under Colonel Garland. Our men have 
suffered terribly here with ague and fever and bilious 
intermittents. The sickness arises from their great 
exposure in the tierra caliente near the coast, their 
bivouacking in the heavy dews and rains, and the 
excessive fatigue of their long march. The cases are 
generally light, and in this cool, healthy climate they 
will soon recover. Dr. Satterlee is my attending 
physician. 
</p><p>
Some Mexican gentlemen came in this morning 
from Puebla. One of them, a very intelligent man, 
educated in Hartford, Connecticut, represents the 
country as in a most deplorable condition, the Government as utterly disorganized by the battle of Cerro 
Gordo, which he pronounces the most serious blow 
the Republic has ever received. The Government, he 
says, is not capable of carrying on the war or of making 
a peace. The roads are filled with bands of robbers 
under the name of guerillas, who are as ready to 
plunder and murder the Mexicans as they are to 
attack us. The city of Puebla has a deputation prepared to meet us before we reach its gates to escort 
us within its walls, and an officer ready to turn over 
the public property. From the best information there 
is not at this time more than four thousand Infantry 
of the enemy under arms in all this portion of Mexico. 
There are besides some three thousand cavalry under 
General Canalizo who escaped from the battle of 
Cerro Gordo, but they are of no account, and we 
neither know nor care where they are. 
</p><p>
There is no middle class in this country. The upper 
" ten hundred " not " ten thousand " possess all the 
wealth and are continually quarreling about the control of affairs and creating constant revolutions. The 
millions are steeped in ignorance, vice, and poverty, 
abject to the priests and trampled to the dust by the 
wealthy. . . . 
</p><p>
May 7. There is a probability of our remaining 
here some days. Some troops were sent this morning 
to the village of San Juan, seven miles distant, to 
secure certain supplies which were intercepted by a 
petty robber chief. They returned this evening and 
reported that the chief had fled, but they found San 
Juan a fine, neat town containing three churches and 
from three to four thousand inhabitants. It lies in a 
rich, cultivated valley about twenty miles in extent. 
So far we have been able to secure at high prices an 
abundance of grain, flour, beef, mutton, fresh pork, 
some coffee, sugar and salt, with common tallow 
candles, so that the army can be tolerably well provisioned without transporting supplies from the seaboard during the hot season. I wish we could move 
forward to Puebla where the sick would be more comfortable. I have now forty-five men of my company 
sick, twenty-three of them are present, and the remaining twenty-two have been left at various places 
on the route. . . . 
</p><p>
May 8. This is the anniversary of the battle of 
Palo Alto, my first fight, the first of the war, and perhaps the most important in its consequences. Little 
did we think, who were engaged in that contest, that 
in one year we would be in the heart of Mexico, and 
that a salute in honor of that victory would peal from 
the walls of San Juan D Ulloa. Where shall we be a 
year hence? Quien sabe? perhaps in California, 
perhaps at home, which may God grant. 
</p><p>
Seven regiments of volunteers are going home, their 
time having expired. This will reduce our force so 
much that it is doubtful whether <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> will 
think it prudent to advance beyond Puebla. . . . 
</p><p>
May 9. This is the anniversary of the battle of 
Resaca. How differently I feel now with regard to 
the war from what I did then! Then vague visions of 
glory and a speedy peace floated through my brain. 
Now I have learned in common with many other poor 
fellows that it is not he who patiently does his duty, 
or who in the hour of danger is in the front of the battle, 
who gains the laurel or the more vulgar reward of 
government patronage. It is too frequently the 
sycophant who flatters the foibles of his commanding 
officer, he who has political family influence, or whom 
some accident makes conspicuous, who reaps all the 
benefits of the exposure and labors of others. The 
long list of brevets, most outrageously unjust as they 
are, many of them double, is a register of evidence to 
the facts that success is a lottery and that government 
rewards are by no means dependent on merit. How 
tired and sick I am of a war to which I can see no 
probable termination ! How readily would I exchange 
my profession for any honest, mechanical employment, 
were it possible to do so! How instantly would I 
resign if I saw any certainty of supporting my family 
in tolerable comfort or even decency in civil life! 
Why do I grumble or let you know how miserable I 
am ? Think not I am always so. It is not often that 
I suffer my mind to dwell on these matters, or yield 
to any despondency. General Worth (" Young 
Cortes") has arrived with the remainder of the Second 
Brigade. . . . General Worth's division is to march 
at once to Puebla. . . . General Worth informs me 
that Major Kirby has gone back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> by order 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>, who wants his shrewd counsel and 
can find no other man capable of settling the confused 
accounts of the "Mohawks" who are tired of the war 
and are going home to boast of their deeds of arms. . . . 
Rossell is in fine health. He is an excellent officer and 
ought to have been brevetted for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>. . . .
