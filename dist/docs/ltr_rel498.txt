...I am very anxious about you.  You have to move and make arrangements
to go to some point of safety, which you must select.  The Mount Vernon
plate and pictures ought to be secured.  Keep quiet while you remain
and in your preparation.  War is inevitable, and there is no telling
when it will burst around you.  Virginia, yesterday, I understand,
joined the Confederate States.  What policy they may adopt I cannot
conjecture.  May God bless and preserve you, and have mercy upon all
our people, is the constant prayer of your affectionate husband,
