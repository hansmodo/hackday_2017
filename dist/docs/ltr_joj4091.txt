Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
Since my last of 7th December last, and indeed for some 
time before that, Congress has been composed of so few 
States actually represented, as not to have it in their power 
to pay that attention to their foreign affairs which they 
would doubtless have otherwise' done. Hence it has happened that no resolutions have been entered into on any of 
the important subjects submitted to their consideration. 
This obliges me to observe a degree of reserve in my letters respecting those subjects, which I wish to be free from, 
but which is nevertheless necessary, lest my sentiments and 
opinions should be opposed to those which they may adopt 
and wish to impress. 
</p><p>
There is reason to hope that the requisition will be generally complied with ; I say generally, because it is not quite 
clear that every State without exception will make punctual payments. Although a disposition prevails to enable 
Congress to regulate trade, yet 1 am apprehensive, that 
however the propriety of the measure may be admitted, the manner of doing it will not be with equal ease 
agreed to. 
</p><p>
It is much to be regretted, that the confederation had not 
been so formed as to exclude the necessity of all such kind 
of questions. It certainly is very imperfect, and I fear it 
will be difficult to remedy its defects, until experience 
shall render the necessity of doing it more obvious and 
pressing. 
</p><p>
With great respect I have the honour to be, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
