SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to your Excellency, the evening of the 
20th, by Major Neville. I remained in the neighbourhood of Black Point till the afternoon following. 
The Count had received his expected despatches from 
Congress, and was to sail, as I mentioned before, the 
first fair wind. At Brunswick, yesterday, Mr. Caldwell joined me. He was immediately from the Point, 
and brought intelligence that the fleet got under 
way yesterday morning. The wind, unfortunately, 
has been much against them, which is so much the 
more to be regretted, as they are rather in want of 
water. I need not suggest to your Excellency that 
an essential part of the Rhode Island plan is, to take 
every possible measure to watch the enemy's motions, and to establish the expresses from place to 
place, to give the Count instant information of any 
movement among their fleet. This will enable him to be in time to intercept them, should they attempt 
to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> while he is at Rhode Island, 
and will, in general, facilitate the intercourse and co 
operation between him and your Excellency. 
</p><p>
I have nothing new to communicate, besides what 
was sent by Major Neville, and what I now send. 
All the ideas interchanged between the Count and 
myself were such as were familiar before I left 
head-quarters. He was to go to Rhode Island, and, 
in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>, endeavour to 
possess himself of the enemy's ships and troops there, 
if; on his arrival, he had good reason to think it 
could be effected without further assistance. If not, 
he will be glad of a reenforcement from you in the 
most expeditious manner possible. What manner you 
think will be most expeditious, you will adopt; and, 
if his aid may be useful, he will afford it as soon as 
he is informed of it. 
</p><p>
This being the case, my immediate presence at 
head-quarters is the less necessary, as to this business ; and I hope your Excellency will indulge me, 
if I do not make all the despatch back which a case 
of emergency would require, though I do not mean 
to delay more than a moderate attention to my frail 
constitution may make not improper.
