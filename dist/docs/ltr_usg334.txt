<i>biograper's note</i><p>[After Vicksburg, Grant began a tour of observation among the
important parts of his military rule. In October, <a href="/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>, the "Military
Division of the Mississippi" was created and Grant given the command.
This was composed of the Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and
the Tennessee. Headquarters were established at Nashville, which was
the most central point from which to communicate with his entire
military division. The winter was quiet, preparing for the campaign
against Atlanta. He says in this letter, "I am not a candidate for any
office." This refers, doubtless, to a proposal that he become a
candidate for the Presidency.]</p><hr>

DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
I have received your letter and those accompanying, to wit, Mr. Newton's and I.N. Morris'. I may write to Mr. Newton but it will be
different from what he expects. I am not a candidate for any office.
All I want is to be left alone to fight this war out; fight all rebel
opposition and restore a happy Union in the shortest possible time.
You know, or ought to know, that the public prints are not the proper
mediums through which to let a personal feeling pass. I know that I
feel that nothing personal to myself could ever induce me to accept a
political office.
</p><p>
From your letter you seem to have taken an active feeling, to say the
least, in this matter, that I would like to talk to you about. I could
write, but do not want to do so. Why not come down here and see me?
</p><p>
I did tell Julia to make a visit to Cincinnati, Batavia, Bethel and Georgetown.
</p>
ULYSSES.
