Dear Brother: I have already written you so much 
that more would be a bore. Yours of the 21st is at hand 
and I can act with promptness and sufficient vigor when 
the occasion arises. You all overrate my powers and 
abilities and may place me in a position above my merits, 
a worse step than below. Really I do not conceive 
myself qualified for Quartermaster General or Major 
General. To attain either station I would prefer a 
previous schooling with large masses of troops in the 
field, one which I lost in the Mexican War by going to 
California. The only possible reason that would induce 
me to accept my position would be to prevent its falling 
into incompetent hands. The magnitude of interest at 
issue now, will admit of no experiments. . . . 
</p><p>
I have still my saddle, sword, sash and some articles 
of Uniform which will come into immediate play. But 
look out I want the regular Army and not the 3 year 
men. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
