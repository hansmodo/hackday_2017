<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='6'>6th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Archer came, a classmate of my husband's at Princeton; they. called him Sally Archer then, he was so 
girlish and pretty. No trace of feminine beauty about this grim soldier now. He has a hard face, black-bearded and 
sallow, with the saddest black eyes. His hands are small, white, and well-shaped ; his manners quiet. He is abstracted 
and weary-looking, his mind and body having been deadened by long imprisonment. He seemed glad to be here, 
and James Chesnut was charmed. " Dear Sally Archer, " he calls him cheerily, and the other responds in a far-off, 
faded kind of way.

<a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> and Archer were given the two Texas regiments 
at the beginning of the war. They were colonels and Wigfall was their general. Archer's comments on <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> are: 
" He does not compare intellectually with General Johns 
ton, who is decidedly a man of culture and literary attainments, with much experience in military matters. <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a>, 
however, has youth and energy to help counterbalance all this. He has a simple-minded directness of purpose al 
ways. He is awfully shy, and he has suffered terribly, but then he has had consolations such a rapid rise in his profession, and then his luck to be engaged to the beautiful Miss ."

They tried Archer again and again on the heated controversy of the day, but he stuck to his text. <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> 
is a fine military critic, a capital writer, an accomplished soldier, as brave as Caesar in his own person, but cautious to 
a fault in manipulating an army. <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> has all the dash and fire of a reckless young soldier, and his Texans would 
follow him to the death. Too much caution might be followed easily by too much headlong rush. That is where the 
swing-back of the pendulum might ruin us.
