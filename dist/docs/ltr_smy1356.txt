MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="friend met">Anna</a>, I received yours by Mr. Taylor and duly delivered its inclosure. You can have no idea, my dear girl, 
what pleasant times I have ; there is the 
charming Chevalier, the divine Santana, 
the jolly Viar, the witty and agreeable 
Fatio, the black-eyed Lord Henry, the soft, 
love-making Count, the giggling, foolish, and sometimes the modest, good Meclare, who are at our house every day. We 
have fine riding-parties and musical frolics. 
However, I will refer you to my letter to your sister Madison, as I am tired of writing, this being my third letter to-day. 
</p><p>
Mr. and Mrs. Jandenes set sail about the middle of July, with the two dear little 
children in good health and remarkably fine spirits. I am to have a large packet 
of papers from them as soon as they arrive in Spain, telling me all the news, and also a very elegant Spanish guitar, on 
which I intend to learn to play. Signor Don Carlos has given me a few lessons on 
that instrument. I have one at present, lent me by Santana, and we have a famous 
Italian singer, who came with the Minister, who can play on any instrument, and is moreover the drollest creature you ever 
saw. He sings divinely, and is the leader of our fine concerts. I am serenaded 
every night with divine music. I must say divine, for it is so much above the common music. 
</p><p>
I long with the greatest impatience for the month of October, that I may have the 
pleasure of embracing my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="friend met">Anna</a> ; for Heaven s sake make as much haste to town 
as you can, for we are to have one of the most charming winters imaginable. Santana and Fatio send their compliments to 
you, and Meclare told me to be sure to give his best and most sincere love to you ; 
he looks quite handsome, and is smarter than ever. God bless you, my dearest, 
and believe me to be your sincere friend and admirer, 
</p><p>
