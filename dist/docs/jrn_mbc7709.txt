<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='26'>26th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. We went to see Mrs. Breckinridge, who is here with her husband. Then we paid our respects 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=mnc' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Lee</a>. Her room was like an industrial school : every body so busy. Her daughters were all there plying their 
needles, with several other ladies. <a href='/results.php?tla=mnc' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Lee</a> showed us a 
beautiful sword, recently sent to the General by some Marylanders, now in Paris. On the blade was engraved, Aide 
ioi et Dieu't aidera." When we came out someone said, "Did you see how the Lees spend their time ? What a rebuke to the taffy parties! "

General Breckinridge once asked, "What's the name of the fellow who has gone to Europe for <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood's</a> leg ? : Dr. Darby." " Suppose it is shipwrecked? " "No matter; half a dozen are ordered. Mrs. Preston raised her hands "No wonder the General says they talk of him as if he were a centipede ; his leg is in everybody's mouth."
