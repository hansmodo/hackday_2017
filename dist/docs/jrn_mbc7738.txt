<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='29'>29th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. I take my hospital duty in the morning. 
Most persons prefer afternoon, but I dislike to give up my pleasant evenings. So I get up at five o clock and go down 
in my carriage all laden with provisions. Mrs. Fisher and old Mr. Bryan generally go with me. Provisions are commonly sent by people to Mrs. Fisher's. I am so glad to be a hospital nurse once more. I had excuses enough, but at 
heart I felt a coward and a skulker. I think I know how men feel who hire a substitute and shirk the fight. There must be no dodging of duty. It will not do now to send provisions and pay for nurses. Something inside of me 
kept calling out, " Go, you shabby creature; you can't bear to see what those fine fellows have to bear.

Mrs. Izard was staying with me last night, and as I slipped away I begged Molly to keep everything dead still 
and not let Mrs. Izard be disturbed until I got home. About ten I drove up and there was a row to wake the dead. 
Molly's eldest daughter, who nurses her baby sister, let the baby fall, and, regardless of Mrs. Izard, as I was away, 
Molly was giving the nurse a switching in the yard, accompanied by howls and yells worthy of a Comanche! The 
small nurse welcomed my advent, no doubt, for in two seconds peace was restored. Mrs. Izard said she sympathized 
with the baby's mother ; so I forgave the uproar.

I have excellent servants; no matter for their short comings behind my back. They save me all thought as to 
household matters, and they are so kind, attentive, and quiet. They must know what is at hand if <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> is not 
hindered from coming here " Freedom! my masters! " 
But these sphinxes give no sign, unless it be increased diligence and absolute silence, as certain in their action and as 
noiseless as a law of nature, at any rate when we are in the house.

That fearful hospital haunts me all day long, and is worse at night. So much suffering, such loathsome wounds, 
such distortion, with stumps of limbs not half cured, exhibited to all. Then, when I was so tired yesterday, Molly 
was looking more like an enraged lioness than anything else, roaring that her baby's neck was broken, and howling cries 
of vengeance. The poor little careless nurse's dark face had an ashen tinge of gray terror. She was crouching near 
the ground like an animal trying to hide, and her mother striking at her as she rolled away. All this was my welcome 
as I entered the gate. It takes these half -Africans but a moment to go back to their naked savage animal nature.

Mrs. Izard is a charming person. She tried so to make me forget it all and rest.
