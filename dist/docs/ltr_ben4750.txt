MY DEAR CHILD, <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city origin'>London</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="10">Oct.</a> <a rel='day origin' value='5'>5</a>. <a href='/results.php?year=1768' rel="origin">1768</a>

It feels very strange to me to have Ships and Packets come 
in, and no Letters from you. But I do not complain of it, 
because I know the reason is, my having written to you that I 
was coming home. That you may not have the same disagreable Sensation, I write this Line, tho I have written 
largely by the late Ships, and therefore have little left to say. 
I have lately been in the Country to spend a few Days at 
Friends' Houses, and to breathe a little fresh Air. I have 
made no very long Journey this Summer as usual, finding 
myself in very good Health, a greater Share of which I believe 
few enjoy at my time of Life, but we are not to expect it will 
be always Sunshine. Cousin Folger, who is just arrived 
from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, tells me he saw our Son and Daughter Bache at 
that Place, and that they were going farther, being very well, 
which I was glad to hear. My love to them and all Friends, 
from your ever affectionate Husband, B. FRANKLIN.
