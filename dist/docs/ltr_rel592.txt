<p><i>[Biographer's note: When he first arrived, the family, very naturally, stood a little in
awe of him.  This feeling, however, was soon dispelled, for his simple
and unaffected manners in a short while put them at ease.  There were
some little children in the house, and they and the General at once
became great friends.  With these kind and hospitable friends he
stayed several days.  After being present at a meeting of the board
of trustees, he rode Traveller over to the Rockbridge Baths--eleven
miles from Lexington--and from there writes to my mother, on September
25th:]</i></p>

...Am very glad to hear of Rob's arrival.  I am sorry that I missed
seeing the latter, but find it was necessary that I should have been
present at the meeting of the board of trustees on the 20th.  They
adjourned on the eve of the 21st, and on the morning of the 22d I
rode over here, where I found Annie and Miss Belle [Mrs. Chapman Leigh
and Miss Belle Harrison, of Brandon, both very dear friends and cousins
of my father]....  The babies [Mrs. Leigh's] are well and sweet.  I have
taken the baths every day since my arrival, and like them very much.
In fact, they are delightful, and I wish you were all here to enjoy
them....  Annie and Belle go in two, and sometimes three, times a day.
Yesterday I procured some horses and took them up to the top of Jump
Mountain, where we had one of the most beautiful views I ever saw.
To-day I could get but one horse, and Miss Belle and I rode up Hays
Creek Valley, which possessed beauties of a different kind.  I shall
return to Lexington on the 29th.  I perceive, as yet, no change in my
rheumatic affection....  Tell Custis I am much obliged to him for his
attention to my baggage.  All the articles enumerated by him arrived
safely at Colonel Reid's Thursday morning early.  I also received the
package of letters he sent....  I hope he may receive the appointment
at the V. M. I.  Everyone interested has expressed a desire he should
do so, and I am more desirous than all of them.  If he comes by land,
he will find the route I took very pleasant, and about 108 miles,
namely:  'Bremo'--Dr. Wilmer's--Waynesboro'--Greenville.  He will find
me at the Lexington Hotel....  I wish you were all here with me.  I
feel very solitary and miss you all dreadfully.  Give much love to
the girls and boys--kind remembrances to Mrs. P., Miss Louisa, and
Mrs. Thos. Cocke.  I have no news.  Most affectionately,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>
</p><p>
P.S.--Annie and Belle send a great deal of love to all.  R. E. L.

<i>[Biographer's note:
These little excursions and the meeting with old friends and dear
cousins were sources of real enjoyment and grateful rest.  The pains
of the past, the worries of the present, and the cares for the future
were, for the time being, banished.
