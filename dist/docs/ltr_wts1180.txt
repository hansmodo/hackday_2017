Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
As I expected, I am on the detail, and have official 
notice that I shall be required in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>, Tuesday, 
August 6th. . . . 
</p><p>
I got your message from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=napoleon" rel="city">Napoleon</a>. He sent me a 
similar message by Schofield, but I would hardly venture 
to France as the representative of our military system, 
as it would subject me to heavy expense and much 
trouble. 
</p><p>
Grant told me he would not accept a nomination for 
President, and if he departs from this, his natural conclusion, it will be by side influence, and because no good 
candidate has thus far been brought forward by the ruling party. I don't think he has clearly defined political 
opinions, but would let Congress and the departments 
work out the problem of the future, which is probably 
better than to form a theory and force matters to conform to it. ... 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>.
