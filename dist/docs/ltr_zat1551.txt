My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your welcome and interesting letter of the 25th  ult was duly rec d for 
which you have my sincere thanks. I have commenced the movement 
at last on Monteray & Saltillo nearly all the regular troops are now 
under march for the interior, with a few of the Volunteers ; the whole I 
expect will be so by Monday ; I shall leave for Surralvo myself on Saturday the 6 th to join the advance at that place, near half way between 
this & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>. The whole force I shall take with me, will be near 
six thousand men, half regulars the balance volunteers. We are in some 
respects indifferently supplied, but I became doubtful if I depended on 
the Q r Masters dep to complete the necessary arrangements so far as the 
same was concerned, not only the time of the twelve months would 
expire before they were completed, but the regulars likewise, so I thought 
it best to leave at once & get to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> & Saltillo as soon as our legs 
could carry us there unless stopped by the enemy or some causes on the 
way which I do not expect will be the case ; whether the enemy will fight 
us time must determine ; opinions on that subject are much at variance ; 
should they fight we must beat them, or find honorable graves. Wells 
has not yet arrived, we are very much in want here of medicines & supplies of various kinds ; it is probable we will have to wait a few days for 
them ; or they will have to follow us ; as they were very particularly 
needed the Q r Master shipped them on the slowest boat on the river, 
whether by design or accident I am unable to say 
</p><p>
I am gratified in believing the sick both regulars & volunteers who 
have fallen under your care have been taken good care of, & I know it 
will continue to be so I direct an order to be issued, that you would 
have such of the sick brought over from the Rio Grande to Fort Polk, 
as you might think advisable, or as you could accommodate them ; the 
volunteers have a very large sick report at this place, & a good many 
deaths ; poor fellows they have a very hard time of it no hospitals, & I 
greatly fear, very poor medical advisers ; I can but feel very sensibly for 
them. I have directed competent medical aid to be employed whenever 
it can be met with also that Majr Gardner & Col Clark 1 should discharge such volunteers who were able & wished to return to their homes 
I regret I cannot send a proper officer to S c Joseph s discharge all there 
unfit for service, break up the establishment & order Hawkins in the 
field, but things must remain as they are for the present 
</p><p>
I am satisfied the volunteer officers who are left behind, will express 
great dissatisfaction, but this I cannot help, the country expects us to do 
or attempt something, & they shall not be disappointed ; even if it 
should turn out to be a disaster. The whole system of volunteers at best 
is defective but made much worse than it might be, by the mismanage 
ment of the same, by those who control it for political effect, which is the 
case in the present instance. Volunteers were never intended to invad or 
carry on war out of the limits of their own country, but should be used, 
as the constitution intended they should be for enforcing the execution 
of the laws ; & repelling invasion, for which they are admirably suited. 
There is but little doubt in my mind, if this war continues for any length 
of time, it will completely break down the administration. The two 
million plan which failed in the senate, induces me to believe judging 
from the message connected with it, that the executive has some plan or 
expectation of closing the war by negotiation I therefor regret the money 
was not placed at his disposal 1 The last mail brought me a letter of the 
12 th ult from Betty she was then quite well ; Dick who had returned was 
much better ; but her mother was not well, from the effects of a bad 
cold. There were still at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> but would leave there in a few days 
for some of the watering places on the lake back of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, where 
they would spend a few weeks, & then return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a>. I was truly 
gratified to learn you had heard from Ann as late as the 2 d of Aug r & 
that her & the children were all well ; the heat appears to be very oppressive throughout the country, but it must be trifling there in comparison 
to what it is here ; but at any rate it lasts there but a few weeks, & I 
think the winters in that quarter are much more to be dreaded than the 
summers even warm as they are ; I am more than obliged to her for her 
kind remembrance. 
</p><p>
The war must end some time or other, & that I trust before a very 
great while, when should you continue to its close you will be certainly 
entitled to a good station whether you get it or not ; as I have remarked 
before the only consideration in the whole matter is that Ann & the 
children were located at some eligible position where they were satisfied 
during your absence; seperation with army & navy officers & their 
families are inevitable, & should be calculated on, & should at all times be 
prepared to meet such occurrences without complaining however much 
they may be inconvenienced by the same, particularly if they cannot 
remedy it. I much fear Anns dislike to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> is more imaginary than 
real, yet I truly wish she was comfortably located somewhere else, particularly if she was better satisfied, & I think you have done right in 
leaving her free to go any other place, as she may think best. The boys 
no doubt give her much trouble, as well as great anxiety, but would either 
be less anywhere else. We should do the best for our children in our 
power ; instilling into their minds at an early age the necessity of good 
principles as regards honesty and truth, as well as good morals, encourage 
them in the propriety of employment of some kind or other, & give 
them a taste for reading, after which they must take their chances, & we 
must try & be satisfied let matters as regards them eventuate as they may. 
</p><p>
If they turn out well it will be a source of the greatest possible gratification to their parents, should they do badly the reverse will be the case in 
like proportion. Let us do our duty to them & others, to the best of 
our ability & bear up against what may afterward occur even if unfavorable, at least with propriety & resignation in the best way we can As 
I stated to you in my last I regretted to hear that Rob had quit school & 
returned home as I fear his doing so will cause his mother much uneasiness. I do not know how John can be well sparred from home until 
you return ; if he could have a proper instructor it seem to me he would 
be as well for him to be with his mother as any where else for the present It is perhaps as well if not better not to make too favorable calcu 
lations in favor of our children in early life for should they fail to meet or 
come up to them the disappointment will be felt with double the effect it 
would be under different circumstances 
</p><p>
Mays promotion to the rank of L Col by brevet as well as that of 
some others who I learn have rec d two grades at once for the same affair, 
an extraordinary proceeding to say the least of it, & shows they had good 
friends at court ; but I shall take no acception to the matter, nor attempt 
to animadvert on the same, farther than to say they were in luck 
</p><p>
I make no calculations on appointments for the boys at West Point 
or in the navy ; if they apply, or applicates is made for them & they succeed very well, if not I hope they will be able to get on without them ; 
success in those matters are extremely doubtful, with exception of some 
families, the whole of whom must be provided for in this as well as other 
countries Unless the application referred to was made direct to the 
president it is doubtful if he ever saw it 
</p><p>
The last mail brought us a com" from Gen h d quarters that it was 
the wish of the dep or the Gen in chief that Dr Wells who has this 
moment arrived with the supplies, should be permitted to leave the 
country as soon as the officers of the Medical dep now on their way 
here or are to come arrive ; this I informed the dep I should not do, 
unless the war was brought to a close Wishing you continued health 
& prosperity I remain

You must not expect long letters from me for the time to come ; 
they will be quite brief until I get to Saltillo My love to Ann & the 
children when you write
