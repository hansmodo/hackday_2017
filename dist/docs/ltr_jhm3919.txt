SIR: 
</p><p>
I this day received your letter of the 19th inst., enclosing me a return 
of the state of Maham's corps, at which I am exceedingly chagrined 
indeed, for it appears there are no more than seventeen men whose time 
of service will not expire in a month or six weeks. This deficiency, 
together with that in the corps brought into the regiment by Conyers, 
makes the regiment at least but a skeleton, when I expected the State 
would have had the services of a very respectable corps; and, to add 
to the misfortune, I cannot command the means of making it better. 
I have, in two or three instances, involved myself in a vast deal of 
trouble, by making engagements which I thought I should have been 
able to comply with; but, on experience, have found myself deceived, 
and, in consequence of which, I have embarrassed myself exceedingly, 
and brought on myself much unmerited censure, for which reason I 
am determined never to pass my word for a guinea, without I have the 
means in my hands of fulfilling the contract the moment it becomes 
due; therefore, I have no present means in my hands, nor the least 
prospect of any before the meeting of the Legislature. It is utterly 
out of my power to furnish the money to re-engage Maham's men. I 
can only lament the injury the State must be subject to by this unlucky 
circumstance, for it is not in my power to remedy the evil. As a body 
of horse will be what we shall most want when <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> leaves us 
(which he will do immediately, as the town is evacuated) I think the 
best way of disposing of the regiment will be to select the best of the 
accoutrements and horses, and mount the whole of the men that are 
retained, and form them again into a regiment of cavalry, and let them 
remain thus until the meeting of the Legislature, which I shall call together immediately on the evacuation of the town. As you are well 
acquainted with the state of the corps, 1 should be glad to have your sentiments on the matter. The enclosed is a copy of my letter to you 
by Col. Moultrie, who, being taken and carried into town, suppose the letter is lost. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
