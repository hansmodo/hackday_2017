MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>,
</p><p>
It is now near the midnight hour, and yet, late as it is, I could not
acquit myself to my conscience if I had not again written you before I
left this place, which will be early tomorrow. My life is quite in the
militant style--one continued scene of warfare. From this place I go
down to the Supreme Court at Trenton, which will be on Tuesday next,
and the Tuesday after that I shall return once more to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=morristown" rel="city">Morristown</a>, and
when I shall leave it will be uncertain. I rejoice when the hour of
rest comes up, and sicken at the approach of day. Business fairly
bears me down. The truth is, that I am tired of writing, tired of
reading, tired of bustling in a crowd, and, by fits, heartily tired of
myself.
</p><p>
I hope you go on gaining strength, and that you will in a little while
get the better of your disorder. The mind and the body affect each
other extremely. To a person in your state, hilarity, cheerfullness, a
serene flow of spirits, are better than all the drugs in a doctor's
shop. Gentle exercise is of infinite service. I hope you are not
wanting in any of these. If you are, I cannot easily pardon you,
because they are all within your power.
</p><p>
Make my compliments acceptable to the family at the Hermitage. I have
a high regard for them, and sincerely wish their happiness. I really
pity and admire <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thb" rel="met friend">Mrs. Prevost</a>. Her situation demands a tear; her
conduct and demeanour the warmest applause. Tell <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thb" rel="met friend">Mrs. Prevost</a> that she
must remember me among her friends; and that I shall be happy to
render her all the service in my power.
</p><p>
Since I have been at this place I have had a letter from Mrs.
Paterson, who is well. Our little girl, who was indisposed when I left
home, is not worse. I flatter myself I shall find her better when I
return. Alas, that I cannot be more at home. A husband and a parent
have a thousand tendernesses that you know nothing of. Adieu, my dear
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>; live and be happy.
</p><p>
