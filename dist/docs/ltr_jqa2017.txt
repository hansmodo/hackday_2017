MY DEAR MADAM : 
</p><p>
I know not of any news. The principal topic of conversation this week has been the arrival of the Columbia from 
an expedition which has carried her round the world. The adventurers after having their expectations raised to the 
highest pitch, were utterly disappointed, and instead of the immense profits upon which they had calculated, will 
scarcely have their outsets refunded to them. This failure has given universal astonishment and is wholly attributed 
to the Captain, whose reputation now remains suspended between the qualifications of egregious knavery and of 
unpardonable stupidity. Mr. Barrell, I am informed, is not discouraged, but intends to make the experiment once 
more, and if he should not meet with anybody disposed to second him, they say he will undertake it at his single risk 
and expense. The people of the vessel have brought home a number of curiosities, similar to those which you have 
seen at Sir Ashton Lever's Museum. They have likewise brought a native of the Sandwich Islands, who bound 
himself as a servant to one of the passengers. He was paraded up and down our streets yesterday, in the dress of 
his country, and as he speaks our language has been con 
versed with by many gentlemen in this town. One of the 
passengers it is said has kept a very accurate journal of 
the voyage and proposes to extract from it a relation for 
publication. It will probably be curious ; though among 
uncivilized and barbarous nations it appears to me the observations of travellers must generally consist chiefly in 
a repetition of what was noticed by the first adventurer 
who discovered them. The situation of a country and 
whatever relates to inanimate matter continues the same. 
The peculiarities of the animal creation when once re 
marked, seldom afford any further field for information. 
It is from man that we must always derive our principal 
source of entertainment and instruction. And although 
the knowledge of the human heart may perhaps be promoted by inferences drawn from the manners and customs 
of a people newly discovered, yet the savage inhabitants of a petty island, cannot have many customs or opinions 
which may not be discoverable to the first man who becomes acquainted with them.
