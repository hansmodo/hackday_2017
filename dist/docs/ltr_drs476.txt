Carthage, Tenn. March 21/63<br/>
My Dear Friend:
</p><p>
   Your favor of March 10th
was duly received and I
wrote an answer and mailed
it day before yesterday, but
I have just learned that
the mail was captured by
the Guerillas between here &
Gallatin, so I will have it
to do all over again.

 </p><p>   So you have committed
matrimony, have you? Or
were you only joking? If
you really have "gone and
done it" allow me to congratulate you on your choice
and to wish you and your
bride a happy voyage together down the stream of life,
together with the "little responsibilities". I am sorry
however to lose you from
among the noble fraternity of
Batchelors. I fear that the
joys and cures of matrimony may induce you to forget your friends who have
not yet joined the Benedictine order.
</p><p>
   The fact is I intend to
take me an helpmeat myself
from among Pennsylvania's
fair daughters, some day --
p-e-r-h-a-p-s. With this
view I expect you to spread
a good word for me to all
the "genuine fenders" and it
may be I can find some one
fool enough to have me. --
</p><p>
I quite agree with you in regard to the wish you express in regard to that holding affair.
</p><p>
Since I last wrote to you
we have "changed our base" to
the north side of the Cumberland river as it was getting
quite unhealthy on the other
side. A forage train of 18
six-mule teams [ was captured
on the 6th] together with the
escort of 62 men from our
regiment was captured on
the 6th, and hardly a night
passed without some of our
pickets being shot. Since we
crossed we have not been
troubled in that way. Four
of our boats were fired into yesterday 7 miles below
here and two men wound=
ed. Our gun-boat shelled the town ( Rome) and the adjacent roads and quite a num
ber of the rebs were killed. --
The town was nearly burned
to the ground. We are every
day expecting an attack from
Gen'l Bragg, who has lately been
heavily reinforced. We are also
expecting reinforcements. --
The small pox has made its
appearance here in some of
our regiments. Otherwise the
health is good.
</p><p>
   This is about all the local
news. With the generally news
you are better acquainted, I presume, than I am.
</p><p>
   The weather is quite fine
and ploughing and gardening
is the order of the day among
the citizens. In that respect
I presume they are about three weeks ahead of you.
</p><p>
   Our regiment was today
furnished with bran new
Norfolk Rifles (Springfield
pattern) I am quite proud
of mine, which I call "Katie
Darling" and I am anxious
to draw a bead on a rebel
with it. I intend to sleep
with it to=night.
</p><p>
    Give my respects to your
lady and all the friends, and
write soon
</p><p>
Yours Truly<br/>
