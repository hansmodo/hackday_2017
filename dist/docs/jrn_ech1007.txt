Yesterday morning fried mush was promised us for breakfast this morning, and when breakfast time came we were informed that we would have to wait for it until tomorrow morning. This the boys were not agreed to, and Mr. Schroyer proceeded forthwith to the galley and by a well-arranged coup de main succeeded in obtaining a well-filled pan of fried mush intended for the upper cabin, and brought it down to our table. It was soon divided, but it had hardly been placed upon our plates before the Captain came down and demanded why we had taken their mush, stating at the same time that they would have nothing. We replied that it was our turn and it had been promised us yesterday. He then turned on his heel, swore we should have no more flour or corn meal, and left. He went immediately to the steward and ordered him to allow us no more bread or mush, but this order was subsequently countermanded as we had fresh bread for supper.

About nine o'clock the joyful cry of "Land, ho!" was heard and by going aloft to the fore-topsail guard, I was able to see the dim outline of several ridges of land. At this first sight of the land of promise, oh, how my heart leaped with joy! The water had changed in appearance from the dark blue of the wide ocean to the dirty green always found near shore. By noon we could discern several specks in the distance, which we supposed to be vessels, but subsequently they proved to be three clusters of rugged rocks about 25
miles distant from the entrance to the bay of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. The land became plainer and plainer as we approached, and at sunset we were so near that we could discern the trees on top of the distant hills.
<p></p>
Soon after sunset, which was the most beautiful ever witnessed, a dark mist or fog arose, obscuring objects in the distance. A fair wind was carrying us gallantly forward, but it was growing darker and darker every moment. At six o'clock we crossed the bar, but the Captain not deeming it safe to enter at this time of night gave the order to "wear ship." We stood out for sea, deeming it prudent to get a little way off, and then lie to and enter in the morning. The vessel had hardly come about when a bright light was seen in the distance, supposed to be a light on shore. It soon became brighter and brighter, and in a little time a dark speck was seen rapidly approaching. We supposed it to be a steamer coming out and as we had not our signal light out, we were apprehensive that whatever it was, it would run into us. A light was immediately raised and as she approached, our Captain sung out to the stranger to bear off.
<p></p>
In less time than it requires to write this, the craft was close alongside of us, and enquired if we wished a pilot. Our Captain replied, "Aye! Aye!" This was joyful intelligence to us all. In ten minutes the pilot was aboard and took command of the vessel. Three hearty cheers were then given by us for him.
<p></p>
We have come to anchor, in consequence of the wind dying away, within a stone's throw of the northern shore of the entrance to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> where it is only about a mile wide. Now, 10:30 P. M., all our boys have turned in, hoping to get into port tomorrow.
