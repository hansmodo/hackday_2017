<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> has appointed an ample representation in our Congress, and has appointed a provincial Congress. The people of the city have seized the city 
arms and ammunition out of the hands of the Mayor, who is a creature of the Governor. Lord North will 
certainly be disappointed in his expectation of seducing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. The tories there durst not show 
their heads. The Jerseys are aroused, and greatly assist the friends of liberty in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. North Carolina has done bravely ; chosen the old delegates 
in provincial Congress, and then confirmed the choice in general assembly, in opposition to all that Governor Martin could do. The assembly of this colony is 
now sitting at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hartford" rel="city">Hartford</a>. We are treated with great tenderness, sympathy , friendship, and respect. Every thing is doing by this colony that can be done by 
men, both for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. Keep your 
spirits composed and calm, and Don't suffer yourself to be disturbed by idle reports and frivolous alarms. We shall see better times yet. Lord North 
is ensuring us success. I am wounded to the heart with the news, this moment told me, of Josiah Quincy's death.
