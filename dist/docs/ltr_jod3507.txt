MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MR. COLMAN goes off for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to-morrow. I have 
seized a moment to congratulate you on the great and 
glorious success of our arms at the northward and in 
Delaware river. The forts at Province Island and 
Redbank have been defended with a magnanimity 
which will give our country a reputation in Europe. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel=''>Colonel Greene</a> repulsed the enemy from Redbank and 
took Count Donop and his aid prisoners. Colonel Smith repulsed a bold attack upon fort Mifflin, and 
our galleys disabled two men of war, a sixty-four and 
a twenty-gun ship, in such a manner, that the enemy blew them up. This comes confirmed this even 
ing, in letters from <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>, enclosing 
original letters from officers in the forts. 
</p><p>
Congress will appoint a thanksgiving ; and one 
cause of it ought to be, that the glory of turning the 
tide of arms is not immediately due to the Commander-in-chief nor to southern troops. If it had been, 
idolatry and adulation would have been unbounded ; 
so excessive as to endanger our liberties, for what I 
know. Now, we can allow a certain citizen to be 
wise, virtuous and good without thinking him a deity 
or a saviour.
