SIR: 
</p><p>
The evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, and the highest probability that St. 
Augustine is likewise evacuated, offer so fair an opportunity of obliging the enemy to abandon the post they hold in this State, that it would 
be criminal not to make the attempt. I must, therefore, desire you 
would immediately draft one-half of your brigade, and as many more 
within eighty miles of Charlestown (agreeably to the law) as will be 
consistent with the safety of the country, and immediately put them in 
motion, and join the army under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>. If 
the men will now do their duty with cheerfulness and punctuality, I think 
I may almost venture to assure them this will be the last grand effort 
they will be called upon to make. I hope you have finished the business you are at present upon, before you receive this; if not, pray expedite it as much as possible, so that that may not interfere with the 
great object. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jhm" rel="me">JOHN MATTHEWS</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. It will be so long between the time of your receiving this 
and your orders respecting this brigade, and the service of, at least, a 
part of the men being immediately required, that I have given the 
necessary orders to these three regiments. The Commanding Officer at 
<a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> is to forward this letter by express, with all possible expedition.
