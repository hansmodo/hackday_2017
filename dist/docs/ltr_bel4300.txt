I have since my return, my dear General, been looking, agreeably to your request, among my young friends, to see whether I could find among them one 
who would answer your purpose as a private Secretary, &c., &c. I have at last found a Mr. Lear, who supports the character of a gentleman and a scholar. 
He was educated at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, in this State. Since 
he left college he has been in Europe and in different parts of this Continent. It is said that he is a 
good master of language ; he reads French, and writes an exceeding good letter that his abilities are surpassed by few, and his integrity by none. From the 
best information I can obtain, I am induced to believe that you will find him the man you described. 
For a more particular account of character and intellect, I beg leave to refer you to the inclosed ' letter 
from my son to me. He has an intimate knowledge of Mr. Lear. If you should now be in want of his services, he will, by the first opportunity, join your Excellency's family.

The Council of the American Academy have had a meeting here this day. Among other communications 
we had a very interesting one from the Reverend Mr. West, of Dartmouth, a gentleman of great abilities and extensive information. He wrote on the 
subject of extracting, by a simple machine, without the use of fire, fresh water from salt. He informed the Academy that he was admitted into the secret 
by the original inventor of the operation, and that they are now attempting some improvements upon it. 
However, thus far they had reduced the matter to a certainty, that three gallons of good fresh water could 
be extracted from a certain quantity of sea water (I think a barrel) in seventy or eighty minutes. He 
hoped, by some little amendments they were attempting, that double that quantity would be produced in the same time. Should they never improve upon the 
present discovery, it must be considered as a very important one. With great esteem and regard,
