I wrote from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> on the nineteenth, just before we marched for this place. We were then nearly 
worn out with fatigue and started in bad spirits. Indeed the treatment which the army has received from 
the Administration, and the injustice done by the 
brevets, has disgusted and dispirited many of us, particularly in our regiment, which has done so much 
service and been so entirely overlooked. ... I have 
recently been less regular in my correspondence than 
I desire to be, but I have been so situated that I could 
not even write a journal. We carry no baggage but a 
pair of saddle bags and a small roll of bedding and are 
without tents. I am now sitting on the ground writing 
on the top of a box. . . . We are to march to Perote, 
forty miles from here, tomorrow, to join General 
Worth, to whose division we belong. As I told you 
in my last we made our preparations to leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> on the nineteenth. . . . Just before dark we 
commenced our march moving over the sandy plain 
to the north of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>. Our teams were drawn by 
the wild mustang horses we had brought from Tlacatalpin, which were perfectly unbroken and could not be 
made to go. In consequence drag ropes were fastened 
to the wagons and our poor men were compelled not 
only to draw them but the horses, too. After toiling 
some hours we halted at a small stream of bad water 
where it united with the sea about three miles from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>. I refreshed myself with a delicious bath 
in the tumbling surf and " with my martial cloak 
around me " slept on the sands till four in the morning. 
We then started on our weary route, toiling over the 
deep sand dragging the wagons and gradually break 
ing our horses to their work. 
</p><p>
We made but six miles that day and bivouacked at 
the small town of Santa Fe. All day we had been 
hearing reports of the terrible battle of Cerro Gordo. 
</p><p>
Our march on the twenty-first commenced at three 
o clock in the morning and was over a hilly country, 
but on a tolerably good road. Our horses began to 
work very well for mustangs, and we labored on under 
a burning tropical sun, some of the men breaking 
down from the intense heat, till nine o clock in the 
morning, when we halted near some water where there 
was a fine shade, and rested six hours. Several cattle 
out of the immense droves around us were shot, and we 
all got a good dinner. We could not march during the 
middle of the day, for there was a breathless calm and 
the sun would have melted men and horses in an hour. 
</p><p>
We struck Santa Anna's farm about twelve miles 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>. It is thirty miles wide and extends 
to within a short distance of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>, making it about 
fifty miles long. It is said there are more than sixty 
thousand cattle roaming over its pastures to say 
nothing of the sheep and horses. 
</p><p>
About four in the afternoon we resumed our march 
and continued on into the night having made about 
sixteen miles. At the usual hour in the morning we 
proceeded and at ten in the morning reached the 
famous Puente Nacional, much the most remarkable 
bridge I have ever seen, stretching with many heavy 
stone arches over a beautiful, rapid mountain stream. 
The bridge lies in a natural pass which a few brave 
men might defend against armies. 
</p><p>
Above it on the summit of a lofty hill frowns a 
massive stone fort. The town at the northwest end 
of the bridge which usually contains several hundred 
inhabitants, we found, with the exception of a few men, 
entirely deserted. On a hill on the border of the village 
is a magnificent residence, one of Santa Anna s countryseats, at which we spent the day, the men refresh 
ing themselves by bathing. At six in the evening the 
advance sounded we marched off, up hill for two or 
three miles, when we found the road quite level and 
excellent. We were occasionally shocked by the sight 
of some poor soldier who had been shot by the wayside 
and whose unsepulchred remains were rotting on the 
ground. The road began to be strewed with the offen 
sive bodies of dead horses and cattle, and the fragments of broken wagons, etc., which are ever scattered 
behind an army. We marched on steadily until about 
two in the morning, when after descending a very long 
steep hill down which the road winds we halted at the 
town of Plan del Rio, four miles from the battle field of 
Cerro Gordo. Every hut, every place of shelter was 
found filled with the wounded. 
</p><p>
We had marched after sunset eighteen miles, and 
as soon as we halted the weary men dropped on the 
rugged, dirty earth, the officers promiscuously scattered among them. I was officer of the day and as 
soon as I had posted a few sentinels I lay down in the 
very dust and dirt of the road with no bed or covering 
but my cloak, and in spite of the groans of the wounded 
and the shrieks of those who were suffering from the 
knives of the surgeons, I slept soundly for three hours. 
</p><p>
In the morning I visited those of my friends who 
were wounded, among whom is Poet Patten, all his 
left hand but the forefinger and thumb having been 
carried off by a grape shot. He was doing well and is 
very cheerful. I consoled him with the fact that 
though he could no longer play the guitar he might 
write better poetry than before. 
</p><p>
Here was to be seen every stage of suffering from 
wounds, but I will not describe to you the sickening 
scenes I have witnessed. We marched at five in the 
afternoon, being still twenty miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>. We 
moved rapidly until we reached the battle field, which 
was at a pass that a few brave men ought to hold 
against the united world. It is three miles long, and 
by far the strongest I have ever seen. I have not tune 
to record the various anecdotes I have heard or to 
give a detailed description of the battle. It is certainly the most dreadful defeat the Mexicans have 
ever yet received and yet so confident were they of 
victory that the citizens of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> rode to the ground 
to see the rout of our army and fireworks were prepared at various points to celebrate the flight of the 
" North Americans." Santa Anna publicly took an 
oath at the altar to conquer or leave his body on the 
field. N. B. He was among the first to run. 
</p><p>
At two o clock yesterday we reached this place, the 
prettiest town I have seen, surrounded by the finest 
country with the most delicious climate in the world, 
the thermometer never rising above eighty degrees or 
falling much below sixty. A cloth coat is never uncomfortable, and one does not suffer in his shirt 
sleeves. It is more than four thousand feet above the 
level of the sea. Fruit and vegetables are abundant 
and cheap. 
</p><p>
There are some very ancient buildings here I 
have seen but one yet, a chapel built by Hernando 
Cortes. There is now a large Franciscan monastery 
attached to it and the National College. 
</p><p>
The battle of Cerro Gordo is not likely to terminate 
the war as we supposed. The Mexicans appear determined never to give up even if we should take every 
town and fortress in the nation. What a stupid people 
they are! They can do nothing and their continued 
defeats should convince them of it. They have lost 
six great battles; we have captured six hundred and 
eighty cannon, nearly one hundred thousand stand of 
arms, made twenty thousand prisoners, have posses 
sion of the greatest portion of their country and are 
fast advancing upon their Capital which must soon 
be ours, yet they refuse to treat! "Those the 
gods wish to destroy, they first make mad." . . .
