My Dear Brother: I have been here ever since you 
left, hardly taking off my clothes at night. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> 
is so confident that Beauregard will attack that I try to 
be prepared at all times. Our forts are in pretty good 
condition, but whether the volunteers can serve the guns 
or not is to be tested. It does seem to me strange that 
when all know that if Beauregard get <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, the 
Southern Confederacy will be an established fact that 
they should leave volunteers to hold the most important 
point in the world. Out of my seven regiments three 
are in a state of mutiny, and I have been compelled to 
put about 100 men as prisoners on board a man-of-war. 
And yesterday I had my Regulars all ready with shotted 
guns to fire on our own troops, some of whom not only 
claim their discharge, but threaten to spike our guns. 
They claim to be only 3 months men, whereas the War 
Department claims their services for 3 years. Even 
some of the 3 years men say the President had no right 
to call for 3 years men and that the subsequent legislation of Congress was ex-post facto. . . .

General McDowell commanded the Union army of about 28,000 men, 
and Sherman, then a colonel, commanded a brigade in this army.

A few days since Gen. Robert Anderson sent for me 
to meet him at Willard's. I found him with Senator 
Johnson, a Mr. Maynard, and several other members from 
Kentucky and Tennessee. They told me the President 
had resolved to send assistance to the Union men of 
Kentucky and Tennessee, that Anderson being a Kentuckian to him was given the lead, and that he was 
allowed to select three Brigadiers, that he had chosen 
me first and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside</a> and Thomas next. The President 
agreed, but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> would not spare me till the danger 
in his front was lessened. It was then agreed to wait 
a week, when if nothing happens here I am to be ordered 
into Kentucky. As I understand we are to go there in 
person, mingle with the people, satisfy ourselves of their 
purpose to oppose the Southern Confederacy and then to 
assist in the organization there of a force adequate to the 
end in view, that when Kentucky is assured in her allegiance that we then push into East Tennessee. I feel 
well satisfied that unless Kentucky and Tennessee remain 
in our Union it is a doubtful question whether the Federal Government can restore the old Union. . . .

There is no time to be lost and I will not spare my 
individual efforts, though I still feel as one groping in 
the dark. Slowly but surely the public is realizing what 
I knew all the time, the strong vindictive feeling of the 
whole South.

Your Brother,
