SIR, 
</p><p>
By the resolve in Congress of the 19th instant, it 
is recommended to the New England Colonies to complete the deficiencies in the -regiments belonging to 
them respectively. I have not been informed of any deficiency in the number of troops sent from Connecticut, It is recommended also to this Colony to complete and send for 
ward to the camp before <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, as soon as possible, the fourteen hundred men lately voted by our Assembly. 
The 25th instant I sent orders to the Colonels of the last raised regiments to march forthwith to the camp 
before <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, by subdivisions, if all were not in readiness. I. expect many of the companies will begin 
their march this day, and that the whole will move forward very soon. 
</p><p>
The Honorable <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>President Hancock</a>, in his favor of 
the 22d instant, informs that you had recommended, 
and the Congress have appointed, Mr. Joseph Trumbull 
Commissary-General of the American Army. I am also 
informed that you have taken Mr. John Trumbull into 
your service and family. These instances of kindness 
shown them justly claim my most grateful acknowledgments. A performance of their duty, answerable to 
your expectation, will meet your approbation and 
continuance of regard, and afford me peculiar satis 
faction and pleasure. 
</p><p>
The Rose, Swan, and Kingfisher, ships of war, with a 
small tender, the 26th instant came into the harbour at 
New London. On the 27th some men landed near the 
light-house, broke off the nuts, and plugged up with old 
files three or four cannon. They sailed out again on 
Friday last. It is reported Mr. Collector Stuart is packing  up his effects, in order to leave that port, I am, 
with great truth and regard, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
