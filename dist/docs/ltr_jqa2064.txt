TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 27 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, February 25th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
. . . March $th. The province of Friesland is now 
represented in the States General regenerated. That 
Assembly have appointed two Ministers Plenipotentiary to the French Republic, one of them is the same person who 
some time since addressed the Convention as a Batavian Deputy. The object of their present commission is for 
mally to demand again an alliance between the two Republics as free and independent nations. 
</p><p>
Three of the Professors at the University of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=leyden" rel="city">Leyden</a> have 
been dismissed. One of them, Mr. Pestel, has been distinguished by several works relating to the Constitution of this 
Republic. Even the temple of the Muses is no sanctuary now, and the Patriots upon this occasion imitate an example 
of similar exclusion heretofore given by their adversaries. 
</p><p>
The States General have published an address to the 
troops proposing to them a new engagement. By way of 
attaching them to the new system they promise that in 
future the soldiers shall not be subject to the discipline of 
blows, that they shall be free to marry without being 
obliged to obtain the permission of their captain, and that 
promotion in future shall be conferred only upon merit or 
experience, and not by favor. 
</p><p>
Some of the adherents to the former government to counteract the operation of these regulations say, that they are 
not sufficiently liberal and think that the choice of the officers should also be conferred upon the troops. 
</p><p>
The prospect of a general pacification, which has appeared 
opening during the course of the winter, becomes daily 
more distant and obscure. At present a campaign no less 
violent and bloody than the last appears probable. The 
Emperor, assisted by a loan of money made in England, 
and another loan at Vienna, together with a free gift from 
the States of Hungary, seems determined upon a last and violent exertion to obtain honorable terms of peace from 
the French Republic. The King of Prussia negotiates for a general negotiation, and makes some scruple to sign a 
separate peace. He will perhaps continue the war through the ensuing season as he did through the last, and it is 
questionable whether the French will carry the war much further into his dominions. 
</p><p>
One would not suppose that the present is a moment for indulging the ambition of conquest in this country. Yet 
from the vicinity of Westphalia and the Duchy of Olden burg the dominant party contains individuals who are of 
opinion, that the French Republicans will very soon under take and perform this conquest, and then annex these 
territories to the Batavian Republic. Some of them suppose that the expedition said to be directed against Hanover is really destined against East Friesland. 
</p><p>
On the second of this month the States General took the resolution that the act of guaranty of the Stadtholdership 
passed in the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a> should be immediately burnt. They ordered their agent van Hees to commit the instrument to 
the flames in their presence. He preferred asking his dismission from the office he sustained, and his request was 
immediately granted. They appointed in his stead a person who had been dismissed from the same station in 
consequence of the Revolution in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>. . . .
