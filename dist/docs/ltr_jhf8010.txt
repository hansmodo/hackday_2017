Sir : There is required for the support of the exploring party under my command, at present almost entirely destitute, the following amount of supplies with which I respectfully request that I may be furnished from the public stores. 
</p><p>
The unfriendly disposition of this Government in the present doubtful position of affairs, has made it very difficult for me to obtain provisions, in 
any case only to be had at very exorbitant prices; and to obtain them from our Squadron would materially aid the surveys with which I am charged and very much expedite my return to the States.
