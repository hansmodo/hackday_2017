MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOURS of November 12th is before me. I wish I could write you every day, more than once, for 
although I have a number of friends and many relations, who are very dear to me, yet all the friendship 
I have for others is far unequal to that which warms my heart for you. The most agreeable time that I 
spend here is in writing to you, and conversing with you, when I am alone. But the call of friendship 
and of private affection must give place to that of duty and honor. Even private friendship and affections require it. 
</p><p>
I am obliged, by the nature of the service I am in, to correspond with many gentlemen, both of the army 
and of the two houses of Assembly, which takes up much of my time. How I find time to write half the 
letters I do, I know not, for my whole time seems engrossed with business. The whole Congress is taken 
up, almost, in different committees, from seven to ten in the morning. From ten to four or sometimes five, 
we are in Congress, and from six to ten, in committees again. I Don't mention this to make you think me a 
man of importance, because it is not I alone," but the whole Congress is thus employed, but to apologize for not writing to you oAener. 
</p><p>
Indeed I know not what to write that is worth your reading. I send you the papers, which inform you of what is public. As to what passes in Congress, I 
am tied fast by my honor to communicate nothing. I hope the Journal of the Session will be published soon, and then you will see what we have been about 
in one view, excepting what ought to be excepted. If I could visit the coffee-houses in the evening, and the coffee-tables of the ladies in the afternoon, I could 
entertain you with mary smart remarks upon dress and air, &c., and give you many sprightly conversations, but my fate, you know, is to be moping over 
books and papers all the leisure time I have, when I have any. 
</p><p>
I hope I shall be excused from coming to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> again, at least until other gentlemen have taken 
their turns. But I never will come here again without you, if I can persuade you to come with me. Whom God has joined together ought not to be put asunder 
so long, with their own consent We will bring master Johnny with us ; you and he shall have the small 
pox here, and we will be as happy as Mr. Hancock and his lady. Thank Abby and John for their letters 
and kiss Charles and Tom for me. John writes like a hero, glowing with ardor for his country and burning with indignation against her enemies. 
</p><p>
As to coming home I have no thoughts of it ; shall stay here till the year is out, for what I know. Affairs are in a critical state, and important steps are 
now taking every day, so that I could not reconcile it to my own mind to be absent from this place at 
present. Nothing is expected from the Commissioners, yet we are waiting for them in some respects. The lories and timids pretend to expect great things 
from them. But the generality expect nothing but more insults and affronts. Privateering is licensed, and the ports are wide open. As soon as the resolves are printed, which will be to-morrow, I will send them.
