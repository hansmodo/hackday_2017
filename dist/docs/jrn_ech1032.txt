Last Sunday morning, Atkins, feeling very well, proposed a walk down to the city, not having been more than one hundred yards from our tent at any previous time. He has been ill ever since we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and has not yet stuck his spade into the ground. I hope he will soon be well, yet I hardly believe he will ever be able to work in the mines. I took him around and showed him the sights.

I have been dreadfully sick since last Sunday, being confined to my bed nearly all the time and taking quantities of medicine every day. The pain is almost exclusively confined to the head and right side of the face, the result of a slight cold, but if left to continue a few days without medical treatment it would have resulted in brain fever, I was informed. I am now, however, thank heaven, getting well pretty smart. I promised Cox's boys to work with them on a gulch tomorrow, but this evening I saw the doctor and he told me I had better remain idle a few days, for fear of bringing on the fever and ague. He gave me five pills to take before retiring.

I killed a snake in our tent, and the day previous I killed two very ugly wood lizards.
