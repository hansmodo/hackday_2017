My dear Sister
</p><p>
Your last very welcome letter came safe to hand and I am glad that you have succeeded in procuring a teacher and I hope that the children will learn well under his instruction. I am glad to hear of Mr. Arnold's improved health & trust that it may continue to improve. Through the blessing of out Heavenly Father we have been spared from the small pox thus far; & I hope that we may entirely escape it. There are but few cases now amongst the whites; the servants have taken it; though it has not spread much. As soon as a servant takes the disease he is carried to the hospital and they appear to be greatly afraid of the disease in consequence of their being sent to the hospital in case of taking it.

I hope that Anna's health is improving, but very little throws her back again. I wrote to Aunt Clem a few days since. On my return from Harper's Ferry, I came through Richmond & saw Wm. L. Jackson & his wife, Jonathan [Bennet, Burnet] & his wife and Wm. E. Arnold, Ben Bassett, John Hoffman & other friends. I wish you would write to me when are the given names of Wm. L. Jackson's wife & Bennett's wife & what relation there is between them & us, and give me a letter full of such things; as I am asked from time to time what is the Relationship me & such persons. I think Mr. Arnold knows a good deal about the subject. For example I think he knows what were grandfather's brothers. I remember having a talk with him once on the subject & I found that he appeared better acquainted with such things than myself. Who was Dr. Edward Jackson?

Anna joins me in love to you all. I hope that your health is better than when you last wrote.

Your affectionate brother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tjj" rel="me">Thomas</a>.
