SIR:
<p></p>
One portion of the American community has long 
attributed to you the most distinguished magnanimity, 
and the other portion the greatest desperation, in your 
resentments. Am I to conclude that both are in error? 
I allude to circumstances which have transpired be 
tween us, and which need not here be recapitulated, 
and to the fact that I have now been six days in your 
immediate vicinity without having attracted your notice. 
As this is the first time in my life that I have 
been within a hundred miles of you, and as it is barely 
possible that you may be ignorant of my presence, I 
beg leave to state that I shall not leave the District 
before the morning of the 14th inst. 
<p></p>
I have the honor to be, sir, 
<p></p>
Your most obedient servant, 
<p></p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="me">WINFIELD SCOTT</a> 
<p></p>
The HON. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague">GENERAL A. JACKSON</a>, Senator, etc.
