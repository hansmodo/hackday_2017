DEAR SIR, The inclosed letter has been just sent me by Miss 
Blttenhouse, and I avail myself of the delay of Mr. Morris to 
give it a conveyance. Since mine already in the hands of Mr. 
Morris, further returns have been received from the Western 
Counties of this State, which, though not the entire residue, 
reduce the final result to certainty. There will be seven representatives of the federal party, and one a moderate anti-federalist. I consider this choice as ensuring a majority of friends 
to the federal Constitution in both branches of the Congress; 
as securing the Constitution against the hazardous experiment 
of a second Convention; and, if prudence should be the character of the first Congress, as leading to measures which will conciliate the well meaning of all parties, and put our affairs into 
an auspicious train. 
</p><p>
I am charged by a Monsieur St. Trise, who is here, with his 
compliments to you. He is an officer in the French Cavalry, 
and appears to be an agreeable, worthy man. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of esteem and attachment, I am, dear 
sir, your friend and serv. 
</p>
