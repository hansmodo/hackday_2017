MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I AM so anxious for your health since you informed 
me of the return of your intermittent, that I shall 
take the stage on Monday for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, but whether 
I shall go by the packet to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, or continue in 
the stage to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I know not. This will depend 
upon the wind, and other circumstances to be learned 
at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>.

Colonel Smith is here in good health. He is re 
turned from France and England almost a revolutionist, 
if not quite. The fermentation in Europe distresses 
me, lest it should take a turn which may involve us 
in many difficulties. Our neutrality will be a very 
delicate thing to maintain, and I am not without ap 
prehension that Congress, at least the Senate, may be 
called together in the summer, if not earlier. How 
ever, we must be prepared as well as we can for 
events.

The Attorney General, in opening the information 
to the jury, at the trial of Mr. Paine, was pleased to 
quote large passages from Publicola, with some handsome compliments, so that Publicola is become a law authority. Mr. Erskine in his answer, cried, 
" Well, let others do like Publicola, answer the book, 
not prosecute the author."

I am weary of reading newspapers. The times 
are so full of events, the whole drama of the world 
is such a tragedy that I am weary of the spectacle. 
O ! my sweet little farm, what would I not give to en 
joy thee without interruption ! But I see no end to 
my servitude, however the nations of Europe, and 
even of Africa, may recover their liberty.

Hamilton has been sufficiently fatigued with demands for statements and information. I hope his 
health will hold out and his character be supported. 
But we have broad hints of what may be expected 
by executive officers who depend upon an elective 
head, from elective legislatures. Ambitious members of a legislature will too easily run down the popularity of ministers of state, or I am egregiously mis 
taken. But ga ira. France will soon show us examples enough of ministers falling before ambitious 
legislatures, if she has not exhibited enough already. Galon ne, Necker, Montmorin, and twenty others, 
where are they ?

I am, my dear, most tenderly, your
