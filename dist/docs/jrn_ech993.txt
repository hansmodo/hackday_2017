Yesterday when everything was ready for our departure, our new pumps were tried and to our great disappointment did not work and had to be taken ashore again. How long we may be delayed on this account we cannot tell.

Last evening a fracas took place on board between Messrs. H. and M. on account of the latter, with several others, accepting an invitation to a dinner on board another vessel with Mrs. H. Mr. H. took offence at this and attacked Mr. M., giving him a black eye and otherwise slightly hurting him. It was feared that this outbreak would lead to a general row and the signalthe American flag with a knot tied in itwas raised for interference of the men-of-war ships in port. We were soon boarded by several officers from the Chilian vessel and the parties carried on shore. After a hearing before the proper tribunal, they were dismissed.

Today eight of us caught, cleaned and salted a barrel of very fine fish which will last us once or twice a week until we reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Atkins and I, looking ahead, have provided ourselves for an emergency by laying in a lot of cheese and flour for our own consumption. Last evening they sent us but a small quantity for supper. We determined to have more, and proceeded forthwith to the galley. While one disputed
with the cook another stole a large basin full of stew off the stove, and we had a first-rate supper.

We have fifteen new passengers on boardFrenchmen who were bound for California. When their vessel stopped at Montevideo on the east of S. A., they resolved to cross the country and meet their vessel again at Valparaiso. In crossing the Andes they met with incredible hardships and were detained a long time, not reaching Valparaiso until after their vessel had arrived and after waiting some time for them, sailed, three days previous to their arrival, believing they had perished. This has offered an excellent opportunity for those who are desirous to learn to write and speak the French language, and a number of us have taken our first lesson.

It having been ascertained during the day that the Captain had not laid in a sufficient supply of good provisions to last us to California, a committee was appointed to wait for the Captain and express our dissatisfaction and wishes to him. A meeting was also held on the subject by the first cabin passengers. The Captain made us many fair promises on our voyage, to the effect that after reaching Valparaiso he would lay in a sufficient supply of good provisions for all, but these promises he has forgotten or at least not fulfilled. Although he has made considerable addition to the number of mouths, as we now have about 100 persons aboard, he has only about 800 pounds of flour to feed these for a period of sixty to ninety days, and other supplies are rated in the same meagre proportion. Much feeling exists on the subject and should our grievances go unredressed, disturbances may be expected before we reach our destination.

A fight occurred between Simpson and the doctor, the latter getting both eyes well blackened and his nose skinned.
