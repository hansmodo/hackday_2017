Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In mine of the ninth instant I mentioned to you&gt; that the 
enemy was in possession of Brussels, and so it was then asserted by authority, but it seems that he confined himself to Tongres and Liege, leaving the French army in possession of St Tron. At the same time it appears, that he was employed in 
pushing forward a column on his left, to turn their right flank, 
and had that movement been completed, the French army 
would, in all human probability, have been destroyed. To 
prevent the threatened danger, Miranda fell back to Lou vain, 
keeping open thereby the two roads to Antwerp and Brussels. 
</p><p>
As the enemy will doubtless endeavor to cut him off from 
the latter, I suppose that Dumouriez, relinquishing his expedition against the Netherlands, will form a junction with Miranda. In this case a battle must decide the fate of Flanders, 
and both parties will collect for the purpose all the force they 
can muster. I do not think the position taken at Louvain is 
tenable, because Brussels may be reached by the route of Namur, towards which the enemy will probably turn his 
attention in the first instance. 
</p><p>
Great exertions are making here to reinforce Dumouriez, 
and still greater to bring about a new revolution, whose effect, 
if successful, would be, I think, the destruction of what is called here the faction of the Gironde, and which calls itself the 
republican party, qualifying its enemies by the term Anarchists. To avoid if possible the carnage of the second to the 
eighth of last September, a tribunal, called the Revolutionary 
Tribunal, is organised, with very large and wide powers. It is 
one of those instruments whose operations are incalculable, 
and on whose direction depends the fate of the country. 
Opinion seems to set very strongly against the Convention. 
They are supposed to be incapable of steering the State ship 
in the present rough weather, but it must blow yet a little 
harder before they are thrown overboard. 
</p><p>
I believe I never mentioned to you that a constitution was 
reported ; but the truth is, that it totally escaped me. A 
paper of that sort was read at the Convention, but I learnt 
the next morning, that a council had been held on it over night, 
by which it was condemned ; so I thought no more of it, 
neither have I heard it mentioned until yesterday by one of 
my countrymen, which brought me to recollect that in my 
correspondence I had not noticed it. I am, with great respect 
and esteem, yours,
