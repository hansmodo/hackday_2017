<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>. The brand- new Confederacy is making or remodeling its Constitution. Everybody wants Mr. Dayis to be General-in-Chief or President. Keitt and Boyce and a party 
preferred Howell Cobb for President. And the fire-eaters per se wanted Barnwell Rhett.

My brother Stephen brought the officers of the " Montgomery Blues" to dinner. "Very soiled Blues", they said, 
apologizing for their rough condition. Poor fellows! they had been a month before Fort Dickens and not allowed to 
attack it. They said Colonel Chase built it, and so were sure it was impregnable. Colonel Lomax telegraphed to 
Governor Moore if he might try to take it, " Chase or no Chase," and got for his answer, " No." il And now," say 
the Blues, " we have worked like niggers, and when the fun and fighting begin, they send us home and put regulars there." They have an immense amount of powder. 
The wheel of the car in which it was carried took fire. There was an escape for yon! We are packing a hamper of eatables for them.

I am despondent once more. If I thought them in ear nest because at first they put their best in front, what now ? 
We have to meet tremendous odds by pluck, activity, zeal, dash, endurance of the toughest, military instinct. We 
have had to choose born leaders of men who could attract love and secure trust. Everywhere political intrigue is as 
rife as in Washington.

Cecil's saying of Sir Walter Raleigh that he could "toil terribly" was an electric touch. Above all, let the men who 
are to save South Carolina be young and vigorous. While I was reflecting on what kind of men we ought to choose, I 
fell on Clarendon, and it was easy to construct my man out of his portraits. What has been may be again, so the 
men need not be purely ideal types.

Mr. Toombs told us a story of <a href='/results.php?tla=wfs' rel=''>General Scott</a> and him self. He said he was dining in Washington with <a href='/results.php?tla=wfs' rel=''>Scott</a>, 
who seasoned every dish and every glass of wine with the eternal refrain, " Save the Union ; the Union must be preserved." Toombs remarked that he knew why the Union was so dear to the General, and illustrated his point by a 
steamboat anecdote, an explosion, of course. While the passengers were struggling in the water a woman ran up 
and down the bank crying, " Oh, save the red-headed man ! The red-headed man was saved, and his preserver, 
after landing him noticed with surprise how little interest in him the woman who had made such moving appeals seemed 
to feel. He asked her, " Why did you make that pathetic outcry? " She answered, Oh, he owes me ten thousand 
dollars." "Now, General," said Toombs, "the Union owes you seventeen thousand dollars a year ! : I can imagine the scorn on old <a href='/results.php?tla=wfs' rel=''>Scott's</a> face.
