DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The Fates have decreed that you shall receive no 
thing but disagreeable intelligence from this quarter. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>Major-General Greene</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>the Marquis</a> returned, the 
night before last, from the French Admiral. My letter, their entreaties, and <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s written remonstrance, drawn up on board the Languedoc, have 
only produced the letter which I inclose. It seems 
that the Captains of the French fleet are so incensed 
at the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>'s being put over them, he being but a land officer, that they are determined to 
prevent his doing any thing that may redound to his 
credit or our advantage. The Count himself wished 
to come in, but his Captains were, to a man, for leaving us. I then drew up a letter, in behalf of all the 
officers of the army, and sent on board ; but he, though 
the wind was not fair for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, put oil to sea night 
before last. This letter was followed by the inclosed 
protest, both of which I have ordered after him, in ;i 
fast-sailing privateer. I am, however, well persuaded 
that nothing will alter the determinations of the Captains, and that he will follow their counsel, though ho 
knows they wish his ruin. 
</p><p>
This sudden and unexampled procedure renders my 
situation exceeding delicate. The enemy have twice 
attempted to relieve the place by reinforcements ; the 
last fleet had four thousand troops on board. Should 
they make another attempt, they must succeed. They 
will then have near ten thousand troops on the Is 
land, and the command of the water on every side of us, as we have been obliged to dismantle our forts 
at Bristol and Tiverton to forward our operations 
against the town. 
</p><p>
I inclose to your Excellency a copy of the questions proposed by me to the General Officers and 
Commandants of brigades this day. I also inclose to 
your Excellency a copy of the protest sent after the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>. As my situation, at present, can 
promise nothing to advantage, except from a sudden 
attack, I wish the opinions of the officers may justify 
me in making this last effort. I have the honor to 
be, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">JOHN SULLIVAN</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I offered the Count, in my letter, to make 
the attack the moment he would land the troops, and 
put them in the boats I had prepared for them. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> and the Marquis assured him that 
we would not require the stay of his fleet and troops 
more than forty-eight hours. But nothing could induce him to assist us with either, a single moment.
