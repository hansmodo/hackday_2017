Brigadier-General Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire and Col. Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts called on me today and again after night, with both of whom I had much conversation in relation to the war. General Pierce expressed deep regret that General Benton had declined to accept the office of MajorGeneral, and said he had utterly ruined himself with the masses of the people of the country, at least such he thought was the public sentiment at the North. Col. Cushing concurred in this opinion. I think myself that General Benton will have reason to regret his course.
