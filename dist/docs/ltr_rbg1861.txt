I thank you My beloved brother for your most kind letter, which relieved me from much anxiety- I never for a moment 
doubted the good faith of your household- but was under the impression that Mrs S. had come to reside with you and 
feared you might experience difficulties & incur responsibilities which would interfere with the harmony so essential 
to domestic comfort- I trust dear Ann will pardon me if I give her a moments concern- my heart goes with her in the 
peculiar interest she has in this connection where her private feelings are so much in conflict with the condition we most 
approve and desire to accomplish- My love for Miriam & her children makes me realize all she suffers for those so near to 
her- we heard that Miriam was in Virginia on account of the illness of her son, whom they had taken home to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a> 
but what their present condition may be is yet to be determined- one of Gratz's sons is in Canada with Sara, sent there 
to keep him out of the way of mischief, but he seems tainted with the politicks of his father- Sara & her husband are truly 
loyal, tho' it seems the community in which they live is full of southern sympathisers and no doubt ready to adopt any 
English measures- I am rejoiced that Kentucky is ably supported and I hope will be safe through all coming time- I 
marvel at the apathy of our community- with the knowledge of Fleets of iron clad steamers preparing abroad which might 
enter our rivers and lay our cities in ashes no movement of defense is made. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Phila</a> is as full of idle people, the streets & 
shops crowded & except in the exorbitant prices asked for commodities & freely given the presence of war is unheeded- except indeed in the active works of charity for the sick & 
wounded brought to our hospitals. My Dear brother, I am too old to do any good, but feel deep interest in all this & 
pray for better times .... 
</p><p>
Give My love to your sons and their families- and believe me, ever dearest & beloved Ben your affectionate Sister
