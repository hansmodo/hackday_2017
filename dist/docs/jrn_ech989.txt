This has been the happiest day we have experienced for a long while. Early in the morning we came near the coast and continued close to it, until entering the Valparaiso harbor about 7 P.M. We were visited by the Custom House officers and soon afterward anchored, not being permitted to land until morning. We are all in high glee and excitement, and hence little inclination to writing. Tomorrow we will land and get the latest intelligence.
