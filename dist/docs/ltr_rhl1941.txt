MY DEAR FRIEND My feelings are not be described. I would go to every extremity to serve my friend, and the able friend of liberty and mankind. But here 
my power fails. I have not the smallest idea of personal danger, nor does this affect the present question. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear friend, may you be as happy as you deserve, then the cause of humanity will have nothing to fear for you.
