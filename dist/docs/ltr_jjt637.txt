My dear Colonel,
</p><p>
I have recommended Lt. Col. J. R. Jones late of the 33d Regt. Va. Vols. for a brigadier generalcy. I greatly need his services as such. Any thing you can do toward securing his appointment will be valuable service rendered to our cause. You may remember the part he bore in the capture of the arsenal at [Apalachica]. To him was entrusted the quelling of the insurrectionary movement in this District last spring and it was effected greatly to my satisfaction. Col. J. goes to Richmond at my request. My recommendation of him some time since was without his knowledge, and he is too modest a gentleman to do much in the way of pressing this matter as it affects him personally, and I therefore trust that this will do is for him. Please introduce him to Hon. A. R. Boteler, who has already taken steps toward securing the appointment.
</p><p>
Remember me very kindly to the Governor. Very truly your friend
