Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the first instant. Since that period another 
revolution has been effected in this city. It was bloody. 
Success, which always makes friends, gives to the present order 
an air of greater unanimity than really exists. A very considerable party is deeply interested to overturn it, but what 
may be their conduct is uncertain. Whether they will con 
fine themselves to idle vows and empty wishes, or whether 
they will break out into action, is doubtful. Some of them 
are men of enterprise, but it is rather .small than great enterprise. 
</p><p>
As you know well this kingdom, it may perhaps be 
sufficient to mention the kind of persons who compose this 
party. They are those who called themselves the moderate, 
or middle men, and who hoped to balance the two extremes, 
and govern the kingdom by playing off one set against the 
other. This, in quiet times, requires great talents, as well as 
great address, and they had more of the latter than the 
former. In times of turbulence it is necessary, that those who 
play this game should have a considerable armed force, 
because neither argument, nor persuasion, can then avail. It 
remains to be proved by the fact, whether they possess such 
force. If they do, it must be in the hands of M. de Lafayette ; 
and as all must depend on an immediate exercise of it, I 
rather think that the precious moment will be suffered to pass 
away. I have long been convinced that this middle party, 
who by the bye were the prime movers of the revolution, must 
fall to the ground, and that those who compose it must join 
one of the great factions. 
</p><p>
The Aristocratic faction is split into two or more. Some 
are for absolute monarchy, some for the ancient regime, some, 
and those but few, desire a mixed government. The framers 
of the late constitution had got up to this last ground, but the 
idea of a hereditary Senate stuck in their throats. The King. 
who has an uncommon firmness in suffering, but who has not 
the talents for action, and who is besides a very religious man,, 
found himself fettered by his oaths to the constitution, which 
he in his conscience believed to be a bad one ; and about 
which indeed there is now but one opinion in this country , 
because experience, that great parent of wisdom, has brought 
it already to trial and condemnation. The King, from the 
causes just mentioned, would not step forward, and of course 
there was no standard to which the adherents of the two 
chambers could repair. 
</p><p>
The republicans had the good sense to march boldly and 
openly to their object, and as they took care not to mince 
matters, nor embarrass themselves by legal or constitutional 
niceties, they had the advantage of union, concert, and design, 
against the disjointed members of a body without a head. If, 
under these circumstances, the foreign force were out of question, I should have no doubt that the republican form would 
take place quietly enough, and continue as long as the morals 
of the country would permit. You know the state of morals 
here, and can of course, if it be necessary, form the calculation 
for yourself. The circumstance of foreign force is however, 
on the present occasion, a preponderant object, and I think 
its effect will depend upon its activity. Should the Duke of 
Brunswick advance rapidly, he will be joined by great numbers, even of the armies opposed to him ; because the late 
change will furnish to some a reason, and to others a pretext, 
for abandoning the cause they had espoused. If, on the 
contrary, his progress be cautious and slow, it is probable that 
those who are now silent from fear, will habituate themselves 
by degrees to speak favorably of the present government, in 
order to lull suspicion : and that thus a public opinion will 
appear, which, when once pronounced, governs the generality 
of mankind. If by this means the new republic takes a little 
root, foreign powers will, I believe, find it a difficult matter to shake it to the ground, for the French nation is an immense 
mass, which it is not easy either to move or to oppose. 
You will observe, Sir, that matters are now brought to a 
simple question, between an absolute monarchy and a republic ; 
for all middle terms are done away. This question also must 
be decided by force, because on one side it is in the hands of the 
people, who cannot treat for themselves, and who will not permit others to treat for them in respect to the important interests which are now at stake. If, as in former times, some factious nobles were at the head of a party, they would, as formerly, take the first opportunity to stipulate for themselves at 
the expense of their party ; but without entering here into a 
question of relative integrity, I do not think the people are so 
attached to any particular men, as to have what may be called 
leaders ; and those who appear as such are in my opinion rather instruments than agents. 
</p><p>
I do not go into the history of things, nor trouble you with a 
recapitulation of events. I enclose, and shall send by the pre 
sent opportunity, the gazettes since my last, which will communicate all particulars, which you may desire to know. Since 
the operations of the tenth, the Logographe, Gazette Universelle, and Indicateur, are suppressed, as indeed were all those 
which were guilty of Feuillantisme, that is, adherence to the 
Club des Feuillants soi-disant Constitutionel. You must there 
fore make allowances for what you find in the other Gazettes, 
written not only in the spirit of a party, but under the eye of 
a party. The first must influence the most honest printer in 
the coloring of some facts, and the second will restrain the 
boldest printer in the publishing of other facts. If it were necessary, or could be useful, I should communicate all the particulars which come to my knowledge ; but this invidious task 
would answer no good end, and long before my letters could 
reach you, changes must inevitably take place. 
</p><p>
One particular however it is becoming to note. You will 
find that the Assembly immediately superseded the appointment of a Monsieur Bonne-Carrere, as minister to the United 
States. This man's character is as bad as need be, and stained 
by infamous vices. By what influence he was introduced into the office of Foreign Affairs I know not, for I was then in 
England ; but I have reason to believe it was the poor expedient of the Feuillants to watch, and check, and perhaps to be 
tray the Jacobin ministry. While the King was pressing M. 
Sainte-Croix (an eight day minister) to accept the department 
of Foreign Affairs, this last declared that he would not serve 
if Bonne-Carrere was retained ; and to get rid of him they in 
vented the expedient of sending him to America. I considered this step as a kind of insult, and transmitted my sentiments 
on the subject to the King, who thereupon told M. SainteCroix that I was angry at that appointment, and he must ar 
range the matter with me ; that he wished I would prevent 
his being received. 
</p><p>
The minister apologised for himself by saying the nomination had taken place before he came into office, and that he 
had remonstrated against it. He apologised for the thing as 
well as he could, admitting always that it was wrong ; and added that his embarkation should be delayed, and I was at liberty to prevent his being received. To this I replied, that he 
must not embark at all, but be removed ; and that would have 
been done, for when hs presented the Bon for his appointments, 
the minister refused to sign it. In the mean time the new revolution took place, and the history of M. Bonne-Carrere's ministry 
is at an end. It may perhaps be misrepresented, and therefore 
having stated the facts, I think it right to add that it proceeded from downright weakness. He was supposed to possess the 
confidence of a great many of the nobility, and therefore they 
were afraid to turn him about his business. Perhaps also he had 
been trusted so far that he knew too much. This was the 
case with some others, not better than him as to essentials, 
though not so much abased. 
</p><p>
I shall send herewith a packet, containing my correspondence with the Commissioners of the Treasury, relative to our 
debt, and in the same packet you will find a letter from Mr Cathalan to you relative to a riot at Marseilles, and his conduct 
therein. He has written two long letters to me on that subject, 
and I have replied by one of the thirteenth instant, which you 
will also find enclosed with his letter to you. 
</p><p>
I have already had occasion to mention to you, Sir, that I did 
not find myself authorised to go into the settlement of the 
account finally with the Commissioners of the Treasury. This 
observation I must again in this place repeat, and add that not 
withstanding my utmost efforts, I have not been able to bring 
the minister of Foreign Affairs to consider for a moment the 
question referred to me, respecting the sums paid and paying in 
America. What is still more surprising is, that the minister of 
the Marine, although authorised to treat with me for supplies to 
the colony of St Domingo, has done nothing in that affair. 
Two ministers have occupied that place since the decree. 
Each has given me various rendezvous, but neither has appeared at the time and place, because circumstances of the moment have obliged them to attend to something else. Indeed 
the executive of the late constitution has been at the last agony 
for these three months, and of course has thought more of saving its life than of doing its business. The present executive 
is just born, and may perhaps be stifled in the cradle. 
</p><p>
If a general arrangement could have been made with the 
late government, for paying the whole of the debt at some 
fixed exchange, so as to do justice, and fulfil the honorable 
intentions of the United States, I should have been well pleased, 
and although not exactly authorised should probably have taken 
on me to make the needful engagements ; and in so doing I 
should have made a great sacrifice to the public, because I wish 
of all things to be free from any pecuniary transactions, for I 
know by experience, that the utmost possible purity will not 
prevent malicious insinuations, which however unfounded will 
always find some believers. 
</p><p>
It appears, however, a probable event, that before our debt 
is paid, we may experience some considerable losses on ex 
change, not to mention the dead charges which are considerable too. It has therefore appeared to me most advisable to 
make one general statement and settlement of the whole ; and 
if it shall appear that we have gained, and that they have lo" 
by the modes of payment, then to give a good round sum as a 
compensation, and as it were gratuitously, because by that 
means we have the reputation of the good we do, and the sacrifice we make ; and because otherwise the agents of this government might attribute to their address an advantage gained, 
instead of giving credit to our generosity for a compensation 
granted. And it seems important to establish the latter idea, 
because it cannot fail to extend our credit throughout the world, 
and consequently to facilitate all pecuniary operations, which 
hereafter we may have occasion to make. 
</p><p>
Before I conclude this letter, permit me, my dear Sir, to 
request the orders of the President respecting my line of con 
duct in the circumstances about to arise. Perhaps these orders may not reach me, until the circumstances are past, but 
even then they may serve as a ground to reason on, in the circumstances which succeed. If they arrive in season, they will 
relieve my mind from a great weight. At present I feel my 
self in a state of contingent responsibility of the most delicate 
kind. I am far from wishing to avoid any fair and reasonable 
risk, and I rely on the justice of government, at the same 
time, to mark out as exactly as possible the conduct to be pur 
sued, as well as on its goodness to judge favorably of causes 
unforeseen. I am, &c.
