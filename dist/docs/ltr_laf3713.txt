My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
The embarkation, which I thought and do still 
think to have been destined to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, was reported to have sailed up the Bay, and to be bound 
to <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, in consequence of which, I wrote to 
your Excellency, and, as I had not indulged myself 
too near <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, I was able to cut across towards <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>. But, instead of continuing his 
voyage up the Bay, my Lord entered York River, 
and landed at York and Gloucester. To the former 
vessels were added a number of flat-bottomed boats. 
Our movements have not been precipitate. We were 
in time to take our course down Pamunky River, and 
will move to some position where the several parts of 
the army Vvill unite. 
</p><p>
I have some militia in Gloucester county, and some 
in York. We shall act agreeably to circumstances, 
but avoid drawing ourselves into a false movement, 
which, for want of cavalry and command of the rivers, would give the enemy the advantage of us. His 
Lordship plays so well, that no blunder can be hoped 
from him to recover a bad step of ours. The troops 
in York and Gloucester are, â€” two battalions of light infantry; two large Auspacli regiments, the eightieth 
and seventy-sixth, which are said to be the two largest ones in the British army; the forty-third, the 
Queen's rangers, and some horse. Lord Cornwallis 
himself commands. General O'Hara is in <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> 
with the remainder of the troops. Leslie is, it is 
said, gone in a frigate to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. You must not 
wonder, my dear General, that there has been a fluctuation in my intelligence. I am positive the British 
counsels have also been fluctuating. I am so earnest 
in my opinion, that I should not be surprised if the 
light infantry and Anspachers were detached to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
York is surrounded by the river and a morass. 
The entrance is but narrows There is, however, a 
commanding hill (at least I am so informed), which, 
if occupied by them, would much extend their works. 
Gloucester is a neck of land projected into the river, 
and opposite to York. Their vessels, the biggest of 
which is a forty-four, are between the two towns. 
Should a fleet come in at this moment, our affairs 
would take a very happy turn. 
</p><p>
General Gregory and Colonel Parker have been 
directed to collect forces, and press near <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
I have written to North Carolina to be guarded 
against any movement by land. I have written to Maryland for their new levies ; and, as agreeably to 
your intentions, his Lordship's remaining in the State 
keeps me with this army, I am still more anxious, 
if possible, to receive the private communications that 
have been announced. Had not your attention been 
turned to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, something, with a fleet, might 
be done in this quarter. But I see <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is 
the object, and consequently I attend to your instructions by Captain Olney. It is the more important for me to know what Lord Cornwallis ought to 
do for fulfilling your Excellency's wishes, as we 
might try to influence his Lordship's manoeuvres, and 
endeavour to determine them towards a wrong point. 
</p><p>
Vessels are gone back to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, it is thought, 
to fetch troops and cannon. Perhaps his Lordship 
does not choose to keep two distant posts. 
</p><p>
I beg, my dear General, you will forgive the more than usual scribbling of this hasty letter; and have the honor to be, with a respect equal to my affection, 
my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant and friend, 
</p><p>
