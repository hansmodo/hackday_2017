DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have just received the enclosed note from Mrs. McQueen, and have been talking with . It appears the enemy have it in contemplation to attack us in our divided state; they must inevitably ruin us. 
You will join the army, therefore, without loss of time. I wish it was possible for Gen. Marion to take a position near Monk's Corner, that he 
might join us in cases of necessity. Please to write to him on the subject. Let me hear from you to-night. I did not know until this morning that you had Major Moses command with you. I thought 
they had joined the line. 
</p><p>
Yours, &c.,
