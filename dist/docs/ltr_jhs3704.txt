My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my arrival at New Hampshire, I have been 
exercised with almost every perplexity, pain and trouble, that a shattered constitution could entail. During the course of the winter, and greater part of the 
spring and summer, I was scarce able to ride five 
miles; but, as the autumn begins to advance, I find 
my health gradually returning, and had thoughts of 
taking a ride to camp, in case I could have found 
cash enough in the State to defray my expenses. 
But, after repeated applications for a sum voted me 
by Congress in the month of September, <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>, I am 
at length informed (trifling as the sum is) that the 
money is not in the Treasury of the State, and no 
immediate prospect of matters being in a better situation. In this case, I would beg your Excellency's 
advice. Money I have none, and my private fortune 
scarce competent to the support of a numerous offspring, which Heaven has been pleased to bestow. 
Congress undoubtedly expected that the State would 
pay me what they voted, and the requisition the 
General Assembly agreed to accept ; but the Treasury 
is empty, and no money in the State to replenish it. 
However, should your Excellency think my presence 
at any place in the army necessary for the good of 
my country, I will endeavour, upon the shortest notice, 
to prepare myself to comply with your commands.

This State has exceeded all expectations in raising 
their recruits ; yet there is still a number deficient, 
which probably may not be got very soon. And, 
indeed, it is not surprising that the affairs of this 
State should be very irregular, during its present 
complicated, unsettled form of government. 
</p><p>
The General Assembly, sensible of the impracticability of paying the tax for this year in cash, have 
resolved the same be paid in the different species 
of the produce of the country; in consequence of 
which, a considerable number of beef-cattle has been collected, and many more will no doubt be soon raised, for the use of the army. 
</p><p>
Most sincerely wishing you success, that your path 
on the theatre of glory may still continue to shine 
with its usual splendor, and that you may soon be 
able to restore to your country a safe, honorable, 
and lasting tranquillity, is the ardent desire of your 
most obedient, 
</p><p>
Most devoted, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
