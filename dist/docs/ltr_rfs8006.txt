Sir : I have the honor to inform you that the civil government of this Territory is in successful operation, that <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Colonel Fremont</a> is acting as 
governor, and Colonel Russell as secretary, and that I am on board of the Congress preparing her for the coast of Mexico. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant Gray, who is charged with my despatches, has been my aid-de-camp, and has done his duty with great good conduct and gallantry. 
He is the officer whom I sent to relieve <a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="colleague">General Kearny</a> from his perilous condition after his defeat at San Pasqual, and deserves the consideration of the department. 
</p><p>
He will be able to give you the particulars of that unfortunate and disastrous affair. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="me">R. F. Stockton</a>, 
</p><p>
Commodore, etc. 
</p><p>
To the Honorable George Bancroft, 
</p><p>
Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. C.
