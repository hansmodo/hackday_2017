My dear Sister
</p><p>
I intended writing to you to day but as Anna has done so, I will only say a few words & these with respect to Grace. I have not mentioned the subject to Maj. Preston, and I don't think it necessary to consult him upon the subject, but if you still desire me to do so, let me know in your next letter and I will give you his opinion.
</p><p>
My mind is clear in favor of making Grace familiar with the English Grammar as soon as practicable; let her commence it at once. Let her not only study the principles of the language, but require her to parse a great deal, so as to make her familiar with the application of the principles of the language. Let all her studies be English until she shall become a finished English scholar. I don't attach much importance to Latin for females. It is of value to every educated person, but mostly to professional men. I am glad that Mr. A. is retaining Mr. McCutchin. You may expect another line from me in a week or so.

Your affec. Brother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjt" rel="me">Thomas</a>.

P.S.   Maj. J. requests me to say to you that he will attend to any commissions for furniture in the month that you may wish.- as ever yours, Anna.
