Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
Two matters now excite attention among politicians. 
What is the cause and what will be the effect of the 
recent elections, and what are we to do about our depreciated paper money. No doubt many causes conspire to 
defeat the Union parties. The two I will name were 
the most influential, and yet the least will be said about 
them. 
</p><p>
The first is, that the Republican organization was 
voluntarily abandoned by the President and his leading 
followers, and a no-party Union was formed to run 
against an old, well-drilled party organization. This 
was simply ridiculous. It was as if you should disband 
your army organization because it was tyrannical, and 
substitute the temporary enthusiasm of masses to fight 
regular armies. Political as well as military organization is necessary to success. Ward meetings, committees, conventions, party cries are just as necessary in 
politics, as drills, reviews, &c., are in war, so the Republicans have found out. If they have the wisdom to 
throw overboard the old debris that joined them in the 
Union movement, they will succeed. If not, they are 
doomed. 
</p><p>
The other prominent reason for defeat is, the people 
were dissatisfied at the conduct and results of the war. 
The slow movements on the Potomac and worse still in 
Kentucky dissatisfied and discouraged people. It was 
a little singular that the Democrats, some of whom 
opposed the war, should reap the benefit of this feeling, 
bnt such is the fate of parties. Lincoln was a Republican. He put and kept in these slow generals and we 
shall be punished for it by having an organized opposition 
limiting appropriations. No doubt the wanton and unnecessary use of the power to arrest without trial and 
the ill-timed proclamation contributed to the general 
result. The other matter I allude to is demanding 
careful consideration. As it is my line of official duty, 
I have formed certain theories which may be all wrong ; 
but as they are the result of reflection, I will act upon 
them. My remedy for paper money is, by taxation, to 
destroy the banks and confine the issue to Government 
paper. Let this only issue, as it is found to be difficult 
to negotiate the bonds of the government. As a matter 
of course there will a time come when this or any scheme 
of paper money will lead to bankruptcy, but that is the 
result of war and not of any particular plan of finance. 
I watch your course closely and take great interest and 
pride in your success. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother,
