DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favour of March 13th, and am extremely 
concerned at the disorders on our frontiers, and at the debility 
or wicked connivance of our government and magistrates, 
which must make property and even life more and more 
insecure among us, if some effectual remedy is not speedily 
applied. I have laid all the accounts before the ministry 
here. I wish I could procure more attention to them. I 
have urged over and over the necessity of the change we 
desire ; but this country itself being at present in a situation 
very little better, weakens our argument that a royal government would be better managed, and safer to live under, 
than that of a proprietary. Even this capitol, the residence 
of the King, is now a daily scene of lawless riot and confusion. 
Mobs patrolling the streets at noonday, some knocking all 
down that will not roar for Wilkes and liberty; courts of 
justice afraid to give judgment against him; coal-heavers 
and porters pulling down the houses of coal merchants, that 
refuse to give them more wages; sawyers destroying sawmills; sailors unrigging all the outward bound ships, and 
suffering none to sail till merchants agree to raise their pay ; 
watermen destroying private boats and threatening bridges; 
soldiers firing among the mobs and killing men, women, and 
children, which seems only to have produced a universal 
sullenness, that looks like a great black cloud coming on, 
ready to burst in a general tempest. 
</p><p>
What the event will be God only knows. But some 
punishment seems preparing for a people, who are ungratefully abusing the best constitution, and the best King, any 
nation was ever blessed with, intent on nothing but luxury, 
licentiousness, power, places, pensions, and plunder ; while 
the ministry, divided in their counsels, with little regard for 
each other, worried by perpetual oppositions, in continual 
apprehension of changes, intent on securing popularity in 
case they should lose favour, have for some years past had 
little time or inclination to attend to our small affairs, whose 
remoteness makes them appear still smaller. 
</p><p>
The bishops here are very desirous of securing the Church 
of England in America, and promoting its interest and enlargement by sending one of their order thither ; but though 
they have long solicited this point with government here, 
they have not as yet been able to obtain it ; so apprehensive 
are ministers of engaging in any novel measure. 
</p><p>
I hope soon to have an opportunity of conferring with 
you, and therefore say no more at present on this subject. 
I am, my dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
