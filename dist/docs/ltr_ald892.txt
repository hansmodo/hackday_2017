DEAR Free Trader --I left my comfortable quarters, where I had stopped to recruit and dose off the chills, this morning and came here to join our company. They have been encamped on the opposite side of the river in Indian Territory several days, but as the grass is good out at least fifteen miles, they have broken up camp and have determined to move as far as grass will allow. I shall cross after dinner and overtake them. We shall then be beyond any regular public conveyance--shall have to depend entirely upon chance. I shall embrace any which may occur to continue my correspondence. I am happy to say that my health is re-established. I learn that all our company are well. We do not go to Fort Kearny, but strike for Grand Island on the Platte. And now commence our wanderings, and whether they will continue as long and be as varied as those of the children of Israel, remains to be seen. I fear, however, that one of their evil deeds will be in some measure imitated by us; that is, the worship of the "Golden Calf." May we not forget, however, that there is a God in Israel. This is sixty miles above St. Joseph.
</p><p>
Truly yours,
</p>
