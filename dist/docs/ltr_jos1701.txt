UNITED STATES SENATE,

Dear Brother: . . . You are probably right in your 
treatment of the Presidential nomination. Most of the 
talk in your favor is no doubt honest and sincere, but 
some of it, I am sure, is to crowd off other candidates, 
or for selfish motives. A nomination is far from being 
equivalent to an election. The chances are for the 
Democrats, but for their proverbial blundering. An 
election would be a misfortune to you, while the canvass 
would be painful to all the family. Still, having fairly 
and fully stated your opposition to being a candidate, 
and having given fair notice of your purpose to decline, 
it is better not to say anything more about it. The 
papers will think you protest too much.

It now looks as if Logan may get the nomination. 
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jos" rel="me">John Sherman</a>.
