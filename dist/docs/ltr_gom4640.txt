Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my last, I have had every reason to believe, that the 
execution of the King has produced on foreign nations the 
effect which I had imagined. The war with England exists, and it is now proper, perhaps, to consider its consequences, to 
which effect, we must examine the objects likely to be pursued by England, for in this country, notwithstanding the gasconades, a defensive war is prescribed by necessity. 
</p><p>
Many suppose that the French Colonies will be attacked, 
but this I do not believe. It is indeed far from improbable 
that a British garrison may be thrown into Martinique, but as 
to St Domingo, it would require more men than can be spared 
to defend it, and as much money as it is worth. Besides 
which, there are higher considerations to be attended to. 
In one shape or another, this nation will make a bankruptcy. 
The mode now talked of, is to pay off the debt in a species of 
paper money, which shall be receivable for the sales of confiscated property, and which shall bear no interest. When once 
the whole of the debt shall be fairly afloat, the single word depreciation will settle all accounts. You will say, perhaps, that 
this measure is unjust, but to this I answer, that in popular governments, strongly convulsed, it is a sufficient answer to all arguments, that the measure proposed is for the public good. 
Supposing, then, the debt of France thus liquidated, she presents a rich surface covered with above twenty millions of people, who love war better than labor. Be the form of government what it may, the Administration will find war abroad 
necessary to preserve peace at home. The neighbors of 
France must therefore consider her as a great power, essentially belligerent, and they must measure themselves by the scale 
of her force. 
</p><p>
In this view of the subject, to take her islands, is to possess 
but the paring of her nails, and therefore more serious efforts 
must be made. Strange as it may seem, the present war is, 
on the part of France, a war of empire, and if she defends 
herself, she commands the world. I am persuaded that her 
enemies consider this as the real state of things, and will there 
fore bend their efforts towards a. reduction of her power; and 
this may be compassed in two ways, either by obliging her to 
assume a new burden of debt to defray the expense they are 
at on her account, or else by a dismemberment. The latter 
appears the more certain mode. In this case, it will, I presume, be attempted to make the Saome her northern boundary 
as far as the Ardennes, and then along the Ardennes to the 
Vosges mountains, to mount Jura, and along mount Jura to the 
Alps. This will throw French Flanders, Artois, and a part of 
Picardy into the circle of Austrian Flanders, which may be 
erected into an independent State, and the country lying east 
of the Vosges and mount Jura may be a compensation to the 
Elector Palatine, for the cession of Bavaria. 
</p><p>
On such a project, if it exists, the first question is as to the 
means of execution ; and these are well prepared, if the enemy knows how to make use of them. Alsace is attached to 
the German Empire, and to the cause of religion. The only 
thing, which pleases them in the revolution, is the abolition of 
the tithes, and they are as much disgusted by the banishment 
of their priests. I speak here of the Roman Catholic only. 
The sentiments of this people cannot be unknown to the enemy. As to French Flanders and Artois, the cause of religion 
is with them the first care, but as yet they have not had a fair 
opportunity to show themselves, because they are awed by the 
numerous garrisons spread through their country. I think, as 
I mentioned in my last, that there exists a treaty respecting 
Flanders between England and Austria, but I cannot find out 
the exact purport. Prussia is, I think, to find her account in 
Poland. 
</p><p>
As to the conduct of the war, I believe it to be on the part 
of the enemy as follows. First, the maritime powers will try to 
cut off all supplies of provisions, and take France by famine ; 
that is to say, excite revolt among the people by that strong 
lever. Give us again our bread and our chains, might perhaps 
be the language of Paris. I think I can perceive some seeds 
already sown to produce that fruit. It is not improbable, that 
our vessels bringing provisions to France may be captured and 
taken into England, the cargoes paid for by the government. 
Secondly, Britain may perhaps land a body of troops in Normandy, with intention to prenetrate to Rouen, and cause the 
royal standard to be erected by the French Emigrants. If a 
large body of the people flock to it, they might come on to 
wards the capital, if not, they may move along the coast to 
Abbeville, and thence form a junction with the army acting in 
Flanders. For this descent, if it takes place, is but a secondary operation ; the main stress will be in Flanders, for there 
the troops of Britain, Holland, Hanover, Austria, and Prussia, 
can be fed from the ocean at a very cheap rate, and the more 
their operations may be confined to the sea coast, the more will 
it be difficult for France to oppose them, because the provisions 
must in such case be carried to an extreme corner of the country. Thirdly, an attack of great energy will be made on the 
side of Mayence, in the view to destroy totally the army under 
Custine, and penetrate into lower Alsace. But the real at 
tack of that ci-divant province will, I think, be on the side of 
Upper Alsace, for which purpose nothing will be left undone 
to bring the Swiss into action, as thereby the fire of war will 
extend all along from the German Ocean to the Mediterranean 
Sea. Fourthly, the efforts on the side of Savoy will probably be confined to the recovery of that country, and such di 
version as may occupy a part of the French army for their own 
defence. Fifthly, on the side of Provence and Languedoc 
there will be only a predatory war, a war of alarm, such as 
may increase the want of bread by multiplying the consumers, for I do not believe in a serious attempt on either Toulon 
or Marseilles. Under this chapter, and as an incidental consideration, are the intrigues with the Turk to engage the Barbary powers. I think a British squadron in the Mediterranean will do more towards these than a dozen Ambassadors. 
Lastly, on the side of Spain there will, I believe, be nothing 
more than diversion. How great that may be will depend on 
contingencies, not within the compass of human foresight. A 
revolution at court which should dismiss the Queen and her 
paramour might give some energy to the administration,, 
which at present is extremely feeble. 
</p><p>
Having thus run through the probabilities on the side of the Adversary, I come now to what appear to be the views of 
France. You will have seen, that the effective army for <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a> 
is fixed at something more than five hundred thousand men. 
These they will be able to get together. The recruiting service goes on well, and although many of the last year's men 
return with design not to re-engage, their places will be sup 
plied ; so that by the beginning of June that immense army 
(barring accidents) will be completed. 
</p><p>
The main object at present is to overrun Holland ; a thing 
which might have been affected six weeks ago, but at present 
I believe it is not to be done. If the Prussian aud Hanoverian troops advance rapidly, it will hardly be attempted. It is 
however expected that Maestricht may fall as suddenly as Mayence, and perhaps by similar means. If this should happen 
it would greatly impede the confederates, and of course they 
will exert themselves to prevent that misfortune. Never 
were the moments more precious, than they are to both par 
ties in that quarter ; for there the first blow will be more than 
one half of the battle. Should the enemy become speedily 
superior in the field, there is nothing to stop him till he comes 
to Valenciennes, and at every step he would gather new force ; 
besides, he need not embarrass himself with convoys, because 
he would soon receive abundance from the side of the sea. 
As to the colonies, I believe that France will not attempt to 
defend them, and their whole commerce falls naturally into 
the lap of America, unless the British prevent it, and I think 
they will find it more convenient to neglect that small object 
to pursue the great ones, which open themselves to view in 
this quarter. 
</p><p>
What I have just said leads me very naturally to your letter of the seventeenth of November. You had previously instructed me to endeavor to transfer the negotiation for a 
new treaty to America, and if the revolution of the tenth of 
August had not taken place, but instead thereof the needful 
power and confidence been restored to the crown, I should perhaps have obtained what you wished as a mark of favor and confidence. A change of circumstances rendered it necessary to change entirely my conduct, so as to produce in 
one way, what was impracticable in another. 
</p><p>
As I saw clearly, or at least thought I saw, that France and 
England would at length get by the ears, it seemed best to let 
them alone, until they should be nearly pitted. When I found 
this to be the case, I asked an interview with the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, and mentioned to him my wish that an exception should be made in the decree against emigrants, in favor 
of those who were in the United States. I told him truly, that 
I wished the alliance between the two nations to be strictly pre 
served. I told him with great frankness, that notwithstanding 
appearances, and the flattering accounts transmitted by some 
of his agents, Britain was, in my opinion, hostile, and an at 
tempt at alliance with her, idle. He assured me he was of the 
same opinion. I then observed to him, that in such case, 
there would be no doubt but Mr Hammond would exert him 
self to inculcate the opinion, that our treaty having been made 
with the King, was void by the Revolution. He said that such 
an opinion was absurd. I told him, (premising in this place, 
that the whole conversation was inofficial, and unauthorised on 
my part, from circumstances he was well acquainted with,) that 
my private sentiments were similar to his, but I thought it 
would be well to evince a degree of good will to America, 
which might prevent disagreeable impressions, and had there 
fore taken the liberty to suggest the exception in favor of emigrants to America. 
</p><p>
Here I left it, and changed the conversation. Now I know 
well, that some of the leaders here who are in the Diplomatic 
Committee hate me cordially, though it would puzzle them to 
say why ; and I was determined rather to turn that disposition 
to account than to change it, because I see some advantages to 
result from it. Thus I contributed indirectly to the slight put 
on me, by sending out M. Genet without mentioning to me a 
syllable either of his mission or his errand, both of which, 
nevertheless, I was early and sufficiently informed of. The 
pompousness of this Embassy could not but excite the attention of England, and my continuance at Paris, notwithstanding 
the many reasons which might have induced me to leave it&gt; 
would also, I thought, excite in some degree their jealousy ; and 
I have good reason to believe that this effect was produced. 
From all this I conjectured, that both parties might be brought 
to bid at your auction, At any rate the thing you wished for 
is done, and you can treat in America if you please. Whether 
you will or not is another affair. Perhaps you will see that 
all the advantages desired do already exist, that the acts of the 
constitutional Assembly have in some measure set us free from 
our engagements, and that, increasing daily in power, we may 
make quite as good a bargain some time hence as now. 
</p><p>
It remains to add a few words in reply to what regards me 
personally in your letter. I am very happy, indeed, to find 
that my conduct, as far as it was known, is approved of. This 
is the summit of my wish, for I. candidly acknowledge that the 
good opinion of the wise and virtuous is what I prize beyond 
all earthly possessions, I have lately debated much within 
myself what to do. The path of life in Paris is no longer 
strewed with roses, as you may well imagine ; indeed it is extremely painful. I have already given my reasons for staying 
here, but now the scene is changed, and I had thoughts of 
making a tour to the different Consulates. There are, how 
ever, some pretty solid objections to that plan for the present. 
</p><p>
The next thing which suggested itself was to hire a country 
house for the summer season, in the neighborhood. At length, 
that my leaving the city might give no offence to anybody, I 
have bought a country house in an out of the way place, 
where it is not likely that any armies will pass or repass, even 
should the enemy penetrate. If I lose the money paid for it, 
I will put up with the loss. The act in itself shows a disposition friendly to France, and as it is between twenty and thirty 
miles from Paris, I shall be at hand, should business require 
my presence. Mr Livingston, my secretary, will continue 
in town unless driven out of it by war or famine. In this way 
I hope to avoid those accidents which are almost inseparable 
from the present state of society and government, and which, 
should they light on the head of a public Minister, might involve consequences of a disagreeable nature. It is more pro 
per also, I conceive, to make arrangements of this kind in a 
moment of tranquillity, than when confusion is awakened in 
to mischief. In all this my judgment may err, but I can tru jly say that the interest of the United States is my sole object. 
Time alone can tell whether the conduct be as right as I 
know the intention to be. 
</p><p>
Before I close this letter, I must pray your indulgence for 
referring to the enclosed copy of what I wrote on the twenty-^ 
seventh of last month, to the bankers of the United States in 
Amsterdam. I make no comment thereon, only as I had no 
right to give the order in question, I consider it as of course, 
that if disapproved of I must replace the money which may be 
advanced on it. This is one of the cases in which not to act 
is taking a part, and in which it is ruin to balance.
