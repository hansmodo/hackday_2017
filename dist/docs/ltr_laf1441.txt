At the entrance of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> harbour, April 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>.
</p><p>
Here I am, my dear general, and, in the midst of the joy I feel in
finding myself again one of your loving soldiers, I take but the time
to tell you that I came from France on board a frigate which the king
gave me for my passage. I have affairs of the utmost importance which I
should at first communicate to you alone. In case my letter finds you
anywhere this side of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I beg you will wait for me, and do
assure you a great public good may be derived from it.
</p><p>
To-morrow we go up to the town, and the day after I shall set off in my
usual way to joined my beloved and respected friend and general.
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear general; you will easily know the hand of your young
soldier.
</p><p>
My compliments to the family.
