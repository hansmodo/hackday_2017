I am sure my honored Mother must be anxious to know the event of 
yesterday's cannonade. I therefore take the earliest opportunity of 
acquainting her with the particulars of it. As my station was at Fort 
Johnston, and the whole of the engagement was at Sullivan's Island, I 
was only a spectator, though I and every man here declared they longed 
earnestly to have been there, to have partaken the honor and danger 
with their fellow soldiers. 
</p><p>
Yesterday, about eleven o clock, the Bomb Ketch, and a ship-of-war, 
came up from Five-Fathom Hole, and a signal was fired from the Commodore for the other ships of war to weigh anchor. At about half 
after eleven, the Ketch began to favor Sullivan's Island with some 
bombs. I could distinctly see many of them burst in the air. Five fell in the Fort at Sullivan's Island, but did no other damage than slightly wounding one man. The Solebay, of 28 guns, who was ahead 
of the line, received a shot from the Island, and immediately returned 
it with her whole broadside. The enemy then formed in two lines to 
attack the Fort on Sullivan's Island. In the first line the Bristol, of 
50 guns, the Solebay, of 28, the Active, of 28, and a 40 gun vessel, 
which I am told is called the Roebuck, (I am not sure of her name, 
but certain of her strength, for I could plainly see her guns.) In the 
second line was the Syren, of 28, and two other frigates, whose names 
I do not know ; behind them were the Bomb Ketch, and a heavy hulk 
of a vessel something like our Prosper. 
</p><p>
A brisk and heavy cannonading was kept up at first, both from the 
ships and the Fort. Some shot from the Fort put their second line into 
disorder, and carried away the bowsprit of one of the frigates; and as they 
were near that bank of sand which runs out from the Fort towards Sullivan's Island, and then turns towards Cummins Point (called the Lower 
Middle), the two ships, whose names I do not know, ran aground there. 
The first line of the enemy appeared to us at this place to be about six 
or seven hundred yards from the Island, but from them I hear they were 
within 500 yards. All the 26 pounders were pointed at the Bristol, 
and about two hours after the cannonading began, she received so much 
damage that she was obliged to draw back, but still continued to fire, 
though not so briskly as before. At about three o clock the Fort had 
expended all its ammunition, (it had thirty odd rounds to each gun, and 
thirty-two guns.) The shipping still kept up a heavy cannonade; the 
Fort could not return it. In about two hours they got a supply of 200 lbs. of gunpowder from Tufts , and 500 lbs. from Hacldrell's Point. 
They fired again, but slowly, and with great judgment. Night came 
on, and the cannonading still continued on both sides, and the greatest 
number of our shot (if we may judge from the noise they made against 
the sides of the ships) took place, but the ships fired near fifty for one. 
A little after nine o clock, the ships thought they were sufficiently 
battered, and ceased firing; and half after nine began to work down 
again to their old station in Five-Fathom Hole. One of the ships which 
ran aground got off again, the other (at least a twenty-gun ship) stuck 
fast there. Upon being fired at from the Island this morning, she re 
turned the fire ; the Island fired again. The men then that were on 
board her loaded all their guns, set her on fire, got into her boats, leaving all the colors flying aboard the ship, and rowed off to the rest of the 
fleet. When she burnt down to her cannon, she gave a noble discharge. 
A boat from the Island went on board of her, and brought away her 
Jack. She is now almost burnt down to the water's edge; in a little 
while we shall scarcely see the remains of her. The ships that warped 
off must have received considerable damage, as in general the shot from 
the Island was exceedingly well placed. The Bristol's mizen mast is this 
moment fallen down, doubtless in consequence of the shot she got yesterday. Several parts of the ships, and some parts of the cabin, have 
floated up to town, so that I believe they have met with a reception 
they little expected. The officers and men at the Island I am informed, 
behaved with the greatest bravery; and notwithstanding so heavy a 
cannonade for ten hours, we had but ten men killed and twenty-two 
wounded. There were only Moultrie's Regiment, consisting of about 
350 men, and thirty of Roberts Artillery, in the Fort. The officers 
behaved nobly, and pointed every gun themselves ; and what is remark 
able, though there was not a man killed but what was close to an officer, 
yet only Lieut. Gray was slightly wounded by a splinter from a carriage 
in his thigh, and a spent ball on his breast. Lieuts. Hall and Mazyck 
received two contusions in their faces. The first man that was killed 
was a Corporal of Grenadiers. The rest of the men who belonged to 
his gun immediately threw him off the platform with their handspikes, 
crying out, u Revenge, let us revenge our comrade's death ! 7 and immediately returned to their gun with the greatest eagerness. 
</p><p>
The enemy shot away the flag -staff, with our colors. A grenadier 
immediately ran through a shower of grape shot, and stuck up the 
colors on a pike. One McDonald, a sergeant in Capt. Frank Huger's 
Company, being mortally wounded, as they were carrying him away, 
cried out, " I am killed my brethren, but don t let liberty expire with 
me !" While this happened at the end of Sullivan's Island, where this 
Fort is, the enemy, whose troops are on Long Island, attempted to pass 
over to that end of Sullivan's Island which was nearest them, but received so warm a reception from Thompson's Rangers, the Virginia 
Riflemen, some of the North Carolina troops, a few of the Militia, and 
an eighteen pounder that we had there, that they were obliged to re 
treat, without wounding so much as one of our men. The enemy's 
loss in men must have been considerable, as our shots were chiefly levelled at the hull of the ships. The transports lay in Five-Fathom 
Hole during the whole engagement. I assure you I never saw men in 
higher spirits than ours were during the whole cannonade; and though 
from our station here we were unfortunate enough to be out of it, there 
was not a man but was wishing most earnestly to be there. 
</p><p>
The Fort, though well peppered with shot, has received scarcely any 
damage, not a single breach being made in it, nor did the Palmetto 
logs, of which it is built, at all splinter. The powder room on board 
the burning frigate, has this instant blown up. You cannot conceive 
what a noble column of smoke it makes till it loses itself among the highest clouds. 
</p><p>
My brother is well. Pray give my love to my sister and Dan, and 
compliments to Mrs. Elliott, and the ladies at Sandy Hill. I remain, 
Your dutiful son,
