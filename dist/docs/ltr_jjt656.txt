My dear sister,
</p><p>
I am very much pressed with business, but I must drop you a line to say that yesterday God blessed us with a charming little daughter, and we have named her after Mrs. Morrison, Mary Graham.
</p><p>
My eyes have been troubling me much lately. I regret that you have had so much suffering, it appears to have resembled my attack. I am now using glycerine which is the essence of oil. I take it through the nostrils for the purpose of curing the inflammation at the entrance of the nasal tubes into the mouth and I find it of great service. God had blest its use to me very much. I tried caustic or nitrate of silver, but with much less effect. I hope that you will soon be well. I ascertained to day that I can get a copy of "Silver Wood" in town so you may expect one when Mr. Chenoweth goes home if not before.
</p><p>
Anna & the little one are both doing very well for which we are thankful to our Heavenly Father. I received a letter from Wirt a few days since. His health I think is just tolerable from what he says. I have been wanting to write to Thomas for some time & and hope to do so before long.
</p><p>
May the blessings of our Heavenly Father rest upon you richly is the prayer of your affectionate brother. Anna joins me in love to you & the children. Remember me very kindly to Mr. Arnold.
</p><p>
Your brother,<br/>
