TO COL. JAMES MADISON. 
</p><p>
November 24th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1786">1786</a>. 
</p><p>
HON D Sm, The House of Delegates have just passed a bill 
making Tobacco receivable in the tax at the market price at 
the several Warehouses to be fixt by the Executive. There is 
a proviso that the highest price shall not exceed 28s. An 
equality of price throughout was contended for, which I disapproved: 1. Because I think it would have been unjust. 2. 
Because the bill could not have been carried in that form. I 
was not anxious for its success in any form, but acquiesced in 
it as it stands, as the people may consider it in the light of an 
easement, and as it may prevent some worse project in the 
Assembly. 
</p><p>
[The following Petition for the repeal of the Law incorporating the Protestant 
Episcopal Church in Virginia, passed in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1784">1784</a>, is found among the papers of Mr. 
Madison, and in his handwriting.*] 
</p><p>
To Hue, Honorable tJie Speaker and gentlemen the General Assembly of Virginia : 
</p><p>
We, the subscribers, members of the Protestant Episcopal 
Church, claim the attention of your honorable body to our 
objections to the law passed at the last session of Assembly 
for incorporating the Protestant Episcopal Church; and we 
remonstrate against the said law 
</p><p>
Because the law admits the power of the Legislative Body 
to interfere in matters of Religion, which we think is not 
included in their jurisdiction: 
</p><p>
Because the law was passed on the petition of some of the 
clergy of the Protestant Episcopal Church, without any application from the other members of that church on whom the law 
is to operate ; and we conceive it to be highly improper that 
the Legislature should regard as the sense of the whole church 
the opinion of a few interested members, who were in most 
instances originally imposed on the people without their consent, and who were not authorized by even the smallest part of 
this community to make such a proposition: 
</p><p>
Because the law constitutes the clergy members of a convention who are to legislate for the laity, contrary to their fundamental right in chusing their own Legislators: 
</p><p>
Because by that law the most obnoxious and unworthy Clergyman cannot be removed from a parish except by the determination of a body, one half of whom the people have no 
confidence in, and who will always have the same interest with the 
Minister whose conduct they are to judge of: 
</p><p>
Because by that law power is given to the Convention to 
regulate matters of faith, and the obsequious vestries are to 
engage to change their opinions as often as the Convention 
shall alter theirs: 
</p><p>
Because a system so absurd and serv.e will drive the members of the Episcopal church over to other sects, where there 
will be more consistency and liberty: 
</p><p>
We therefore hope that the wisdom and impartiality of the 
present Assembly will incline them to repeal a law so pregnant 
with mischief and injustice. 
</p><p>
