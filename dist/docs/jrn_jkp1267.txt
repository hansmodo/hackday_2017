The Cabinet met at the usual hour today, all the members present except the Postmaster-General, who is indisposed as I learn. Despatches were received last night from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>, which the Secretary of War produced and they were read. They gave a more detailed account of the battle of Monterey, but contained no explanation of the reasons which induced him to agree to the armistice. A separate despatch was in answer to the despatch from the Secretary of War of the 22d of September last, in relation to the proposed expedition into the interior of Tamaulipas, and against Tampico. It was written in bad temper, and was wholly unwarranted by the despatch of the Secretary of War to which it was a reply. The Secretary had proposed the expedition under the belief, which was the fact, that a sufficient force was left by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>, who was idle in camp on the Rio Grande, to constitute the expedition, but still the whole matter had been left to the discretion of General Taylor. The officers left with the troops on the Rio Grande were suggested to command the expedition. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor's</a> answer is in very bad taste and worse temper, in which among other things he states that he places his protest on file against such inter ference with him as chief-in-command of the army in Mexico. I refer to the correspondence itself as containing a more full explanation and statement of the whole matter than I can now give. I was very indignant at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor's</a> letter and directed the Secretary of War to prepare a proper answer. It is perfectly manifest that General Taylor is very hostile to the administration and seeks a cause of quarrel with it. This he shall not have unless he places himself wholly in the wrong, as indeed he has already done. He is evidently a weak man and has been made giddy with the idea of the Presidency. He is most ungrateful, for I have promoted him, as I now think, beyond his deserts, and without reference to his politics. I am now satisfied that he is a narrow-minded, bigoted partisan, without resources and wholly unqualified for the command he holds.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> called in the evening, and referring to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor's</a> despatch which he had read, condemned it and said that he ought to explain it, and that he would cause him to do so. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> informed me that he would leave for Mexico to take the command of the army, travelling via New York, where he would take a vessel on Monday next. He was in a good humour and was exceedingly grateful tome for having assigned him to the command. In truth it was the only alternative. I am now satisfied that anybody would do better than Taylor. Taylor is no doubt brave and will fight, but is not fit for a higher command than that of a regiment. I have no prejudice against him, but think he has acted with great weakness and folly.
