Report No. 43. 
<p></p>
HEADQUARTERS OP THE ARMY,

MEXICO, January 13, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a>.

SIR: 
<p></p>
I have not had a line from any public office at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> of a date later than October 26. 
<p></p>
The spy company has returned from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>; 
but it seeins that despatches for me had been intrusted 
to a special messenger (I suppose from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>), 
who, after a delay of many days at Perote, came up 
with the company to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">Puebla</a>, where he again stopped 
and retained all my letters. 
<p></p>
Brigadier-General Cadwallader has quietly occupied 
Toluca and Lerma. As was known, the State Govern 
ment had retired (thirteen leagues) to Sultepec. The 
general has invited that Government to provide for the 
payment of the assessment upon the State ; but there 
has not been yet time to receive a reply. 
<p></p>
Some days since, Colonel Wynkoop, of the 1st 
Pennsylvania Yolunteers, tendered his services to go, 
with a few men, to seize the guerilla priest, Jarauta, 
at the head of a small band that has long been the 
terror of all peaceable Mexicans within his reach, and 
who has frequently had skirmishes with our detachments. The colonel having missed that object, heard 
that General Valencia and staff were at a distant hacienda, and by hard riding in the night, succeeded in 
capturing that general and a colonel of his staff. I 
consider this handsome service worthy of being re 
corded. 
<p></p>
Colonel Hays, with a detachment of Texan Hangers, 
returned last night from a distant expedition in search 
of the robber priest. In a skirmish, without loss on 
his part, he killed some eight of Jarauta s men, and 
thinks that the priest was carried off among the many 
wounded. 
<p></p>
The spy company, coming up from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, had 
also a very successful affair with a large party of the 
enemy, and captured some forty prisoners, including 
three generals. 
<p></p>
The second train, now out from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a> eleven- 
days, was, as I learn by the enclosed correspondence, 
attacked by a numerous body of the enemy, and suffered 
a loss that looks like a disaster the first that we have 
sustained ; but further details are needed. 
<p></p>
I have the honor, etc., etc., 
<p></p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="me">WINFIELD SCOTT</a>.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wlm" rel="colleague met">HON. WM. L. MARCY</a>, SECRETARY OF WAR.
