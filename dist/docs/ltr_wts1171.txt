Dear Brother: The political aspect now is interesting 
to a looker-on. Sumner and Stevens would have made 
another civil war inevitably the President's antagonistic position saves us war save of words, and as I am 
a peace man I go for Johnson and the Veto. 
</p><p>
I recollect that Congress is but one of three co-ordinate 
branches of the Government. I want to hear the Supreme 
Court manifest itself, and then can guess at the conclusion. . . . Let Johnson fight it out with Sumner, who, 
though sincere, represents an antagonism as ultra as of 
Davis himself. Both are representative men, and it will 
be a pity if the great mass of our people have to go on 
fighting forever to demonstrate the fallacy of extreme 
opinions. 
</p><p>
The Republican party has lost forever the best chance 
they can ever expect of gaining recruits from the great 
middle class who want peace and industry. The white 
men of this country will control it, and the negro, in 
mass, will occupy a subordinate place as a race. We 
can secure them the liberty now gained, but we cannot 
raise them to a full equality in our day, even if at all. 
Had the Republicans graciously admitted the great 
principle of representation, leaving members to take the 
Ironclad Oath, you would have secured the active cooperation of such men as Sharkey, Parsons, Wm. A. 
Graham, Johnson, and others of the South, and it would 
not be many years before some of these States would 
have grown as rabid as Missouri, Maryland, and Arkansas are now disposed to be. The foolish querulousness 
of the Secessionists untamed would soon make a snarlish 
minority in their own States. Now, however, by the 
extreme measures begun and urged with so much vindictiveness, Sumner has turned all the Union people South 
as well as of the West against the party. ... It is 
surely unfortunate that the President is thus thrown 
seemingly on the old mischievous anti-war Democrats, 
but from his standpoint he had no alternative. To outsiders it looks as though he was purposely forced into 
that category. 
</p><p>
I know that the Freedmen Bureau Bill, and that for 
universal suffrage in the District, are impracticable and 
impolitic. Better let them slide, and devote time to 
putting the actual Government into the best shape the 
country admits of, letting other natural causes produce 
the results you aim at. Whenever State Legislatures 
and people oppress the negro they cut their own throats, 
for the negro cannot again be enslaved. Their mistakes will work to the interests of the great Union 
party. 
</p><p>
I can readily understand what the effect must be in 
your circle. How difficult it is to do anything, but if 
Congress does nothing it will be the greatest wisdom; 
for the business relations opening throughout the South 
will do more to restore peace and prosperity than all the 
laws that could be published in six months. 
</p><p>
I think Mr. Johnson would consent to a modification 
of the Constitution to change the basis of representation 
to suit the changed condition of the population South, 
but that is all he can or should do. ...

We need the Army Bills to get to work. I will have 
to abandon all the remote settlements to the chances of 
the Indians, for even after the bill passes, it will take 
months to enlist the men, and in the meantime all vol
