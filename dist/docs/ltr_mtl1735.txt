MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : I am writing this morning with, a broken heart after a sleepless night of 
great mental suffering. R. came up last evening like a maniac, and almost threatening his life, 
looking like death, because the letters of the <i>World</i> were published in yesterday's paper. I 
could not refrain from weeping when I saw him so miserable. But yet, my dear good Lizzie, was 
it not to protect myself and help others and was not my motive and action of the purest kind? 
</p><p>
Pray for me that this cup of affliction may pass from me, or be sanctified to me. I weep whilst 
I am writing. * * * I pray for death this morning. Only my darling Taddie prevents my taking my life. I shall have to 
endure a round of newspaper abuse from the Republicans because I dared venture to relieve 
a few of my wants. Tell Mr. Brady and Keyes not to have a line of mine once more in print. 
I am nearly losing my reason. 
</p><p>
Your friend,
