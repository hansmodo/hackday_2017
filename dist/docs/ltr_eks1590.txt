ARMY of OCCUPATION,

I wrote you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> that we should reach 
Aransas on the fourteenth we were there on the 
morning of the thirteenth, having had a most delight 
ful run of only sixty hours from the city. The first 
night we were on the Gulf I was informed that Mrs. 
Roth (a camp woman of my company) was sick. Poor 
thing ! I gave her my stateroom, and by morning 
she was delivered of a son. This was the second birth 
on the route. The mothers are now both well, and 
doing their regular washing for the men. . . . The 
" Alabama," in which we crossed the Gulf, is a large 
steamship of too much draught to enter the Bay, and 
we were compelled to disembark on steam lighters in 
the open roadstead, where there is always a heavy sea, 
a dangerous and disagreeable duty. Thompson lost 
his tents in its performance; the tierce containing 
them being washed overboard, a most serious loss, 
depriving his company of the only shelter his men and 
women have, compelling the rest to divide with him 
and crowding all.

On the next day we were all prepared on two small 
steamboats and got under way for this point about 
thirty miles from St. Joseph s Island. On the route we 
passed the wreck of the " Dayton," a boat which was 
blown up on the thirteenth. The explosion instantly 
killed two officers, Lieutenants Higgins and Berry, of 
the Fourth Infantry, a sergeant, and five men. Some 
others have since died of their wounds. Captain 
Grossman and Lieutenant Gordon were thrown some 
fifty or sixty yards from the boat, but, incredible as it 
may appear, were not seriously injured. The melan 
choly of this terrible accident was much heightened 
by the fact that Lieutenant Higgins had been mar 
ried, but a few days before being ordered here, to 
the daughter of Captain Morrison of the Third 
Infantry.

At night, the fourteenth, during a violent thunder 
storm, we cast anchor opposite to the camp fires of the 
Army of Occupation. They extended along the beach, 
apparently for more than a mile, on the south of the 
Nueces River, consequently in the disputed territory. 
Amid the gloom and rain I stumbled along the shore, 
seeking for headquarters to make my report, greeted 
frequently, as I passed the camp, by cordial welcomes 
from the well-known voices of old companions, whom 
I had not met for years. In the morning we landed 
and commenced our encampment, a most arduous 
undertaking, having to cut off a dense thicket which 
covered the whole ground infested with rattle snakes 
and insects. By night we were all in our canvas 
houses, though there were frequent snake alarms during the whole night. The climate here is perfectly 
delicious and healthy; no possibility of sickness, and 
so cool from the trade wind, which blows steadily, that 
our cloth clothing is very comfortable. All prospect 
of meeting with the Mexican forces has vanished, and 
the supposition now is that we shall remain in this 
neighborhood, perhaps march to the Rio Grande, 
until all difficulty is settled by negotiation between 
the two governments.

There is at the southern extremity of the camp, 
about three-fourths of a mile from our position, a 
settlement called a ranch. It is, in fact, a Mexican 
trading place. There are some dozen houses, most of 
them stores. Here the Mexicans from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> 
and other places come constantly. They more resemble negroes than whites. I have as yet hardly had 
time to observe anything. I haven t even been on the 
hill back of us, but understand that the country is one 
vast prairie covered with droves of mustangs. We 
have fine fish in abundance, but in every other particular depend upon the commissary, " pork and 
beans being the chief of our diet." 
</p><p>
I wish you could take a look at us. On the right are 
the Second Dragoons, on the left a corps of artillery 
volunteers from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>. The camp covers the 
ground for more than a mile, as near in a line as the 
shore will permit, and when the residue of the troops 
ordered here have arrived will be the largest body of 
regulars, it is said, which has been assembled since 
the Revolution.
