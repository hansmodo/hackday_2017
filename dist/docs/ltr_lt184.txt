<p> Dear Ruth,
<p> At long last I am at least starting a letter to you, and hope you won&#8217;t mind if it is in pencil. I was sure I put a pen in my purse, but guess I was wrong again.
<p> I am waiting in Dr. Kirk&#8217;s office for a treatment and there are mobs of people here so guess I&#8217;ll be here a good long time. 4:30 was the best they could do in the way of an appointment- I feel  terrible taking up his time when he is so busy, and I&#8217;m not ever a pay patient ( I guess ) but would feel better about it if I was.
<p> Claire is keeping the baby for me and I&#8217;m going to pay her. She is in charge of feeding him and looking after him until I get back. I may be quite late. 
<p> Yesterday, Aunt Learie and I went to San Francisco, but we didn&#8217;t have a very good day of it. My car wouldn&#8217;t start up, I spent an hour trying to get it going, but with no success. Finally decided to take Uncle Franks car and it was about 10:40 when I went to get Aunt Learie. Her appointment was for 11:15 so she called and had it changed to 1:30. Got to San Francisco about 12:15, had lunch at the Pig &#8216;n Whistle, went to Dr. Sheppard&#8217;s (sp? HML ). Had time to do a little shopping before we had to start back, but it wasn&#8217;t much fun for me as I felt terrible. By the time we got home, my head was splitting, only to find a cross mother and grandmother. Scootch was ok though, and laughed and ran up next to me. He was so cute, bless his heart.
<p> I think that&#8217;s enough of my troubles- how are you? And are you as homesick and blue as mom thinks you are? Hope not- she is just imagining things. Cheer up- J.P. should be back by Christmas. Anyway, come the 2nd Mark will have been gone 9 months- half the time up- and long enough to have a baby! Wish we did have each other. Scootch will be to old to enjoy the companionship of his brother or sister by the time we manage to have another. I received a long letter from John C. the other day. She sounded much happier and content, apparently has a man in tow. Has decided that she has gotten over Gayle. Hope she&#8217;s right because he never made her happy. She has moved, but I don&#8217;t have her address here with me. If I don&#8217;t finish this while I am here, will take it home and jot the address down.
<p> It has been so long since I have written to you that I can&#8217;t seem to think of everything to say.
<p> This morning downtown Scootch and I saw Frances Hecky and her baby. He is a nice looking baby- he weighs 12 pounds and isn&#8217;t 6 weeks old yet. When I get better I must go over to see them. 
<p> I haven&#8217;t accomplished any work that I can see- had to take Scootch to the Hardenberg on Saturday so didn&#8217;t ever get the house cleaned. 
<p> Here I am back home again and it&#8217;s late- almost eleven, but by hook or crook I&#8217;ll get this letter to you finished. The dress you sent Grandma came today, and she is awfully tickled with it. It looks swell on her and is so pretty. She says to thank you very much! It fits quite well too. Now she wants to get a gray hat and coat- hope she will. Then if she goes anywhere, she&#8217;ll be all set. I gave her a bed- jacket and money for a hat. Mom gave her a pin and some towels. Aunt Elsie gave her stockings. Aunt [unknown] some vases and some money.
<p> Tomorrow I am going up to Colma to have lunch with Edna Johnsen and some of the girls we were in training with. She is due to leave soon, so although I really don&#8217;t feel like going, I want to see her. 
<p> I ironed some tonite and will hide the rest so Grandma won&#8217;t think she needs to do it. I think I may spend next week or part of it at mothers. I can see evidence of friction- she she thinks Grandma is too crabby- and mom is to blame too, you know how she is. I think she feels hurt because she doesn&#8217;t get to see us more, so maybe it will clear the atmosphere if we go down there. Aunt Ruth and Uncle Charley are going to move again. They have found a nice place at Homestead Road with a nice yard. They plan to move April 1st.- traditional moving day for all New Yorkers! Must remember to tell her that.
<p> My head hurts me a lot and I have been taking A.P.C. tablets by the bottle, but this evening had to take a half a grain of codeine to make it let up a little so I&#8217;d feel like ironing. No one except mom I think really realizes how bum I feel.
<p> Must get off to sleep now, dear one- hope you can make some sense out of all of this. I&#8217;m not going to even read it over.
<p> Worlds of love,
<p> Lois
