SIR, 
</p><p>
Suffer me to join in congratulating you, on your 
appointment to be General and Commander-in-Chief of 
the troops raised, or to be raised, for the defence of 
American liberty. Men, who have tasted freedom, 
and who have felt their personal rights, are not 
easily taught to bear with encroachments on either, 
or brought to submit to oppression. Virtue ought 
always to be made the object of government. Justice is firm and permanent. 
</p><p>
His Majesty's ministers have artfully induced the 
Parliament to join in their measures, to prosecute 
the dangerous and increasing difference between Great 
Britain and these Colonies with rigor and military 
force y whereby the latter are driven to an absolute 
necessity to defend their rights and properties by 
raising forces for their security. 
</p><p>
The Honorable Congress have proclaimed a Fast to be 
observed by the inhabitants of all the English Colonies 
on this continent, to stand before the Lord in one day, 
with public humiliation, fasting, and prayer, to deplore 
our many sins, to offer up our joint supplications to 
God, for forgiveness, and for his merciful interposition 
for us in this day of unnatural darkness and distress. 
</p><p>
They have, with one united voice, appointed you to 
the high station you possess. The Supreme Director 
of all events hath caused a wonderful union of hearts 
and counsels to subsist among us. 
</p><p>
Now, therefore, be strong and very courageous. May the God of the armies of Israel shower down 
the blessings of his Divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> on you, give you wisdom and fortitude, cover your head in the 
day of battle and danger, add success, convince our 
enemies of their mistaken measures, and that all their 
attempts to deprive these Colonies of their inestimable 
constitutional rights and liberties are injurious and 
vain. I am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
