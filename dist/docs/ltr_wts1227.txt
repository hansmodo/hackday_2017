Dear Brother: I am just back from a trip to Carthage, Joplin, etc., in Southwest Missouri. Thence to 
Kansas City in a week, and find an unusual pile of 
letters for answer, yours of June llth among the number. This calls for an answer, for I fear even you suppose I was coquetting with the Chicago Convention. Of 
course this is not true, and if you could be here to see 
the letters and telegrams received by me marked 
"Strictly confidential," from parties even you cannot 
conjecture, you would have to admit that my course was 
fair, honest, and straightforward. . . .

Henderson, and Henderson alone, had a scratch of pen 
or even telegram which could be tortured into authority 
to personate me. I talked with him before I went to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and explained fully that in no event and 
under no circumstances would I assent to the use of my 
name as a Presidential candidate. He contended that no 
American citizen could disobey the "call of his country," but I insisted that the Chicago Convention was not 
this country. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
