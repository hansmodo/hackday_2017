My dear Dr 
</p><p>
Your two letters of the same date the 1 5th ins was this moment 
rec d one informing me of dear Anns safe arrival with the children at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a>, except Bob who was left at school in Kentucky which informa 
tion was a source of the greatest gratification to me, & where I hope she 
as well as the children will not only continue to enjoy good health, but 
will pass their time as pleasantly as could be expected until you are able 
to join them ; I know it will afford her mother the greatest gratification 
possible to have them with her at any time & more especially during my absence 
</p><p>
I deeply regret to hear of the illness of Col Taylors children, ot 
which he has been apprized, & which he is hardly in a situation to bear 
up against as he might otherwise do, as his health is very feeble, he is 
just recovering from a severe attack of sickness. It was a matter also 
of deep concern to learn the indisposition of my sister, she has been the 
child of misfortune, but a purer spirit never tenanted the bust of any 
one, & I hope her lot in another world will be as free from sorrow & 
care, as it has been subjected to the same in this life. I feel gratified for 
the attentions shown Ann on her way from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> to Baton Rouge, particularly in Kentucky ; the offer of Mr Tibbets 1 to get an appointment 
in the navy for John, I make no doubt was sincere, but how far he has 
the ability to do so is quite doubtful, as I understand he has left the 
democratic ranks, otherwise he would only been under the necessity of 
making his wishes known in regard to the same to have secured it ; & it 
may still be the case, & as he has proffered his good offices in the matter 
I consider it would be as well to make use of them as far as they would 
go, writing at a proper time calling his attention to his promises. As 
Judge McLean will very soon be in Washington & may call <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a>s attention to the subject ; however everything of the kind is now 
done through or by political influence. I hope the school Rob has been 
placed at will prove a good one & that he will be greatly benefitted by 
the same 
</p><p>
I deeply feel for your good & aged mother at the severe trial she 
must undergo whenever the death of your brother is made known to her, 
which cannot always be concealed from her, & much fear the announce 
ment of it will be more than she can bear up against & that she will sink 
under the same, should & no doubt will be broken to her with the 
utmost caution & the greatest delicacy Had he died as I stated before 
with his family around him, his loss alth it would have been severely 
felt by them all, could have been borne up against by all accept your 
mother & perhaps her, but under the circumstances it will be doubly distressing, & I greatly fear will have the most unhappy effects on the neves 
of his surviving parent ; yet I sincerely hope for the best, & that he who 
watches over & directs all things, will enable her to bear up at least with 
resignation & composure against this severest of trials & afflictions ; 
keeping in mind the expectation & hope of meeting him in that world 
in which the precepts of our holy religion teaches us to believe where 
sorrow ceases, & the weary are at rest 
</p><p>
It must be under all the afflictions of those who he has left to 
mourn his untimely end a great consolation for them to know he died a 
good Christian & an honest man ; that the affairs of others entrusted to 
him, were found as they should have been, as well as that he left his wife 
& children in easy circumstances 
</p><p>
I left here on the 13th  ins with part of the com d for Saltillo to take 
possession & occupy the same, where we arrived on the 16th  & after 
remaining there four days making certain arrangements I returned here 
without meeting with any opposition from the enemy, or any occurrence 
taking place worthy of notice ; I got back on the 2j d & the day after 
rec d the package of papers you were so good as to send me, for which 
you have my sincere thanks, as well as for the extracts cut out of various 
newspapers Gen Worth was left in command at Saltillo, with 9 cop s 
of artillery, the 5th & 8th  Infy & two comp 3 of 2 d Dragoons ; besides 
which I shall order forward some reenforcements to join him 
</p><p>
Gen Wools column has turned out an entire failure, which, I expected from the first would be the case, he found after he crossed the Rio 
Grande & reached to Monclova, which was about the last of Oct r that 
his reaching Chihuahua was pretty much an impossibility, & even if he 
succeeded in doing so, it would be of but little avail if any, he therefore 
proposed to join my column, & about which time I rec d orders from 
Washington to order him to do so ; from all I can learn there appears to 
be much dissatisfaction in his com d some of which I think he is disposed 
for want of a better excuse, to attribute to me ; but in this I may be mis 
taken If I had his transportation which with him has turned out 
entirely useless, I might have accomplished some what more than I have done 
</p><p>
I have ordered him to take a position at Parras, a town about 100 
miles to the west of Saltillo in the best grain country in Northern 
Mexico where he can procure abundant supply of flour, corn & beef, & 
where he can unite with Worths com d should Santa Anna attempt to 
make a move on the latter at Saltillo from his present position San Luis Potosi 
</p><p>
The dep c has determined to hold on to what we have got in the 
West, & not to risk its loss by pushing farther into the enemies country, 
which I consider a wise determination ; we shall therefore act only on the 
diffinsive in this quarter ; in fact we have advanced as far from our base 
in this quarter as we ought to venture The dep 1 however seems 
anxious to take Vera Cruz, & I have been instructed if I approve the 
same, to detach a force of 4,000 men one half regulars, the balance vol 
unteers from the lower Rio Grande, under Majr Gen Patterson on that 
service or for that object, which I have declined doing, informing the 
hon. Secretary of War, that I did not consider less than 10,000 men 
4000 of whom should be regulars, should be sent on that duty ; that if 
they would organize in the States 6,000 efficient men, send them to Vera Cruz with all the necessary tools, battering train, as well as everything 
else necessary for carrying on the most active operations on landing, & 
would let me know in season, I would try & detach 4000 to join them, 
under Gen P. or any one else they might designate 
</p><p>
It appears that Tampico has been taken possession of by the navy, 
which they speak of as having been done as by force on their part, say 
ing it was an unconditional surrender ; the fact is the place was evacuated 
some time before they went there ; brought about by the defeat of the 
enemy here, who removed their cannon & other military & public stores 
long before the navy went there wheel carriages through any of the passes of the mountains between this 
point & the gulf 
</p><p>
The congress of both nations will be in session in a few days, & 
alth prospects are unfavorable for doing so at present, yet I truly hope 
before they seperate something will be done to bring about a settlement 
of all existing difficulties between the two countries. At any rate I am 
very desirous to know what our congress will do in the matter ; whether 
or not they will vote the men & money necessary for prosecuting the 
war with vigor ; some say it has already cost two hundred millions ; but 
I presume that is greatly beyond the facts in the case 
</p><p>
Wishing you & yours continued health & prosperity 
</p><p>
I remain Truly 
</p><p>
& Sincerely your Friend
