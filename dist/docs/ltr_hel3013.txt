SIR, 
</p><p>
In obedience to the direction of Congress, I am to 
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th 
instant. Congress, with great concern, perceive that 
your sensibility is wounded by their resolutions. 
Placing the firmest confidence in your prudence, abilities, and integrity, they wish to preserve that harmony with you, which is essential to the general 
weal. You may rest assured, that, far from any intention to give you pain, their resolutions have no 
other motives or end but the public good. They therefore hope that you will not, in future, be distressed by apprehensions as injurious to their honor 
as they are to your own feelings. 
</p><p>
However different the views of Congress may seem 
to you now from what you supposed them to be 
when you entered into your late engagements with 
General Howe, Congress certainly had nothing in 
view but a proper respect to the dignity, safety, and 
independence of these States. The duplicity of General Howe, and authentic information that the gentlemen appointed by you to negotiate the cartel held 
opinions repugnant to the sense of Congress, con 
strained them, in a matter of such high moment as 
forming a general cartel, to express their sentiments 
in an explicit manner, lest they might have only to 
lament, when it was out of their power to remedy, a 
misapprehension on points deeply affecting, in their 
judgment, the safety and honor of these States. 
</p><p>
Congress expected you would consider their resolutions of the 30th ultimo in the light of private instructions, calculated to show their sense with respect 
to the general outlines of the proposed cartel ; a 
practice usual with the supreme power of every State 
in similar cases. You observe that a strict adherence 
to all the resolutions of Congress must, of necessity, 
destroy all idea of a cartel ; but, as a distinction can 
easily be made betwixt such of the resolutions of 
Congress as flow from general principles of policy, 
and those which arise from circumstances which have 
rendered a variation from time to time necessary, it 
is conceived that an attention to this discrimination 
will rid you of those embarrassments, which you may, 
at first view, think yourself entangled with. The re 
solution of Congress of the 19th December, respecting 
the mode of settlement for supplies to the enemy's 
prisoners, seems not to have been sufficiently attended to. It is left at the option of the enemy to pay 
either in coin, dollar for dollar, or in provisions 
equal in quantity and kind to what is furnished. 
Whatever objections may be made against the first 
mode, there surely cannot be a more just and equal 
ratio than the latter. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> lately made the same objections on this point, which are carried 
to you; but, on being reminded of the alternative 
offered by the resolution, he acquiesced, and the victualling-ships are now actually delivering provisions 
in payment for what they received. The Commissaries of Prisoners, on each side, may pass receipts 
for the rations received, expressing the quantum of 
each article received for the subsistence of the prisoners in the power of the contracting parties, and 
the balance may be paid in provisions or in coin, at 
the option of either party. 
</p><p>
The mode suggested by you is liable to this strong 
objection; that it would lay us under the necessity 
of furnishing the enemy's prisoners with us, as well 
as ours with them, with provisions; which certainly 
would be a capital advantage to them, if we consider 
the distance whence they must derive their supplies. 
The resolution of the 30th December was a measure 
naturally flowing from the treason acts, which the 
respective States have passed in consequence of the 
express recommendation of Congress. On a mature 
deliberation, they are convinced that a deviation from 
it would be subversive of our character as an independent people, in consistence with sound policy. No 
act of Congress can suspend the operation of the 
laws of the different States, and therefore they can 
not consent that any measure should be adopted in 
the proposed cartel, which may contravene this resolution. 
</p><p>
It does not, however, appear to Congress that any 
embarrassment will arise in this matter, unless the 
enemy should insist upon an article in the cartel, 
that Americans, taken in arms, shall be entitled to the 
benefits of an exchange. Under the terms u officer for officer, soldier for soldier," which are generally 
used in cartels, traitors would no more be included 
by the laws of nations than deserters. The carrying 
this resolution into practice can depend only on the 
will of the several States, who, in this respect, must 
be presumed to be governed by principles of policy. 
of which they must necessarily be competent judges. 
With respect to the resolution concerning General 
Lee, at his request Congress are willing that you 
should waive his exchange for Major-General Prescott, 
as a preliminary article. It is, however, their intention that no cartel be acceded to, unless it be expressly admitted therein, that General Lee be ex 
changed for General Prescott, 
</p><p>
Congress have taken measures for purchasing such 
articles of Captain Cottineau's cargo as are necessary 
for the army. 
</p><p>
By order of Congress, 
</p><p>
