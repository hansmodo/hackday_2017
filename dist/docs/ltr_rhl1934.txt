SIR As a friend to the just and proper rights of human nature, but particularly as an American, I acknowledge great obligation to you, for the wise and welltimed care, you have taken of our common liberty. 
</p><p>
Whilst men in general, are thoughtless and indolent, spirit and wisdom are necessary to rouse and inform minds, that incline to what is right, and wish happiness, 
You, sir, on this occasion, have the honour of giving a just alarm, and of demonstrating the late measures to be, 
at once, destructive of public liberty, and in violation of those rights which God and nature have given us. 
</p><p>
To prevent the success of this unjust system, an union of counsel and action among all the colonies, is 
undoubtedly necessary. The politician of Italy delivered the result of reason and experience, when he proposed the way to conquest, by division. How to effect 
this union, in the wisest and firmest manner, perhaps, time and much reflection, only, can show. But well to understand each other, and timely to be informed of 
what passes, both here and in Great Britain, it would seem that not only select committees should be appointed 
by all the colonies, but that a private correspondence should be conducted between the lovers of liberty in every province. 
</p><p>
From my brother, Dr. Lee, I have been informed of the kindness, with which you have expressed your willingness to begin a correspondence with me. To 
effectuate this good purpose, sir, I have taken the earliest opportunity of informing you, that when you are pleased to write, your letter to me by post, directed to 
the care of Dr. Mortimer, Hobb's Hole, Virginia, will meet with a safe conveyance. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with singular esteem, your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>

To JOHN DICKINSON,
