Dear Brother : Your letter of the 8th is received this 
morning, and at the same moment I hear through K. W. 
that you will be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lancaster" rel="city">Lancaster</a> to-day. I wrote you 
some days ago about public opinion as to your arrangement with Johnston, but presume you did not get 
it. It is now manifest that many high officials seized 
upon that arrangement to ruin you, and you will not be 
wise if you allow them to do it. Especially don't ever 
think of resigning. Your position is too high and valuable to be drawn from it by temporary hostile political 
power. Remember the case of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="">Scott</a> after the Mexican 
War. The mystery to me is that Stanton acted as he 
did. If his motive was malicious, he is certainly the 
worst devil I ever read of. He manifested and assumed 
the intensest kindness for you, and certainly showed it 
to me. I still think that with him it was mere anger, 
the explosion of a very bad temper, and if so, I 
sincerely trust no breach will be made. With <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> 
I was not disappointed. Has Johnson any enmity to 
you? I have not seen him since his elevation, and have 
feared he was at the bottom of the business. It is also 
manifest to me, that the bitter hostility shown you 
springs partly from political jealousy, a fear of the 
future. Much of this is aimed at me. I have observed 
that every man who is opposed to me is eager to assail 
you, while my personal friends, even among the Radicals, have defended you. . . . Chase, you know, is in 
favor of negro suffrage, and Jay and Henry Cooke are 
old Republicans, yet they have uniformly, in public and 
in social circles, sustained you. So with the newspapers. The feeling has so subsided and reacted that 
you can afford to be calm and cautious. Grant is a 
jewel. I hope two things, that you will have no controversy with him, and never resign. 
</p><p>
It was my purpose to go to-morrow to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, 
but I will now delay it until Friday or Saturday. I 
suppose you will soon return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. I may be 
there some days, and hope to meet you there. . . . 
</p><p>
Now as to your arrangement with Johnston. I think 
the judgment of unprejudiced men has settled upon the 
conviction that your terms were too liberal. The recognition of the rebel state organizations, now completely 
in the hands of the worst men of the South, will not answer. They could perpetuate their sway, and we should 
inevitably have new difficulties. Lincoln first recognized 
the Legislature of Virginia, but after full reflection abandoned it. Why did not Stanton and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> denounce 
Lincoln? And why suppress the fact that you were 
acting in accordance with that precedent? Still I think 
it was not advisable to recognize the state officials. In 
my opinion, it would have been wise for you to have 
insisted upon the recognition of the emancipation/proclamation, at least until the courts passedjipjm-ifer'lt would 
be very wrong to let these rebels enjoy again the unpaid 
labor of their slaves. Both these questions are past. 
</p><p>
As to negro suffrage, I admit the negroes are not intelligent enough to vote, but some one must vote their 
political representation in the States where they live, 
and their representation is increased by their being free. 
Whp^ shall exercise this political power? Shall the rebels 
do so? If yes, will they not now in effect restore slavery? 
</p><p>
Will they not oppress the negroes? Is it not hard to 
turn these negroes over to the laws made by the very 
men who endeavored to overthrow the Government? 
After all, how much more ignorant are these slaves than 
the uneducated white people down South? I assure you, 
that while I will not commit myself on these matters, I 
feel sorely troubled about them, and would be glad to 
talk with you in respect to them. . . .

Affectionately yours,
