MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
THIS day I received yours of the 2d. I have received all the votes from all the States. It is known 
that Georgia voted with North Carolina, Virginia and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; and Kentucky voted for Jefferson. There 
is no other newspaper circulated in the back country of 
the southern States than Freneau's National Gazette, 
which is employed with great industry to poison the 
minds of the people. The federal court has again 
had a sitting in Virginia, and by reason of <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>'s 
sickness, the great cause is again continued, which 
serves to keep up the rage in that State and North 
Carolina, which is its echo.

If you hire the man you mention, you should 
know before hand what kind of skill and experience 
he has in farming, as well as his integrity and good 
disposition. I shall leave it, however, to you. Twenty-six pounds are too high. Twenty-four are enougrf ; 
but if you cannot get one for less, we must give 
twenty -six.

I expect, ere long, to hear that Paine is split and 
sliced for an aristocrat; perhaps roasted, or broiled, 
or fried. He is too lean to make a good pie, but he 
is now in company with a number who are admirably 
qualified and disposed to feed upon each other. The 
foolish vote of the constituting assembly in favor of 
a rotation and excluding themselves from being re- 
elected has cost every man of weight and talents 
among them his life, or his country and his fortune. 
All are murdered, banished and confiscated. Danton, 
Robespierre, Marat, &c., are furies. Dragon's teeth 
have been sown in France and come up monsters. 
The army has behaved better, and the people seem to 
be zealous ; but if they have not some system by 
which they can be united, what is to be expected ? 
We have our Robespierres and Marats, whose wills 
are good to do mischief, but the flesh is weak. They 
cannot yet persuade the people to follow them. If 
the National Assembly can subdue the mutinous rabble at Paris as well as Dumourier has driven the 
Prussians, they may be free, and do something, but 
what, I know not. 
</p><p>
Tenderly yours,
