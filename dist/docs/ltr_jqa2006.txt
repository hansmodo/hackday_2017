HONORED SIR : 
</p><p>
I was in the House of Commons the day before yesterday again, and heard the debates upon the subject of parliamentary reform. I was witness to something very extraordinary. I mean that Mr. Fox spoke with Mr. Pitt in 
support of the motion, and Mr. Dundas, with Lord North against it. I have never been so much pleased with the debates as that day. Alderman Sawbridge moved for a 
committee to inquire into the state of parliamentary representation, and after several of the secondary speakers had 
delivered briefly their opinions, Lord North made a masterly speech against the motion, and was about two hours and 
an half delivering it. But Mr. Pitt, in a speech of a little more than an hour's length, took Lord N[orth]'s arguments 
all to pieces and turned them all against them. He spoke in a most striking and pathetic manner of the unfortunate 
situation in which this country now is, and endeavored to show that it was for the most part owing to the defects of 
the representation in Parliament. This speech confirmed me in my opinion that he is the best speaker in the house, and I really think that 
</p><p>
Take him for all in all 
</p><p>
I shall not look upon his like again. 
</p><p>
Mr. Dundas spoke for about half an hour against parliamentary reform, at least for the present time. Mr. Fox 
then spoke near an hour and a half extremely well for the motion. He made use of a great number of very artful 
and specious arguments against Mr. Pitt, and seemed as if he found some consolation for his misfortunes in [tea]sing 
the minister, tho he spoke on the same side of the question. But tho I don t pretend to say Mr. Pitt surpasses him in 
argumentation, yet I think nobody will deny that he does in the delivery. Mr. Fox has a small impediment in his 
speech, and one would think his nose was stopped by a cold when he speaks, whereas Mr. P[itt] has the clearest 
voice and most distinct pronunciation of any person I ever remember to have heard. But they are both very great 
men, and it is a real misfortune for this country that those talents which were made to promote the honor and the 
power of the nation should be prostituted to views of interest and of ambition. Your dutiful son.
