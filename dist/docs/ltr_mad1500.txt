DEAR SIR, In pursuance of my intentions, as explained in 
my last, dated in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I came to this City on Saturday 
last. The information I have here received convinces me that 
I cannot accomplish the whole route I had planned within the 
time to which I am limited, nor go from this to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> in the 
mode which I had reckoned upon. I shall therefore decline 
this part of my plan, at least for the present, and content myself with a trip to Fort Schuyler, in which I shall gratify my 
curiosity in several respects, and have the pleasure of the Marquis's company. We shall set off this afternoon in a Barge up 
the North River. The Marquis has received in this City a 
continuation of those marks of cordial esteem and affection 
which were hinted in my last. The Gazettes herewith enclosed 
will give you samples of them. Besides the personal homage 
he receives, his presence has furnished occasion for fresh manifestations of those sentiments towards France which have been 
so well merited by her, but which her Enemies pretended would 
soon give way to returning affection for G. Britain. In this 
view, a republication of those passages in the Gazettes of France 
may be of advantage to us. They will at least give pleasure 
to the Friends of the Marquis.

We have an account from Canada, how far to be relied on I 
cannot say, that the Indians have surprised and plundered Michillimackinac, where the English had a great amount of Stores 
and Merchandize, and that they have refused to treat with Sir 
John Johnson. 
</p><p>
The Marquis has shewn me a passage in his letter to the 
Count de Vergennes, in which he sketches the idea relative to 
the Mississippi. He says he has not had time to dilate upon it, 
but that his next letter will do it fully.
