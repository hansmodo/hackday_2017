Dear <a href="results.php?tla=jpe" rel="spouse">J.P.</a><br>

Got your letter yesterday - written on the 5th. Mail is funny now - seems odd I imagine to get 2 letters written that far apart. Your's have been coming through quite well considering everything. No, you aren't in the doghouse for typing the letter you wrote on the 20th - heck, I don't care whether you type or write - but will say so far the typical letters have usually been longer and long letters are nice!
<p>
Say, what do you mean by sending propaganda through the mail anyway? Also - what were you doing in those duds? I'm so glad you had a nice dinner even if you did have to work for it - guess it just gave you a better appetite anyway.
<p>
Got two letters yesterday - one from <a href="results.php?tla=mbk" rel="parent">Mom</a> and one from Doris Mae telling of <a href="results.php?tla=hrb" rel="kin">Grandpa's</a> death. That was the first I knew about it since they didn't wire - for which I'm glad. He certainly lived a long life - hope I don't live to be 95 or 96 but if I do I hope I can be as active as he was. Also glad it's over and he didn't have to be bedridden for months. He'd have hated that. I was a little surprised , but not very, and now I wonder how long <a href="results.php?tla=mjh" rel="kin">Grandma</a> will last?
<p>
<a href="results.php?tla=csy" rel="kin">Uncle Charlie</a> is getting along fairly well - they were to start grafting the skin on his right hand this week - which has done much better than they expected. I've got a bunch of cards and am going to sandwich them in letters. He's absolutely helpless and the time drags.
<p>
Say, what ya mean? - put your picture in the garden? - What garden and what parlor? Guess I'll have to find another place for it. Maybe I can squeeze it my dresser in my mirror?
<p>
Oh yes, seems I've  seen you mowing a lawn - you can still do it eh? That's good - very necessary sometimes!
<p>
<p>
Sunday - 8:45.
<p>
Didn't get this finished yesterday, got hungry and so we went out to dinner which was excellent. A small place half a block down the street, not exactly cheap but not as expensive as some. Anyway, you don't mind if the food is good and you're full when finished. Donna and I both agree on eating thank heavens, and Freddie has been going with us quite a bit too. So many of these girls just eat sandwiches and stuff over Sunday which is really very foolish. When we get home we read. Rather I did - till midnight. Believe it or not - but that's the first evening I've one that since I got here - and now I'm a little caught up - but precious little Vera keeps writing and telling me to read this and that - and I never read anything. Don't know where the time goes but it sure does. 
<p>
I've been sitting here thinking of you dear - things I can remember about you and different things you have written. Then I wondered just how we would act when we again meet - and it is amusing to think of. do so much want to see you again, and no I wouldn't have it any other way - if you want to  think of me go right ahead - maybe it's about even.
<p>
It's cold as anything here today - very strong wind and ice about an inch thick which hasn't melted at all. Really miserable.
<p>
Not anything more to write so I'll say Bye now, Lovingly yours, 
<p>
