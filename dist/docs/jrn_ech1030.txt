I have prospected enough to dig out about 75 cents, and I have been digging and ditching on the lot, hoping soon to master the water.

Yesterday afternoon a bloody tragedy was enacted in the town, resulting in the death of a young man named Marcey, of Massachusetts. A man named Messick accused Marcey of robbing him of seven hundred dollars while on a drunken frolic together last winter, and it is said had sworn to shoot Marcey the first time he saw him. He had armed himself early in the morning with a double-barrelled shot gun heavily charged with buckshot, and lay in wait until the afternoon, expecting Marcey to pass that way. By and by Marcey made his appearance, only armed with a sheath knife and revolver, as is usual in this country, and an altercation took place, in which Marcey endeavored to clear himself of the charges brought against him. He was about going away when Messick cocked both barrels of his gun and asked the other if he was armed, and he replied that he was, and that he would fight him in a fair fight but he would not fight in that way. Messick then told him to defend himself, to which he replied that he might fire if he would. At this he fired one barrel which the other received principally in the right arm, and instantly turned with his back towards the man with the gun, who seeing that the other did not fall, immediately fired the other barrel which took effect through the lungs and heart. Marcey fell, uttered a few words and was a corpse in a few minutes. Messick,
with a companion, left at once for parts unknown. The deceased has a number of mules and for some time had been engaged in the packing trade. Of him all speak favorably.

Last night was the coldest night we have had since our arrival in Mariposa, a very heavy frost having fallen, and the tin pans containing water outside of our tent were frozen entirely over. We sat out by our campfire, enjoying the magnificent moonlight evening.
