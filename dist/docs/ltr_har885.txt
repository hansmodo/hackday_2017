SAN FRANCISCO, November 5th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>.
</p><p>
In this famous city and in its surroundings, there are so many places of interest to a stranger that I find it impossible to visit them all. A few days ago we took a drive on the San Bruno turnpike, a delightful road that winds along the margin of the bay, and around the spurs of Mount Bruno, that terminate upon it. On the one hand lay the placid waters of the bay; on the other, mountain spurs and intervening valleys of rare beauty. It is one of Nature's theatres, in which she appears clad in all her native charms.
</p><p>
Along the line of the bay, and within a few rods of us, thousands of waterfowl, ducks and geese, were swimming, or flying about in groups, quite fearless of man and thoughtless of danger. On the land-side, the natural scenery was ever varying, as we rounded the sharp points and projections of the mountain spurs. Here was an
alcove, and there a cradled valley, of surpassing beauty. Some of these valleys are occupied by settlers. It was cheering to see the neat farm-house, the white cottage on the hillside, the garden, the meadow, and the cultivated fields. It is here that you may find not only the "happy valley," but a great many of them. The views in every direction, from the hills and from the bay, are grand, combining the romantic with the beautiful.

In the distance, on the opposite side of the bay, Mount Diablo lifts his giant form, as if taking a quiet survey of this lovely realm. He feels interested, I doubt not, in the "march of civilization," and is waiting patiently for opportunities. They say, go where you will, the evil one is ever present. Diablo is a prominent landmark, being the meridian point in the survey of the State; a lofty mountain, standing alone in the midst of the surrounding plains. There is an extensive coal mine connected with it, that furnishes several of the neighboring towns with fuel. In the course of our ride we crossed the San Jose Railroad, and stopped to rest our horses at a farm-house, belonging to our friend, one of the party, who resides in the city. We returned by the Mission Bay route, led by the stars. It was a delightful excursion, and one which we shall long remember.
</p><p>
We next visited the famous Dry Dock, at
Hunter's Point, on the bay. It is a marvelous work, which does the engineer, who planned and excavated it, infinite credit. It is cut in solid rock, originally the spur of a mountain, which projected into the bay. It is oval in shape, and looks like a vast stone trough. It is four hundred and sixty-five feet long, one hundred and twenty-five wide and forty-five deep, and receives the largest class of ships. It cost over a million of dollars, and belongs to a joint stock company. There is nothing like it, or that can equal it for convenience, elsewhere.

There are so many pleasant spots, villas and towns, in the vicinity of San Francisco, that it is quite impossible for me to describe the half of them. The truth is, it is a realm of natural beauty, so improved by art, as to baffle my descriptive powers. If you would know all about it, you must come and see for yourself; there is positively no other way of acquiring a true knowledge of this more than fairy land; and especially is this true of the eastern side of the bay. You can go over by steamer any hour in the day you please; and if you go once, you will be sure to go several times.
</p><p>
Oakland is the first town over the bay you will prefer to visit. It stands in about the same relation to San Francisco that Brooklyn does to
</p><p>
New York. It is, as a place of residence, one of the most delightful I ever saw. Many of the leading merchants and professional gentlemen, who do business in San Francisco, reside here, and have built themselves palatial dwellings, with spacious lawns, gardens and orchards attached. The streets are broad, airy, and cleanly as a park. In fact, the town is but a park highly cultivated and ornamented with all that is beautiful in nature and in art; contains about seven thousand inhabitants; is rapidly advancing, and has a liberal sprinkling of fine churches and excellent schools. The name, Oakland, has been given it because it is located in the midst of an extensive grove of native evergeen oaks. Among its best schools there is one conducted by individual enterprise, in which a full course of literary and military instruction is combined. It is popular, and enjoys a generous patronage. We visited it and witnessed the military drill of the pupils. The exercises were exceedingly interesting, and performed with an efficiency, accuracy, and soldier-like bearing, that quite astonished us. It is a rare, good school.
</p><p>
Near Oakland, and on the same side of the bay, is Alameda, a rural town of ten or twelve hundred inhabitants, who reside in the midst of flower gardens and vineyards, and beautifully
cultivated farms, and seem to enjoy all that it is possible for an earthly paradise to afford. Alameda is, in fact, the "Garden of the State." The lands are level; the soil rich; the air pure and cool, yet summer-like the year round. It is distinguished for its numerous orchards of apples, pears, peaches and other fruits, as well as for its fine vineyards. Indeed every kind of fruit and vegetable that can be desired, grows here in great perfection and abundance. The live oak is scattered over the plain, giving to the entire region the appearance of being an old apple orchard, for the reason that this species of oak looks exactly like an aged appletree. This grove land is called in the Spanish language the "Encinal." Yet it is a cultivated land of fruits and flowers and happy homes.

While here we were entertained at the house of a friend, who is a distinguished lawyer, doing business in San Francisco. He has an accomplished lady for a wife, and a fine family of promising children, almost "too numerous to mention," and is evidently one of the happiest men alive, amid all his cares and responsibilities. His house is a spacious one, furnished in modern style, and located in a ten-acre garden, which is cultivated to a high degree in all that is not only useful, but rare and beautiful. It was late in October when
we were there, and at that time apples and pears had ripened and fallen to the ground, and were so abundant that they could neither be sold nor given away. We passed orchards in which there were thousands of bushels of apples and pears lying on the ground and going to decay; the very best, largest and finest fruit I ever saw. It was a pitiful sight. But we were told that it cost more to send them to market than they would bring, though the distance by rail and steamer to San Francisco is only twelve miles. It seems almost incredible that such a waste of fruit should be permitted so near a large city, where it could be sold at moderate prices, were not the freights so exhorbitant. It is evident that California needs an increase of transportation facilities.

The little village of Hayward, twenty-two miles south-east of San Francisco, is somewhat noted for its hot springs, which are medicinal and often visited by invalids. The village is cheaply built, with small frame buildings, standing two or three feet high from the ground, on wooden blocks or stilts. The earthquake of October 21st, 1868, destroyed, it was said, most of the town. The buildings were not in fact destroyed, but merely thrown from their legs to the ground. It was a sort of a vibrating wrestle with an earthquake, which the denizens did not much relish.
</p><p>
Everybody was frightened, but nobody hurt. Yet it was one of the most violent shocks of earthquake known on this part of the Pacific coast for many years. It was severely felt at several points. The electrical currents, or forces, seemed to move in belts. In an extensive meadow, at Alameda, the earth opened for several miles in a direction at right angles with a board fence, and closed up with such violence as to leave a ridge in the soil, resembling a double furrow turned by a plow. The fence at the point of intersection parted, and was no where else disjointed; but in the re-action did not reach its original position by two feet. Some one has more land there, now, than he purchased. Whose is it?
</p><p>
The shocks of the earthquake were more destructive in San Francisco than elsewhere. The currents of electricity passed in two distinct belts through the city. The range of the belts, or tracks, were nearly parallel, as marked by the damage that was done. In the business part of the city the walls of the brick buildings were in many instances cracked, or shattered, while some were prostrated in ruins, killing a few persons outright, and terrifying the citizens generally. The first shock occurred about the usual breakfast hour. This was the severest, and did not prove a desirable appetizer. The fashionables,
who board at hotels and sleep late in the morning, sprang from their beds and ran into the streets without making their toilettes, and enacted such a comedy as was never before witnessed. Every street was a theatre, and crowded to overflowing--seats free--yet every one was puzzled in knowing when to applaud. The ridiculous scenes which occurred, however, have been remembered, and will never cease to be the subject of merriment. And yet an earthquake is a serious matter. A Franklin disarmed the lightning, but who shall disarm the earthquake? Science may yet do it. Nothing is impossible.
