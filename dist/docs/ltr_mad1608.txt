DEAR SIR, No question, direct or indirect, has yet been 
taken by which the state of parties could be determined. Of 
course, each is left to enjoy the hopes resulting from its own 
partial calculations. It is probable the majority on either side 
will not exceed 3, 4, 5, or 6. I indulge a belief that at this 
time the friends of the Constitution have the advantage in point 
of number. Great moderation, as yet, marks our proceedings. 
Whether it be the effect of temper, or of the equality of forces 
and the uncertainty of victory, will be seen by the event. We 
</p><p>
are at present on the Executive Department. Mr. H y has 
</p><p>
not made any opposition to it, though it was looked for. He 
may, however, still mean to make one, or he may lay by for an 
exertion against the Judiciary. 
</p><p>
I find myself not yet restored, and extremely feeble. 
</p><p>
With my affect 6 regards, I remain, yrs.
