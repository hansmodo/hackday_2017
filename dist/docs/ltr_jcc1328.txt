</p><p>
SIR: Agreeably to your request, I herewith return the copy of a letter signed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="me">William H. Crawford</a>, which I received under cover of your note of this 
instant, handed to me this morning by Mr. Donelson, of which I have retained a copy, in conformity with your permission. 
</p><p>
As soon as my leisure will permit, you shall receive a communication from 
me on the subject to which it refers. In the mean time, I cannot repress 
the expression of my indignation at the affair; while, at the same time, I can 
not but express my gratification that the secret and mysterious attempts 
which have been making, by false insinuations, for years, for political purposes, to injure my character, are at length brought to light. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
To the PRESIDENT of the United States.
