Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Mr. Sands delivered me your favour of the 4th inst. 
yesterday. It gave me much pleasure. The length, the 
subject, and the spirit of it pleased me : unless the pain my 
last occasioned was severe, I don't regret it. That vou 
have deserved well of your country is confessed, and that 
you became latterly a little relaxed is not disputable. You 
have never been thrown out or distanced in the pursuit of 
virtue ; but, like some game horses, you sometimes want 
the whip. This is a coarse simile. Friendship will pardon it. 
</p><p>
That full confidence which induced you to think loud, 
natters me. The like returns are due, and shall be paid. 
But letters in our davs are dangerous convevances of our 
sentiments on many subjects. I seldom write without 
adverting to the consequences of miscarriage ; and hence 
the reserve and caution which mark all such of mine as are 
trusted to common carriers, or doubtful bearers. 
</p><p>
The state of your politics is much as I expected. I fear 
some of your measures are more severe than wisdom or 
humanity will justify. Posterity will think dispassionately, 
and probably condemn, especially when informed that they 
were hastened lest the influence of resentment should be lost. 
</p><p>
My silence on a certain subject arose from reflecting that 
an explanation ought not to be on paper. The probability 
of it turns on an event not yet determined. If I discern 
right, there will be room. 
We shall be exceedingly happy to see you. I hope your 
visit will not be delayed longer than the mads may render 
necessary; and manage matters so as to stay here at least 
a month. I am, dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Your friend and servant, 
</p><p>
