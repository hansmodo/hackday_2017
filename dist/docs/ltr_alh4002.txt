My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I enclose you copies of two resolutions which have passed 
the House of Representatives of Virginia. Others had 
been proposed and disagreed to. But the war was still 
going on. A spirited remonstrance to Congress is talked of. 
</p><p>
This is the first symptom of a spirit which must either 
be killed, or will kill the constitution of the United States. 
I send the resolutions to you, that it may be considered 
what ought to be done. 
</p><p>
Ought not the collective weight of the different parts of 
the government to be employed in exploding the principles 
they contain ? This question arises out of sudden and undigested thought. 
</p><p>
I remain, dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>.

" Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that 
so much of the act of Congress entitled 'An act making 
provision for the debt of the United States' as assumes the 
payment of the State debts, is repugnant to the constitution of the United States, as it goes to the exercise of a 
power not expressly granted to the general government. 
</p><p>
"Resolved, That so much of the act entitled 'An act 
making provision for the debt of the United States' as hinits 
the right of the United States in their redemption of the 
public debt is dangerous to the rights and subversive of the 
interests of the people, and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly."
