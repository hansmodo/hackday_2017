Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I am in possession of all the news up to date, the 
passage of the impeachment, resolution, etc., but I yet 
don't know if the nomination of T. Ewing, Senior, was a 
real thing or meant to compromise a difficulty. 
</p><p>
The publication of my short note of January 18th, is 
nothing to me. I have the original draft which I sent 
through Grant's hands, with his endorsement back to 
me. At the time this note must have been given to the 
reporter, the President had an elaborate letter from me, 
in which I discussed the whole case, and advised against 
the very course he has pursued, but I don't want that 
letter or any other to be drawn out to complicate a case 
already bad enough. 
</p><p>
You may always safely represent me by saying that 
I will not make up a final opinion till called on to 
act, and I want nothing to do with these controversies 
</p><p>
The trouble which President Johnson had been having with Mr. 
Stanton ended in the appointment of General Lorenzo Thomas as Secretary of War ad interim. This resulted in the articles of impeachment 
and trial of the President before the Senate. The final vote showed 
less than two-thirds for conviction, and so the President was acquitted. 
Mr. Stanton resigned, and General Schofield was made Secretary of 
War. 
</p><p>
until the time comes for the actual fight, which I hope 
to God may be avoided. If the Democratic party intend 
to fight on this impeachment, which I believe they do 
not, you may count 200,000 men against you in the 
South. The negroes are no match for them. On this 
question, the whites there will be more united than 
on the old issue of Union and Secession. I do not 
think the President should be suspended during trial, 
and if possible, the Republican party should not vote on 
all side questions as a unit. They should act as judges, 
and not as partisans. The vote in the House, being a 
strictly party vote, looks bad, for it augurs a prejudiced 
jury. Those who adhere closest to the law in this crisis 
are the best patriots. Whilst the floating politicians here 
share the excitement at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, the people generally manifest little interest in the game going on at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
