My dear General, 
</p><p>
On my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I have been so friendly 
received, that no words can express my truly affectionate gratitude. To these enjoyments I have added 
the heartfelt pleasure to contemplate the effect a sudden appearance of your picture had upon a people, 
whose love to you is as great at least as in any 
part of the world. Circumstanced as I am, I could 
not, with any propriety, set out so soon as I expected. I am sorry our meeting again is deferred ; but, 
when you are absent, I endeavour to guess what you 
would haA^e advised me to do, and then do it. I am 
sure you would advise my staying here some time 
longer. I therefore will not go until the 1st or 2d 
of next month, and then I embark from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in 
the Nymph frigate to go to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. M, de 
Grandchain, who commands her, begs to be respectfully remembered to you ; and as he expects reaching 
York about the 8th or 10th, he will, in company with 
me, wait upon you wherever you ma}'' be found. 
</p><p>
The bearer I send to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, in order 1 
may receive your commands at the moment I arrive. 
So late in the season, I think you will advise my 
going immediately to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. I â€¢ hope you will 
let me know where we are to meet ; and I also hope, 
my dear General, you will not deny my affectionate, 
pressing request, to induce your visiting with me our 
friends in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
The Chevalier's respects and mine wait upon Mrs. 
Washington, and wish to be remembered to all the 
family. Adieu, my dear General. With the most 
affectionate and devoted sentiments of filial love and 
respect, I have the honor to be, yours, &c.,
