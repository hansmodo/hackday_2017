GENTLEMEN : The signal honour conferred on me by the General Assembly in their choice of me to be Governor of this commonwealth, demands my 
best acknowledgments, which I beg the favour of you to convey to them in the most acceptable manner. 
</p><p>
I shall execute the duties of that high station, to which I am again called by the favor of my 
fellow-citizens, according to the best of my abilities, and I shall rely upon the candour and wisdom of the Assembly, to excuse and supply my defects. 
The good of the commonwealth shall be the only object of my pursuits, and I shall measure my happiness according to the success which shall attend my 
endeavours to establish the public liberty. I beg to be presented to the Assembly ; and that they and 
you will be assured, that I am with every sentiment of the highest regard, their and your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
