My dear General, 
</p><p>
It appears that an Engineer Officer is to be detailed for duty in Oregon, to report to you & accompany you on your march next Spring ; as 
I am quite tired of civilization, and am very anxious to go with you, I take the liberty of 
asking you whether you would have any objection to having me in that position I take it for granted that if there is any other Engr. Officer 
whom you would prefer, that you will tell me at once, & I ll have no more to say on the subject. Gibbs tells me that you are going to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> 
as soon as the Sectry. of War returns, will I be asking too much of you, if you are willing to have me, in requesting you to apply to the Sectry 
and to Gen. Totten for me. I do not suppose that there will be very many applicants for Oregon, so that I anticipate little or no difficulty in the matter. I suppose that I shall have to go in that 
direction anyhow at some period during the next 10 or 15 years, and I should prefer going now whilst young & having the disposition to lead an active life. 
</p><p>
I can t say how much I ll be obliged to you, General, if you will push the matter & take me with you " for better & worse." 
</p><p>
Your namesake, whose name you never could remember, is still here, and well. 
</p><p>
Everyone here says that you must come on to see us, I know that you would be pleased to see something of the Academy, & you will find here some of the " Old Division." 
</p><p>
Please give my best respects to Mrs. Smith and believe me to be 
</p><p>
your most obdt servant 
</p><p>

Lt of Engrs.
