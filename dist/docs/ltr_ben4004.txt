Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received a letter from a very respectable person 
in America, containing the following words, viz : â€” 
" It is confidently reported, propagated, and believed by 
some among us, that the Court of France was at bottom 
against our obtaining the fishery and territory, in that great 
extent in which both are secured to us by the treaty ; that 
our minister at that court favoured, or did not oppose, this 
design against us ; and that it was entirely owing to the 
firmness, sagacity, and disinterestedness of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a>, 
with whom <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> united, that we have obtained those 
important advantages." 
</p><p>
It is not my purpose to dispute any share of the honour 
of that treaty, which the friends of my colleagues may be 
disposed to give them ; but having now spent fifty years of 
my life in public offices and trusts, and having still one ambition left, that of carrying the character of fidelity, at least, 
to the grave with me, I cannot allow that I was behind any 
of them in zeal and faithfulness. I therefore think that I 
ought not to suffer an accusation, which falls little short of 
treason to my country, to pass without notice, when the 
means of effectual vindication arc at hand. You, sir, was 
a witness of my conduct in that allair. To you and my 
other colleagues I appeal, by sending to each a similar letter 
with this ; and I have no doubt of your readiness to do a 
brother-commissioner justice, by certificates that will entirely destroy the effect of that accusation. I have the 
honour to be, with much esteem, 
</p><p>
Sir, your most obedient, 
</p><p>
And most humble servant, 
</p><p>
