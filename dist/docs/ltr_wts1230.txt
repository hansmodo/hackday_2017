Dear Brother: ... I have been importuned from 
every quarter to write or say something about the 
"Depew" revelations, but have steadily refused anything for publication. But a few days ago Blaine wrote 
me confidentially, as he wanted information in the preparation of his second volume. I have answered him, sending copies of letters and papers from my private files, 
which I believe established these points. The attempt 
to send <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> along with Lew Campbell to 
Mexico in October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1866">1866</a>, had 110 connection with Congress's final quarrel with President Johnson, which did 
not happen till after January 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>, and then only 
because Grant allowed Stanton to regain his office as 
Secretary of War, after forcing him to contend for it in 
the courts. Indeed, Grant served in Johnson's Cabinet 
during Stanton's suspension, viz., from August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1867">1867</a>, to 
January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1868">1868</a>, and was, to my personal knowledge, on 
-friendly terms with Johnson. The real cause for their 
quarrel was that article in the "National Intelligencer," 
January 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1868">1868</a>, when four members of the Cabinet 
accused Grant of prevaricating and deceiving the President. I was present when Grant made his explanation 
of the whole case to Johnson, and I understood the latter 
to express himself as satisfied. But the newspapers kept 
it up, and made the breach final and angry. 
</p><p>
I do not believe that Johnson ever contemplated the 
use of force against Congress, and am equally sure that 
Grant, at the time, had no fear or apprehension of such 
a thing. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
