Another such day, and there is the end of me! Charlie decided to send Lilly and the children into 
the country early to-morrow morning, and get them 
safely out of this doomed town. Mother, Miriam, 
and I were to remain here alone. Take the children 
away, and I can stand whatever is to come; but this 
constant alarm, with five babies in the house, is too 
much for any of us. So we gladly packed their trunks 
and got them ready, and then news came pouring in. 
</p><p>
First a negro man just from the country told Lilly that our soldiers were swarming out there, that he 
had never seen so many men. Then Dena wrote us that a Mrs. Bryan had received a letter from her 
son, praying her not to be in <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> after Wednesday morning, as they were to attack to-morrow. 
Then a man came to Charlie, and told him that though he was on parole, yet as a Mason he must beg 
him not to let his wife sleep in town to-night ; to get her away before sunset. But it is impossible for her 
to start before morning. Hearing so many rumors, all pointing to the same time, we began to believe there 
might be some danger; so I packed all necessary clothing that could be dispensed with now in a large 
trunk for mother, Miriam, and me, and got it ready to send out in the country to Mrs. Williams. All told, 
I have but eight dresses left ; so I'll have to be particular. I am wealthy, compared to what I would have 
been Sunday night, for then I had but two in my sack, and now I have my best in the trunk. If the 
attack comes before the trunk gets off, or if the trunk is lost, we will verily be beggars; for I pack well, and 
it contains everything of any value in clothing.

The excitement is on the increase, I think. Everybody is crazy to leave town.
