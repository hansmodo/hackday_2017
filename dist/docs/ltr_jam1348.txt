DEAR SIR: I have received your letter of the 17th, and hasten to answer 
it. I well remember, that, when I received the letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, 
to which you allude, of the 16th of January r <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, I was sick in bed, and 
could not read it. You were either present, or came in immediately afterwards, and I handed it to you for perusal. After reading it, you replaced 
it, with a remark that it required my attention, or would require an answer; 
but without any notice of its contents. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> came in soon afterwards, and I handed it also to him for perusal. He read it, and returned it 
in like manner, without making any comment on its contents, further than 
that it related to the Seminole war, or something to that effect. I never 
showed it to any other person, and I am not certain whether it was he or 
you who observed that it related to the Seminole war. Having made all 
the arrangements respecting that war, and being some time confined by indisposition, the letter was laid aside and forgotten by me, and I never read it 
until after the conclusion of the war, and then I did it on an intimation, 
from you that it required my attention. You ask whether that letter was 
before the cabinet in the deliberation on the despatches received from the 
General, communicating the result of that war, or alluded to by any member in the administration. My impression decidedly is, that it was not before the cabinet, nor do I recollect or think that it was alluded to in the 
deliberation on the subject. Had it been, I could not, I presume, have forgotten it. I received the despatches referred to here, and had made up my 
mind before I left home as to the part I ought to take in reference to its 
management, especially if I should be supported in the opinion formed by 
the administration. That support was afforded it, and I pursued the course 
which my judgment dictated, with a view to the honor and interest of my 
country, and the honor of the General who commanded.

With sincere regard, I am, dear Sir, yours,
