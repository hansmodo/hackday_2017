</p><p>
  I have but a very small offering to make to you my dear Rosa on this important era of your life, but perhaps my prayers & good wishes may not be valueless to you, I wish we could have visited you in sending some fine beaux but alas the stern necessities of war forbid – I hope we shall see you very often when you come to Richmond
</p><p>
The girls regret very much that they were unable to go to you but at this season the difficulties of traveling are so great you must remember us affectionately to all especially your dear mother who I hope will now be induced to come to Richmond
</p><p>
That God may keep your union with all of bliss that earth can give is that prayer of yours affectionately
