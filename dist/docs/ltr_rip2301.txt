SIR,
</p><p>
Captain Wiley, of Learned's brigade, will hand you this. He brings
with him forty men, I believe as good as any in the army. 'Tis the
general's intention that Nixon's, Paterson's, and the late Learned's
brigades, shall each furnish a party of sixty. You will please, after
selecting the best men for your parties, to order all the rest (save
your own and commissary's guard) to join their corps, as they complain
the duty is hard above. Either Captain Williams or Spur must leave
you, as Captain Wiley will command the party from Learned's. If there
are three subs for each party exclusive of those from your own
regiment, you can detain the whole of the subs of other brigades or
not, as you like.
</p><p>
Kearsley has not yet joined. The general will review all your letters
in a day or two, and give them full answers.
</p><p>
I am your most obedient servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rip" rel="met">Richard Platt</a>, Aid-de-camp.
