. . . There is very little of interest to write of from 
this place, where we are probably stationed for some 
months, with no prospect of another action until the 
rainy season, when armies can march without dying 
of thirst. We do not expect peace, although as the 
Mexican Congress is now in session the question must 
soon be settled. It is perfectly healthy here, the nights 
quite cold. . . . Some of the customs of these people 
seem very strange. Their funeral ceremonies are at 
least remarkable. A few days since I observed a 
funeral procession with the body laid upon the bier, 
decorated with ostrich plumes, wax candles, etc., and 
in front of it were three fiddlers playing away as hard 
as they could scrape. Upon inquiring of Don Luis, 
a Mexican merchant, what it meant, he said they were 
Penablas. The Penablas are the remnant of an Indian 
tribe who occupy a portion of the city by themselves. 
They are civilized and a stranger would find it very 
difficult to distinguish them from the Mexicans. A 
few days ago I saw a woman, poor superstitious creature, going on her knees with a lighted candle in her 
hand. She crawled across the plaza and down a paved 
street in this way as far as I could see. It was undoubtedly a penance ordered by the padre.

Cock fighting is quite the rage among these semi- 
barbarians. Yesterday I rode into a cock pit, and you 
may imagine my astonishment when I beheld the old 
priest presiding, receiving the bets, and heeling the 
chickens, as putting on the iron spurs or slashers is 
technically called. I am told that this is nothing un 
common, that on any Sunday afternoon I may find 
them thus engaged.

I wish you could take a peep into my quarters. I 
have mentioned in a previous letter that I live in a 
store attached to the house of a very respectable man, 
Don Ramoon Flores, once Governor of the Depart 
ment. N - sleeps on one end of the counter and 
on the other I lay my bones at night. M - lives 
in the counting-room where also we set our table. 
Senor Flores is very polite and occasionally sends us 
a nice dish from his table, a bowl of delicious preserved 
grapes, or some excellent quince jam. The old gentle 
man is now absent at his hacienda, distant about 
thirty leagues. He has gone for his wife and daughters, 
who were sent there on the approach of our army. 
He has found that we treat them kindly, " the big 
scare " is over and he is not afraid to bring the young 
ladies back. He will probably return in four or five 
days, when, as I am quite a favorite, I intend seeing 
something of ladies society here, which I haven t yet 
had an opportunity to do. It is almost certain now 
that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> will make this his headquarters. 
. . . The General is now gone to Victoria where he 
will leave a strong force. General Wool is at Parras, 
ninety- two miles to the west with two thousand men. 
Lieutenant Franklin came in from that place yesterday and says they expect to be attacked there before 
long. (I don t believe they will.) The old year is fast 
passing. In twenty days it will have yielded its place 
to forty-seven ! . . .
