<p>
TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, March 19,<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1781">1781</a>;
</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
I have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency a copy of a letter from
General Greene, with some other intelligence received, not doubting your
anxiety to know the movements in the South.
</p><p>
I find we have deceived ourselves not a little, by counting on the whole
numbers of the militia which have been in motion, as if they had all
remained with General Greene, when, in fact, they seem only to have
visited and quitted him.
</p><p>
The Marquis Fayette arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a> on the 15th. His troops still
remained at the head of the bay, till the appearance of some force which
should render their passage down safe.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and
respect, your Excellency's
</p><p>
most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
</p>
