<p><i>[Biographer's note: The mails in those days were not very direct, and private messenger
was often the surest and speediest method of letter-carriage.  In the
absence of my mother, my father was trying to better the staff of
servants.  Their inefficiency was the drawback to our comfort then,
as it is now.  Often the recommendation of some was only the name of
the estate from which they came.  A few days later, my father writes

My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse met">Mary</a>:  I was glad to receive your note this morning, and
wish it could have reported a marked improvement in your health.  But
that, I trust, will come in time.  It has been impossible for me to
return to you this week, and, indeed, I do not see how I can absent
myself at all.  I shall endeavour to go to the Baths Monday, and hope
during the week you may be able to determine whether it would be more
advantageous for you to remain there or go further, as I shall have
to return here as soon as I can.  I can accomplish nothing while
absent.  Custis ahs determined to accompany Mr. Harris to the White
Sulphur Monday, and the girls seem indifferent about leaving home.
They ask, properly, what is to become of it?  Mr. Pierre Chouteau,
son of Julia Gratiot and Charles Chouteau, will hand you this.  He
will remain over Sunday at the Baths, and can tell you all about St.
Louis.  I send such letters as have come for you.  I have no news.
The heat seems to extend everywhere, but it will be cool enough after
a time.  We are as usual, except that 'Aunt' Caroline [the cook] seems
more overcome, and Harriet [the maid] indulges in lighter attire.  I
fear Mrs. Myers had an awful time.  The Elliotts do not seem in haste
to leave town.  They are waiting for a cool day to go to the Natural
Bridge, and do not seem to have decided whether to go to the Baths
or Alum Springs.  We had an arrival last night from the latter place--
General Colquit and daughters.  They return to-morrow.  The girls
will write of domestic matters.  I received a letter from Rob at
Romancoke.  He is still taking cholagogue, but well.  Nothing of
interest has occurred.
</p><p>
                    Affectionately yours,
</p><p>
                              <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>
