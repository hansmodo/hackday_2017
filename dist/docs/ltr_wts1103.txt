My Dear Brother : I see you are placed on the Committee 
of Foreign Relations, which is deemed a compliment. 
Since you are embarked in politics, I shall watch your 
course with deep interest, and of all things, I shall 
expect you to avoid localism and to act as a representative of a great developing nation rather than a mere 
emblem of the freaks and prejudices of a small constituency. The slavery question is forced on you in spite 
of yourself. Time and facts are accomplishing all you 
aim at, viz. the preponderance of the free over the slave 
States. This is so manifest that the politicians and 
people of the South feel it, and consequently are tetchy 
and morose. Of course, you will vote as you think 
right ; but should you have occasion to speak, do not 
imitate Giddings or Seward, but avoid the subject as a 
dirty black one. The repeal of the Compromise was unfortunate, but being done, to repeal it would only produce 
feeling and no good. Kansas will be a free State, so will 
Missouri and Kentucky in time ; but the way to accomplish that is to let things go on as now, showing the eminent prosperity of the free States, whilst the slave States 
get along slowly. Self-interest is the great motor, and 
the Kentuckians and Missourians, seeing the land and 
property of adjoining free States commanding a high, 
and ready price in consequence of the influx of white 
men, will feel that they have other interests beside slave 
property, and this cause is now telling, and will go on 
increasing. Therefore, to accomplish any political end, 
no provoking speeches are necessary, but on the contrary 
defeat the object in view. I think you may do yourself 
credit and a public good by aiding California and the 
Pacific coast, which is poorly represented. There are 
now Indian wars going on to the north of us that will 
appeal to you. Don't meddle in it. Let Oregon and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> Territories have reasonable help ; but they 
should help themselves, as Congress has donated to 
them liberally in the way of land, and these wars are 
doubtless provoked by the indiscriminate robbery of the 
Indians, who, driven from the valleys, find no alternative but to steal and kill. 
</p><p>
All the Pacific slope is mountainous, and the valleys 
are limited in extent. From these the Indians have been 
expelled, and of right they resist. The settlements have 
pushed forward more than the extent of the white population warrants, and they cannot be restrained, save by 
the danger of Indians, a proper and necessary restraint. 
</p><p>
The time for the great national railroad has not yet 
come. The surveys thus far made do not settle the 
question of the best route ; but my opinion is the old 
emigrant route from Fort Leavenworth or Council Bluffs 
is the best one. But the movement now on foot to open 
a good wagon road is very timely. Its cost will be comparatively small, as California will make one or more 
good roads across the Sierra Xevada. Some four or five 
military posts with settlements around them, some 
bridges and free ferries, will be all that is needed. Advocate the wagon road with all the zeal you possess, and 
you will do a good thing. A stage will use the wagon 
road as soon as the wants of the people demand. The 
great object to be accomplished is to afford convenient 
resting places, where the emigrant can buy a mule or ox 
and can have his wagon repaired at moderate cost. This 
post should be fortified in the strongest manner possible, 
and supplied in advance of any necessity with all the 
munitions of war. The engineer in chief will have made 
the necessary estimates, and you will be safe in advocating whatever he may recommend. 
</p><p>
Independent of gold, California is of great value to the 
Union by affording so good a harbor and point of commerce, from which we can trade with the Pacific Islands, 
with Mexico, and the Asiatic continent. The navy yard 
and docks now in process of building should be finished 
as soon as possible. I throw out these ideas to you, as I 
suppose you will admit my means of judging. 
Your affectionate brother,
