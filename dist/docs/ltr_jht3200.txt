SIR, 
</p><p>
I suppose your Excellency is not wholly unacquainted with the character of Mr. David Bushnell, 
the bearer. He has had a liberal education, and discovers a genius capable of great improvement, in mathematical ; philosophic, and mechanical literature. His 
inventions for annoying the enemy's shipping are new 
and ingenious, and, I trust, founded on such principles 
as would insure success. The vigilance practised in 
guarding the shipping has, I suppose, been the only 
means of preventing such execution as would have 
been attended with very alarming and beneficial con 
sequences. He has, with persevering and indefatigable industry, pursued the object with very little 
prospect of any other reward than that of serving 
his country. 
</p><p>
Misfortune and accident have prevented the execution of this design ; but there is reason to believe 
the explosion of one of his machines, taken on board 
one of the enemy's ships some time since, has greatly 
alarmed their marine, and made them very cautious 
in their approaches to any of the neighbouring shores. 
</p><p>
It is a pity that so promising a genius should 
not be encouraged. I understand an establishment of 
miners and sappers is forming under, your Excellency's direction, and would therefore take the liberty 
to propose to your Excellency, whether a person of 
his particular genius might not be very useful in 
that department. 
</p><p>
If you should not have filled, and cannot probably 
fill, the officers with gentlemen of greater merit and 
genius, permit me to recommend Mr. Bushnell to the 
office of Captain in that service, which, from his abilities, genius, and integrity, I should judge him capable to execute with honor and advantage. The Council 
of this State, now convened, join with me in this re 
commendation. I am, with very high respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
