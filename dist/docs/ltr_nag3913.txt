DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have this moment received your letter of the 23d inst. Since the 
letter written by Major Burnet yesterday, I have been informed that 
a fleet, consisting of one sloop-of-war, three galleys, three armed brigs, 
with ten empty sloops and schooners, having 500 infantry under Major 
Brewerton and Doyle on board, passed the bar of Charlestown early 
yesterday morning, destined for Santee and Cambahee, to collect rice. 
It was supposed they would divide the force nearly equal. I have no 
doubt but you will take measures to make them pay dearly for the rice 
they may collect on Santee. I am, dear sir, with esteem and regard^ 
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
