Sir, 
</p><p>
Flattering myself that your knowledge of me will 
induce you to receive the observations I make, as 
dictated by a regard to the public good, I take the 
liberty to suggest to you my ideas on some matters 
of delicacy and importance. I view the present juncture as a very interesting one. I need not observe 
how far the temper and situation of the army may 
make it so. The state of our finances was perhaps 
never more critical. I am under injunctions, which 
will not permit me to disclose some facts that would 
at once demonstrate this position; but I think it probable you will be possessed of them through another 
channel. It is, however, certain that there has scarcely 
been a period of the revolution which called more for from the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, on the 25th of November, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 
wisdom and decision in Congress. Unfortunately for 
us, we are a body not governed by reason or foresight, but by circumstances. It is probable we shall 
not take the proper measures; and, if we do not, a 
few months may open an embarrassing scene. This 
will be the case, whether we have peace or a continuance of the war. 
</p><p>
If the war continues, it would seem that the army 
must, in June, subsist itself to defend the country. If 
peace should take place, it will subsist itself to procure justice to itself. It appears to be a prevailing 
opinion in the army, that the disposition to recompense their services will cease with the necessity for 
them ; and that, if they once lay down their arms, 
they part with the means of obtaining justice. It is 
to be lamented that appearances afford too much 
ground for their distrust. 
</p><p>
It becomes a serious inquiry, What is the true line 
of policy ? The claims of the army, urged with moderation, but with firmness, may operate on those 
weak minds which are influenced by their apprehensions more than by their judgments, so as to produce 
a concurrence in the measures which the exigencies 
of affairs demand. They may add weight to the applications of Congress to the several States. So far 
a useful turn may be given to them. But the difficulty will be to keep a complaining and suffering 
army within the bounds of moderation. 
</p><p>
This your Excellency's influence must effect. In 
order to it, it will be advisable not to discountenance 
their endeavour to procure redress, but rather, by the 
intervention of confidential and prudent persons, to 
take the direction of them. This, however, must not 
appear; it is of moment to the public tranquillity 
that your Excellency should preserve the confidence of the army without losing that of the people. This 
will enable you, in case of extremity, to guide the 
torrent, and to bring order, perhaps even good, out 
of confusion. It is a part that requires address, but 
it is one which your own situation as well as the 
welfare of the community points out. 
</p><p>
I will not conceal from your Excellency a truth, 
which it is necessary you should know. An idea is 
propagated in the army, that delicacy, carried to an 
extreme, prevents your espousing its interests with 
sufficient warmth. The falsehood of this opinion no 
one can be better acquainted with than myself; but 
it is not the less mischievous for being false. Its 
tendency is to impair that influence which you may 
exert with advantage, should any commotions unhappily ensue, to moderate the pretensions of the army, 
and make their conduct correspond with their duty. 
</p><p>
The great desideratum at present is the establishment of general funds, which alone can do justice to 
the creditors of the United States (of whom the array 
forms the most meritorious class), restore public credit, and supply the future wants of Government. 
This is the object of all men of sense ; in this the 
influence of the army, properly directed, may cooperate. 
</p><p>
The intimations I have thrown out will suffice to 
give your Excellency a proper conception of my sentiments. You will judge of their reasonableness or 
fallacy ; but I persuade myself you will do justice to 
my motives. I have the honor to be, with great respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

P. S. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>General Knox</a> has the confidence of the army, and is a man of sense. I think he may be 
safely made use of Situated as I am, your Excellency will feel the confidential nature of these observations.
