It is a cool, beautiful evening and I am now seated on a log by the side of a fine blazing fire in front of our tent, giving the proceedings of the past three days.
<p></p>
The above picture will answer as a likeness of myself and will help to explain a miner's life. The likeness shows me fully equipped in the garb of a miner, with rough monkey coat, broad-brimmed California hat, and long, shaggy beard, as though not shaved for half a year, which is really the case. I am standing in a hole to the depth of my knees, with my pick raised high in the air; my spade and washbowl are lying upon the ground by my side. A little way off is Clint Atkins
working a cradle, and our partner pouring water, thus extracting the yellow ore from the worthless earth.
<p></p>
A little beyond, behold a tent, with the broad stripes and bright stars of our country's flag flying at its top. This is the outside of our home and I will endeavor to give a peep behind the curtain on the inside. The tent is nine feet square on the ground, running up to a ridgepole like the roof of a house. In the middle of the tent, on the ground, our blankets are spread; on the end pole our rifles are hanging; along the sides and in the corners are placed our provisionscoffee, tea, sugar, flour, pork, etc.and our knapsacks filled with clothing. Within this little house we eat, sleep, rest and tell each other good yarns. Just outside and rather behind the tent is a large rock. Here we build our fire and do our cooking and washing. All is endurable if it only pays well, but unfortunately it does not in many cases. The cooking and washing are the worst of all. That part is really detestable.

I have tried my hand at baking bread. After kneading up the dough, I took the frying pan, as we had no oven, and placed the dough in it, and turned a plate upside down over it. I then placed the pan on some good live coals and also covered the inverted plate over with them. It succeeded first-rate and we have feasted on soft bread.

Monday I passed the election ground twice but seeing no voting done did not stop. We finished our cradle and I went down the creek several miles again in search of another lot, abandoning the one I had pitched upon last and finding another nearer home. Yesterday McCowan and I dug a large trench through our lot but were prevented from getting down to the rock upon which the ore is deposited by the water coming in upon
us. Today we tried our washer at a small creek running near our tent and took out about one dollar in very fine dust. I heard of a man digging out $1,800 before breakfast, but this must be a stretch of the imagination.
<p></p>
This afternoon, finding we were in want of provisions and nearly out of funds, we resolved to get a supply on credit if possible. We succeeded, and lay in a stock amounting to $16. We also purchaseda small skillet, or stewpan, to supply the place of our kettle, for three dollars, and a few nails at $1.60 per pound.

I fell in with Mr. Speeden, chief mate of the Europe. He has been here about six weeks and made nothing. In coming up he had quite an adventure. He had packed his goods for Stockton and followed the train on foot. Starting one morning before the train was ready to move, he came to a creek and crossed it in a small boat and travelled on, supposing the train would soon overtake him; but when the train came up, it could not ford the river and had to go back about 12 miles to a ferry. Mr. Speeden, finding the train not likely to overtake him, sat down upon a rock and waited until towards evening, when it commenced snowing rapidly. He then moved on, hoping to get to some shelter before night set in, but in this he was disappointed. The snow was fast covering the trail he was following, when all at once he espied a huge grizzly bear within twenty feet of him. His first impulse was to fire into the bear, but his rifle carrying a very small ball, he knew that that would be almost certain death, and therefore took a good look at the bear and turned his back upon him. In running away from him, he lost his path and, night coming on, he had to sleep in an old hollow tree.

Atkins is convalescent, and I hope will be very well in a few days.
