My Dear Brother: Enlistments in this part of the 
State now go on rapidly. Dickey's regiment is nearly 
full, and companies have formed for cavalry and artillery 
regiments organizing in other parts of the State. It is 
also manifest a better feeling prevails among the people, 
a more hopeful and hearty support of the War and a 
readiness to bear its burdens. "When you remember that 
all these regiments are formed by voluntary enlistments, 
and for the war and under the shadow of defeat, it is wonderful so large a force is raised. As winter approaches 
more will enlist, for employment in civil pursuits will be 
out of the question. Want is as good a recruiting sergeant as patriotism. If, however, voluntary enlistments 
fail, then drafting must be resorted to. It is the fairest 
and best mode, for it makes all classes contribute alike. 
I have been at a loss what to do with myself this fall. 
</p><p>
I dislike the idea of being idle in these stirring times. 
My relations with Gov. Dennison are not such as will 
justify me in asking the organization of a regiment, and 
I will not undertake it without carte blanche as to officers. I notice from the papers that he has adopted 
somewhat such a plan of enlistment as I suggested to 
him. If he asks me to assist to execute it, I will do so at 
once and actively, but I presume he will not do so. As 
to making speeches through the State, it is very irksome. 
And this is not all. Speeches from me unless I enlist or 
am in the service myself will not come with a good grace. 
My speeches would be regarded as political. There is no 
disposition this fall to gather in mass meetings to hear 
speeches. It is probable I will take some part in the 
canvass for the Union Ticket, but after the election I will 
go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> and seek some active employment until 
after Congress meets. The delay in Kentucky appears 
ominous. The whole character of the State is reversed 
in this contest. The Kentuckians have always had the 
reputation of being ready fighters, and as Kentucky has 
taken position for the Union I should think they would 
at once take arms. Eastern Kentucky is the loyal part. 
All the counties between Ohio and East Tennessee have 
been considered thoroughly loyal. If civil war does 
break out in Kentucky, it seems to me that it must be in 
the Western part of the State, and then Paducah, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=madison" rel="city">Madison</a>, Ind., and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> will be the place for you. . . . 
Affectionately Yours,
