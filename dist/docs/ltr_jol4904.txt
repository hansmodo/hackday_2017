My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Mr. Forsyth, the bearer of this, takes charge of 
four packets for you, two of which I received yesterday and two to-day. He has likewise two other 
packets for other members of Congress, one of them 
directed to your care. I have desired him in case of 
your removal from Reading to call on <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker'>General Mifflin</a> 
who will have the letters forwarded. We shall move 
towards <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to-day, as the weather is fair 
and our reinforcements are at some distance below, 
ready to fall in with us. Yesterday, the enemy 
halted at Chestnut Hill, not far from Germantown, 
and there was a cannonading heard in the morning 
down the river. I am your most affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
