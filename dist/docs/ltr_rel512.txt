...I hope from the tone of your letter that you feel better, and
wish I could see you and be with you.  I trust we may meet this fall
somewhere, if only for a little time.  I have written to Robert telling
him if, after considering what I have previously said to him on the
subject of his joining the company he desires under Major Ross, he
still thinks it best for him to do so, I will not withhold my consent.
It seems he will be eighteen; I thought seventeen.  I am unable to
judge for him and he must decide for himself.  In reply to a recent
letter from him to me on the same subject, I said to him all I could.
I pray God to bring him to the right conclusion....  For military news,
I must refer you to the papers.  You will see there more than ever
occurs, and what does occur the relation must be taken with some
allowance.  Do not believe anything you see about me.  There has been
no battle, only skirmishing with the outposts, and nothing done of
any moment.  The weather is still unfavourable to us.  The roads, or
rather tracks of mud, are almost impassable and the number of sick
large....
