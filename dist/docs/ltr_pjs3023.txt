DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote you from <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, I have not been 
able to learn what is become of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> 
and the enemy. The army followed the troops that 
came to Skenesborough as far as Fort Ann, where 
they were yesterday repulsed ; notwithstanding which, 
Colonel Long, contrary to my express orders, evacuated that post, I am here, at the head of a handful of men, not above fifteen hundred, without provisions, little ammunition, not above five rounds to 
a man, having neither ball, nor lead to make any; 
the country in the deepest consternation ; no carriages to move the stores from Fort George, which I 
expect every moment to learn is attacked. And 
what adds to my distress, is, that a report prevails 
that I had given orders for the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, whereas not the most distant hint of such an 
intention can be drawn from any of my letters to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, or any other person whatever. 
I am informed, from undoubted authority, that the 
garrison was reenforced with twelve hundred men at 
least two days before the evacuation, and that eighty 
head of cattle had got in, and a number of sheep. 
What could induce the General Officers to a step 
that has ruined our affairs in this quarter, God only 
knows. 
</p><p>
By the information of some of the prisoners I 
learn, that the enemy have already a brigade on the 
w r ay from Skenesborough to this place. General Nixon's is not yet come up ; but, if it does, we shall 
still be too weak to make any capital opposition. I 
will, however, throw as many obstructions in the enemy's route as possible. A party is parading to fell 
trees across the road between this and Fort Ann, to 
take up all the bridges, drive off all the cattle, and 
bring away the carriages. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency a proclamation of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'><a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a></a>, which he has caused to be industriously 
spread through the country, and, I fear, will be at 
tended with the most evil consequences to us. I am, 
dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
