<p>
TO GENERAL C. SCHURZ.

</p><p>
BRIGADIER-GENERAL SCHURZ, Mount Jackson, Virginia:
</p><p>
Your long letter is received. The information you give is valuable.
You say it is fortunate that Fremont did not intercept Jackson; that
Jackson had the superior force, and would have overwhelmed him. If
this is so, how happened it that Fremont fairly fought and routed him
on the 8th? Or is the account that he did fight and rout him false
and fabricated? Both General Fremont and you speak of Jackson having
beaten Shields. By our accounts he did not beat Shields. He had no
engagement with Shields. He did meet and drive back with disaster
about 2000 of Shields's advance till they were met by an additional
brigade of Shields's, when Jackson himself turned and retreated.
Shields himself and more than half his force were not nearer than
twenty miles to any of it.
