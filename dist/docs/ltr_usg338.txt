DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
I have ordered a sixty days' furlough for Samuel A. He can be
discharged at any time after his return home. It will take probably
three weeks for my directions to reach him and for him to return.
</p><p>
I have just returned from Philadelphia leaving Mr. Cramer there. He can
describe our new house to you when he returns. My health is good but I
find so much to do that I can scarcely keep up with public business,
let alone answering all the private letters I receive. My going to
Philadelphia and spending half my time there as I hope to do, will give
me some leisure. I attend to public business there by telegraph and
avoid numerous calls taking up much time, or hope to do so.
</p><p>
My kind regards to all at home. I hope to hear of Mother's entire
recovery soon.
</p>
ULYSSES.
