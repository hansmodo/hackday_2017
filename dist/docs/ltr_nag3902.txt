DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 8th was handed me yesterday. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Lieut. Colonel Laurens</a> has given me an account of the enemy's last movement, and 
Gen. Leslie has explained the object to me in a letter, a copy of which 
I inclosed to you in my last. With respect to the incorporation of Horry's and Maham's corps, I have said all upon it that I can say. If 
you cannot effect the incorporation upon the first plan, pursue your 
second; and if you cannot accomplish that, employ the force in any 
manner you can most for the benefit of the service, and in a way most 
pleasing to the officers. The schooner that went to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> for 
rice has the Governor's pass, and not mine; however, be it one or the 
other, tell Col. Horry not to let the cutter have anything to do with 
her; and if they attempt to carry her away by force, to repel force by 
force. Whatever position you take with your troops, it will be necessary frequently to change it, which will keep the enemy in the dark, 
and prevent their enterprising anything against you. Should the 
enemy move out after you, our cavalry shall form a junction with 
you at the place you mention, or any other you may advise, upon the 
spur of the occasion. Col. Pinckney has arrived in camp. With 
esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
