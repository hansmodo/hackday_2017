SIR, 
</p><p>
The accounts you have given me are very satisfactory, and I doubt not every proceeding under your direction will be the 
same. I beg the favor of you to report whether the route you 
have marched will be practicable with a large corps of cannon, 
without repair, or with what sort of repair. The desirable circumstance for your corps is, at present, to possess <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a> ; 
but should you find the enemy too strongly posted, and maintaining such a countenance as would make a coup de main ardous, I wish you to take such a post as you can maintain till you 
hear further from me ; and upon your reports and other circumstances, I will either support you in force or withdraw you. 
</p><p>
You will please to send to my camp, as soon as you can, wagons and draught-cattle, and likewise such other cattle as are not 
necessary for your subsistence. Let the wagons and carts bring 
off what flour and wheat they can, that you do not retain for the 
same purpose. I will write to you in full to-morrow in regard to 
purchasing horses out of the hands of the savages. In the mean 
time, let them be assured that whatever you select from them, fit 
to mount the dragoons, shall be paid for at proper price. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
