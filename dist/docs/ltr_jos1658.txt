I was infinitely rejoiced to see in this morning's paper 
the announcement that you were to command at Cairo. 
I sincerely hope it is true, [if so, you will have a_noble 
opportunity to answer those who have belied you. Take 
my advice, be hopeful, cheerful, polite to everybody, 
even a newspaper reporter.J They are in the main, clever, 
intelligent men, a little too pressing in their vocation. 
</p><p>
Above all things, be hopeful and push ahead. Active, 
bold, prompt, vigorous action is now demanded. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> is dead in the estimation of even military men. . . . 
</p><p>
Do not the cheers with which our gun-boats were 
received in Tennessee and Alabama show you what I 
have always contended, that this rebellion is a political 
one, managed by " Southern gentlemen " and not grounded 
in the universal assent of the people ? Johnson has now 
more adherents in Tennessee than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff. Davis</a>. Let our 
leading army officers who have been educated to defend 
the nation catch the spirit of our people, a generous, 
hopeful, self-sacrificing spirit. Let them go ahead and 
you will find the Union restored and strengthened by its 
trials. . . . Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
