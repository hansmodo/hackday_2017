My Dear Fitzhugh:  I was very glad to receive, by the last packet
from Richmond, your letter of the 22d.  We had all been quite anxious
to hear from you, and were much gratified to learn that you were all
well, and doing well.  It is very cheering to me to hear of your good
prospects for corn and your cheerful prospects for the future.  God
grant they may be realised, which, I am sure, they will be, if you
will unite sound judgement to your usual energy in your operations.
As to the indictments, I hope you, at last, may not be prosecuted.  I
see no other reason for it than for prosecuting ALL who ever engaged
in the war.  I think, however, we may expect procrastination in measures
of relief, denunciatory threats, etc.  We must be patient, and let them
take their course.  As soon as I can ascertain their intention toward
me, if not prevented, I shall endeavour to procure some humble, but
quiet, abode for your mother and sisters, where I hope they can be
happy.  As I before said, I want to get in some grass country, where
the natural product of the land will do much for my subsistence....
Our neighbours are very kind, and do everything in the world to promote
our comfort.  If Agnes is well enough, I propose to ride up to 'Bremo'
next week.  I wish I was near enough to see you.  Give much love to
Rob and Johnny, the Carters and Braxtons.  All here unite in love and
best wishes for you all.
</p><p>
                             Most affectionately, your father,
</p>
