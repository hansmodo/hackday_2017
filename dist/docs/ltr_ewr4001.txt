My dear Jay, 
</p><p>
It is a long time since we have had any correspondence, 
but I see no reason why it should be longer, when we have 
any thing to say, and leisure to say if, in. Such is just my 
situation ; for it is Christmas-day, and all the world (i. e. 
my clients) being either at their devotions or their amusements, I have time to tell you, and I fear with some 
reason (as it comes north about), that a damned infamous 
cabal is forming against our commander-in-chief, and that 
whenever they shall find themselves strong enough they 
will strike an important blow. I give you this hint, that 
you may be on your guard ; and I know you will excuse me 
for doing so, when you recollect that there are some men 
of our acquaintance who are in possession of all the qualities of the devil, his cunning n< >t excepted. Recollect the 
indirect attempts that were repeatedly made against the 
command and reputation of poor Schuyler, and the fatal 
stab that was at last aimed at both; and let us be taught 
how necessary it is to oppose a cabal in its infancy. Were 
it in my power, I would stifle it in its birth. Conway, the 
****, and ******* are said to be at the bottom of this, 
besides an abundance of snakes that are concealed in the 
grass. If these are not encouraged to come forward, they 
will continue where they are ; but if the former are permitted to bask in the sunshine of Congressional favour, the 
latter will soon spread themselves abroad, and an extended 
field will be immediately occupied by the factious and 
the ambitious. The fate of America will then be like the 
fate of most of the republics of antiquity, where the designing have supplanted the virtuous, and the worthy have been 
sacrificed to the views of the wicked. Indeed, my friend, 
if the Congress do not embrace every opportunity to extinguish that spirit of cabal and unworthy ambition, it will 
finally be more essentially injurious to the well-being of 
this continent than the sword of Sir Harry and his whole 
army. I view the body of which we were for a long time 
members, as possessing, in a very eminent degree, the 
powers of good and evil. It depends on those who manage 
the machine to determine its object. I hear you have 
returned to Congress, and I hope you will have your full 
share in the management. I do not know what gentleman 
we shall send from this State. We have some fine plants, 
nay, saplings, that will do wondrous well in a few years, 
but are too tender at present to bear up the weight of this 
continent. Were it now to be imposed upon them, it might 
check their growth, or, as they are the production of a 
southern clime, it is possible they might be blighted by a 
northern wind. When you write me, let me know how 
Robert R. Livingston is. Remember me to him, for I 
esteem him highly. God bless you, my dear Jay, and 
believe me to be, with great sincerity, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend,
