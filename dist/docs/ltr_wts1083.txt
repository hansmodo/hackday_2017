Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
It appears that although you were pleased with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> as a city, you were not with the visit, taken all 
in all. From this I judge that your speculations did not 
turn out as well as expected. You must not be astonished if I say that if such be the case I am glad of it, 
because, had you succeeded, your attention would have 
been turned from your present business, with your success in which so many are interested. I presume by 
this time you must be nearly done with the works on the 
Muskingum. Those dams and locks of which you have 
spoken will no doubt be some of the finest specimens of 
workmanship in Ohio, and the more I think of it, the 
more I regret that I did not go and see them last summer. By the arrangement I suppose steamboats will be 
able to go up as far as Zanesville. I presume you have 
heard of these Maine difficulties before now. All is now 
calm in that quarter, the troops having been withdrawn 
from the disputed territory by both parties, and as far as 
our Government is concerned the thing is in a fair way of 
being amicably adjusted, but doubts are entertained with 
regard to the course which England will adopt. All 
anxiously await the return of the steamship Great Western which carried out the news, and as the time of her 
usual return has passed by several days, it is supposed 
that the time of her departure from England had been 
delayed in order to receive the news by the ship Liverpool, that left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> about eight or ten days after 
her ; and as among the latter were the proceedings of 
Congress and the President's message, there is every 
.reason to expect by this vessel some decisive news, and 
if they are ready for war, I think we will soon be. For 
my part, there is no nation that I would prefer being at 
variance with than the British, in this case more especially as our cause is plainly right and just. If anything 
occurs soon, I will write again or send the paper containing it. ... 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother,
