Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your grandson, whom it gave me great pleasure to see, 
delivered to me a few days ago your kind letter of the 21st 
of last month. Your being again with your family, the 
manner in which the French court parted with you, the 
attention you experienced from your English friends, and 
the reception you met with from your fellow-citizens, are 
circumstances that must give you great satisfaction. 
</p><p>
It strikes me that you will find it somewhat difficult to 
manage the two parties in Pennsylvania. It is much to be 
wished that union and harmony may be established there, 
and if you accomplish it. much honour and many blessings 
will result from it. Unless you do it, I do not know who 
can ; for, independent of experience and talents, you possess 
their confidence, and your advice and measures must derive 
very great weight from the reputation and consideration 
you enjoy. 
</p><p>
We are happy to find that you think of visiting NewYork. By the road from Burlington and Amboy, which is 
smooth and but short, you might doubtless come with very 
little inconvenience ; especially as you may travel at your 
leisure, and take as many days for it as your ease and the 
weather may require. Mrs. Jay is exceedingly pleased 
with this idea, and sincerely joins with me in wishing to see 
it realized. Her attachments are strong, and that to you, 
being founded in esteem and the recollection of kind offices, 
is particularly so. I suspect your little friend has forgotten 
your person. Your name is familiar to her, as, indeed, it 
will be to every generation. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
