DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote you on the 10th and 22d of November, 
and on the 13th of December last, and not having 
been honored with a line in answer to either of those 
letters, I begin to fear you have not duly received 
them, wherefore I take the liberty to inclose duplicates. I likewise inclose the proceedings of a General 
Court-Martial on the trial of Lieutenant Arthur Gor 
don, Adjutant of the ninth Virginia regiment, and a 
return of the provisions in store. 
</p><p>
I have not seen Colonel George Morgan since I 
came to this department; neither have I seen the 
Deputy Quartermaster-General since last March. I 
have not a tent for my men, and, by the inclosed 
return, you will see that the provisions are scanty ; 
but I hope to be better supplied in the spring. 
</p><p>
I have frequently given the most pointed orders 
respecting the public craft, notwithstanding which, 
the greatest part is, or will be, carried away with 
the ice. What I could retain at this place I did, 
and secured it by hauling it upon land. If the officers commanding at the different posts had taken the 
same care, little or none would have been driven off. 
Such a deep snow and such ice have not been known 
at this place in the memory of the oldest natives. 
Deer and turkeys die by hundreds for want of food. 
The snow on the Alleghany and Laurel Hills is four feet deep. 
</p><p>
By one of our prisoners, who lately made his 
escape from the Wyandots, and who has frequently 
been at Detroit, I am informed that the new fort 
erected there has two bomb-proofs of wood ; that the 
walls are very high, fifteen feet thick, and made offascines and clay ; that the barracks are sunk some 
distance into the ground, and that their roofs cannot 
be seen from without; that it stands on a fine commanding piece of ground, with a gentle descent each 
way ; likewise that it is surrounded by a ditch twenty feet wide. The garrison consists of four hundred 
and fifty regulars, and the enemy have eighteen hundred men at Niagara, besides a great number of Indians. If this intelligence is true, unless some di 
version is occasioned by troops marching up the Susquehanna River, it is not improbable that the enemy 
may pay us a visit down the Alleghany Paver next 
spring, and I have neither men nor cannon sufficient 
for this fort, unless a reenforcement can be spared 
from the main army. I shall, however, make the 
best disposition that circumstances will admit, and, if 
possible, gain further intelligence from the Delawares, 
who continue their declarations of friendship for us. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency will indulge me with twenty 
boat-builders, and some armourers, early in the spring. 
If I receive no orders to the contrary, and can be 
supplied with craft, I am determined to drive the Shawanese over the Lakes, which I can do before provi 
sions can be furnished for a capital expedition. 
</p><p>
I shall now transmit an estimate of cannon and 
military stores to the Board of War, in hopes that, 
by the time they arrive at this place, I shall be 
enabled to do something worthy the confidence you 
have placed in me. With the most exalted regard 
and esteem, I have the honor to be, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
DANIEL BHODHEAD.
