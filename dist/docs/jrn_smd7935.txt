They are coming! The Yankees are coming at last ! For four or five hours the sound of their cannon 
has assailed our ears. There ! that one shook my bed ! Oh, they are coming! God grant us the victory ! 
They are now within four miles of us, on the big road to <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>. On the road from town to 
<a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, we have been fighting since daylight at Readbridge, and have been repulsed. Fifteen gun 
boats have passed <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>, they say. It will be an awful fight. No matter! With God's help we ll conquer yet! Again! the report comes nearer. Oh, 
they are coming! Coming to defeat, I pray God.

Only we seven women remain in the house. The 
General left this morning, to our unspeakable relief. 
They would hang him, we fear, if they should find 
him here. Mass Gene has gone to his company; we 
are left alone here to meet them. If they will burn 
the house, they will have to burn me in it. For I 
cannot walk, and I know they shall not carry me. 
I m resigned. If I should burn, I have friends and 
brothers enough to avenge me. Create such a consternation ! Better than being thrown from a buggy 
only I d not survive to hear of it !

Letter from Lilly to-day has distressed me beyond 
measure. Starvation which threatened them seems 
actually at their door. With more money than they 
could use in ordinary times, they can find nothing to 
purchase. Not a scrap of meat in the house for a 
week. No pork, no potatoes, fresh meat obtained 
once as a favor, and poultry and flour articles unheard of. Besides that, Tiche crippled, and Margret very ill, while Liddy has run off to the Yankees. Heaven only knows what will become of them. 
The other day we were getting ready to go to them 
(Thursday) when the General disapproved of my 
running such a risk, saying he d call it a d - piece 
of nonsense, if I asked what he thought; so we remained. They will certainly starve soon enough 
without our help ; and yet I feel we should all be 
together still. That last superfluous word is the refrain of Gibbes's song that is ringing in my ears, and 
that I am chanting in a kind of ecstasy of excitement : 
</p><p>
"Then let the cannon boom as it will, We'll be gay and happy still! " 
</p><p>
And we will be happy in spite of Yankee guns! 
Only my dear This, That, and the Other, at 
Port Hudson, how I pray for your safety! God 
spare our brave soldiers, and lead them to victory! 
I write, touch my guitar, talk, pick lint, and pray so 
rapidly that it is hard to say which is my occupation. 
I sent Frank some lint the other day, and a bundle of 
it for Mr. Halsey is by me. Hope neither will need 
it! But to my work again! 
Half-past One o clock, A.M. 
</p><p>
It has come at last! What an awful sound! I 
thought I had heard a bombardment before; but 
<a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> was child's play compared to this. At 
half-past eleven came the first gun at least the 
first / heard, and I hardly think it could have commenced many moments before. Instantly I had my 
hand on Miriam, and at my first exclamation, Mrs. Badger and Anna answered. All three sprang to 
their feet to dress, while all four of us prayed aloud. 
Such an incessant roar! And at every report the 
house shaking so, and we thinking of our dear soldiers, the dead and dying, and crying aloud for 
God's blessing on them, and defeat and overthrow to 
their enemies. That dreadful roar! I can't think 
fast enough. They are too quick to be counted. We 
have all been in Mrs. Carter's room, from the last 
window of which we can see the incessant flash of the 
guns and the great shooting stars of flame, which 
must be the hot shot of the enemy. There is a burning house in the distance, the second one we have seen 
to-night. For Yankees can't prosper unless they are 
pillaging honest people. Already they have stripped 
all on their road of cattle, mules, and negroes. 
</p><p>
Gathered in a knot within and without the win 
dow, we six women up here watched in the faint 
starlight the flashes from the guns, and silently wondered which of our friends were lying stiff and dead, 
and then, shuddering at the thought, betook our 
selves to silent prayer. I think we know what it is to 
</p><p>
"wrestle with God in prayer"; we had but one 
thought. Yet for women, we took it almost too 
coolly. No tears, no cries, no fear, though for the 
first five minutes everybody's teeth chattered violently. Mrs. Carter had her husband in Fenner's 
battery, the hottest place if they are attacked by 
the land force, and yet to my unspeakable relief she 
betrayed no more emotion than we who had only 
friends there. We know absolutely nothing; when 
does one ever know anything in the country? But 
we presume that this is an engagement between 
our batteries and the gunboats attempting to 
run the blockade. 
</p><p>
Firing has slackened considerably. All are to lie 
down already dressed; but being in my nightgown 
from necessity, I shall go to sleep, though we may 
expect at any instant to hear the tramp of Yankee 
cavalry in the yard.
