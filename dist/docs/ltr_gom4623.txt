Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of receiving your letter of the 16th. 
After the explanations contained in it, I shall not again recur 
to that of the 30th of August, and as it was that which decided 
me to leave France, I now resume my determination to re 
main here, and await the orders of my government. 
</p><p>
As to my personal opinions, Sir, they are of no importance 
in so serious an affair, but you may be sure, that I have never 
questioned the right of any people to govern themselves ac 
cording to their own pleasure. For these many years I have 
desired sincerely, that France might enjoy all the liberty and 
all the happiness possible ; and I am confident that I express 
the sentiments of the United States, in assuring you that in 
this wish all my countrymen unite. 
</p><p>
I have the honor, Sir, to renew my application for a pass 
port for the interior. In testifying to my rank, it will preserve 
me from the interruptions to which one is liable at the present 
time. I have the honor to be, &LC.
