I have barely time, my dearest friend and father, 
to say that my heart overflows with gratitude at the 
repeated proofs of your tender love ; and must defer 
answering your kind letters of the 6th and 10th , till 
my return from Count D'Estaing's fleet, where the 
General has thought proper to send me with dispatches. I must immediately prepare for my journey and voyage. I could wish that Mons r Le Comte 
were furnished with a proper number of intelliGen. coast pilots ; that as many pilot boats, schooners and other small swift sailing vessels were employed under 
the conduct of judicious seamen, to reconnoitre the enemy's fleet whenever it appears at sea, and give 
the French admiral the earliest account of their strength, &ca., as well as keep him constantly advised afterwards of all their motions. 
</p><p>
The movement of our army across the I^orth river, 
to make demonstration near ~N. York, may have a 
happy effect in preventing the English admiral from 
making his fleet so strong as he otherwise would. 
</p><p>
God protect you, my dear father.

JOHN LAURENS.
