Dear Brother : I see my name was used in the debate 
yesterday on Louisiana matters. 
</p><p>
Neither the President or Secretary of War ever consulted me about Louisiana matters. Sheridan received 
his orders direct from the Secretary of War and Adjutant-General Townsend, and started on telegraphic notice, 
writing me a short note stating the fact, and that the 
Secretary of War would explain to me. 
</p><p>
The latter sent me a copy of the orders and instructions by mail, which I received after General Sheridan 
had gone, and I simply acknowledged their receipt. 
</p><p>
I have all along tried to save our officers and soldiers 
from the dirty work imposed on them by the city authorities of the South ; and may, thereby, have incurred the 
suspicion of the President that I did not cordially sustain 
his force. My hands and conscience are free of any of 
the breaches of fundamental principles in that quarter. 
And I have always thought it wrong to bolster up weak 
State governments by our troops. We should keep the 
peace always ; but not act as bailiff constables and catch 
thieves. That should be beneath a soldier's vocation. If 
you want information of the conditions up the Red River, 
call for a report recently made by Lieutenant-Colonel 
Morrow, personally known to you. . . . 
</p><p>
As ever, your brother, 
</p><p>
