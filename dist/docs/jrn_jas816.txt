Capt. Fremont arrived at the fort with Kit Carson, told me that he was an officer of the U. S. and left a party behind in Distress and on foot, the few surviving Mules was packed only with the most necessary. I received him politely and his Company likewise as 40 15an old acquaintance. The next Morning I furnished them with fresh horses, & a Vaquero with a pack Mule loaded with Necessary Supplies for his Men. Capt Fremont found in my Establishment every thing what he needed, that he could travell without Delay. He could have not found it so by a Spaniard, perhaps by a great Many and with loosing a great deal of time. I sold him about 60 Mules & about 25 horses, and fat young Steers or Beef Cattle, all the Mules & horses got Shoed. On the 23d March, all was ready and on the 24th he left with his party for the U. States.

As an Officer of the Govt. it was my duty to report to the Govt., that Capt. Fremont arrived. Genl. Micheltorena dispatched Lieut. Col. Telles (afterwards Gov. of Sinaloa) with Capt., Lieut. and 25 Dragoons, to inquire what Captain Fremonts business was here; but he was en route as they arrive only on the 27th. From this time on Exploring, Hunting & Trapping parties has been started, at the same time Agricultural & Mechanical business was progressing from Year to year, and more Notice has been taken of my establishment. It became even a fame, and some early Distinguished Travellers like Doctor Sandells, Wasnesensky & others, Captains of Trading Vessels & SuperCargos, & even Californians (after the Indians was subdued) came and paid me a visit, and was astonished to see what for Work of all kinds has been done. Small Emigrant parties arrived, and brought me some very valuable Men, with one of those was Major Bidwell (he was about 4 Years in my employ). Major Reading & Major Hensley with 11 other brave Men arrived alone, both of those Gentlemen has been 2 Years in my employ, with these parties excellent Mechanics arrived which was all employed by me, likewise good farmers. We made imediately Amer. ploughs in my Shops and all kind of work done. Every year the Russians was bound to furnish me with good iron & Steel & files, Articles which could not be got here, likewise Indian Beeds and the most important of all was 100 lb of fine Rifle & 100 lb of Canon powder, and several 100 lb of Lead (every year). With these I was carefull like with Gold.
The Bartleson party which included John Bidwell arrived in November, 1841 Reading and Hensley came in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1843">1843</a>.

From the Hudsons Bay Company I received likewise great supplies, and particularly Powder, lead, and Shot, Beaver Trapps and Clothing (on Credit, to be paid for in Beaver and Otter Skins). They would not have done this to everyone; but as I has been highly recommended to these gentlemen from England and personally acquainted, they have done so. Once I received a visit of Mr. Douglas, who was the Commander in Chief of the establishments on the Pacific & the mountains, after Dr. McLaughlin resigned. With such a supply of Powder, Amunition & Arms, I made bold appearance. The fort was built in about 4 years of time, as it was very difficult to get the necessary lumber we was sawing by hand Oak timber. Under Gen'l Micheltorena our Govr. I received the rank and Title Capt. of the Mexican Army. He found it his Policy to be friend with me, as he was all time threatened with a Revolution of the Californians notwithstanding having about 1000 troupes (Mexicans). Having the rank as Capt. and Military Comander of the Northern frontieres, I began to drill the Indians, with the assistance of two good Non Commissioned Officers from my Country, which I promoted to Capt & first Lieut't & got their Comissions and from the time I had a self-made Garrison, but the Soldiers to earn for their Uniforms & food etc. had to work when they was not on Duty. During this time my Stock was increasing; had about then 8000 head of Cattle and 2000 horses and breeding Mares and about 4000 Sheep. Of the Wool we made our own Plankets, as we established under great Difficulties a factory. Plankets, like nearly all other articles was very scarce and sold to very high prices at the time.

Emigration continued in small parties, just strong enough to protect themselves travelling through a Country of hostile Indians, all of them was allways hospitably received under my roof and all those who could or would not be employed, could stay with me so long as they liked, and when leaving, I gave them Passports which was everywhere respected. Was some trouble below, all came immediately to me for protection. Of the different unfortunate Emigrations which suffered so much in the Snow, it is unnecessary to speak of, as it was published in the papers throughout the States.
</p><p>
In the fall <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1844">1844</a>, I went to Monterey with Major Bidwell and a few armed men (Cavallada & Servants); how it was customary to travell at these times, to pay a Visit to Gen'l Micheltorrena. I has been received with the greatest Civil and Military honors. One day he gave a great Diner, after Diner all the Troupes were parading, and in the evening a balloon was sent to the higher regions, etc, etc.
</p><p>
At the time it looked very gloomy; the people of the Country was arming and preparing to make a Revolution, and I got some sure and certain information, of the British Consul and other Gentlemen of my acquaintance which I visited on my way to Monterey. They did not know that the General and myself were friends, and told and discovered me the whole plan, that in a short time the people of the Country will be ready to blockade the General and his troupes in Monterey, and then take him prisoner and send him and his Soldiers back to Mexico, and make a Gov'r of their own people etc. I was well aware what we could expect should they succeed to do this; they would drive us foreigners all very soon out of the Country, how they have done it once, in the winter <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1839">1839</a>. Capt. Vioget has already been engaged by Castro & Alvarado to be ready with his vessel to take the Gen'l and his Soldiers to Mexico.
</p><p>
I had a confidential Conversation with Genl. Micheltorena who received me with great honors and Distinction in Monterey. After having him informed of all what is going on in the Country, he took his measures in a Counsel of war in which I has been present. I received my Orders to raise such a large auxiliary force as I possibly could, and to be ready at his Order, at the same time I received some Cartridges and some small Arms which I had shiped on board the Alert, and took a Passage myself for San Francisco (or then Yerba buena). If I had travelled by land, Castro would have taken me a Prisoner in San Juan, where he was laying in Ambush for me. In Yerba buena I remained only a few hours as my Schooner was ready to receive me on board, having waited for me at Ya. Ba. I visited the Officers of the Custom house and Castro's Officer, which immediately after I left received an Order to arrest me, but I was under fair Way to Sacramento.
Yerba Buena.
</p><p>
After my Arrival at the fort, I began to organize a force for the General, regular Drill of the Indian Infanterie took place, the Mounted Rifle Company about 100 Men of all Nations was raised, of which Capt. Gantt was the Commander; as all was under fair way and well organized, and joint with a Detachment of California Cavallry (which deserted from Vallejo) we left the fort with Music and flying Colors on the 1th January <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1845">1845</a>, to join the General, and comply with his Orders. Major Reading was left with a small Garrison of Frenchmen, Canadians and Indians, as Commander of the upper Country.

Castro had his Headquarters then in the Mission of San Jose. He did not expect us so soon, as he was just commencing to fortify himself, he ran away with his Garrison, was collecting a stronger force, and want to trouble us on our March, but as he saw that I was on a good Qui Vive for him, he left for Monterey to unite with the forces that was blockading the General and his troops in Monterey, and advanced or runed for the lower Country, to call or force the people there to take Arms against the Government. On the Salinas River near Monterey the Genl. was encamped, and with our united force, about 600 Men (he left a Garrison in Monterey) we pursued the enemy, and had to pursue him down to Los Angeles. The first encounter we had with the enemy was at Buenaventura, where we attacked him and drove them out their comfortable quarters. While at and near Santa Barbara, a great Many of Soldiers of my Division Deserted, over 50 men of the Mounted Rifles, the Detachment of Cala. Cavalry deserted and joined their Countrymen the Rebells, likewise a good number of the Mexican Dragoons.
</p><p>
Near San Fernando (Mission) the enemy occupied a fine position, and appeared in full strength, joined by a company of American Traders coming from Sonora and another Company of the same consisting of Traders and Trappers and the whole force of the enemy was over thousand Men, well provided with everything, and our force has been no more as about 350 or 375 Men, and during the battle of Cahuenga near San Fernando, the balance of the Mounted Riflemen, and the Artillerie deserted, and myself fell in the hands of the enemy and was taken prisoner and transported to Los Angeles.
</p><p>
A few days after this, the General, surrounded by the enemy, so that he could get nothing more to eat, capitulated, and after the necessary Documents was signed by both parties, the Genl. was allowed to march with Music and flying colours to San Pedro, where some vessels was ready to take him and his troops on board, and after having delivered their arms etc. proceeded up to Monterey to take the remaining Garrison, the family of the General and his privat property, likewise the families of some of the officers. This was the End of the reign of Genl. Govr. Manl. Micheltorena.
</p><p>
The new Govt. under Gov. Pio Pico, and General Castro, etc. had the intention to shoot me. They was of the Oppinion, that I had joined Genl. Micheltorena Voluntarely, but so soon as I could get my Baggage and my papers, I could prove and show by the Orders of my General that I have obeied his Orders, and done my Duty to the legal Government. And so I was acquitted with all honors, and confirmed in my former Offices as Military Commander of the Northern frontier, and encharged with the Justice, with the expressed wish that I might be so faithful to the new Govt. as I had been to Genl. Micheltorena.
</p><p>
While I was in Santa Barbara had a Conversation with Genl. Micheltorena, in reference of the expense, etc., because at the time I had already an Account of about $8000, without counting a cent for my own services, and for my whole rendered services from beginning of my different Offices which I held under Alvarado & the Genl. never they have paid me, even for a Courier, and never furnished me with a Govts. horse. The General told me that he knew this very well, and as he had no money, he would let me have some land, and even if I should like the sobrante for which I applied when last in Monterey, and which Document was mislaid or destroyed by Dn. Manuel Timeno. I told him that I would be contented, and as we are in Campaign and might be killed by the enemy I wish that the Document would be writen in the name of my eldest Son and my whole family.
sobrante: an extension of area to land previously granted.
</p><p>
The Genl. did send for one of his Aid-de-Camp Capt. Castaneda, who was acting Secretary. This Gentleman wrote the Document (he is alife yet), he has given his testimony before the Land Commission about 2 years ago. This Document with a many others has been given to John S. Fowler in Care while he was acting as my Agent, and was afterwards destroyed by fire.
</p><p>
After a return of hardship from San Fernando through Tulare Valley, we turned all out again to our former Occupations, and arrived at the fort on the 1th April <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1845">1845</a>.
