Dear Brother: I came up from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> right 
through the country that I had been the means of raiding so thoroughly, and did not know but I should hear 
some things that would not be pleasant, but, on the contrary, many people met me all along the road in the most 
friendly spirit. I spent a whole day at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=jackson" rel="city">Jackson</a>, where 
chimney stacks and broken railroads marked the presence 
of Sherman's army. But all sorts of people pressed to 
see me, and evinced their natural curiosity, nothing 
more. . . . 
</p><p>
I expect to have two Indian wars on my hands, and 
have no time for other things. The Sioux and Cheyennes are now so circumscribed that I suppose they 
must be exterminated, for they cannot and will not settle 
down, and our people will force us to it. It will also 
call for all possible prudence to keep us from war with 
the Mormons, for there are people that yearn for the 
farms and property the Mormons have created in the 
wilderness. 
</p><p>
I have a despatch from Mr. Stanton, saying that my 
action in the delicate mission to Mexico meets the approval of the President, the Cabinet, and himself, so I 
got out of that scrape easily. I do not want to come to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, but to stay here quietly as long as possible. 
When Grant goes to Europe, then I shall be forced to 
come. The longer that is deferred the better for me. 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
