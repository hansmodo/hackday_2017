Russell abuses us in his letters. People here care a great deal for what Russell says, because he represents the London Times, and the Times reflects the sentiment of the English people. How we do cling to 
the idea of an alliance with England or France ! Without France even Washington could not have done it.

We drove to the camp to see the President present a flag to a Maryland regiment. Having lived on the battle 
field (Kirkwood), near Camden, we have an immense respect for the Maryland line. When our militia in that 
fight ran away, Colonel Howard and the Marylanders held their own against Rawdon, Cornwallis, and the rest, and 
everywhere around are places named for a doughty captain killed in our defense Kirkwood, De Kalb, etc. The 
last, however, was a Prussian count. A letter from my husband, written June 22d, has just reached me. He says: 
</p><p>
" We are very strongly posted, entrenched, and have 
now at our command about 15,000 of the best troops in the 
world. We have besides, two batteries of artillery, a regiment of cavalry, and daily expect a battalion of flying 
artillery from Richmond. We have sent forward seven regiments of infantry and rifles toward Alexandria. Our out 
posts have felt the enemy several times, and in every instance the enemy recoils. <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>General Johnston</a> has had several encounters the advancing columns of the two armies and with him, too, the enemy, although always superior 
in numbers, are invariably driven back. 
</p><p>
" There is great deficiency in the matter of ammunition. <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>General Johnston's</a> command, in the very face of 
overwhelming numbers, have only thirty rounds each. If they had been well provided in this respect, they could and 
would have defeated Cadwallader and Paterson with great ease. I find the opinion prevails throughout the army that there is great imbecility and shameful neglect in the War Department. 
</p><p>
Unless the Republicans fall back, we must soon come together on both lines, and have a decided engagement. 
But the opinion prevails here that <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> army will not meet us if they can avoid it. They have already fallen 
back before a slight check from 400 of <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston's</a> men. They had 700 and were badly beaten. You have no idea 
how dirty and irksome the camp life is. You would hardly know your best friend in camp guise. 
</p><p>
Noise of drums, tramp of marching regiments all day long; rattling of artillery wagons, bands of music, friends 
from every quarter coming in. We ought to be miserable and anxious, and yet these are pleasant days. Perhaps we 
are unnaturally exhilarated and excited. 
</p><p>
Heard some people in the drawing-room say: <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> ladies are not young, are not pretty, and I am one 
of them. The truthfulness of the remark did not tend to alleviate its bitterness. We must put Maggie Howell and 
Mary Hammy in the foreground, as youth and beauty are in request. At least they are young things bright spots 
in a somber-tinted picture. The President does not forbid 
our going, but he is very much averse to it. We are consequently frightened by our own audacity, but we are wilful women, and so we go.
