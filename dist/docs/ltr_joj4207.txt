Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 20th inst. I received a copy of your report to the General Assembly of Louisiana, under a cover directed to 
me. To whom I am indebted for it, (\<>r< not appear ; the 
impression of the seal, which is that of your family, leads 
me to conjecture that you have had the goodness to send 
it. There are various important remarks and reflections 
in it which I believe to be just ; and there are others whose 
weight I cannot venture to estimate, without more thought 
and investigation than the state of my health admits of. I will, however, take the liberty of suggesting a few hints on two of the topics. 
</p><p>
That the government of a State should have authority to appoint " particular days for rendering thanks to God" for 
any signal blessing, or imploring his assistance " in any public calamity," is certainly proper. But, can any of our governments be rightfully restrained from providing for the 
observance of the Sabbath, which the Sovereign of the universe has instituted, and which our Saviour has assured us 
" was made for man ?" 
</p><p>
Again â€” Can any government be justifiable in exempting murderers from the punishment of death, in opposition to the positive declaration of the Almighty to Noah, and 
through him to all his posterity, that " whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed ;" not, I presume, at the discretion of private individuals, but under 
the cognizance and by the authority of government ? 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for this mark of friendly attention. 
</p><p>
I am, sir. 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
