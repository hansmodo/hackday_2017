I have on two pairs of heavy pants, three pairs stockings, two shirtsand yet scarcely feel comfortable. I put a large patch on my pantaloons, and I flatter myself that it was very well done. As the sun shone with pleasing brightness, the sunny side of
the vessel was crowded with passengers endeavoring to warm themselves, but Old Sol's rays are hardly proof against the cutting wind of this latitude. This morning the wind changed to a more favorable quarter, and we are now speeding on our course at a rapid rate, but many are beginning to be dissatisfied that the sails are nearly all hauled in at night, which has been the case for some time during the fairest wind and weather.

We have had delightful moonlight evenings but the air was most too sharp to enjoy them properly. While the weather was pleasant and the sea smooth, we repaired to the deck in the evening and mingled in the mazy dance, or listened to the charming notes of the violin. Now that the weather has become cold, we have opened a theatre in the second cabin and "Macbeth" was played with great effect amid thunders of applause from a crowded house, many of the first cabin passengers being present. Mr. McCowan constituted the orchestra. We have also had a series of Shakespearean readings by Mr. Rogers, accompanied by the discordant sounds of two horns, clapping of hands, stamping and shouting.

It is a singular fact that some of the passengers have become so infatuated in the passion for cards that they play from sunrise till bedtime. A stove was raised in the front cabin, and the table has been occupied by card players. This evening a merry trio, a lady (?) among them, played euchre. It is not my province to moralize, but here is a text that might be enlarged upon, though I suppose they have adopted the maxim of some of our New England fathers, "that Sabbath ends at sundown."

Last evening two of the passengers, a lady and a gentleman, took a "leveling party" and were so drunk they could hardly stand and were carrying on at a
terrible rate, railing at nearly all the passengers on boardtruly a rich occurrence. At the still hour of twelve, about a dozen piratical-looking Californians could be seen cooking a pan of molasses and butter over a small coal stove in the front cabin, speaking in low whispers lest they should be heard, for it was forbidden ground they were treading upon. After the mixture had been properly cooked, one of the craft took the dish out under the pretense of cooling itwhich was the last known of him until the luxury had been well stowed in hungry stomachs. But the cheated party were determined not to be put off in this manner and with a perseverance worthy of a good cause they proceeded to cook another dish and were more careful as to whom they trusted to cool it.

Our largest porker was slaughtered Thursday. It was in pretty good order, and we were promised a dinner on fresh meat, quite a delicacy. When the hour arrived a tremendous rush was made for the table but we were disappointed in our anticipations, as the pig killed was for the especial benefit of first cabin. However, two porkers were killed yesterday and one of them, about as big as a full-grown cat, was promised for our cabin today. We had a good pork sea pie. The second cabin passengers all arose from the table with gratified appetites and smiling faces, which with us is a very rare occurrence. Deep, low mutterings usually ensue after meals, and not without cause, as this is an almost intolerable place as far as table luxuries are concerned. Our bread now contains worms half an inch in length, and is a little mustya hard story, but nevertheless trueand our duff is very badly cooked, not better than mere dough heated. Complaint was made to the Captain and he gave us directions to flog the cook
next time it came to us in such a manner. I shall go to bed supperless. I have been much below par and in bed the greater part of the day.

The moon shines brightly and the sky is studded with here and there a bright star. All seems peace and glory, unlike the turbulent waters of the ocean and the yet more turbulent spirits upon the Europe. The Association sang a hymn and several chapters were read from the Bible by Mr. Rogers. And thus the Sabbath was ended.
