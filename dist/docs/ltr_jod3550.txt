MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
HERE I am out of all patience. Not a word from 
America. The British ministry lingering on. Mr. Hartley uncertain what to do. No regulation of 
commerce agreed on. No definitive treaty of peace 
signed, nor likely to be signed very soon. My spring 
passage home lost. To embark in July or August 
would be the worst season of the whole year, on ac 
count of heats and calms. I don t see a possibility 
of embarking before September or October. The 
total idleness, the perpetual uncertainty we are in, 
is the most insipid and at the same time disgusting 
and provoking situation imaginable. I had rather be 
employed in carting street dust and marsh mud. 
Neither do I know how or where I shall get a pas 
sage. I could now go with Mr. Van Berckel in a fine 
new sixty-eight gun ship. In the fall, I suppose I 
shall be obliged to step on board a merchant ship 
loaded down to the brim ; but whether from Holland, 
or from some port in France, I know not. So many 
vessels will run away to England that I fear it will 
be difficult to find a passage from France or Holland. 
But we must bear it all if we can. 
</p><p>
Our son is at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, pursuing his studies with 
great ardor. They give him a good character wherever he has been, and I hope he will make a good 
man. It is unaccountable that not one vessel should 
have arrived from any part of New England since 
the peace, nor for so long a time before. But all is 
mystery. Pray write me. Don t omit to write, until I arrive home. Direct to the care of Mr. Dumas, 
a r/iotel des Etats Unis d Amerique, at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, 
or to the care of <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, at Paris. These gentle 
men will take care of your letters, if I should be 
gone. 
</p><p>
Yours, with great affection, 
</p><p>
