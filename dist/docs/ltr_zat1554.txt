My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
We reached here on the 19th & after receiving a few cannon shot 
from the enemies Forts & batteries the same day, fell back & encamped 
at the first convenient position out of the range of their shot. On the 
2O th having reconnoitered the enemies position & defences, & finding 
alth greatly superior to us in numbers that he would not leave the tnow 
which was naturally very strong & completely fortified, supplied with a 
large amount of artillery, I at once made dispositions for carrying their 
out works which were very extensive, & detached Gen Worth with a 
strong force to the west end of the town to take possession of the Saltillo Road, & if practicable carry two or three sail 1 works commanding 
said road, & the approaches to the upper part of the city, all of which 
were situated on high portions of the mountains 
</p><p>
On the morning of the 21st Gen Worth informed me he was in 
position & wished a diversion could be made to aid him in his opera 
tions, the balance of the troops was soon in readiness for that or any 
other operation, & after being formed a portion of them consisting of the 
first, third & fourth Infr were ordered to threaten the east end of the 
town, & if it could be done to carry one of their out or advanced works ; 
they passed rapidly a very strong Fort driving the enemy from an 
unfinished one, & entered the twown with the fugitives, which enabled 
the volunteers to take possession of the strong Fort referred to ; on get 
ting into the town Cap 1 Mansfield of the engineers who led the advance, 
thought in the first instance it could be held if reinforcements were sent, 
which was immediately done, but it was soon found from the strong 
manner the streets were barracaded the Houses which were themselves 
each a fortification all built of stone with very thick walls with loop 
holes for small arms, as well as other defenses, & the streets raked by 
artillery in every direction it was impossible to accomplish any thing in 
comparison to the loss which we were sustaining I therefore drew off the 
troops in good order, holding on to the strong fort which had been taken 
with four pieces of artillery In this affair our losses were very great 
among both regulars & volunteers, an acc t of which was communicated 
to you by Majr Bliss The attack or investment was continued on 
the 22 d on the eve of which day an important work was taken possess 
of by Gen Worths command on the west end of the town ; the same 
night several strong works on the east end of the city were abandoned by 
the enemy within musket shot of the works we had previously taken, & 
were at once occupied by the volunteers on duty near them, which 
opened the city to us, & which was entered at both ends during that day, 
& the enemy driven from house to house into the principal open square 
near the Cathedral, where they had collected the greater portion of their 
forces with the intention of making their last stand ; at night the troops 
were recalled in good order on the east end of the city to the Forts 
which commanded the entrance into it, while those in the opposite end 
occupied the ground they had taken During this day the 23 d the 
Gov r of the province addressed me a communication requesting that the 
women & children might be withdrawn from the city, which request I 
declined granting ; that night I directed all operations to be suspended 
untill I could make the proper arrangements for a united attack ; early 
on the morning of the 24th  while those arrangements were going on, I 
rec d by the hands of a staff officer with a flag a communication from 
Gen Ampudia the commander of the Mexican force proposals for surrendering the city provided he was permitted to leave it with his army, 
arms & baggage of every description ; this I declined when he requested 
a personal interview which ended after a protracted conversation in fixing 
on three individuals to settle the terms of the capitulation which were 
that the Infantry, cavalry & artillery should be permitted to retire to the 
interior of Mexico the officers to march out with their side arms & private property, the Infr & cavelry with their muskets, side arms &c & 
the artillery with six field guns ; the balance of the public property to be 
turned over to the U. States These terms were liberal but not con 
sidered too much so by all reflecting men belonging to the army here 
especially considering our situation ; besides it was thought it would be 
judicious to act with magniminity towards a prostrate foe, particularly as 
the president of the U. States had offered to settle all differences between 
the two countries by negotiation, & the Mexican commander stating that 
said propositions he had no doubt would be favorably met by his go t as 
their was a Gen wish for peace on the part of the nation We took 
ten, & there was turned over to us, twenty two or three pieces of brass 
cannon, & an immense quantity of amunition enough if suited to our 
guns to carry on the war for 1 2 months Their regular force was rated 
at 7200, irregulars at 2000 besides the citizens of the town who must 
have amounted to several thousand who were capable & no doubt bore 
arms. How we were permitted to take & occupy so large a place, one 
of the strongest naturally in the country, strongly fortified with 41 or 2 
pieces of artillery, abundantly supplied with ammunition is wonderful to 
say, even at the loss we sustained which is near 500 killed & wounded 
</p><p>
I trust this will have some effect to bring about a peace, if not we 
will have to carry the war father into their country, as soon as we can 
get the means of doing so Col Taylor has not yet joined but I learn 
he is now on his way from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> to this place with funds for his dep c 
escorted by a detachment from the 2 d Infy so that a portion of that Rg 
must have reached the Rio Grande

My love to Ann & the children when you write, who I trust you 
have recently heard from & were all well at last dates & will long continue so My regards to all inquiring friends at the Point & accept 
my sincere wishes for the continued health & prosperity of you & yours 
through life.

An armistice has been entered into for 8 weeks, or until our respective eovts could be heard from ; this was or is a mater of no moment as it 
regards us, as we would be hardly again ready to take the field short of 
six weeks, unless the enemy should compel us to do so, which they can 
do in 20 days without violating the terms of the capitulation, as they can 
hear from Mexico short of that time ; the authorities there having the 
power to disclaim what has been done ; so that I must make every 
arrangement in my power to meet every contingency
