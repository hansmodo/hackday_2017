Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your interesting letter of the 19th 
March, which was immediately communicated to Congress. 
I consider it as a new proof of that constant and useful 
attention to our affairs, from which the United States have 
so often derived both pleasure and advantage. Let me 
request the continuance of your correspondence, and be 
assured that it will always give me pleasure to communicate to you such intelligence respecting American occurrences as may appear interesting.

Don Diego Gardoqui is arrived, and has been received 
so much in the spirit of friendship, that 1 hope his master 
and himself will be well pleased. Our negotiations with 
him will soon commence, and I sincerely wish that the 
issue of them may be satisfactory to both countries. To 
prepare for war, and yet be tenacious of peace with all the 
wwld, is, I think, our true interest. I wish Mr. Gardoqui's 
instructions may be sufficiently extensive to admit of a settlement of our boundaries, &c, on principles which alone 
can create and perpetuate cordiality.

The British show no disposition to evacuate our frontier 
posts. What their real designs are, can at present be only 
inferred and conjectured from appearances ; and present 
appearances induce a suspicion that they mean to hold 
them. The letters we expect from <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a> will probably remove all doubts on that head. It is certain that 
they pay great attention to the Indians, and give great encouragement to emigrants from us. Their expectations 
from the latter circumstance will fail them. I wish that 
every acre of ground they hold in America was settled by 
natives of the United States. They would transplant their 
love of liberty, their spirit of enterprise, and their attachment to republicanism into countries in which it is our 
interest that such plants should be propagated and flourish ; 
in time they will bear fruit. 
</p><p>
The commercial class of our people sensibly feel the 
restraints on our trade, and look up to Congress for a 
remedy. Good will come out of evil ; these discontents 
nourish federal ideas. As trade diminishes, agriculture 
must suffer ; and hence it will happen that our yeomen will 
be as desirous of increasing the powers of Congress, as our 
merchants now are. All foreign restrictions, exclusions, and 
unneighbourly ordinances will tend to press us together, 
and strengthen our bands of union. 
</p><p>
I send you herewith a number of gazettes, from which 
you will discern something of the spirit which prevails. 
</p><p>
Congress go on doing business with great concord, 
temper, and harmony. I enclose a copy of the ordinance 
for regulating the Land Office. They are now on the subject of requisitions ; and I flatter myself, that as the highest 
respect for good faith prevails in the House, that exertions 
will be made by the States to preserve the public credit.

Governor Livingston was appointed for the Hague, but 
declining that place, <a href='/results.php?tla=ewr' rel='colleague met friend'>Gov. Rutledge</a> has been elected for it. 
His answer has not yet reached.

When, my dear sir, will your court send us a minister ? 
Our having one at Versailles, affords reason to expect one 
from thence. The report of Mons. De Montiers coming 
over in that capacity dies away. From the little I saw of 
him in Paris, I am inclined to think he would be an agreeable, as well as an able minister. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
