I hardly know how these last days have passed. I have an indistinct recollection of rides in cane-wagons to the most distant field, coming back 
perched on the top of the cane singing, "Dye my petticoats," to the great amusement of the General who followed on horseback. Anna and Miriam, 
comfortably reposing in corners, were too busy to 
join in, as their whole time and attention were entirely devoted to the consumption of cane. It was 
only by singing rough impromptus on Mr. Harold and Captain Bradford that I roused them from their 
task long enough to join in a chorus of "Forty Thousand Chinese." I would not have changed my 
perch, four mules, and black driver, for Queen Victoria's coach and six.

And to think <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>old Abe</a> wants to deprive us of all 
that fun ! No more cotton, sugar-cane, or rice ! No more old black aunties or uncles ! No more rides 
in mule teams, no more songs in the cane-field, no more steaming kettles, no more black faces and 
shining teeth around the furnace fires! If <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> 
could spend the grinding season on a plantation, he would recall his proclamation. As it is, he has only 
proved himself a fool, without injuring us. Why, last evening I took old Wilson's place at the bagasse 
shoot, and kept the rollers free from cane until I had thrown down enough to fill several carts, and had 
my hands as black as his. What cruelty to slaves! And black Frank thinks me cruel, too, when he meets 
me with a patronizing grin, and shows me the nicest vats of candy, and peels cane for me. Oh! very 
cruel! And so does Jules, when he wipes the handle of his paddle on his apron, to give "Mamselle" 
a chance to skim the kettles and learn how to work ! Yes! and so do all the rest who meet us with a 
courtesy and "Howd'y, young Missus!" Last night we girls sat on the wood just in front of the furnace 
- rather Miriam and Anna did, while I sat in their laps and with some twenty of all ages crowded 
around, we sang away to their great amusement. Poor oppressed devils! Why did you not chunk us 
with the burning logs instead of looking happy, and laughing like fools? Really, some good old Abolitionist is needed here, to tell them how miserable 
they are. can't <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Mass Abe</a> spare a few to enlighten his brethren?
