My dear General, 
</p><p>
IN the full confidence you receive my letters as 
testimonials of my unceasing respect, and from a solicitude to acquaint you -with all material contingencies in the administration of our national affairs, that 
you may he able to form your judgment on authentic documents, and, consequently, that your opinions, 
being bottomed on truth, may not fail to produce the 
most beneficial effects to our country, I again address 
you, and mean to confine myself to one subject, which 
will, I apprehend, soon become the topic of public 
debate. Among the defects which degrade the Constitution of the Federal Government, is the physical 
impossibility of secrecy in the sovereignty. Therefore, 
it is often necessary to make confidential communications, when they serve to correct the circulation of 
erroneous informations on subjects of national concern, which, in their nature, are secret, but, from the 
cause just mentioned, become public. Considering 
myself, therefore, at full liberty to give you a history of this business, I will do it with brevity. 
</p><p>
We are told here that the decided difference which 
prevailed in Congress on the proposed treaty with 
Spain, is generally understood in every part of the 
Union ; and it is suggested, that the project of the 
treaty will become the subject of deliberation in the 
Assembly of Virginia. 
</p><p>
True it is, that this affair unfortunately produced 
an intemperance common in democratic bodies, and 
always injurious to the interest of the public; for, to 
judge wisely on systems and measures, the mind ought to be free from prejudice and warmth^ and influenced 
by a full, deliberate view of the general effects of such system and measures. 
</p><p>
The Eastern States consider a commercial connection with Spain as the only remedy for the distresses 
which oppress their citizens ; most of which, they say, 
flow from the decay of their commerce. Their Delegates have, consequently, zealously pressed the formation of this connection, as the only effectual mode to 
revive the trade of their country. In this opinion, 
they have been joined by two of the Middle States. 
On the other hand, Virginia has, with equal zeal, opposed the connection, because the project involves, expressly, the disuse of the navigation of the Mississippi 
for a given time, and eventually, they think, will 
sacrifice our right to it. The Delegation is under injunctions from the State on this subject. They have 
acted in obedience to their instructions, and, myself 
excepted, in conformity to their private sentiments. 
I confess that I am by no means convinced of the 
justness or policy of our instructions, and very much 
apprehend, unless they are repealed by the present 
Assembly, the fatal effects of discord in counsel wall 
be experienced by the United States in a very high 
degree. 
</p><p>
The project submitted by the Secretary for Foreign 
Affairs w\as founded, as well as I can recollect, on 
the following principles. First; the commerce between 
the United States and the King of Spain, to be 
founded on the principles of perfect reciprocity, which 
reciprocity to be diffused in all the sub-regulations. 
Secondly; the trade to be confined to his Catholic 
Majesty's European dominions. Thirdly ; the bond fide 
manufactures and produce of the respective countries, 
imported into either, to be subject to the same duties 
as are paid by the citizens and subjects of the two 
nations. Fourthly ; a tariff to be established by Convention, within one year after the ratification of the 
treaty, ascertaining the necessary duties to be imposed. Fifthly; masts and timber, annually requisite 
for the navy of Spain, to be bought from the merchants 
of the United States in preference, provided they are 
equal in price and quality. 
</p><p>
There are some other matters, which I forget. In 
consideration of the advantages of this treaty, the 
United States stipulate to forbear, for the term of the 
treaty, the use of the River Mississippi. The boundaries will be (in case of treaty) established, as fixed 
in the definitive treaty of peace between the United 
States and Great Britain. The article of tobacco is 
excepted in the project, being the produce of Spanish 
colonies, and is to continue on the present footing, 
which is favorable. 
</p><p>
Thus have I delineated to you the outlines of the 
proposed plan. Among the many arguments used by 
the advocates for the treaty, I will mention only one, 
which I think ought to be know^n. They say that 
the right of the navigation of the Mississippi is disputed; that the use of that right is now suspended, 
and cannot be possessed but by force or by treaty, 
and that a forbearance of the use, on our part, is a 
confirmation of our right ; the use of which right will 
be in due time possessed, in consequence of the present project, without putting our claim to the issue 
of war, which is always precarious, and for which we 
are totally unprepared. 
</p><p>
Should this matter come before our Assembly, much 
will depend on <a href='/results.php?tla=gem' rel='colleague'>Mr. Mason</a>'s sentiments. So many 
reasons, founded on true policy, will arise in a full 
investigation of this subject, that I cannot but hope that the State of Virginia will consider a treaty with 
Spain, on the principles of the project, essentially 
necessary to her political happiness, and to her commercial aggrandizement. 
</p><p>
The sedition in Massachusetts is, in some degree, 
subsided, but is not, I fear, extinguished.

Colonel Monroe, who was an Aid in Lord Stirling's 
family, a Delegate from Virginia in Congress, will, in 
a few days, return home with his lady. He means 
to do himself the honor to pay his respects to Mount 
Vernon in his way. My best respects to Mrs. Washington, with, &c., &c.,
