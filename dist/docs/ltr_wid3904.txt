That terrible performance which, by-the-by, most wise and respected rulers, was torn down, as it were, from under your noses, almost as 
soon as it was stuck up in <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, reached this place only last night; 
and with all imaginable tenderness, I beg leave to assure you, that it is only to your own handy work you are indebted for this public reprehension. 
</p><p>
In plain terms I tell you, your proclamation is a compound of non 
sense and falsehoods. It is illegal and void in itself, for your law does 
not consider that an offence which you proclaim to be so. The King 
of Great Britain's late proclamation, even although by the advice of 
the House of Commons, to apprehend Wheble, the printer, is a case in 
point. The party was apprehended; but a magistrate of London, 
knowing that an apprehension under such a proclamation was illegal, 
discharged him. But, to satisfy you how I regard your proclamation, 
and the people of Georgia what an empty thing it is, I do hereby 
promise to furnish the necessary sums of money to institute and prose 
cute an action of damages for false imprisonment, against the party 
who shall apprehend any one in consequence of it ; and I hint to you, that the famous cases of the journeymen printers against the king's messengers, are in terrorem.

The Confederation you speak of is an imposition upon the people of 
Georgia no other of the States of America but yours having ratified 
or even considered of any such thing, or have had it to consider of. 
Pray, how did you blunder upon it? The Congress never sent it to 
you. Why, they have not even concluded upon such a thing them 
selves, nor does the resolution you mention warrant your assertion relative to "letters, petitions, animosities, imaginary grievances/ about 
" all which/ to use your own words, it is absolutely silent. Why, 
you really bring yourselves into utter contempt, proclaiming, as you do 
to the people, things that are not. Let me whisper in your ears, that 
this proclamation of yours is not the first instance of your doing so. 
</p><p>
You say I was " daily exciting animosities amongst the inhabitants, 
under the pretence of redressing imaginary grievances/ but you can 
not prove that I, even for an hour, endeavored to excite animosities. I 
was not among your inhabitants eight and forty hours. Twelve of 
these I spent in bed, the others at private entertainments by invitation, 
or while I travelled an unavoidable route; during the whole time of 
which, even the subject of an union, or your nial-administration, was 
scarcely mentioned. To some gentlemen of Georgia, who applied to me 
in my own State, I spoke in plain terms of the real grievances under 
which they labored. Upon their desire, I threw the matter into the 
form of a petition for a redress of them; and do you dare to threaten 
petitioners, or the promoters of petitions, for redress of grievances, 
with imprisonment? You would deserve to be hanged for doing so, 
but that you know not what you do.

In the year <a href='/results.php?year=1679'>1679</a>, Charles II. issued a proclamation against petitions 
"for specious purposes relating to the public," "for that they tended 
to promote discontents among the people, and to raise sedition and 
rebellion." But, when the Parliament met, they voted that the subject 
had a right to petition, and " that to traduce petitioning as tumultuous, 
is betraying the liberty of the subject, and tends to the introducing of 
arbitrary power." Lord Chief Justice North drew the proclamation, 
and the Parliament ordered him to be impeached for it. He escaped 
condign punishment only because of his great caution in the draft of 
the proclamation, in which he only commanded all "magistrates, and 
other officers to whom it shall appertain, to take effectual care that all 
such offenders against the laws be prosecuted and punished according to 
their demerits." These magistrates and other officers saw no demerit 
in petitioning for redress of grievances; they, therefore, issued no process against persons promoting such petitions. But you (as traitors or 
simpletons only would do) traduce petitioning, and order petitioners to be 
apprehended a step that Lord Chief Justice North did not even dare 
to advise.

As things are situated in Georgia, and as that Government is con
ducted, I think I am bound to proclaim to your people and turn about, 
you know, is but fair play that in my opinion, which, I believe, will 
go farther with them than yours to the contrary, their property is not 
secure under your Government &gt;a disgrace and detriment to the 
American cause that the life and liberty of the subject are in the 
greatest danger under your management, or we should not, among many 
other enormities, have seen George McIntosh, Esq., who I consider as 
an abused gentleman, arbitrarily ordered into a distant State, to be tried 
by those who have no such jurisdiction in such a case, and far out of 
the reach of a jury of his vicinage; circumstances of tyranny, and 
total disregard to the most valuable rights of the people, that not only 
ought to alarm every honest and sensible man in Georgia, but fill such 
with indignation against you; that I highly approve the proposed union, 
and will promote it to the utmost of my power, notwithstanding (as you 
think) your formidable proclamations, That now, having the very 
great honor of addressing you, I snatch the opportunity to make even 
yourselves co-operate in advancing my plan of an union; and to make 
you instruments to convey to the inhabitants of Georgia my most 
friendly and pressing recommendations, that while their Assembly 
shall be sitting, they will redouble their efforts to procure a redress of 
their grievances, and an union with this State; and this my declaration, 
that I am inclined to think you are concealed Tories, or their tools, who 
have clambered up, or have been put into office, in order to burlesque 
Government and I never saw a more extravagant burlesque upon the 
subject than you exhibit that the people might be sick of an American 
administration, and strive to return under the British domination, 
merely for the sake of endeavoring to procure something like law and 
order. I respect the people of Georgia; but, most wise rulers, kissing 
your hands, I cannot but laugh at some folks. Can you guess who 
they are? 
</p><p>
And so, you would fain use me ill ? It is well for you that I am in 
a most excellent humor. See how handsomely I will treat you. A 
good book says, " Bless them that curse you." Let me assure you I 
obey the precept most devoutly. Could you have expected such a 
return ? 
</p><p>
I have now answered your proclamation, with what, as great folks 
should use great titles, I call a declaration. If you are content, I am 
satisfied, and we may possibly be good friends yet. However, if you 
have a mind to amuse the public with any other productions of your 
masterly pens, and wish to draw me in, to contribute to the entertainment, I have no objection to be of the party; but I warn you beforehand, that whatever I contribute shall be entirely at your expense. 
This is but equitable; so if you are for such a frolic, I am, with all 
due respect to your dignities, and compassion to your follies,
