Sir, 
</p><p>
Inclosed I return to you the papers which accompanied your favor of the 25th ultimo. It did not 
reach me until yesterday morning, when I submitted 
the whole to the Assembly. But the approach of 
the session to an end, forbids them to take up new 
business. The day after to-morrow is fixed for their 
departure, and much of what is now before them 
must be left incomplete. I am therefore desired, by 
the Speaker of the Delegates, to send the papers to 
you, and to assure you that the Assembly are fully 
sensible of your readiness to embrace every opportunity to improve the manufactures of our country. 
You know, Sir, that the Executive cannot give an 
establishment, or even aid, to M. de la Yallee, without the approbation of the Legislature. 
</p><p>
Although I was compelled, by duty, to lay before 
the Council your answer to my notification of your 
appointment to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I was happy to find 
them concurring with me in the propriety of entreating you not to decide on a refusal immediately. 
Perhaps the obstacles now in view may he removed 
before Mayj and the nomination of a successor, if 
necessary at all, will be as effectually made some 
time hence as now. Perhaps, too (and indeed I fear 
the event), every other consideration may seem of. 
little weight, wheu compared with the crisis which 
may then hang over the United States. I hope, 
therefore, that you will excuse me for holding up 
your letter for the present, and waiting until time 
shall disclose the result of the commotions now prevailing. I have the honor to be, Sir, 
</p><p>
With the most perfect esteem and respect, &c., 
</p><p>
