My Dear Brother : It was about the middle of November, and on one of those mornings so peculiar to your 
atmosphere, that I deposited my bones in the Chilicothe 
stage. I went to Portsmouth, thence down the Ohio to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, where I remained with Lamp a couple of 
days, and then took my departure for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> in the 
steamboat Manhattan, loaded with every species of animal from men to Durham cattle. There were more than 
200 souls on board a second-class boat, from which circumstance you can readily infer that the bodily comforts 
were not well cared for. Yet I was much pleased. 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, at which we stopped several hours, is a beautiful place ; in fact, the whole river realized my wildest 
conceptions. In six days we reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>, which, you 
know, is trying to rival our queen city ; but, although 
it has great merits and beauty beside a population of 
30,000 people, it has not that fixed and solid appearance 
that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> now wears as an established city of business and manufacture. I spent ten days in and near St. 
Louis, after which I embarked in a new and very fine 
boat, called the John Aull, for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>. . . . The 
trip cannot fail to interest one who has never been in 
the South, but, as I was familiar there, it could not produce its full effect. Imagine yourself, as I was, at the 
mouth of the Ohio in a heavy snowstorm, the shores 
clothed in ghost-like garb ; the following day the snow 
is no longer seen, and before another day passes by the 
shores are clothed here and there in green corn and 
grass. Soon' the oak appears with its green leaves, then 
the magnolia, orange, etc., and soon you find yourself 
down between the rich sugar-fields of Louisiana, the 
stalks ungathered and waving beautifully and luxuriantly in the breeze. ... At Mobile I took a steamboat 
and ascended the Alabama River to a town called Montgomery. There, on a vehicle called a car on what was 
denominated a railroad to a town called Franklin, from 
which place I staged it over roads such as you have 
about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a>, except the clay is slipperier, the hills 
shorter and steeper, and the drivers such as can be had 
nowhere else. Thus I went 120 miles to a town in 
Georgia called Griffin. Here I waited twenty-four hours 
for the cars, which had as usual run off the track. However, they came at last, and we started towards Macon, 
a distance of only sixty miles, which it took us twelve 
hours to accomplish. However, at Macon I found a 
well-finished railroad which led to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a>, a distance 
of 190 miles, over which we passed in exactly the same 
time that it took us the day before to accomplish the 
sixty. From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a> to Charleston I had the regular 
steamboat. Thus it has taken me the whole sheet to 
give you an outline of my journey, the details of which 
volumes would scarcely record. At last, on the 27th of 
December, after an absence of five months and two days, 
I stood once more in my old quarters at Ft. Moultrie. 
Since my return the weather has been so bright and delightful. that I have almost renounced all allegiance to 
Ohio, although it contains all whom I love and regard as 
friends. I have been so busy of late that I have not 
even been to Charleston to see my old acquaintances, 
and could only steal time the other day to accept an 
invitation of some planters on an adjacent island to participate in a fox hunt and the consequent dinner and 
frolic.
