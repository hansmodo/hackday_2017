HON'D SlR, The inclosed paper will give you a knowledge 
of the mode and terms on which Tobacco is made a Commutable. It also contains some Resolutions of importance relative 
to the navigation of the Mississippi. The Senate have concurred in them, though not unanimously. Some of the members 
of that branch objected to the pointedness of the language; 
others doubted the propriety of taking up a subject of so delicate a nature without official information from the delegation 
in Congress.

The repeal of the port bill was yesterday a subject of discussion, and rejected by 70 against 36, so that the law is likely to 
become permanent. Amendments, however, are necessary, and 
will probably take place. We have a bill depending for establishing District Courts, differing from the Assize in this respect, 
that the former will be vested with as compleat jurisdiction 
within the District as the General Court exercises over the 
whole State. Unhappily, it is clogged with a clause installing 
all debts among ourselves, so as to make them payable in three 
annual portions. Such an interposition of the law in private 
contracts is not to be vindicated on any Legislative principle 
within my knowledge, and seems obnoxious to the strongest objections which prevailed against paper money. How it will be 
relished I cannot say, the matter not having yet been taken 
into discussion. I think it probable that it will miscarry, and 
that it will involve the District bill in its fate. 
No thorough revision of the taxes has yet taken place. The 
inclosed report of a Committee will present some ideas which 
are to be discussed. In general, the bias of the House seems 
to be strongly towards taxes which are to operate indirectly, 
and on articles of luxury. The lawyers and County Court 
clerks are also likely to be squeezed. One-tenth of the fees 
of the former, and one-third of those of the latter, were voted 
to-day to be a proper share for the public. Riding Carriages 
were also voted to be proper objects of additional taxation. 
Coaches, &c., are to pay six dollars per wheel, Phaetons 4 dollars, and Chairs, &c., 2 dollars per wheel. Whether these extravagant ideas will be persisted in is uncertain. I can scarcely 
suppose they will, in their full extent.

The Convention in Kentucky was prevented by the Expeditions into the Indian Country. It is proposed that another 
Convention shall be authorized to decide the question of their 
Independence.
