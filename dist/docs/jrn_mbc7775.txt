<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='13'>13th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. My husband at last did come for a visit of two hours. Brought Lawrence, who had been to Camden, and was there, indeed, during the raid. My husband has been ordered to Chester, S. C. We are surprised 
to see by the papers that we behaved heroically in leaving everything we had to be destroyed, without one thought of 
surrender. We had not thought of ourselves from the heroic point of view. Isaac McLaughlin hid and saved every 
thing we trusted him with. A grateful negro is Isaac.
