<p> Dear <a href="results.php?tla=rte">Ruth</a> and all,
<p> We are all quite concerned about <a href="results.php?tla=ebe">Mom</a>, hope to hear soon that she is out of the hosp. And what it turned out to be. When Mom wrote she had just talked to you on the 15th of Jan, and she mentioned you still did not have the results of the x-rays, so of course couldn&#8217;t tell us exactly what was wrong. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s probably scared stiff and you will have quite a time with her if she&#8217;s back at your house. I remember way back when <a href="results.php?tla=dse">Dan</a> and I were first married and she had to go to O&#8217;Conner, it really threw her, poor thing, and now it&#8217;s probably worse. I don&#8217;t envy you a bit, but am so thankful you are there to cope with things. Does <a href="results.php?tla=jepe">Dad</a> know about her illness and how has he reacted?
<p> We all enjoyed <a href="results.php?tla=gae">Gail&#8217;s</a> letter of Jan. 9th, and yours of the 11th, except for the bad news in them. Gail&#8217;s burglary really is dreadful. I keep thinking we used to consider such matters routine for South America, but not for the good ole USA!
<p> Also I&#8217;m sorry to hear <a href="results.php?tla=kje">Kathy</a> dropped out- temporarily I hope! In case it will inspire her to graduate, remind her that after 2 quarters at Stanford I was (-18) a D average and placed on probation- if I had gone -21 it would have meant suspension and I settled down, and eventually graduated with adequate, if not brilliant grades! So there&#8217;s no reason to get discouraged and quit so early in the going.
<p> I hope you, <a href="results.php?tla=rte">Ruth</a>, managed to escape the Hong Kong altogether. What with helping to nurse all the rest of the family it would be almost a miracle if you escaped. 
<p> We&#8217;re pleased that Packard got confirmed, looked iffy for a few days there- I&#8217;m almost afraid to pick up the newspaper these days- there&#8217;s always a new crisis daily , somewhere. The latest news from the SU campus is bad again, after things simmered down for a while.
<p> I wrote you that everything arrived and was appreciated- our letters probably crossed. I haven&#8217;t had any letters from Mom since before Christmas, so don&#8217;t know if any got lost.
<p> The vacation was very pleasant- the Iguacu Falls are really gorgeous and a spectacular sight. At Guauija, some of the beaches were contaminated by a burst sewer, but we had the hotel swim pool and the boys got in some surfing at another beach. The kids go back to school on Wed. 29th, and I hope I get organized again-
<p> Love to all
