Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I never expected to be appointed Secretary of the 
Treasury, as you suggest he might, for if he thought of it 
I could not accept by reason of the political complication 
of the Ohio Legislature. I should be gratified with the 
offer and opportunity to decline, but I suppose in this 
matter he will not choose to deal in compliments. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
