SIR The acquaintance, I had the honour, to form with you when I was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, in the year '51, will, I hope excuse me to you, for the freedom of this letter. 
When I consider the weight you deservedly possess, in affairs relative to this colony, I know not any person 
to whom I can, with more propriety, apply for an application in my behalf, that I may be appointed to fill the next vacancy in his majesty's council. I am the more 
induced to an application, at this time, as I am informed, that an address is preparing by the council, to his majesty, to remove Mr. from their board, on account 
of his extreme incapacity, to discharge the important duties of that station. If that address succeed, as I should imagine it would, from the weighty reasons 
assigned in it, then sir, I would lay myself under the great obligation that will arise from your interposition in my behalf: an obligation which will ever influence me, to 
consider you as my great benefactor, and particular friend. The desire I have to do my country service, is my only motive for this solicitation; and governed by 
the same reason, my attention has been, for some time turned to public business, both as a member of the legislature, and of our inferior courts of Justice. This 
experience supported by a laudable ambition, will, I hope, render me an object not altogether unworthy of your patronage. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with great respect and esteem, your obedient servant,
