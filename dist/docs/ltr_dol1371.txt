A few hours only have passed since you left me, my beloved, and I find nothing 
can relieve the oppression of my mind but speaking to you, in this, the only way. 
Dr. Physic called before you had gone far, but I could only find voice to tell him my 
knee felt better. Betsey Pemberton and Amy (her maid) are sitting by me, and 
seem to respect the grief they know I feel at even so short a separation from one who 
is all to me. I shall be better when Peter returns with news, not that any length of 
time could lessen my first regret, but an assurance that you are well and easy will 
contribute to make me so. I have sent the books and note to Mrs. D. Betsey 
puts on your hat to divert me, but I can not look at her.

October 24. What a sad day! The watchman announced a cloudy morning 
at one o clock, and from that moment I found myself unable to sleep, from anxiety for thee, 
my dearest husband. Detention, cold, and accident seem to menace 
thee. Betsey, who lay beside me, administered several drops of laudanum, which 
had a partial effect. Every one is most kind and attentive.

October 25. This clear, cold morning will favor your journey, and enliven the 
feelings of my darling. I have nothing new to tell you. The knee is mending, 
and I sit just as you left me. The doctor, during his short visits, talks of you. He 
regards you more than any man he knows, and nothing could please him so much as 
a prospect of passing his life near you ; sentiments so congenial to my own, and in 
such cases, like dew-drops on flowers, exhilarate as they fall. The Governor, I 
hear, has arrived, and is elated with his 
good fortune. General Moreau is expected in town very shortly, to partake of a grand 
dinner the citizens are about to give him. Adieu, my beloved, our hearts understand each other.

In fond affection thine,
