Thimotheus leaves this afternoon for Chelsea, where he intends to stop a week and then produce a sensation in Bucksport, so this letter will be rather out of date when you get it but it will save you 10¢, which is more than it is worth.

We are enjoying most lovely weather. The public grounds, the Park and Battery are dressed out in their summer attire as well as the ladies that walk in them. My boarding house is but a few steps from Broadway, not much like quiet Clinton Street in Brooklyn. I believe there is no time night or day, but what carriages or people are passing, but I have gotten used to it and can sleep just as well. We have a very pleasant company at the house, including a lady who came yesterday and took dinner with white kids on, which I suppose must be the latest fashion. Although I have been there scarcely a fortnight I have become acquainted with most of them. We don't live in the same house here in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> for months and not know each other. We have several married folks and the rest young uns of both sexes. We live in fashionable style: breakfast at half past seven, dine at three. Supper is not much account, on the whole I am very well contented.

Last evening Tim and our friend Bob and myself attended the Broadway Theatre to see Anderson play in the 'Lady of Lyons' and he played the part better than ever

I saw it done before. By the way, when Henry Blodget was here he went to see Christy's Minstrels (tell it not in Gath). Harry is a sensible fellow, I think.

There was a great influx of white cravats last week. The most interesting part of the performance was the Abolition breakfast at the Colosseum, when the whites gave the black waiters and cooks a meal and waited on them, reversing the usual order of things. The Hutchinsons honored them with their presence. They could sing their abolition songs without being hissed. It must have been a most savory meal. How John Buck would have enjoyed it, he what!

I send you by Tim 'Oh Susannah,' which the Christys do sing great. You should hear them sing it once. I guess it will be new to you. If you think of any other, write me and I will send it along. They beat Dumboltons, whom you heard, all to pieces. I hope they will take a turn down East this summer so that you can hear them.
