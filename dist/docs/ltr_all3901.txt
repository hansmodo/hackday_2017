HEAD-QUARTERS, <a rel="month origin" value="5">May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='23'>23</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1782' rel="origin">1782</a>, 
SIR: 
</p><p>
Capt. Skelly having stated to me the queries he had the honor to 
receive from you, respecting the papers I submitted to your consideration, and what official authority I had for proposing a cessation of hostilities, and believing a treaty for terminating the war was now carrying 
on, I have, therefore, to inform you that those papers were transmitted 
to me by his Excellency, Sir Henry Clinton, accompanied by the Right 
Hon. Welbore Ellis, then one of his Majesty s principal secretaries of 
State, referring generally for my conduct in this respect ; and that, I 
suppose, not only from the weight of their authority, but likewise from 
the explicit terms in which they convey the sense of his Majesty and 
the British House of Commons. Fuller instructions I momently expect from our present Commander-in-Chief, Sir Guy Carlton, whose 
appointment and arrival in America has not yet been regularly notified 
to me. Thus, sir, I have explicitly stated to you the mode and circumstances under which these important papers have reached me; and as I 
can have no doubt from current report, and the nature of these documents, that a suspension of hostilities has taken place to the Northward, 
and that a treaty to conclude the war is now carrying on, I held it a 
duty I owed the rights of humanity, the welfare of this country, and 
the sentiments of the Legislature, of my own to propose, that such a 
cessation should take place here, and this proposal, from these motives, 
I again renew, and will depute, if it meets your concurrence, commissioners to settle the terms of it, and for securing the interests, as well 
civil as military of each party, in the present state, assuring you, at the 
same time, you will have the earliest notice of what instructions and 
advice I may receive on this head from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient, &c., 
</p><p>
