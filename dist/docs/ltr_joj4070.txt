Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 25th September came to my hands in 
England on the 8th December last ; and since my return, 
I have received that of the 7th November, which, though 
containing only three lines, I prefer to most of the others. 
Perhaps you have forgot it. 
</p><p>
" It is now within three minutes of the time when the 
mail is made up and sent off. I cannot, therefore, do more 
than just to assure you of the continuance of my love, 
Adieu. Yours, 
</p><p>
"G. M." 
</p><p>
That this letter was so short, I ascribe to procrastination ; that it was written at all, I ascribe to your heart : 
your head evidently had no concern in it ; for, if consulted, 
it would have intimated that they who live near a post office, find no good excuse for singular brevity in the mail's 
being to be sent off in a few minutes after they sit down to 
write, unless, indeed, some circumstance just occurred should 
make the subject of the letter. But, be that as it may, I 
would rather receive one little effusion from your heart 
than twenty from your head, though I hope to derive much 
pleasure from both. We shall have much to say to each 
other, and I think both of us will be gainers by it. Why I 
think so, must not be discussed in letters, whose seals will 
not be respected.

You suppose that ill health induces me to resign. You 
are mistaken. It seldom happens that any measure is 
prompted by one single motive, though one among others 
may sometimes have decisive weight and influence. Many 
motives induce me to resign ; but of those many there is 
one which predominates, and that is this - When I embarked in the public service, I said very sincerely that I 
quitted private life with regret, and should be happy to 
return to it when the objects which called me from it should 
be attained. You know what those objects were, and that, 
on the peace, they ceased to operate. To be consistent, 
therefore, I must retire. The motive is irresistible. Superadded to this are the education of my son, the attention I 
owe to the unfortunate part of my family, and the happiness I expect from rejoining my friends. Pecuniary considerations ever held a secondary place in my estimation. 1 
know how to live within the limits of any income, however 
narrow ; and my pride is not of a nature to be hurt by 
returning to the business which I formerly followed : but 
professions of this sort are common, and facts only can give 
unequivocal evidence of their sincerity. 
</p><p>
I have passed between three and four sad months in 
England. Bad weather and bad health almost the whole 
time. On my arrival, a dysentery and fever brought me 
low, and a sore-throat, which still plagues me, succeeded. 
Bath has done me good, for it removed the pain in my 
breast, which has been almost constant for eighteen months. 
</p><p>
I had many excellent opportunities of writing to my 
friends from London and Bristol, but I was enjoined to 
abstain as much as possible from pen and ink. 
</p><p>
It is natural that you should expect to find some news in 
this letter. I will tell you a little, though it is probable that 
your sagacity has prevented its being unexpected. The 
institution of the Order of Cincinnatus does not, in the 
opinion of the wisest men whom I have heard speak on the 
subject, either do credit to those who formed and patronised, 
or to those who suffered it. 
</p><p>
I am indebted to our excellent friend, Robert Morris, for 
a very obliging letter. He shall soon hear from me. In 
the mean time, let him share with you in this adieu. 
</p><p>
Yours sincerely, 
</p><p>
