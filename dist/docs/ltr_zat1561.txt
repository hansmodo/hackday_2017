My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
I wrote you a few days since immediately on my return here from 
Victoria, where I had intend to have remained a short time to have 
recruited a little after being I may [say] constantly in the saddle for six 
weeks ; & until <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> left the Brasos taking with him what portion 
of the force in my rear, he might think proper, after striping me in front 
& on my flanks, so that I might make the best disposition I might deem 
most advisable for the defence of the enemies country we have taken 
possession of; but information from the advance at Saltillo 60 or 70 
miles in front of this place, which is that Majr Gaines 1 accompanied by 
Cap c C. M. Clay & his company, & Majr Borland with Capt Donally & 
comfy the first K mounted men, the latter Arkensas regt in all 80 or 90 
men who were sent out on the San Luis Potosi road, to gain intelligence 
of the movements & position of the enemy, had been surprised, killed 
or made prisoners, not one escaping to tell the news ; this is official ; & 
an other report has this moment reached me, that an other corny of the 
same reg f had the day after been captured, alth coming from high 
authority, it is a report only, & I sincerely hope is untrue ; be this as 
it may, I shall leave at day light to-morrow, for that portion of the army 
left me with a reenforcement of 700 men, & hope if it has been lost, to 
restore confidence among them if possible. It is reported also that, the 
enemy are in force principally cavalry, in the vicinity of Saltillo with large 
reenforcements on the way to join them from San Luis Potosi. Be this 
as it may, should they offer us battle I shall indulge them, be the con 
sequences what they may. We now begin to see the fruits of the arrange 
ments recently made at Washington, by an intrigue of Marcey, Scott & 
Worth to take from me nearly the whole of the regular forces under my 
command, while in the immediate front of the enemy if not in their 
presance 
</p><p>
By a mail which reached here last night, by which I rec d nothing 
public or private, bringing papers from the East, Washington dates up 
to the first ins 1 it seems that great changes are contemplated in the army, 
not on by adding a number of additional regular troops, but that the 
office of L l Gen will be recommended by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a>, which will be 
confirred on Thos H. Benton should a law to the effect be passed by 
congress ; if all this is done I for one will not complain, after the manner 
I have been treated. But enough on this subject, & I have at any rate 
not time to say more 
</p><p>
Inclosed you will find five hund dollars in treasury notes which 
please hold on to for one year as they bear an interest of five per cent, or 
if you think best invest the same in any other way for the benefit of Ann 
& the children or rather the latter 
</p><p>
If Col Taylor & Bob are still with you remember me to them most 
</p><p>
kindly 
</p><p>
With respect & esteem 
</p><p>
Your Friend Truly
