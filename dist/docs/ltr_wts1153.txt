My Dear Brother: The fall of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> and consequent capitulation of Port Hudson, the opening the 
navigation of the Mississippi, and now the driving out 
of this great valley the only strong army that threatened 
us, complete as pretty a page in the history of war and 
of our country as ever you could ask my name to be 
identified with. The share I have personally borne in 
all these events is one in which you may take pride for 
me. You know I have avoided notoriety ; and the press, 
my standard enemy, may strip me of all popular applause, but not a soldier of the Army of the Tennessee 
but knows the part I have borne in this great drama, and 
the day will come when that army will speak in a voice 
that cannot be drowned. . . . 
</p><p>
In the events resulting thus, the guiding minds and 
hands were Grant's," Sherman's, and McPherson's, all 
natives of Ohio. . . . 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=jackson" rel="city">Jackson</a> will never again be a point where an enemy 
can assemble and threaten us. ... As soon as my 
detachments are in, I will return to Black River. Our 
men and officers must have rest. For months in trenches, 
working day and night in the heat and dust of the roads, 
all - are exhausted and need rest. I hope the Army of 
the Potomac will finish <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel rel="">Lee</a>. Morgan should not escape 
from Indiana. Love to all. 
</p><p>
Your brother, 
</p><p>
W. T. SHEBMAN.
