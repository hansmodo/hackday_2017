It has not been without difficulty that the ardour of the popular Societies has been suppressed by the superior energy of their new ally's friendly counsels. These popular 
Societies seem destined every where to grow as a monstrous wen upon the body of Liberty. In this country there is scarce a town or village ever so small in which they have 
not sprung up since the Revolution ; but hitherto they have been harmless, because they have been impotent. When 
the French armies entered the province of Holland, the commissioners of the Convention published a proclamation promising to respect the independence of the Batavian 
people, but declaring at the same time that they would repress all excesses between the inhabitants. The only occasions upon which they have been obliged to carry this determination into effect has been furnished by the popular Societies. 
</p><p>
It has been more than once proposed to me, and even urged upon me to become a member of that which has been formed in this place. I have excused myself upon the 
ground of being a stranger, and of the impropriety which I should commit in taking any part personally in the politics of the country. This answer has been sufficient, but not 
satisfactory. The Patriots here say that they are our only friends ; that the Orange party detest us, and therefore that we are not equitable in preserving a neutrality between them. 
</p><p>
As to the dispositions of the Orangeists, there is too much truth in the assertion of their adversaries. The Court party, and all the former governing party here, never look upon 
the United States but with eyes of terror and aversion, sometimes shaded with a veil of affected indifference, and sometimes attempted to be disguised under a mask of respect 
and veneration. I speak not of an universal sentiment. There are exceptions among the thinking and respectable 
part of the faction ; but my reference is to the general sentiment of that class. I have had repeated opportunities of 
observing it, and if the situation of the whole party had been such as to admit of any sentiment relative to them but compassion, I believe I should have been disposed before this 
</p><p>
to return them all their gall, and to exult in the foundation 
of their fears. But their humiliations, from the time when 
I arrived to this day, have been such as would disarm any 
enmity but that of party. I have therefore invariably 
avoided every act that could be charged with partiality 
favorable to the Patriots, as against the others, not from 
regard to them, but to my own duty. 
</p><p>
It was, therefore, unnecessary for me to look for motives 
to justify my refusal, to the principles upon which I have an 
aversion to political popular Societies in general. To destroy an established power these Societies are undoubtedly 
an efficacious instrument. But in their nature they are fit 
for nothing else, and the reign of Robespierre has shewn 
what use they make of power when they obtain its exercise. . . . 
</p><p>
Our American Jacobins, I imagine, will be puzzled to fix 
upon their creed as to French affairs. I question whether 
they will give at full length the debates in the Convention 
of the present time. If they do, you will perceive that 
Jacobin Clubs, Sans Culottism, Demagogic (if we have no 
word to express this idea, it is not for want of the thing,) 
and all the madness and all the hypocrisy, which it was so 
long a fashion to profess and to admire, are now rated at 
their true value. There is however one fundamental 
political error, from which France has not yet recovered ; 
it is the unqualified submission, and the unwise veneration 
for the opinion publique, which is in its nature inconsistent 
with any regular permanent system of government or of 
policy. Until they have the courage to explode this doc 
trine, they will not only be without a constitution, but 
totally destitute of the means of forming one. . . .
