MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The most compendious method to give you an idea 
of the state of your Province, is to inclose to you 
the result of a Council of Officers, every article of 
which is approved by your Convention. We have 
just received an express from North Carolina, informing  us of the arrival of eight large transports in 
Cape Fear River, in the whole containing, as it is 
supposed, about two thousand men. I had before, on 
a suspicion of their arrival, detached a battalion of 
riflemen, and shall set out myself the day after tomorrow. 
The Convention has ordered twelve hundred militia 
or minute-men to that Province. My command, as 
you may easily conceive, is extremely perplexing 
from the consideration of the vast extent of the 
valuable parts of this country, intersected by such a 
variety of navigable waters, and the expedition with 
which the enemy, furnished with canvas wings, can 
fly from one spot to another. Had we arms for the 
minute-men, and half a dozen good field engineers, we 
might laugh at their efforts; but in this article (like 
the rest of the Continent) we are miserably deficient. 
Engineers we have but two ; and they threaten to 
resign, as it is impossible that they should subsist 
on a more wretched pittance than common carpenters 
or bricklayers can earn. I have written to the congress, entreating them to augment the pay. A word 
from you would, I make no doubt, effect it. 
</p><p>
I wish, my dear General, you would send me Captain Smith, on condition Congress make it worth his 
while ; otherwise, I have not the conscience to propose it. I am well pleased with your officers in 
general, and the men are good, some Irish rascals 
excepied. I have formed two companies of grenadiers to each regiment, and with spears of thirteen 
feet long. Their rifles (for they are all riflemen) 
sling over their shoulders ; their appearance is formidable, and the men are conciliated to the weapon. I 
am likewise furnishing myself with four-ounced rifle-amusettes, which will carry an infernal distance ; the 
two-ounced hit a half sheet of paper five hundred 
yards distant. So much for military. 
</p><p>
A noble spirit possesses the Convention. They are 
almost unanimous for independence, but differ in their 
sentiments about the mode ; two days will decide it. 
I have the pleasure to inform you that I am extremely well in the opinion of the senatorial part, as 
well as of the people at large. God send me grace 
to preserve it ! But their neighbours of Maryland (I 
mean their Council of Safety) make a most damnable 
clamor (as I am informed) on the subject of a letter 
I wrote to the Chairman of the Committee of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, to seize the person and papers of Mr. Eden, 
upon the discovery which was communicated to me 
of his treacherous correspondence with the Secretary 
of State. It was a measure not only justifiable in 
the eyes of God and men, but absolutely necessary. 
The Committee of Safety here are indeed as deep in 
the scrape as myself. The Congress must, and will, 
I dare say, support and vindicate the measure. 
</p><p>
Captain Green and his party are upon their march, 
as you ordered. I was a d d blockhead for bringing  them so far, as their accounts will be intricate ; 
but I hope not so intricate as not to be unriddled. 
I send you an account of the money I advanced to 
the different officers, to Captains Smith, Lunt, and 
Green. I have taken the liberty to appoint a sergeant Denmark, of the Rifle battalion, to do duty as 
Ensign. lie is a man of worth, and I beg you 
will confirm his commission. Another Sergeant, of 
the same battalion, I have promoted to the rank of 
second Lieutenant in the Artillery of this Province. 
He is a German, his name Holmer, and very deserving . If little Eustace cannot be provided for with 
you, I could wish, if there is a cheap method of doing  it, you would send him to me, as I have it in 
my power to please him, and quite doat upon him. 
</p><p>
My love to Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, Gates, and her bad 
half, to Moylan; but Palfrey is a scoundrel for not 
writing. Adieu, my dear General. 
</p><p>
Yours, most entirely, 
</p><p>
