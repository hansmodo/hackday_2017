MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
THERE has been a very general apprehension during 
the last week, that a general action would happen as 
on yesterday, but we hear of none. Our army is en 
camped between Newport and White Clay Creek, on 
advantageous ground. The General has harangued 
his army, and published in general orders, in order to 
prepare their minds for something great, and has held 
up the example of Stark, Herkimer, Gansevoort and 
their troops to animate his officers and men with emulation. Whether he expects to be attacked, or 
whether he designs to offend, I can t say. 
</p><p>
A general action which should terminate in a defeat 
of Howe, would be complete and final ruin to him. 
If it should terminate only in a drawn battle, it would 
be the same thing. If he should gain a victory and 
, maintain possession of the field, he would lose so 
many men killed and wounded, that he would scarcely 
have enough left to march to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, surrounded as he would be with militia and the broken 
remains of the continental army. But if there should 
be no general battle, and the two armies should 
lounge away the remainder of the campaign in silent 
inactivity, gazing at each other, Howe's reputation 
would be ruined in his own country and in all Europe, 
and the dread of him would cease in all America. 
The American mind, which, I think, has more firmness now, than it ever had before, since this war be 
gan, would acquire a confidence and strength, that all 
the efforts of Great Britain afterwards would not be 
able to relax. 
</p><p>
You will see by the papers enclosed that we have 
been obliged to attempt to humble the pride of some 
Jesuits, who call themselves Quakers,but who love 
money and land better than liberty or religion. The 
hypocrites are endeavoring to raise the cry of persecution, and to give this matter a religious turn, but 
they can t succeed. The world knows them and 
their communications. Actuated by a land-jobbing 
spirit like that of William Penn, they have been solicking grants of immense regions of land on the 
Ohio. American independence has disappointed them, 
which makes them hate it. Yet the dastards dare not 
avow their hatred to it, it seems. 
</p><p>
The moments are critical here. We know not but 
the next will bring us an account of a general engagement begun, and when once begun, we know not how 
it will end, for the battle is not always to the strong. 
The events of war are uncertain. All that we can do 
is to pray, as I do most devoutly, that we may be victorious ; at least, that we may not be vanquished. 
Bat if it should be the will of Heaven that our army 
should be defeated, our artillery lost, our best generals killed, and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> fall into Mr. Howe's hands, 
still America is not conquered. America would yet 
be possessed of great resources, and capable of great 
exertions, as mankind would see. It may, for what I 
know be the design of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> that this should be 
the case. Because it would only lay the foundations 
of American independence deeper, and cement them 
stronger. It would cure Americans of their vicious 
and luxurious and effeminate appetites, passions and 
habits, a more dangerous army to American liberty 
than Mr. Howe's. 
</p><p>
However, without the loss of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> we must 
be brought to an entire renunciation of foreign commodities, at least of West India produce. People are 
coming to this resolution very fast here. Loaf sugar 
at four dollars a pound, wine at three dollars a bottle, 
&c., will soon introduce economy in the use of these 
articles. This spirit of economy would be more terrible to Great Britain than any thing else, and it would 
make us more respectable in the eyes of all Europe. 
Instead of acrimonious altercations between town and 
country, and between farmer and merchant, I wish 
that my dear countrymen would agree in this virtuous 
resolution of depending on themselves alone. Let 
them make salt and live without sugar and rurn. 
</p><p>
I am grieved to hear of the angry contentions 
among you. That improvident act for limiting prices has done great injury, and in my sincere opinion, 
if not repealed, will ruin the State, and introduce a 
civil war. I know not how unpopular this sentiment 
may be, but it is sincerely mine. There are rascally 
upstarts in trade, I doubt not, who have made great 
fortunes in a small period, who are monopolizing 
and oppressing. But how this can be avoided entirely, I know not, but by disusing their goods, and 
letting them perish in their hands.
