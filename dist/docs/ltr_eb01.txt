Happy Birthday Son,<br>
57 years ago in the Cottage Hospt. I was told I had a son. I named him Daniel 
after two wonderful characters. [Unintelligible] through the years I have felt when
I needed you I would get a response. I have prayed you would live up to your name.
There is a song that goes like this 'dare to be a Daniel'. It would be a pleasure untold
if you were to tell me you planned to meet me on the beautiful shore. I am very lonely
here among so many whose mind is gone over, thank God I know where I am. My room is nice and I can
still dress my self and wheel around though my hip keeps me in the wheel chair mostly and I neither
see very well. I seldom see Ruth ot the girls any more. The food here is seldom any thing desirable,
poor help. They are training some new aids which I hope will be better. The one I liked that teased
you found a better job and left. Steve went to Sac. The others do as little as possible. Happy b.d.
I hope. Jackie says she will come to see me the 28th of May.<br>
All my love,<br>
Mother.
