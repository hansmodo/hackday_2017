Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This is the first moment I have found myself 
able to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's 
obliging letter of the 11th ultimo, and to express 
the grateful sense I entertain of the concern which 
you are so kindly pleased to express for my recovery. The severity of my disorder had so far abated 
as to enable me to leave my room, and attempt a 
little moderate exercise ; but, after two or three days, 
it was succeeded by a slow fever, attended with a 
disagreeable cough and depression of spirits, which 
came upon me every afternoon, and continued until 
morning. Its long continuance has reduced me very 
low, and my recovery is almost imperceptible, so that 
I have little reason speedily to expect a return of 
my usual health. 
I am sorry to learn, that the peace establishment 
is so long delayed ; though it is what I expected, nor 
do I believe one will ever be agreed upon that will 
give respectability to the nation, and security to the 
frontiers. Some States appear now to be exceedingly 
jealous of the Confederation ; and, I observe, even 
towns are giving instructions to their representatives 
to guard against any infringement of it. It would 
become them to reflect, that, not long since, when it 
suited their interest and their humor, a violation of 
it, in a very essential instance, was so far from being 
disagreeable, that it was strongly advocated by those 
States who now appear the most scrupulous. I am 
fully persuaded, unless the powers of the National 
Council are enlarged, and that body better supported 
than it is at present, all their measures will discover 
such feebleness and want of energy, as will stain us 
with disgrace, and expose us to the worst of evils. 
</p><p>
We have as yet no certainty when the British will 
leave the southern district of this State, though all 
accounts agree that their stay will not exceed the 
10th of next month. As my correspondence with 
Sir Guy, since your Excellency left this quarter, has 
ceased, I " am something apprehensive that he may 
not give me timely notice, as he promised to do in 
his first letter, for the establishment of the jurisdiction of the State over that district on his departure; 
and disorders will consequently take place, before measures can be taken by the State to prevent them. I 
could wish, therefore, that the troops on the lines in 
Westchester county might have orders to move to 
the neighbourhood of the city the moment the British 
leave it, and, if there should be no impropriety in it, 
be subject to my direction while they remain there. 
And I would be much obliged to your Excellency, if you will be pleased to inform me by express (the 
expense whereof the State will cheerfully pay), of the 
first advice you may receive of the time proposed by 
Sir Guy for his departure.

We were under much anxiety on hearing of Mrs. 
Washington's indisposition, and were made extremely 
happy by your account of her recovery. Mrs. Clinton 
joins me in requesting you to accept and to tender 
to Mrs. Washington our most respectful compliments. 
I am, with the highest sentiments of respect and 
esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">George Clinton</a>.

P. S. Your Excellency will be pleased to excuse 
this scroll's not appearing in my own hand. I attempted to copy it, but found it too much for me.
