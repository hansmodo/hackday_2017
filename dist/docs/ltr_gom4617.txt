Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
If I have not hitherto mentioned the application made to 
me by the foreign officers, who have certificates, whereof the 
interest is payable in this city, it has not been for want of 
sufficient reason, but because I daily hoped to have received 
some orders on that subject.  Many have spoken to me, 
written to me, and called upon me. I have given to all the 
general assurances, that justice would be done, that I would 
transmit their claims, and the like. I now enclose a letter 
from the Polish Envoy, relative to the claims of Brigadier 
General Kosciuszko, and I have told the Count d Oraczewski 
that I daily expect despatches from you on this subject. I 
did this because General Duportail told me, that he had information from Colonel Ternant, that these claims are honorably 
provided for. In the uncertainty as to what may have been 
done, I feel it my duty to bring the matter to your recollection, persuaded that you will do everything which may be proper on the occasion. 
</p><p>
I enclose, in like manner, a letter I have received from 
Mr Francis Coffin of Dunkirk, respecting the Consular office 
in that city. I tell him in answer to it, that I shall inquire of 
M. de Lamotte as to the appointment he complains of, and 
will transmit his letter to you, and take your orders. These 
you will, I trust, be so kind as to give me. I know not Mr Coffin, and consequently can say nothing either for or against 
him. I am, &;c.
