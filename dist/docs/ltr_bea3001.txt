MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
My last, of the 20th ultimo, from Point-aux-Trem-bles, advising of my retiring from before Quebec, I 
make no doubt your Excellency has received. I continued at <a href='/results.php?city=point-aux-trembles' rel='city'>Point-aux-Trembles</a> until the 3d instant, 
when, to my great joy, <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a> joined us, 
with artillery, and about three hundred men. Yesterday we arrived here, and are making all possible preparation to attack the city, which has a wretched 
motley garrison of disaffected seamen, marines, and 
inhabitants ; the walls in a ruinous situation, and can 
not hold out long. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a return of my detachment, amounting 
to six hundred and seventy-five men, for whom I have 
received clothing of <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a>. I hope 
there will soon be provision made for paying the 
soldiers arrearages, as many of them have families 
who are in want. A continual hurry has prevented 
my sending a continuation of my journal. I am, with 
very great respect, your Excellency's

Most obedient humble servant,
