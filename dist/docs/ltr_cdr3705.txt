Sir, 
</p><p>
The legion of Lauzun had began to march, when very cold weather came on, and the ground was covered with snow six inches deep. As, by the intelligences I had from your Excellency, and those I got 
from the flag, it appears that the reenforcement from 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> does not exceed thirteen 
hundred men, I have not judged this rapid movement 
of the legion quite necessary, when, in these melted 
snows, all its equipments, both of horse and foot, 
would have been utterly spoiled; and therefore have 
ordered it into its quarters again, until the weather 
be milder. In the mean time, I hope I shall receive 
your Excellency's answer. 
</p><p>
The news I had from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> by the flag are, 
that all the men-of-war under sixty-four are gone, a 
month since, to join Admiral Hood ; that there remain only at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> the Lion, commanded by Digby, some fifty and forty-gun ships, and several 
frigates. That is quite sufficient to keep the Romulus in awe. They brag, likewise, at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, of an 
immediate large reenforcement from Ireland, with the 
same particulars of two regiments of dismounted dragoons. Though I have not the least faith in it, I 
believe it would be necessary, before we come to 
any resolution, to know whether this storm will take 
its direction to the northward or towards the south. 
It is the same report which was spread in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
and which has alarmed <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. 
</p><p>
As your Excellency's answer might be long coming, 
by reason of the rivers being full of floating ice, and 
of our not having had any intercourse with the Northern States this fortnight past, I have resolved to send 
back to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> all the convalescents, which it 
will be possible to assemble, that they may be exchanged against our convalescents of the West India 
brigade, taken in the Bonetta. I believe it will be 
better for both to return among their countrymen, 
there to receive the assistance they stand in need of 
I am, with respect and personal attachment. Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
