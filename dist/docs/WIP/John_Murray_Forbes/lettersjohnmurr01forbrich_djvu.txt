PREFACE 

ABOUT twelve years ago my father put together 
in manuscript a couple of volumes of reminiscences 
of his life ; and these, together with a vast collec 
tion of letters to him, press copies of letters from 
him, and other papers, he left in my charge, mainly 
that I might make selections from the whole and 
put them into more definite form for his grand 
children. 

I am led to believe, however, that his life and 
character were exceptional enough to make some 
account of him of general interest. With the view 
of giving this to the public I have made extracts 
from such parts of his notes as seem to be to the 
purpose, and have selected from the letters and 
papers those which explain and give color to the 
scenes and events recalled. In a preliminary chap 
ter I have given some general description of my 
father s habits and characteristics, such as may help 
a reader who did not know him the better to under 
stand what follows. I publish these things as the 
record of an American citizen who, keeping himself

in the background, never stinted work, or money, 
or service of any sort, for the country he loved so 
well. 

I wish to return most grateful thanks to all the 
relatives, now surviving, of my father s correspond 
ents, who have kindly permitted the use of letters 
written to him. Above all, I wish to record my 
deep obligation to Professor J. B. Thayer, to whom 
I am indebted for all legal notes ; and for endless 
kindness and help, in more ways than I can here 
enumerate, in the preparation of this work.

"I said never was such force, good meaning, good sense, good 
action, combined with such domestic lovely behavior, such modesty 
and persistent preference for others. Wherever he moved he was 
the benefactor. It is of course that he should ride well, shoot well, 
sail well, keep house well, administer affairs well ; but he was the 
best talker, also, in the company : what with a perpetual practical 
wisdom, with an eye always to the working of the thing, what with 
the multitude and distinction of his facts (and one detected continu 
ally that he had a hand in everything that has been done), and in 
the temperance with which he parried all offense and opened the 
eyes of the person he talked with without contradicting him. Yet I 
said to myself, How little this man suspects, with his sympathy for 
men and his respect for lettered and scientific people, that he is not 
likely, in any company, to meet a man superior to himself. And I 
think this is a good country that can bear such a creature as he is."

LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

OF 

JOHN MURRAY FORBES 



CHAPTER I 

INTRODUCTION 

IT is usual to give some account of a man s ances 
tors when beginning the story of his life ; but in 
the present instance a memory of my father s feel 
ing about the matter prevents my following such a 
precedent at any length. 

No one ever spent less time in hunting up remote 
forbears than John Murray Forbes. His life was 
too full for such researches, which he declared were 
always likely to disclose facts quite as well forgot 
ten ; summing up his verdict with the proverb, 
" Let sleeping dogs lie." For instance, among the 
family traditions is one of a Robert Forbes who was 
said to have won his bride, Kate Cameron, by obey 
ing her behest and killing her father s slayer, and 
then to have married her, red-handed from the fray. 
Of this and similar ancestors my father only re 
marked, when they were mentioned, that they were 



2 JOHN MURRAY L FORBES 

probably a set of old cattle thieves; and he took 
no trouble to find out how successful their forays 
might have been. Friends in Scotland have sent 
us an account of one Robert Bennet who, according 
to authentic records, bore fine and imprisonment 
from 1662 to 1681 and paid first 1200 and after 
wards various other fines, amounting altogether to 
5000 " marks/ rather than give up going to hear 
the "Kevd. John Blackadder" and other beloved 
covenanting preachers, and receiving them at his 
house when, during brief periods of governmental 
leniency, he was not in the Tolbooth gaol. This an 
cestor would have had my father s hearty approval ; 
but although he may have inherited from him much 
of his determination of purpose and habit of carry 
ing out his resolutions at all cost, I fear that he 
would not have followed the old covenanter in any 
martyrdom which necessitated the hearing of long 
sermons on bleak hillsides. 

However, I believe, although he would scarcely 
have admitted it, that the well known Scotch feel 
ing of "pride in being a Scotchman" lay hidden 
in a corner of his heart. Be this as it may, at least 
one trait came to him from the old Highland clan, 
namely, an intense interest in all his relatives far 
and near, and a feeling of his responsibility towards 
them to the sixth generation. The thought of a 
relation s becoming bankrupt was horrible to him, 
and many a plunge he took into distasteful business 
in order to prevent such a catastrophe, or to remedy 
it, as far as possible, if it had already occurred. 



INTRODUCTION 3 

The Forbeses and Bennets were united in America 
by the marriage, in 1769, of Dorothy Murray (whose 
mother was Barbara Bennet) and John Forbes, 
then of Florida but originally of Deskrie, Scotland, 
and this couple were the parents of Ralph Bennet 
Forbes, and grandparents of my father, John Mur 
ray Forbes. His mother was Margaret Perkins, 
and her people, to some of whom he owed his start 
in life, he valued and loved; but for all this he 
could never refrain from repeating a joke of his 
cousin, James Sturgis, apropos of a common an 
cestress on that side who had, according to Mr. 
Sturgis, made her grocery shop successful by in 
serting a large thumb into all her measures as she 
served her customers. 1 As a matter of fact this 
lady (nee Elizabeth Peck), who had been left a 
widow early in life, with eight small children to 
bring up, had by most honorable means transformed 
the wholesale part of the grocery business left by 
her husband into one of large and general com 
merce, and had bequeathed this to her sons; and 
her character and ability had my father s warm 

1 The following epitaph on the father of the ancestress referred to 
has been sent me by another cousin, Mr. J. Elliot Cabot : 

Here lies a Peck, who, some men say, 
Was first of all a Peck of clay. 
This, formed by Hand Divine, while fresh, 
Became a common Peck of flesh. 

Full forty years Peck felt life s bubbles, 
Till death relieved a Peck of troubles. 
And here he lies, as all men must, 
Though nothing but a Peck of dust. 



4 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

esteem. Nevertheless, any hint of pride in ancestry, 
and through that in merits not one s own, would be 
sure to produce the profane story of the thumb. 

For all this he was a man of the strongest family 
affection. In his own immediate circle he was, 
throughout life, all that one could be to his rela 
tives. 

For his grandmother Dorothy s sister, Mrs. Eliza 
beth Murray Bobbins, and her kind husband, he 
had a grateful regard, saying that she stood in his 
grandmother s place to him. 1 And as she had de 
lighted him by gifts of pill-boxes filled with small 
silver pieces, so he in his old age kept an assort 
ment of like boxes for all sorts of little people, in 
memory of the pleasure she had given him so long 
ago ; after his death we found a bag of change and 
numberless little plush boxes ready for use. In all 
this good aunt s family, down to her great-grand 
children, he kept a deep interest, and would dwell 
constantly on Judge Bobbins s kindness, or enu 
merate the virtues of his cousins, Mary Kevere and 
Sally Howe, or smile over recollections of the pithy 
stories of their sister, Mrs. Lyman. And then he 
would mention with pleasure some good trait he 
had observed in their descendants. 

Impatient, to a degree, of sloth, incompetency, 
and above all hypocrisy, I have seen him among 
kith and kin, and those who had any claim on him, 

1 Dorothy Murray Forbes died in 1811, two years before J. M. 
F. s birth, after having been a cripple, from rheumatic gout, for 
nearly thirty years. 



INTRODUCTION 5 

exhibit an endless patience and long-suffering with 
the foibles most distasteful to him ; so that a cousin 
who had had many opportunities of watching him 
under very trying circumstances once exclaimed, 
" The most patient impatient man I have ever 



seen ! " 



It cannot be denied, however, that my father 
could be a good hater, and when once this feeling 
was excited he seemed never to be able to tolerate 
the persons who inspired it, often expending on 
them more thought than they were worth. As a 
rule this sentiment was confined to public charac 
ters of whose conduct and record he disapproved. 
Especially he detested sanctimonious rogues, or in 
fact pretense of any kind, whether of patriotism or 
religion. Toleration of newspapers which spread 
" bad doctrine," financial or political, or increased 
their circulation by personal scandals, was not 
among his virtues. His estimate of one of this or 
der, which had attacked his business honor, was 
shown by his characteristic reply to some friends 
who had urged him at once to vindicate himself : 

" When the New York praises me, I shall 

sue it for libel, not before." 

My father s really active business life in this 
country began on his return from China in the 
middle of the financial panic of 1837, but it was 
not till 1860, when the war cloud, so long in gath 
ering, was about to burst, that the inordinate work 
began which I remember as going on continuously 
from that date. But whether busy or comparatively 



6 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

idle, he still found time for irksome duties to his 
children, and would walk the floor all night with an 
ailing, wide-awake baby, crooning old songs to it, 
and watching for the cold winter s dawn to refresh 
himself with bath and breakfast, and then to his 
work in Boston. Before 1860 he had at least pe 
riods of leisure. He would go to his office in Bos 
ton early, return to Milton for dinner (also early), 
and drive with my mother afterwards, or ride with 
my sisters, mounted on his favorite horse Prince. 
And later on, when I was still quite a small child, 
he would often call me to a delightful game of hide 
and seek among the pine-trees behind the house; 
and when winter came he would appear with a won 
derful pair of skates which he had had made with 
double runners, " to make him secure " as he said, 
and with these on his feet would teach me to skate 
on one of the meadows which he had had flooded 
by damming the brook that flowed through it ; and 
so on this eminently safe pond we struggled about 
until the desired end was attained. Besides making 
the pond itself, he had built a large settle, with a 
high back, where we could put on and take off our 
skates and rest, sheltered from the north wind, a 
comfort for which we all were grateful, and the 
conception of which was very characteristic of him 
self. He always held it to be bad economy for any 
one to submit to a discomfort which could be rea 
sonably avoided. 

Afterward there was little of this leisure in Mil 
ton. The storm and stress had begun, and, al- 



INTRODUCTION 7 

though we all knew then, more or less, that he was 
hard-worked, it brings now a feeling of exhaustion 
to look through the letters and papers of those 
years and realize for the first time the amount and 
variety of work which must have been got through. 
I do not undertake to catalogue the immense mass 
of this material ; the following pages will speak for 
themselves. 

During the most exciting periods of the war 
letters were begun at six o clock in the morning. 
After breakfast, rain or shine, he rode into Boston, 
and back to dinner. Then a short nap, and work 
until supper, followed by a game of cards ; after 
which, work again until far into the night, some 
times until three o clock the next morning. On 
other occasions all day would be spent in Boston. 
I can recollect my mother s anxiety over it all ; and 
yet the work was to be done ! He was often so 
weary that he would say he wished he could do 
something to get shut up in jail, as " the only place 
where he could be sure of rest." 

He never liked it to be known that he wrote 
editorials, or inspired editors with his views, or that 
he drew up bills for congressmen ; and he always 
declined any nomination for office. " Let them feel 
that I want nothing but the good of the country, 
and then I shall be trusted : if it is fancied that I 
work for any personal end I shall lose influence." 
And again, " Never mind who does it or gets the 
credit for it so long as the thing is done." 

Any number of men, statesmen, men of the army 



: JOHX MURRAY FORBES 

and navy. aifiiiijfW men- business men having to do 
with steamboats, railroads, newspapers, and polities, 
were constantly invited bj my father to his house. 
I can recollect an endfcsR succession of them, from 
Emerson, \msm- Wvman. Sumner. Andrew. Fes- 



fgmlfmj Chase, Cobden. Goldwin Smith, and James 
Brvce. to men whose names were never heard of 

* 

out of their own business. All were made wel 
come ; all who were in earnest were warmly re 
ceived- His way of imparting his ideas to these 
various guests was verv characteristic. Often he 



would grasp with his left hand the right arm of the 
person to be convinced and walk him off. earnestly 
talking, and emphasizing any telling point with a 
stroke executed in the air with the forefinger of his 
right hand. This forefinger so marked his sen 
tences that one watched it, involuntarily, and grew 
quite sure that the views he tried to impress were 
being successfully driven home to the mind of his 
bearer by means of it. 

I think that one of my father s strong points in 
his dealings with all sorts and conditions of men 
was his power of drawing out all they had in them 
of interest. This gift he sometimes humorously 
brought to bear on the modern newspaper reporter. 
On one of our Western trips, when we had Mr. 
Emerson with us and stopped at Salt Lake City, one 
of these gentlemen boarded our car and wanted my 
father s "impressions of the West," etc. He was 
received very pleasantly ; but to our great amuse 
ment we soon found the reporter giving hi* views 



INTRODUCTION 9 

of the West, and my father listening with interest 
and attention, and continuing to ply him with ques 
tions till the end of the interview. The gentleman 
of the press went away much pleased, but without 
having discovered that we had the " Seer of Con 
cord" with us, and quite in the dark as to Mr. 
Forbes s views on any subject. 

But perhaps his strongest point was his power of 
" putting through " work. No obstacle seemed to 
daunt him, failure only to stimulate to fresh exer 
tion. He used to declare that he was the laziest of 
men. We did not see it ! When, to his peculiar 
disappointment, General Butler was chosen gov 
ernor of Massachusetts, he only said, " We must 
work harder next time ; " and while strength lasted 
he never thought the removal of a poor official, 
representative, or senator, too great an undertaking. 
No political machine ever made him fear to set 
about such a business. 1 " We must appeal to the 
people," he would say; and with "Broadsides" and 
the " Spirit of the Campaign " (printed sheets con 
taining articles from the best newspapers in the 
country) he would bombard local editors and post 
masters, and through them the people, in his own 
and other States. " People," he insisted, " must be 
taught to think." Eeady to own himself wrong, if 
so proved, yet, meantime, he had an intense belief 

1 See letter of October 29, 1884 (at page 207 of vol. ii.), to the 
Independents. In another letter to them, written during the same 
month, he says : " Better make a thousand mistakes in your method 
of action than to stand supinely and let the ship of state drift on, or 
be entirely in the hands of hack politicians." 



10 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

in his own convictions, which brought victory in 
many a hard-fought field. 

That he impressed others with his power of carry 
ing his point is clear from many of the letters to 
him which I have read. The Kev. W. G. Eliot, of 
St. Louis, wanting help in getting colored troops 
enlisted, and in strengthening General Schofield s 
hands in this matter, writes, "Your coming here 
would do great good. You are a perfect firebrand. 
Come prepared to speak for the powers if you can, 
and get the bounty for the negro recruits, if possi 
ble ;" and Mr. John Earl Williams, of the New 
York Metropolitan Bank, writes on the same sub 
ject, " What do I think about your going to St. 
Louis ? Go by all means ; don t fail to do it. Per 
haps you know Schofield; but lest you may not I 
inclose a line to him, which, of course, I know 
to be unnecessary, as you will have St. Louis, 
Schofield, and all, under your command twenty-four 
hours after you get there ! " And finally, Mr. 
Robinson, the newspaper correspondent known as 
" Warrington," in one of his " Pen Portraits " gives 
the following account of my father s methods of 
work at this time : " It is curious to see a meeting 
of the Committee on the Enlistment of Colored 
Troops. John M. Forbes is its chairman, a man of 
headlong energy, long time an abolitionist, and 
more than any other man the confidential adviser 
and helper of Governor Andrew. He attends to 
everything ; writes letters, raises money (liberally 
contributing himself), sends messages to Washing- 



INTRODUCTION 11 

ton to direct and organize congressional opinion, 
makes or persuades editors to write leading articles 
to enforce his views, hunts up members of Congress 
in vacation time, dines them at the club, and sends 
them back full of practical suggestions, which reap 
pear in bills and resolves the month after." 

Amidst the intense labor before, during, and 
after the civil war, I never knew how my father 
found time to give so much thought to his children 
as he did. A wise counselor, tender, patient friend, 
and cheery comrade, he was to us, one and all. 
Every reasonable wish of our hearts was granted, 
with a pleasure, in pleasing us, which made the 
sweetest part of the benefaction. His pride in his 
sons was good to see. When my younger brother 
proved himself a good sailor and won races, sailing 
his own boat, my father took the liveliest delight in 
his victories, throwing himself into the sport with 
the ardor of a boy. Later, the success of my elder 
brother, as president of the American Bell Tele 
phone Company, was a source of great gratification ; 
largely because, as he said to me, it showed that he 
had real ability, and " was not spoiled by his too 
easy surroundings." In after years his grandchil 
dren became a great delight to him. He dwelt 
much on the pleasure they gave him, and showed as 
large a generosity to them, and sympathy with their 
joys and sorrows, as he had shown in the case of 
his own children. These, both sons and daughters, 
he had made independent of him, in money matters, 
giving so simply and so much as a matter of 



12 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

course that they scarcely realized how unusual such 
liberality was. 

This habit of making light of what he did for 
others was a very strong one. " Mr. Forbes retires 
behind his benefactions," one friend said of him; 
and another, a young relative whom he greatly 
valued and to whom he had given a house, told me, 
" He handed me the deed as if it had been a ticket 
to the opera." This recalls to me a transaction 
which illustrates my father s ingenuity in devis 
ing means of making gifts so that no feeling of 
delicacy on the part of the recipient should be 
wounded. A near relative (Miss E.) and he had 
a mutual friend, one of the rare souls that come to 
bless the earth from time to time and show how 
like heaven some people can make it. This lady 
(Mrs. M.) was a widow with children, whose hus 
band had left her but poorly off, so far as money 
went. With that quiet dignity which graced our 
old-time ladies of New England she had put gently 
aside all offers of help. The house she rented 
chanced to belong to my father, and he well knew 
that he could give her nothing. Miss E. was ill, 
dying, in fact, as both of them knew ; he went to 
her and talked over with her the matter of the 
house, and they agreed that he should deed it and 
its land to her, and that she should leave it to Mrs. 
M. ; and this was done, so that no feeling but that 
of the dear memory of her friend was ever mingled 
in the mind of the recipient with the gift of her 
home. She may have suspected the transaction, 
but in this world she never knew. 



INTRODUCTION 13 

In smaller matters, his inability to enjoy the 
pleasant things of life without sharing them with 
others was a marked trait. No sail in the yacht 
was perfect unless a party could be gathered to 
enjoy it too ; and after the Wild Duck, with her 
auxiliary screw, had taken the place of his old sail 
ing yacht, the Azalea, and had made it possible 
to time his excursions more exactly, he took great 
pleasure in giving the clerks and other employees 
of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Eailroad 
an outing on Boston Harbor or Buzzard s Bay, 
in the latter case sending the yacht to meet them 
in New Bedford, landing them at Naushon, and 
taking them over the island. Then again, once a 
year the Wild Duck, well provisioned you may be 
sure, was lent to the Old Colony Kailroad officials 
who served on the Wood s Hole branch, for a day s 
sail. And the island friends, farmers, sailors, ser 
vants, and all, had one afternoon in the course of 
the summer, with supper served them on the yacht. 

This trait appeared occasionally in a " pious 
fraud" in which he took great satisfaction. He 
much enjoyed fruit, especially oranges ; and at one 
time he owned an orange grove in Florida. It 
proved to be rather a poor one and was soon sold ; 
but it served long as a pretext for the distribution 
of numberless boxes of Indian Kiver oranges (some 
times shipped for him direct from Florida, some 
times secured in Boston) among dozens of friends 
and relatives, from his " Florida grove." 

Never was a man more truly " born in givey wea-

ther," as the little girl in the story of " Poor Papa " 
called it. His last act of this sort, within a few 
weeks of his death, concerned a relative, for whom 
he had a great regard ; but in talking over the pro 
spective gift he was troubled by the thought of her 

virtues, and exclaimed, " M is so unselfish, she 

will give it all away." I comforted him with the 

assurance that M would do as he wished, for 

his sake; and then he took great pleasure in the 
thought that in future she would have a few more 
small comforts on her own account, and wound up 
with, " Her mother and grandmother were so good 
to me." 

Our kind friend of many years, Professor Thayer, 
has spoken, in an article on my father in the " Bos 
ton Transcript," of his " sleepless benevolence." The 
Institute of Technology, schools for the freedmen, 
the Tuskegee School, the Hampton School, Milton 
Academy, funds for the families of various public 
men after their service was ended, and political 
campaign funds, were conspicuous objects of his 
generosity; but there were endless others, both 
public and private, of which we had at the time no 
knowledge. He always said that he wished to see 
money used while he lived ; that he had seen too 
much mischief done by dull trustees to wish to tie 
up money in that way. 1 

1 One of the codicils of his will reads : " I wish my heirs to 
understand that my policy has been, and I hope may continue to he, 
to do what I reasonably can for public objects, and for my near rela 
tives and friends, while I am here and can myself observe the effect 
of what I do. I hope and believe that my heirs will continue the

With all this, he disliked to see his name in pub- 
He donations, and seldom headed a subscription list 
unless he hoped to induce others to give by giving 
himself ; as a rule he concealed the amount of his 
benefaction and let other people lead. Sometimes 
he would put his name and subscription on one line ; 
and on the next " From a friend/ with a second 
donation ; and in some instances, when he took 
especial interest in the matter in hand, he would 
make this ruse cover several of these "friends," 
with a good amount attached to each. 

But in spite of this concealment, it was natural 
that his habit of free giving, when there was any 
good reason for it, should have got abroad and led 
to scores of applications for aid, with no reason to 
show for them whatever. I will give two of these, 
as specimens, the one of innocence, the other of 
assurance. An old woman, well to do in appearance, 
whose name he had never heard before, called on 
him one day at his office and told him she had a 
grown-up son living with her, and it would be so 
nice for them to have a little home of their own. 
She did not want to have any mortgage on it, but 
to own it outright. She had heard that Mr. Forbes 
had more money than he knew what to do with ; 
and now would he manage this for her ? He hated 
to snub her, and said, very gravely, " Madam, I 11 

same policy, within prudent limits, in the way of using their pro 
perty for public and private beneficences under their own eyes ; my 
own experience having been that money can be much better used 
under the eye of the giver, than by bequeathing it, under attempted 
limitations, to public managers or to trustees management." 



16 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

think of it ; " but when she replied, looking at him 
doubtfully, " I m afraid you won t do it/ he had 
to add, " I m afraid I shan t." The other applica 
tion was made by letter. It came from the fond 
mother of twins who had heard that his name was 
John Malcolm, and modestly offered, if he would 
send her $500, to name one of them John Malcolm 
and the other Malcolm John ! 

The Institute of Technology, on the board of 
which he served, always commanded his greatest 
respect and interest. He declared that the classics 
were of no use to half the community ; while, in a 
new country, there must always be a call for tech 
nical training; and he held that a young man 
should be fitted to earn his own living at once on 
leaving his place of instruction. Then, again, Har 
vard, in his opinion, was a club for the favored few, 
not meant for those with whom he most sympa 
thized, whose call was instant work on graduation ; 
and although some of us used to urge that he 
underestimated the scope of Harvard and the good 
to be got there, no argument moved him, and he 
clung to his view of the respective merits of the two 
places of education with his usual tenacity. 

From the year 1857 my father s long vacations 
were spent at Naushon, an island dividing Buzzard s 
Bay from Vineyard Sound, which he had some time 
before joined my mother s uncle, " Governor " 
Swain, in buying. It is about seven miles long, 
with a surface varied by woods, hills, open downs, 

1 The governorship was that of Naushon, ED. 



INTRODUCTION 17 

and a number of ponds, some hidden in the 
depths of tangled swamps, some along the shore or 
in little nooks in the hills, while Deerwood Lake, 
at the west or farthest end, is really a large sheet 
of water, and has always been the principal objec 
tive point for island picnics. 

The same earnestness which filled my father s 
business life went with him when he left the office 
behind. Into play as into work, he threw himself 
with his whole soul ; and it was this, and his abso 
lute faith in the good-will of those about him, 
which inspired children, friends, and dependents 
with the strongest desire to do his bidding, and se 
cured for him such service as is very rare. At the 
word of command men would rush to saddle horses, 
maids to prepare all sorts of unexpected meals, 
boatmen to get yachts ready and hoist sail ; and the 
same inspiration reached to clerks, railway conduc 
tors, telegraph operators, and others with whom he 
came in contact ; all sprang to do his bidding. 

At Naushon my father usually wrote in the morn 
ing ; and when, as he said, he had " cleared the 
decks " of his business letters, he drove with some 
of us to the South Shore of the island, where there 
were bathing-houses and a safe sandy beach, and 
where he taught us to swim. After early dinner, 
and then a short nap, came his afternoon ride, some 
times with the elders, who could go fast, sometimes 
taking me on Johnny Crapaud, the French pony, of 
whom more will be told later on. When I outgrew 
Johnny, there were two island ponies, Countess and 



18 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Kosabelle, to mount ; and often, after a chapter of 
his favorite Sir Walter Scott, he took me with him 
through the woods and over the hills. 

In our talks during these rides there came, natu 
rally and without premeditation, opinions and pre 
cepts which I recall vividly to this day. He spoke 
of the civil war, then raging, and talked with much 
freedom of public men. President Lincoln, he 
always declared, was a follower, not a leader, of 
public opinion ; but of Governor Andrew, whom 
during those anxious years he managed to bring 
once and again to the island for rest, he could not 
say enough in praise. There were talks on busi 
ness matters, of which he held that girls were kept 
much too ignorant, adding that not one in a dozen 
knew, when grown up, the difference between stocks 
and bonds. He spoke of railroads, their policy and 
management, the difficulties of the " long and short 
haul" question, and the like. Business axioms 
were impressed, by the force of his opinion, on my 
mind. Never, he would say, for any business or 
other purpose, borrow more money than, by giving 
up all your property, you can repay, in case your 
venture should be a failure. He said that at one 
time he had to mortgage both his Milton and Nau- 
shon places in order to advance money to the rail 
roads in which he was interested ; but neither then, 
nor at any other time, would any one but himself 
have been a loser had his ventures failed. 

He talked of the importance of always distinctly 
putting responsibility where it belonged. Apropos 



INTRODUCTION 19 

of this, I find a letter of his to a partner in Eussell 
& Co. in which he says : " I have a great horror 
of a divided responsibility, preferring one common 
man, who has got to take all the credit or blame, 
to half a dozen geniuses, who can put it off on 
somebody else." I am inclined to think that his 
adherence to this maxim was an important element 
in his successful leadership. 

There were discourses on the extreme care re 
quired in the treatment of trust funds placed in 
your hands, and the scrupulous avoidance by a busi 
ness man of recommending as an investment for 
others any business in which he might be himself 
engaged, as one could not fail to be more or less 
biased in favor of his own projects. "Let investors 
judge by reports, by character, by the opinion of 
other good business men not in the venture; but 
withhold your own opinion." He was equally em 
phatic in his warning against the assumption that 
high interest on an investment could be either 
secure or permanent, and recommended as a pre 
cautionary measure the saving of anything over 
four per cent, interest on one s capital, for rein 
vestment, in order to be secure against risk and 
depreciation. A conservative business man, he 
said, should never invest in any property which has 
not real, intrinsic value. Nothing is more foolish 
than fancying yourself clever enough to speculate 
successfully in stocks that are for the moment " fa 
vorites," but not good for permanent investment. 
You are pitting your wits against those of men " on 



20 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

change/ the keenest in the country, and are sure 
to fail in the end, as any other amateur gambler 
must do when playing with professionals. On the 
other hand, if a thing has real bottom buy it. 
Then, if it should fall ever so low, you can wait 
patiently for its rise, which will surely come, inde 
pendently of stock market fluctuations ; and when 
it does come, if you wish to sell, do not wait for 
what people consider the highest point, but be con 
tent with a moderate profit. These things point to 
that conservatism in business of which my father 
claimed to have no small share. 

He had a vivid recollection of his own early work 
and struggles, and the strongest wish to help on 
young men who were having a hard time at their 
start in life. He would plan education, and pro 
vide places for boys ; and cared more for those who 
were poor (if only they had energy and determina 
tion to work) than for those whose circumstances 
were easier. He enjoyed having such fellows at 
Naushon and giving them all the fun he could be 
tween their working times. 

As to Naushon, my parents always felt that this 
" Paradise for children young and old " must be 
shared with all their cousins and friends, and their 
respective small people, and I may say, in passing, 
that in war time it became a convalescent hospital. 
A constant stream of guests poured through the 
house and took part in the joyous summer and au 
tumn holiday time, and its boating, riding, fishing, 
and hunting. There was always room for one 



INTRODUCTION 21 

more, and the food was abundant and very simple. 
My father, with keen pleasure in the young folks 
about him, would sit at the long table, chaffing and 
teasing this one and that, or making game of any 
small mischance, such as the getting brushed off 
one s horse by some one not on the lookout for 
projecting boughs ; and he would tell how this 
thing had happened, years before, to Miss Elizabeth 
Peabody of kindergarten fame, and how, on being 
asked whether she did not see the bough, she had 
replied, " Oh, yes, I saw it, but did not realize it ! " 
All this in the kindliest spirit ; and though some 
of the juniors were too shy to appreciate jokes at 
their own expense, the greater part gave as good 
as they got ; and so the meals were very merry, 
pervaded with a sense of vivid life, of which all felt 
my father to be the centre. At times, interspersed 
with the chaff, came really good talk, when some of 
my parents friends, for whose opinion they cared, 
were there. It was their wish that we should be 
listeners on such occasions, and the discussions 
which then took place have left many and delight 
ful memories. 

But the house was generally in the hands of the 
young people ; and with such an army of them as 
I have indicated, the hurly-burly which occurred 
when an expedition to the West End was on foot 
was prodigious. My father would be writing for 
dear life at his table, while the punctual member of 
the family, book in hand, would wait, seated at one 
of the windows, and a concourse of boys and girls 



22 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

would tear through the rooms shouting for bait, 
hooks and lines, luncheon, and billhooks, or for 
choice of which should ride and which go in the 
wagons, he continuing to write as rapidly as if 
perfect calm prevailed. But when once he was 
ready, double-quick was the order, and we were 
soon off and away. He used to go through the 
woods with the most murderous, curved, cutting 
knife, bare in his hand, lopping off such branches 
as grew too much over the road, stopping from 
time to time and dropping his reins on his horse s 
neck, when a tougher bough than could be managed 
with one hand was encountered. As a rule, his 
horses learned to stand this manoeuvre very well; 
I ought to say, however, that on one occasion his 
horse did take offense at a large bough falling on 
his haunches, and dashed off among the trees with 
his rider ; he, seeing a dangerous branch ahead, 
promptly kicked his feet out of the stirrups, dropped 
reins and billhook, caught the branch, and reached 
the ground unhurt. He impressed all the active 
young men into the service, and thus kept the 
paths well open, and insured their having an appe 
tite for the lunch which was afterwards served 
under a great oak near the West End Pond. After 
lunch there was generally a fishing expedition for 
perch, and in later years for black bass, in a flat- 
bottomed boat on the lake. Then home, sometimes 
in the dark, when the horses were the best guides, 
and always brought us back safe and sound. 

Next, in my Naushon holiday memories, comes the 



INTRODUCTION 23 

autumn deer hunt. The precedents for this were 
handed down, somewhat modified in form, from the 
time when my mother s uncle was governor of the 
island. Matters went somewhat thus : breakfast, 
amid considerable confusion over orders for horses, 
arrangements for luncheon, guns, cartridges, etc. 
Next my father with a small hunting horn, very 
eager-eyed, hurrying on the juniors, and, it must 
be confessed, hustling those of the seniors who 
required it, giving prompt orders, in a rather low- 
pitched voice : " Tie up at the black gate ! W., 
put H. on this stand, A. on that ! " and the like. 
Then the piling into the wagons of the elder hunt 
ers, the younger going with my father ; and perhaps 
a couple of girls following on horseback. Then our 
leader sounds one sharp note on his horn : " I give 
you just fifteen minutes to be on your stands," and 
the cavalcade starts off pell-mell for the black gate. 
Here the horses are tied ; and then the hunters are 
hurried by my brothers to certain trees, rocks, or 
shrubs, all out of shot of one another and identified 
by name as separate stands, and are bidden, if raw 
hands, not to stir from their places lest they get 
within some one else s range, never to shoot a doe 
or fawn, nor move until the leader of the beaters 
winds his horn and Mr. Forbes answers with his ; 
this being the signal that the " drive is up," and 
that all have to repair again to the black gate. 
Promptly every man is on his stand, and we can 
hear the drivers shout and the dogs bark, as they 
come through the woods and swamps towards the 



24 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

hunters. The deer are supposed to run in front of 
the drivers, but the older and wiser ones, trained by 
long experience, crouch in the thick undergrowth 
and run back when the men have passed. How 
ever, there are always some unwary enough to run 
forward, and the drivers shout out, " Big buck to 
the right!" or, "Buck to the left!" as the case 
may be, and every one grows much excited. Some 
times there is a shot ; but quite as often as not the 
deer makes off out of range, and no tangible result 
comes out of the great expectations stirred up in 
the hunters. When the drivers come in sight of 
the stands, the horn is sounded and responded to 
by my father, who comes up, eagerly asking what 
has been seen ; and if a deer has been wounded, 
he sets men and dogs on its track. If nothing has 
been done, he decides at once on the next drive, 
hurries every one into his wagon or on to his horse 
with an energy that defies dawdling, and so off 
through the gay autumn woods again as fast as 
horse and man can go. At noon comes a halt and 
lunch under some big oak, my father in the midst, 
stirring up every one to undo packages of sand 
wiches and open ginger-ale bottles, with an aside 
to A. : " There is more than we can manage ; see 
that the extra sandwiches are handed over to the 
men ; they have their own lunch, but these won t 
hurt them ; they have the work to do." After 
luncheon the hunt is resumed until dusk, my father 
never allowing it to continue after that, lest a deer 
should be wounded and the men not able to track it 



INTRODUCTION 25 

and put an end to its pain. Back to the mansion 
house, the cold of the October evening nipping 
one s fingers and making the blazing wood fires in 
all the rooms most welcome. Then dinner at the 
long hunt table, with plenty of fun and the food 
seasoned with the appetite of an open-air day. 
After dinner my father, who never smoked, would 
call for a song and sit listening and marking time 
with his hand in the air, and vehemently applaud 
ing " Come brave the seas with me, love ! " or some 
favorite war song. And so, with a game of cards 
thrown in, would pass the evening. The hunts 
usually lasted two days and a half, and at first my 
father used to ask to it all Governor Swain s old 
friends. As these began to fail him, my brothers 
friends, and business or political allies of his own, 
took their places ; but whoever the guests, there 
was always an atmosphere of outdoor freshness and 
cheer, even in the house, which both parents knew 
well how to give. 

During the autumn months, we usually had one 
or more severe gales, followed the next day by a 
nor wester, with a clear sky and a strong cold 
breeze, which covered the bay with white caps. 
Such a morning was sure to provoke this speech : 
" There must be black duck blown into the North 
Shore ponds by this time. Who wants a try after 
them with me?" Candidates were seldom want 
ing ; but oh, how cold it could be ! We would 
drive in an open wagon in the teeth of the wind to 
the north shore, and there my father would draw 



26 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

up his horse and lay his finger impressively on his 
lips to insure silence, for the black duck were 
keen of sight and hearing, and very shy. Then he 
would get out of the vehicle, seize his gun, and 
creep over the hills, a single opera-glass in hand, 
and coming in sight of a pond would peer anxiously 
into it. If there were no duck, his charioteer was 
signaled to come on by a wave of the arm ; but if 
there were duck, a gesture followed which was 
meant to keep you back, but was sometimes so like 
the other as to be mistaken for it. You soon dis 
covered your error if you advanced, by the vehe 
ment gestures of his hand, this time toward the 
ground, and signifying absolute quiet. As a rule 
the ducks managed to see us and take themselves 
off just as he was ready to fire. But occasionally 
we had the glory of fetching one or two of them 
home. Once, on a cold, gray, autumn day, having 
left me in the woods near the West End Pond, he 
managed to wound a duck badly; and, not being 
able to stand seeing the poor creature flapping 
about on the pond, he stripped and swam to it, re- 
clothed himself in the bitter wind, and came back 
to the wagon with his game, triumphant, but rather 
blue from the bleak bath ! 

It was always a source of gratitude to my father 
that none of his children or guests ever had any 
serious accident at Naushon. In spite of numerous 
hair-breadth escapes on his own part, he always de 
clared that he was at bottom a very prudent man. 
I think that he was. Good riders were . chosen for 



INTRODUCTION 27 

lively horses ; we were commanded never to canter 
downhill ; never to carry guns at full cock ; never 
to lash the main sheet when sailing ; and it was a 
frequent injunction, when any expedition was start 
ing, to " be on the safe side." 

These holiday times at Naushon, strenuous and 
over-active as they sometimes appeared to more pla 
cid natures, were always his chief points of rest. 
From them he set forth again to mercantile, rail 
road, and public work of all sorts, thoroughly re 
freshed. 

I have scarcely touched on the romantic side of 
my father s nature. This appeared most strongly 
in his intense love of the sea. Whether it was due 
to his early voyages, or to his brother s profes 
sion, certain it is that " blue water " much attracted 
him ; all ships were deeply interesting to him, and 
dashing through the waves on ship or yacht in a 
" wholesail breeze " made his spirits rise like a 
boy s. 1 This showed itself also in his regard for Sir 
Walter Scott s novels and poems, which had been 
the delight of his youth. There seemed to be, so 
to speak, an atmosphere of Scott about the place. 
Horses were named Ivanhoe, Kedgauntlet, Douglas, 

1 In a letter to his mother, written while at sea, October 10, 
1830, he says : " What can be more magnificent, for instance, than 
a strong gale (right astern, mind) of a clear winter s day the ship 
springing forward under reefed topsails, and nothing to be seen 
around but the white foamy tops of the waves. There is nothing 
that elevates the spirits so much as this ; it is like riding a fiery 
horse ; he goes at his own speed, but he carries you where you 
guide." 



28 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Bruce, Eob Roy, and Mosstrooper ; we children had 
Scott read to us from seven years old onward ; and 
I can remember his coming frequently to my bed 
side, and half reciting, half chanting, the ballads, 
until I grew too sleepy to listen. 

In 1884, at our parents golden wedding, we 
took advantage of this passion for Scott to celebrate 
it with the performance by his grandchildren, and 
great nephews and nieces, of scenes from " The 
Lady of the Lake," arranged by our friend, Dr. 
Edward Emerson. And again, in 1894, on the 
celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the wed 
ding day, " The Legend of Montrose," dramatized 
by his grandchildren Edith and Cameron Forbes, 
was performed, chiefly by some of the same com 
pany, grown from boys and girls into young men 
and women. Dugald Dalgetty had always been a 
great source of amusement to him. He was glad 
to see this old friend on the stage, and when his 
favorite songs, " Bonnie Dundee," " All the blue 
bonnets are over the border," and " The MacGre- 
gor s Gathering " were given, nothing was left to 
be desired. To these and other Scotch songs, some 
vivid and romantic chord in him always responded ; 
and while they were being sung he often found it 
hard to keep back his tears. He much objected to 
have this noticed, and would cover his forehead with 
his hand, under pretense of listening intently, while 
with his thumb he would surreptitiously wipe away 
the unwelcome tear. 

For Burns, also, he had a sincere affection, and a 



INTRODUCTION 29 

weakness for divers minor poets. His " Old Scrap- 
Book," * which he printed and distributed among 
his friends who came to the golden wedding, in 

1 I give the introduction as eminently characteristic of its 
writer : 

This volume is built up from the nucleus of an old scrap-book 
begun about 1830, and from a few old verses which had been either 
copied or impressed upon the memory much earlier. The original 
leaves still hold a few flowers, pressed fifty years ago, and a good 
many newspaper cuttings of various periods. To these last have 
been added contributions from friends, both in print and manuscript, 
many songs and gleanings from the then current literature of Eng 
land and America, while some living authors, and the representatives 
of others, have generously permitted the free use of their treasures. 

If I were to catalogue in a rough way the patchwork now printed, 
it would read something thus : 

Nu-rsery hymns, having the tones of voices long silent, still ringing 
in one s ears with the distinctness of yesterday. 

Stealings, from school and other books, accumulated in the desul 
tory reading of a lifetime ; and, especially, large extracts from those 
poets who were universally recognized fifty years ago, and whom it 
seems to be the fashion of young America to forget or ignore. 

Songs of the hunt, the yacht, the Indiaman s cabin or deck 
through trade- winds and Cape of Good Hope storms, or the coming 
typhoon, some having for an accompaniment the rushing tide of 
Wood s Holl, or the squall hurrying down the sides of St. Michael s 
or Teneriffe s mountains ; the ripple of the Miami River pushing 
out of the Everglades, the foam along the Florida reefs, or the 
" burr " of the hurricane among the pines of the St. John s River. 

Songs of the concert-room, theatre, and opera, from the days of 
Mario and Grisi, Jenny Lind and Rachel (if the snake-like hissing 
of Rachel s "Marseillaise" can be called singing), down to the 
sturdy Badialli with his three encores of " Suoni la Tromba." 

National, political, and war songs, from the days of the Free- 
Soil campaign of 1856, up to those which rang through the camps 
of Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan, carrying the undertone which so 
many of the verses got from the outgoing regiments under Gordon, 
Lee, Williams, Shaw, Lowell, and Hallowell, and from the sadder 
march when they returned with thinned ranks and tattered flags. 



30 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

1884, shows that alongside of the best poems he 
could find room for all sorts of jingle. His liking 
for either seemed to be quite independent of literary 
merit. Old association was decidedly the strongest 
factor in determining his preferences, and during his 
last years songs and poems from this " Old Scrap- 
Book" were among his keenest pleasures. This 
weakness for old associations extended even to his 
clothes. I have often wondered why one person s 
garments, irrespective of fashion, seemed to partake 
of their owner s individuality, while those of another 

In short, to paraphrase Halleck, 

Songs of the peasant and the peer, 
Songs of the bridal and the bier, 
The welcome and farewell. 

Poems of the parlor, beginning under the low ceiling of the old 
Milton House, then through Pearl Street and Pine Bank, reaching 
over to Russell Sturgis s pleasant quarters on the Praya Grande 
of Macao, and onward still to my little ranch of Mt. St. George 
in California, by no means forgetting Naushon and Swan Island. 

Poems heard from the lips of Emerson, Lowell, Poe, Holmes, 
Fanny Kemble, and the beautiful Catherine Sedgwick, afterwards 
Mrs. Heine. 

All these and a thousand more such threads run through the 
memory like echoes from the past, when one tries to string together 
the rhymes which have been floating in the mind through over half 
a century. 

This crude medley of Poem and Song, Epigram and Charade, is 
offered with some hesitation as a token of remembrance to the few 
old friends who still surround me, and to the many younger ones 
who are so rapidly taking our places. 

If it saves some eyes from straining over faded manuscript and 
fine print, or recalls scenes and tones of voice or of music connected 
with its verses, it will have answered the rather vague purpose with 
which it has been so loosely thrown together. 

J. M. F. 



INTRODUCTION 31 

did not appear to be so affected at all. My father s 
soft felt hats, after a few days wear, grew into such 
characteristic shapes that one could swear to their 
identity anywhere. Capes took unmistakable folds, 
and boots almost turned in their toes of their own 
accord, as he did. He was scrupulously dainty 
about underwear, but habitually careless of the 
outer man, and loved his old raiment so dearly that 
one had almost to use force to get possession of 
it with a view to its transmission. On one occa 
sion, when he seemed to be gaining flesh, a relative, 
who was aware of his peculiarity, declared that it 
was "an effort of nature to get rid of his old 
clothes." 

He did not care for reading of a ponderous kind, 
saying that his " brain wanted rest." Travels, nov 
els of adventure, the Indian mutiny, and all such 
contemporaneous history appealed to him; but he 
used to say that his medieval history he got from 
Shakspere and Scott. Modern fiction of the intro 
spective type he simply ignored, or, if he tried it, 
would put it down, declaring it to be "tedious." 
Of plays he must have been very fond, for he never 
tired of rehearsing Charles Kemble s excellences, 
but his hearing was just enough impaired, even in 
my childhood, to spoil for him this sort of enjoy 
ment. Fanny Kemble s readings, too, he had very 
much admired. He cared for these more than her 
acting, and went to hear them whenever he could. 
I recollect his telling me how her rendering of the 
witches in " Macbeth " made his eyebrows stand on 



32 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

end, a fact of which he was unconscious until he felt 
them pushing against his theatre glasses ! He had 
a warm personal feeling for Mrs. Kemble, and their 
friendship lasted until her death. 

Music, save and except his favorite songs, bal 
lads, and hymns, was a blank to him, and, though 
he liked many operas of the old school, he never 
went to instrumental concerts in my time. He suf 
fered pretty poor singing sometimes at home, so 
long as no one sang a shrill, high note, and all 
confined themselves to his " particular vanities " as 
he called them. These he always greeted with im 
mense enthusiasm, and our friend Miss Emma "Ware, 
who survived him only a few days, used, as long as 
she was able, to come and play old song after old 
song to him, giving him a pleasure beyond words. 
Military bands excited and inspired him, and his 
musical preferences were, like those of Queen Eliza 
beth, " for stormy or lively " airs. 

My father used to like pictures ; and could never 
look enough at those of his friend, Mr. William 
Hunt ; but in other cases the liking was largely for 
the artist s sake ; and he often valued what seemed 
to others to be a fearful daub, if only it repre 
sented a scene he knew, or was painted by some one 
whom he liked and wished to help. Grand natural 
scenery, however, at all times delighted him, and 
gave him one of the greatest pleasures of his many 
journeys. 

I suspect that his architectural ideas were very 
similar to his musical ones so far as the aesthetic 



INTRODUCTION 33 

sense went. In any building which he personally 
used he wanted room, warmth, and convenience ; 
he did not like showy coloring, inside or out ; but 
there ended his interest. I recollect, however, that 
he greatly enjoyed some old halls and castles in 
England. Time had never served for any early 
artistic training, neither do I think that his natural 
tastes lay at all in these directions. 

I ought not, however, to forget among the arts one 
which my father did most heartily enjoy, namely, 
that of oratory. Daniel Webster s Seventh of March 
speech was well-nigh condoned for the sake of 
many another, which for both manner and matter 
had led my father captive. Wendell Phillips, too, 
was almost forgiven for his abuse of Andrew and 
his love of General Butler and the greenback party, 
for the sake of his wonderful power as an orator. 
George William Curtis was one whom my father 
enjoyed hearing speak, especially when, at the 
Convention of 1876 in Cincinnati, he appeared 
contrasted with General Logan. He faithfully at 
tended Mr. Emerson s lectures, much admiring his 
grave, clear enunciation. Mr. Everett he cared less 
for; though, as he used to say, "he could speak 
smoothly." Perhaps he felt his own deficiency in 
these directions ; and hence the more admired in 
others what he himself lacked. Be that as it may, 
I have seldom seen him stirred to more enthusiasm 
than when speaking of the occasions on which he 
had listened to some of these great men. 

I should not forget to mention another source of 



34 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

pleasure, namely, the society of the men composing 
the Saturday Club. This was a club whose mem 
bers met in Boston, on the last Saturday of the 
month, during the greater part of the year, to dine 
together at the Parker House. So much has been 
told of those delightful gatherings in the biogra 
phies of some of the members as to relieve me from 
saying anything about them, except that my father 
regarded them as among the greatest pleasures of 
his life, bringing, as they did, meetings with 
Emerson, Lowell, Longfellow, Holmes, Agassiz, 
Wyman, Judge Hoar, and others whose names are 
household words, not merely in Boston, but through 
out the country. Besides all else, as each member 
could bring one guest, he had the opportunity of 
introducing any distinguished visitor to the best 
wits that were to be found in our good old town. 
At home we used to enjoy these occasions vicari 
ously ; and he would bring home to us the latest 
bit of literary, political, or scientific gossip, or the 
last bon mot of Judge Hoar or Dr. Holmes. It 
was this most genial of poets who wrote the verses 
given below, for the Saturday that fell next after 
my father s eightieth birthday, when they dined 
together at the club. I can only hope their kind 
author took as much pleasure in writing as his 
friend did in hearing them : 



INTRODUCTION ] 30 

TO J. M. F. ON HIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY. 
February 23, 1813 February 23, 1893. 

I know thee well. From olden time 
Thou hadst a weakness for a rhyme, 
And wilt with gracious smile excuse 
The languor of a laggard muse, 
Whose gait betrays in every line 
The weight of years outnumbering thine. 
And who will care for blame or praise, 
When love each syllable betrays ? 

The seven-barred gate has long been past, 
The eighth tall decade cleared at last ; 
But when its topmost bar is crossed 
Think not that life its charm hath lost : 
Ginger will still be hot in mouth, 
And winter winds blow sometimes south, 
And youth might almost long to take 
A slice of fourscore s frosted cake. 

Thrice welcome to the chosen band, 
Culled from the crowd by Nature s hand : 
No warmer heart for us shall beat, 
No freer hand in friendship meet. 
Long may he breathe our mortal air, 
For heaven has souls enough to spare. 
Lay at his feet the fairest flowers 
Thank God he still is earth s and ours. 

One subject remains for me to touch upon, and 
this but lightly, as is due to one of his reserve with 
regard to all matters on which he felt deeply. He 
used to say that the Unitarian Church was the one 
most liberal, and therefore likely to go forward, 



36 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

that he knew, and he always contributed liberally 
to the support of that church in Milton. When I 
was a child he always went to hear " Brother Put 
nam/ as he called his friend, Dr. George Putnam, 
the distinguished minister in Roxbury. He also 
much admired Theodore Parker, while for Mr. 
Emerson his reverence was very deep. Later on he 
seemed not to care much about churches, saying, 
" We all know very little." Once he said to me 
that " universal law presupposes a law-giver," and 
that " somehow we must believe in thought behind 
matter." But in general he spoke seldom on such 
subjects. His creed might be said to be Laborare 
est or are. VN&gt;&lt; k v 



CHAPTER II 

SCHOOL DAYS 

THE notes of which the present and succeeding 
chapters largely consist were written by my father 
in 1884 ; and had slight additions made to them by 
him in 1889. To explain their opening it should 
be said that my grandfather, Ralph Bennet Forbes, 
detained in France on business, was joined by his 
wife in 1811, and that after some troublesome ad 
ventures, all of which may be found in my uncle s 
book, 1 they found themselves at the beginning of 
1813 in Bordeaux. It is to her voyage out that 
the following extract from a letter dated " Boston, 
March 23, 1812," refers. 

WILLIAM STURGIS TO JOHN P. GUSHING. 

. . . Most truly do I join in your wishes for 
the success of our friend Forbes ; he is a most in 
defatigable fellow, and she a most extraordinary 
woman. She went from hence in January, 1811, in 
a little schooner laden with fish ; and after encoun 
tering every species of distress and danger was 
finally landed, from a British frigate that captured

ton, Little, Brown & Co., 1882. 



38 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

her, on a small island near the coast of France, and 
reached her husband. 



Here follow my father s own notes, necessarily 
much abridged : 

" They tell me I was born at Bordeaux, in France, 
on the 23d of February, 1813, and this is con 
firmed by a certificate ( de naissance from some 
officer of Napoleon the Great; while color is also 
given to the tale by my early recollections of being 
called Johnny Crapaud. As, however, my parents 
were merely travelers in France, I am assured that 
my title to citizenship is as good as anybody s. 

"On our way home, when I was three months 
old, on the schooner Orders in Council, we were 
attacked by one or more Guernsey privateers, whom 
we repulsed after a spirited fight : an early experi 
ence in naval warfare which gave me the advantage 
in after life, when discussing such matters, of one 
speaking with authority, and on one occasion I 
used it very effectively. In 1861 a certain Mr. 
Smith, M. P., brought me letters of introduction, 
and at dinner he positively denied that England 
had been guilty of the barbarism of fitting out pri 
vateers. This was a very practical question then, as 
the rebels were preparing to send out this class of 
pirates from England. I answered Mr. Smith by 
telling him that I had been myself in action with a 
British privateer, and as I gave no particulars, he 
could only accept my evidence. There is a family 
tradition that on board the Orders in Council the 



SCHOOL DAYS 89 

baby was put down in the forecastle, with a dose of 
laudanum in his stomach and his ears stuffed with 
cotton wool to avoid harm from the noise of the 
cannon. 

" My father had married, early in life, Margaret 
Perkins, the youngest child of one of the most pro 
sperous Boston families. My two uncles, James 
and T. H. Perkins, were among the largest, if 
not the largest, East India merchants in the United 
States, having a branch house in China (then four 
to six months distant in time), which was managed 
by my cousin, J. P. Gushing, and later by my 
brother, Thomas Tunno Forbes. My other uncle, 
Samuel G. Perkins, was engaged in the Calcutta 
trade, when not occupied by his more congenial 
pursuit of gardening. 

" I have heard my father spoken of as a man of 
great energy, and originally of the warmest feelings 
and the most genial and generous temperament, 
somewhat resembling in character my brother Ben- 
net ; but he had been prostrated by overwork at 
about forty-five years of age, after being unsuc 
cessful in his very energetic business life, and as I 
remember him during my early days he was very 
much broken up by gout and a partial paralysis. 
He died in October, 1824, being then about fifty- 
one years old. 

" The visible means of support of my parents, 
with five children at home, was, I remember, $1200 
per annum, contributed by my three Perkins uncles. 
I well recall my mother s patient patching and darn- 



40 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

ing, my sister Emma s vigilant eye to our wants, 
corporeal and spiritual, and especially the latter on 
Sunday afternoons, when she always read to us our 
Bible and hymns. 

"My earliest recollection now (1884) is of the 
little low-roofed house in Milton between the ceme 
tery and the Randolph turnpike, still standing and 
still called the Peggy Howe house, 1 which my 
father had hired. Later comes in the more com 
fortable home, on Milton Hill, given or lent to my 
father by his brother, The Consul/ John Murray 
Forbes, where my childhood and early school days 
were passed. My first school experience was under 
the not severe rod of Miss Polly Crane, who ruled 
with steady hand and literally a very long stick, 
with which she used to reach the whole class without 
leaving her post; and my next school was under 
Master Pierce in the town schoolhouse. 

" It stands recorded by the elder members of the 
family that I was good at my letters and had a 
marked taste for the Bible, which led them fondly 
to predict the church as my vocation and to give me 
the agreeable name of The Bishop/ which I much 
preferred to the older one, hinting at my foreign 
birthplace. I ought to add, however, that the pos 
sibility of such a fate was averted in my case by 
the forcing of the Bible upon me in early life, in 
season and out of season, so that it became to me 
even as salts and senna in the mouth. I hope that 
my descendants may be treated with more discre-

tion and that it may become food to them instead 
of physic. 

" Among our pleasures I remember the drives, 
when I first learned to hold the reins, squeezed in 
between my father and mother, the vehicle being 
old Jerry Crane s yellow two-wheeled chaise with no 
top, shabby and henspecked, drawn by his old white 
horse which looked the very image of the pale horse 
in Scripture lore. For a very small payment this 
team was hired occasionally from its daily routine 
of peddling fowls and vegetables, and with great 
enjoyment we drove about the town. 

"This early life of strict economy, with each 
member of the family obliged to make little sacri 
fices for the others, and especially for our sick 
father, was the best training that could have been 
given. My mother so regarded it, and not merely 
from pride, but from forethought and principle, she 
refused the larger aid which her brothers would 
have furnished, and would only accept what seemed 
absolutely necessary. 

" As my brothers Tom and Bennet got up in the 
world, they were able to help, and more comfortable 
housekeeping followed, but never more cheerfulness 
nor more unbounded hospitality than the little old 
house with its narrow limits and narrow means 
always supplied. Where the numbers who came 
there slept, and how they were fed, even on our 
plain fare, the Lord only knows." 

The following letter from my father to his eld 
est brother, Tom, in Canton, is the earliest which 



42 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

has been preserved. It is dated Milton, June, 
1821 : 

" Ben has been with us a week, and is in very 
good health. The Canton Packet ran on shore on 
the southern part of George s Island, but received 
no injury, as she was aground only nine hours. It 
happened on a dark rainy night with a pilot. We 
are all writing to you except sister Peg, who left 
her letter to ride on horseback. I went to Boston 
to spend election. In the morning I went on the 
Common, and called for a glass of lemonade in high 
style, and the consequence was a dizziness in my 
head. I could get to cousin Nancy s without fall 
ing. As I have told you this secret, I should like 
to know whether you ever got tipsy. I received 
your painting by the Volunteer, which delighted us 
all very much, also the walking toys. My adven 
ture 1 sells very well in the village. I shall send 
the money out by Ben if he goes direct. Mary and 
Fanny send their love to you : as for the rest, they 
must speak for themselves. Excuse this bad writ 
ing. Ben says you have a box of paints, which 
would be very acceptable to your humble servant 
and affectionate brother, J. M. F." 

My father s notes continue : 

" The first break in this wholesome, hardy life at 

1 My uncle Tom had a " privilege," as it was called, of space in 
the Perkins vessels, and under it had given J. M. F. a little " adven 
ture " in tea or silk or perhaps Chinese toys. These adventures 
gradually accumulated, until at seventeen, when he went out to 
China in the Lintin, he began his commercial life with above 
$1000 of his own. ED. 



SCHOOL DAYS 43 

Milton was my transfer, when about eight and a 
half years old, to the Franklin Academy in the 
north parish of Andover, kept by Master, or as he 
was called, Preceptor, Putnam. He was, I suppose, 
a good teacher : certainly a sharp disciplinarian. It 
was altogether a rough place. Under a leaning 
roof of not a large room were three large beds, and 
in each not less than two, and sometimes I think 
three, boys of nine to twelve years old; and as 
washing was included in the board bill there was 
some premium or bonus of cake or extra bread and 
butter applied to reward those who wore their shirts 
longest ! 

" In those days wrestling at arm s length was the 
chief game with young and old, and on election 
days and other holidays the young men used to 
collect and try their strength. Andover gave me 
such good training at it that I afterwards held my 
own among bigger boys at Hound Hill, and I never 
lost my skill at it. After my own boys had got to 
be twice as strong and much heavier than I, I have 
often laid Will and Malcolm on their backs at arm s 
length, or elbow and collar grip as it was called at 
Andover." 

The following account, condensed from my fa 
ther s notes, covers the remaining five years of his 
school life : 

"In October, 1823, I was sent to the famous 
school at Bound Hill, Northampton, then lately 
opened by Messrs. Cogswell and Bancroft. The 
grounds covered perhaps a hundred acres, with fine 



44 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

woodland and beautiful views of the Connecticut 
valley and of Mt. Holyoke and Mt. Tom. Mr. 
Cogswell was a learned man and a man of the 
world, and to him was largely due the breadth and 
liberality of the school, and its great success. The 
teaching was of no meagre kind, for Germany, 
Italy, France, and Spain each gave us of its best. 
But it was the pleasant and friendly relations of 
Mr. Cogswell and his masters with the boys, and the 
gymnastic and out-of-door education, which made 
Round Hill peculiar. The boys were taught to 
ride, had skating and swimming in their seasons, 
and wrestling, baseball, and football; and, during 
the summer, excursions on the ride and tie plan, 
of sometimes over a hundred miles and back, were 
undertaken, accompanied by Mr. Cogswell, who was 
himself a great walker. He and some of the boys 
carried hammers, and he would give us a geological 
lecture when we sat down to rest. Under the ex 
cellent rules I am sure no schoolboys ever did less 
mischief to the farmers orchards and fences ; in 
deed, we were warmly welcomed everywhere, and 
the only uncomfortable reminiscence which remains 
is that of some blistered feet and sunburned faces 
from those long summer walks. 

" I must not forget the little town Cronytown 
which we built. In parties of twos and threes 
we burrowed into the side hill, made a low chimney, 
and front door, looking south, with height enough 
to stand erect and a real lock and key. Here many 
rabbits and an occasional partridge, the product of 



SCHOOL DAYS 45 

our traps or our bows, were cooked, and many an ear 
of sweet corn roasted, especially on Saturday after 
noons; and while there was much fun I never knew 
of any harm growing out of the indulgence. If it 
did no other good, it helped to confine us to the 
killing of game which we could eat. Let me not 
forget, however, our once catching a tartar. Visit 
ing one of our steel traps, the foremost boy, hear 
ing a scratching of the ground as we approached, 
jumped boldly forward to secure the prize, when in 
stead of bunny he was met by the pungent salute 
of the black and white American sable, and beat an 
ignominious retreat amid the jeers of his companions. 

" Strange as it may seem to the youngsters who 
have made fun of my misses in later life with the 
gun, I was one of the best archers among the hun 
dred and fifty, and only remember T. G. Appleton 
as a successful competitor. 

" The history of my life at Eound Hill School 
would not be complete if I forgot fisticuffs. I 
think there was no teaching of boxing as an art 
there, and fighting was discountenanced without 
being too rigidly punished, but one encounter I 
remember in which I took a hand, and this was a 
regular duel with two seconds on each side. My 
antagonist was a boy rather bigger than I, but by 
no means so quick as I then was, and after two or 
three bouts I was decided the victor, having closed 
my opponent s eyes, but at the expense of dislocat 
ing both my thumbs, which in my unskillful fash 
ion I had extended too far. Another threatened 



46 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

attack from one of the bullies of the school I once 
stopped with my bat, as he was entirely too strong 
for a fair fight with fists. My notion then as now 
was, after Polonius advice, Avoid getting into a 
fight by all honorable means, but, once in, so con 
duct the war that your adversary would not soon 
hanker after another. From this principle of ac 
tion, as much as anything, I had very few quarrels 
in school or since ; and both theory and practice I 
strongly recommend to my descendants. 

" To sum up the physical results of Round Hill. 
When I left it in 1828 to enter my uncles Boston 
office, I was strong, healthy, and self-reliant, though 
not remarkable in any degree ; a fair swimmer, a 
good shot, and best of all a good rider ; and I never 
can be grateful enough for the advantages which 
Mr. Cogswell conferred." 

I now give a selection from my father s school 
boy letters to different members of his family, to 
gether with extracts from two letters written by Mr. 
Cogswell to my grandmother, when his pupil was 
leaving Bound Hill : 

TO HIS MOTHER. 

NORTHAMPTON, November 2, 1823. 

DEAR MOTHER, I hope to receive my pictures 
and bed-quilt. I mean to write you a long letter, 
therefore you will not have another for a fortnight. 
. . . Last Sunday I fell down and hurt my knee, 
and last Saturday I climbed a large tree and strained 
the cords so that I can hardly walk. I hope that 



SCHOOL DAYS 47 

you will write me a good long letter with the pic 
tures. I find that none of the boys are very good 
climbers, so that I gained the prize for climbing, 
which was a fine crossbow. I now study with Mr. 
Cogswell, which I like very much. We are getting 
to be very fine runners ; we have run half a mile in 
three minutes and a half ; we run twice a day. . . . 
My leg has prevented my going to meeting to-day, 
therefore I can find time to write another letter to 
you. ... If there should be an opportunity for 
China do tell me, that I may write a handsome long 
letter to Tom. If you send me up any cake or 
sweetmeats, depend upon it I will let you have them 
again or I will give them to the boys, as I now want 
only manly things. . . . You must send your let 
ters, which I suppose you have received before this 
time, from Tom and Ben. I continue to feel very 
happy here. I do not think that Mary will write 
me a separate letter now, I don t want her to ; how 
ever, I hope that she will sometimes put into your 
letters a specimen, to see whether she can beat the 
writing in the letter which I sent you by Emma, if 
she dares to try. I hope that little F. goes on bet 
ter than she did when I left home. I hope there is 
some good schoolmistress in Milton, for I am certain 
if they go to Daddy Fairbanks much longer they 
will be spoilt forever. Tell Emma that I think she 
could manage them better than any lady, as she has 
a pretty good head. ... I suppose you will come 
to Northampton in the spring vacation. I hope 
that you will follow the plan I am going to propose, 



48 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

which is that you set out with me about a week 
before the end of the vacation, then I can drive you 
all around. J. M. F. 

TO T. T. FORBES, CANTON, CHINA. 

NORTHAMPTON, January 16, 1825. 

MY DEAR BROTHER, . . . Mr. Cogswell is as 
fine a man as there is to be found ; he is very amia 
ble and pleasant and has much knowledge, not only 
of the languages, but of natural history ; he was a 
lawyer, but disliked it ; he has traveled over almost 
all Europe and part of Asia and Africa; he has 
been as kind to me as possible. ... I am reading 
Cicero s orations, which is pretty hard to me. ... I 
sleep in Mr. Cogswell s house, in which point I think 
I am very lucky, as he is so kind to me. Once one 
or two of us dressed ourselves as quickly as we 
could when we were called, and went down into the 
place where we wash. I having some paper, we got 
some wood in the fireplace, I made a fire, then 
Mr. C. came down to tell us it was school time. 
He asked who made the fire ; we told him we did. 
He then told us we might make one every A. M. 
if wanted, and might keep it there all day. We 
thanked him and told him we would like it. We 
then got all the boys together and got our own 
wood, for there is plenty round in the woods, and 
we take turns every A. M. This may show what kind 
of a man he is. I suppose you know all the news 
better than I do. I am as ignorant as if I were a 
hermit in the Indian forest. , I should like to 



SCHOOL DAYS 49 

ask a favor, though you may think it foolish. It is 
that you would send me some Chinese insects, of 
which I should like to make a present to Mr. 
Hentz. He has a very fine collection of insects and 
seems to prize those he had from China very much. 
He has always been very kind to me. I hope you 
will not put yourself to any trouble about it. 
Your grateful and affectionate brother, 

J. M. F. 

TO THE SAME. 

ROUND HILL, NORTHAMPTON, June 6, 1828. 
. . . You may be sure that I shall receive [your] 
advice and wishes as to my conduct as anything 
rather than those of a taskmaster, and I trust that I 
shall observe them more strictly than if they were 
so. I can hardly say that I was surprised at your 
determination as to my going to Canton. I have 
thought much of it since you left and had almost 
come to the same conclusion myself, and I have 
thought for some time that whether I went into the 
Perkins s store in Boston or not, I must end by 
going to Canton. It is true that it must be painful 
to me to leave all our friends here, but I feel that it 
is better to make any sacrifice than to be a useless 
member of our family. It is true that in a little 
while I might make myself useful in the Perkins s 
store ; but I know from some examples, and perhaps 
from my own little experience, how difficult it is to 
give my attention to anything in a place like Bos 
ton, though I think I could do it. These are my 



50 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

sentiments at present, and were they otherwise, I 
should not hesitate to give up my judgment to 
yours : and I think they will not change. . . . As to 
manners, etc., I have a couple of monitors, mother 
and Emma, who are always ready to add theory to 
practice when I am under their jurisdiction, and are 
always ready to direct and restrain my boyish pro 
pensity to slovenliness, and also to bring me into 
all the society possible while I am with them. The 
former is here now, staying with Mrs. Howe. She 
thinks I had better follow my former plan of going 
into the store in Boston in October, if they will take 
me for one year, that I may see something of the 
world before going to Canton, and perhaps to see 
something of society and to correct any carelessness 
about appearance which I may have contracted dur 
ing my residence under the aristocratical and free- 
thinking government of Kound Hill. I have read 
your letter to Emma, and must own that I almost 
envy you the pleasure of being able to render one 
so dear to us all independent, and hope most sin 
cerely that, if fortune is favorable to me, it may be 
my first pleasure, as it is yours, to share it with those 
I love. My obligations to you can never be repaid, 
but I hope to show you at least by my conduct that 
I am not insensible to them. 1 I shall, as you wish, 

1 This refers to the help that his brother Thomas gave towards 
his education. In a letter dated September 11, 1823, addressed to 
this brother in Canton, he says : " Mother intends paying half my 
expenses at Northampton, and to your goodness I must be in 
debted for the rest; I hope to repay you in part by my diligence and 
good conduct, and to show you on your return that I have been nei- 



SCHOOL DAYS 51 

pay a good deal of attention to my French and 
Spanish. In the former I feel quite secure and 
even prepared to put it into immediate use ; as to 
the latter, I have not nearly so general knowledge 
either in reading, writing, or speaking, either from 
not having so good a teacher or from an idea when 
I began of its not being of so much consequence. 
For this deficiency I shall endeavor to make up in 
the time I have left. . . . 

Your ever affectionate brother, 

J. M. F. 

JOSEPH G. COGSWELL TO MRS. R. B. FORBES, MILTON. 

NORTHAMPTON, July 17, 1828. 

MY DEAR MADAM, I should not doubt for a 
moment of the plan to be pursued with John if Col 
onel Perkins could give him a place in his compting 
room. ... I consider him as possessor of a far bet 
ter education than nine tenths of the young men 
who have received degrees at our colleges, and feel 
no scruples about sending him out on the great 
theatre of life, either as to principles or knowledge. 
In both respects his condition is entirely satisfactory 
to me, and I hope you will have reason to accord 
with me in opinion. ... It is not mere length of- 
time in which he has been my pupil, that attaches 
me strongly to him ; a stronger tie is the uncommon 
worth and irreproachable character he has main 
tained in this relation. . . . 

ther idle nor ungrateful for the high privilege you have afforded me 
on this occasion."

cellent a character as your son." . . . 



CHAPTER III 

FIRST VENTURES 

MY father s Boston counting-house recollections 
refer largely to traits of the sea-captains employed 
by the firm and of others connected with it. These, 
however interesting to those whose recollections 
stretch as far back as the beginning of the century, 
can hardly appeal to more modern readers, and I 
have therefore confined my selections to memories 
of his own life : 

" From Round Hill school I went almost directly 
(October, 1828) to the counting-room of my uncles, 
Messrs. J. and T. H. Perkins, in Boston. My 
brother Tom was either head clerk, or possibly 
junior partner, of the Canton house, under J. P. 
Cushing (our cousin), who had been some twenty- 
five years in China, and was about returning home 
with a fortune. 

"The Boston house was at this time 1828, 
1829 occupying two large stores, Nos. 52 and 54, 
near the end of Central Wharf in Boston, in front 
of which their ships engaged in the China trade 
discharged and received cargoes. 

" As I was the youngest clerk, my duty at first 
consisted largely in sweeping the store, making the 



54 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

fire, closing up at night, and taking home to the 
active partner the large journal or book which 
formed the basis of the house s accounts. This, 
incased in a green baize bag, I used to deposit, with 
the keys of the store, at his house the last thing at 
night, going for them the first thing in the morn 
ing. Later, but I cannot say exactly when, my 
duties were lightened by having an old retainer of 
the firm installed as porter. 

"Mr. Samuel Cabot was the active managing 
partner of the firm and bore the brunt of the work 
at Central Wharf. 

" My immediate superiors were my cousin, J. H. 
Perkins, a year or two my senior, and J. T. Hay- 
ward, the head bookkeeper. They were on the 
whole kind and considerate to the awkward boy 
they were doomed to lead in the ways of mammon, 
admitting me to more of companionship than I had 
any right to expect. 

" It may be heterodox and a bad example, but I 
cannot refrain from recording one sketch which 
still lingers of the three parties last referred to. It 
was customary when discharging our ships to stow 
away in the lofts any wines or liquors which were 
left from their stores, and on very rare occasions 
my seniors used to test the goodness of these rem 
nants from an East India voyage. On one stormy 
afternoon, when the blustering snow seemed to 
insure Mr. Cabot s absence, I had been sent up for 
a bottle of whiskey, the sugar was also always 
saved, and the tin pot used for testing tea was well 



FIRST VENTURES 55 

filled with water and on the office fire, just begin 
ning to warm, when a hurried step on the stairs and 
a stamping of snowy feet outside the office door 
announced Mr. Cabot ! With presence of mind 
worthy of a better cause, James P. seized the blower 
and adroitly hid the teapot, just as his superior 
entered and seated himself at his desk to write one 
of those interminable letters to China which we all 
dreaded. Hayward, on his high stool, worked away 
at his books, while the two junior sinners watched 
with trembling the issue. For minutes, which 
seemed hours, Mr. Cabot worked away at his desk, 
the fire roaring in the chimney and the air getting 
more and more heated, until at last he pushed back 
his chair, exclaiming, What on earth have you got 
such a fire for ; take off that blower ! Jim ran to 
the blower, now red hot, and with the tongs man 
aged to extract it from its place, and to our great 
relief the tin pot, water and all, had disappeared, 
no doubt shriveled up by that fiery blast, and the 
dreaded explanation, or explosion, was no longer to 
be feared. 

" My boarding place was with Mrs. Mellus, first 
in Otis Place, and afterwards in Hamilton Place, 
next the alley which still leads down to Winter 
Street. At Otis Place I now only remember one 
fellow-boarder, the once celebrated beauty of Bos 
ton, Miss Mattie Hatch. She was then a very well 
preserved but somewhat portly lady of about sixty, 
well-mannered, kindly and gracious to all about 
her, but to my young eyes retaining little trace of 



56 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

the beauty or charms which had made her cele 
brated. 

" A boy of sixteen does not see much of society, 
but besides my relatives, the Perkinses and Cabots, 
I remember the welcome I always received at Mr. 
William Sturgis s in Summer Street, and at a few 
other houses. 

" My Sundays, with part of Saturday afternoon, 
always found me at Milton, and as my mother had 
received from my cousin, Mr. Cabot, a present of 
a horse, I think named Charlie Hardscrabble, and 
had set up a carry-all, it was my practice to start at 
a certain hour on foot out over the South Boston 
turnpike, and about half way out to meet my sister 
Emma with the carry-all. In those days Dunmore s 
stage left Milton Mills every morning at about 
eight, returning in the afternoon, and was the only 
public conveyance between Boston and Milton. 
Our letters were often carried back and forth by 
Mr. Beal, the milkman." 

The first of the letters which follow was written 
directly after my father entered the Perkins count 
ing-house. The second could scarcely have been 
read by his brother, as he was drowned off Macao 
only seven weeks after its date : 

J. M. FORBES TO THOMAS T. FORBES. 

MILTON, October 12, 1828. 

DEAR BROTHER, I have at last taken leave of 
Northampton for good. I was sorry of course to 
part with Mr. Cogswell, for his treatment of me has 



FIRST VENTURES 57 

been uniformly kind and friendly. He says he 
thinks me prepared for the duties of an active life, 
and that I should derive more benefit from being in 
the store than from being any longer with him. I 
only want about four months of the age you men 
tioned and hope that you will be satisfied with my 
being in the store till shipped for Canton, to which 
event I look forward as the time at which I should 
commence my duties to you, and perhaps to mother, 
in a more efficient manner than heretofore. Mother 
is trying to procure a boarding place for me in some 
French family ; if she cannot I shall take lessons in 
French and Spanish in the evenings, by Mr. Cogs 
well s recommendation. By his advice I shall also 
read history and travels in my leisure time. En 
passant, a book has been lately translated from the 
French of Malte-Brun styled "Universal Geogra 
phy," in five large volumes. . . . Should you not 
like to have me get it and send it out to you ? I 
have studied the part relating to Hindostan and the 
Oceanica, as he calls all those islands, and think it 
as entertaining as any travels. I have of course 
seen Mr. Cushing and liked him better than I ex 
pected, for you know that we have always looked 
upon him as many degrees higher than the pope in 
all his glory, and I expected to feel a proportionate 
degree of awe in his presence. I think he has the 
faculty of making one feel easy, his manners are so 
calm and unostentatious. . . . Mother looks upon 
him as the only unexceptional object (except per 
haps aunt Abbott) in this wide world of sin. . . . 



58 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

I feel the sooner I go to Canton the sooner I can 
come back, and that perhaps my going may have 
some influence on your return. 

Your ever affectionate brother, 

J. M. F. 

MILTON, May 30, 1829, Sunday. 

MY DEAR BROTHER, I wrote you a short letter 
yesterday in case the Canton Packet should go off 
" & la Franqaise" though it is not probable she will 
go before Tuesday. To-morrow is the " Election " 
day, and I shall stay out of town. It is the first 
holiday I have had since I have been in the store, 
and it seems as if I were going to stay here a week. 
. . . We have not had much pressing business at 
the store this winter, though you know there is 
always employment in making copies of invoices, 
etc. If I should stay another six months, however, 
I shall have much more work. As yet I have had 
but little to do with China cargoes except the Par 
thian, which gave me a pretty good dip into the art 
of stowing teas, as I had the whole management of 
hers. . . . Your part came out in excellent order, a 
few chests of Souchong only being damaged. I 
should think they would sell pretty well from what 
I hear, though if you believe Mr. Cabot, the times 
are so bad that it is better to make a bad than a 
good bargain, from the greater security of getting 
paid. Mr. Cabot talks a great deal about giving 
up trade and winding up the concern. James Per 
kins says he means to wind up the concern as he 



FIRST VENTURES 59 

would a clock, " to make it go the longer." ... I 
make out to keep on the fair-weather side of the 
colonel by always knowing how many brigs and 
ships are coming up, and which way the wind is. 
... I have been expecting by every vessel to hear 
something of your plans in regard to me, but I do 
not now hope to have anything before the Bashaw 
appears. ... If she does not come here I shall 
expect orders to go by first ship direct, which will 
probably be Bryant & Sturgis s new ship, to sail 
by the last of June. If the Bashaw comes, it is said 
she will go off without landing any of her cargo, 
which consummation I hope you will have pre 
vented by partly loading her with goods salable 
here, perhaps half a cargo of cheap teas for Sep 
tember, and some manila grass which I should cal 
culate will go off then. . . The Smith place 1 has, I 
suppose you know, been sold. Mother is much dis 
appointed at Mr. Gushing not getting it, and hopes 
to see it in your hands at some future day. Wish 
ing with all my heart and soul and body that the 
aforesaid hope may be accomplished, . . . the great 
Bashaw prosper, and teas rise in these United States, 
I remain your affectionate brother, 

J. M. FORBES. t 

I now return to my father s recollections of the 
last part of his work in the Boston counting-house, 
and of his start for China : 

1 Now known as the Russell Place, the old estate of Governor 
Hutchinson on Milton Hill. 



60 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

" Some time in February, 1830, the quiet and 
peace of my routine life was sadly interrupted by 
the news of the tragic death of my brother Tom 
in a typhoon near Macao, on the 10th of August, 
1829, over five months previous. I remember car 
rying up the letters to Mr. Cabot s house without 
suspecting their contents. What marked the event 
more conspicuously was, that the night before I had 
been at a very gay party. It was one of the bright 
est evenings of my life, its tints perhaps colored by 
the cloud which so soon followed it. 

" I was too young to know my brother Tom well, 
but everybody who did know him agreed in believ 
ing that in this last great crisis he had sacrificed his 
own safety in the hope of saving his friend, who was 
on his way with him, in a little schooner from Macao 
to Canton, to meet one of Perkins & Co. s ships. 

" Another incident will further indicate his char 
acter. Our father had been unlucky in business 
and failed, owing various parties money. As soon 
as my brother Tom had become prosperous his first 
duty had been to make his mother comfortable. 
His next was the pleasure of looking up his father s 
creditors and repaying, perhaps to all, but certainly 
to those who most needed the money, his father s 
debts, although of course there was not even the 
most remote legal obligation upon him to do so. 

" From the time when we heard of my brother 
Tom s death I was in constant preparation for my 
voyage to China in the Lintin, commanded by my 
brother Bennet, during the coming summer. 



FIRST VENTURES 61 

"My brother Tom s death proved the turning- 
point in the affairs of Perkins & Co., for it left 
them not only without a partner in China, but also 
without any person who had been in training for 
such a position. 1 

" I remember the parting from home, saddened 
by the blow which Tom s death had inflicted on all 
our circle. I fancy that no boy ever left his native 
land with less enthusiasm or love of adventure than 
I did. 

" The Lintin sailed on the 7th of July, 1830, my 
brother taking me as a passenger, and also Au 
gustine Heard, who was engaged to take charge of 
the house of Russell & Co., in Canton. We also 
had with us a young physician, Dr. John Jennison, 
of Northampton, who went out to seek his fortune 
in China, and I think worked his passage as ship s 
surgeon. 

" Our voyage to China was entirely without event. 
We anchored at Lintin about the middle of Novem 
ber, 1830, and went on the same night with our 
letter bag for Canton, seventy miles distant. My 
first impression of China was our passing in the 
dusk the splendid fleet of the English East India 
Company anchored at Whampoa, ten miles below 
Canton, some fifteen or twenty ships of the size and 
appearance of our large frigates, well armed and 

1 I find that Mr. Gushing, who was in Europe at the time, went 
by overland route at once to Canton, to look after the affairs of 
Perkins & Co. there, and merged their business in that of Russell & 
Co. before the arrival in China of my father and my uncle Bennet. 
-ED. 



62 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

manned ; in f act, perfectly able (as they had proved 
themselves) to beat off a powerful French squadron. 

" My boyhood period ended sharply when I ar 
rived in China, and was, by an arrangement made 
by Mr. J. P. Gushing, at once put into the office 
of Eussell & Co. as their youngest clerk, but with 
a private understanding, *not communicated to me 
until I reached China on my return in August, 
1834, that if I proved competent I should be ad 
mitted to the firm on the 1st of January of that 
year. My salary was not large, but my quarters 
and position were good, as my fellow passenger, Mr. 
Heard, became the active manager of Russell & Co., 
and was very kind and indulgent to me. Before 
Mr. Gushing left (about the new year) he intro 
duced me to his old friend Houqua, the chief of the 
Hong, 1 or company, which then managed all the 
foreign trade of China, and recommended me to his 
confidence. 

" Houqua, who never did anything by halves, at 
once took me as Mr. Gushing s successor, and that 
of my brother Tom, who had been his intimate 
friend, and gave me his entire confidence. All his 
foreign letters, some of which were of almost na 
tional importance, were handed me to read, and to 
prepare such answers as he indicated, which, after 
being read to him, were usually signed and sent 

1 A Hong was technically a collection of business offices. The 
Russell & Co. Hong, or the " Swede " Hong, as it was called, 
consisted of five houses, one fronting the square, the rest behind, 
communicating by a sort of street, with verandas looking down. 
ED. 



FIRST VENTURES 63 

without alteration. It was his habit when he could 
not sell his tea or silks at satisfactory prices to 
ship them to Europe or America, and before I was 
eighteen years old it was not uncommon for him 
to order me to charter one or more entire ships at a 
time, and load them. The invoices were made out 
in my name, and the instructions as to sales and 
returns given just as if the shipments were my own 
property, and at one time I had as much as half a 
million dollars thus afloat, bringing me into very 
close correspondence with Baring Bros. & Co., and 
other great houses. 

"Besides doing my work for Houqua, I had 
plenty to occupy me at the office, and as I had 
from various causes the appearance of being much 
older than I really was, I soon found myself play 
ing a man s part. Kussell & Co. s business, swelled 
by that of Perkins & Co., was very large, and Mr. 
Heard, though untiring in his industry, was by no 
means rapid in his methods, so that a great deal 
came upon my shoulders. Old captains and super 
cargoes were often turned over to me for consulta 
tion without any suspicion of my inexperience, and 
as some of them were foreigners my French and 
Spanish lessons proved useful. 

" In these days of steam and telegraph it is dif 
ficult to conceive of the state of isolation in which 
we lived. When a ship arrived she often brought 
news five or six months old from home, but as the 
success of her voyage depended upon keeping pri 
vate all intimations about the market which she had 



64 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

left behind, not a letter or newspaper was ever de 
livered until she had bought her cargo, very often 
not until she lifted her anchor to go off." 

Though my father seems to have recognized the 
necessity for this rule with regard to letters, I find 
from one of his, dated Canton, July 28, 1831, to 
Mr. J. T. Hay ward (bookkeeper in the Perkins 
house at Boston, who appears to have taken care 
there of his " adventures "), that he could not help 
feeling indignant at the retention for some weeks, 
by one of the captains, of private letters to himself 
and his brother Bennet, which must have contained 
news of three and a half months later date than 
that of their last advices. 

My father s work in Russell & Co. s office was 
very hard, for Mr. Heard was single-handed; but 
he had time for occasional sailing and rowing on 
the Canton River and trips to his cousin, Mr. James 
P. Sturgis, at Macao, and to his brother Bennet, 
who was making a great success of his receiving 
ship, the Lintin, at the port of the same name. 

Partners and clerks in Canton lived all together 

o 

on terms of social equality, but there was not much 
outside sociability, nor was there any marked inci 
dent affecting my father s life. I must give short 
space to the rest of his first stay in China. As to 
his Chinese experience up to this date, he writes in 
1884: 

"What with hard work, tempered by boating 
and an occasional run down to Lintin or Macao, I 
managed to pass three years in China, and then, at 



FIRST VENTURES 65 

the age of twenty, the work or the climate proved 
too much for me, and I was ordered home to re 
cruit. 

" I took passage in the ship Alert, Captain J. W. 
Sever, the same ship which R. H. Dana immortal 
ized by his admirable book, Two Years Before the 
Mast. We reached home about the 6th day of 
June, 1833, and I think I carried the first news of 
my coming, it being considered best not to awaken 
the anxiety of my mother by announcing my inten 
tion." 

He found all well at home, and then followed what 
was most natural. He writes of the coming engage 
ment of his brother Bennet, who had preceded him 
from China, and adds, referring to himself : 

" It was hardly to be expected that a successful 
young man who had been debarred all ladies so 
ciety for three years should escape the contagion. 
I found my sister Mary had grown into a woman, 
and was expecting a visit from two charming young 
ladies of New Bedford who had been schoolmates 
with her at Miss Elizabeth Peabody s school. They 
were twins, and so much alike that nobody could 
tell them apart. I had been to New York on some 
business and expected to find them in the little old 
house on my return. Accordingly one of them, 
Miss Mary Hathaway, appeared, and I was intro 
duced and much charmed ; but she soon went off 
and in came her sister, differently dressed, but so 
wonderfully like her that only the dress saved me 
from making mistakes. This lasted a few hours, 



66 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

when it turned out that Sarah had been prevented 
from coming and that Mary had been masquerading 
in her place by a change of dress. She completely 
took me in, but I don t think had the laugh on 
me for any bad blunders. It was some time in the 
summer of 1833 that Mary Hathaway was married 
to Robert Watson, at New Bedford, where I was 
one of the wedding guests and first saw Sarah 
Hathaway in her own person. . . . Later that sea 
son I made a memorable journey to New York with 
my sisters Emma and Mary, they stopping with 
Aunt Fanny Forbes. We went and called on Sarah 
Hathaway, then taking care of her sister, Mrs. 
Lydia Anthony, at Brooklyn, who was quite ill. 
We persuaded her to join us in a theatrical party, 
I think to see Fanny Kemble. During the play we 
encountered a party of New Bedford friends, whom 
I overheard telling her they were going to New 
Bedford by the Providence steamer next morning 
at eight ; and as she had been waiting for an escort 
for some time she said she would avail herself of 
theirs. I listened, but said nothing until later in 
the evening, when I let out that business called me 
back to Boston. Had it been a voyage to Europe 
for next day, I think the business would have been 
there. So early next day I left my sisters (much, 
I fear, to their disgust) on their aunt s hands, 
and appeared at the Providence steamer ! It was a 
very pleasant voyage to me, however, and somehow 
resulted in an invitation to Governor Swain s, at 
Naushon. . . . My next reminiscence is of starting 



FIRST VENTURES 67 

on " The Judge/ in the saddle, the night before 
Thanksgiving of 1833, sleeping at the Middle- 
borough Pond Hotel, and riding into New Bedford, 
before breakfast, on Thanksgiving Day, but I was 
then engaged, and in high feather." 

And so within eight months of landing he was 
very quietly married to Miss Sarah Hathaway at the 
house of her uncle, William Swain, of New Bed 
ford. Of this marriage I can only say that for 
sixty-four years the good deeds of the husband were 
more than seconded by the wife ; and that all who 
partook of their hospitalities, either at Milton or, 
later on, at Naushon, felt, and were grateful for, the 
cheeriness, buoyancy, and simple mode of life which 
had been brought from the Quaker city, and which 
gave a touch of something informal and original to 
all that was done for others in the home. My 
father refers to the wedding as follows : 

" When it came to the point we found that one 
formality had been omitted, in regard to publish 
ing our intentions/ or as it was then called the 
banns; which, as I was a minor, required some 
further certificate. Our regular pastor was absent, 
and we had to get a Baptist or Methodist clergy 
man, the Eeverend Mr. Chowles, who found out the 
slip at the last moment, but who liberally gave out 
the Dogberry-like sentiment that the law was in 
tended for law-breakers, and need not bind such 
worthy citizens as ourselves ; and so he took the 
responsibility, which indeed had penalties for him 
if for anybody." 



68 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

My father continues : 

" Having these new responsibilities, I now had to 
look about me to earn a living, for though my 
China business had been reasonably successful, my 
salary had been small and I had not accumulated 
much money." 



CHAPTER IV 

LIFE IN CHINA 

BEFORE my father had been a month married 
there came the business offer of which the follow 
ing account is given in his reminiscences : 

" My training in China was so entirely different 
from anything wanted for business in this country 
that when Bryant & Sturgis offered me the chance 
to go supercargo of the ship Logan which they 
were fitting out, and the prospect of another ship 
(the Tartar) following me, I could hardly avoid 
accepting it, cruel as it seemed to leave my wife so 
soon after marriage. Canton had just been opened 
to foreign ladies, but it was very unusual for any to 
accompany their husbands, and besides my wife was 
a martyr to seasickness, and the death of one of her 
sisters had been attributed to a sea voyage ; so it 
seemed impossible to take her with me, and leaving 
her in my mother s family at Milton I reluctantly 
embarked on the 7th of March, 1834, in the ship 
Logan, Captain Henry Bancroft, for Gibraltar 
and China. I took with me as clerk Handasyd 
Cabot, my cousin Mr. Samuel Cabot s eldest son, 
and there were some plans half formed of my join 
ing Perkins & Co. on my return, after perhaps 



70 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

making some arrangements in China for their busi 
ness; but, what has always seemed very strange, 
Mr. Gushing allowed me to embark without even 
having given me the slightest intimation of the 
provisional arrangement which he had made for 
my being admitted to the house of Russell & Co. 
in China, of which I have already spoken." 

The Logan party arrived without incident at 
Gibraltar on March 28, 1834, and were most hos 
pitably entertained by the U. S. Consul, Mr. Hora 
tio Sprague. Here, as the ship took about three 
weeks to load the lead which she was to take to 
China, my father went through the usual round at 
"The Rock," burnt blue lights in St. Michael s 
cave, saw the pretty women strolling on the Ala- 
meda to hear the band play, followed the garrison 
fox hounds, was taken into custody for attempting 
to go in and out of that strictest of fortresses with 
out a pass, and finally took the regulation trip to 
the cork wood convent, where he was kindly 
received by the prior and his company, and allowed 
to contribute some dollars towards " ransoming 
Christian slaves from the Moors." 

The voyage of the Logan to the mouth of the 
Canton River was without excitement, with the ex 
ception of the occasional catching of a shark and 
an abortive attempt at mutiny, which was the more 
exciting because " a great lot of boxes of silver 
dollars " had been taken on board at Gibraltar and 
stowed under the captain s cabin. The mutiny was 
soon quelled and three of the mutineers put in irons, 



LIFE IN CHINA 71 

but released within a few days on the handing over 
by each of them of some cherished possession as 
security for good behavior, and " never was there 
a more quiet crew for the rest of the voyage/ he 
writes. As to books on board ship, it so chances 
that Miss Edgeworth is the only author to whom 
reference is made in his journal, written at the time, 
and of her he says : 

" May 23d. I have been reading some of Miss 
Edgeworth s books lately; I didn t like them 
quite so well as I used to there is too much 
windiness, her characters are too perfect, her plots 
hinge upon too slight and improbable contingencies ; 
then there is always some grateful Irishman, or old 
woman, or six months old baby, or Jew boy, or 
beggar who comes in to the relief of the hero when 
he is in a strait. Good reputations are too easily 
gained and lost ; and then she always furnishes her 
good people at the end with such a glorious set-out. 
Estates fall from the wicked to go to them, they 
have lots of creature comforts, and are perfectly 
happy. The moral is good, the plot bad; for 
truly the wicked are not always punished here, 
externally ; nor the good always rewarded, as far as 



we can see." 



On arriving at Canton early in August, 1834, my 
father found Mr. Heard longing to get away on 
account of the critical state of his health, and at 
odds with Mr. Green, the partner whom he had 
taken into the firm of Russell & Co. on account of 
its overwhelming increase of business. He also 



72 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

learned for the first time that he himself had been 
a partner in the firm since the first of the preceding 
January, so that his share in the profits of the 
house, should he assent to the arrangement, must 
be already much larger than all he could make as 
supercargo of the Logan and Tartar. Even this 
would not have decided him, " but," as he wrote, 
" Mr. Heard insisted that he would stay till he died 
unless I would take his place," and so " I took some 
time to consider the case, but finally decided to sign 
the articles and go to work." Mr. Heard left in 
search of health in the course of the autumn, and, as 
Mr. Coolidge, the only other partner in the house, 
was away in India, the whole work of the firm de 
volved on Mr. Green and my father. Houqua, after 
some demur, consented to transfer his business to 
Russell & Co., stipulating only that my father should 
give it his personal attention. On the 3d of Febru 
ary, 1835, Handasyd Cabot was attacked by small 
pox, and nursed by my father and Mr. Francis Hatha 
way, my mother s cousin, till he died, early in the 
following April. As to one of the dreary distrac 
tions during his cousin s illness, my father writes in 
his journal : 

" April 5, 1835. Whenever I have found time 
lately I have been with Hathaway to a walk whichj 
we have discovered on the other side of the river. 
We land there at five in a sort of suburb, saluted 
by men, women, and children with ( Hillo, you 
foreign devils ! and besides by beggars for cum- 
shas (presents), which we offer with our canes. 



LIFE IN CHINA 73 

We come at last to the country, which is composed 
of barren hillocks covered with tombs, and between 
them paddy fields, which are overflowed at high 
tides the same round day after day; even this 
dreary walk is better than pacing up and down in 
front of the factories." 

On the day following the funeral of Handasyd 
Cabot, Francis Hathaway, having detained his ship 
Horatio for that purpose, took my father with him 
on a trip to Manila. As to this he writes : 

" After the confinement and the strain under 
which I had been, the voyage in a fine ship, with 
good company, good weather, and above all pure 
air, was simply delightful, and I was soon able to 
enjoy life again." 

In a letter to one of his family in Milton, written 
on board ship and dated May 8, 1835, Lat. 17 N., 
Long. 11 E., he says of his Chinese servant : 

" Apee is my valet still. I take him to Manila, in 
the hope that he may run away when he gets there, 
or if not, fall overboard. I am really disgusted 
with him, he is such a clumsy cooly of a fellow, 
and it is only on account of the regard which 
mother has for him 1 that I have not turned him 
adrift fifty times. He cannot get a plate or a glass 
of water without running over a whole room and 
capsizing two or three boys and chairs." 

In about a week they landed at Manila and were 
most hospitably received by Mr. Sturgis. They 

1 He had accompanied my father to Milton on his first return 
from China. ED. 



74 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

remained there two or three weeks and made an 
excursion as to which my father wrote : 

" June 1, 1835. Hathaway, Wood, and I got 
away at about six or seven A. M. in a carriage for 
Santa Anna, where we embarked in a canoe long 
and narrow, two feet by twenty-five; after two 
hours of quick pulling we reached the mouth of the 
lake, where we found another barca, or canoe, a 
little larger than the first; by three o clock we 
reached Wood s house or hut, which is, like the 
Indian houses, built of plain wood, stuck upon 
posts six feet in the air, and very ordinary. We 
proceeded to the house of Don Pablo, the owner of 
all that district and also the head of the police. He 
received us well, and gave H. and myself quarters, 
and after supper we turned in. I had hardly lain 
down, when I heard the most awful noise, women 
screeching, with cries of ( Ladrones ! Ladrones ! 
(robbers) mingled with prayers to the Holy Virgin. 
I seized my dirk, without which no one ever sleeps 
in this country, and ran into the hall, where all the 
household soon appeared, Don Pablo armed to the 
teeth. I was frightened to death, because I knew 
they had $2000 to $3000 in the house, and that 
there was in the neighborhood a band of thirty 
robbers. It turned out that the servant had seen 
a man climbing into her window, who had retreated 
when the alarm was sounded. Don Pablo caught 
him the next morning, and found that he had for 
merly been a servant in the house, and had climbed 
up to make love to one of the maids, but was seen 



LIFE IN CHINA 75 

by the wrong one. He was dismissed with thirty 
lashes. Don Pablo s dress, when he sallied out 
next morning, was a primitive one for a man in his 
station, checked shirt and pants, kept up by a lea 
ther belt, which also supported a most murderous 
knife, made to cut your way through the woods or 
through your enemies, as may be, and called a 
( machete. . . . We spent the next day in visit 
ing Wood, and after dining at twelve started at 
three to visit the mountains. Hathaway was 
mounted on a one-eyed creature that strongly re 
minded one of the Naushon horses, while I had an 
animal that could only be got into a dog-trot by 
severe pummeling. We went on paths that seemed 
almost impracticable on foot, the beasts showing a 
most wonderful sure-footedness. Our guide, an 
Indian, bare to the waist and mounted on a horse 
without a bridle, led the way, with my gun and 
apparatus for which arrangement I have been 
sorely laughed at, though I think it a very rational 
one under such a sun. We dragged on by by-paths, 
zigzag enough, to the top of the mountain, and 
then had a fine view of the lake and the sea. We 
undertook to return by a new path ten times worse 
than the first, had to dismount and lead our horses 
down hills and over gullies that would have puzzled 
a goat, and after getting a mile and seeing two 
deer we had to return, and at sunset found ourselves 
on the top of the mountain, completely at fault. 
I proposed leaving the horses and getting home 
while there was light, but after some trouble the 



76 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Indian found the path, and we got home at seven, 
after four hours of severe exertion on a very hot 
day. Hathaway was desperately done up, but I, 
though tired, was not fatigued, ^and could have 
walked half a dozen miles farther. We were both 
heartily tired of the lakes (a nasty muddy piece of 
water full of green stagnant weed and water snakes, 
which we saw, and alligators which we did not see). 
We had been eaten up by mosquitoes, there being 
no curtains, and had not had a moment s comfort 
since we left, so we got into a canoe at ten p. M., 
and arrived here at ten of the following A. M. I 
never saw Hathaway so completely miserable ; there 
was no place to shave nor to bathe, no good tea, a 
thousand risks to health from midnight air and 
midday sun, and badly cooked dinners ; and all on 
my poor head for leading him into such a scrape. 
I think I never passed three days of such constant 
and disagreeable exposure, and my escaping without 
even a headache proves that my constitution is of 
the strongest and that my days of illness are 
passed." 

In Manila my father bought a pony, which he 
called Augustine in honor of Mr. Heard, and took 
back to Canton. For some time afterwards nothing 
worthy of notice seems to have occurred, but on 
23d November, 1835, I find him writing to my 
mother : 

" Last evening, just as I was beginning to think 
of writing home letters, a tremendous row com 
menced ; a fire had broken out about half a mile 



LIFE IN CHINA 77 

in the rear of the factories ; the wind was blowing 
half a gale towards us. There has been no rain for 
many weeks, and all Canton is dry as tinder and as 
ready to take fire. We had about $300,000 in our 
treasury, and perhaps $50,000 worth of goods in 
the house. I instantly started for Houqua s, and 
such a scene as the narrow streets presented you 
cannot imagine. Bands of armed coolies forcing 
their way along with continued yells, each man 
having his master s name on his cap and on his 
lantern, and I suppose on his tongue ; and the 
parties keeping close together and running, their 
numbers varying from ten to fifty in a party ; the 
rest of the street filled with coolies carrying goods 
from the fire on their shoulders, and having in one 
hand a lantern, and in the other a glittering short 
sword which they flourished constantly, vociferating 
loudly all the while to clear the way. Through 
this dense mass, I shouldered my way, with the help 
of my cooly, to the Hongs, and there found old 
Houqua as cool as if nothing was the matter, sur 
rounded by his men, with water and engines ready 
for the worst. He said there was no danger, but I 
insisted on his lending me a large cargo boat, which 
he sent opposite the factory. I then got home as 
quickly as possible, sent for Dumaresq and our 
other captains, made them write orders for the 
ships boats to come up armed to protect us in case 
of need, and dispatched an express with their let 
ters to Whampoa (ten miles distant) to alarm the 
fleet. By this time the fire had spread perhaps one 



78 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

eighth of a mile in width and was rapidly increas 
ing ; we could hear the cracking of every house as 
it fell, and the cinders and sparks flew over us in 
showers ; the whole sky was lighted, and the square 
in front nearly as light as in the daytime. From 
the top of Sturgis s house it was the most magnifi 
cent sight I ever witnessed, such a mass of red 
flame, with a falling of houses and yells of the 
Chinese, which made such a din as Babel never 
knew ; but it was no time to indulge in admiration 
of the picturesque. We hired as many men as 
could be found, and went to work packing up our 
books and papers ; this we completed before eleven, 
and I then ordered supper for all hands, in the 
full persuasion that it would be the last meal we 
should eat in our house. Our specie all ready 
for removal, I went once more to Houqua, found 
him still up, but his spirits gone ; he now advised 
shipping everything but our money, which he said 
would be safer in the vault than in a boat. We 
returned to the factory, got all our coolies laden ; 
Dumaresq in the boat, armed to the teeth as guard ; 
clerks at our door and at the boat, to take account ; 
and were about starting, when the fire appeared to 
abate. We waited an hour, and thinking the mat 
ter nearly settled in our favor, I gave my boy 
orders to call me if anything new happened, and 
lay down in hopes of getting a nap ; this must have 
been at two. I had not closed my eyes before the 
clamor was renewed, and Green and Dumaresq hur 
ried into my room to say all was lost and the fire 



LIFE IN CHINA 79 

quite close to the factories in a new place. We 
scampered down, harnessed the coolies, and had got 
about half of our luggage into the boats, when the 
new flame was put out and the main fire seemed 
going down. I again stopped sending down to 
the boats, placed a watch, and laid down. In half 
an hour all was uproar again ; we had to set to 
work again, and fairly cleared everything out, and 
at daylight I would not have given sixpence for 
the factories ; the wind was high, the engines (?) had 
reached the city wall, and that was now our only 
protection against it ; on this side were paltry 
wooden houses which, packed close together, ex 
tended to the factories, and seemed to form a train 
for the fire to take ; but the daylight saved us, the 
streets were pulled down now that they could see 
the whole course of the fire, and the necessary mea 
sures to stop it were taken, and in half an hour 
from the point of greatest danger, we were safe, 
just as the boats from the ships arrived. By one 
p. M. we had our house to rights again, gave the 
sailors a jollification, and all parties were well 
pleased with the result except the poor devils of 
Chinese. The number of houses is estimated at 
from 2000 to 3000 destroyed ; put it at 1000, and 
you have 10,000 houseless heads ; many shops were 
burned, and as there is no insurance, hundreds of 
men who were last night prosperous have now only 
the labor of their hands to look to for support, in 
a country where the hardest labor of strong men 
barely earns food and clothes enough to sustain 



80 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

life. This fire has leveled half a mile square of a 
populous city. Houqua told me he had men ready 
to pull down the street which lined the western wall 
of the city, and that he had promised the occupants, 
if he was obliged to do it, to build their houses new 
at his own expense. The authorities seem subdued 
from their usual insolence by this awful calamity, 
and have not opposed the entrance of foreigners into 
the usually sacred walls of the city. I went this 
p. M. with Hathaway, mounted the wall, and walked 
on the top of it for half a mile, during which we 
met with civility, for the first time in all my resi 
dence in China ; or rather, we did not meet with a 
single insult a miracle. We descended from the 
wall, which is perhaps ten feet thick and eighteen 
feet high, by steps which led into the midst of the 
ruins, which were blazing close to the wall ; we 
were trying to penetrate over the rubbish into the 
interior of the city, when a petty mandarin turned 
us back civilly and without insult. 

" I have been so constantly on the move that my 
feet are as sore as if I had been on a long journey, 
and my eyes swelled and bloodshot, from ashes and 
want of sleep. Do not mention my name in con 
nection with Houqua s ; it would seem ostentatious 
to speak of my intimacy with the old hero, and 
though it might give me notoriety, I don t care to 
shine with borrowed light ; I shall be content with 
what share of respect I can command for myself." 

Bearing in mind how large a part of my father s 



LIFE IN CHINA 81 

work in after life was devoted to railroads, and how 
successful he became in their management, it seems 
the irony of fate to find that his first feeling to 
wards them was one of distrust and dislike. His 
brother Bennet had written from Boston suggesting 
the investment in railroads of some funds of my 
father s of which he had charge there. To this 
suggestion my father replied : 

CANTON, January 9, 1836. 

MY DEAR BENNET, The principal object of the 
present is to request that you will by no means 
invest any funds of mine in railway stocks, and to 
advise you to keep clear of them. I have good 
reasons to believe, from all I can learn of the Eng 
lish railways, that ours will prove a failure after the 
first few years ; the wear and tear proves ruinous. 
At any rate, keep clear of them. Three ships going 
this week. I am very well, and quite busy. 
Ever yours most affectionately, 

J. M. FORBES. 

Towards the end of this his second and last resi 
dence in China my father spent some time in Macao 
in a house taken by himself and Francis Hatha 
way ; but as this was a small one, Dr. and Mrs. 
Colledge, friends whom he had made there, lent 
him their house for a farewell fancy ball which he 
proposed giving in acknowledgment of the many 
hospitalities he had received. The following is his 
account of it, written at the time : 



82 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

" September 12th, 1836. I undertook to invite 
some Portuguese, and have made a mess of it ; quar 
reled with half the town. I to-day called on the 
governor ; he and his suite will come, also some 
English army officers. I have eighty-four on my 
list of accepted. I am to have a green satin frock 
coat ornamented with green cording, white satin 
tights, white Spanish boots, a hat and feather, 
simply a crown hat looped up on one side. Both 
men and ladies have been most obliging ; one looks 
after the decorations of the house, another the light 
ing, etc. . . . 

" At the ball the first who entered was a Turk in 
full costume, looking quite a character ; then a Ger 
man student, then a lady in court dress ; nearly all 
the gentlemen in coats, which I at once asked them 
to change for white jackets. As the room filled, 
the effect was most brilliant ; several ladies came as 
nuns, as Swiss peasants, Spanish ladies, etc., all 
very much dressed and ornamented. I soon lost all 
tremor, and entered into the full enjoyment of the 
thing. One man came dressed as a woman, and I 
did not find it out for some time. Three captains 
came in Moorish and Parsee dresses ; no one would 
have detected them, unless from knowledge of their 
features they looked and acted their characters 
perfectly. So did another captain, who came dressed 
as a good old English country gentleman. Pre 
sently Alexander Eobertson entered, in full Spanish 
costume, brilliantly ornamented, and in attendance 
on a Spanish lady in black hat and feathers and 



LIFE IN CHINA 83 

black bodice on a white dress (Mrs. Stewart). Then 
came a Jack Tar in company with an Englishman 
dressed in trousers representing the stripes and a 
jacket of stars intended to mean the Yankee flag ; 
then an Arab, a Turk, and a Greek. All seemed 
in good - humor, and just filled the rooms enough. 
There were about forty plain dresses, and thirty or 
more fancy ones. After hot coffee we began dan 
cing. The lady highest in point of rank was Mrs. 
Elliot, wife of one of the British superintendents ; 
but she had rather discouraged my party, and came 
in a plain dress, so I led out Mrs. Daniel for the 
first dance ; she had taken a strong part in my 
favor, and indeed, with one or two others, had fairly 
carried the thing through. She was dressed fan 
cifully, in something between Swiss and Spanish, 
and as usual looked pretty. At twelve we supped 
at small tables in the veranda. I led in Mrs. Elliot. 
Captain Elliott got up in a chair, and made a long 
speech about me and my party, and then proposed 
my health, with cheers, which seemed much out of 
place among ladies. In due time I got up and 
thanked all present for the honor they had done me 
in accepting my invitations, etc., and finally pro 
posed as a toast, The bright eyes of Macao. When 
supper was over we had a few songs, then dancing 
and waltzing until nearly three A. M. I never saw 
so brilliant a party anywhere, not even at the gar 
rison fancy ball at Gibraltar. It could not have 
gone better, and Inglis (of Dent & Co.) is already 
insisting on another when the weather gets cooler. 



84: JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

" 16th. Now for the disagreeable part of the ball. 
It is very likely to lead to some ball practice of an 
unpleasant nature. I asked a Portuguese gentle 
man (Sr. R ) to name to me a few Portuguese 

who were proper persons to be asked if I chose ; 
well, he sent me a list of twenty-three people, from 
which I crossed off three garrison officers and sent 
him notes for the rest, informing him that the 
gentlemen outnumbered the ladies already very 
much, and that I had therefore omitted a few of 
the bachelors on his list. I employed his clerk to 
write the invitations, and he sent them to Captain 
Lonero, with the list containing the crossed-off 
ones. The crosses were laid to R. s account, as he 
does not speak to the other. My navy friend and 
his wife immediately sent a refusal, and none of the 
list accepted. The morning after the party, I found 
on my table a note from the gentleman, asking an 
explanation of my conduct, and since then I have 
been carrying on a pistol and dagger sort of cor 
respondence. The officers are vaporing and talk 
ing of satisfaction, and the captain writes letters of 
dangerous consequences if I refuse to give up R. s 
name as accessory to the crucifixion. In my first 
letter, I made all the concessions and apologies that 
I intended to, and as it now stands, I have told my 
peppery friend that I alone am responsible for my 
own omissions and invitations. I am staying at 
home now in momentary expectation of a visit from 
some of the garrison officers. This is not very 
pleasant, it keeps me from going to Canton. I 



LIFE IN CHINA 85 

don t think it will come to anything am pretty 
much decided not to risk my life against any of 
the creatures. I shall not go out, unless quite con 
vinced that my reputation would suffer by refus- 
ing." 

My father waited all day for his not forthcoming 
challenger, and then returned to Canton and work, 
and on the 5th of the following November I find 
him in Macao again, and writing : 

" Yesterday was a fine bright day, and with De 
lano I started for the Lappa, a hilly island half a 
mile from Macao. We went at eleven, walked 
about a couple of miles to the top of a high hill, 
and there in the sun and breeze upon the bonnie 
Highland heather it was delicious ; a splendid 
view on all sides, and then the wild rugged loneli 
ness of the spot surrounded by heath-covered hills, 
so different from Canton, and indeed from all tropi 
cal scenery. I could easily have imagined myself 
on one of our own barren hills, for there were no 
trees, except a few stunted pines, contrasting well 
with the brown grass. We gathered some wild- 
flowers, and some running evergreen and fern, and 
heather for Mrs. Sturgis, and had some good runs 
over the hilltops, and drank out of a leaf from a 
pure stream of clear water, and then laid down in 
the sun for a couple of hours." 

This period of my father s life, which ended in 
December, 1836, embraced that of the giving up 
by the East India Company of their monopoly of 
the English trade with China. This led to a large 



86 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

influx of Englishmen, to the forming of a club, the 
Union, of which he was a member, and much socia 
bility and festivity not before existing ; under the 
strain of which British official reserve seems to have 
broken down entirely, as appears from the following 
extract : 

" Sometimes we raced our boats on the way to 
the baseball grounds, then played leap-frog along 
the dikes towards the upland. In out-of-door 
sports the Englishman has perforce to drop his in 
sular dignity and become democratic, and he never 
does it by halves. Often we found ourselves hold 
ing, or jumping over, the head of a high dignitary 
of the company s service in India, who, when at 
home, held power of life and death over thousands 
of natives ; and perhaps when the game was organ 
ized for ball the same official would be found ( tend 
ing out in his turn or getting pelted by the hard 
ball as he tried to run in, for it was then the fash 
ion to throw at the runner, and if hit he was out for 
that inning. I think we had no quarrels, and that 
the best spirit prevailed between the American and 
foreign residents. The Laird of Innes was not, I 
think, a member, but some of Jardine & Co. were, 
and the whole effect of the club was civilizing." 

In looking back, in 1884, to his mercantile ex 
perience in China, my father speaks of the strict 
honor of the Chinese merchant, and sums up with, 
" I never saw in any country such a high average 
of fair dealing as there." When his agreed term 
was expiring, though it was at the busy time of the 



LIFE IN CHINA 87 

year, he could not of course consent to stay longer. 
He writes : 

" So, after making arrangements with Mr. Green 
for a moderate share, I think three sixteenths, of 
Russell & Co. s business for three years while at 
tending to its interests in the United States, I took 
passage for home in the Luconia, Captain Charles 
Pearson. . . . The afternoon of our sailing comes 
back to me, with my sensations as I paced the deck, 
just as clearly as if it were yesterday, and I recall 
the very tune I was humming nearly sixty years 
since ; it was Moore s 

1 There s a bower of roses by Bendemeer s stream, 
And the nightingale sings round it all the day long. " 

The Luconia s run was fast (120 days), and with 
out incident, till she was nearing New York, when 
my father writes in his journal : 

" Four days since, I was reading in the cabin, 
when, about four P. M., I heard a fall on deck; 
then down came some one saying a man had fallen 
from the mast and was killed. I went up to see 
what I could do, being less flustered than the rest. 
I found it was a poor boy, the favorite of all on 
board. My old friend Brown was holding him in 
his arms and trying to bring him to. ... The boy 
was the son of a country physician, and being in 
delicate health, a sea voyage had been necessary 
after he had prepared for college. He could not 
afford to pay for his passage, and had shipped as a 
sailor boy ; he had been ill several times, and when 



88 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

we sailed was dangerously so. I then got inter 
ested for him, used to go and see him and try to 
keep up his spirits, and when he was well enough 
to read lent him books. He got well, and was per 
fectly recovered and grown very stout, with every 
prospect of being home in a week, when this unac 
countable accident happened; it was nearly calm, 
and he was in the mizzen top, where any lubber can 
go without danger. He was a gentle, kindly boy, 
and must have been dearly loved at home. . . . 
Poor fellow, I came nearer shedding more tears for 
him than I have before for many years. I was 
much touched, too, to find that his clothes were 
coarse as any of the crew s, and that he had spent 
his little earnings in buying at Canton a couple of 
pair of velvet slippers and a box of gay fans, pre 
sents, no doubt, for his father and mother. . . . 
Four o clock p. M. was appointed for the funeral ; I 
dragged myself to the deck ; the sky was black, 
with every indication of an approaching gale ; the 
ship was plunging swiftly on ; every blast seemed 
louder than the last. The crew were collected at 
the gangway. The body, sewed up in a sheet, with 
shot at the feet to sink it, was placed on a board 
which rested on the gunwale, and covered with the 
American flag. Captain Pearson read the Church 
of England service to as sober a set of men as I 

o 

ever laid eyes on, not a few brushing away a tear 
now and then. At the sentence, &lt; We commit his 
body to the deep, the flag was removed, and his 
messmates raised the board till the body plunged 
into the sea, and we sped swiftly on our way." 



LIFE IN CHINA 89 

A few days later, after an exasperating interval 
of contrary winds, my father landed in New York 
(March, 1837), and as to what followed he writes : 

" The Providence steamer was then the only 
short way of reaching home, and the next forenoon 
found me snugly harbored at my aunt James Per 
kins s, in Pearl Street, where my wife, perhaps by 
accident, met me after an absence of a little over 
three years." 



CHAPTER V 

TEN YEAES OF BUSINESS 

DURING the latter part of my father s stay in 
China my uncle Bennet had seen to building for 
him on Milton Hill the cottage which, with some 
additions, is now occupied by my brother Malcolm ; 
and here he found my mother already established. 

My father had left China in December, 1836, 
when no warning of any commercial storm had 
reached Russell & Co. He did not anticipate hav 
ing more to do than to attend quietly to the 
interests of the firm in the United States, and 
expected therefore to take life more easily than had 
been possible for him in Canton. 

But this was not to be. When he landed in New 
York, in March, 1837, he found the business world 
in wild confusion. The three great banking-houses 
in London, Wiggins, Wilson, and Wilde (familiarly 
remembered as the three W s), through whom the 
greater part of the Chinese- American business had 
been done, had failed, and only Baring Bros, and 
the Browns stood firm. He found that Russell & 
Co. had drawn bills for over 400,000 sterling on 
the three broken bankers, and that these bills had 
at once to be provided for ; a matter simple enough 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 01 

had the Chinese goods represented by the bills, and 
on their way to the United States to sundry cor 
respondents of Russell & Co., continued to hold the 
values which ruled at the time of their shipment ; 
but these had fallen during the panic to such a 
point as to make it impossible for weak correspond 
ents, and impolitic for tricky ones, to make prompt 
remittances to London to take up the dishonored 
bills. One of these latter did refuse to do this and 
caused much trouble, but most of the houses for 
whom the shipments had been made did whatever 
was needed to sustain their own and Russell & Co. s 
credit, notably, as my father says in 1884, in look 
ing back to this time, that of " the square, unpre 
tending Tom Wigglesworth ; " and the storm was 
successfully weathered. 

Russell & Co. s affairs, however, were not his 
only care at this period. During the panic his 
brother Bennet, too, had suffered, and at his own 
request had gone once more to China to take my 
father s place in Russell & Co. 

One of his brother s business difficulties had to 
do with some nail works in Farrandsville, Pa., and 
thither in the spring of 1838 my father took a trip, 
accompanied by Mr. Russell, of Plymouth, on whom 
he had called for advice as an expert in the busi 
ness. 

I give part of a letter written by him during this 
trip, as it may bring home to the minds of those of 
my readers who feel aggrieved when, on any forced 
journey, a Pullman car is denied them, what such an 



92 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

undertaking was in the days of their grandfathers. 
He writes, in April, 1838 : 

FABRANDSVILLE HOTEL. 

..." Landed day before yesterday at Lewiston 
at eight A. M. ; went right to a livery stable ; could 
get a carry-all and pair of horses for $ 10, but they 
would only travel four miles an hour. Went to 
another, found a ruffianly looking fellow whose man 
would drive five miles an hour ; told him to hitch 
on two pretty, little, spirited horses, who soon 
started off with your humble servant, Mr. Russell, 
and a way passenger to go two miles, with an Irish 
eighteen-year-old to drive. We two in the hind 
seat of a carry-all, very like our veteran, only I 
could not get up the top to keep off the sun ; most 
luckily. Glorious day ; found Pat was for prancing 
along ; forbade this ; got down first hill pretty 
well, but Mr. R. scary. Was telling him of my 
fall from Kate (in Boston) just as we crowned the 
second hill ; says I, She threw me so far as to clear 
her, or else Hullo ! driver, mind your hand ! 
Kick ! kick ! Pat frightened, pulled his left rein ; 
both horses went up on a four-foot steep bank, and 
over went carry-all, without my having power to 
stir from my seat. I scrambled out of the road 
unhurt, except my umbrella knocked into pi te 
poor plack crow ; sprang to the horses heads, and 
with the aid of passers-by and the driver, who had 
kept his feet and the reins, stopped the kicking 
horses and righted the carry-all, which was turned

bottom up, not a strap broken, not a bone, my two 
companions rubbing their shins, I unscathed, the 
driver exulting over his unbroken leathers, and I in 

O 

a gale at the comicality of the whole thing, espe 
cially Mr. R/s fright and distress, though hardly 
bruised at all. ( Noo, says Pat, get ye in ; no 
fear noo ; I 11 warrant ye safe. Mr. R. would not 
set foot in that again, would go back to Lewiston. 
After consultation we agreed to walk down the 
mountain and see how the horses went, etc. ; then 
I got in and took care, sitting in front, that Pat 
should not let horses get excited again, and with 
some difficulty I controlled him, and Mr. R. s fears 
gradually subsided. Glorious day and splendid 
scenery, mountains, river, brook, rocks, and trees, 
giant trees such as I never saw before ; wild roads 
like those in Berkshire specked with riders in sad 
dle, men and women in groups, going up to a plain, 
log-hut, Methodist church ; not a vehicle in the way 
but ours ; and at the church the grouping was fine, 
of horses tied under the forest trees, and the plain 
old church, and plain old country-looking people. 
Stopped at the post-office to borrow a wafer, and 
at the next (Pattie s Mills) put my letter in. At 
twelve, or one P. M., found a nice house kept by a 
Boston man ; his daughters tend the table dressed 
in black silk gowns and looking quite ( genteel, 
but modest withal. Heard much of the iron works 
from Mr. Coverly, a shrewd Yankee who has made 
his fortune here, as he told us, though, says he, 
&lt;God made me and my brothers just the poor, 



94 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

broken-down, weakly looking critters that you see 
I am. Heard that our horses were celebrated as 
being the most vicious in the country. Through a 
beautiful country, and much tribulation, we passed 
first Pennsylvania Valley, fertile and picturesque; 
then the mountain, which was on fire not far from 
us, if smoke told true ; and finally reached Belfonte 
(read Cooper s Pioneer for a description of this 
valley), a most dirty village, finely placed on one of 
the most perfect spots I ever saw. At five P. M. 
went to a tavern and asked where was a livery stable 
only one in the place tried to make the man 
start off and get twelve miles on our way to-night, 
but the innkeeper gave him a wink on hearing Mr. 
R. talking to me about the danger of night travel, 
and so would not go till morning, and wanted $11 ; 
whereas our pay from first post, at $10, was ex 
orbitant for thirty miles. Offered him $10, and 
start at this hour in the A. M. Let him go, after 
telling him that I was aware that I must expect 
Scripture rule, When saw ye a stranger and took 
him not in, but I would not be bled too much if I 
had to walk. Sent for W. Manly, brother of a man 
at the works, now in the shoe business at Belfonte, 
shook hands with him, told him I must have a 
carry-all to start early next A. M., and would pay 
$10, etc., said he d try. Came in and told us 
he had borrowed a carry-all left there for sale and a 
horse to go with his three-year-old colt, neither ever 
before in double harness. (Mem. Never hire carry 
alls left for sale, and especially eschew old blood 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 95 

mares rather walk.) Poor Mr. R. remonstrated 
against going over the hills in this plight, but I told 
him I would not submit to the livery stable keeper s 
charges, after once sending him off, if it cost double 
money and risk. Woke before day, dressed and 
mustered up Manly, determined to succeed, and 
such a team as we had ! A flashy carry-all, a lanky 
gray three-year-old colt, and a white, very old, and 
spirited blood mare, each carrying the head as far 
as possible from the other. Found Manly afraid of 
them, so insisted on driving myself, and well it 
was I did. All aboard ! Mr. R. trembling 
All aboard ! (Mem. Heard that yesterday s 
team smashed a carry-all the last time they were 
here and had to be ridden back.) Started on the 
jump, hauling Colty along. Soon brought her to 
bearings and gradually made them know my voice 
a little (lucky) ; got along well enough for eleven 
miles over a decent road sprinkled with stumps and 
holes (my driving much admired), everybody we 
met on horseback. Stopped at a Dutch inn and 
had a long argument on politics with an old Dutch 
farmer ; did not hope to convert him, only wanted 
a little fun ; Mr. R. quite indignant at the old fel 
low s putting Washington and Jackson together ; I 
told him W. was a real Federalist and bank man, 
and he ought not to praise him. (Mem. May tame 
a tiger, find a silent woman, catch the sea-serpent, 
but convince a Dutchman, never !) A mile farther 
met a train of covered wagons, men with rifles, 
women and children walking, bound West. A little 



96 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

farther on, Manly sang out, Hold hard ! Wo- 
o-o ! says I, pulling up just in time to avoid an 
other capsize. Fore wheel, starboard side, just on 
the axletree ; stopped half an hour, got a staple from 
a farmhouse and drove it in half way. There/ 
says Manly, that 11 go forever ! The white crit 
ter pranced, and off we went again. Came to a 
long hill ; then says Manly, Let them go down 
lively, Mr. F. No/ says I, that won t do here. 
Just then they began to go it, and I to hold on, 
both horses prancing, Whitey kicking like a devil 
right against the dasher. Turn them up that 
bank/ says M. Wo-o-o ! says I, holding hard, 
( I ve had enough of banks ! So after a while 
I stopped them in the road, instead of turning 
over again ; got out, and lengthened the traces so 
as to bring the horses farther from the carriage. 
The two men walked, and I drove down the hill, 
horses still very restive. Near the bottom the 
staple came out and wheel nearly off again. Bet 
ter look at the other wheels/ said I. ( They are 
all right, I 11 secure/ said Manly, a harum-scarum 
dog. Look/ says I. Hollo ! here s another 
linch-pin gone. I do believe/ says he, that 
skillful livery man took em out. Fix it/ says 
I. ( Boy, where is there a smith? A little piece 
on. So on we went, they walking, I watching my 
wheel, which varied from one to six inches on the 
axle ; found the smith and set him to work making 
pins. That nearly done, I thought I would take a 
look at all the fixtures of the carry-all. Hollo 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 97 

no wonder the horses kicked ! The bolt by which 
the pole holds back the carry-all was gone, and 
the jamming of the pole between two small pieces 
of wood was all that kept us from the horses heels ; 
the next hill would have fixed us. In two hours 
the new bolt pins were made, and off we went. Our 
only trouble now was, that at every ascent the tired 
horses would stop. Whitey began to act, and one 
of us got out and led them again, and jumped in 
without stopping. Dined at Lockhaven, found G. 
B. Manly. Crossed the river and started for Far- 
randsville along the towpath (river on one side, 
ditch on the other) twelve feet high and twelve feet 
wide at the top. Frequent stops, coaxings, whip 
pings, and starts. At one of these, as we were 
starting pretty quick, and I holding in, I found the 
horses steering right for the river, off the track, 
which was here a little wider than usual, say twenty 
feet. In vain I pulled the other rein, then by roar 
ing W o-o-o ! stopped the horses just on the 
edge. My right rein had caught in the runner by 
a buckle, and by pulling both to hold, I was steer 
ing into the river. Arrived here at four p. M. 
Looked at the works, slept soundly, and from a 
bright heavenly day woke up to this snowstorm." 

I am sorry not to find any account of my father s 
return trip, but, strange to say, it must have been 
safely accomplished. Looking back on this period 
he writes : 

" The care of R. B. F. s affairs and my work for 



98 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Russell & Co., with the sales of consignments from 
China, gave me little leisure for two or three years, 
but were a very valuable training in American busi 
ness. My direct relations with Houqua continued 
after my return from China." 

As to these relations I give extracts here from 
two of Houqua s letters to my father : 

CANTON, May 4, 1837. 

MY YOUNG FRIEND, It is several weeks since I 
have called on an amanuensis to pen for me a letter 
to you, and I do so now to show you that notwith 
standing my age and the many cares which oppress 
me, I bear you in mind. Before you receive this 
you will probably have been at home more than six 
months. I count on seeing you again, probably 
before another year is ended, and shall be most 
glad to welcome you back. . . . You must recollect 
that I have given you authority to manage my busi 
ness, and I do not wish you to delegate it to any 
one unless you should come back to China, and 
then you must leave the power in the hands of the 
consignees of the property, or if they should not be 
trustworthy, in those of some other safe house. . . . 
Mr. Green has reminded me several times that I 
promised to sit for my portrait for you, but as yet 
I have had no leisure. 

Pray don t neglect to write to me, 

I remain, your friend, 

HOUQUA. 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 99 

THE SAME TO THE SAME. 

CANTON, August 10, 1838. 

MY YOUNG FRIEND, I have received your letter 
of March 3. By the Levant I make you a consider 
able consignment of tea and silk piece goods, which 
I have had on hand for some time, and cannot sell 
here. I wish you to consult Mr. Gushing about 
the sale of this consignment and to follow his 
advice. Eemember, security is my first object : I 
desire to run no unnecessary risks, and want, if 
possible, to have the accounts closed early. ... It 
gives me much pleasure to hear of your good health, 
though you say nothing of your son s. You know 
it is an ambition common to my countrymen to 
have many sons, and I confess I feel inclined to 
congratulate my friends when I hear that they are 
contributing their quota to posterity in this way. 
My grandson sends his regards, to which, my dear 
friend, I add my own most sincerely, 

HOUQUA. 

It was in the interval between the dates of these 
letters of Houqua that an event occurred which 
was the first to startle all New England out of the 
indifference about slavery ; and (with what followed 
it) it strongly affected my father s after life. This 
was the murder of Elijah P. Love joy, 1 a clergyman 
who had tried printing a newspaper at St. Louis, 
in which he condemned the burning of a negro. 
For this offense his press had been destroyed. He 

1 At Alton, November 7, 1837. 



100 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

had retreated to the Illinois side of the Missis 
sippi and managed to set up another press, which 
shared the fate of the first. He scraped together 
enough money to set up a third. But this was too 
much for the Missouri mob, who this time crossed 
the river in force, killed Lovejoy, and burned up 
press, building, and all. This aroused Boston at 
last. An indignation meeting was proposed by Dr. 
Channing, but so strong was the hold of slavery in 
those da^s that the use of Faneuil Hall was granted 
only after much urging. The meeting was held, 
but the upholders of slavery were to the fore in 
great numbers ; they made so much noise that it 
seemed doubtful whether the meeting would indorse 
Love joy or his murderers, when a young man climbed 
to the platform, and, with a voice which never after 
wards failed of holding his audience, made a speech 
which turned the tide completely. Of it my father 
says : 

"I was present by chance and heard Wendell 
Phillips, then almost unknown, break out in his 
great speech, perhaps the best he ever made, de 
nouncing the murder. I had never before heard 
his name, and few people outside of his class in 
college knew him as a man of talent. Up to that 
time I had been neutral or indifferent on the sub 
ject of slavery. That speech changed my whole 
feeling with regard to it, though the bigotry and 
pigheadedness of the abolitionists prevented my act 
ing with them." 

To return to the calmer atmosphere of my father s 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 101 

agency for Houqua in Boston ; I need only add 
that, as time went on, it did not stop at Chinese and 
other merchandise, but embraced general invest 
ments in this country. I find him saying, when 
recalling that period : 

" I had saved up the moderate competency which 
I had brought home from China, and was owning 
ships and doing a commission business with good 
credit, based upon what I had done in that country 
and upon somewhat exaggerated ideas on the part 
of my correspondents, due to my having the man 
agement of about half a million of my friend Hou 
qua s money. This, at his especial request, was 
held in my own name, though the ownership was 
indicated in my books by the initials A. S. I., which 
meant American Stock Investment. This account 
was kept carefully unmixed with my own invest 
ments, although I made it a rule never to buy any 
thing for it which I was not also buying for myself." 

Then he goes on to speak of different fine ships in 
which he was interested in those days, and adds : 

" These were then called clippers, although a few 
years later, when for California we built yachts of 
1500 to 2500 tons, they would have been called 
clumps." 

With regard to one of these ships, the Acbar, 
I find the following instructions given by him to 
her captain, Philip Dumaresq, when she was about 
to leave Boston for Canton in 1839. I insert these 
in full as illustrative of the methods of business in 
those days, and of my father s careful forethought : 



102 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

" CAPT. P. DUMARESQ, On making the coast 
of China, please have a letter to Mr. K. B. F. 
ready, stating what cargo and funds you have on 
board, and that unless there is some extraordinary 
inducement to buy teas, your object is to employ 
the ship either in some freighting business in the 
East (cotton being your first object if there is a fair 
prospect), or, if nothing can be got except rice, in 
taking freight to this part of the world. Tell him 
where you mean to anchor, and ask information by 
return boat as to the state of affairs, 1 and advice as 
to taking your ship to Lintin, and taking very 
quietly a pilot at once, or waiting among the 
islands, if anything secret is to be done, until you 
can see him and concert measures. Give him all 
the information you can as to the markets, ships, 
etc. When you are boarded by a Fast Boat, if 
they lead you to believe that the Americans are at 
Canton and will agree at once to carry up a letter, 
anchor in some out-of-the-way place, and send the 
boat up with such letters only as are marked to be 
put up, for it would not be safe to risk others : 
make the Fast Boat man s pay depend on his keep 
ing your arrival secret and on bringing you an 
answer within a stipulated time. If upon cross- 
examining the Fast Boat men you have any doubt 
about the Americans being at Canton and you can 
ascertain that the Lintin, Captain Oilman, is still 
outside, send one of your mates to the Lintin. Tell 

1 War between England and China was expected when these 
instructions were made out. ED.

x 

him, without letting out where he comes from, to 
find out where Mr. Forbes is and to forward to him 
your letter as quickly as possible. If you cannot 
satisfy yourself that the Lintin is outside, send your 
mate to Macao with like orders and cautions. Keep 
back all letters and papers, except such as you have 
orders about, until you get advice from Canton that 
they may be delivered without injury to us. The 
reason for thus trying to keep your arrival secret 
may be either, that it is an object, from any cause, 
to buy at once to extent of your funds, with the 
market to yourself ; or it may be that the negotia 
tions of the English with the Chinese are just at 
such a point, that if it were known to the former 
that an American ship was going up they would 
give her warning that she went up with the risk of 
being kept in (an informal notice it would be, but 
still might be embarrassing) ; or it may be that if 
they had nearly decided to commence a blockade, 
they might reason, Here is an American ship going 
in and it is a good time to begin : when if they did 
not know of any vessel going up, a day or two s 
delay on their part might turn the scale in favor of 
the voyage by letting you slip in lawfully. In 
case no China boat came near you, you would have 
to go either on to Macao Roads or to Lintin, and 
then keep your own counsel and your letters until 
you could act advisedly. 

" In writing E. B. F. it would be well to give 
him a copy of our other instructions to you about 
cargo, and to authorize him if necessary to act 



104 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

upon them promptly without awaiting a reference 
to you. 

" As it is possible you may on arrival, or after 
wards, be below Canton, while that port is in a state 
of blockade, we would in these private instructions 
give you our ideas with regard to the risks we shall 
be willing to run. 

" 1st. If you can at any time get into port be 
fore the blockade, it might be very important for 
you to wait until the time allowed by the blockad 
ing squadron to come off with cargo had expired, 
in order to get teas down in consequence of other 
vessels being off. Again, you might be able by 
a false start for sea from Macao Roads to return 
(after a blockade commenced) and get into the 
river without much risk. Again, you might per 
haps be able to get in back of Macao in some snug 
bay, or even run up to Hong Kong (at the end of 
Broad way passage), and then by concert meet 
cargo boats from Canton. Under such circum 
stances we should be willing to have you take either 
of these steps, provided, after a full knowledge of all 
the chances, you and Mr. Forbes agree that the 
object, the prospect of gain, was much greater than 
the risk. If the British fleet should from any cause 
be placed as they were during the war, viz., at or 
about Chunpa only, we should think a well-con 
certed run in might be made with but little risk, 
and that you might by watching your chance run 
out with little or no risk ; but if, as is likely, the 
Chinese block up the river, or the English take the 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 105 

forts and send a ship to Whampoa, you would stand 
no chance of escape. Unless, therefore, there is 
strong probability of their staying at Chunpa and 
taking half measures, it would be highly imprudent 
to run in or stay in. We will only say, however, 
that we should be willing to take a small risk for 
the chance of a very great gain, and with this re 
mark shall agree to whatever you and Mr. F. may 
decide under such circumstances. 

" Remember that in case of a blockade the Chi 
nese would pardon your running into the river 
without a pilot, and secondly that if you had secret 
notice or strong enough suspicion to warrant such a 
step, you might (having no notice that could be 
proved upon you) take a good chance and run for 
the river, with only the risk of being stopped and 
turned back." 

It would seem that war had actually broken out 
between Great Britain and China when the Acbar 
arrived off the coast, but that all consequent dif 
ficulties were met ; so that this voyage was referred 
to afterwards as unusually successful. 

To return to his Milton life and its amusements. 
Prominent among these was tree planting, which 
all through life was one of my father s chief inter 
ests and occupations "out of office hours." One 
of the first things he did after buying " the Briggs 
lot," on Milton Hill, in 1834, on which during his 
second voyage to China his cottage was built for 



106 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

him, was to import about 20,000 trees, of which 
white pine and Norway spruce were his favorites, and 
so to shut out the bare expanse of Neponset mud- 
bank which lay below the place to the north. This 
belt of trees, as time went on, made a barrier against 
the north and east winds, not only for the cottage, 
but for the house, which he afterwards built about 
a quarter of a mile to the east of it. The whole 
place was very bleak and bare when he bought it, 
and the tree and evergreen shrub planting com 
pletely transformed it. Indeed, after a time, it be 
came necessary to open views of Boston Bay, and it 
was always a struggle for him to cut down any of 
these cherished objects, even when he recognized 
that one tree hindered the perfection of another s 
growth. Later on at Naushon, where Governor 
Swain had already made some beginning in tree 
planting, my father continued it with great zest, 
trying experiments of various sorts to the end of 
his life. 

Eiding was always one of his chief enjoyments. 
He looked back fondly to the black mare, named 
Di Vernon, which he had bought for my mother, 
and the Judge, a three quarters bred chestnut, of 
which his brother Bennet gave him the use. My 
father s order to the groom, when requiring these 
to be saddled, " Saddle the Judge and Di," was, as 
he recalls, long remembered. The Judge was left 
with him when his brother returned to China in 
1837 ; and my father tells how that spirited ani 
mal, soon after this, came near breaking his neck 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 107 

and that of Governor Swain, already a very heavy 
man. As they were driving into Boston, the Judge 
ran away with the chaise for a mile at full speed, 
my father and the governor both holding on to the 
reins, and contriving to pull him in just as he was 
on the point of dashing down the Boston side of 
Meeting-House Hill. The governor alighted and 
made for a house. My father exclaimed, " Where 
are you going, governor ? " "To get a gun to 
kill that horse." " Get in, governor, and go on." 
" Not for ten thousand dollars," said the governor, 
" will I ever sit behind that horse again." My 
father winds up with, " Of his (the horse s) career I 
remember nothing except that, some time after, he 
ran away with somebody else and broke his neck 
against an iron fence." 

It must have been in the thirties that Johnny 
Crapaud, the queer little animal already mentioned, 
came to Naushon, where he was to pass the re 
mainder of his life. Captain Anthony, of New 
Bedford, on a voyage to Havre, saw Johnny there, 
carrying a rider twice his own size, took pity on 
him, brought him home, and presented him to Gov 
ernor Swain. Johnny was the incarnation of intel 
ligence and mischief, could open gates and let all 
the horses into the cornfields, and was withal the 
only steed I ever heard of which the governor s 
wife, my quiet Quaker aunt Lydia, would mount. 
He suited her exactly, for she could knit tranquilly 
on his back. 

I may as well say here that he was translated in 



108 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

1864, at no one knows exactly what age, but cer 
tainly over thirty-five. He disappeared one day, 
and though all the swamps at his end of the island 
were searched, his small body was never found. 1 

1 I give here his epitaph, in which my father took great delight, 
written by the Rev. John Weiss ; perhaps one of the cleverest of the 
contributions to the " Island Book," a book wherein were inscribed 
all names of family and guests at Naushon, with such verses and 
skits as the poetry or wit of the visitors afforded : 

This Page 
Is dedicated to the Memory of 

Johnny Crapaud: 
Who emigrated from Havre, France, 

In disgust 

At carrying a rider twice as large 
As himself. 

He left 

An overgrown Civilization 

To offer his services, 

Like Lafayette, 

To 

Young America. 
Fortunate that he looked upon 

Naushon 
As a stable place of residence, 

For there all the good 
Little people of the mainland go. 

Also 

Light-weighted Clergymen 

And light-witted Women. 

Hard as the latter are to bear, 

Johnny Crapaud 
Bore them with his native gayety. 

But he loved best 
To trot out the little people ; 

And light Clergymen. 
This he did for nearly thirty years 
Under two beneficent regimes. 

How many 
Pale cheeks and dull eyes he trotted 

Into glow and gladness, 
Whisking his inefficient tail,

Johnny s portrait still adorns the walls at the 
mansion house at Naushon. 

Every hair of which 
Could be numbered without the assistance 

Of Providence : 
It was a tail that might have been 

Told. 

His color was a russet-brown : 
Though he was a little heavy by 

The head, 

His eye twinkled with private reflections 
Which he had the sense never 

To impart. 
Like all persons who have 

Made up their mind, 
He was rather hard to turn ; 

And has been known 
To Carry a Clergyman Contemptuously 

Through the underbrush, 
As if Nature were superior 

To Grace. 

He could open gates 
And thus extend his area of freedom : 

And was not always 

Found in his appropriate pasture : 

Thus singularly sympathizing 

With mankind. 

Of late 
He had become enfeebled ; 

So that when one day 
He attempted to reach his grand 

Climb-act-trick, 

He turned a summerset and 

Went down the hill : 

For his tail 

Was futile to arrest him. 

He has been going down ever since. 

His last ride he gave to 

The little grandson, 

Whose father is at the Country s front. 

To be set upon 

In this way 

Was an honor to a foreign pony : 
And no doubt he felt that his 



110 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

At Milton, on the 15th of November, 1838, my 
twin sisters, Alice and Ellen, were born, and on the 

Crib was full. 

At length 
Sometime in the month of 

August, 1864, 

Though all the gates were shut, 
He disappeared. 

Search 

Was made for him 
In the supposition that feeling his 

End approach 
He went to meet it : 

Thus 
Delicately saving the expenses of 

A burial, 
And adroitly prolonging the period 

Of mourning among those 

Who so often felt themselves 

Above him. 

His friends 

Are all the good little people who 
Have grown up able to 

Recollect 

And appreciate his 

Mute and honest service : 

And at least one 

Clergyman. 

No doubt 

As a happy recognition of 
That service, 

He 

Who had taken so many to ride 
Was at last carried off in 

A Chariot : 

Poached like the patriarch. 
May he find many 

Clergymen 

In the place whither he has gone : 
And innumerable Orthodox children 

To render happy 

Who have hitherto been deemed 

Damned.

20th of December, 1839, I find my father writing 
to his brother in China : 

" With care I hope to see them robust children ; 
yet they are remarkable already for a thousand 
valuable qualities of heart and head ; one ought to 
be named Prodigy and the other Phenomenon! 
They sit at table, stand, almost walk alone, say a 
few words, or something like words, and in fine are 

getting to be very charming I m getting 

quite in love with the dear little souls." 

In 1840 my brother William was born ; and in 
the following spring my parents went to Philadel 
phia to see my mother s brother, William Hatha 
way. He was taken very ill a week after their 
arrival, and my father says in his notes : 

"I had to resume my post as nurse for the 
second time in a smallpox case. This time the 
trial was short and sharp, for in about a fortnight 
we laid his remains in the Laurel Hill cemetery, 
afterwards transferring them to Naushon. He was 
only twenty-eight years old, and was the most 
attractive man I ever came in contact with ; manly, 
handsome, magnetic; he sang well, rode, hunted, 
did everything well, and was the universal favorite 
of all who knew him, men and women. I have 
always felt that if he had lived until the rebellion 

And as he has not remaned, 
May at least 

His tail 
Resume its lost hairs 

Now 
Hairs of glory. 



112 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

he must have played a great part in military life, 
for which he had a marked turn." 

When, years afterwards, my uncle s body was 
removed to Naushon, my father, who had been sud 
denly obliged to take a voyage to England, wrote 
from on board the steamship Canada : 

" I only regret that I could not be with you 
when consigning them to their last resting-place in 
the bright forest which he loved so well, and where, 
if I ever wasted a thought upon the disposition of 
my shell when the spirit has left it, I should choose 
my own to be placed; although I may as well say 
here, that for myself I have no feeling on that sub 
ject and would rather the poor mortal form should 
be forgotten, and only the picture of the inner man, 
lighted by such spirit and such affection as my 
friends could throw around it, remain for their mem- 
ory." 

I have referred to my father s precautions for our 
younger folk at Naushon in the matter of boating. 
He himself speaks as follows of the only boating 
accident in his own experience, which came near 
being a fatal one : 

" Perhaps the nearest I ever came to having to 
swim for my life was in 1842, when Commodore 
Bennet was out on a trial trip with the new 
schooner Ariel, a boat of about 100 tons, destined 
for China. It was a blustering summer day, and 
we soon found she was over-sparred, or under-bal 
lasted, but having a strong crew, including Fowler, 
the Boston pilot, we kept on trying her at some 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 113 

risk, once nearly going over off the Hardings, out 
side of Boston Light, in sixty feet of water or more. 
Coming in through the narrows we had a strong 
head wind with a tide going the other way, which 
tripped her up, and the first thing we knew was 
seeing the sails in the water and the sea pouring 
down the open companion way, filling her. We 
scrambled up on her bilge, and then Fowler called 
out to me to help save the old gentleman who was 
being swept down into the cabin by the rush ; we 
got hold of his collar and pulled him up among us, 
and found it was old Captain Kichard Cleveland 
(perhaps eighty years old), the father of cousin 
Sarah Cleveland s husband, and a cousin of our 
President Cleveland. He was a very plucky old 
man, and had been capsized a little while before on 
Jamaica Pond (besides many other adventures since 
told in a book), and took it very coolly. We had a 
boat towing astern, but by bad luck her painter was 
fastened to leeward and the belaying - pin was 
already under water out of reach. K. B. F., with 
his usual presence of mind, walked out on the main 
boom, got into the boat and began cutting the hard 
painter with a little penknife, sawing away at it as 
our vessel sank. We watched him with eager eyes, 
for our lives depended on its not breaking and on 
its continuing to cut fast enough. I had (as usual) 
a good jackknife, which I opened and held ready in 
my mouth while steadying myself to run or swim 
out to him if his knife gave out ; but he had the 
line out just as the water began to rise over our 



114 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

shoes where we stood on the Ariel s side, still nearly 
dry. He pulled the boat in rapidly by the end of 
the painter, and we all got on board without any 
serious wetting, except Captain Cleveland. The 
captain and crew of the vessel, however, who were 
forward letting go the anchor, got a panic when 
they saw her sinking for fear the whirlpool would 
suck them in, as is the traditional danger of sinking 
ships, so they jumped overboard to escape being 
drowned, while the vessel sank with hardly a ripple 
or a whirl, the whirlpool danger being one of the 
many popular chimeras which annually destroy a 
certain number of valuable lives. Here too came 
in an illustration of the value of coolness in danger. 
When we went over, the yacht Breeze, steered by old 
Captain William Sturgis, was close by us to wind 
ward, with a party of friends. The captain some 
how for once lost his head and did the wrong thing, 
and did not get down to us until we were safe on 
our boat, nor in time to save one of the crew. 
These were rescued by the captain of a fisherman, 
half a mile off when he saw us go over, who jumped 
into the little boat which was towing astern and 
reached us in time to pick up some of them. I was 
glad to find that danger had not paralyzed me, and 
I had made up my mind that as one boat might not 
hold us all, some of us younger ones had only to 
get overboard and hold on to the little boat until 
relief came up. As we sailed up the harbor an 
other yacht, I think Winchester s Northern Light, 
hailed us, and asked if the Ariel was still down 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 115 

the harbor. The commodore, K. B. F., jumped up 
on the taffrail and with a very pregnant gesture, 
pointing to the bottom, said, Yes, very far down ! 
We got ashore and back to our friends on Milton 
Hill without their having seen the accident, it was 
all so quick, although they had been watching us. 
The Ariel was raised, her spars reduced, and she 
went out to China, proving a very safe and fast boat. 
She was modeled, and half owned, by old Joe Lee, 
and was very long for her beam, and very sharp." 

I find that in April, 1843, Daniel Webster, 
then Secretary of State, sent a circular to China 
merchants asking for suggestions from them in 
view of the public mission about to start for China, 
"for the purpose of cultivating friendly relations 
with that empire." My father was deputed to draw 
up the answer which was signed by the merchants 
of Boston engaged in that trade, and sent in due 
course to the proper quarter. This document seems 
to an outsider to cover all possible points, but as it 
runs to a " Seventhly " and " Finally " I refrain 
from giving it here. 

About this time I find my father giving his views 
to a relative in the matter of expenditure by men 
engaged in trade. I think it best to give what he 
wrote, though I have already referred briefly to his 
opinion on the subject : 

" There is one point on which I think I can con 
vince you that you are wrong. 

" You say that where a man is engaged in trade 
there are no means of computing his income, or 



116 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

what amount it would be prudent for him to spend. 
Now I think there is a way of judging the future 
by the past. My trade operations since I began 
business when a boy in Canton, or, if you take a 
fairer test, since I returned from China, in 1837, 
have not averaged over six per cent, interest on the 
amount invested, if you take out the first lucky hit 
of the Acbar by being out during the China war, 
and the very nice tea speculation to England that 
was made for me at the same time. Without these 
two operations I am sure my profits have not been 
over six per cent., and I am inclined to think that 
with them they would not be much over six. And 
yet you and others have thought my adventures 
have been at least as profitable as the average of 
commercial operations; and they have certainly 
been undertaken with some advantages over other 
people in having good friends in China. But the 
truth is that competition is so sharp here that 
money must be made either by the most penurious 
saving in fitting ships or storing goods, etc., etc., or 
by being constantly on the lookout and giving up 
body and soul to managing business. . . . More 
over, it is my firm conviction that for twenty years 
past the average interest gained on the whole capi 
tal engaged in the China trade has not exceeded six 
per cent. 

"Mr. Cabot always said that from 1820 to 1830, 
P. & Co. would have made more money if they had 
put their property out at interest than they did in 
the China trade, and I believe him ; and we can see 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 117 

that since 1830 he cannot have realized much over 
six per cent., taking into view the Levant s bad 
voyage. 

" In short, if you are going to keep in trade, I 
would rather take six per cent, interest on your 
money than the profit you will make. 

" Theoretically, you are right in saying that a 
man in trade has no fixed income, but in practice I 
think you will see from the above data that if he 
calls his income six per cent., and spends it, laying 
by the profits over six per cent, of one or more suc 
cessful years to meet the losses of the bad year, 
which comes in this country every two or three 
years, he will spend as much as is consistent with 
keeping his principal unimpaired." 

My father, after speaking in his notes of the 
imprudence of a merchant, when reckoning on mak 
ing more than six per cent., 1 in the long run, on his 
invested capital, goes on to say : 

" In looking over some old letter books running 
from 1837 to 1846, I note fluctuations in the rate 
of interest, which sometimes for pretty long periods 
ran as high as thirteen per cent, per annum. At 
one time I could not pass Colonel T. H. Perkins s 
six months note, with my indorsement, at a lower 
rate than eighteen per cent, per annum." 

He speaks of some not very good ventures which 
he made at this period (1843-1848) and of his join 
ing in building, under Ericsson s auspices, the steam- 

1 My father s "six per cent." at the period of which he was 
speaking would have to be translated now into four per cent, or less. 



118 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

ship Massachusetts, of about 750 tons, one of the 
first Atlantic steamships ; which proved, however, too 
small for that service and was sold to the United 
States and did good work in the Mexican war. 

Up to this time he had taken no active part in 
politics, but he writes as to this : 

" I see that I spent something in politics, as a 
passive member of the Whig party, until March 7, 
1850, when I left it. Among other similar outlays 
was my contribution to the Webster fund, which 
really was largely influential in preventing Web 
ster s reaching the presidency by putting him in 
the position of a candidate subsidized by rich men. 
Political subscriptions were in those days on a small 
scale and would make a very poor show compared 
with modern ones." 

About this time my father first became interested 
in railroads. I have already given his letter to his 
brother Bennet, stating his opinion of their pro 
spects in the United States at an earlier date. Look 
ing back in 1884, he refers to the gradual growth 
of the American railroad system, up to about 5000 
miles of track in 1846, and then says : 

" My judgment was sound in 1836 when I kept 
out of railroads, but how I came to get in in 1846, 
ten years later, may be worth telling." 

He continues, referring to a relative who, though 
absolutely trustworthy, was not a brilliant man of 
business : 

" I was stupid enough to dream that he might 
earn a salary by being made a figure-head in a rail- 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 119 

road, which I supposed to be a nominal place like 
the presidency of insurance companies, then gen 
erally given to honest and reliable, though unsuc 
cessful, merchants, while the secretaries did the 
work. About the early days of 1846, having this 
absurd idea in my head I was led to take an in 
terest, perhaps a tenth, in buying of the State of 
Michigan its quarter-built road, at seventy cents on 
the dollar, my copartners being John E. Thayer, 
Williams et al., of Boston, John C. Green, George 
Griswold et aL, of New York, Erastus Corning 
and a few others, of Albany, and above all J. 
W. Brooks a young engineer, then in charge of a 
section of the New York Central, I think from 
Utica to Syracuse. Little did I dream of the load 
I was taking when I accepted the office of presi 
dent." 

But he had put his hand to the plough, and after 
that there could be no leaving it in the furrow. In 
his notes he goes on to tell of the wonderful capa 
city of Mr. Brooks, and how under his general 
management this 140 miles of state railroad, " built 
on strap iron and lengthwise timbers, and, though 
still young, nearly worn out then," soon became, 
in spite of the stupidest and fiercest opposition on 
the part of those most to be benefited by it, a 
thoroughly well equipped line, and a model for rail 
road management, which was then throughout the 
country in the crudest possible state. And then, 
speaking of his own and his brother directors ab 
solute unconsciousness of the coming conversion, 



120 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

within a few decades, of a swamp on Lake Michi 
gan into a populous city, he writes (1884) : 

" Like a young bear, with all my troubles before 
me, I had plunged into the railroad vortex, and on 
June the llth, 1847, I find by my letter books that 
I was at Milwaukee with the other Michigan Cen 
tral directors, we having decided to take our road 
around the lake to Chicago, in stead of trusting to 
New Buffalo and water carriage on the lake for our 
western outlet. It was on this trip that W. B. 
Ogden drove us about Chicago and tried to coax us 
into rapid action by offering us land in that city, 
for which he was the selling agent, at low prices. 
The land below the harbor on the lake was then a 
sand drift and might have been bought very low, 
but the cheapest purchases would have been the 
wet prairie lands within a mile of the hotel where 
we stopped, which were offered us at $1.25 per 
acre. Sheltered by our absurd prejudices against 
land we were proof against Ogden s seductions, and 
I do not think any of us ever bought a foot of land 
in Chicago for ourselves while the road was in 
course of construction. My hotel bill of $125 
would have bought 100 acres, now worth $8,000,000 
to $12,000,000." 

The ordinary routine of mercantile and railroad 
interests was now broken in upon by the Irish 
famine, of which he writes in his notes : " In 1847 
came the great Irish famine, the stories about which 
were more pitiful than those of any other such 
calamity, partly, perhaps, because we heard them 



TEN YEARS, OF BUSINESS 121 

so directly from the Irish around us, who them 
selves contributed all they could to relieve their 
relations in the old country;" and tells how the 
idea came to him of borrowing the Jamestown 
from the United States government, how she loaded 
up in Boston, and under the command of his bro 
ther was sent with her cargo to relieve the distress 
in Ireland, and returned to the United States, to 
find another ship, borrowed by New York for the 
same purpose, only half loaded ; to all which I do no 
more than refer, as the history has been given at 
length by my uncle Bennet in his book of " Per 
sonal Reminiscences," already mentioned. 

It must have been soon after the Irish famine 
that my father was requested by one of his New 
York correspondents, a most conservative man, to 
join him in making an advance to an English com 
pany working some iron property at Mount Savage, 
in Maryland, to enable them to complete their blast 
furnaces. This was made, other advances had to 
follow, the English company failed, and the busi 
ness became one of my father s most perplexing 
problems for long afterwards. Within my own 
recollection it was a constant source of irritation to 
him ; he had to be going to Mount Savage at all 
seasons of the year ; and when after many years a 
good man of business was found able and willing 
to take this old man of the sea off his neck there 
was a general family rejoicing. He refers at length 
in his notes to this " episode in my business life," 
as he lightly calls it. Giving an account of one of 



122 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

the journeys taken in the interest of this enterprise, 
he writes : " We made arrangements for getting 
from Mount Savage to Cumberland on a hand car 
in the night. We had a most exciting slide, very 
fast, in the dark, nearly running over dogs, pigs, 
and men, by good luck getting without an accident 
into Cumberland, where I established myself in coat 
and shawl in the baggage car for the night." And 
of another, 

" I was once called up to Mount Savage rather 
late in the fall, and in passing through New York 

I stopped to see the celebrated Dr. , who was 

a crank on the subject of treating diseases of the 
throat with nitrate of silver. After poking his 
probes far down my throat and examining the con 
dition of things, he said, There is nothing for it 
but to cut off both tonsils in your throat. I asked 
how long it would take. Five minutes. I told 
him to go ahead ; whereupon he cut off both tonsils, 
each as big as the end of my finger, and then 
stopped the bleeding with nitrate of silver, and 
packed me off to the train. He had not thought to 
tell me, what I found to be the case, that my throat 
was so tender that I could not get anything down 
for twenty-four hours, so I had to make the journey 
on an empty stomach, after getting through the 
needful business." 

There is nothing else in the history of Mount 
Savage which I think likely to interest or amuse 
the general reader. But, on the other hand, I can 
not refrain from giving the following letters which 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 123 

I have chanced upon, among my father s papers, as 
they present a side of his character his strong 
love of a good practical joke which is not brought 
out in his graver correspondence. The occasion 
which provoked the letters was this. His cousin, 
Dr. Edward Bobbins, of Boston, a man with the 
warmest of hearts, but a patience which had its dis 
tinct limits, had learnt that Mr. Corning, of Albany, 
had a herd of very fine milch cows ; and my father 
had agreed to join him in buying some of these 
animals. Dr. Robbins, however, contrary to my 
father s advice, had insisted on inquiring if there 
were no young unmarried German laborer in the 
neighborhood of Albany whom he could hire per 
manently and who could begin work by fetching on 
the cows. He had deputed my father to make the 
inquiry. This was made, and my father had re 
ceived from New York a genuine letter from a Mr. 
Whitehouse strongly recommending one William 
Reynolds, " a good farming man with a wife and 
four small children." My father had seen at once 
that this did not answer the good doctor s descrip 
tion of what he wanted; but he could not resist 
sending on the letter to him, and writing at its foot, 
" Answered as follows : Send Mr. Reynolds along 
at once with his wife and children. Let them go 
straight to the house of Dr. E. H. Robbins, Summer 
Street, who is in great distress for exactly this 
family. Promptly had come the following screed 
from his cousin : 



124 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

J. M. F., Who the devil is Mr. Whitehouse? 
Write him that there are more women and children 
in these parts than food ; that you have no use for 
such folks. A German emigrant, worth five dollars 
a month, is not a man and wife and five children. 
Mr. Whitehouse be buttered ! E. H. K. 

June 3, 1848. 

Then my father, seeing the way in which the 
genuine letter had been received, gave himself up 
to the joke and concocted the following letter (of 
which there is a rough copy in his own handwrit 
ing), and sent it to some correspondent in Utica to 
copy out, sign with the name " James S. White," 
and post back to himself in Milton : 

UTICA, June 2, 1848. ; 

To MR. JOHN M. FORBES, Milton, Mass. 

Dear Sir, When in Albany Mr. Corning in 
formed me that German labor was in demand in 
Boston, and that you had sent to him for one or 
more men. 

We are overstocked with it here, and thinking it 
doubtful whether Mr. Corning could furnish what 
you want, I have helped and encouraged two or 
three families to return to Boston and have given 
them letters of introduction to you. They cannot 
get over $8 to $10 per month here, and I feel con 
fident from what Mr. Corning said that if you don t 
want them you can easily provide them with places 
at better rates, and that their families can find em- 



TEN YEARS OF BUSINESS 125 

ployment in your factories, which they cannot do 
here. 

When will you make a dividend on the Michigan 
R. R., in July or January ? 

Yours truly, JAMES S. WHITE. 

N. B. I have also furnished a poor Irish family 
named Gallagher with funds to reach Boston. The 
father, who has seen better days, is a good farmer, 
and would make a very trusty and intelligent su 
perintendent, as foreman of a large farm, though 
unable to work himself, owing to an accident to one 
of his arms. His sons are stout lads, and his daugh 
ters are willing to go into service. I have lent 
them $11, and if you employ them I wish you 
would try to get it for me ; also the Mullers $8, 
Eucker $6, and Schmidt $6. 

Yours, J. S. W. 

This, when received from Utica, my father for 
warded to Dr. Robbins, who swallowed it all and 
replied as follows : 

MY DEAR J. M. F., What an infernal set of 
correspondents you have ; I shall be very careful 
how I join you again in any speculation ; the simple 
request to have the German sent with the cows 
ought not to have imposed upon me, or even you, 
the whole German nation, or the surplus Irish popu 
lation of western New York. 

If this is the way Michigan stockholders use you, 
deliver me from such friends ; if any of them do 



126 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

come, I shall immediately enter a complaint to the 
city government (saving always one simple German 
man), to have them seized and taken to Deer Island, 
to be provided for, and Mr. Whitehouse, of New 
York, and Mr. White, of Utica, called upon to re 
spond with suitable bonds to the city against the 
parties becoming paupers to be supported by the 
city ; as for the cattle (the cows) I shall take my 
cow, and deliver yours, promising never again to 
enter into any cattle speculations with you ; there 
is too long a tail to your conduct. 

Yours truly, E. H. E. 

BOSTON, June 5, 1848. 

Then followed a steady stream of letters of re 
commendation, which, as I find from my father s 
indorsement on the bundle of real and fictitious 
documents, gradually brought home to his cousin s 
mind the fact that no crowd of immigrants, German 
or Irish, was on its way to him to be transferred to 
Deer Island. My father notes that the doctor bore 
no malice, and that they continued the best of 
friends. 



CHAPTER VI 

RAILROADS AND OTHER ENTERPRISES. SLAVERY 

THE letter books of this period (1848) show that 
the difficulties of railroad construction, and the 
questions of financial engineering incident to it, 
were taking more and more of my father s time. 

In the midst of this came the discovery of the 
California gold fields, which set everybody crazy. 
He promptly availed himself of the new opening for 
merchandise, and by his advice a relative went out 
to San Francisco and started there as a commission 
merchant. When settled there, he asked my father 
for the benefit of his experience in this business, and 
received the following reply. It seems worth pre 
serving for the same reasons that led me to print 
the instructions to Captain Dumaresq, ten years 
earlier. 

MILTON, June 17, 1849. 

MY DEAR : I will, as you request, touch 

upon some of the important points for a commission 
merchant to aim at. 

First. As to correspondence. Always look back 
to previous letters before sitting down to write; 
then try to give to each constituent a continuation 
of the history of his business, studying as much 



128 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

conciseness as is consistent with exactness and 
method. In quoting prices before actual sales take 
place, be careful not to lead to too great expecta 
tions as to net results. If you name a price on 
arrival and don t get it, they are very apt to com 
plain because you did not sell on arrival. On the 
other hand, if you name too low a price, owners are 
apt to hear other letters quoting higher rates. I 
suggest, therefore, great caution in quoting prices 
except from actual sales, and taking care to make 
at the same time any remarks that are applicable to 
the matter, such as the expense of landing, mea 
suring, weighing, etc., all which will be high ; and 
it will probably be good policy, if custom has not 
too firmly fixed it, to make people pay all these 
charges exactly as they stand you in, so that your 
commission shall be net. Many people would 
grumble at a high nominal commission, who would 
be perfectly satisfied if you charged them a moder 
ate commission and put among charges the actual 
expense to you of handling the goods, even if the 
sum of the charges is higher than in the other case. 
Then instead of employing clerks, you may find 
it good policy to have a weigher, a measurer, a sur 
veyor of lumber, etc. Custom may very likely have 
settled all this. As to market advices, try to give 
actual sales and other facts, and be cautious how 
you give such encouragement as to the future as 
will lead people to think you are urging consign 
ments. Give all the facts you can, and all the cir 
cumstances which bear upon the future : such as the 



RAILROADS AND OTHER ENTERPRISES 129 

tide of emigration, the effect of plentifulness of 
gold in causing free expenditure, the temporary 
overstock which may at the time cause dullness; 
but I would not venture many predictions as to 
future prices, except where you are very sure you 
are right. Give facts, and let those who are to run 
the risk speculate upon them. Of course to me and 
other private friends no such reserve may be needed, 
but I refer to general letters : you thus avoid the 
appearance of extravagance, and induce people to 
rely upon your judgment. 

Second. As to sales and accounts. Always, 
where it is left to you, sell promptly, unless there 
are very strong reasons for holding. Everybody 
who has had foreign business gets disgusted with 
the long delays before they get their returns with 
squared accounts; besides this feeling, there is 
always expense incurred by holding and loss of 
interest, and it takes considerable rise to pay for 
holding goods long. As a general rule, therefore, 
sell early and make prompt returns. Most of those 
who have gone into so wild a trade as that to Cali 
fornia are speculative people and will be glad of 
their money back in good time. Of course, there 
will be great fluctuation in California, and great 
room for judgment about holding, and my own 
impression is that it may be best to hold shiploads 
of goods till the digging season is entirely over and 
the overland emigrants from the Western States 
come down to the coast: sailors and other labor 
will then be more cheap. 



130 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Third. Be very careful how you give one house 
information as to the business of others intrusted 
to you. Even those who like to get such informa 
tion distrust those who give it. Even a sale that 
everybody knows had better be mentioned in gen 
eral terms, rather than especially referred to as " a 
sale made by you of the C. s cargo." When you 
have sold nearly all a consignment, close the rest, 
even at a low price, in order to send promptly the 
sales and proceeds, closed to a point. I have often 
had a letter reach Forbes, Forbes & Co., London, 
with large remittances in sixty-day bills, and have 
received accounts made within twenty-four or forty- 
eight hours, showing the discount of the bills on 
London, the purchase and remittance of bills on 
Bengal, and the whole closed to a cent, and an 
account current returned. This system is beauti 
ful, and any American that can combine this Eng 
lish method and precision with Yankee energy will 
command all the business he can do. Keally good 
commission houses are very rare, and I know of 
only two or three in the world. Mr. William Gary 
I consider as good as any other. The custom as 
to giving credit may be well established before you 
get there, but it will be more or less modified as 
trade increases. There never was such a chance 
for a community to get on without credit, and you 
may rely upon it that the shorter you can make the 
credit, even to having sales made strictly for cash, 
the better for you in the long run. Commission 
houses generally like sales on credit because they 



RAILROADS AND OTHER ENTERPRISES 131 

give them a chance to charge a guarantee commis 
sion, but people will be all the more ready to pay a 
large commission if there is no discount for cash to 
be added to it. Besides this, if you give credit 
where none is needed, as in California, it leads to com 
petition and inflation. Each house gradually, for 
the sake of making sales, will sell on longer credit 
to weaker customers, and the risk of guarantee 
keeps on increasing, while the rate is stationary or 
decreasing as houses multiply. Use all your influ 
ence, therefore, to establish a cash system. Don t 
try to make money out of storage, etc., etc. The 
charges of this sort will be enormous, and you had 
better fortify yourselves against the complaints 
which will follow by charging others what you pay, 
and telling them so. If you undertake to own or 
hire warehouses and make a profit out of them, you 
cannot add much to the enormous prices you will 
have to pay. I should say, therefore : go for mak 
ing all charges on goods as simple and small as pos 
sible, and trust to doing a large business and laying 
the foundation for its long continuance, rather than 
trying to make the most out of what is sent to you 
at first. 

Very truly yours, J. M. F. 

Nota Bene. Always try to keep ahead of your 
work so as never to be obliged to write hastily or 
carelessly, as I too often do. Do as I say, and not 
as I too often do. 

N. B. The great art of making bargains is to 
find out other people s ultimatum without letting 



132 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

out yours, and this can be done with most people 
by letting them talk. 

His relative acted on this advice to some purpose, 
and I am glad to say with successful results. 

It was at this time that my father built and 
sailed those clipper ships to which he referred as 
by comparison reducing the fast ships of an earlier 
day to " clumps." They earned for a time $40 a 
ton freight for the passage round the Horn to San 
Francisco. So every inch was of value, and after 
the sailing of one of them my father speaks of his 
having been " laid up some days at Naushon with 
leeches on his head," and adds, " My wife always 
calls it my box fever, as my mind was running on 
finding small boxes to fill up the chinks under the 
ship s decks." 

As to this California trade, I find a letter of my 
father s, dated January 4, 1850, to the Hon. Dan 
iel Webster, complaining of the dog in the manger 
inaction of the postal authorities, who would neither 
themselves carry promptly the mercantile corre 
spondence on which the fate of many million dollars 
worth of merchandise depended, nor any longer 
allow the express companies to do the work. The 
letter inclosed memorials on the subject to each 
house of Congress. 

In 1852, during the discussions that preceded the 
memorable expedition of Commodore Perry to Japan, 
my father writes, under date of the 28th of Febru 
ary, to Mr. William Appleton, a member of Congress : 



RAILROADS AND OTHER ENTERPRISES 133 

" The newspapers reiterate the charge that our 
government are fitting out a fleet to coerce the 
Japanese into commercial intercourse. . . . The 
course of these Japanese expeditions is a stereotyped 
one. The ships of war appear, and the local man 
darins are made responsible for driving them off; 
and, failing to persuade them to go, the poor 
wretches draw a knife across their throats or go 
to the executioner; and this tragedy is repeated 
until the foreigners see the impossibility of gaining 
either glory or trade, and withdraw after getting, 
without pay, all the supplies which the land af 
fords. 

" If we have shipwrecked sailors in captivity, then 
one or two vessels of war can accomplish all that is 
to be done, viz., make their demands and get any 
men given up that are there, and can make the 
government and the mandarins fully aware of the 
trouble they bring upon themselves by keeping our 
people prisoners in future ; but as to forcing a com 
mercial intercourse, I do not believe any man of 
sense who has been in China will admit the proba 
bility of accomplishing anything without pretty 
much such a war as John Bull got up with China. 

" A smaller force may butcher thousands of men 
in petticoats and sink their arks, and the officers 
may call their Chinese junks men of war and sing 
pseans over their glorious victory, but the glory 
will be all the Navy will get except fresh beef and 
vegetables ; and the conservative Whig government 
will have the discredit of an unsuccessful interven- 



134 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

tion in the affairs of a people whom even John Bull 
has been ashamed to attack." 

In the early spring of this same year (1852) my 
father took his first trip to Florida for the benefit 
of his health. He wrote to my brother from Enter 
prise, under date of March 26 : 

MY DEAR WILLIE, It is now your turn to have 
a line ; but as I have been pacing the sandy beach 
by the light of the moon and stars until 10.30 p. M., 
you must be content with a scratch. The night is 
a lovely one a light breeze over the lake, but 
hardly enough to make a wavelet on the shore; 
thermometer 60 to 70; sky and stars like those of 
the tropics, and all the elasticity, too, of the sea 
air ; for we are only about eighteen miles from the 
Atlantic. 

This afternoon, after dinner, we took my sail 
boat, the Mary, and with a gentle breeze sailed 
over to Fort Mellen to see the Indian captives 
brought in by General Hopkins and his scouting 
party. We found them all assembled in a large 
rough room, and quite a scene it was ! First, there 
was a poor suffering young woman who had been 
shot with seven buckshot on the thigh, and the 
bone broken : she lay in the midst on a rude litter, 
upon which she had been brought 120 miles through 
swamps and bushes between two ponies ; she showed 
no signs of pain, and hardly appeared to observe 
anything. Then a family of a mother and five 
children, from one and a half years to twelve the 



RAILROADS AND OTHER ENTERPRISES 135 

three youngest, bright-eyed little imps, entirely bare 
except a cotton handkerchief tied around the neck 
and hanging behind quite an original way of 
clothing a youngster. Then one or two other 
women, and two or three older children about thir 
teen to fifteen ; and finally a warrior lying in a cor 
ner, with a rope around his neck, which was held 
by a sentinel with a loaded gun in his hand his 
legs and feet were bare to the thighs. The elder 
ones looked dull and rather stupid; the children 
bright and happy. They were caught, a week ago 
to-night, out of their boundary ; made prisoners on 
charge of being cattle stealers; but whether they 
are outlaw Indians, who do not acknowledge Billy 
Bowlegs, or whether they are a party of the Sem- 
inole nation, is the question. If the latter, we may 
have the whole tribe down upon the settlements for 
vengeance; but I hope these are certain outlaws 
whom Billy would like to have us catch and send 
West. The most singular part of the whole was 
the troop of undisciplined volunteer woodmen who 
brought them in amongst whom one or two were 
sober the major was lying drunk on the floor ! 
I was introduced to General Hopkins, a rough 
farmer-looking man, who might remind one a little 
of Peter Blake, 1 also a Captain Jarnegan, who is at 
the bottom of all the trouble, having taken two 
prisoners a month or more ago, one of whom, a 
woman, hung herself. He was a rough-looking 
man, who is said to be the best Indian hunter 

1 The family fishman at Milton. 



136 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

in Florida, and is, I fear, a mischievous fellow. 
He tells me it means war, and that these are Bow- 
leg Indians. It may lead to war, but I think it 
is his fault. The rest of the troop were a hard- 
looking, hard-drinking set, and the horses, having 
had no corn for a week, looked almost starved. 
The men obeyed no orders, and were swearing and 
drinking and almost fighting. The steamboat was 
at anchor waiting for them, and after seeing enough 
of the Indians and playing with the children and 
giving them some small change, I prepared to start, 
when General Hopkins asked me to take his Indians 
on board the steamer ; so I took my man Pablo, 
and took the whole eleven or twelve on board. It 
was lucky I was there with my roomy boat, as the 
poor woman would have suffered in a canoe, and as 
it was, she groaned dreadfully as they laid her 
down, and looked wistfully at the water. If you 
could have been magnetized to see me with my 
cargo, and pouring water into the mouth of the 
wounded woman, you would have thought of R. 
Crusoe and his Island. 

I got them safely on board the steamer, and then 
got my party and made sail for home, taking a 
little cruise to enjoy the beautiful sunset and the 
delicious warm breeze. It was one of those soft 
sunsets, with long feathering pink and crimson 
clouds, such as is seldom seen out of the tropics. 
It was eight before we got home, and now the mos 
quitoes are killing me, so good-night. Dr. Bryant 
thinks the woman will die. 



RAILROADS AND OTHER ENTERPRISES 137 

28th March. 

One of our invalids died on Friday, and the other 
is just going now, and both bodies are to go up 
with us in the steamer ! 

Yesterday we took another sail up river, and I 
hit three alligators and killed one ; they were lying 
out on the banks and swimming round with their 
heads out of water, just as you see frogs in a pond. 

Tuesday we caught a chameleon of a beautiful 
light green, but he soon changed to a dull brown. 
Dr. Wyman 1 has him in spirits: he also has my 
alligator all dissected, and means to have him set 
up at full length in Cambridge. 

Yesterday Mr. Schley came in from his camp, 
having killed six deer; the Indian troubles scare 
the folks here, and so he gives up hunting for this 
year, and my chance for a deer hunt is done. Mr. 
Schley has been living out in a tent most of the 
time for three months, with only one blanket. 

My father recalls no notable event in his mer 
cantile life during the years immediately succeeding 
this first trip to Florida, except, perhaps, his joining 
Messrs. John and Loring Cunningham in sending 
the clipper ship Flying Childers to Cronstadt, 
whence she brought away " the last cargo of Rus 
sian goods before the blockade was established by 
the English and French at the time of the Crimean 
War," and thereby made quite a profitable trip. 

Captain White, who commanded her, told on his 

1 Professor Jeffries Wyman, of Harvard University. 



138 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

return a good story of the gallant but rather bom 
bastic admiral in command of the blockading squad 
ron, who had hailed him as he ran out, and wished 
to know what there was to prevent his " slapping 
down " with a dozen English frigates into Cron- 
stadt ? " Well/ the captain had replied, " you can 
slap them down easy enough, but whether you 
can slap them back again is a question." And he 
used to add, with a dry chuckle, " The admiral did 
not try it." 

My father speaks of his having been at this time 
" undoubtedly very busy with the Michigan Central 
Railroad, and also with the small roads which then 
formed the embryo of the Chicago, Burlington and 
Quincy," and goes on to tell of his " very trying en 
terprise of building the Hannibal and St. Joseph road, 
to connect the Mississippi and Missouri rivers." 

In 1855 he took his first trip to England, partly 
on business and partly for pleasure. He writes to 
my brothers William and Malcolm : 

BRUNSWICK HOTEL, Jermyn Street, London, May 17, 1855. 
Chilly northeast storm, but trying to clear up. I 
brought my story up to Liverpool in a letter to the 
girls. Such confusion on board! Anchored in the 
river. The tide rises so much that vessels cannot 
stay at the wharf, so they have built immense stone 
basins with gates towards the river. When tide is 
high, open come the gates, and ships pass in and 
out ; then, being shut up, the docks remain full of 
water and the ships far above the river. Common 



RAILROADS AND OTHER ENTERPRISES 139 

tides rise seventeen feet. Well, you never saw such 
confusion ; 200 passengers, each about four trunks 
800, and two custom-house officers to examine 
all in a little crowded place on deck. After several 
hours, got my trunks passed, and E. C. his, and we 
went on board boat to go ashore. Remembered 
a forlorn woman on the steamer with a small child, 
a little like our Sarah ; my conscience smote me for 
not having helped her, so I told E. C. I would meet 
him on shore, went back to the Pacific, found her 
sitting in the same cold place with her child, wait 
ing for her turn ; got a description of her trunks, 
etc., and went on deck and hunted them up, lugged 
them down myself, and put her and her things in 
charge of the officer, and as she could take care of 
herself thenceforward, rushed back to the boat just 
in time to rejoin C. ; felt not a little relieved. 
Landed in the moist chilly atmosphere. Drove to 
hotel, leaving our baggage to follow with the crowd. 
Ordered dinner for two ; fat landlady, waiter in 
gloves. Presently a plated dish and cover, larger 
than you ever saw, was put before us, and under it 
about half an ox. Ordered a Hansom cab, and 
what s more got into one. We drove furiously 
along the streets, and everybody stared. I thought 
it must be the only one in Liverpool. Imagine a 
red bodied-chaise, with driver perched up behind 
and overhead, reins passing above our heads, a 
lanky horse, and we going like mad Drove about 
town (Sunday), and then out to Greenbank; did 
not stop ; saw some rather pretty houses, but they 



140 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

have prison-looking brick walls, and everything here 
(and indeed all over England) looks and is damp. 
Home at nine P. M.; baggage not come, but just 
before train started, at 9.20, got it, and embarked 
for Birmingham ; carriages instead of cars ; landed 
at 1.20 A. M. ; fine hotel. Up at seven A. M. ; drove 
out to a gunsmith s, William Greener, to make my 
self a present of a gun ; back in time for train at 
nine o clock. Eailroad one hour, and then took a 
fly, so called because it does n t fly, being a heavy 
closed carry-all ; hired it for the day, and started for 
Warwick Castle, one of the old feudal castles, built 
800 or 1000 years ago. Eight hundred years ! 
and no finer building made yet. Has man improved 
much in that time ? I hope so. ... 

It was a fine sunny day, though chilly and with 
passing clouds. Took train at Leamington at six, 
for London. Tuesday, drove to Baring s. The 
city seems like Boston twenty times bigger and 
with a river through it, and with lots of old palaces 
and churches sprinkled about; the common houses 
and streets much like Boston, crooked and up and 
down hill, crowded, all of the streets like Washing 
ton Street on a busy day. Found Mr. Ashburner 
and Beckwith, who took us to see Windsor Castle 
and Park, and a fine old country place, "Gilwood; " 
a lawn with good trees and a park. Windsor Park 
was made by the Norman kings, who destroyed two 
thousand villages to make hunting grounds sixteen 
miles across ; now open to the public for drives and 
walks. Lot of poor, wet, tame-looking deer like 



SLAVERY 141 

uncomfortable sheep, smaller than our deer and 
tamer than Naushon sheep. 

We took at the station an open carriage with a 
postilion in tights and spurs ; home by rail, and 
dined at Mr. Ashburner s club. Home, the spirit 
ualist, here, and is engaged days ahead with the 
fashionable people, who have got hold of him 
through the Lawrences. 

Second day in London. . . . Went to House of 
Commons. You enter a fine old hall built by Wil 
liam the Conqueror, lofty and gothic. The new 
houses are not much, and the members, with their 
hats on, look ordinary enough ; the speaker and 
clerk sat in their wigs ; stayed five minutes. The 
wealth and magnificence of London is incalculable, 
but this climate is perfectly intolerable, raining 
every five minutes, and chilly and cold. Read 
" Bleak House : " the opening account of Lady 
Deadlock and the country seat seems like a descrip 
tion of all the weather here. On Wednesday, Mr. 
Edward Baring takes us to the great Derby race, 
fifteen miles off. He offered to take us in his mo 
ther s carriage. We take a hamper of provisions 
and sit all day ; see Dickens s description of the Fat 
Boy. And now, darlings, with love to all, I must 
say good-by. 

While in England my father must have made the 
personal acquaintance of Nassau Senior, the polit 
ical economist and drafter of the modern English 
poor-law, formerly Professor of Political Economy 



142 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

at Oxford, with whom he had already been in busi 
ness correspondence for some years. They had 
some discussions on the burning question of the 
day, as is clear from the letter which follows. It 
is curious to note how little the nearness of the 
coming storm was realized, though the hand of 
the writer was pretty carefully held on the public 
pulse. He at least felt as Lowell afterwards said : 

" Ef you want peace, the thing you ve gut to du 
Is jes to show you re up to fightin tu." 

TO NASSAU WILLIAM SENIOK. 

STEAMSHIP AMERICA, July 3, 1855. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have read your article in the 
" Edinburgh " with much interest, and stiU more 
with astonishment at your intimate acquaintance 
with American affairs. . . 

There is one error or misconception into which 
you have fallen in regard to the existing opposition 
to the Fugitive Slave Law, and especially to the 
excitement in Boston last year upon the surrender 
of Burns. You ascribe it all to Mrs. Stowe s book, 
and in this you do injustice to the progress which 
sound opinions had made, even in the conservative 
portions of the North, before her book appeared. 

It is notorious that after Webster made his 7th 
March, 1850, speech, which carried the Fugitive 
Bill and its kindred measures, he would not have 
had the vote of one third of his own party for any 
office in the gift of the people of his adopted State, 
Massachusetts. Immediately after the passage of 



SLAVERY 143 

the Bill I was present at the following conversation 
between a Southerner and a conservative Boston 
merchant : 

Southerner. "Now, my friend, we shall have 
quiet ! The South has got her rights,, and there is 
an end of agitation." 

Northern Merch*. " You are all wrong. Agita 
tion has only begun, unless your people avoid exer 
cising their rights and use them simply as a bug 
bear to keep their slaves at home ; for the new law 
will never be enforced except at such cost that it will 
be far cheaper for the master to let his slaves run." 

Southerner. " Then the Union is dissolved. The 
law must be executed in good faith and made to 
work practically, or we leave you." 

Northerner. " Good-by, then ! the sooner you set 
your house in order the better, for our people will 
never allow that law to be executed except in iso 
lated cases ! " 

The above, I am sure, gives a correct view of the 
opinions of those who know the state of public feel 
ing at the North, and the result had been in 
accordance with those opinions even before Mrs. 
Stowe s book appeared. Even those at the North 
who approved of the law expected to see it merely 
held in terrorem over the blacks, as a preventive 
of escape. . . . 

True the book of Mrs. Stowe had been stimu 
lating the masses throughout the country, but the 
Nebraska iniquity, just then perpetrated, took away 
the balance-wheel which had existed, and was the 



144 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

immediate cause of the tremendous excitement which 
pervaded the usually quiet town of Boston on 2d 
June, 1854. . . . 

In looking over my files of American papers I see 
that Massachusetts has passed a bill " for the pro 
tection of personal liberty/ which it is supposed will 
render the Fugitive Bill entirely nugatory within 
her borders. It is much criticised by the conserva 
tive press as radical and dangerous, but I have not 
the least fear of any mischief coming from it ; if it 
really goes too far, our people will correct it in time 
to avoid revolution. I have not seen it, but will get 
it and send it to you herewith. . . . 

The real danger will come, if ever, when the 
North, strong and growing, shall wake up to find 
itself bound through corruption and fraud to the 
will of the aristocratic minority. Then the North 
may insist upon being put back where they were, 
even at the cost of revolution. The Southern poli 
ticians have undoubtedly been aiming at securing 
enough new slave States to give them a majority in 
the Senate, which would then become practically a 
House of Lords, with a veto on all legislation and 
with a claim to a large share of the patronage of 
government. 

Apart from the moral question, and on the mere 
lower ground of expediency and statesmanship, can 
there be a doubt in any sane mind that the safety 
of the North and of the Union consists in a firm 
resistance to the further extension of slavery or the 
increase of slave States beyond what the Constitu 
tion in its strictest, clearest sense calls for ? 



SLAVERY 145 

Early in the fall of 1855 the Barings (acting, as 
it seemed, for Louis Napoleon, though this was 
never acknowledged) began to feel the way towards 
the purchases of wheat and flour which later in 
the year were undertaken for their account by J. M. 
Forbes & Co. This appears from the following 
letter of September 22, 1855, from my father to 
his cousin, Mr. Kussell Sturgis, who was then a 
partner in Baring Bros. & Co. 

MY DEAR STURGIS, ... I notice that you are 
somewhat disturbed at the idea of buying our bread- 
stuffs at high prices, but it is an ill wind that blows 
nobody good, and it will stimulate us here. I only 
hope you will not send us large amounts of stocks 
to sell. . . . Our crops are but just coming to mar 
ket and have hardly begun to have their effect on 
commerce. Upon our Michigan Central road, for 
instance, the receipts of wheat and flour are far 
behind last year, while our receipts generally are 
twenty-five to thirty per cent, additional. This is 
partly owing to the wet weather at the harvest, 
making much of the Michigan wheat unsafe to 
grind or ship until very thoroughly dry, and the 
lakes and canal will probably close with very large 
supplies of grain left in the country, although from 
this time forward all the avenues of transportation 
will be fully occupied. There are various ridicu 
lous stories about the governments of Europe send 
ing here to buy bread. If the French government 
really wanted to help fill the bellies of their people, 



146 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

they could do it easier than by buying wheat. Let 
them employ Philippe s head cook to make Johnny- 
cakes fashionable and palatable, and to mix about 
the same proportion of Indian meal with their 
wheaten bread that we often do here from pre 
ference ; open public bakeries and confectioneries 
on this plan in the principal cities, and instead of 
flour or wheat, import Indian and other cheaper 
meals to eke out the French wheat crop. If the 
French nation could be taught to eat from economy 
as large a proportion of Indian meal as my family 
eat from choice and for health, millions of dollars 
might be saved and lots of hungry bellies filled. 
As it is, I suppose we must put up flour here, and 
thus force our own people to eat our own coarse 
grains ; and in this way I believe we can keep 
you all comfortable until next harvest brings you 
round. . . . Always yours, 

J. M. F. 

My father, referring to the transaction which fol 
lowed, says : " Prices were still low here, but it re 
quired good management to conceal the ownership 
of the breadstuffs and to give the operations the 
appearance of private commercial speculations. . . . 
Our secret was so well kept that nobody dreamed 
of any government being behind us, and some of 
the agents we employed to buy suffered very seri 
ously by going on buying on their own account 
after our order stopped." Writing in 1884 of this 
transaction, and without reference to his books, he 



SLAVERY 147 

says that the purchases of provisions may have 
amounted to considerably over $5,000,000, and that 
this fact and the shipment of the whole of them to 
France left no doubt in his mind that they were 
for the French government ; and he adds : " I am 
not sure whether the operation proved a good one 
for the emperor, but it certainly helped to tide over 
the danger of a hard famine in France." 

It was in order to get through the extra work 
thus caused that he took into his office Charles 
Russell Lowell, of whom more will be seen later on. 
At their first interview in New York he was strongly 
attracted to him, and, as will be seen, the attrac 
tion continued and increased till the day of Lowell s 
death. 

In March, 1856, the press of work caused by the 
shipments of breadstuffs having abated, my father 
was about to take a trip to Florida and Cuba with 
my brother Malcolm, then a small boy. Finding 
that Lowell s doctor wished him to go abroad for 
his health, he proposed that he should join them, 
and they made the trip together, Lowell going 
afterwards in a sailing ship to Europe from New 
Orleans. They visited the " Carolina " sugar plan 
tation near Cienfuegos in Cuba, the picture of 
which, though it was a humane plantation, with the 
whip seldom used, was always a very painful one, 
as it rose in my father s mind in after years. It 
was on his return through South Carolina from this 
trip that he made the acquaintance of Mr. Hamilton 
Cowper, having first heard of him from the lady of 



148 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

a house in which he had been staying, who had 
been rescued years before, with her daughter, then 
a baby, by Mr. Cowper at great risk to himself, 
from the wreck of the steamer Pulaski. This gal 
lantry naturally inclined my father to make friends 
with him, and the pleasant relations then estab 
lished continued after his return home. 

During the political campaign of the following 
autumn (1856), which ended in the election of 
Buchanan to the presidency, my father wrote to Mr. 
Cowper, with the pretext of asking his opinion as 
to the possible employment of Chinese in Florida, 
but chiefly, as he says in his notes, " with the view 
of learning whether the all-absorbing question of 
the day was still so far short of being a burning 
one as to admit of two men of the North and South 
respectively, conservative and presumably patriotic, 
approaching the subject with cool minds and arriv 
ing at some practicable compromise which might be 
recommended to their friends on either side." 

To this letter, he received just after the election, 
the following reply : 

J. HAMILTON COWPER TO J. M. FORBES. 

NEAR DARIEN, November 6, 1856. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter of September 18 
reached my residence soon after my departure on a 
visit to the up country, which will, I hope, be a 
sufficient explanation of the long delay in my an 
swer to it. 

I have read and considered attentively the scheme 



SLAVERY 149 

of your Chinese correspondent to establish a colony 
of laborers from that country in Florida. My pre 
sent impressions are that it is not feasible. I am 
not sufficiently informed as to the amount of work 
that the Chinese are capable of performing to en 
able me to compare the result of their labor with 
that of the negro slave ; but I suspect, with the 
disadvantages of enhanced wages, and the absence 
of compulsory labor, that the balance will be in 
favor of negro labor. In employing a large num 
ber of Irish and negroes on the Brunswick Canal, 
I obtained more work from the latter than the 
former, at a much smaller cost. I know too little 
of the laws of Florida to say whether the introduc 
tion of free Chinese would in any respect be an in 
fraction of them ; but I believe it would not, and I 
believe also that a strong prejudice would be created 
against such a colony. Enlightened patriotism will 
revolt at the introduction of an inferior race of free 
men ; and local prejudice will suspect an attempt to 
attack the institution of slavery. The success of 
such an enterprise will depend on keeping the col 
onists together, and at low wages. In a country 
like this, in which labor is in demand and well paid, 
this will I think be impossible. Contracts for a 
term of time may be made, but they would not be 
respected or enforced. The intelligent and useful 
will soon abandon the colony in search of higher 
wages and a more independent position ; and the 
enterprise will be left to drag on with the drones. 
Many years ago, W. Trumbull brought over a col- 



150 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

ony of Minorcans to Smyrna (south of St. Augus 
tine), the members of which were indented for a 
term of service. The establishment was soon broken 
up in consequence of the infidelity of the laborers 
to their contracts. 

I thank you for the communication of Cecil on 
the exciting question of the day. It is written 
with great elegance and ability, and he enforces 
with great strength his own views. I demur to 
two of his positions, which demurrer, if sound, is 
fatal to his conclusions. First, I deny that Con 
gress has any constitutional right to say to a future 
sovereign State that it shall be curtailed of a power 
possessed by other States, viz. : to decide for itself 
whether it shall or shall not establish slavery. The 
union of the States is of equals and not of inferiors. 
I deny the power of Congress to exclude a part of 
the Union from equal participation in common pro 
perty. Secondly, I deny that a majority has a right 
to govern irrespective of the Constitution, and of 
the rights secured by the great principles of justice. 
An ex part e assertion of constitutional right is no 
ground for the enforcement of majority prejudices. 
This subject is a delicate one for discussion between 
the North and the South, and I usually avoid it as 
unprofitable. There is one practical view which 
should be clearly presented to the whole country, 
which is, the unavoidable result of any attempt to 
enforce the Northern views on the subject of the 
exclusion of slavery from the Territories. Be 
assured, my dear sir, that a dissolution of the Union 



SLAVERY 151 

is inevitable whenever the free-soil principles of the 
North shall in any instance be enforced. If that 
principle be dearer to the North than the Union, 
let it avail itself of its numerical superiority and 
enforce it; but let it not deceive itself into the 
belief that any fear of consequences will deter the 
Southern States from meeting the issue. I love 
the Union, and rank among the conservatives of the 
South, but I am prepared for a dissolution of our 
government rather than yield a right which is 
essential to the very existence of the South. The 
result of the recent election of president is unknown 
to me. If in favor of Mr. Buchanan, I shall breathe 
more freely, as Mr. Fremont s success will, I appre 
hend, be the knell of the Union. I rejoice that 
sectional feelings have still no influence in private 
relations, and that I still hold my Northern friends 
with the feelings of respect with which I am, 
Yours most truly, 

J. HAMILTON COWPER. 

This letter must have convinced my father that it 
was impossible for his correspondent and himself to 
arrive at any point near an agreement on the vexed 
question, and his reply which follows could only 
have been written with the view of showing clearly 
and once for all the standpoint of the North and 
West, from which no bullying or cajoling could 
make them budge, viz. : that slavery had at least to 
be content with what it had got in the way of ter 
ritory, and must not " ask for more." 



152 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

J. M. FORBES TO J. HAMILTON COWPER. 
(Private.) BOSTON, December 4, 1856. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 6th ulto. 
reached me in due course and I am much obliged 
for your valuable information and suggestions in 
regard to Chinese labor in Florida, which will prob 
ably nip that scheme in the bud or reduce it to a 
very safe experiment. 

I thank you too for your frankness in regard to 
the great question of the day. You say truly that 
it is too delicate for profitable discussion among 
friends, but this makes it only the more important 
that the real state of public opinion, outside of 
partisan politics, should be better known than it is. 

I had supposed that there existed a party of great 
latent strength at the South who value the Union 
much more than they do the extension of the insti 
tution of slavery, and who would put forth their 
strength whenever any real danger came. Knowing 
how far you are above being influenced by any 
desire for office, or for any popular extravagance, I 
take it as the very worst indication of the coming 
storm to find that you are not on that side of the 
question. Regretting deeply that it is so, I thank 
you for the warning, which coming on top of the 
election of Mr. Buchanan assures me that we are 
doomed to continued agitation until I860, and then 
to the first real experiment of the strength of our 
confederacy. You have thrown a gloomy shadow 
over the hopes I had entertained of help for the 



SLAVERY 153 

Union from the conservatism of the South ; but it 
is far better to know the truth, and I owe it to you 
in return to tell you what seems to me the state of 
public opinion here. Upon the only real point of 
difference suggested by you, which indeed is the 
only real issue between the North and South, viz. : 
the constitutionality of the principle of the Jefferson 
Proviso, there is hardly any division of opinion 
at the North excepting among the partisans of 
squatter sovereignty; and the experience in Kan 
sas has, I think, reduced the advocates of this doc 
trine to a small minority. We are then all united 
here in the opinion that either Congress or the 
squatters (some looking to one and some to the 
other) have a clear right to prohibit slavery in the 
territories from the moment that settlement begins. 
We have been brought up in the faith that this was 
settled constitutional doctrine, held as it has been 
by all the men we are accustomed to look upon as 
great authorities at the North, and by many of 
your own best men, and confirmed too by the adop 
tion of the Ordinance of 1787, at the very time 
when the Constitutional Convention was in session, 
as also by the adoption of the Missouri compromise 
when Mr. Calhoun was a member of the Cabinet. 

But it is not my purpose to argue. I only mean 
to state the almost universal conviction at the North 
that the restriction of slavery is as clearly within 
the constitutional rights of the majority as any of 
our admitted and daily exercised rights ; and the 
only real difference of opinion here is as to the 



154 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

expediency of exercising that right. Mr. Webster, 
with a respectable body of Whigs and a large body 
of Democrats, was, in 1850, against exercising that 
right unnecessarily ; but it is a very solemn convic 
tion that there is, as nearly as possible, unanimity 
here, since the repeal of the Missouri compromise, 
in favor of exercising that (real or supposed) right 
at all hazards whenever practically necessary to pre 
vent the extension of slavery into territories now 
free. 

Beyond and above all this, the conviction is being 
daily forced upon the North that the designs of the 
South do not stop with introducing slavery into our 
own territories, but that the question to be settled 
in Kansas is whether the whole power of the con 
federacy shall be exercised for buying or conquer 
ing all the territory and islands north of Panama 
for the mere extension of your institution. Some 
of your more bold and ultra men plainly avow 
this intention so far as Cuba, Mexico, and Central 
America are concerned; and the Cincinnati plat 
form is certainly so framed as to warrant this appre 
hension on the part of the North. 

Mr. Buchanan, if aided by the conservative men 
of the South, may allay the apprehension that the 
South seek anything more than the assertion of 
their (supposed or real) right to take their slaves 
into our own territories, but even if he does succeed 
thus far, it is my belief that the issue has been so 
sharply defined to be a struggle for political power 
between the North and South, that it is too late to 



SLAVERY 155 

change it until one or the other side yield, or until 
we separate and begin again on a new basis. I 
believe that the public mind in the non-slavehold- 
ing States has been in a state of revolution for some 
years, but of active change since the passage of the 
Nebraska Bill, and that the change will go on dur 
ing the next four years in a progressive ratio, until 
in 1860 there will be not the ghost of a chance for 
any man s getting an electoral vote in the North 
and West who is not sharply opposed to the exten 
sion of slavery at home and abroad ; and, moreover, 
that it will take all the strength of the moderate 
men of the North to draw the line there to keep 
within the Kepublican platform of 1856. 

It is hard for you to appreciate justly our position 
here without knowing more of the parties who rule 
the North than you can know through the expres 
sion given us by the press, the pulpit, and the ros 
trum. 

I will try to sketch the elements that now move 
the Northern mind. The abolitionists 1 have never 
had much direct influence, and they have been los 
ing ground for several years ; they may be thrown 
entirely out of account. The conservative men of 
both political parties have hitherto believed that 
they could occupy a common ground with those 
of the South in advocating the policy of letting 
slavery alone where it existed, and still retain their 

1 This refers to their power as a separate organization. My 
father, as has been seen, though opposed to their extreme views as 
to the destruction of the Union, was yet much influenced by them. 
ED. 



156 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

proper influence with the masses ; but the issue at 
last made of slavery extension leaves them no choice 
between opposition to it and political annihilation. 
They have very extensively joined the Fremont 
party, and unless the issue can be changed they 
must continue to go there, until the remainder who 
take the Southern side becomes so small as just con 
veniently to fill the federal offices and the easy- 
chairs of their drawing-rooms and clubs. But it is 
the masses, the democracy (call it by what name 
we may), which must rule ; and they are hopelessly 
against the Southern policy, whether it be called 
the extension of slavery, or the establishment of a 
balance of power between the two sections. 

Buchanan owes his Northern success to the Fill- 
more diversion, and to the name of Democrat which 
in certain slow-moving regions, like parts of Penn 
sylvania, still retained its power, under the repre 
sentations of his partisans that he was for popular 
sovereignty (squatter) and for free Kansas. But, 
my dear sir, depend upon it the Northern demo 
cracy can never again be depended upon for a 
Southern alliance. Fifteen or twenty years ago the 
abolition men and women were mobbed everywhere, 
and their lives endangered and their halls burned ; 
now the mob are all the other way, but it is not 
that they have become abolitionists. The wrong of 
slavery preached to them from the pulpit, the waste 
and inexpediency of slavery reiterated to them by 
the press, doubtless weigh with the masses, but all 
other influences sink into insignificance compared 



SLAVERY 157 

with that brought to bear for two years past, and 
especially during the past four months from the 
stump and by the tremendous machinery of the cam 
paign press, to convince the laboring classes here of 
the aristocratic nature of the institution of slavery ; 
of the small number of slaveholders compared with 
the white population North and South, and of the 
coming issue being whether this small class (sup 
posed to rule the South) shall own half the Senate 
and shall use the national arm to extend their in 
stitution at home and abroad. 

So long as there is a pretext, a color, for holding 
up to the people such an issue, there can be but 
one result. 

The masses in all countries can be roused upon 
two points, their nation s interests and their own 
prejudices ; and if there is anything in this coun 
try fixed, it is the prejudice against aught which 
has the appearance even of aristocracy. Are you 
entirely free from danger from this prejudice at 
home? 

Unless then some strange and almost impossible 
change takes place in Mr. Buchanan s policy from 
that of his predecessor, you may count upon the 
popular vote of 1860 being against the increase of 
Southern power with as much certainty as you 
could upon its being thrown against the reestablish- 
ment in our territories of the feudal institutions of 
the Middle Ages. I have said far more than I in 
tended, but I have not that power of condensation 
which you so happily possess. 



158 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

I cordially respond to your hope that difference 

of opinion as to public policy may never interfere 

with friendly private relations between individuals 

of the North and South, and am with great respect, 

Yours very truly, J. M. FORBES. 

P. S. In reading over what I have hastily writ 
ten I see that I have omitted to explain what I 
mean by the danger from Mr. Buchanan s election. 
Any attempt on his part to- strengthen the South 
immediately or prospectively in the Senate, by for 
eign acquisitions of territory or otherwise, will only 
precipitate the crisis and increase the- agitation. 
The only hope of safety for the Union seems to me 
to be for the South now, when they apparently have 
the power through their own President, and can do 
so without sacrifice of their pride, to recede from 
their position in regard to slavery extension, and 
from their struggle for that fatal chimera "the 
balance of power." Let it give up this, and by its 
compact union it will always have more than its fair 
share of the government ; then by taking ground 
on which the conservatives of the North can stand 
with them (and still retain their due influence at 
home), the true interests of the whole country may 
be secured by putting down radical and dangerous 
experiments in government, and by avoiding those 
foreign wars which our turbulent spirits, North and 
South, will always be only too ready to engage in 
against the despotisms of the Old World. 

Yours truly, J. M. F. 



SLAVERY 159 

To turn now from politics to home matters. It 
may be remembered that some years previous to 
this winter (1856-57) my father had joined my 
mother s uncle, Mr. Swain, in buying the island of 
Naushon, Mr. Swain assuming the duties of host, 
or as it was jokingly called, " governor," of the 
island, and my parents spending a month of their 
long vacation every year as his guests. Mr. Swain s 
increasing disabilities now made it desirable to re 
verse these positions of host and guest; and the 
control of the island was consequently handed over 
to my father. The " Governor " charged him in a 
pathetic letter, dated 2d December, 1856, to pre 
serve " that simplicity which is after all the great 
charm of such a place/ and urged that " the secret 
of enjoyment for those who visited the island had 
been the feeling that the hospitalities of the place 
were dispensed without being a tax upon the family, 
no labored attempts at entertainment either at the 
table or elsewhere, but people left to enjoy them 
selves in the most simple way." From this time 
the island became my parents summer and autumn 
home. I think it will have appeared from what I 
have told of their life there that they entirely sym 
pathized with the views of their relative, and carried 
them out as host and hostess in letter and spirit, so 
long as this was practicable. 

With the view of insuring easy access to the 
island my father got his brother Bennet to model 
for him the schooner Azalea and supervise the 
building of her. He speaks of her as being needed 



160 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

for " a family carry-all in those days when we had 
no railway to Wood s Hole and only a tri-weekly 
steamer between New Bedford and Naushon." She 
entirely answered her purpose and did good service 
in both work and play for more than a score of 
years. 

For the ten years preceding the time at which we 
have arrived, my father s business in ships and mer 
chandise had been gradually decreasing, and its 
management largely delegated to others. His own 
personal interest had become centred in the grow 
ing railroad systems of the West. His work was 
mainly devoted to the Michigan Central, and to the 
enterprise already, in 1856, known by its permanent 
title of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Kail- 
road, with which, from its first small beginnings as 
a feeder of the older line, he had been so intimately 
connected. This change, no doubt, was partly due 
to the altered conditions of trade with the East, 
caused by the introduction of steamships. As yet 
the ocean telegraph, which was soon to do away 
with the old-fashioned China merchant, had not 
come. But men were already dreaming of it, and 
experimenting with it. 

There were two reasons which conspired to 
gether, as time went on, to involve my father more 
in railroads and less in the shipping business. In 
the first place, railroads, in their early days, had a 
tendency towards financial bogs, and he was always 
being called on to help them out. Once interested 
in any affair, it was one of his marked traits, when 



SLAVERY 161 

that particular bit of business was in a bad place, 
never to rest until by dint of hard tugging he had 
pulled it out. The other reason may be made 
clear by what a partner in his old firm in China 
said of him : " Mr. Forbes never seemed to me a 
man of acquisitiveness, but very distinctly one of 
constructiveness. His wealth was only an inci 
dent. I have seen many occasions when much more 
money might have been made by him in some busi 
ness transaction but for this dominant passion for 
building up things. The good, also, which he anti 
cipated for workmen and settlers through opening 
up the country always weighed much with him." 

His views, at that time, as to the future of the 
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Kailroad, may be 
seen in the following reply to queries addressed to 
him by his correspondent in Calcutta, Mr. George 
Ashburner : 

MILTON, January 19, 1857. 

MY DEAR MR. ASHBURNER, ... You ask what 
permanent advantage the Chicago, Burlington and 
Quincy has over other roads to the Mississippi ? 

It runs through the very finest country in the 
State and in a very direct line, has two feeders from 
the West, no hurtful competition yet, good outlets 
East, efficient officers and an honest president who 
wants to get rid of the office, and never sought it, 
and a local traffic which must, I think, always give 
it a fair business even if its through traffic dimin 
ishes. It has not been built very economically, 
having paid high prices for labor and iron, and 



162 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

some high shaves in selling its bonds, as you can 
testify ; but it has been run by honest and very in 
telligent men, simply and purely for the interest of 
the stockholders, and not for any town, village, 
other railroad, or individual. It has been, up to 
this time, managed by people having a large in 
terest in it, and what mistakes or extravagances 
they have committed have been honest ones, grow 
ing out of their being too full of work to attend to 
details as much as our New England Yankees do ; 
and against this rather lavish expense I put the 
advantage of having it planned and managed by 
large minds who looked ahead, and knew the great 
interests they had to care for. 

Now, it is not to be denied that, in that flat coun 
try, others may at a time of cheap money and iron, 
come alongside of it and build a cheaper road that 
could diminish its profits, but with so wide a field 
open as those prairies give I should think railroad 
enterprise would naturally take other unoccupied 
fields for years to come. Still there lies its danger. 
Of course it has others, like all railroads, from 
change of management, dishonest financial manage 
ment, etc., but it has passed safely through the 
infantile diseases of railroads, and its chance seems 
to me good for the future. It is not cursed with 
branches. . . . 

So much for the intrinsic advantages of the rail 
road ; now as to its comparative ones. I have not 
the means of judging, as it requires infinite time 
and trouble to dig deep into the bowels of a cor- 



SLAVERY 163 

poration ; I can only say that the other roads there 
may have a country nearly as good, and a location 
nearly as good, but some have a complication of 
doubtful branches, some zigzag to meet local in 
terests, some have been built by contractors who 
were directors, and pronounced on the proper execu 
tion of their own work ! And as to the others, it is 
hard to say how far honesty and intelligence have 
directed them. Some may be cheaper and better 
than this ; but I am too old to go into the investi 
gation of their merits, preferring, until this line 
gets much higher and others lower, to stick to the 
one that I know has had certain positive advan 
tages over the majority of roads, by being located, 
planned, and built by the right sort of men, and 
also the advantage of proving by its results from 
month to month, that the projectors only under 
rated the pecuniary results of their work. True, 
they also underrated its cost ; but that is a chronic 
complaint about railroads ! . . . 

Very truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 

No note of warning is sounded in this letter to 
Mr. Ashburner of the coming financial panic of 
1857. I suspect the truth was that, busy in altering 
the mansion house at Naushon, and on the thousand 
details incident to his occupation of the island, he 
did not follow the business world with quite the 
same keen sight as was habitual to him. Possibly 
too, intent, up to 1856, on the management of the 
Michigan Central, he did not see that overbuilding 



164 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

of railroads was going on throughout the West, 
tying up capital in non-paying and ill-advised 
adventures and bringing on the crash, of which 
an account is given in the following chapter. 



CHAPTER VII 

THE BUSINESS PANIC OF 1857. THE IMPENDING 

POLITICAL CRISIS 

THE year 1857 seems to have opened quietly for 
my father. I find him writing, in April, to Mr. 
Edward Cunningham, one of the partners in Rus 
sell & Co., who was about to return home from 
China, and discussing the sale of " blacks and cheap 
greens " (teas), the new minister to England, and 
French and English operations in China. He writes 
in his notes, "I had left the Michigan Central 
presidency, and though still a director, I considered 
myself on the retired list and remained quietly at 
Naushon all summer, hardly attending at all to the 
railroad." 

The following letter from Mr. William Sturgis, 
directed to him at Naushon, shows that at the be 
ginning of September he could not have been con 
templating any excitements apart from those to be 
looked for on the island : 

BOSTON, September 5, 1857. 

MY DEAR FORBES, On my return from that 
centre of " Devildom," New York city, I found 
your kind note inviting me to a hunt on the 22d 



166 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

inst., and time was when I should have accepted it 
as eagerly as the governor would a challenge to a 
game at all-fours, at which he is usually sure to 
be beaten, but now, alas, though the spirit is will 
ing and more than willing, the flesh, especially the 
lower extremities, cannot be relied upon, and I dare 
not make the attempt. 

Do not think I am deterred by apprehensions of 
broken limbs or a bruised body under your guid 
ance. Any one who has followed you as I have, 
carrying a heavy gun on a wild colt dashing at full 
speed through dense woods, and over that so-called 
trotting-course full of holes, stumps, scrub oaks, 
and tangled briars, and escaped a smash-up, may 
feel assured that fate has destined him for some 
other end than a broken neck by such means. 

You say that you have " made a thorough re 
form, clearing out all the old break-neck horses 
and substituting well-bred and well-broken animals." 
I am bound to think that you believe what you say, 
but I got an idea of what you consider a " well- 
bred and well-broken " animal from a description I 
have had, and a sketch I have seen, of an occurrence 
that took place a few months since, which would 
satisfy the most incredulous that he would be as 
safe in driving one of your reform horses as he 
would be in a wagon harnessed to a fresh caught 
mustang stallion in the middle of a Western prairie. 

You refer to the elder Mr. Quincy ; now that 
won t do, my dear fellow. You cannot make a stool- 
pigeon of the venerable gentleman ; even his cer- 



THE BUSINESS PANIC OF 1857 167 

tificate would not neutralize the stubborn fact above 
alluded to. 

Seriously, though, I should very much like to 
gratify the Governor God bless him by joining 
the hunt, and gratify myself by meeting the old set 
of sportsmen once more, yet I dare not venture to 
undertake that which requires more physical pow 
ers than any one can expect to possess at seventy- 
six. I must, therefore, content myself with again 
thanking you for the invitation and assuring you 
that I am faithfully yours, 

WM. STURGIS. 

The financial panic, " more extensive than that 
of 1837 and equally sharp while it lasted," as my 
father says of it in his notes, must have struck Bos 
ton about the middle of the month, for I find the 
following to Mr. Edward Cunningham, then in Eu 
rope, on his way home from China : 

BOSTON, September 28, 1857. 

MY DEAR EDWARD, We are in such a crisis 
here as only those who went through 1837 can con 
ceive of. J. K. Mills & Co. and many stronger 
houses have gone, and other large ones on Milk 
Street only exist by sufferance, and many large 
manufacturing companies are in the same straits. 

New York Central Railroad has run down from 
87 to 55, and Michigan Central from 95 to 45, 
while the weaker concerns are clear out of sight 
Erie 10, Southern Michigan 10-15. 



168 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Having taken in sail, not expecting a storm, but 
out of pure laziness, I am very easy unless other 
people swamp me ; but I don t believe W. Appleton s 
note indorsed by W. Sturgis would bring $100,000 
here within forty-eight hours, at three per cent, per 
month, such is the panic. 

. . . Tell B. the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy 
Kailroad seems very snug for a month or two to 
come, and Joy is sanguine that it will do a fine busi 
ness when the crops begin to move east. 

Yours always, J. M. F. 

It is clear that he had not then the least expecta 
tion of meeting his correspondent on the other side 
of the Atlantic. But he was not long to remain 
" on the retired list." 

Early in October he was called up from Naushon 
and urgently requested to go to London to get a 
loan of two million dollars, which might prevent 
the Michigan Central Railroad becoming bankrupt. 
As to the policy which had brought the road face to 
face with such a dilemma, he writes in his notes : 
"Somehow the directors had taken the view that 
the high rates for money in the street were only 
temporary ; and so for the needful construction and 
other outlays they had allowed the company to incur 
a heavy floating debt instead of selling stock and 
bonds to meet their outlays." But the crisis had to 
be met, and he could not refuse to go ; so, taking 
his two eldest daughters with him, he started for 
London by the next steamer. He soon accomplished 



THE BUSINESS PANIC OF 1857 169 

his object, obtaining the needed loan from the Bar 
ings, though, as was inevitable in time of panic, on 
very onerous terms. 

During this English visit he made a trip with his 
daughters to France, where his stay was saddened 
by the sickness and death, in Paris, of a cousin, 
Charles Hathaway, of whom my father was very 
fond. He was with him at the end, and he had to 
see to things for the widow before leaving. While 
in Paris he discovered that the great efficiency of 
Louis Napoleon s police could be turned to good 
account. He heard by chance that Mr. E. Cunning 
ham must have got wind of the panic in the United 
States, and that he was hurrying home through 
France that very day, not dreaming of his own pre 
sence in Paris. My father went to the Police Bu 
reau, and managed to have him arrested as he was 
embarking for England ; and thus was able to satisfy 
him, when they met the next morning, that he had 
attended to his affairs before leaving Boston, and that 
there was no need for his giving up a particularly 
pleasant European tour, which he had been enjoying 
when the news of the panic had struck him. 

My father and his daughters returned to New 
York by the American steamship Atlantic, com 
manded by his friend, Captain Eldridge. They had 
reckoned on opening the house at Naushon and eat 
ing their Thanksgiving dinner there, but just as they 
were about to leave Milton for New Bedford he got 
an urgent telegram from General Fremont, the Re 
publican candidate whom Buchanan had defeated at 



170 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

the late election, begging him to meet him in Boston 
about some affairs very important to the General. 
So my father sent part of the family ahead to catch 
the steamer from New Bedford to Naushon, and 
went to Boston himself. As soon as he was free of 
the Fremont business, he whisked off the rest of 
the party, and, catching at New Bedford " a rickety 
fishing-smack bound towards the Vineyard," landed 
at the island, where, as he says, in spite of cold 
weather and a smoky chimney, they managed to 
have a very jolly visit. 

Soon after this, the Michigan Central passed into 
New York hands, and my father sold out his interest 
in it " at only a moderate profit on the investment 
to pay for some ten years hard and responsible work 
without pay." 1 But he had gained experience which 
was invaluable to himself and the Chicago, Burling 
ton and Quincy Railroad, then in rapid course of 
development. 

The railroad panic had, it would appear, shaken 
the confidence of the Barings in American credit 
generally, for I find that my father wrote in March, 
1858, to their Boston agent, Mr. S. G. Ward, show 
ing, with regard to the credits which he still found 
it convenient to have from them, in view of his 
Chinese shipments, that he had seldom used more 
than half their amount, and adding that he had 
never had at one time more than half of what he 
was actually worth, invested in merchandise. What 
he wrote satisfied his London friends that in mer-

cantile matters he was what he claimed to be, " ultra 
conservative." 

But it was neither commerce nor railroads that 
now occupied the chief place in his thoughts. Poli 
tics were rapidly becoming his absorbing interest. 
Prior to 1850 he had been a subscribing but not 
active member of the Whig party, the leaders of 
which in Boston were among his social friends ; but 
the time came when he found this no longer possible. 
He writes in his notes : 

" When Webster made his great speech, on the 
7th of March, 1850, supporting the Fugitive Slave 
Law, and indorsing all the compromises by which 
we surrendered to the slave-owners, the scales fell 
from my eyes, and I gave up the Whig party and 
acted in my quiet way with the Republicans, then 
called &lt; Free-Soilers. " 

Apparently his withdrawal from the Whig party 
and his reasons for withdrawal caused only hilarity 
among his friends (the Whig leaders), for in men 
tioning that they continued to come to the deer 
hunts at Naushon he adds, as to the talk on those 
occasions : 

" Our discussions were frequent upon politics, but 
were good-natured ; and I especially remember the 
roar of laughter which followed my very innocent 
question, What are you going to do about the 
Wilmot Proviso ? (against extending slavery into 
territories then free). Why/ shouted they, the 
Wilmot Proviso ! You will never hear of it again ; 
but look for it among the old flags and torn posters 



172 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

of the campaign; it has served its purpose, like 
them, for the time, but will now disappear. They 
w ere practical politicians and really believed so." 

But long before Buchanan s election in 1856 
my father s friends among "practical politicians" 
must have begun to suspect that the principle repre 
sented by the Wilmot Proviso was not going to be 
put away among the old " campaign flags and torn 
posters;" and now that the political cauldron had 
come to show unmistakable signs of boiling over, 
they must have been convinced that it was making 
a very live issue indeed. What my father thought 
of the situation will appear from the following letter 
to one of the partners in Russell & Co., then in 
Paris : 

J. M. FORBES TO N. M. BECKWITH. 

MILTON, January 17, 1858. 

MY DEAR BECKWITH, ... I suppose you get 
out of the papers all our politics. They are, in a 
nutshell : James Buchanan, or rather James Plat 
form, having sold himself to the South, has blun 
dered right and left, and especially has played into 
the hands of Douglas, who will make capital enough 
out of squatter sovereignty to divide the North at 
the next election, and will quietly turn to the South 
and say to their old file leaders, " That old fool 
Buchanan was spoiling your game; Kansas was 
gone, and he was ruining the Democratic party at 
the North for an abstraction ; your only allies are 
the Northern Democrats : you know me to be just 



THE IMPENDING POLITICAL CRISIS 173 

as deeply pro-slavery as any man can be who can 
get a show of hands at the North ; vote for me and 
you get the power four years longer, and with the 
help of official patronage, and using the land-steal 
ing mania adroitly, and above all by returning 
from bullying to the traditional policy of the South, 
viz., political management, you can continue to 
divide the North and retain power indefinitely, or at 
any rate until, with Northern men and money, you 
have gained all the territory you want ; and then 
you can try bullying again, and either govern or 
dissolve the Union," 

Such, I fear, is the programme, and to my eye the 
" situation " looks worse than it has any time since 
the Nebraska villainy was planned. Douglas has 
retrieved his position, lost by that folly, and from 
his superior boldness is the most dangerous opponent 
free principles can have. Of course, we shall fight 
him to the last ! 

My father had supported Fremont at the pre 
vious election, but was very doubtful as to whether 
his speculative tendencies and consequent unsavory 
hangers-on did not disqualify him as leader in that 
which was to come. At the same time he recog 
nized that " Seward was too much of a hack, McLean 
too old, Sumner too theoretical and egotistic," and 
doubted whether "Commodore Paulding was man 
enough, even if the South would consent to perse 
cute him till he became a hero in the eyes of the 
North." Then again, though he sympathized in a 



174: JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

great measure with the Abolitionists, amongst whom 
he had many friends and relatives, he could not, 
as a true patriot, longing for the keeping of the 
peace, help seeing their rashness and trying to keep 
them within bounds. Thus, to Wendell Phillips 
and others, prior to one of their Abolitionist meet 
ings in Boston, he gave the following advice : 

" You had better use your influence to defer, if 
not give up entirely, the meeting. The Boston 
Republicans have not hardened enough to stand the 
test. The Bell-Everetts and Democrats, touched in 
their pockets, are in a highly irritated state. At 
the night meeting the Abolitionists vindicated their 
right to speak, and the community is with them 
now, as having both been persecuted and shown 
pluck after it. Let them be content to wait. At 
that night meeting it is reported that large numbers 
of Abolitionists went armed with deadly weapons. 
If they have another, there is every probability that 
the young broadcloth rowdies and the Ann Street 
men will also go armed. Suppose a coUision takes 
place and serious consequences come, the pro-slavery 
party, if successful, may consider the present to 
their Southern allies of a few Abolition lives as a 
peace offering that will help the Union and their 
pockets. On the other hand, if the Abolitionists 
succeed and some fatal consequences occur, it will 
turn the tide of sympathy from them. Their suc 
cess is very doubtful, mischief very imminent. 
They had better be content with their success or 
their draw-game as it now stands, and wait. 



THE IMPENDING POLITICAL CRISIS 175 

" Their policy is, towards the Kepublicans, to let 
them fight the pro-slavery men ; just as our policy 
in this time of excitement is to let the Union men 
of the South fight the fire-eaters. Let the extremes 
keep out of it as much as possible." 

The following letter to his son will show that in 
the midst of all this political turmoil my father did 
not forget the good of his family : 

Tuesday, 29 January, [1858,] MILTON. 

MY DEAR : I am very sorry to hear from 

your mother that there is some doubt whether you 
can remain in college, unless you study more suc 
cessfully during the short remnant of the term, or 
use up your vacation. 

Now, my dear boy, do try for the rest of the 
term to make such an impression upon your teach 
ers as will help to remove the memory of past de 
ficiencies. 

Consider what a miserable thing it will be to 
begin life by a failure ! What a bad augury for 
your future fortunes ! 

You may think it is only because you have no 
taste for study that you succeed so ill, but you 
must remember that in the beginnings of all work 
you must sacrifice taste to duty and principle. All 
the real work of life goes hard until you have ac 
customed yourself to do it manfully, without con 
sidering your inclinations, and then work often 
becomes a pleasure, and always forms the basis of 
true happiness or content. 



176 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

It may seem to you too late now to begin, but it 
is not so. Take hold with a will ; make your teach 
ers feel that you have a disposition to retrieve ; and 
you will find they will make allowances for you on 
account of your accident, and you may still begin 
the term with a fair reputation. 

Perhaps I have done wrongly in not saying this 
to you earlier, but I hate to be always before you as 
a monitor. I want to be in your mind as your best 
friend, ready to promote all innocent enjoyments 
and to look lightly on your faults ; but I do want 
to see you act a man s part in this world, and to do 
so you must make great sacrifices of your taste and 
inclination. Do not make the dreadful mistake of 
thinking it is the circumstances of the present that 
control you, and that at some future time you will 
change. 

The present is all that belongs to you. Now, I 
have the means to give you an education that will 
always (if properly used now) put you on a higher 
level than the mass ; put you among the workers 
with the head instead of the hands. Now you 
have youth, and health, and kind friends to encour 
age you. All this may change at any moment. 

" Your hand will never be stronger, 
Nor wanted as now to-day" 

Ever your affectionate FATHER. 

To return to the political situation. Among its 
great perplexities there was, for him personally, an 
additional complication. His railroad interests had 



THE IMPENDING POLITICAL CRISIS 177 

led him into building, as has been said, the Hanni 
bal and St. Joseph line, the stock of which stood in 
the name of three trustees, of whom he was chair 
man and manager. He therefore was responsible to 
all the stockholders of the road for its prudent con 
duct. This road ran through the heart of Missouri, 
a bitterly pro-slavery country ; and however indig 
nant my father might be at the claims and conduct 
of the South, he yet, so long as he represented other 
people s property, could not, in justice to them, pro 
claim in the market-place his distaste for pro-slavery 
methods. On the other hand, the railroad was the 
direct connecting link of Kansas with the East, and 
over it, supplied with money and Sharps rifles, 
which he had helped to provide, came the free men 
from Massachusetts, bent on preventing the dreaded 
institution of slavery from gaining a foothold on 
that disputed ground. The latest compromise with 
the South had thrown the responsibility of slavery 
or freedom in Kansas on the voters, and the pro- 
slavery Missourians were contesting the election, 
revolvers in hand. The Free-Soil party were the 
men responsible for the Kansas immigration, and 
with them my father worked quietly all through 
that time, until at last, as he says in his notes, 
" The rebellion broke out, and I was glad to be 
able to join the party of freedom and to have the 
chance to raise the money needed for supplying 
uniforms to the first loyal regiment which General 
Frank Blair raised in Missouri." 

To those born in times when people accept all 



178 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

such stories very much as ancient history, perhaps 
the following letters will not bring the thrill that 
they are likely to rouse in such of us as have lived 
through the period described ; but " lest we forget " 
the suffering, struggles, and inspiration of the time 
preceding the war, as well as the war itself, I give 
them. 

S. G. HOWE TO J. M. FORBES. 

NEW YORK, February 5, 1859. 

MY DEAR SIR, A friend requests me to write 
a line to you introducing Captain John Brown of 
Kansas. 

I have carefully watched the movements of Brown 
for two years and have considerable personal know 
ledge of him. He is of the stuff of which martyrs 
are made. He is of the Puritan order militant. He 
is called fighting Brown, because under his natural 
and unaffected simplicity and modesty there is an 
irresistible propensity to war upon injustice and 
wrong. He is cool, fearless, keen, and ready with 
all his mental and bodily powers in the most sudden 
and imminent dangers. If you would like to talk 
with him upon the square, and hear what he has to 
say about what might perhaps seem at first to be 
treason, he will be glad to talk with you. 

So far as one man can answer for another whom 
he has not known very long and intimately, I can 
answer for Brown s honesty of purpose. 

Faithfully yours, S. G. HOWE. 



THE IMPENDING POLITICAL CRISIS 179 

THE SAME TO THE SAME. 

BOSTON, May 9, 1859. 

MY DEAR SIR, Captain Brown (old J. B.) is 
here. If any one desires to get the thirty-two 
hundred and fifty dollars reward offered for his 
apprehension by the governor of Missouri and the 
President of the United States, he has only to go 
to the hotel in Beach Street, and try to take the 
old fellow. 

He is a character, I assure you ; and if you are 
disposed to have a conversation with him, he will 
call at your house, or your office, as you may ap 
point. He knows more about the question of prac 
tical emancipation than any one whom I have seen. 
Faithfully yours, S. G. HOWE. 

My father gives in his notes the following account 
of the visit from John Brown. The statements as 
to numbers and position, recalled nearly thirty years 
after the events, do not always accord with those in 
the printed records. I give them as they stand : 

" When I received the last of Dr. Howe s letters, 
I was busy in town, and wished to show the captain 
to the rest of my family ; so I invited him and Mr. 
Frank Sanborn out to Milton to tea, and one rainy 
night they appeared. We summoned such neigh 
bors as we could easily reach, among them William 
Hunt, and had a most interesting evening, and in 
deed night ; for, the storm continuing, we kept them 
over and sat up talking until after midnight. 



180 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

" Captain Brown was a grim, farmer-like looking 
man, with a long gray beard and glittering, gray- 
blue eyes which seemed to me to have a little touch 
of insanity about them. I did all I could to draw 
the old man out and make him talk, first politics 
and then about his adventures in Kansas. He re 
pelled, almost with scorn, my suggestion that firm 
ness at the ballot-box by the North and West might 
avert the storm ; and said it had passed the stage 
of ballots, and nothing but bayonets and bullets 
could settle it now. He had been visiting Europe, 
partly on wool business, for he had been and per 
haps was still a wool buyer or broker, and had 
seen a good deal of the European armies, then in 
open war, and made many shrewd comparisons be 
tween their methods and ours, talking like a man 
who had made war his study as well as practice. 
Leading him back into Kansas by asking him about 
the battle of Ossawatomie he replied, in his jerky 
way of throwing out his words, 6 That was n t any 
battle ! t was all on one side ; and then he told 
me that on that day he had been roused by having 
his son killed by the Missouri border ruffians, and 
another son dragged at their horses heels all day 
in the sun, until he was nearly frantic ; he had 
raised a small force (I think only thirty) to watch 
the invaders, and perhaps get a chance to strike a 
blow at them. Waiting on the edge of a large 
swamp, through which he could at any time retreat, 
he saw the enemy coming along careless and con 
fident. How many, Captain Brown ? Wai, they 



THE IMPENDING POLITICAL CRISIS 181 

said there was 270 of them. When they were 
within close shooting distance, his little band poured 
in a volley which threw them all in a huddle, and 
they completely lost their heads, while he repeated 
the attack. At last they realized how small the 
Free-Soil force was and made a serious attempt to 
attack it, and then Captain Brown just scuttled off 
through the swamp without much or any loss. 
How many did you kill ? we asked. Wai, they 
said we hurt seventy of em. But you had some 
real fights with them, captain ? He reflected a 
moment, and then told us of the battle of Black 
Jack. When Major, or Colonel, Henry Clay Pate 
came against him with twenty-eight well-armed men, 
fitted out at the East on purpose, he marched nine 
to oppose them, and chose a well-covered clump of 
black jacks, while they advanced on the open 
prairie, until they were within easy reach of their 
long-range rifles ; then he opened fire from his 
ambuscade, and picked them off until they sur 
rendered. They could n t do nothing else, he 
modestly said, for we were under cover, and had 
only lost two or three, while they could neither ad 
vance or retreat, for you could see a guse s head 
(not goose s) 300 yards. So with his remaining 
four or five men he marched what was left of the 
enemy back captives with their well-burnished arms, 
one of which I remember was a very fine revolver 
presented to Henry Clay Pate by his neighbors, 
when setting off on his expedition. 

" The captain had to go to town by the earliest 



182 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

train, so I saw no more of him after that night ; 
indeed did not hear much of him until his outbreak 
at Harper s Ferry, to which I had contributed $100 
or so, supposing it to be merely for use in Kansas. 
When our parlor girl got up early, to open the 
house, she was startled by finding the grim old 
soldier sitting bolt upright in the front entry, fast 
asleep ; and when her light awoke him, he sprang 
up and put his hand into his breast-pocket, where 
I have no doubt his habit of danger led him to 
carry a revolver." 

By an odd chance the very next day Governor 
Stewart, the pro-slavery governor of Missouri (who 
had set the price of $3250 on John Brown s head), 
" appeared on railroad business, and he too passed 
the night at Milton, little dreaming who had pre 
ceded him in my guest room. Some six months 
later came John Brown s capture at Harper s Ferry, 
his surrender to Robert E. Lee, and then his execu 
tion. 1 This was really almost the turning-point of 
our own rebellion, but we hardly appreciated the 
consequences then." 

It was at this time that my father made the 
acquaintance of John A. Andrew, so soon to be 
come famous as the great war-governor of Massa 
chusetts, but then only "a leading young lawyer 
in Boston," employed to defend one of Brown s 
adherents. 

It was nearly a year later, in November, 1860, 
when Lincoln was chosen president. My father 

i On December 2, 1859. 



THE IMPENDING POLITICAL CRISIS 183 

writes in his notes : " I had never taken any recog 
nized part in public affairs, and I cannot now 
remember why I was made one of the electors at 
large and so had a hand in electing him president. 
Perhaps it was because the Free-Soil party wished 
to ally themselves here with the business men that 
they chose me for that position. I still have some 
where, as a relic, the pen with which I signed the 
certificate of our election of Lincoln, about the 
beginning of 1861." 

What my father thought of the coming presi 
dent s self-reliance, before he came in personal con 
tact with him, will appear from the following letter 
to Mr. Senior : 

J. M. FORBES TO NASSAU WILLIAM SENIOR. 

BOSTON, June 18, 1860. 

MY DEAR MR. SENIOR, Thinking you may be 
interested in the antecedents of our promised ruler 
Lincoln, I send through my bookseller a copy of his 
speeches (and Douglas s) during their great fight 
for the Illinois senatorship which form his chief 
record. 

From such of them as I have read I get the idea 
that he is an earnest, rough, quick-witted man, 
persistent and determined, half educated, but self- 
reliant and self-taught. These speeches, made be 
fore Seward s, show that Lincoln originated in these 
latter days the utterance of the " irrepressible con 
flict," and what is more, stuck to it manfully. 
Those who know him assure me that he is honest 



184 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

and straightforward and owned by no clique of 
hackneyed politicians. 

Seward was killed by his association with the 
politicians who joined in the plundering of the 
last New York legislature, and by his speech in 
the Senate ignoring the irrepressible conflict and 
smoothing over his supposed radicalism. 

The first evil lost him the confidence of the right 
sort of men, not because they believed him corrupt, 
but from the bad company he had been in and 
would probably be in again ! His latter-day con 
servatism conciliated his enemies, who would not, 
however, vote for him, happen what might; and 
cooled the zeal of his radical supporters, and espe 
cially of the country people. I think on the whole 
the actual nominee will run better and be quite as 
likely to administer well when in. We shall elect 
him, I think, triumphantly, by the people; and 
avoid that abominable expedient, an election by the 
House, filled as it is with so large a proportion 
of mere politicians. There is some danger that we 
shall be disgusted with a repetition of the log-cabin 
and hard-cider style of campaigning which was so 
successful in the Harrison election, but this is a 
minor evil compared with either having Douglas, 
with his filibustering crew, or a set of Albany wire 
pullers under a Republican administration. . . . 

Although you say nothing about it, I still hope 
you will come out this summer and take care of 
your young prince and see our heir apparent ! 

Yours very truly, J. M. FORBES. 



THE IMPENDING POLITICAL CRISIS 185 

In October of this year came the death of my 
eldest sister, a very lovely girl only twenty-one 
years old. I have already spoken of the tender 
love given to sons and daughters by my father. 
This break in the home circle gave him a deep 
wound, and was partly the cause of his undertaking 
the inordinate work during the civil war, which fills 
a large space in the following chapters. 

Fragments of the war-cloud were already begin 
ning to fly across the Atlantic and to attract the 
attention of observers in the Old World. The 
widow of Alexis de Tocqueville, 1 in writing to my 
father in November, 1860, says : 

" At last, returned home to quiet and repose, I 
feel more courageous, more curious, and I venture 
to ask you to tell me the probable result of this new 
conflict between the Republicans and the Demo 
crats. You are a most volcanic people, and when 
one fancies you are in a dead calm, out bursts a 
tremendous storm." 

It was indeed a " tremendous storm " that was 
now impending. In meeting it my father was for 
quick and vigorous measures. A very different 
policy was that of Mr. Seward, the coming chief of 
Mr. Lincoln s cabinet, for whom and for whose 
political methods my father had long had an anti 
pathy. 

In closing this chapter, I give an extract from 
one of Charles Sumner s letters, which showed that 

1 My father cared for her American investments, as he had done 
for those of her husband. ED. 



186 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

he shared his correspondent s feelings in this mat 
ter : 

WASHINGTON, 13 January, 1861. 

MY DEAR FORBES, ... I think you will agree 
with me in regretting the tone of Seward s speech. 
He read it to me last Tuesday, and I protested most 
earnestly against every word of compromise, con 
cession, or offer to the traitors. I wish to try the 
strength of the government now. Surely it is not 
worth having, on the condition that any one State 
may at any time break it up. If this is the rule, it 
were better to know it now, and govern ourselves 
accordingly. We must not postpone this question 
until still greater interests will depend upon it. 
Besides, what kind of concession can we offer? 
Ignoble will it be in us to concede beyond the 
Constitution, which of itself embodies all that our 
fathers would concede. 

The South calls Seward s speech a " cheat." It 
is unsatisfactory, except to a very few. Even Cam 
eron, of Pennsylvania, told me that he regretted he 
should " so let down the party." 

If the North will be firm, our future will be 
bright. For God s sake, let there be no waver 
ing. . . . 

Good-by ! Ever sincerely yours, 

CHARLES SUMNER. 



CHAPTER VIII 

THE BEGINNING OF WAR 

WE have now arrived at the beginning of those 
five years the high pressure of which must have 
equaled that of any other fifteen of my father s 
life, those, namely, which covered the war of the 
Rebellion and the beginning of reconstruction. The 
reader will find the selections from the notes and 
letters exactly as these stand ; though in some cases 
time has rendered a different verdict from that 
given, off-hand, by a man to whose eager tempera 
ment and fiery energy the course of events seemed 
often embarrassed by unnecessary and absolutely 
intolerable delays. Whatever may be thought of 
my father s views, I am clear, at any rate, that to 
soften or withhold the distinct expression of his 
opinions would be to rob the writer of his individu 
ality, and to sin against historical truth. 

66 The war," writes my father in his notes, " vir 
tually began, for me, with what was called the 
Peace Congress, of February, 1861. 

" In January, Virginia asked the other States to 
send delegates to a congress for the purpose of de 
vising means to avert the civil war then threaten 
ing. This was pretty generally responded to at the 



188 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

North, and resulted in the meeting of what was 
called the Peace Congress at "Washington in the 
early part of February, 1861. It was unauthorized 
by law and entirely informal, and simply a con 
ference of men of the different States. Each State 
was represented by as many delegates as it had 
members of Congress, our Massachusetts contingent 
being thirteen (I think), all nominated by Governor 
Andrew, under authority from the legislature. Of 
my colleagues on the Massachusetts delegation I 
recall the names of George S. Boutwell, J. Z. Good 
rich, F. N. Crowninshield, T. P. Chandler, and B. F. 
Waters, of Marblehead, as having been the most 
active. 

" We started, nearly all together, about February 
10, with the political horizon everywhere darkly 
lowering. My wife and daughter Mary accom 
panied me, and, through the kindness of Captain 
W. H. Swift, I had secured an asylum for them 
with Baron Stoeckel, the Russian ambassador, to 
be availed of in case the rebels pushed into Wash 
ington, an event which seemed as probable as it 
really was easy of accomplishment, had the rebels 
been half as smart as we thought them. 

" At Philadelphia we took a special train pro 
vided for us and other delegates, among whom I 
remember General John E. Wool, of the United 
States army, from New York, who astonished us 
by the boldness of his prediction that in case the 
rebels proceeded to actual violence, one hundred 
thousand men would spring to arms from the North 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 189 

and West, sweeping all before them. Mr. S. M. 
Felton, the president of the Philadelphia, Wilming 
ton and Baltimore road, joined us, and taking me 
aside proceeded to show me his plans for meeting 
the designs of the rebels against the long bridges 
we were passing over, which he had discovered 
through his detectives. These were simply to take 
steamers at the north bank of the Susquehanna 
(where his line was safe) and send troops around to 
Annapolis and Washington by water. It is note 
worthy that when, in April, General Butler reached 
Philadelphia, and found these very bridges burned, 
and Baltimore practically an enemy s city, Felton 
had great difficulty, with the help of Admiral Du- 
pont, in showing the general that the Annapolis 
plan was the true one. Once adopted, Butler al 
ways assumed to himself the credit of the dis 
covery. Mr. Felton at the same time confidentially 
informed me of the plot which he had discovered 
to attack President Lincoln on his way through 
Baltimore, and intrusted to me a message to W. H. 
Seward in regard to it, and to the mode of defeat 
ing it, by sending Mr. Lincoln through incog., after 
cutting the telegraph wires ; all which was exactly 
carried into effect about a month later. From 
Philadelphia I telegraphed G. W. Brown, the mayor 
of Baltimore, and his partner, F. W. Brune (my old 
friend), that I would stay the night there to discuss 
the state of affairs with them. That night Mayor 
Brown came to Barnum s Hotel and spent the even 
ing with me. Though full of local Baltimore feel- 



190 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

ing, I found him in the main loyal and well dis 
posed, and promising to do all in his power to keep 
the peace in Baltimore ; and I have never doubted 
his sincerity. When our troops were attacked in 
the streets on the 19th of April, he put himself at 
their head, and did everything he could personally 
to protect them. He did not realize the full mag 
nitude of the crisis, but to the extent of his light 
he was sound and honest. I remember asking his 
opinion about one expedient which was then under 
discussion, and especially advocated by the Blairs ; 
it was for the United States to purchase the slaves 
and colonize them in Central America and the West 
Indies. His answer was that Maryland wanted every 
black she had, and more ; and that the large body of 
free blacks in his city were among the best of their 
laboring population, with less rioting, less drunken 
ness, and fewer paupers than any other class ! 
Later, Seward had Brown imprisoned at Fort War 
ren, where I visited him ; and when released had 
him for a day or two at Milton. 

" The next morning we went on to Washington, 
and took possession of comfortable rooms on the 
14th Street side of Willard s Hotel, in the large 
hall of which the Peace Congress was in session. 
The alarm was so general that the city was not 
crowded and was especially bare of ladies from 
abroad. 

"We soon plunged into our work, our advent 
having very much the effect of a bombshell explo 
sion. Before our arrival the talk had been chiefly 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 191 

of compromise, and some progress seemed to have 
been made in preparing the way for a surrender 
by the North on the basis of the Crittenden Keso- 
lutions, so-called from Senator Crittenden, who in 
troduced them into the Senate. They practically 
surrendered the ground which the North and West 
had taken against the extension of slavery, and 
gave up the advanced position for freedom which 
had been gained after long years of conflict, and 
which was represented by the election of Lincoln. 
In the convention were Seddon, of Virginia, and 
Euffin, of North Carolina, who afterwards were 
prominent in the secession ranks, the first as secre 
tary of war, the other, I think, firing the first gun 
against Sumter. I am not sure about this, but Euf 
fin was distinguished as having given us one of our 
best anti-slavery weapons. When judge, he had 
carried the claims of the slave-owners to their legiti 
mate extreme, and decided that logically the system 
of slavery gave the master the supreme right to use, 
to punish, and if he thought necessary to kill his 
slave. 1 

" We who went to see what chance there was of 
any real peace, soon found that the Southerners in 
the convention were ready to receive any conces 
sions from us in the hope that it might do some 
good, but to commit themselves to nothing. 

1 The allusion is to the case of State v. Mann, 2 Devereux s Re 
ports, 263 (1829), an indictment for assault and battery upon a hired 
slave. This opinion became widely known by Mrs. Stowe s citation 
of it in her Key to Uncle Torrfs Cabin. ED. 



192 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

" When we asked the border States, Suppose the 
North concedes what you ask, will you join them in 
forcing the South to obey the laws ? ( No/ was 
the reply, but we should hope that such conces 
sions would lead to a settlement, and we will do all 
we peaceably can to bring this about. It was 
simply asking the majority to yield unconditionally 
to the minority all the great principles for which we 
had contested. 

" It was plain to us then, as it is now, that such 
concessions would have merely demoralized the 
North, and have led to more unreasonable demands. 
Our only policy was then to stand firm, and as the 
4th of March was approaching, when the weak old 
Buchanan and his Cabinet would go out, to make 
all the time we could in the Peace Convention, and 
avert as long as possible the onslaught of the better 
prepared South which was plainly impending. Our 
first move in the congress thus set them back from 
the prompt compromise which was proposed. We 
had been called to consider what remedies could be 
found for the alleged grievances of the South. So 
the Massachusetts delegates introduced a resolution 
calling upon the representatives of the border States, 
who had asked us to meet them, for a statement 
of the grievances which we were asked to redress. 
This led to long debates, and some of us who had 
not the gift of speaking, and could read the reports 
of the convention in print, turned our thoughts 
naturally to other modes of saving the Union. 

" One of these schemes soon suggested itself. 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 193 

Some little time after our arrival, I met quite a 
large party at dinner, who I remember were much 
animated by the report of General Dix s telegram, 
just then published, to the collector of Pensacola, 
( If any man tries to haul down the American 
flag, shoot him on the spot/ Sent to a post com 
pletely in the hands of the rebels, and unsupported 
by any force, it was rather a cheap piece of patriotic 
eloquence ; but it answered its purpose, for the day, 
of showing the right spirit in one of Buchanan s 
Cabinet, and it has since helped to put General Dix 
into the governor s chair of New York. At the 
same dinner W. H. Aspinwall, who, though not on 
the delegation of his State (New York), was an in 
terested and very influential visitor to the Capitol, 
took me aside and told me of a late conversation 
with General Scott then at the head of our army 
in which Scott had confided to him the great 
straits to which Major Anderson and the garrison 
of Fort Sumter were already reduced, the small 
supplies of ammunition and provisions, and the im 
possibility of so small a force making any successful 
resistance in case of attack. They were in fact 
dependent from day to day upon the Charleston 
market for their meat. We both agreed that it was 
an easy thing to reinforce Fort Sumter, and we there 
decided to call on General Scott after elaborating 
our plans, and propose to undertake it, Aspin 
wall having already told me that Lieutenant Fox, 
an able and experienced naval officer, was ready to 
lead the enterprise, and was confident of success. I 



194 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

may here mention that I had not before this heard 
of the man who so soon afterwards, as assistant 
secretary of the navy, was to play one of the most 
effective though least showy parts in the great 
struggle then impending. 

" The plan, which we agreed upon, was a double 
one, so as to have two chances. First : we proposed 
to buy a moderate-sized freighting vessel, put on 
board of her as stores the articles of most pressing 
necessity, and to have her enter Charleston, which 
port was still open, seeking a cotton freight ; but as 
she passed the fort she was to run under its guns, 
either going in or out as the best chance offered. 
Nobody but the captain was to know our plans, and 
the consignees were to be first-class secessionists, 
with whom the Boston owner was to begin a cor 
respondence at once, so as to divert suspicion. The 
mails were still open to Major Anderson, and some 
time after this Lieutenant Fox paid him a visit 
under secret orders from Washington. In this way 
everything but men could be thrown in, and by 
giving Major Anderson notice of our intention and 
establishing a signal, he would have been ready to 
protect the ship and land her stores, and it was 
even thought that part of the ship s crew might 
enlist after reaching there, and thus add to the 
little garrison. 

" Plan No. 2 was to fit out one or more propel 
lers ostensibly for Japan, load them with stores, and 
let each take in tow a couple of coasting schooners 
loaded below and on deck with Manila hemp, one 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 195 

on each side of the propeller, thus protecting her 
from shot, excepting those fired directly in front. 
Fox and a couple of hundred soldiers were to be 
added at the last moment. His experience in the 
navy convinced him that the untried gunners in 
the rebel batteries, firing at a moving object, would 
not disable either of them, and he stood ready to 
lead with the reinforcing troops. Subsequent expe 
rience in the Potomac and elsewhere proved that 
the chances were very slight of any disaster ; but if 
the danger had been far greater the exigency fully 
warranted the experiment. The steam frigate Pow- 
hatan was to convoy them down to the entrance 
of Charleston Harbor, or as far as her draught 
of water would permit, serving as a transport for 
the troops until transferred to the little propellers. 
They were to be bought, and sent at once to the 
Delaware Breakwater, and the schooners were to sail 
down at once to Charleston bar, they requiring very 
little time for preparing cargoes of hemp. 

" By appointment with General Scott, Mr. Aspin- 
wall and I called upon him on the evening of Feb 
ruary the 7th, and we remained with him until 
after midnight. As we developed our plans the 
general s spirits seemed to rise, and when we had 
finished he marched up and down his office, crying 
out, Qa ira, c,a ira ! It was agreed that Aspinwall 
should start the next morning for Philadelphia, 
where he knew of some propellers, inspect them and 
see what they were fit for, and learn their price, 
while I was to write to G. B. Upton, in Boston, and 



196 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

prepare him on receipt of a telegram to go ahead. 
At this time all the telegraph offices in Washington 
were filled with ( secesh, so I had arranged with 
Governor Andrew, before leaving Boston, a com 
mercial cipher code under which, using cotton bales 
and other terms to cover our political meaning, I 
could, through J. M. Forbes & Co., communicate 
with him without danger of our plans leaking out. 
Aspinwall and I left the good old general and his 
aide, Colonel Keyes, after midnight, in full faith that 
when I saw the general the next day I should get 
the final authority to go ahead, and we returned to 
the hotel, he to prepare for starting in the early 
train for Philadelphia, and I to write my letters for 
the morning mail. I had selected G. B. Upton, 
then in his prime, as the most active and efficient 
agent to do the business in Boston, and it was 
agreed that nobody outside the general s office, ex 
cept ourselves, Upton, and Fox, was to be admitted 
to our councils. The captains of the vessels were 
to be carefully selected, and were not to be in 
formed of our plans until the last moment. I spent 
the best part of the night in arranging the tele 
graphic ciphers to meet the new conditions, and in 
writing to Upton instructions which were at once to 
be carried into effect when he should receive my 
telegram ; and the next day (I think at about ten 
A. M.) I went by appointment to General Scott s 
headquarters. To my infinite disgust I found him 
closeted with Captain Ward of the navy (afterward 
killed on the Potomac), who had somehow got wind 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 197 

of an intended movement, and claimed that it ought 
to be intrusted to the navy. As Toucey was at the 
head of the Navy Department, and his loyalty was 
more than doubtful, and moreover as secrecy and 
promptness were totally incompatible with red tape 
and naval etiquette, I saw at once that the game 
was up, and I told Colonel Keyes that it would be 
worse than useless for us to go on with our scheme 
in combination with the navy, as suggested. As- 
pinwall and I had offered, for the sake of secrecy 
(the sine qua non of success in such an enterprise), 
to find the needful funds or credit, if fully author 
ized by General Scott to go ahead, and to trust to 
being reimbursed by government ; but we con 
sidered it indispensable that the whole control of 
the details and preliminary arrangements should be 
left with us. So our promising scheme fell through, 
and thus ended one of the efforts of a peace com 
missioner to save the Union ! 

"Later, about April 10th, 1861, Mr. Fox per 
suaded President Lincoln to let him undertake a 
similar project in the steamer Baltic ; but partly 
through Seward s double-faced diplomacy, and partly 
from being postponed till quite too late, it had lit 
tle chance of success. The rebel batteries had been 
immensely increased around the fort, and the rebels 
got notice of the intended movement, and opened 
fire before Fox and his transports arrived there. 
The Powhatan was, I think by Seward s interference, 
diverted from, or certainly delayed in, joining the 
expedition, and a gale of wind destroyed what little 



198 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

chance of success remained. Fort Sumter fell, and 
when the gale abated Fox had the melancholy sat 
isfaction of receiving on board the Baltic Major 
Anderson and his garrison, who had been obliged 
to make terms of surrender ! Had the 20th of 
February, 1861, opened with the news that a suf 
ficient garrison, well supplied with powder and pro 
visions, had been thrown into Fort Sumter, it might 
have changed the history of the war. 

" While the Peace Congress was slowly talking 
against time, and coming to no conclusions, Wash 
ington was, of course, the focus of the greatest 
excitement. Rebel State after State was seceding, 
a rebel Congress was sitting at Montgomery, in Ala 
bama, and the North was waiting for the inau 
guration of Lincoln before making any movement. 
Governor Andrew was taking active measures to 
organize and equip his militia. Seward was pro 
phesying that in sixty days the trouble would be 
over, and was negotiating with the rebels, and 
promising that Fort Sumter should not be rein 
forced. We in Washington were prepared each 
morning to see the rebel flags flying in that city, 
the Treasury sacked, and Congress, still in session, 
broken up. 

"Scott had less than one thousand men under 
him. Among other dangers was one of form which 
at one time looked threatening. Breckinridge, the 
Vice-President, was a well-known rebel, and Jeff 
Davis still retained his seat in the Senate, with 
some other similar villains. On a certain day in 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 199 

February it was the duty of the Vice-President, as 
president of the Senate, to march down at the head 
of that body from their chamber to the House of 
Representatives, carrying with them the electoral 
votes which had previously been deposited with 
them for that purpose. Until these votes had been 
opened in the presence of Congress, and counted, 
and the result declared, Lincoln could not become 
the President under the forms of the Constitution ; 
and in case this form could be prevented, it was 
thought possible that the rebels might claim that 
Buchanan and his Cabinet still held power. It was 
rumored that there was a plot to seize the ballots 
in the long and narrow halls through which the 
Senate passed nearly the whole length of the Capi 
tol; and with the traitor Breckinridge as the bearer 
of these ballots it would have been easy to play into 
the hands of the conspirators. Various plans were 
discussed for protecting ourselves against this dan 
ger (one, I remember, being to fill the vacant spaces 
in the Capitol with trusty men specially sent on 
from the North) ; but the rebels were much nearer 
than the loyal States; Washington, and even the 
Capitol under a rebel Vice-President, was full of 
traitors, and such a plan involving so many men 
was likely to be discovered, and might easily have 
been turned against us by substituting the Balti 
more and Washington roughs, or even the Virginia 
militia, who were right across the river, for our 
Northern allies ; so it was given up. Another ex 
pedient on which we did rely somewhat was this : 



200 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Captain W. H. Franklin, of Pennsylvania, a loyal 
and efficient West Point officer (afterwards major- 
general), was in charge of the Capitol extension, 
and had under him over one hundred mechanics, 
many of them Northern men. He had lately called 
on me in response to an introductory letter from 
Captain W. H. Swift. As a last resource, I had a 
free conference with him, and he agreed to be on 
hand early with his workmen on the day of count 
ing the votes, and to make sure that no body of 
conspirators was collecting in the halls or corridors 
of the Capitol, with every inch of which he and 
his men were familiar. The day passed without 
disturbance, and my story is only interesting as 
showing one of the many alarms of the period. 

"Just before the 4th of March our Peace Con 
gress adjourned. It had met with all sorts of criti 
cisms, and little praise. The Tribune, I think, 
called it a convocation of old hens sitting on a nest 
of eggs, some of which would hatch out vipers, 
while most were addled. The rebels of all hues, 
from copper-colored to deep black, abused the Mas 
sachusetts delegation without stint, laying upon us 
the blame of defeating all chance of peace. When 
my old friend Erastus Corning, during the war, 
charged upon my devoted head the whole sin of 
bringing on the war, which he said I might have 
averted by influencing to compromise the Massa 
chusetts delegation, I begged him to give me a cer 
tificate to that effect, promising to have it framed 
handsomely and handed down as an heirloom for 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 201 

my descendants to boast of ! Corning was a strong 
Democrat, and the leader of the New York delega 
tion." 

Mr. Charles Sedgwick s 1 comment on the con 
vention is as follows : 

" It is supposed that your convention will proceed 
to save the country at two o clock precisely, and 
will immediately proceed in a body to the Patent 
Office and patent the process. It is supposed that 
it will sell well in Mexico and Central America." 

It is a twice-told tale, that of the opening of 
the war. The rush of feeling through the North 
can only be understood when one realizes that for 
years the people of that section had been forced by 
political divisions at home to accept compromise 
after compromise with the slave power, which like 
the horse-leech s daughter was ever crying, " Give, 
give ! " The sight of leaders perpetually knocking 
under to their opponents, and all for political cold 
scraps and bare bones, is not one that makes any 
people s temper the milder ; and the incessant kicks 
(undoubtedly invited by the Northern concessions) 
which all Southern newspapers and speakers felt at 
liberty to administer, openly to their enemies, cov 
ertly to their allies, at the North, had bred a spirit 
of bitterness scarcely to be conceived of in these 
days when our orators " sprinkle battlefields with 
rose-water." 

No wonder, then, that the news of a Southern 

1 Representative from New York State. 



202 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

attack on a United States fortress had only to be 
flashed through the North to fuse all differences 
and set ablaze the fire so long smouldering. Many 
Northern people had no clear conception of the 
evils of slavery, nor were all aware that this in 
herited curse was at the bottom of the strife, but 
all understood an attack on the Union. 

I find among my father s papers an article which 
appeared in the " Louisville Courier " just after the 
first battle of Bull Run. When it is recollected 
that it was one of many similar in character, it can 
be readily conceived what sort of feeling articles 
such as this excited in the North. We trust that 
we can laugh at such effusions now ; then the effect 
was serious enough. 

" This has been called a fratricidal war by some, 
by others an irrepressible conflict between freedom 
and slavery. We respectfully take issue with the 
authors of both these ideas. We are not the bro 
thers of the Yankees, and the slavery question is 
merely a pretext, not the cause of the war. The 
true irrepressible conflict lies fundamentally in the 
hereditary hostility, the sacred animosity, the eter 
nal antagonism between the two races engaged. 

" The Norman cavalier cannot brook the vulgar 
familiarity of the Saxon Yankee, while the latter 
is continually devising some plan to bring down 
his aristocratic neighbor to his own detested level. 
Thus was the contest waged in the old United 
States. So long as Dickinson doughfaces were to 
be bought, and Cochrane cowards to be frightened, 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 203 

so long was the Union tolerable to Southern men ; 
but when, owing to divisions in our ranks, the 
Yankee hirelings placed one of their own spawn 
over us, political connection became unendurable, 
and separation necessary to preserve our self-respect. 

" As our Norman kinsmen in England, always a 
minority, have ruled their Saxon countrymen in 
political vassalage up to the present day, so have 
we, the slave oligarchs, governed the Yankees 
until within a twelvemonth. We framed the Con 
stitution, for seventy years moulded the policy of 
the government, and placed our own men, or 
6 Northern men with Southern principles, in power. 

" On the 6th of November, 1860, the Puritans 
emancipated themselves, and are now in violent in 
surrection against their former owners. This insane 
holiday freak will not last long, however, for, das 
tards in fight, and incapable of self-government, 
they will inevitably again fall under the control of 
the superior race. A few more Bull Kun thrash 
ings will bring them once more under the yoke as 
docile as the most loyal of our Ethiopian chat 
tels. " 

To return to my father s notes as to what was 
happening in Massachusetts : 

" At this time Governor Andrew was getting his 
four thousand soldiers overcoats, which was con 
sidered as taking a great responsibility. I need not 
say that I encouraged him in this, and every other 
measure of prompt preparation, and when the call 
for troops came on Monday, the 14th of April, by 



204 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

telegraph, it will be remembered that he was the 
first to respond, and that on Tuesday he had al 
ready collected in Boston three or four regiments 
reasonably well prepared to march, and not merely 
a paper force. 

" On the 12th or 13th of April, when we heard 
of the actual attack going on against Fort Sumter, 
I had under my charge a steamer bound for China, 
which had been disabled in a gale off Hatteras, and 
had reached Norfolk with her rudder crippled. I, 
of course, considered Norfolk an enemy s port, and 
at once telegraphed Captain Morris (agent of the 
underwriters) to go thither without delay from New 
York and get the vessel out at all hazards, which 
he did ; taking her into Baltimore, however, which, 
as it was on the point of rising up for the rebels, 
I considered little better than Norfolk. So my 
partner, E. J. Hale, went to Baltimore ; and some 
how he got her out of that port on the morning of 
the 19th of April, the day they were firing on our 
troops in the streets of that city." 

It was to this action that Wendell Phillips, in one 
of his invectives in 1867, referred as follows : 

" If this government had been as wise as the 
merchant in his counting-room we should have 
saved to the treasury $2,000,000,000; and two 
hundred thousand men who are sleeping in honor 
able graves would now be living. A merchant in 
our city had a vessel at Norfolk, Va., when the war 
broke out, and the first thing he did was to tele 
graph, * Bring my ship north of Mason and Dixon s 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 205 

line. And they brought her. He saved his vessel. 
But the Secretary of the Navy heard the first gun, 
and he thought of his office, of red tape, of some 
body doing this, and the other body doing that, 
and he left $3,000,000 worth of ships there and 
the Confederacy took them. Now, I call that mer 
chant a statesman ; and I call that Secretary of the 
Navy a fool." 

To return to the "merchant s " memories of those 
times : 

" When Sumter was fired upon I was already in 
close rapport with Governor Andrew, going to the 
state house daily and acting as adviser, or clerk, 
or better still as physician by carrying off the gov 
ernor to dine, a ceremony he was ready to postpone 
until midnight, unless some friend captured him 
for this purpose. While waiting for him one day 
I heard an insatiate office-seeker insist on having 
five minutes. My time, said Governor Andrew, 
( is taken up every moment (looking at his watch) 
until midnight. Say five minutes after twelve 
to-night, said the enemy, and I 11 wait. 

" Perhaps my connection with vessels and rail 
roads led the governor to put into my hands the 
first arrangements for moving the troops South, for 
which we were expecting orders. The course pur 
sued in making these arrangements shows how small 
an amount of red tape was needed, at a pinch, in 
those early days of the war. The letters from Gen 
eral Scott to the governor had indicated an all-rail 
route to Baltimore for the two regiments destined 



206 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

for the relief of Fortress Monroe. But I remem 
bered well President Felton s warning as to the in 
tentions of the rebels to burn his bridges, and I 
saw the danger of any delay in garrisoning Fortress 
Monroe, then held by old Colonel Dimmick with 
only a couple of small companies of regulars of 
about sixty men each, hardly enough to man the 
gates, much less the ramparts. Seeing the impor 
tance of using water conveyance I took my brother, 
Captain Forbes, into my counsels, and drove with 
him to the chart store for a large chart of the coast 
of the Chesapeake (which nearly filled the cab), 
then to the state house, to show the governor the 
absurdity of trusting to hiring steamers in a half 
rebel city like Baltimore, even if we got the troops 
through to that place without interruption. He 
was beset by crowds on all sides. After studying 
the map and General Scott s letter, and hearing our 
arguments, he quickly said, f We will take the re 
sponsibility and send them direct by water. So we 
made all arrangements to send this important rein 
forcement by sea, one regiment from Boston direct, 
the other from Fall Kiver. I had first, however, 
passed on to Colonel Keyes, who was superintend 
ing the movement of troops at General Scott s head 
quarters in New York, President Felton s suggestion 
as to the water route."

Then followed telegrams for transport :

" To COLONEL BORDEN OR BOAT AGENT, Fall Eiver : 
" On what terms will you send eight hundred 
Massachusetts volunteers hence by rail, and by your

fort ? How much more, if required, thence to 
Annapolis or Washington, government warranting

camp equipage included. Leave here to-morrow 
morning. Answer immediately. 

" J. M. FORBES. 

" Massachusetts was so quick in collecting her 
quota, that the troops were waiting several hours in 
Boston before any actual orders came to dispatch 
them. 

" Tuesday, April 16th, was a stormy easterly day, 
and I had stayed in town for a dinner party (prob- 



208 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

ably at Horace Gray s, in Summer Street). I had 
already got the terms of one of the Baltimore 
steamers (the S. K. Spaulding); but we had given 
up any expectation of orders for that day, it be 
ing after four p. M., when I felt a hand on my 
shoulder as I sat writing in my little den at the City 
Exchange, and heard Colonel Henry Lee s voice 
he was then on Governor Andrew s staff saying, 
The orders have come, we must send off the first 
troops to-night. I sprang to the window to see 
what the weather was, and said at once, It is too 
late to start to-night in this storm. I sent, how 
ever, a messenger to Colonel Borden by the five 
p. M. train, and then hunted up George B. Upton, 
and got him started out to hurry up the Spaul 
ding, then lying in Boston. Having completed the 
arrangements with the Fall River steamer, State of 
Maine, as far as was possible that night, I went to 
the dinner party. 

" I find the following telegram of the next day 
in my book :

" That afternoon (Wednesday the 17th), we got 
off one regiment by the Spaulding, and, by an extra 
train, the other for Fall River, where it was shipped 
by the State of Maine, with my old friend, Captain 
Oliver Eldridge (formerly commander of the clipper 
Coquette), put in charge. 1 Another regiment was 
sent by land route, marching in fine order through 
New York, where it produced a great effect in giv 
ing confidence and spirit to the people by such a 
show of promptness. 

1 Captain Eldridge says in a letter dated November, 1898 : " A 
telegram came, asking me to take command of the State of Maine, 
but not until long afterwards did I know that Mr. Forbes had sug 
gested that I should be chosen for the duty." ED. 



210 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

" In one particular of this relief of Fortress Mon 
roe red tape was allowed to prevail, and might well 
have caused the failure of the expedition. That 
Wednesday morning, while the troops were getting 
ready to take the Fall River train, I occupied myself 
at the governor s room in drawing up instructions 
to Captain Eldridge about the voyage, urging haste, 
and suggesting certain precautions as to having 
guns loaded, and looking out for interruptions when 
he approached the Chesapeake, where the rebels, by 
an armed steamer from Richmond, might easily 
intercept them. I had got the orders into shape 
when unluckily one of the governor s aides, who was 
somewhat of a martinet, and a student in military 
affairs, intercepted me. What ! said he, put our 
troops under the orders of the transport captain ! 
It is against all military rule, and will never do. It 
is utterly irregular ! The orders must go to the 
colonel of the regiment. 9 This colonel happened 
to be an entirely inexperienced militia officer, while 
Captain Eldridge was one of the finest sailors who 
ever trod a deck, true as steel, and full of courage 
and decision. It was all sound red tape doctrine 
that had been spoken ; I could only wish that that 
aide had been in some hotter place ; and though 
it went against my stomach, with my customary 
flexibility I gave up my common-sense plan, and 
accordingly addressed the orders to the militia col 
onel. Mark the result. Captain Eldridge steamed 
to New York to coal up, with only 450 men aboard, 
a number much below the steamer s real capacity, 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 211 

when the rough water disturbed some of their im 
aginations. A council of war was called, and the 
country doctor who acted as surgeon gave the sage 
opinion that the steamer was overloaded. So she 
waited further orders in New York. On my arrival 
in town I was greeted with a telegram from Colonel 
Borden, giving me this news. This time the red 
tape was cut roughly, in the unmistakable terms of 
the governor s order through me : 

" BOSTON, April 18, 1861. 

" COLONEL BORDEN, 70 West Street, New York : 

" Have seen governor and adjutant-general. No 
further orders for Colonel Packard. Push steamer 
on without stopping. Massachusetts must be first 
on the ground. Telegraph when she passes Sandy 
Hook ; also weather. J. M. FORBES. 

" The State of Maine continued on her way, ar 
riving at the fort the next morning, to the great 
joy of Colonel Dimmick, a fine old West Point 
soldier, who, it is said, almost shed tears on seeing 
the reinforcements pour in upon his ill-defended 
post, the most strategic point on our whole coast, 
commanding as it did the entrance to Baltimore, 
Washington, and Richmond. 

" The Spaulding, from Boston, arrived safely, 
after the State of Maine. Captain Eldridge related 
that while disembarking his troops the Virginia 
planters expressed great indignation at seeing the 
sacred soil thus trampled upon by ( Lincoln s hire- 



212 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

lings/ and told him, with ominous shakings of the 
head, that they would never go back home. No/ 
replied Eldridge ; we like the looks of the country 
down here, and we never intend to let it go. 

" After unnecessary delay, one of the regiments 
was put on board the frigate Powhatan, and reached 
the navy yard, Portsmouth, opposite Norfolk, after 
dark, and just too late to prevent the scuttling of 
the frigate Merrimac." 

Work at high pressure continued for my father. 
He took the part of deputy commissary of Massa 
chusetts, as will be shown by the following letters 
and notes. The first is amusing, from Governor 
Andrew s terse indorsement. Time was precious 
just then. 

(Private.) BOSTON, April 23, 1861. 

To His EXCELLENCY, JOHN A. ANDREW : 

My dear Sir, To give you an idea of the time 
it will take to get good hard bread for shipping : 
I should think for a month s supply to our Massa 
chusetts troops now in the field it would need at 
least three days from the time the order was given 
to do it properly possibly more. 

Other things can be had quicker, but I should 
like, if you think proper, to have an order by the 
bearer to provide a month s supply of hard bread 
for 4000 men. By the time this is ready you 
will have plenty of troops here and an order for 
them, and with the bread can send other things to 
match. 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 213 

I don t want to interfere with the duties of your 
commissary-general that is to be, but some things 
take time, and bread ought to be ordered to-day. 

You cannot be too careful in getting a working 
business man for the commissariat. It will save 
the State thousands of dollars, and save us our 
credit when accounts come to be settled after the 
enthusiasm boils past. 

Yours, J. M. FORBES. 

At your Excellency s request the Committee on 
the Militia have considered the within proposition. 
We unanimously recommend that Mr. Forbes be au 
thorized to purchase forthwith provisions for 4000 
for thirty days, more or less, and that arrangements 
be made to forward them promptly. 

HUGH W. GREENE, 
JOHN I. BAKER, 
OAKES AMES, 
Committee on Militia. 
Let it be done. J. A. ANDREW. 

The notes continue : 

"I find among my files a curious illustration of 
the enthusiasm with which the first troops going 
South were regarded by their fellow-citizens, and 
the almost motherly thought taken by the author 
ities for their comfort. Here is an extract from a 
letter dated April 27th, 1861, addressed to the ad 
jutant-general by a committee on behalf of the 
* Occupants of Quincy Market/ who had learned 



214 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

that a private firm had offered to furnish a shipload 
of ice for the troops, and proposed &lt;to furnish a 
quantity of fresh meats to be packed in said ice, 
for the benefit of said troops. This must have 
been referred to me by the governor, for I find that 
on the 2d of May, in advising him of my having 
got the refusal (at $1000 for a month) of a vessel 
to take about 300 tons of ice to Fort Monroe and 
Washington, I let him know that I could pack the 
provisions on it and would so arrange it, if he said 
Go ahead ; and that he said this accordingly on 
the flyleaf of my letter, only suggesting that the 
market men should ( give part in vegetables instead 
of meat. His next note to me is so characteristic 
that I cannot refrain from giving it entire : 



"COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS. 

" Executive Department. Council Chamber. 
" BOSTON, May 20, 1861. 

" MY DEAR SIR, I wish you would have some 
of Baker s chocolate sent on the Pembroke for our 
troops at Fort Monroe. Some ask for it, and would 
regard this change as a luxury and an advantage. 
" Yours faithfully, J. A. ANDREW. 

" And a few dried apples. 

" It need scarcely be observed that in all such 
matters we very soon came down to hardpan. 

"My duties as quartermaster soon became un 
necessary, as the governor succeeded in getting the 
services of Colonel E. D. Brigham for this sort of 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 215 

work, but I found abundant occupation in buying 
ships and doing what I could in the way of help 
ing to give the proper direction to public opinion. 
About this time I suggested the expediency of buy 
ing a couple of steamers for transporting our troops, 
and (the legislature not being in session and no 
money appropriated for such naval operations) we 
raised a subscription among the Boston merchants 
for half the needful amount and the banks ad 
vanced the other half to the governor ; and so in 
partnership with the State we bought the steamers 
Cambridge and Pembroke, borrowed guns from the 
navy yard, and fitted them up as transports. The 
railroads were at this time broken up between Phila 
delphia and Washington, hardly a mail going, and 
telegraphing very uncertain ; and for a while the 
merchants of Boston and New York cooperated 
with the commanders of the navy yards in both 
places, and did a good deal towards pushing the 
outfit of vessels from the navy yards. I think I 
may have had some sort of authority at this time 
from headquarters, but am sure I met ready help 
from Commodore Hudson, who was then at the 
head of the Charlestown Navy Yard, and some 
times stretched the red tape rather largely." 

As an illustration of an emergency of those days 
which had to be dealt with on the spur of the 
moment, I give my father s instructions to the cap 
tain of the Cambridge while she was still in the 
service of the State of Massachusetts : 



216 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

BOSTON, July 13, 1861. 
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS, Steamer Cambridge, Hyannis : 

Dear Sir, Commodore Hudson sends Lieu 
tenant Stevens by this train to represent the gov 
ernment on board Cambridge, and take charge of 
any warlike operations, but he will doubtless con 
sult with you about the cruise generally. 

You will receive a new twelve-pound rifle by the 
train, with ammunition ; also some preserved meats. 

Then get, if you can and think best, ten to twenty 
good men for the cruise. 

Follow Lieutenant Stevens s orders, if he comes. 
If he misses from any cause, get somehow, by pur 
chase or otherwise, enough coal for a cruise of five 
or six days with what you have got, and run out 
about northeast and cruise on the north edge of the 
Gulf in search of privateers take the responsi 
bility carefully, of hailing vessels, and if you find 
one that you feel sure is a privateer or pirate, take 
her, or better still sink her, but be sure you are 
right before you fire. 

I have little doubt the lieutenant will reach you. 
I have a telegram from Secretary Welles authoriz 
ing me to send you on a two or three days cruise 
after the privateer. The best chance for catching 
her will be at the northeast, on the track of vessels 
bound to New York from Europe. She was last 
seen Monday night, about one hundred miles south 
east from Nantucket ; has had light southerly winds 
since. She is a full-rigged brig, of about 200 
tons, formerly the Echo, slaver, has been showing 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 217 

French flag, has cotton foresail and top-gallant 
sails, hemp trysail. Has three jibs and staysail, 
about seventy men, Captain Coxetter, First Lieuten 
ant Postell, said to be formerly of Texan navy, one 
eighteen-pound pivot gun, four thirty-two or twenty- 
four, and all old guns, no rifled cannon. 

There have been two revenue cutters sent from 
here and United States sloop Vincennes, also sev 
eral vessels from New York, all intending to cruise 
to eastward of Nantucket. Your best chance will 
therefore be further north. The Secretary s direc 
tions are to cruise for two or three days, but if you 
get any information which leads you to hope for 
success, you must cruise longer. 

We shall have troops to send by you about 
Thursday. Return to Boston after your cruise. I 
have telegraphed Captain John Eldridge to engage 
coal and men for you at Hyannis conditionally. 
See newspapers for particulars about pirates. 

Yours, J. M. FORBES. 

As an illustration of the great dislike my father 
felt for those who affected cheap newspaper noto 
riety, I give his directions, written while he was prac 
tically in charge of Massachusetts naval affairs, to 
W. P. Lee, apparently commanding the Massachu 
setts steamship Pembroke : 

July 13, 1861. 

In a quiet way the Pembroke should hail vessels, 
and warn them, and get information as to the Jeff 
Davis. See description of her in my letter book. 



218 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

If you meet with a pirate, you have a right to 
take her, provided you are sure, but let us have 

no swaggering a la G . If anybody on board 

writes bragging letters that get into the papers, I 
will use my influence to get him on the outside of 
her. If she can really do something, she will get 
talked of enough, but talk alone is of no good. 

No harm in a little deviation from the straight 
track. Remember there are many cruisers out after 
pirates besides yourselves. Try to telegraph us 
from Fort Monroe, when we may expect you, and 
look out for telegraph hence via Baltimore. 

Don t waste your new shells twenty -four pounds. 
Truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 

To return to my father s memories of this early 
part of the war : 

" I however only acted as secretary of the navy 
for Massachusetts for a very short time, as it was 
entirely irregular for the State to own transports, 
and indeed only thought of for a temporary expe 
dient. So we soon sold the Cambridge to the 
United States, and, the Pembroke being too small, 
sold her to R. B. Forbes and others for China; and 
she carried, under John A. Cunningham, the only 
letter of marque issued during the rebellion. 

" My letter books and telegrams show many 
alarms about rebel privateers on the coast, and 
others fitting out in Canada. I had to take a lead 
in overhauling the well or ill founded reports, and 
sometimes to try and intercept the vessels, but I 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 219 

find nothing really worth recording. Once, in my 
absence. Jack Hale 1 was roused up in the night by 
a telegraphic message from Mr. Seward to me sug 
gesting getting the navy yard to send a cruiser to 
the St. Lawrence to try and intercept a rebel pirate 
thought to be fitting out at Montreal ; but there 
were only slow old sailing ships available, and I 
knew too much of the thirty-mile-wide Gulf of St. 
Lawrence to send such vessels on a wild goose 
chase ; and so confined myself to investigating the 
facts through our consuls. In this case I believe it 
all grew out of the desire of some Canadian steam 
ship owner to frighten us into buying his vessel in 
Canada." 

I give a few of my father s letters of this period 
mainly as showing his reasons for urging the im 
portance of a volunteer navy, and partly as indicat 
ing the other subjects of public interest which were 
engaging his attention : 

J M. FOKBES TO THE " NEW YORK EVENING POST." 

A short sentence in the telegraph is suggestive 
about Cuba : No more American ships can get 
charters. 

This does not apply to Cuba alone. The loss by 
these miserable pirates, in freight and in insurance 
premiums, is already ten times what it would cost 
to have prevented them by a little forecast on the 
part of government. 

Next will come a complication with foreign powers 

1 E. J. Hale, his partner. 



220 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

about efficiency of blockade, then encouragement of 
rebels, and loss of lives and treasure indefinite. 

If the government will not act, or Congress, they 
must be pushed on by the press. Fifty sail of ves 
sels should be got to sea before the 1st of August. 
Blockading, they will be valuable, and as cruisers ; 
but still more for showing the rebels, and their 
friends in Europe, that we intend to seal them up. 

Governments are always timid about new mea 
sures without precedents. Let the press and the 
people speak, and government must follow ; but no 
time is to be lost. Congress must authorize the 
needful action. 

It is a poor measure, a half measure, to turn this 
over to the Treasury with their miserable revenue 
cutters. It belongs to the navy, and should be 
placed there. 

J. M. FORBES TO W. H. SEWARD. 

BOSTON, June 12, 1861. 

I have just seen Lothrop Motley (Dutch Repub 
lic), who has landed from the steamer this morn 
ing, and gives very brilliant accounts of our Eng 
lish relations. 

This is all very well while we are strong, and 
there is a prospect of our whipping the rebels before 
the next cotton crop; but I have seen letters from 
well-informed sources, not diplomatic, which have 
another color. 

The aristocratic rulers of England do not like us, 
and the middle classes want cotton, and our safety 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 221 

lies, while talking smoothly of peace, and believing 
all we choose of their fair professions, in taking the 
most vigorous measures to strengthen our navy. 
. . . We can get some weapons forged for those 
domestic enemies which will be useful for foreign 
ones, in case they get hungry for cotton, and try to 
bully us next fall. I hope you will not relax one 
iota for all the peace talk. France will act with 
England if we are caught weak next fall. 

J. M. FOEBES TO T. DAWES ELIOT. 1 

BOSTON, July 4, 1861. 

MY DEAR MR. ELIOT, I have yours of 2d, and 
note the doubts of Mr. Welles as to the safety of 
intrusting commissions to our merchant sailors. 
This is natural at first sight, but a little reflection 
must convince him that it is entirely unfounded. 

During our two wars with England, when most 
of our merchant ships were of 200 to 400 tons and 
none above 700, our best commodores and captains 
came from the merchant service, and showed no in 
aptitude for carrying frigates into action. Look 
over Cooper s " Naval History " and see who won 
the laurels then ! 

If history were wanting as a guide, we should on 
general principles come to the same confidence in 
the skill and gallantry of our merchant sailors. I 
would make no invidious comparisons with our 
navy ; but the crisis is a great one, and the navy 

1 Chairman of the Naval Committee of the House of Representa 
tives. ED. 



222 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

can well afford to face the truth. It has glorious 
men and glorious memories, but they are so closely 
interwoven with those of our merchant marine that 
to lower the one it is almost inevitable that you 
lower the other. If I make a comparison, it is 
partly in the hope of making suggestions that will 
tend to raise the navy to its highest point of effi 
ciency. 

Let us for a moment examine the training of 
the two services now. Leaving out the Annapolis 
school as only just beginning to act upon the very 
youngest grade of commissioned officers, the youths 
intended for the navy have been selected at a very 
early age, with generally very insufficient educa 
tion, from those families who have political in 
fluence, and from those young men who have a 
prejudice against rough sailor life. Under our 
system of promotion by seniority these young men 
live an easy life in the midshipman s mess, the ward 
room, or on shore, with little responsibility and lit 
tle actual work until, at the age of from forty to 
sixty, they get command of a vessel ; they feel that 
they are in the public service for life, and that the 
ones that take the best care of their lives and 
healths are the most sure of the high honors of 
their profession ! Considering their want of early 
training, of active experience, and of stimulus, it is 
only surprising that they are on the whole so fine a 
body of men. 

Compare this training with that of our merchant 
officers. Taken from a class of young men, with 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 223 

somewhat fewer advantages and education, but all 
having access to our public schools, they are sent 
to sea to fight their own way up. Those who are 
capable soon emerge from the mass of common 
sailors (most of them common sailors for life), and 
are tried as mates, etc. They are chosen for their 
daring, their vigilance, their faculty for command 
ing ; and those who prove to have these qualities 
soon get into command. In nine cases out of ten, 
the young American-born sailor who is fit for it 
gets command of a vessel by the time he is twenty- 
five years old, an age when our naval officers have, 
as a rule, had but little experience in navigating 
vessels, and but little responsibility put upon them. 

Instead of the little vessels which our heroes of 
the old wars commanded, you will find these same 
merchant captains in command of vessels ranging 
from 700 tons (a small ship now), up to 1500 and 
2000 tons, some as large as our seventy-fours, many 
as large as our first-class frigates ! It is idle to talk 
of such men not being able to manoeuvre sloops-of- 
war or frigates, either in action or in any circum 
stances where seamanship and daring are needed. 

So much for a comparison of the training of the 
two services ; now for one or two suggestions for 
raising the navy. First, let us go on with the 
naval school and carry its scientific requirements 
and rigid discipline as high as West Point. To go 
further back still ; I would have the candidates for 
the school recommended, not by members of Con 
gress, but by the boards of education of the dif- 



224 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

ferent States, and taken from those who have 
proved themselves the best scholars in our public 
schools, at least a majority of them ; leaving the 
minority to come from those more favored by for 
tune who use the private schools. 

Once in service, I would have our navy actively 
employed in surveying foreign seas and making 
charts, as the English navy is doing to a consider 
able extent. Then let the President have some 
discretion to promote those who by gallantry or sci 
ence distinguish themselves. Finally, a more liberal 
retiring list, and if possible some higher honors in 
the way of titles as a stimulus to our officers. 

Perhaps there is not time for the reform of the 
service, but it is the time for beginning the organ 
ization of our volunteer navy. Do you note that 
the only privateer that we know has been taken 
has been by sailing brig Perry, though another is 
reported by the Niagara ? I could say almost or 
quite as much in favor of half clipper ships, in 
comparison with the ordinary sloop-of-war, as I 
have said of our merchant sailors. Until we be 
come converted to European ideas upon standing 
armies and navies, we cannot think of giving up 
our land or sea militia, and, if we give up privateer 
ing, we must have a substitute with all its strength 
and more. Yours truly, 

J. M. FORBES. 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 225 

J. M. POKBES TO MOSES H. GRIN^ELL. 

BOSTON, July 6, 1861. 

Thank you for your telegram. I wrote you last 
Sunday in substance as follows : 

We arc obliterating party lines, which is all the 
fashion, especially with the Outs. Why not do so 
with state lines? Of all the men who should go 
abroad, Lothrop Motley would do most credit to the 
administration. He was shut off by Adams and 
Burlingame, much to our regret, and to the loss of 
the country. He is a Republican from the start, 
a linguist, and the historian of the day. Now that 
Burlingame has been banished to China, why not 
send Motley to Vienna ? It would be a delicate 
matter for Massachusetts to press, as she has two 
foreign missions, but if the suggestion came from 
you, upon considerations of public interest, I should 
think Mr. Seward would not hesitate to appoint 
him. We have not, outside of London and Sar 
dinia, a very strong representation in Europe, and it 
does strike me this would strengthen the adminis 
tration. 

If you agree with me, and will push it, you can 
do it, and I know it will be applauded, as Mr. 
Irving s appointment, you remember, was univer 
sally. It would be a compliment to literature rather 
than to our State. . . . 

I hope to see Congress organize a mercantile 
navy, and put you at the head of a commission to 
sit in New York, and see to it. Buy clipper ships, 
and commission the captains with good rank for the 
war! 



226 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

The finding of an efficient " aide " for the over 
taxed war-governor of Massachusetts was a matter 
of importance, and this he enforced on General 
Scott s mind by the gift of a salmon ; a cod sent, as 
I guess, with some similar errand, not having ar 
rived in condition to emphasize it. Besides any 
ulterior object, he had an amused sympathy with 
the kind old general s affection for a good din 
ner : 

J. M. FORBES TO LIEUTENANT-GENERAL WTNFIELD 
SCOTT. 

BOSTON, July 3, 1861. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your valued note of July 1st 
is received. It is clear that Neptune owes me a 
grudge in thus making me the innocent reason of 
the first failure you ever experienced in entertain 
ing your friends or enemies ! 

I do not, however, mean to put up with defeat, 
and so try my own ground, the railroad, and send 
a salmon alone, as I find there is some reason to 
fear that his highness, the cod, does not bear trans 
portation, and may hurt the salmon. Possibly, too, 
his Excellency Governor Andrew s fish may have 
had the preference in the ice-chest ! 

I hear that our good governor has turned his 
face toward "Washington. He is killing himself 
with attention to military details, and if you value 
him or Massachusetts, I wish you could send him 
some good army officer to help him organize our 
last ten thousand men. 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 227 

This learning the art of war in two months is a 
serious matter ! 

With my best wishes and respects. 

Yours truly, J. M. FORBES. 

My father s only reference to the first great bat 
tle of the war is in some reminiscences of Wendell 
Phillips, and reads as follows : 

" On the Sunday of the first Bull Run I heard 
W. H. Channing 1 preach, and made up off-hand a 
little party for the next day, Monday, at Milton, 
including James Freeman Clarke, W. H. Channing, 
and Mr. Phillips. Governor Andrew was ill at Hing- 
ham, so that I could not get him ; and I forget 
who the others were. When they came out they 
brought out the worst story of Bull Run, looking 
almost like the capture of Washington. It was a 
sad feast ; Channing almost cried, and all were in 
the depths except Phillips, who stoutly insisted that 
it was just what we wanted, and was perhaps the 
best thing that could have happened ; and he was 
probably right." 

The notes continue : 

" I find that on the 9th of July I sent Mr. Eliot 
my rough draft of the ( Bill for a Volunteer Navy/ 
which was afterwards carefully drawn up by Mr. 
R. H. Dana. The bill empowered the government 
to purchase and arm vessels and give commissions to 
merchant captains and others on them, to appoint 
three commissioners of the volunteer navy to organ- 

1 Then lately arrived from England. 



228 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

ize a bureau at Washington to take charge of the 
new business ; and it gave a $3,000,000 appropria 
tion to carry out its provisions. The bill was passed 
later on, but meanwhile I had been put on a com 
mission, with Commodore Hudson, of the navy 
yard at Charlestown, and J. C. Delano, of New 
Bedford, to buy merchant ships for the navy, fit 
them for sea ready for their armament, and also to 
nominate from the merchant service captains, and 
perhaps other officers, to command them. We 
bought several ships, among which I remember the 
Fear not, Captain Faucon." 

During his work in ship-buying my father s dis 
gust was extreme to find that a Boston firm had got 
wind, through some leaky official in the Navy De 
partment, of his intended purchases. He writes of 
this firm to Assistant Secretary Fox as follows : 

" I think they will cost the department some 
thousands besides the delay. One vessel that has 
been, I hear, offered at $25,000 is held firmly at 
$30,000 and ought to have been bought at $20,000 
to $24,000. Others are stimulated by these people 
to offer at high prices, having first been led to pro 
mise and a commission if they sell to gov 
ernment. Of course, government has thus to pay 
not for help, but for hindrance. . . . Better far, if 
Messrs. and have any claim on the depart 
ment, authorize us to pay them a commission to help 
us, conditional on their doing so, than let them 
exact a commission, practically from us, for hurting 
our negotiations." 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 229 

And he says in another letter to Fox of this 
period : 

" We are still embarrassed by the sharks, who 
have forestalled us with the vessels we think we 
must have ; and by a singular coincidence, your 
naval constructor H. can see very little good in any 
vessel except those thus forestalled. The others 
are too large or too small, or too deep or too shoal, 
and our good friend Commodore Hudson is very 
shy of going against the established navy dimen 
sions. So in my animosity against the speculators 
I make scant headway, as I will not see the govern 
ment fleeced until the emergency becomes greater." 

My father recalls in his notes still another form 
of stealing which he unearthed in the five weeks 
during which he served on the commission : 

" Feeling the urgency for haste, I had the King 
Fish 1 thoroughly fitted out by Mr. David A. Green, 
an experienced merchant and shipowner, with all 
the substantiate of rigging and spars needed for 
two or three years, and had her towed round to 
the Charlestown Navy Yard to receive her arma 
ment and crew, the receiving ship being full of 
sailors waiting for vessels. To my disgust, some 
weeks later I found her still at the navy yard, and 
upon inquiry I found that nearly all the New Bed 
ford outfitting had been ignored, and new spars, 
rigging, and other outfit put in. I satisfied myself 
that somebody around the navy yard got a commis 
sion or steal for all this, and though it could not 

1 A new clipper just bought by the commission. ED. 



230 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

be proved without a court-martial and perhaps civil 
trial, I reported the facts to Mr. Fox, assistant 
secretary of the navy, and these, with other similar 
occurrences, called his attention to the urgent need 
of reform. 

" He quietly got Congress to pass a bill provid 
ing that thereafter contractors and others furnish 
ing supplies for the navy should become employees 
of the department, and subject to court-martial ; 
and under this new regime he remedied many of 
the abuses which had grown up, and came near 
getting some very sanctimonious thieves put into 
the penitentiary. 

" What was done in New England in the way of 
buying ships was on rather a small scale, as very 
much the larger number were bought in New York 
and the other Middle States, through the agency of 
a relative of Mr. Welles, an honest and fairly good 
business man, who on the whole did his work very 
well, although he made the mistake of receiving 
a percentage from the shipowners. Neither he nor 
the Secretary could see that the commission paid 
him by the sellers was really to come out of the 
government instead of out of the sellers ; so he 
made, it was thought, about $100,000, at the cost 
of some scandal against Welles and against the ad 
ministration ; but it was done openly and public 
opinion was not enough instructed to appreciate 
fully the mischief, which was really much greater 
than for the government to have paid him a large 
commission. 



THE BEGINNING OF WAR 231 

" We of the Massachusetts commission had, of 
course, asked no charges, except for our actual trav 
eling expenses, and I incline to think that even 
these were borne by us. In railroad matters, it had 
always been an axiom that a commission paid by a 
seller to an employee of the company was the worst 
form of stealing, for the seller not only added the 
commission to his price, but it, being a secret ar 
rangement, was liable always to cover bad quality 
and bad measure. The same holds good of govern 
ment transactions. Gideon Welles was an honest 
old Democratic editor, who knew but little of busi 
ness, and who could not see the point that whatever 
the seller of the ship paid the agent of the govern 
ment for buying his ship was not only an addition 
to the price, but was a bribe to the agent to shut 
his eyes as to the quality of the thing purchased." 

I add a letter from Mr. Fox, from which it would 
appear that his correspondent was required to be 
responsible for officers as well as ships : 

G. V. FOX TO J. M. FORBES. 

NAVY DEPARTMENT, July 30, 1861. 

SIR, I notice your letter to the Secretary of 
July 27. I think the Rover better be fitted for a 
long cruise towards the line, where her steam might 
enable her to pick up a privateer in calm latitudes. 
You must send forward nominations for all the 
officers, or there will be delay. . . . Let us have the 
officers at once. The department will buy no ships 
east of New York, except through your board, and 



232 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

any other parties have no countenance from here. 
If the board jump clear of them, their act will be 
approved. We mean to have you act unfettered, 
to the best of your judgment, but I should try to 
keep inside of 1100 tons. . . . 

Very truly yours, G. V. Fox. 



CHAPTER IX 

THE CONDUCT OF THE WAB 

THE commission for buying ships was dissolved 
on August 30, 1861, and just before that date my 
father writes to C. F. Adams, United States min 
ister to London, stating his objection to Seward s 
proposition to give up privateering. He held that 
we must keep the right to privateer as a threat, not 
to be used except in extremity : 

J. M. FOKBES TO CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS. 

BOSTON, August 12, 1861. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have been hard at work for 
some weeks upon the organization of the new vol 
unteer navy, and although it will be made an aux 
iliary, and a very useful one, to the navy, I regret to 
say I find great difficulties in giving it that effi 
ciency which it ought to have, as a substitute for 
privateering. I am of course not going to give it 
up, and am looking to such changes in our law as 
will doubtless be adopted whenever an emergency 
really puts us to our trumps ; but while it is yet 
an experiment, I am satisfied that we ought not to 
give up our right to issue letters of marque unless 
accompanied by Mr. Marcy s broader principle of 



234: JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

exempting all private property on the sea from 
capture. 

Even then I consider the time an unlucky one, 
and hope that some happy accident or some un 
reasonable demands on the part of the European 
powers may enable us to postpone the whole ques 
tion. I need not, I hope, assure you that I have 
no disposition to interfere with your duties beyond 
giving you at the earliest moment the result of my 
personal observation upon the experiments we are 
trying now, and which of course has a direct bear 
ing upon the questions which you are perhaps now 
discussing. 

Pray make my best regards to Mrs. Adams and 
the rest of your family, and believe me, 
Truly yours with high respect, 

J. M. FORBES. 

N. B. Our hope was (and still is) to make the 
volunteer navy equally strong for attack without 
the barbarism of privateering, but it is by no means 
so easy a task as we had supposed. 

Mr. Adams answered my father s letter of August 
12, as follows : 

CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS TO J. M. FORBES. 

LONDON, 30 August, 1861. 

I do not know that I violate any confidence by 
telling you that the hope expressed in yours to me 
has been thus far verified. What the future may 
bring forth, no man can tell, but the fact is cer 
tain that, now, negotiation is at a standstill. 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 235 

I hear excellent accounts of your patriotic labors 
in the cause, and hope the best results from them. 
The great point now is the blockade. Privateering 
will come to nothing if that be made effective. If 
not, I see no end to it. For some of our own peo 
ple would be as likely to go into it as to carry on 
the slave trade. The English must abide by the 
blockade, if it really be one- They will set it aside 
if they can pick a good flaw in it. 

The course of events as seen from here is towards 
one termination of the struggle, and one only. We 
cannot afford to go over this ground more than 
once. The slave question must be settled this time 
once for all. It is surprising to see the efforts made 
here to create the belief that our struggle has no 
thing to do with slavery, but that it is all about a 
tariff. Even the anti-slavery people have been more 
or less inclined to give in to this notion. 

Of course the measure of emancipation is a most 
grave one. It must task the capacity of the wisest 
heads among us. But there is no alternative in my 
mind between taking it up and absolute submission. 

I cannot conceal from myself the fact that as a 
whole the English are pleased with our misfortunes. 
There never was any real good will towards us 
and the appearance of it of late years was only the 
effect of their fears of our prosperity and our grow 
ing strength. Of course, you will keep these views 
to yourself. It is not advisable in these days for 
ministers abroad to be quoted. With best regards 
for Mrs. F. and your family, I am 

Very truly yours, C. F. ADAMS. 



236 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Next in order comes a letter from Mr. Bryant to 
my father in answer to a sort of fusilade from him 
expressive of his extreme impatience as to the con 
duct of the War Department : 

WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT TO J. M. FORBES. 

OFFICE OF THE EVENING POST, 
NEW YORK, August 21, 1861. 

MY DEAR SIR, It does not seem to me at all 
indiscreet or imprudent to make the change in the 
Cabinet which you suggest. Indeed, I think that 
Mr. Cameron s retirement would, instead of being 
impolitic, be the most politic thing that could be 
done, by way of giving firmness to public opinion 
and strengthening the administration with the peo 
ple. The dissatisfaction here is as great as with 
you, and I hear that at Washington it is expressed 
by everybody, except Cameron s special friends and 
favorites, in the strongest terms. If I am rightly 
informed, there is nothing done by him with the 
promptness, energy, and decision which the times 
demand, without his being in a manner forced to it 
by the other members of the Cabinet, or the Presi 
dent. A man who wants to make a contract with 
the government for three hundred mules, provided 
he be a Pennsylvanian, can obtain access to him, 
when a citizen of East Tennessee, coming as the 
representative of the numerous Union population 
of that region, is denied. There are bitter com 
plaints, too, of Cameron s disregard of his appoint 
ments and engagements in such cases as that I have 
mentioned. 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 237 

Mr. Lincoln must know, I think, that Cameron is 
worse than nothing in the Cabinet, and a strong 
representation concerning his unpopularity and un- 
acceptableness, of which he may not know, may 
lead him to take the important resolution of supply 
ing his place with a better man. I do not think 
the newspapers are the place to discuss the matter, 
but I make no secret of my opinion. 
I am, dear sir, truly yours, 

WM. C. BRYANT. 

P. S. I open my letter to say another word 
on the subject of yours. It does not appear to me 
that H. would be the man for the War Department, 
for the reason that he might give us trouble on the 
slavery question. Cameron has managed that part 
of our relations with the seceding States very badly, 
and I feel H. would do no better. He would do 
very well in the place of Smith ; but with the excep 
tion of making a place for him, it might not be of 
much consequence whether Smith were retained or 
not, though he adds no strength to the Cabinet. 
Some here talk of requiring the dismissal of Seward, 
but I fear this would be asking more than it is 
possible to get, and might endanger the success of 
the scheme for getting rid of Cameron. 

W. C. B. 

The following letters show that my father was 
not yet prepared to back the extreme measures of 
his abolition friends : 



238 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

S. G. HOWE TO J. M. FORBES. 

BOSTON, August 19, 1861. 

. . . The public Deed something, or somebody, 
some word, or some blow, to magnetize them, or 
else they will be fearfully demoralized in a month. 
The word must be emancipation, and war upon 
slaveholders as such as a distinct class as the 
authors of all the present ills. 

Can you not confer with the governor about 
this? You cannot keep up public interest, much 
less public enthusiasm, about an abstraction (at least 
of a worldly and temporal nature), and Union is a 
mere abstraction now ; it touches not, and cannot 
touch, the public heart. 

As one blow, I suggest what I vainly suggested 
last spring, an expedition to land in or about 
Albemarle Sound, composed mainly of blacks, who 
would go into the Dismal and other swamps and 
raise the thousands of refugees there to go out and 
make sallies and onslaughts upon the enemy ; and 
so make a diversion. 

It would at least cause a worse than Bull Run 
panic. There are plenty of men in Canada, reso 
lute and intelligent refugees, who would enlist in 
such an enterprise. It cannot, however, be done by 
private means. Can any other be had, think you ? 

I have mentioned the matter of expedition to the 
Dismal Swamp to the governor, but to him only. 
Please not speak of it to any one else. 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 239 

J. M. FORBES TO S. G. HOWE. 

NAUSHON, August 21, 1861. 

MY DEAR DOCTOR, I have yours of the 19th. 
I confess to being one of that average class which 
constitutes the majority of our people, who as yet 
hesitate at the dreadful experiment of insurrection ; 
if it comes as a necessity, an alternative to the sub 
version of republican institutions, we should not 
hesitate a moment. There seem to me three rea 
sons against it at this time, apart from our natural 
shrinking from a measure of this sort upon humane 
grounds. 

1st. It may unite the border States against us, 
and check any tendency to division in the cotton 
States. 

2d. It will, if resorted to from anything but ob 
vious, stern necessity, divide the North. 

3d. Its success as a weapon against the South is 
by no means certain. It is, to my mind, with 
the light of the past four months quiet among the 
blacks, and of John Brown s experience, very un 
certain unless resorted to under favorable circum 
stances. At present it seems to me worth more as 
a weapon to hold in reserve to threaten with, than 
one to strike with. 

If resorted to now it would be in a hesitating, 
uncertain manner by our administration, and from 
that, if nothing else, would be likely to fail. Once 
tried, and failed in, a great source of terror to the 
South and of confidence to the North is lost. 

I go therefore for holding it in reserve until 



240 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

public sentiment, which is the chief motive power 
behind the administration, drives them to use it deci 
sively. Our people throughout have been ahead of 
our government, which has followed rather lag- 
gingly : it is not a leading, but a following ad 
ministration. It does not act, even now, readily 
when first urged by the popular tide. Nothing but 
the full force of the current starts it. If we could 
get a good hurricane to help the tide, it might 
sweep away some of the weaker materials in the 
Cabinet, and possibly put a leader in their place 
who would thenceforward draw after him the Cab 
inet and the people. 

Your suggestion, then, even if it were the best 
thing, seems to me premature. As to urging on 
the government to vigor, to making serious war 
with shot and hemp, there would not, there could 
not, be two opinions with the people. Governor 
Andrew could give the hint to our Massachusetts 
papers, and they would all readily sound the trum 
pet for vigor and for discipline, and the " Evening 
Post " and such papers would readily help. 

As to anything more, or in the direction you 
suggest, I want to see the demand come from the 
people, from the democracy, rather than from either 
the leaders or the abolitionists ! 

Perhaps the poverty of the South may soon begin 
to afflict the slaves, and they may lead off. If they 
do, the responsibility is not ours. 

Very truly yours, JOHN M. FORBES. 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 241 

The War Department continued to be a cause of 
anxiety. My father next writes : 

J. M. FOKBES TO WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT. 

NAUSHON, August 24, 1861. 

Yours of the 21st received. The objection which 
you suggest to Mr. H. is a very strong one. We 
need a man in the War Department who, when the 
right time comes, will not hesitate a moment to 
assail the weakest point of the enemy. Our Gov 
ernor Andrew seemed to me to hit the nail on the 
head when he rebuked Butler for offering to put 
out any fire in the enemy s camp. The time has 
come when we can no longer afford to " make war 
with rose-water/ and it was a great mistake in Con 
gress to limit the confiscation of property to that of 
rebels found in arms against us. All the property 
of open rebels should be forfeited the first week of 
the next Congress ; this would enable us to pro 
claim emancipation in the border States with a fixed 
compensation for all valuable slaves belonging to 
loyal citizens, without a very large bill for Virginia. 

I had hoped that H. was man enough to go in for 
such a measure and advocate it as a boon to the 
loyal citizens of Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and 
Delaware, putting it upon the ground of military 
necessity. If he is not up to this we don t want 
him ; but it is not worth while to try to get rid of 
Cameron without at the same time making quite sure 
of a better man. You remember the old story of 
the trapped fox begging his friend the hawk not to 



242 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

drive off the half-sated swarm of flies only to give 
place to a new cloud of them and hungry ones ? 
I wish you would go a step further, and suggest a 
successor. Is there no one who could take Chase s 
place, and give him the War? I forget whether I 
suggested to you James Joy, of Detroit. He would 
do well for the War, better for the Interior, from 
his thorough knowledge of the West. Lincoln, 
Trumbull, Chandler, and all the Western men know 
him. He is the most able, decided, and plucky man 
that I know. How would Sherman do for the Trea 
sury, and Chase for War? 

As the matter stands now, the effort to displace 
Cameron will be coupled with one to put in H., and 
if the latter is not the right man, we had better 
rub along as we are, until the right man turns up. 
Governor Andrew has all the moral qualities ; but he 
is perhaps too pronounced an anti-slavery man, and 
works too much upon details himself, not using other 
men. He would kill himself in the Cabinet. . . . 

The answer came promptly, and is as follows : 

WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT TO J. M. FORBES. 

OFFICE OF THE EVENING POST, 
NEW YORK, August 27, 1861. 

I do not much like the idea of putting Sherman 
into the Treasury Department. He would make, I 
think, a better secretary of war. The great objec 
tion I have to him in the Treasury Department is 
that, so far as I understand the matter, he is com- 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 243 

mitted, as the saying is, to that foolish Morrill tariff. 
Yet I am very certain that it would be considered 
by the country an immense improvement of the 
Cabinet to place him in the War Department. The 
country has a high opinion of his energy and resolu 
tion and practical character. 

Of Governor Andrew I do not know as much as 
you do, though I have formed a favorable judgment 
of his character and capacity not a very precise 
one, however. . . . 

They talk of H. here as they do with you, but I 
am persuaded that the disqualification I have men 
tioned would breed trouble in the end. The dis 
satisfaction with Cameron seems to grow more and 
more vehement every day. His presence taints the 
reputation of the whole Cabinet, and I think he 
should be ousted at once. I am sorry to say that a 
good deal of censure is thrown here upon my good 
friend Welles, of the Navy Department. He is too 
deliberate for the temper of our commercial men, 
who cannot bear to see the pirates of the rebel gov 
ernment capturing our merchant ships one after 
another and defying the whole United States navy. 
The Sumter and the Jeff Davis seem to have a 
charmed existence. Yet it seems to me that new 
vigor has of late been infused into the Navy Depart 
ment, and perhaps we underrated the difficulties of 
rescuing the navy from the wretched state in which 
that miserable creature Toucey left it. There is a 
committee of our financial men at present at Wash 
ington, who have gone on to confer with the Presi- 



244 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

dent, and it is possible that they may bring back a 
better report of the Navy Department than they 
expected to be able to make. 

Kumor is unfavorably busy with Mr. Seward, but 
as a counterpoise it is confidently said that a mutual 
aversion has sprung up between him and Cameron. 
This may be so. The " Times/ I see, does not spare 
Cameron, nor the " Herald." There is a good deal 
of talk here about a reconciliation between Weed 
and Bennett, and a friendly dinner together, and the 
attacks which the "Herald is making upon the War 
and Navy Department, are said to be the result of 
an understanding between them. Who knows, or 
who cares much ? 

I have emptied into this letter substantially all I 
have to say. There are doubtless men in private 
life who would fill the War Department as well as 
any I have mentioned, but the world knows not 
their merits, and might receive their names with a 
feeling of disappointment. 

P. S. With regard to visiting Naushon, I should 
certainly like it, and like to bring my wife. I have 
another visit to make, however, in another part of 
Massachusetts; but I shall keep your kind invita 
tion in mind and will write you again. 

W. C. B. 

Naval matters interested my father more than 
military, and I find him writing from Naushon, on 
August 31, to his friend Mr. George Ashburner, 
who had left Calcutta and settled in England : 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 245 

"I feel as if I had been very negligent in not 
before thanking you for your most thorough and 
useful data about iron plates, which will be of great 
help to the department when they come to decide 
upon how to build. Ked tape, I fear, is not con 
fined to the Crimea ! And where there are real 
difficulties about the iron plates, and lots of plain 
work to be done in other directions, the plans mature 
slowly ! " 

He then goes on to describe two iron ships still 
on the stocks which could be got at cost by the 
government, and to ask his correspondent to " get 
at the views of some experienced man " as to the 
efficiency of a plan which he had conceived for plat 
ing, and making turrets on these ; and ends a long 
letter with, " We are gradually recovering our self- 
respect, and shall get some good out of much evil/ 
referring to the stampede at Bull Run. 

During the summer and autumn of 1861, prior to 
the seizure of Mason and Slidell, a number of letters 
passed between my father and his old correspondent, 
Nassau Senior. I give some of these as showing 
very forcibly the different points of view of Ameri 
cans and English on the same subject. 

NASSAU W. SENIOR TO J. M. FORBES. 

CHATEAU DE TOCQUEVILLE, August 20, 1861. 

MY DEAR MR. FORBES, I write from a place hi 
which your name is often mentioned, and always with 
great gratitude. Madame de Tocqueville, after an 
illness of thirteen or fourteen years, is better than I 



246 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

have seen her since 1848. The first use that she 
has made of returning strength has been to unite a 
little party of her old friends, the Beaumonts, 
Ampere, and ourselves, and we are passing charm 
ing mornings in walking and driving, and evenings 
in talking and hearing Ampere read Moliere, 
which is better than most acting. 

I find the general opinion in France and in Eng 
land as to your affairs identical. 

It is a general conviction that the secession is one 
of the wildest and wickedest acts that has ever been 
committed ; that you will beat the seceders, but that 
you will not so far conquer them as to make them 
your subjects, or even portions of your federation ; 
that having humiliated and punished them you will 
dictate your own terms on which you will allow 
them to go ; that those terms will probably be that 
you will keep New Orleans and Western Virginia ; 
that you will deprive them of any right to terri 
tories, and probably prohibit their having a slave 
trade. As you are fond of tariffs and have not yet 
found out that they do more harm to the nation 
that makes them than to the nation against which 
they are directed, we suppose that you will enact 
against them a hostile tariff. 

We all bitterly deplore the defeat at Bull s Run, 
believing that it will prolong the war. 

We also think that our conduct to you has been 
perfectly right, and that your complaints of it are 
the childish folly of a democracy which has never 
met with a check before, and like other spoilt chil- 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 247 

dren beats the chair over which it has fallen. You 
will not agree with me, I know, for even your good 
sense has not saved you altogether from participat 
ing in the unreasonableness of those about you. 

The state of this country is painful. France is a 
witch, who has sold herself to the devil, on the con 
dition that he shall give power to hurt others. 
L. N. s offer to her was made to our Saviour, when 
Satan, having shown him all the kingdoms of the 
world and the glory thereof, said, " All this will I 
give thee if thou wilt worship me." 

The indignation, shame, and depression of the 
higher and educated classes is indescribable. 

We intend to wander over the east and south of 
France, and return to England in the beginning of 
October. Kindest regards. 

Ever yours, N. W. SENIOR. 

J. M. FORBES TO NASSAU W. SENIOR. 

NAUSHON ISLAND, September 30, 1861. 

DEAR MR. SENIOR, Your note from the Cha 
teau de Tocqueville reached me a few days since. 
It must have been a most agreeable reunion there. 

We here feel more and more each day the miracle 
of M. de Tocqueville s prophetic vision of our his 
tory. It seems almost like clairvoyance ! Our Chan- 
ning s prevoyance of the results of our Texas land 
thefts is almost as strange. Such men of genius 
may well be called seers. 

I am sorry that you still class me with the crowd 
who always seek to forget their own sins in abusing 



248 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

their neighbors. The fact is, all my prepossessions 
were in favor of England, and I had watched with 
the greatest satisfaction the subsidence of the old 
animosities, growing out of the two wars, and the 
growth of that good feeling which ought to animate 
the two nations who are, or might be, the bulwark 
of free institutions against the despotisms of the 
Old World. 

When we cast off the nightmare despotism, which 
had so long ruled us, the slave oligarchy, which 
sympathized with Russia because of serfdom, and 
dismissed your minister to show their homage to 
the Czar, and which refused you a limited right of 
search, because it favored the slave trade ; in fine, 
when at last we placed ourselves right on the ques 
tion of slavery, which has always been a reproach 
from you to us, I thought the entente cordiale was 
complete. I did not look for material aid nor want 
it, but only such forbearance of countenance to 
wards our " Sepoys " as would help to discourage 
them, and would bring our two nations still more 
into harmony. 

Perhaps I feel the disappointment more bitterly 
than the mob does, because my hope and pre 
judices were strongly for a warm English alliance 
now, I fear, deferred another twenty years. Your 
" Times " I expected nothing better from than we 
have had in its cold sneers at the breaking of our 
bubble of democracy, but from your ministry I did 
look for something better than a proclamation of 
strict neutrality, putting us upon precisely the same 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 249 

footing with our " Sepoys/ forbidding either party 
to bring prizes into your ports, prohibiting your 
subjects aiding either ; and this, too, issued just as 
our new minister was arriving, thus giving him no 
opportunity to confer upon mutual interests \ for I 
contend that it is our mutual interests that have 
been endangered, not ours alone. 

I beg your Sepoys pardon for naming them with 
ours. They at least had foreign conquerors, and 
a hated religion to conspire against, and yet we 
watched your Indian battles with a brother s eye, 
and canonized your Havelocks, Hodsons, and other 
martyrs, as if they had been our own. Even our 
press, loose as it is, uttered no sound of exultation 
at what seemed at one time to be the downfall of 
your Indian empire. 

Had your Sepoys brought a prize into our Cali 
fornia ports, we should have known only the British 
owner, and restored her. Once more I beg your 
Sepoys pardon. They were not guilty of the deep 
crime against their nationality and the principles 
of government which marks our more barbarous 
rebels ! 

One word about the Morrill tariff. It is a la 
bored, clumsy production, and it will fall by its own 
weight. Some of its blunders have been partially 
corrected ; but you mistake the intention of those 
who passed it, or at least of the majority of them. 

Its aim was to substitute the steadiness of spe 
cific duties for the vibrating, cheating system of ad 
valorem. Certain high duties were doubtless smug- 



250 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

gled in under guise of specifics, and the extreme 
difficulty of so framing our specific duties that our 
poorer classes shall not pay the same duties, per 
yard or per pound, on their cheap cloth or tea, will 
probably cause a repeal of the tariff. Yet I think 
British experience and opinion favor the principle of 
specific rather than ad valorem duties. One tends 
to cheat the people who buy the poorest qualities, 
the other tends to enormous frauds against govern 
ment and profits by false swearing, and encourages 
the use of poor, showy goods, as against the more 
substantial ones which come in under specifics. 

You are a little more encouraging as to results 
than you were, but I still think you do not properly 
appreciate the fact that we are not fighting to sub 
jugate the South, but to put down a small class 
who have conspired against the people, and who are 
a thousand times worse enemies of the mass of the 
people at the South than the North. 

The only pinch is our finances. Cannot you help 
us upon the text of the cutting within, if you find 
that sound ? Our moneyed men continue to take 
their tone very much from England, and confident 
views of financial success coming from your side 
have great weight. . . . 

Very truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 251 

NASSAU W. SENIOR TO J. M. FORBES. 

13 HYDE PARK GATE, KENSINGTON, 
November 20, 1861. 

MY DEAR MR. FORBES, I am going to repub- 
lish my articles in Reviews; they will form about 
four volumes. Among them is one, called " Euro 
pean and American State Confederacies/ in which 
I consider whether the American Union be a na 
tional union, or a confederation, whether allegiance 
be due to the State, or to the Union, and I decide 
that it is a national union, and consequently that 
secession is rebellion and treason. Pray look at 
the article : you will find it in the number for Jan 
uary, 1846. But I admit that the question is one 
of difficulty, and that there are great authorities on 
each side. If my opinion on this legal question be 
wrong, if the Union be a mere treaty like the Ger 
man Bund, every American owes allegiance to his 
own State, and if that State secede, he would be 
guilty of rebellion and treason if he did not secede 
too. Now Lord Russell did not feel competent to 
decide this difficult legal question and I think 
that he could not decide it. Yet it is for not de 
ciding it at once, and declaring the seceders rebels, 
that you have been abusing him and us for three 
months. I think that on consideration you will feel 
that the most certain means of destroying our sym 
pathy with the North, and turning it towards the 
South, were your threats that as soon as you had 
settled the affair with the South you would turn on 
us and punish us, by war, for our want of sympathy. 



252 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

One thing has tended much to embitter us, your 
different treatment of France and of us. The con 
duct of the two governments has been identical, 
but you have been as civil to France as you have 
been rude to us. Now I happen to know that the 
French feeling is with the South. They say that 
the New Orleans people are their brethren. They 
are all friends of slavery, and I have peculiar rea 
sons for believing that Louis Napoleon proposed to 
our government to join him in breaking the block 
ade. You know that I have access to accurate 
sources of intelligence, and you may believe this. 
My only wish, from the time that the enormous 
armies and the military success of the South showed 
(at least it so seemed to me) that you might beat, 
but could not conquer her, has been for the ter 
mination of the contest, and as I think that loans 
to either party would tend to prolong it, I own that 
I hope that none will be made. 

We hear little from the South, but the little 
which we do hear leads us to think that you are 
mistaken in believing that there is a strong Union 
party there. They seem to be as determined as you 
are. 

Can you tell me anything of our Sault Ste. Marie 
prospects? I suppose that the war adjourns all 
sales. 

Ever yours, N. W. SENIOR. 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 253 

J. M. FOKBES TO NASSAU W. SENIOR. 

BOSTON, December 10, 1861. 

MY DEAR MR. SENIOR, I have yours of the 20th 
ulto. 

I shall read with much interest your article upon 
the [nature of our government, and am glad you 
came to the same conclusion which everybody here 
long since arrived at except Calhoun and his gang 
of conspirators. 

I don t blame Lord Russell for being puzzled at 
any question which you say has two sides to it ; but 
I do blame him for jumping at his conclusions 
in such hot haste that he could not await the arrival 
of our new minister, whose explanation might have 
given him some light. 

You don t blame the doctor (Medico) when, 
called to a serious case, he happens to take the dark 
view of it, and sentences the patient to "dissolu 
tion ; " but you do think him a blunderer if he 
hastens to tell the victim that he has only to make 
his arrangements for his funeral ! 

Louis Napoleon, by quietly holding back his opin 
ions and then uttering them covered up with sugared 
words, puts himself, with the masses of our people, 
where England was a few months since, our natural 
ally ! Of course it is an enormous humbug, and 
thinking men are not gulled by it, but none the 
less [the situation] operates to inflame the old ani 
mosities that had grown out of two wars and that 
had been just forgotten. 

Another thing must not be forgotten. The 



254 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

French press has not the chance, even when it has 
the will, to do the mischief that yours and ours 
has. We hardly read anything from the French 
papers ; they still less read American papers, and 
this makes the grand difference between our situa 
tion as relating to the two countries. 

You read our New York " Herald " edited by a 
renegade Scotchman . . . and you take it for the 
representative of American journalism ! The " Her 
ald " is really the organ of the seceders, it was so 
openly until after Sumter surrendered ; and only 
came over nominally to the Northern side under the 
terrors of mob law. It has since served its mas 
ters still better by sowing the seeds of dissension 
between us and England. 

We, with perhaps equal blindness, permit the 
" Times " and half a dozen other papers to stand for 
" England." I look for a grand paper duello upon 
the Trent question, and shall be relieved if it goes 
no further. Should the questions assume a warlike 
aspect, we shall only be driven the sooner to our last 
desperate resort, emancipation. We are now only 
divided into two parties at the North, viz.: those 
who would use the negro when we can see no other 
way of conquering ; and secondly, those who would 
use the negro at once, wherever he can be used to 
strengthen us or weaken the enemy ! The logic of 
events has been from day to day settling this ques 
tion, and if our talking men in Congress can only 
be patient or self-denying in the outpouring of pa 
triotic words, we shall go on fast enough. . . . 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 255 

You cannot believe we shall subjugate ten mil 
lions of people. Nor I ; but classify these ten 
millions and all is changed. At least two are 
avowed loyalists in the border States ; four more 
are blacks ready to help us when we will let them ; 
three more are poor whites whose interests are 
clearly with us and against their would-be masters. 
How long will it be before the avowals of their 
masters, aided by the suffering of the war, will 
open their eyes? 

This leaves one million, of all ages and sexes, 
who, through owning slaves and connection with 
slaveholders, may think they have a class interest 
in the success of the rebellion. This class we can 
crush out or what will be left of them after the 
war debt of the rebels reaches its proper value 
whenever we can divide the four million of poor 
whites, by an operation upon their eyes I 

But if I underrate the difficulty, the necessity for 
doing it now is all the greater ! If hard now, how 
much harder will it be after we shall have, as you 
desire, permitted them to separate. Now they have no 
manufactures, no foreign alliances, no warlike stores 
except what they stole from us, and these rapidly 
diminishing. They have missed their first spring in 
which lies the strength of a conspiracy ; while our 
cold Anglo-Saxon blood is just getting roused from 
the lethargy of a long peace and of overmuch 
prosperity. We are just ready to begin to fight. 
We all feel that what is now a war between the 
people and a small class would, after a separation, 



256 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

become a war of sections. As for peace, nobody 
believes it possible ; a truce we might have, to give 
them time to gather breath ! It is only a question 
between war to the end now and a chronic state of 
war with two standing armies, two navies, two corps 
of diplomatists seeking alliances in every court in 
Europe, to end in another death struggle. There is 
no peace for us, unless we either conquer the arro 
gant slave-owner classes who have so long ruled us 
and bullied you, or permit them by a compromise to 
continue and extend their combination with our 
baser class and to drag us into a grand slave empire 
which shall absorb the West Indies and Mexico and 
Central America. 

A bold stand at the polls by the North in 1850 
would have given us the victory peacefully; now 
we must fight for it, or yield to the basest faction 
that ever ruled a country. Better a ten years war 
than this ; but it will not be a long war. 

The conspirators counted upon an early success in 
arms and a division of the North. Foiled in this, 
their only hope is in foreign intervention. I have 
no doubt what you tell me is true of Louis Napo 
leon, still less that he secretly gave the rebels hopes 
of aid, nor that they have construed your course 
to favor them. Had you squarely taken the same 
ground that we did towards your Canadian rebels, 
this hope would have been extinguished ; and now, 
if you want cotton, if you want trade, if you want 
to pave the way to a real alliance with the only free 
nation besides yourselves on the globe, you ought 



THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR 257 

to help us in all legitimate ways. You should 
encourage our loan, you should sharpen your police 
to detect the outfit of hostile vessels, you should 
hold the Nashville strictly accountable for her acts 
of pillage and destruction, giving her the experience 
of a long trial in your courts, if only to discourage 
other pirates from being their own judges of what 
property they may appropriate. 

Do this and the war will be short. Four months 
ago an offer from you to do what we should have 
readily done when your Indian empire was threat 
ened, had it seemed necessary or proper, would have 
ended the war before this, namely, to throw open 
to us for purchase your armories and your ironclad 
shipyards. We might not have accepted the offer, 
but it would have destroyed the rebels last hope. 
I don t complain of your not doing it, but simply 
indicate what for the sake of both countries I wish 
might have been your policy ! 

As for the Sault Ste. Marie, the pine lands must 
wait for the prairie farmers to build again ; but the 
developments in our mineral lands are said to be 
magnificent, and to promise results next summer. 
Very truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 



CHAPTER X 

THE SANITARY COMMISSION 

IN November, 1861, my brother applied for a 
commission in the First Massachusetts Cavalry, and 
my father felt justified in supporting his application 
by the following letter to the governor : 

J. M. FORBES TO GOVERNOR JOHN A. ANDREW. 

BOSTON, November 4, 1861. 

MY DEAR SIR, I beg leave to second my son s 
application for a commission in the First Cavalry 
Regiment, and to say that nothing would induce me 
to seek so perilous an honor for him but a convic 
tion that he is morally and physically well adapted 
to do good service to the good cause. Moreover, I 
know that he is actuated by the highest motives in 
seeking service : such motives as alone can reconcile 
parents to offering their sons ! 

I do not seek for him any specified position, but 
only ask that he should have a chance, before he 
is fixed in the lowest grade, to show whether he is 
fit for anything higher ; in short, that he shall be 
judged by what he can do, rather than by his age, 
which is only just past twenty-one. 

Very truly yours, JOHN M. FORBES. 



THE SANITARY COMMISSION 259 

In due course my brother received his commission 
as lieutenant, and soon afterwards joined his regi 
ment at Readville. 

News came, in the fall of 1861, of the great 
hardships of our men in the Southern prisons, and 
especially at Richmond, where Colonel W. Raymond 
Lee, Paul Revere, and C. L. Peirson were confined. 
Governor Andrew had no appropriation available; 
and the legislature was not in session ; but my 
father offered to send to Richmond whatever sum 
the governor thought best; and accordingly sent, 
through some of his semi-loyal Baltimore friends, a 
draft for $1000, to be paid there to Colonel W. 
Raymond Lee, or Adjutant C. L. Peirson, of the 
Twentieth Massachusetts. This promptly reached 
its destination, and was of great use in mitigat 
ing the situation of many of our officers and men 
who were in want of blankets and other necessaries. 
In due time an act of the legislature was passed 
at the governor s suggestion, reimbursing this out 
lay. 

The seizure of Slidell and Mason came on the 8th 
of November, 1861. This event and all that fol 
lowed are matter of history. On what thin ice the 
two countries had come is manifest by the following 
extract from one of Mr. Ashburner s letters to my 
father : 

" I feel in the deepest anxiety regarding this un 
fortunate affair of the St. Jacinto. I cannot believe 
that anything so horrible as war with the United 
States will result from so inadequate a cause, yet 



260 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

the whole country rings with it ; and as the feeling 
of irritation on your side seems to be equally great, 
I fear that every possible advantage will be taken of 
the passions of two great nations to bring them into 
collision, in spite of their interests, which are so 
deeply involved in the maintenance of peace. That 
the danger is looked upon as most imminent you 
may judge by the course of the government with 
regard to the exportation of saltpetre. The Du- 
ponts, of Delaware, came over here last week and 
cleared the market of that article. They bought 
up the whole stock, some 3000 tons, and were about 
to ship it when the affair of the Trent transpired. 
Within twenty-four hours government laid an em 
bargo upon it, a very extraordinary and extreme 
measure here, where the utmost freedom in trade 
is now the established rule for the country, even 



in war." 



How the Trent affair as a whole appeared to my 
father, after the first excitement of it all had passed, 
will be seen from the following letter : 

J. M. FORBES TO NASSAU W. SENIOR. 

BOSTON, 20 December, 1861. 

Nothing from you lately. You will be glad to 
hear that our people here are within the control 
of the government in regard to the difficulty with 
England, and unless the demands are made in such 
a spirit and manner as to make it seem that war is 
intended sooner or later, we can tide over the pre 
sent trouble. If our government or people are made 



THE SANITARY COMMISSION 261 

to feel that the Trent affair is merely a pretext, and 
that after making disagreeable concessions there, we 
shall only be called upon the sooner to " eat dirt " 
in some other case, we shall of course fight at first, 
coute qu il coute. 

This I do not anticipate, but I hope you states 
men will look ahead beyond the immediate horizon 
and try to treat this case so that it shall not further 
embitter the feelings of the two nations, and thus 
lay the foundations of a future war, whether of 
tariffs or cannon ! 

It will be unfortunate, for instance, if you make 
stringent demands for reparation of a wrong which 
to our common people, and to the common sense of 
the world, will in so large a matter between nations 
look like a technical or legal quibble. 

You cannot convince our people that you are 
justified in humiliating us in this our extremity 
upon the ground that our frigate exercised an ad 
mitted right in a wrong manner, the wrong growing 
out of a generous motive toward your ship or your 
nation. 

I know it is an important principle that no naval 
officer should take the office of a judge, and I shall 
be glad to see our officers and yours put upon their 
responsibility to conform, in manner and in sub 
stance both, to the Law of Nations, but you 
ought not to push the legal advantage, if you have 
one, too far, where the substantial equity will seem 
to be with us ! If you do, it will be considered like 
striking us while we are down, and will be remem- 



262 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

bered and resented long after this generation has 
passed away. 

One cannot yet fairly judge how far our gov 
ernment and people may be pushed in the way of 
concession. If we do give way much beyond what 
seems to us fair, you may put it down to our in 
veterate earnestness to whip our domestic enemy. 

I hope and believe we shah" get over this near 
danger of collision with you, but I want to see the 
future guarded too. 

If, for instance, you propose to leave the whole 
question to arbitration of parties as nearly disinter 
ested as the case admits of, I think it will be received 
as an earnest of a better state of feeling. The king 
of Italy and the Czar, though opposed to republi 
can institutions, would, I think, be accepted as fair 
referees, of course after proper argument being 
heard from your jurists and ours. 

On the other hand, to insist upon your own inter 
pretation of the international law, or upon referring 
it solely to Louis Napoleon, will, even if we concede 
it, leave a sting that will rankle for half a century ! 
It will confirm all our worst fears that your rulers are 
ready to catch at any pretext, and risk any amount 
of suffering to your own people if they can only 
thus make sure of the failure of republican institu 
tions. The prevailing opinion is that such is the 
disposition of your government, and I daily hear 
men of property and of general worldly prudence 
advocate the necessity of absolute resistance to any 
demand for concession. They reason that it would 



THE SANITARY COMMISSION 263 

break down the spirit of our people and create inter 
nal divisions to a degree that is worse than foreign 
war ! Their policy would be to let the foreign de 
mands intensify our efforts against the rebels, and 
the moment it is ascertained that actual war will 
result, let loose the blacks, cut the dikes which 
confine the Mississippi, and deluge New Orleans and 
the whole of the flat country on its banks ; an easy 
task! 

A spark may thus ignite all the elements of war, 
while public opinion is so nearly balanced that it is 
only to-day that one can speak for ! To-day peace 
is probable to-morrow it may be impossible. 

Happily the balance turned in favor of peace. I 
find my father s recollections next referring to a 
movement, by that time well under way, in which 
he took a great interest : 

" The National Sanitary Commission was one of 
the wonders of the war. Its idea may have been 
suggested in New York State, but it dragged along 
a good while there without coming to anything, 
and they sent to Boston for help. A very few men 
met, either at the city hall council chamber or at 
the green room of the state house, I forget which ; 
there were not over a half a dozen, and it was a 
question what to do. But time pressed, and some 
one suggested that it was still a meeting and could 
appoint a committee. So, without giving particu 
lars, we prepared a circular stating the object of the 
meeting and our appointment of a very large com- 



264 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

mittee (picked out of the whole Massachusetts pub 
lic), with J. Huntington Wolcott 1 as president, to 
carry into effect a resolution (also prepared by us) 
for raising and spending money in concert with the 
New Yorkers. Mr. Wolcott was then a man of busi 
ness, but was not present, and I doubt whether to 
this day he has ever known or dreamed of the small- 
ness of the constituency which appointed him and 
his very respectable associates. However this may be, 
they took hold with a will, did their work just as well 
as if a full meeting at Faneuil Hall had called them 
into being, and laid the foundation for the great 
success of the Sanitary Commission, which was ex 
tended all over the loyal States, with W. G. Eliot at 
St. Louis commanding its Western wing. They raised 
several millions of dollars, spent the money judi 
ciously, and not only by active operations, but by the 
stimulus given to the slower but much more exten 
sive work of the Surgeons and Commissary depart 
ments had great effect in meeting the emergencies 
of the field. Its very irregularity gave the Commis 
sion speed, and it often got ahead of the efficient 
army arrangements, hampered as they were by red 
tape and system. To hear the praises of its advo 
cates, one would think that the chief supplies to the 
wounded through the war came from the Volunteer 
Sanitary. This is simply absurd, but we can hardly 
overrate the real good which the Commission did in 
the field, nor its reflex influence in keeping patriotic 
men and women busy all over the country doing 
1 Father of the present governor of Massachusetts. 



THE SANITARY COMMISSION 265 

their part of the great work. I remember Charles 
H. Dalton and Miss Abby May and Miss I. Gray 
working zealously in this direction. Dr. Henry W. 
Bellows was the nominal head of the Commission, 
and did much. The practical work was in the 
hands of F. L. Olmsted, the landscape gardener, 
and of his deputy, the Rev. Mr. Knapp, of Plym 
outh." 

Some of the questions which had to be dealt 
with by the Sanitary Commission, and its influence 
on legislation, will be gathered from the following 
letters which I find among my father s papers : 

FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED TO J. M. FORBES. 

U. S. SANITARY COMMISSION, 
WASHINGTON, D. C., December 15, 1861. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have just received your favor 
of the 12th, and am exceedingly glad there is so 
good a prospect of financial aid to the commis 
sion from Massachusetts. Your contributions of 
goods have astonished me and overrun all my calcu 
lations. You have done in a month nearly four 
times as much as the New York association of 
which we had been quite proud in six months ! 
If the present rate of supply continues, I shall soon 
be in concern to know where to put it. 

I shall refer that portion of your letter which 
relates to the surgeon-general to Dr. Bellows. The 
simplest statement of the case would be perhaps 
that with an army of 600,000 fresh men, with im 
promptu officers, it is criminal weakness to intrust 



266 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

such important responsibilities as those resting on 
the surgeon-general to a self-satisfied, supercilious, 
bigoted blockhead, merely because he is the oldest 
of the old mess-room doctors of the old frontier- 
guard of the country. He knows nothing and does 
nothing, and is capable of knowing nothing and 
doing nothing but quibble about matters of form 
and precedent, and sign his name to papers which 
require that ceremony to be performed before they 
can be admitted to eternal rest in the pigeonholes 
of the bureau. I write this personally rather than as 
the secretary, and from general report rather than 
personal knowledge, but if it were not true is it not 
certain that as secretary of the Sanitary Commission, 
after six months dealings with these poor, green 
volunteer sawbones, I should have seen some evi 
dence of life in and from their chief ? 

You may contradict the report to which you refer, 
that the contributions made to the Sanitary Com 
mission for the benefit of the soldiers sick have 
been diverted to the aid of the exiles of the rebel 
lion. To this date no funds of the commission 
have been disbursed in St. Louis. Probably the 
local commission there has done something which 
has given rise to the report. 

I have directed Dr. Ware, in visiting Fort Monroe, 
to ascertain the condition of the refugees there, and 
report, but to give them no aid except under advice 
or in an emergency. 

Very respectfully yours, 

FRED. LAW OLMSTED. 



THE SANITARY COMMISSION 267 

DR. H. W. BELLOWS, INCLOSING THE ABOVE, TO J. M. 
FORBES. 

NEW YORK, December 19, 1861. 

MY DEAR MR. FORBES, Mr. Olmsted sends on 
his letter for approval, and it finds me flat on my 
back, which accounts for this delay. Since Dr. Van 
Buren sent on the memorial for signatures, things 
have taken on a much more active state of quarrel 
between the Sanitary Commission and the Medical 
Bureau. General McClellan sent for me and asked 
me to draw a bill for the reorganization of the Med 
ical Bureau, which I did. He carefully considered 
and wholly approved the bill, and personally went 
with me to the President to ask his support ; to the 
Secretary of War (not at home), to the Assistant 
Secretary of War (much the wiser man), who 
heartily approved. By their advice, the bill was 
brought forward in the Senate by Senator Wilson 
a week ago. Several of the leading senators warmly 
approve it. The bill strikes at all the senility and 
incompetency in the bureau and would put about 
eight first-class men, selected by the President out 
of the whole Medical Staff, into the control and 
management of affairs. It would lay on the shelf, 
on full pay, all the venerable do-nothings and senile 
obstructives that now vex the health and embarass 
the safety of our troops. . . . The Medical Staff 
(that is, all but the Medical Bureau and the twenty 
men in right line of succession) must feel the bill to 
be a great boon to them, as it opens eight prizes 
for merit and competency, in their stupid seniority 



268 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

system, where folly at seventy was put in absolute 
control of no-matter-what-amount-of skill, know 
ledge, reputation, and fitness at forty ! I told the 
President, who enjoys a joke, that the bureau sys 
tem at Washington, in which one venerable non- 
compos succeeded another through successive ages, 
reminded me of the man who, on receiving a barrel 
of apples, eat every day only those on the point of 
spoiling, and so at the end of his experiment found 
that he had devoured a whole barrel of rotten apples. 
If there were any radical difficulties about obtaining 
signatures to our letter, they will all disappear when 
our report to the Secretary of War comes out, which 
will be in your hands in about a week. 

We are very much delighted with your financial 
report, which will be louder still when we feel the 
silver bullets or golden balls pouring into our nearly 
exhausted exchequer. 

Commend me to our active and disinterested 
friends, Mr. Ward, Mr. Norton, and the all-alive 
gentlemen of your monetary circle. 
Yours gratefully and truly, 

HENRY W. BELLOWS. 

I give extracts from my father s reply to Mr. 
Olmsted, but the whole of his letter to Dr. Bel 
lows, as the latter shows his characteristic way of 
raising funds for the Sanitary Commission : 



THE SANITARY COMMISSION 269 

J. M. FORBES TO FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED. 

BOSTON, December 21, 1861. 

I only received yours of the 13th yesterday, but 
to make up for the delay, it came indorsed by the 
Dr. with good news of your medical bill, and with 
a good story. I gave parts of it to our committee 
to-day, much to their edification, and it will help me 
in getting the right names to a petition which I 
have drawn up to Congress, and of which I will 
send you a copy on Monday. My idea is to attack, 
from this distance, the system of seniority rather 
than to make personal attacks upon individuals, 
and in this way we can get all the good names in 
Massachusetts. The real trouble is that so many of 
the bureaux of the government have degenerated 
into mere receptacles for files of red tape, that the 
moment you attack one, it becomes personal to all 
fossildom, and arrays it against changes. 

Can I write personally to anybody to help the 
bill ? I know of course our Massachusetts delega 
tion, and can if necessary make some influence 
with Vermont, Maine, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, 
possibly Missouri; but I don t want to waste my 
powder by stirring a hair beyond what is necessary, 
having my hands overfull. . . . 

All our women are eager ; it is only organization 
and direction that is wanted ; and this is one of the 
best offices of the Sanitary Commission. . . . 



270 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

J. M. FORBES TO THE EEV. DR. HENRY W. BELLOWS. 

BOSTON, December 22, 1861. 

I read your message about funds and some other 
parts of your letter to our committee, and we voted 
to send on $10,000 at once. Hope to have some 
more, but it would help us if you would stir up 
New York a little more, and have a movement 
going on there at the same time. We have in 
hand, or promised, $2000 more, especially given to 
your Ladies Society. For the two we are good for 
$15,000 in all probability, and Roxbury $1500 
more for their Ladies Society. A strong effort 
might, if essential at this time, bring still more, and 
we are going on with our systematized levy. Possi 
bly something of our system might help you in 
New York. We got a committee of about twenty 
business men, lawyers, ministers, and doctors, hav 
ing as great a variety as possible, and with power 
to add to their number. I then had a list made of 
all who could afford to pay $25 and upwards (from 
tax-book) adding to it out-of-town names of known 
wealth; then called a meeting of committee, read 
off the list (alphabetically arranged), asking each 
member to accept promptly the duty of calling upon 
such persons as he is willing to also assigning to 
absent members a fair proportion. We then fixed 
upon $200 as the maximum to be asked for, and 
the first week called upon all who were likely 
to give $200 and $100, not refusing $50 when 
offered. We had an address, of which I give you 
a copy, and provided members with slips printed 



THE SANITARY COMMISSION 271 

from the newspapers to hand to our friends, and 
save talking. The large givers exhausted, we came 
down to $25, not refusing $10. Now we send a 
pleasant collector known to ball and theatre goers, 
to pick up smaller sums. Those who have refused 
the large sums may give $10 to the collector. I 
had doubts about asking more than $100 of any 
one, but it has worked well enough. It has been 
considerable work, and I sometimes feel as if the 
money could have been earned almost as easily as 
begged. Our committee have worked with great 
spirit, and now we look for the application of our 
earnings. I hope, whatever you do with other 
money and things, that you will be rigid as iron in 
applying ours strictly to the comfort of our soldiers, 
sick and well. No matter how strong appeals may 
be made for other good objects. One instance of 
deviation will check the enthusiasm of hundreds. 
People feel as if there was some hope of making an 
impression on the extra needs of the army through 
your organization, but if you are tempted to try to 
do anything for other good objects, it will seem like 
risking a certain good for a doubtful success. The 
loyal refugees, for instance, do or may form such 
an enormous object of charity, that if we mean to 
help them at all it must be done by a separate and 
very large organization. 

Your prospect of success with the medical reform 
is most cheering ; if you can effect it, that one act 
will be worth all the rest of your results. 

I speak without any knowledge of persons, but 



272 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

it is clear that it would be the most wonderful 
chance ever heard of, if the oldest army doctors 
proved up to the mark ! We are preparing an 
address to Congress which I think all who are 
asked will sign, simply because it attacks the sys 
tem of seniority, and protests against its application 
to our 650,000 men. I will try to inclose a copy 
of it. A suitable medical board ought to be second 
in importance only to the commanding generals. 
One is great to destroy, the other ought to have 
power to save. The operations of the generals, so 
far as life is concerned, cover only one quarter or 
one fifth of the numbers which the medical board 
with sufficient powers ought to have an influence 
over. The generals cause the death of, say one 
quarter, but even upon this quarter killed and 
wounded, the skill of the surgeons must have a 
marked influence. "When you add to this the power 
of preventing or palliating the diseases which carry 
off the other three quarters, you make a sum which 
ought to dwindle down to the faintest line any 
claims of any persons, even for meritorious services 
to be rewarded! How much smaller the claims of 
those who ask high places as a reward for longevity, 
and for keeping their precious bodies out of harm s 
way so long ! The case needs only to be stated, to 
be decided in your favor ; if you will only keep 
personal quarrels out of it. 

N. B. Of course, you have figured out the im 
portance of the allotment system? 1 500,000 men 

1 The allusion is to a plan for securing from the volunteers " allot- 



THE SANITARY COMMISSION 273 

get per month $6,600,000 wages, of which one 
half, $3,300,000, is a large allowance for necessary 
expenses of men well clothed, and fed, and doc 
tored by government ? Whether the other half shall 
go to frolicking or be used to prevent pauperism of 
the soldiers families, is a great question ! If you 
have any spare time, I hope you will give some help 
to the perfecting and passing of the bill for secur 
ing the payment of the allotments at the expense 
and risk of the United States. 

All hands, sanitary inspectors, chaplains, sur 
geons, and all decent army officers, should use their 
influence with the men to further the allotment. 

The following letter to Mr. Olmsted refers to 
army sanitary reform : 

J. M. FORBES TO FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED. 

BOSTON, December 23, 1861. 

MY DEAR Sm, I have not seen your bill. 
Would not this be a good time to provide in it for 
a statistical report upon the sanitary condition of 
the army frequent enough to be of use for this 
war, as well as for future times? With a proper 
system, and one or two clerks at headquarters, the 
reports of sanitary measures of prevention, of medi 
cal and surgical cases, of deaths, etc., might be 
tabulated on a certain day in each month, and while 
laying the foundation for future statistics, would be 

ments " of their pay for the benefit of their families. A law provid 
ing for this was enacted on December 24, 1861. ED. 



274 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

a great check upon the regimental surgeons, and 
help reform many immediate abuses. It would also 
give the surgeons a chance to make suggestions, 
independently of their colonels. For instance, I 
hear of a surgeon saying, " I wanted the colonel to 
order so and so done as necessary or valuable for 
health," but the colonel does not think it " worth 
while to harass the men," etc. A well-organized 
medical board ought to have influence enough to 
procure general orders for any measures of clear 
sanitary reform, if they only have the disposition, 
and can insist upon certain detailed reports for each 
regiment at fixed times. Truly yours, 

J. M. FORBES. 



CHAPTER XI 

FINANCE IN WAR TIME 

ANOTHER call for exertion and for frequent jour 
neys to Washington now came, owing to the ex 
tremely crude ideas of finance that existed among 
the legislators there. My father writes in his 
notes : 

" During the summer of 1861, an extra session 
of Congress had been sitting, and measures of the 
utmost consequence were discussed and passed, 
including financial ones. . . . Our Secretary of the 
Treasury, S. P. Chase, was a good lawyer, full of 
patriotism and brains, but with no practice as a 
financier, and it took all the influence we could 
bring to bear from New York and the other busi 
ness centres to hold him back in the use of paper 
money, which was his easiest but most dangerous 
resource. We fought hardest on his first plan of 
issuing fifty millions of greenbacks, which were 
made ( legal tenders/ unnecessarily as we thought 
at the time, and as I think now. Our idea was that 
paper money should be held as a last resort, and 
then should be issued as treasury notes and offered 
as a temporary payment to our creditors who chose 
to take them, instead of which Mr. Chase forced 



276 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

their circulation by making them a legal tender for 
all debts. 1 

"Mr. William Gray 2 was the boldest and best 
coadjutor I found in this contest. The first issue 
was only fifty millions, but when I had fought it at 
Washington to the bitter end, and it passed into 
law, I could only express myself by a telegram, say 
ing, We are beaten, and the best speculation now 
would be to buy a paper-mill, which must now take 
the functions of a gold mine. 

" Issue after issue followed, and the best we could 
do was, when the bond question came up, to get 
provision made in the bill for paying interest in 
gold, which alone saved our finances. As it was, 
paper ran down from bad to worse, so that at one 
time the gold dollar was worth $2.80 in paper, and 
three years treasury notes were sold bearing $7.30 
interest per annum, it being fixed at this rate for the 
convenience of computing at exactly two cents per 
day for the three hundred and sixty-five days of the 

1 Compare Mr. Chase s changed views, when in the case of Hep 
burn v. Griswold, 8 Wallace s U. S. Reports, p. 603, in 1870, as chief 
justice of the United States, he declared all the legal tender legis 
lation not only unconstitutional, but also economically and practically 
a mistake. ED. 

2 Mr. Gray s daughter writes of one of these trips to Washing 
ton : " Those days, with all the pressing questions about the financial 
policy of the government, are as clear and vivid in my mind to-day 
as they were then, and I always associate your father and mine in 
the remembrance. I went with them both to Washington once, in 
the time before sleeping-cars were invented, and I remember how 
they talked all night and I listened, sitting up in a common car all 
the way. It took us twenty-four hours to get to Washington then, I 
believe." 



FINANCE IN WAR TIME 277 

year, which was a certain help towards making it a 
popular loan, as the $7.30 formed a very simple sav 
ings bank for any body who could save up a hundred 
dollars." 

Mr. Fessenden was then chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee of the Senate, and to him my 
father wrote in a tone which shows his extreme 
uneasiness at the turn affairs were taking : 

J. M. FORBES TO WILLIAM P. FESSENDEN. 

NEW YORK, January 13, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, I see that the financial question 
is pressing, and before I turn my face eastward I 
cannot help repeating some of the suggestions which 
I have already made, the soundness of which is 
chiefly the discussion here, where so many are 
opposed to them. 

1st. Taxation for interest and current ordinary 
expenses ; on this all agree now, but many will 
oppose if you once get into the "irredeemable 
gulf." 

2d. Your main reliance for carrying on the gov 
ernment must be upon selling your long bonds at 
the best prices they will bring after a fixed policy 
has been announced, and of course using proper 
judgment as to the time and manner of bringing 
them forward. 

3d. Avail of short loans, exchequer bills, or emis 
sion of small notes for currency, under the advice 
of experts in whichever manner or form promises to 
give greatest relief temporarily; but it will be a 



278 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

fatal error to rely upon it as your chief dependence. 
It is limited in amount and liable to great mischief 
the moment it is pushed beyond a certain and very 
moderate amount. 

4th. Make this currency, or short paper, or de 
mand paper, in whatever shape you put it, as good 
as possible by providing for its being received by 
government for all dues, by fixing a mode of its 
redemption, and by making it fundable at a good 
rate of interest. Kaise it all you can, so as to make 
it good, and cause it to be received by all classes 
voluntarily in payment of debts already existing, 
but avoid making it a legal tender unless you want 
to see it depreciate. To make it a legal tender will 
be to give notice to capitalists to get their capital 
out of the country as fast as possible, and to foreign 
capitalists to keep from sending money here, and to 
sacrifice what available stocks they have, govern 
ment included, as early as possible before the depre 
ciation has got very bad. 

5th. Finally, avoid pledging anything but the 
faith of the government for your debt. 

It will be urged to pledge your revenues, or cer 
tain specified parts of them. If this pledge covers 
all your issues, past, present, and future, it amounts 
to nothing. If confined to the present debt and to 
certain specified loans it will be urged upon you by 
those who hold the present loan and wish it secured, 
and who wish to see the war ended, even at the cost 
of disunion or submission, whenever the loan now 
authorized is expended. 



FINANCE IN WAR TIME 279 

If our policy is to be war until we succeed, 
whether it cost us five hundred millions or five 
thousand millions (about England s debt), let us 
have no pledge of our revenue. Even if the loan 
was sure to be limited, it would be unworthy the 
dignity of government to pawn our revenue for it, 
like a Mexican or South American state, and would 
defeat its object if that object really was to raise 
the public credit. 

We are rich and strong, and it only requires 
strong action and wise measures of finance at this 
crisis to carry us through. 

Most respectfully and truly yours, 

J. M. FORBES. 

I fear the interest of the banks in keeping up 
for a little while the price of the long bonds (1881) 
may influence them to other and temporary expe 
dients. If you follow their advice you will soon see 
them slipping out of their long bonds at the best 
prices they can get. 

If one doubted about the true policy, the opposi 
tion to it of the " Herald," the organ of the seced- 
ers, should turn the scales. It goes for irredeemable 
currency and for short expedients. It wants to see 
the war short and disgraceful ! J. M. F. 

J. M. FOKBES TO WILLIAM P. FESSENDEN. 

WILLARD S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, 
February 13, 1862. 

Mr. Gray has gone home not very well and rather 
discouraged. I gave him your message. . . . 



280 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Suppose the stain of bad faith hurts the eight 
hundred and fifty millions of bonds five per cent, by 
discrediting it at home, and keeping out of our reach 
the great reservoirs of European capital (which in 
my opinion is a very small estimate of the pecuni 
ary damage), the nation loses by the operation five 
per cent, on eight hundred and fifty millions, say 
$42,500,000. 

But this low and mean view of the case only dis 
closes a small part of its mischief. We shall have 
the stain and irritation of repudiation of the many 
millions due to foreigners which we promised in 
specie and are to pay in paper, and if we are not 
successful during the few weeks for which time we 
purchase ease by this expedient, we may in conse 
quence of it find such obstacles to our next financial 
move (beyond the one hundred and fifty millions) 
that the legal tender clause may terminate the war, 
a consummation which some of the bankers and 
others advocating it will not weep for ! 

I must say I shall consider it our financial Bull 
Eun. 

With our strong constitution we may get over 
this astounding quackery, but it is a trial I hope we 
may be spared. 

On the other hand with Napoleon holding back 
from interference, with England reacting in our 
favor, with the navy pushing the war into the in 
terior, and with Stanton waking up the army, and 
putting out a declaration of Independence of the 
Satanic Press, it only needs good Anglo-Saxon 



FINANCE IN WAK TIME 281 

pluck in this the very pinch of the game of finance, 
to put us on firm ground. 

The Senate bill, with the legal tender struck out, 
and with a good tax bill, will do this as surely as 
there is a sun in heaven. 

I hope to get off this afternoon, having done my 
best against the monsters. 

I have given almost at full length my father s 
financial arguments, addressed to Mr. Fessenden, 
against " paper money ; " and so I confine the fol 
lowing extracts from letters to the editor of the 
New York "Evening Post," to an argument in 
favor of adhering to a sound currency, not urged 
in his letters to the chairman of the Finance Com 
mittee in the Senate. Of Senator Fessenden in this 
capacity, Mr. Sumner said that he was, in the region 
of finance, what our best generals were in the field. 

J. M. FORBES TO WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT. 

BOSTON, January 22, 1862. 

... I have not seen set forth so distinctly as 
it deserves the point that while speculators, and 
gamblers, and indeed shrewd men in active busi 
ness can take care of themselves, no matter how 
vicious the currency tinkering may be, it is the 
women and minors, the helpless and the poor gen 
erally, upon whom a vicious currency and its conse 
quences are sure to fall hardest. The savings 
banks represent the accumulations of the poor, and 
the effect on them ought to be strongly painted ; 



282 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

but in point of fact the savings in the hands of the 
people are larger than those in the banks, and these 
belong to a still poorer class, who do not accumu 
late enough to make deposits, or who have not the 
habits of thrift of the savings bank depositors. 
Upon this poorer class the loss is going to be still 
sharper. . . . 

THE SAME TO THE SAME. 

BOSTON, January 27, 1862. 

I have your note. I knew you always as the 
champion of sound finance. Your article sets forth 
the effect on the poor ; others have been solely look 
ing to its injury to the rich. ... In great haste, 
yours truly. 

I find my father, during this winter of 1861-62, 
with more irons in the fire than one would have 
thought it possible for any one man to keep there ; 
again stirring up his friend Mr. Sedgwick (who 
was now on a naval investigation committee of Con 
gress) to check the corruption and abuses of the 
navy yards ; applauding Stanton for his Declaration 
of Independence of the Satanic Press; and still 
urging the throwing out of the Legal Tender bill. 
But as to this it is clear he begins to see that the 
inflationists are getting their own way, for he says 
in a letter to Mr. Bryant : 

" I am glad to see the bill still hangs, but suppose 
it will go. The interest in coin, and above all the 
removal of the restriction as to selling bonds at par, 



FINANCE IN WAR TIME 283 

will, if insisted on, do much to modify it, but, after 
all, it will be like a merchant suspending payment 
in a panic, and behaving decently thereafter. His 
assets will be depreciated, and his credit suffer, but 
after a while he may by prudence recover position." 

There is also a letter from him to Mr. Fessenden, 
discussing different ways of raising revenue, of 
which I quote a part : 

" There seems much force in the suggestion made 
in a communication to the ( Evening Post of Jan 
uary 21, that an income tax, being a ( direct tax/ 
can, under the Constitution, only be levied upon the 
citizens of each State in proportion to the basis of 
representation, and consequently will amount to 
very little. Indeed, if this legal objection be sound, 
the tax becomes impracticable. 1 

" But we must reach the rich, and especially that 
large class who hoard more of their income than they 
spend, for they do not pay anything near their share 
of indirect taxes upon importations or excise. We 
cannot reach them through their tobacco or whiskey 
or wines, or broadcloth or silks. A stamp tax is one 
obvious mode of reaching them. Every receipt they 
give for their semi-annual interest, or for the prin 
cipal when paid them, may thus be taxed. Every 
fire or marine policy ; every rent bill they render or 

1 An income tax law was passed, however, at this time and in 
1864 ; and its constitutionality was upheld in the case of Springer v. 
U. S., 102 U. S. Rep. 586, in 1880. But afterwards, in 1895, the 
Supreme Court of the United States reversed its former decisions, 
and laid down the doctrine which is here referred to by Mr. Forbes. 
ED. 



284 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

lease they grant, or contract for sale or lease of 
property ; every settlement in probate ; every invest 
ment they have in railways or canals may be thus 
taxed through the sources of income. 

" Even if there were no doubt as to the income 
tax being a direct tax, and thus objectionable, the 
arguments would be very strong for tapping the 
sources of income rather than the income itself. 
For there are a thousand ways in which income, 
once in the hands of individuals, will evade tax 
ation. We must therefore seize it in the hands of 
corporations if possible, before it reaches the indi 
vidual." 

Another to the same correspondent opposes ve 
hemently the agitation which had sprung up under 
the irritation caused by the Mason and Slidell inci 
dent, for prohibiting the export of specie, a proposal 
which he characterizes as " suicidal and barbarous," 
and " worthy of the political economy of old Spain 
or her colonies." 

These and many other letters of great interest in 
their day I have been prevented from giving at 
length for lack of space, or have omitted altogether, 
and I only give the following, to the New York 
" Evening Post," because it is so short, and shows 
so clearly the deadly earnestness with which my 
father was helping to fight what he now felt to be a 
life or death battle for the Union : 



FINANCE IN WAR TIME 285 

WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE CONVICTED SLAVE 
CAPTAIN ? 1 

Is he, like the rattlesnake in camp, and the crowd 
of detected spies in Washington, to have the oath 
put to him, and to be released ? 2 or to be sentenced 
to imprisonment till sympathizing political friends 
ask his pardon ? The great want of the hour is to 
see one spy the higher his social position the 
better hanged, and thus begin to protect the lives 
of our soldiers from these secret enemies. But if 
this wish of the nation must not be gratified, can 
not we at least hang one of the pirates who have 
sacrificed such hecatombs of Africans ? and thus hint 
to the civilized world that there has been a change 
of administration since slavers were protected, 
England bullied, and Cuba plotted against in the 
interest of slaveholders ! 

The English government may continue to ignore 

1 Captain N. P. Gordon, of the slaver Erie. He was afterwards 
executed at New York, in February, 1862. (4 Reb. Record, Diary, 
37.) Knowing the President s tenderness of heart, and believing it 
very important to make an example of this criminal, my father 
visited Washington with Henry Ward Beecher and Dr. Bellows, to 
urge upon Mr. Lincoln the course which was finally taken. ED. 

2 The reference is to a story of the period which has recently 
been given in the newspapers in the following form : 

" There had been a good deal of bushwhacking along the Virginia 
border, and it was thought that some of this was done by men who 
professed to be loyal. The Union troops naturally felt rather sore 
about it. On one occasion a private soldier called out : * Sergeant, 
I have caught a copperhead, a real snake this time ; what shall I do 
with him ? Oh, said the sergeant, d n it, I suppose the only 
thing you can do is to swear him and let him go. " 



286 JOHN" MURRAY FORBES 

this change, and to visit upon us the sins of our 
Southern rulers, as they have heretofore done ; but 
we might as well begin to enlighten their people, if 
in earnest. JUSTICE. 

The next five letters speak for themselves, and 
with sufficient vigor, on the topics of the hour : 

J. M. FORBES TO W. H. ASPINWALL. 

BOSTON, January 21, 1862. 

MY DEAR MR. ASPINWALL, Some of our infer 
nally weak-backed bank men as soon as they had 
got back here went to overturning all the work they 
had done (under Gray s inspiration) in Washington, 
telegraphing in favor of the hundred millions legal 
tender. Many of the House committee were in 
favor of it before, Chase only half fixed in its favor, 
the horde of contractors, speculators, and debtors, 
headed by your Satanic " Herald," pressed for it. It 
is my conviction that the Senate committee is the 
chief safeguard against its being passed, and they 
cannot stand alone. You must back them up by 
private letters and public opinion ! Here our bank 
ers are troubled by the demand notes, and, not con 
tent with having them made practically good by 
their restriction, want them made a legal tender 
under the delusion that this will make them better ! 
Once abandon the sound principle, and the pressure 
will soon sink the restriction. 

Cannot you rally the " Evening Post " and some 
other sound papers and get them to stand by their 



FINANCE IN WAR TIME 287 

guns? I still wish you and Mr. Minturn and Green 
felt like going to Washington. It looks as if all our 
labor is likely to be thrown away unless some more 
is put in. 

Truly yours in haste, J. M. FORBES. 

J. M. FORBES TO N. M. BECKWITH, PARIS. 

BOSTON, January 24, 1862. 

. . . Barren proclamations to those beyond our 
reach will just now hurt Kentucky and the Northern 
harmony more than it will help the cause ; treating 
slaves well that we do reach is the best preparation, 
and best proclamation to others. I saw in New 
York one of the blacks (yellow), [who was] carried 
off and sold from the Star of the West when cap 
tured. He said the slaves knew in the most distant 
plantations how we used those who came to us, and 
that much stress was laid upon the return by our 
soldiers of a few fugitives ! He says intelligence 
runs fast through the plantations, and he thinks a 
proclamation of freedom, following up well-attested 
good faith to those who had come in, would have 
great effect. In the same " Post " you will find an 
editorial upon the sinews of war : containing much 
good financial doctrine. 

We were just going over the dam into an irre 
deemable currency about a week ago, when a few of 
us made a rally for the doctrines of that editorial ! 
and we saved it for the time, brought Chase over 
half way, where he would by the logic of events have 
been soon forced to come all right, but the horde 



288 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

of debtors, and gamblers, and fools, with the " Her 
ald " at their head, are at it again, and the result is 
still doubtful. With such leaders, what but a sturdy 
Anglo-Saxon people, or a miracle-dealing God, can 
save us from destruction ! If we survive the mili 
tary and diplomatic and financial blunders, it will 
be because we are the strongest people and have 
the strongest government on the face of the earth ! 
I was in New York last week seeing Will off to 
the war, to Beaufort with his regiment, the First 
Massachusetts Cavalry ; a hard trial for his mother 
but we must do our share, and if he goes to the 
Spirit Land, we may not be long behind. . . .

NEW YORK CARS, January 27, 1862. 

MY DEAR CLIFFORD, I am going on to Wash 
ington by " telegraph," and may stay a few days. 
You once gave me a line to Secretary Stanton, but I 
could not find him, after several calls, he being in 
court. I wish you would give me such a letter to 
him as will convince him that I do not come on to 
steal anything from Uncle Sam. In fact my object 
is quite the reverse viz. : to help fight the " legal 
tender " mongrel, a cross between a folly and a 
fraud ! I may also want to talk coast defense with 
him. 

I have a line to him from the governor, but I also 
want one from you, to let him know I am no self- 
seeker, nor office-seeker, nor politician !

FINANCE IN WAR TIME 289 

Thanks to your suggestions, I gave the joint Com 
mittee on Federal Relations a good screed of doctrine, 
and now hope they will act promptly. 

Very truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 

J. M. FORBES TO GEORGE RIPLEY, OF THE NEW YORK 
TRIBUNE. 

BOSTON, February 17, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, I address you not for publica 
tion, but in the hope of influencing the " Tribune " 
for the good which I know you and it aim at. 

I regret your continued onslaughts upon Gideon 
Welles. If they succeed, you will be sure to have 
some wretched political hunker in his place, and to 
drive out Fox, the best executive secretary of the 
navy we ever had ; better where he is than if head 
secretary, with politics too to manage ! 

As to the M. matter I can speak from know 
ledge and experience. I was employed in Boston, 
as he was in New York, minus the commissions. I 
corresponded and conferred with him ; I know the 
difficulties he had to encounter, by experience. I 
say, after full reflection, that his work was, without 
being perfect, the best done of any that the govern 
ment have yet done, always excepting Stanton s 
slaying of the Satanic ! As compared with buying 
through a naval officer, I have no sort of question 
that M. saved five or ten times his commission. 
There is no sort of question, either, that the commis 
sion was too high, and that Gideon blundered ! and 
that M. deserves some scorching for not disgorging 



290 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

the surplus or the whole ; but still, as a whole, the 
thing which might have been better done was well 
done : to blame it too severely is a premium upon 
routine. 

Had Welles spent twenty-five per cent., or about 
a million, more, through the regular channels, he 
would have been all right. Take care, or you will 
drive him out on this issue, and have harpies and 
do-nothings in the place of an honest old man and 
of efficient Fox. 

Fox was too good for the old navy, and was suc 
cessfully transferred to the head of a large manu 
facturing company. He projected the reinforce 
ment of Sumter when it could have been done, in 
the winter, undertook it when desperate, in April, 
and thus precipitated the glorious rising. He 
put younger men at the head of our expeditions, 
which have saved the country, and will save it if 
salvation be possible. He has the old-fogyism of 
the navy to fight, and yet has done much where 
more remains to do. Let him not have to fight the 
fire in the rear, of the head of the liberal party, the 
" Tribune." 

Pray note : I don t say M. s work was perfect, 
nor he blameless of greed, but that you may lead to 
a worse evil by pushing Welles further ! 

Truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 

I pray you not to embalm my name in print.

J. M. FORBES TO WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT. 

BOSTON, February 27, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, I think you are wrong in oppos 
ing the new order of Stanton as to telegrams. I 
have had much experience with the telegraph as a 
business engine, and I know what it must be in 
war. The weakest and most discouraging point in 
our war management up to this time has been the 
looseness with which the telegraph has been left 
open : and Stanton s move to control it seems to me 
one of the best things he has done. I only hope he 
will have a sharp censor or superintendent, and do 
the thing thoroughly. I urged this measure very 
strongly in the spring, and was disgusted at the 
apathy of the higher powers. For with Baltimore 
and Washington and the public offices ever full of 
traitors, the free use of the telegraph seemed to me 
to put Washington in the power of the enemy. 

The telegraph is a mighty engine of war, and, if 
used up to its capacity, is enough to turn the scale. 

Upon our single track railroads we find that the 
erection of a telegraph is worth to us more than a 
double track would be without the wires. It in 
creases the availability of our engines, cars, and men 
enormously, besides the value for safety. I mention 
this as an illustration of what good it may do to the 
army if put under sharp systematic management; 
and beyond all, how dangerous, if the enemy are 
permitted to share its use and our secrets ! 

Very truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 



CHAPTER XII 

JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 

WORK and anxiety had to be lived through by 
all good citizens during that winter (1861-62) 
while the gigantic machine, which afterwards was 
surely and steadily to grind up the " peculiar insti 
tution/ and prepare the way for what became 
really, and not only nominally, the United States, 
was still in course of making and getting into gear. 
None could have worked harder or been more anx 
ious than the subject of this memoir. The navy 
continued to ask his help ; and how much was asked 
of him, and left to his judgment, may be seen from 
such a letter as the following : 

GIDEON WELLES TO J. M. FOKBES. 

NAVY DEPARTMENT, 20 January, 1862. 

SIR, It is understood that one of the iron boats 
built to run to New Orleans is ready for sea at Bos 
ton. You are requested and authorized to charter 
this vessel on the most favorable terms, for three 
months or more, to go in pursuit of the pirate 
Sumter. Before closing the arrangement, however, 
telegraph the department the price of charter. 

The government will furnish a lieutenant com- 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 293 

manding and three acting masters, guns and ammu 
nition, all else to be provided by the owners. 
You can authorize such preparations to the vessel 
as are necessary without sending her to the navy 
yard. 

You may suggest to the department a proper 
person for the command and three others for acting 
masters. The commander can probably obtain a 
good crew from volunteers. Let the owners take 
all but the war risks, and have a favorable proviso 
to enable government to take the vessel at any 
time. 

Answer by telegraph. 

When will the other boat be ready ? 

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant, 

GIDEON WELLES. 

A succession of such calls could not fail to tell : 
my father was now nearly fifty, and it is not to be 
wondered at that his chronic enemy, which would 
have killed a weaker man before he arrived at mid 
dle age, should have taken advantage of its op 
portunity. Accordingly I find him writing in his 
notes : " As the winter dragged on I was attacked 
by a bad cough, and ordered to go South for a 
milder climate." By this time my brother was with 
his regiment, the First Massachusetts Cavalry, sta 
tioned at Beaufort, South Carolina, which had been 
occupied by Federal troops since the Hilton Head 
forts, commanding the mouth of its river, had yielded 
to the guns of the fleet. The relations between 



294 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

father and son were peculiarly intimate, each heartily 
enjoying the other s society ; " as glad to meet 
as if they were lovers/ one who knew them well 
has said. To Beaufort, therefore, the father now 
went, in search of the prescribed " milder climate," 
making the voyage on the paddle-wheel transport 
Atlantic, then commanded by his friend, Captain 
Eldridge. The letter which follows was addressed 
to his wife : 

STEAMER ATLANTIC, &th March, 1862. 
There is nothing like beginning a journal early, 
so I take it up where Alice will have left me, on my 
way to the ship. Cousin Sim 1 would n t hear of my 
plan of ordering a carriage for me and my baggage, 
but would have a wagon for the trunks, and drive 
me down. So I dispatched all my things, bag in 
cluded, to wait for me at the Atlantic, and followed 
soon after. Arrived there, all was bustle and con 
fusion, but our wagon was missing ! gone probably 
to some other Atlantic at some other Canal Street, 
existing in the driver s fertile brain ! Mr. Cary, and 
William, and Sim, and little Johnny, and William 
Kussell all started in different directions, while I kept 
guard in the drizzling northeaster for the wagon. 
Baggage and miscellaneous heaps of things gradu 
ally disappeared into the maw of the monster ship, 
whose wheels were turning and churning up the 
water as if impatient for a start. Frantic women, 
unprotected females, appealed to the captain and to 
Mr. E. L. Pierce to let them go and teach young 

i His cousin, Paul Sieman Forbes, of New York. 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 295 

nigs ; others in despair about their traps, some tear 
ful at parting, the collector busy as a bee swearing 
in the passengers. Finally he bundled up his pa 
pers, the wharf was emptied, and the ship full. The 
captain mounted the paddle-box, and still my pre 
cious trunks came not. I determined to leave them 
and trust to the captain and Mr. Heard for clothes, 
yet lingered on the ladder to the last. Imagine 
my " phelinks " at the idea of not having even a 
tooth-brush! and at the vision of what Mary s cake 
would be when turned out of my trunk a fortnight 
hence ! At last back came Mr. Gary with the wag 
oner in his clutches, who protested that he brought 
all and that it had gone on board, deep, alas, into 
that bottomless pit of a baggage hole, now full to 
the top. Thankful even for this forlorn hope, I 
bade our friends good-by, and took refuge in the 
cabin, where Mr. Heard s things were snugly stored 
in our little state-room ! I leave you to think of 
the anathemas uttered against cousin Sim, against 
the whole race of wagoners, and above all against 
my own feeble-minded self for trusting any of them ! 

Once fairly started I seized the head porter and 
insisted on having my trunks, if the whole had to be 
turned out of their stowage ; then by going down 
myself I luckily managed to get my sea things, and 
so that adventure ended in comedy ! 

Our passengers consist chiefly of the " villain- 
tropic " society, as dear little Sarah s friend, the 
housekeeper in Miss Edgeworth s " False Keys," 
would call it ; bearded and mustached and odd- 



296 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

looking men, with odder-looking women. . . . You 
would have doubted whether it was the adjourn 
ment of a John Brown meeting or the fag end of 
a broken-down phalanstery ! Among others Mr. 
Mack (Stillman s father-in-law, who says he knew 
and liked William H.), Ned Hooper and young 
Phillips of Will s class, and Fred Eustis and son ; 
an officer stationed at Beaufort, Captain Eliot, son 
of the oculist, introduced to me by or through the 
Shaws, Tim Walker s sister, whom I have not yet 
seen; William Bacon and young Brooks, a scatter 
ing naval officer or two, and the usual quantum 
suff. of nondescripts and nonentities, valued doubt 
less by somebody, but offering no salient points to 
fix the eye. 

We made a grand show at dinner, a terrible 
waste of good things for most of them, and then 
plunged into the fog and drizzle of a dirty north 
easter, which doubtless visited you in snow, and 
gave you some twinges at having let me go ! Tea 
and cards in the evening. Mr. Heard seasick, and 
only a few of us haunting the long dining-room. 
A fair night s sleep, variegated with sore throat 
and some coughing, and then a bright morning 
with a westerly gale blowing. Passengers very 
scattering. We had an alarm of a countess, but 
neither captain nor purser know of her, so it is 
doubtless a mistake, unless, like a wolf in sheep s 
clothing she had smuggled herself into Mr. Pierce s 
troop of fifty ! I should not forget to tell you 
of Whist, who was consigned to a porter, nor of 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 297 

Billy, 1 the occupant of a box such as you saw 
horses hoisted in. As he was much exposed to wind 
I luckily found an old sail belonging to the little 
boat Mr. Gary sent on board for me, and went and 
got one end of his box tented in. The top was 
already covered, so he seemed pretty well provided 
for, although the blanket Luther got for him looked 
mighty thin and cottony ! 

This morning after breakfast I was forward by 
the pilot-house, watching the old ship pitch into 
the sea and the gulls following, and the bright sky 
and blue and white waves, when an unlucky billow 
took us at the wrong time, like a boxer hitting his 
adversary when down, and instantly the whole deck 
below, nine feet down, was full of water ; and even 
where I stood it came ankle deep, and even found 
its way, a little of it, down my back as I clutched 
at a rope and turned to avoid it ! The next mo 
ment I looked down upon poor Billy. His box 
had been lifted bodily, turned around, and the iron 
anchor stock driven through it ! Billy had plunged 
forward and got his fore feet outside, and was 
struggling violently among the flukes of the anchor 
to keep his footing, and then, with the intelligence 
of a pony, tried to get back into his box from the 
slippery deck, his box, now shared with the anchor 
stock and generally knocked into a cocked hat ! 
They got him out with whole legs, and he is now 
standing, or trying to stand, on the deck, while the 

1 A little Naushon island horse, taken down as a charger for Lieu 
tenant W. H. F. Whist was a setter. ED. 



298 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

carpenter is mending his box. It was for a time a 
bad sight, and, the water being still surging about 
below, I could not without thorough ducking help 
him, except by advice and consolation offered 
through the singing of the gale ! 

So I have brought you up to the present time. 
Alice can well finish the picture, if she remembers 
our old seat near the captain s end of the table, 
where I am sitting, with my feet on the warm steam 
pipe under the table and my outer man guarded by 
a coat stolen from Mr. Heard to replace my wet 
one, the spray still dashing against the saloon 
square windows, but the sea going down ; and now 
we are sure of good weather for the rest of our trip. 

Four p. M. Thursday, March 6, 1862. I left you 
day before yesterday, well posted up to that time. 
We had just begun to feel comfortable when an 
other gale sprang up, worse than the first and right 
ahead, lasting ah 1 day yesterday and up to this 
morning, when it was again smooth and sunny ; but 
we had lost our chance of reaching Port Royal in 
time for high tide on the bar. At noon we passed 
Fort Sumter and Charleston spires in the distance, 
and were boarded by one of the blockaders for news. 
It is now blowing half a gale again, and we have 
got to He off the bar all night, and until noon to 
morrow, making a four days passage. Yesterday 
I had nothing to tell except of headache, etc., 
which made me too miserable to read or write. To 
day I am about well again, under the more genial 
air, though still coughing. 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 299 

We expect to be boarded in about an hour by 
the pilot-boat, which will take the mail ashore, and 
I make up my package for the chance of its finding 
a vessel ready there to go homeward. I should go 
ashore myself, but that I should there be all adrift, 
and might be exposed to catching cold ; so with my 
usual prudence I hold on. . . . 

To-morrow night I hope to see Will; and now 
with lots of love to the children and to all who love 
me, I am as ever, 

Yours, J. M. F. 

P. S. Tell Mack, Billy looks all right after his 
adventures, though rather sleepy ! Whist, too, is 
bright. Mr. Heard, as I see more of him, seems 
very feeble. I hope the yacht will get down, so 
that I may make him comfortable. This rough 
weather looks rather formidable for her, but she 
may hit upon a smooth time. 

On arriving off Hilton Head my father took to a 
river steamer, and, on her grounding on an oyster 
bank, to the little sailboat brought with him, and 
after some small adventures arrived at Beaufort at 
midnight, " in the sharp stage of an attack of bron 
chitis, not improved by the Southern night air of 
the swampy river, and barking like a very hoarse 
dog." But he adds, " We got passed through the 
lines, and knocked up Lieutenant W. H. F. out of 
his sound warm nap, and soon were rejoicing in a 
cup of hot coffee ; and before long I was resting my 
weary bones on his bed. He had no more idea of 



300 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

seeing me when my voice awoke him than of meet 
ing the angel Gabriel." 

My father enjoyed his first reveille and all the 
camp experience which followed. Beaufort was on 
high ground overlooking the river. Before the war 
it had been the Newport of South Carolina, and 
when the Hilton Head forts were threatened by 
the Federal fleet its inhabitants had gone down 
the river in boats to see it pounded and driven 
off ; and when, instead of this, the Union flag had 
promptly gone up on the fort, they had lost no time 
in getting off from Beaufort, leaving their houses 
just as they stood, a great convenience for the in 
coming tenants. These tenants in the first instance 
were the soldiers, and through the military com 
mandant my father at once found a house which 
quite answered his purpose. But military rule was 
now to be qualified by that of the commissioners 
who had come down on the Atlantic, authorized 
to claim all abandoned property on government 
account; and these, consequently, became in the 
eyes of the army and their hangers-on " the most 
unpopular set of Christians ever seen." They were 
nicknamed " Gideonites " by the military. 

Apropos of this feeling, my father, in the interest 
of fair play, had to write in the following month to 
Mr. Sumner in Washington : 

" The undercurrent against the commission here 
is very strong, even among those who ought to 
know better. First, the cotton agents think their 
interests, and their personal use of negroes, horses, 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 301 

and houses, hurt thereby ; then the sutlers, and 
finally the military, are all prejudiced, especially the 
subordinates ; the lower you go the worse the feel 
ing, the generals and those high up doing, I believe, 
all they can, and showing, so far as I can judge, a 
good spirit. . . . 

" I don t believe in having two sets of treasury 
agents here with equal and sometimes conflicting 
powers, but suppose this has been made so apparent 
that Mr. Chase must have stopped it ere this, and 
put Mr. Pierce distinctly above the cotton agents. 
. . . He is here with enemies all around, and in his 
own association weak brothers and sisters, his 
only friend being the general commanding ; and if 
you hear criticisms you must, and of course would, 
always make allowances. 

" I think, so far as I can judge, the experiment 
must be practically a success ; not equal to the ex 
pectations of sanguine friends, but making a good 
beginning, giving most valuable data for other quar 
ters and doing great positive good to the blacks 
here, and to the confidence of good men in our 
power to make the blacks useful." 

As a matter of fact, the commission did turn out 
a practical success and a "positive good to the 
blacks ; " as any one can learn who will pay a visit to 
their descendants on the Sea Islands at the present 
day. In the same letter to Mr. Sumner, my father 
returns to the negro question as it then stood, and 
adds : 

" There is one thing that I would especially urge 



302 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

upon you and your (our) more extreme Republi 
cans: while struggling for the whole, why neglect 
to secure half a loaf when you can get it ? 

" In the present stage of the negro question, you 
cannot for months to come get the emancipation of 
all rebel slaves. . . . Meantime, cannot you get an 
almost unanimous recognition by Congress of the 
principle that any slave once employed to work for 
the government (by spade, or hoe, or mattock, no 
matter which) shall from that moment be free, 
with his family, providing compensation for loyal 
masters ? 

" If you can do this, clinch it by a registration 
of slaves called into the government service, which 
shall hereafter constitute their free papers. Then 
let all those Sea Islanders now working under gov 
ernment orders be so registered. 

" If you get general emancipation, this will be 
unnecessary ; but if, under either success or disaster, 
some wretched compromise is made, you may here 
after, without it, have a hard struggle to prevent 
these freemen here being given back to their rebel 
masters, with thousands of others who have dug 
our trenches, or otherwise struck a blow for the 
Union ! 

" Do not despise the small things within reach 
while aiming at the large ones you may miss." 

Meanwhile my father and his guests, Messrs. 
Heard, Bacon, and Brooks, had been enjoying 
themselves much in the company of his son William 
and his fellow officers. At first they had to draw 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 303 

supplies through the sutlers, but a few days later 
my father was wakened early in the morning by 
his " plucky and trusty Captain Smith/ who had 
brought the little Azalea down from Naushon, with 
a crew of three, in five days ; after which there 
was plenty in the land, and there were yachting 
excursions to Hilton Head and rides along the 
sands there on the chargers of his friend, Major 
Henry Higginson, who was quartered there. The 
mails, too, always one of his first considerations, 
could now be brought up the river promptly, and 
altogether the Azalea was a great comfort. During 
one of his trips to Hilton Head, he made the ac 
quaintance of the mulatto, Robert Smalls, on board 
the little Planter, which he had run out of Charles 
ton under the guns of Fort Sumter, and was now 
apparently running on his own account. At that 
time he was slight and wide-awake, afterwards to 
become, in carpet-bag times, a very different per 
sonage. 

Early in April came the time when his friends, 
Messrs. Heard and Bacon, had to turn their faces 
homeward. What was done then by a man still 
" coughing like a dog barking " my father confesses 
without contrition in his notes : 

" I took them over to Hilton Head to embark, 
and a fit of homesickness coming over me I just 
stepped on board the Atlantic, with my hand bag 
and coat, and ran back home, leaving the Azalea to 
do transport service for General Hunter, and a line 
to W. H. F. to give notice of my intentions. We 



304 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

reached home in very cold weather, and the doctor 
at once pronounced me insane to come North, and 
ordered me back by the return trip of the Atlantic ; 
and my wife, in spite of her seasickness and the 
cares of the family, determined to go with me. 
Luckily we had a very smooth passage down, and 
she really suffered less than I have seen her do in 
going from New Bedford to Naushon against a 
southwest breeze. We stopped in at Fortress Mon 
roe to get some ordnance stores. Our visit there 
was at the great crisis when McClellan s army was 
collecting for its movement on Eichmond, and al 
ready 100,000 soldiers were around Fortress Monroe. 
It was a gay spectacle. Just before this, the great 
sea-fight between the Merrimac and the Monitor 
had occurred, and the little Monitor lay there with 
steam up, expecting hourly to see the great Merrimac 
come out from Norfolk (fifteen miles distant) to 
renew the attack on our fleet. Our friend, Admiral 
Goldsborough, was then in command of the fleet, 
and the ships which had suffered (without being 
sunk) in the late battle had not yet repaired dam 
ages. I was too ill to go about, but Goldsborough 
came to see me, and my wife visited some of the 
vessels. After a few very exciting hours at Fortress 
Monroe, we put out to sea and reached Hilton Head 
and Beaufort without adventure. I had given up 
my house on leaving, so when we reached Beaufort, 
Dr. De Wolf, the assistant surgeon of the First 
Cavalry, took us into his hospital, giving us his 
room for a night ; and the next day, armed with an 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 305 

order from General Stevens, I managed to get on 
horseback, and with Will s servant went in search 
of other quarters. After examining all the most 
prominent vacant houses within the lines, we pitched 
upon a very nice one outside the camp, at the ex 
treme point where the river branches, or two rivers 
meet. This, though now dismantled, had the ad 
vantage of a veranda, garden, and, best of all, a 
water tank, shaded by some fine live oaks ; and was 
only inhabited by some of the " Gideonites," who 
promised at once to make way for us. A messenger 
was sent out for some negro woman to sweep and 
scrub the floors, and my shawl, laid over a board for 
a sofa, made me a temporary bed ; for the short ride 
had exhausted my strength. After the work had 
gone on some time I received a very unexpected 
visit from the captain of a revenue cutter, who came 
in with a companion, and told me he was sorry I had 
taken so much trouble about cleaning up the house, 
as he had " just determined to take it for his own 
use." He had an air of authority, a good many 
brass buttons, some gilt braid, and seemed to think 
he had settled the whole matter ; he kindly promised 
to pay for the work done, and even criticised the 
brick andirons, which he told his friends would be 
replaced by some better brass ones. I was rather 
angry and very tired, and listened till my patience 
gave out, when I told him that he must leave the 
room, as I was not well ; and when he brought me 
an order from General Stevens countermanding the 
one I had, he should have the house, and not till 



306 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

then. Our friend, Tom Motley, 1 had come in while 
the fine gentleman was making his remarks, and I 
just asked him to take my horse, which stood saddled 
in the yard, and go to headquarters. My naval 
friend had hardly gone, when Tom returned with a 
message from General Stevens to the effect that the 
house was mine, and that if anybody interfered with 
me he would send a corporal s guard to protect me ; 
and here ended this little skirmish. 

" By dinner-time my wife came round, and with 
a trunk for a table we made our first meal and got 
to housekeeping ; some of the officers sent us pieces 
of furniture which they had " borrowed " from 
former owners, and we were soon reasonably com 
fortable." 

With the little Azalea close by, they felt quite at 
home, and, with the exception of one scare of a 
raid, spent a quiet and happy time watching the 
negroes, young and old, busy over their spelling- 
books, " getting education ; " making excursions in 
a rickety wagon, one day picnicking with their son 
while he was on picket duty, and another listening 
to the twenty-miles-off bombardment of Fort Pulaski, 
and finally, just before leaving for home on the 14th 
of May, enjoying the delicious blackberries which 
the colored folk had begun to bring in heaping 
baskets on their heads. Looking back upon this 
time in 1886, my father writes : 

"My two visits to Beaufort seem like a dream 
with only a few distinct points ; the yellow jasmine, 

1 Brother of John Lothrop Motley. ED. 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 307 

and the other flowers of the woods and gardens, be 
ing the most pleasant. Among the comic incidents 
my exhibition of the Spencer rifle may be worth tell 
ing. I had brought with me in the Azalea one of 
the first specimens of the Spencer six-shooter ; had 
tried it at Naushon, and was confident it would turn 
out the great success which it afterward proved. 
Telling Admiral Dupont about it on his ship (per 
haps the frigate W abash) at Hilton Head, he asked 
me to show it and sent a boat to the Azalea for me. 
It was about noon, when the 500 men of the ship 
were being mustered on deck, and all eyes were 
upon me as I snapped the gun, aiming through an 
open port. It was the first time the gun had ever 
missed, but either my nervousness or the devil inter 
vened and it stuck fast ; I could not get it off and 
had to drop it in disgust. 

" As a whole our recollections of this trip are very 
pleasant ; we found the climate delightful most of 
the spring ; my cough gradually yielded, and about 
the middle of May we again embarked on the At 
lantic and made our way home." 

But before leaving, my father had become quite 
intimate with General Hunter, who commanded at 
Hilton Head. He had found him on his first trip "a 
wonderful specimen of an enlightened army officer 
who had been converted by secession into an aboli 
tionist." They had long and confidential talks to 
gether, and he appears to have sympathized with the 
general s enlisting colored soldiers "long before 
Governor Andrew was allowed to do so in Massa- 



308 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

chusetts," and with his issue of a proclamation of 
freedom, in May, 1862, which, however, brought 
down on him a rebuke from the President. He was 
evidently privy to the following pungent answer of 
General Hunter to inquiries made by Secretary 
Stanton, in consequence of resolutions introduced 
into the House of Representatives hostile to the 
emancipation or enlistment of the slaves : 

" Question 1st. Whether I had organized or was 
organizing a regiment of fugitive slaves in this 
department ? 

" To the first question I reply, that no regiment 
of ( fugitive slaves has been, or is being, organized 
in this department. There is, however, a fine regi 
ment of persons whose late masters are fugitive 
rebels, men who everywhere fly before the appear 
ance of the national flag, leaving their servants 
behind them to shift as best they can for them 
selves. So far indeed are the loyal persons compos 
ing this regiment from seeking to avoid the presence 
of their late owners, that they are now one and all 
working with remarkable industry to place them 
selves in a position to go in full and effective pur 
suit of their fugacious and traitorous proprietors." 

On his return to Boston came a letter from Mr. 
Sedgwick : 

C. B. SEDGWICK TO J. M. FORBES. 

WASHINGTON, 18 May, 1862. 

... I hope God will give his servant Abraham 
the grace to stand by his general and not let the 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 309 

border state men sacrifice him. I cannot say, how 
ever, that I have the highest degree of faith in a 
president who thinks it necessary to salvation to 
allow the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law 
in this District at this time. . . . 

My father had been much exercised during both 
trips to Beaufort by the prejudice against the Edu 
cational Commission, and the unfair treatment of 
them; and immediately on his return home he 
wrote the following letter to the treasurer of the 
commission : 

J. M. FORBES TO EDWARD ATKINSON. 

BOSTON, May 23, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, ... I would gladly do anything, 
except come before the public, to help your good 
work. You may use my testimony in any other way 
than over my signature, and the indorsements of the 
" Daily " l and other journals would seem to answer 
all purposes. I have watched the Educational Com 
mission from its very inception with the greatest in 
terest, and, while in Secessia, had every opportunity 
to gauge it, not only by the criticisms of its many 
enemies, and by the statements of its friends, but by 
personal observation. It was started very late, and 
when only the most prompt and even hasty measures 
gave it a chance of success. These measures were 
taken chiefly at Boston, with that efficiency which 
marks our good city and State. A large number of

310 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

volunteers were hurried from various pursuits, down 
into South Carolina, where, in about ten days after 
the enterprise was first thought of, they found them 
selves landed, with bare floors to sleep upon, soldier s 
rations to eat, and the obloquy and ridicule of all 
around them for " sauce piquante." 

Under all their inexperience, and all these disad 
vantages, they have worked their way quietly on, 
and up to the time when I left, May lith, when the 
new rule of military governor was about beginning, 
they had accomplished the following results. 

First and foremost. They had inspired confi 
dence in the blacks by their kindness, and especially 
by their bringing the first boon which these forlorn 
creatures had received from us, namely, an oppor 
tunity for education. In all else the negroes have 
been materially worse off than under their old mas 
ters, with only their scanty ration of Indian corn, 
no shoes, blankets, clothing, molasses, or other neces 
saries, and no luxuries given them, of which they 
formerly had a moderate allowance. Against all 
this they had had only the doubtful advantage of 
idleness or precarious employment, and the promises 
of the cotton agents. It was a great point to put 
over them intelligent and Christian teachers, and 
this they have fully appreciated. 

Second. The material benefits which have re 
sulted, namely : beginning very late, the forces of 
the plantation have been organized to reasonably 
steady labor ; a full crop of food has been planted 
in common, besides many much larger private, or, as 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 311 

these are called, "Negro Grounds/ planted than 
ever before. I saw repeatedly whole gangs who 
had finished their plantation work by ten A. M., and 
had all the rest of the day for their own patches, 
some of which are four or five times as large as 
usual. 

Third. In addition to the food crop, enough 
cotton land has been planted to give the negroes, if 
they are allowed to take care of the crop and enjoy 
its fruits, more of the necessaries and indeed com 
forts of life than they have ever had before. 

To sum up, we have then for some of the results, 

The confidence of the blacks ; 

The education, so far as it goes ; 

The encouragement of industry ; and 

The material advantage of food and cotton 

crops ; 

instead of leaving the negroes alone to run into vice 
and pauperism, or turning them over to the tender 
mercies of hard speculators. 

Of course, the agents of the commission have 
made mistakes in some cases, and some of them 
have been ill chosen, and have helped the enemies 
of the enterprise to bring it into local discredit; 
but generally the whole has been a most successful 
undertaking, and most of those sent from this quar 
ter have, by their patience, faithfulness, and dis 
interested zeal, been a credit to Massachusetts. 
They, as a whole, form a noble band of men and 
women. They have had everything to contend 
with, especially the opposition of many with whose 



312 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

interests they interfered, and of others whose pre 
judices they offended. Their predecessors on the 
plantations, the cotton agents and military, had 
begun to look upon themselves as the successors to 
the planters, entitled to the use of all that was left, 
houses, horses, negroes, crops. 

When the agents of the commission came down 
to take charge of the plantations, they were looked 
upon as interlopers, and in most cases every obstacle, 
short of absolute disobedience to the orders of the 
commanding general, was thrown in their way. All 
the little mistakes of the new-comers were magnified ; 
all the good they did ignored, and a local public 
opinion thus created against them, which many of 
our own soldiers, who ought to have known better, 
gave in to. " What a ridiculous thing for these 
philanthropists to come down and teach the stupid 
negroes, and occupy the plantations, and use the 
secesh ponies which had been so convenient for our 
pickets!" 

Such was the natural feeling of the unthinking, 
and of some who ought to have reflected. This false 
opinion was largely availed of by the " Herald " 
and other kindred papers, to create prejudice at the 
North against an enterprise aiming to improve the 
condition of the blacks. How much more satisfac 
tory to this class would it have been to have had the 
negroes left to their own devices, and then given all 
the enemies of improvement a chance to say, " We 
told you so ! The negroes are worse off than be 
fore, idle, vicious, paupers. The sooner you reduce 



JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH 313 

them to slavery again, and the more firmly you bind 
the rest of their race to eternal slavery, the better!" 

It would take too long to go into the question of 
what is to be done hereafter ; but there was an emer 
gency three months ago which has, in my opinion, 
been successfully met; and among other results I 
believe you will have the testimony of all who have 
been engaged in the experiment, that it has dis 
tinctly proved that the negro has the same selfish 
element in him which induces other men to labor. 
Give him only a fair prospect of benefit from his 
labor, and he will work like other human beings. 
Doubtless hereafter this selfish element must be 
appealed to more than it could be by the agents of 
the commission. There must be less working in 
common, and more done for the especial benefit of 
each laborer. It is much to establish the fact that 
this element of industry exists. 

In conclusion, I consider the Educational Com 
mission up to this time a decided success. I con 
gratulate you and your associates upon having added 
another to the good deeds of Massachusetts, not by 
any means forgetting the share which New York 
has had in the good work ; and I sincerely hope that 
General Saxton, cooperating with you, may in a 
manner worthy of his high reputation complete 
what has been so well begun. 

Very truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 



CHAPTER XIII 

THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 

DURING my father s stay at Beaufort, S. C., he had 
been impressed with the inadequacy of the Union 
forces stationed on the Sea Islands for any forward 
movement; and so, soon after his return home, I 
find him (with the view of averting if possible the 
consequent trouble) trying to stir up the press on 
the subject. The following letters show with what 
eagerness he was using every means of influence 
within his power, in this and other matters of pub 
lic welfare : 

TO PAKKE GODWIN, EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK " EVEN 
ING POST." 

BOSTON, June 23, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, ... The " New Bedford Mer 
cury," under its new management, is getting to be 
quite a live paper. I wish as much could be said 
for our administration, which seems to be carrying a 
millstone about its neck in its dread of the border 
States and of "Hunkerism" generally. I believe 
to-day that the old Union Democrats, and even the 
true men of the border States, are ahead of Lincoln 
upon this question of hitting the rebels hard with 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 315 

the negro or any other club. It is strange when a 
rattlesnake is attacking us that we should be so deli 
cate about the stick we hit him with ! 

I look with much anxiety to our operations in 
South Carolina. Beauregard s army, on its way from 
Corinth, passes directly by Charleston. Our force 
is ridiculously small for attack, the Key West troops 
included if they can get there. Our negro 
brigade amounts to nothing until trained. "We need 
prompt reinforcement there, or we shall have 
another blow half struck, or possibly a recoil there. 

TO CHARLES B. SEDGWICK, WASHINGTON. 

June 2, 1862. 

MY DEAR MR. SEDGWICK, I see I forgot the 
21stly, as the old parsons used to say, of my ser 
mon ; my amen to your emancipation speech. 

If you have such a devilish poor set in Congress 
that they are afraid to pass your bill, for freeing 
such slaves as come to our aid, you had better give 
up trying for any emancipation bill until Parson 
Brownlow, General Rodgers, and other pro-slavery 
border state men have cultivated the manliness of 
Congress up to the Tennessee standard ! Why, I 
hear that the border state Unionists everywhere are 
in advance of Congress, and go for strangling the 
rebellion through its vitals, not pinching the ends of 
its toes ! Rather than take anything worse than 
your bill, I would trust to old Abe s being pushed 
up to the use of the military powers of emanci 
pation. What infernal nonsense is your present 



316 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

law, making freedom the reward of those who serve 
the enemy, while their masters only promise them 
hanging and burning if they serve us. 

You carry on the war in such a manner that either 
slaves or other loyal men in the border and rebel 
States have one plain road to safety open ; namely, 
to help the rebels. You reward the slaves with 
freedom for such help : you offer them no reward, 
except the chance of being shot by us and hanged 
by their masters, if they come into our lines ! . . . 

Your lame confiscation bill will be no terror to the 
rebels, but rather an indication of the mildness with 
which you will treat them hereafter, and the many 
exceptions you will make if you pass any confisca 
tion acts. 

I only wonder with such a policy that any Union 
men show their heads ! All your efforts seem to be 
to make rebellion cheap and easy, and loyalty hard 
and dangerous. 

In great haste, I bide yours, 

J. M. FORBES. 



TO THE SAME. 

BOSTON, June 7, 1862. 

MYDEAB MR. SEDGWICK, Cannot you get some 
ingenuous Hunker ... to offer a little simple amend 
ment to the emancipation bill that shall provide for 
the freedom of any slave (and his family) who may 
serve the United States, a certificate from the military 
officer cognizant of such service to be his warrant 
for free papers from any court of record, etc., etc., 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 317 

loyal masters to be compensated rascals not ? 
Such an amendment, coming from a radical, disor 
ganizing red Republican like C. B. S. of Syracuse, 
would be of course summarily put down ; there 
must always be a ferocious cat, or royal Bengal 
tiger rather, under his meal ! but such an innocent 
and proper provision would be, I suppose, unan 
imously adopted if offered by some moderate Repub 
lican. Our good friend Horton now would carry it 
nem. con., unless you radicals, from the mere force 
of habit, oppose him. . . . 

General Hunter hit the nail on the head when he 
said to me, " I want to find out whether we, as well 
as the rebels, are fighting chiefly for the preserva 
tion of slavery ! " 

Trebly conservative as I am, I sometimes get so 
disgusted with the timidity and folly of our moderate 
Republicans that I should go in and join the Aboli 
tionists if these last were not so arbitrary and illiberal 
that no man of independence can live in the house 
with them. Yours, 

J. M. F. 

TO CHARLES SUMNER, WASHINGTON. 

BOSTON, June 21, 1862. 

MY DEAR MR. SUMNER, The inclosed is from 
a Russian who was once, I believe, in the Czar s ser 
vice. Thinking it possible that you might have a 
chance to show it to the President, I have had a fair 
copy made of the substance of it, and inclosed. 
Please return me the original. I used to think 



318 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

emancipation only another name for murder, fire, and 
rape, but mature reflection and considerable personal 
observation have since convinced me that eman 
cipation may, at any time, be declared without dis 
order ; and especially now when we have two white 
armies in the field to prevent mischief. The Russian, 
you see, is of this opinion from his experience. We 
now have, too, for the first and perhaps only time, 
the power to emancipate, under the emergency of 
war, without infringing upon the Constitution. 

The only question, then, is as to the necessity. Of 
course we are not to wait until the last deadly neces 
sity comes. We have spent millions upon millions 
of money and thousands of lives. Shall we wait 
until the deadly fevers of the South have stript off 
more thousands, and until our credit begins to totter 
under the load? I am no philanthropist, but I do 
want to see the promptest and hardest blows struck. 
I only ask that the weakest point of the enemy shall 
be assailed before throwing away more valuable 
lives. 

TO THE SAME. 

BOSTON, June 27, 1862. 

MY DEAR MB. SUMKER, The inclosed 1 will 
explain itself. If you don t object, you may think 
it worth sending to the " Evening Post," with our 

1 A squib in the form of a supposed letter from a business firm to 
Senator Sumner, referring to the acknowledged acceptance of a 
bribe by a United States senator, and frankly proposing to bribe 
Mr. Sumner into obtaining government contracts for them. ED. 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 319 

names struck out ! I do not see how the Senate 
can sit with a member who acknowledges such 
operations, unless a majority of the senators are 
rotten. Even then I should think the honest ones 
could stuff it down their throats. If you don t do 
something, the public verdict will be that you dare 
not denounce what has been a senatorial custom. . . . 
Whoever it hits. Republican, Hunker, or pro-slavery 
Democrat, the knife ought to be applied, and all 
the sooner because the immediate sinner is a soi~ 
disant Republican. 

TO C. B. SEDGWICK, WASHINGTON. 

BOSTON, June 27, 1862. 

MY DEAR MR. SEDGWICK, I have not heard a 
word from you since I wrote you an abusive letter 
because you did not go far enough in your bill. I 
will take it all back if you are offended, and make 
the most abject apologies ! What is the present 
market price of a senator ? S. was rather dear at 
fifty, but I suppose he was rather high up on the 
committee ! 

When are you coming this way, and when will 
you and Mrs. Sedgwick give us a visit at Naushon ? 
We shall go there some time next month. 

I was sorry, but not surprised, to see that we had 
had a rebuff at Charleston. 1 When I returned from 
Port Royal, I wrote to Senator Wilson urging re 
inforcements and predicting disaster if we went 

1 Probably referring to a skirmish at Secessionville, S. C., in 
which the Union forces were defeated. 



320 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

without them. I don t think now our forces are 
safe on the Sea Islands, outside the guns of the 
navy, without reinforcements. 

Very truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 
How beautifully easy you legislators have made 
money ! How valuable your restriction to one hun 
dred millions ! 

C. B. SEDGWICK TO J. M. FOKBES. 

WASHINGTON, 29^ June, 1862. 

MY DEAR MR. FORBES, Well, by Jove, if this 
is n t the luckiest escape I ever had ! I have been 
swearing at myself the last fortnight for abusing you 
like a pickpocket, taking no notice of your friendly 
letters which by way of penance I have kept on my 
table where I should see them on coming in or 
going out, on lying down and rising up, expecting 
every day to hear that you had denied on Change 
having ever seen me, and now comes your letter 
offering an apology. Good ! make it ! it shall be 
accepted, although your last letter was abusive. 
The truth is I vowed never to write you until I had 
settled for you the inclosed account, 1 which you 
sent me just twenty-seven days ago. They tried to 
send it back, but I said no, I wanted it paid, and I 
have only just got it, although it appears to have 
been made out several days. Please sign it in all 
the places where you see room for your name and 
return it to me, and I will hand over the money to 
the Sanitary, if you still remain charitably inclined. 

... I showed H. your letter about generals 

1 Of expenses incurred on the Ship Commission. 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 321 

giving certificates to loyal blacks who had served 
the government, which would serve as manumission 
deeds to them and their families. It seemed to go 
through his feathers as a good practical idea, and 
he has taken the letter home to Ohio to consider of 
it and sit on it ! 

I have yet some hopes ; I think the tone of Con 
gress is improving, but very slowly. If Mallory 
don t succeed in hanging me, as he proposes, I may 
bring them up to something practical yet. 

Grimes is crowding the principle of your sugges 
tion in the Senate and says he shall pass it. There 
is a scriptural objection, however, to success ; it is 
written that " you may bray an ass in a mortar, she 
will not be wise." How would firing them out of 
Porter s mortar answer? After we have been 
whipped a few times, as we were on James Island, I 
think our ideas on the subject of natural allies will 
be improved. Do you see that your friend Fremont 
has been kicking out of the traces again ? I fear 
J. has been putting him up to this folly. You will 
have to give him up as one of the impracticables, 
and go in for some more steady and less mercurial 
general. 

About Naushon ; I should like to swing a ham 
mock under a beech in the forests there about 15th 
August and sleep for two weeks. I am tired out ; 
we have pretty much reorganized the whole Navy 
Department. I have worked hard upon it and am 
fatigued. After making it all over new, would it 
not be well enough to give it a new head ? . . . 



322 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

After being home three or four weeks I want to 
come down to your kingdom by the sea to rest. I 
will bring my wife down to talk. Please let me 
know what time in the last half of August it will be 
convenient for you to see us. 

I am very sorry for that reverse in Charleston. I 
shall try and make a row about it, but I suppose it 
will do no good until Eichmond is taken. If you 
find money hard to be got let us know and we will 
get out another batch of greenbacks. The next 
bill will make provision for a large government 
paper-mill, and so we will save all the profits. 
With kind regards to Mrs. F. and the children. 

The following letter to my mother from the doc 
tor of my brother s regiment may serve to indicate 
how she seconded the efforts of my father, and to 
show that part of their time at Beaufort must have 
been spent in finding out the needs of the hospital 
there. Later on in the war, the Armory Square 
Hospital in Washington, three wards of which were 
presided over by our friends Miss Emma Ware, Miss 
Lowell, and Miss Stone, could have given a similar 
account of care and thought. 

DR. DE WOLF TO MBS. J. M. FORBES. 

HILTON HEAD, SOUTH CAROLINA, 
July 9, 1862. 

MY DEAR MRS. FORBES, Your box reached us 
safely this morning. A steamer leaves for New 
York in two hours, and I make haste to tell you 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 323 

how much I wish that every regiment in the service 
had a Mrs. Forbes to look after its hospital depart 
ment. 

When the doctors began to look around after the 
engagement at James Island, they found themselves 
destitute of a great many things they needed to 
make their wounded comfortable. The cavalry regi 
ment had more material suited to the occasion than 
any other five regiments in the expedition. Our 
chests and boxes were opened wide, and our reputa 
tion as always looking out for No. 1 was never less 
selfishly exhibited. The credit does not belong to 
us, but more than to any one else, to you. I have 
written Lieutenant Forbes to-day telling him of the 
boxes we have received, and begging him to thank 
you for us. Without seeing it personally one can 
not imagine how much the want of such material 
embarrasses an army on the march or the field. At 
best, men must suffer a great deal ; but without con 
stant attention to the clothing, bedding, and dress 
ing of the sick and wounded, their condition is 
terrible. At present we have need of nothing. 
The fifty sheets you have sent us have made our 
measure full ; those we wanted ; the rest will be 
packed away against our time of need. . . . 

Of the summer of 1862 my father writes in his 
notes as follows : 

" In that summer I had the satisfaction of getting 
up the Committee of a Hundred for promoting the 
use of the blacks as soldiers, and acted as chairman 



324 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

of it. We raised, I think, about $100,000 by sub 
scription among the most conservative Republicans. 
The first two Massachusetts regiments of colored 
troops were in course of formation (54th and 55th), 
in which I was able to do something towards the 
choice of the right officers, as well as in raising the 
men, Colonel Shaw having the 54th and N. P. Hal- 
lowell the 55th." 

The actual appeal for funds for raising the col 
ored regiments was not made till February, 1863. 

Another enterprise in which he took a great in 
terest is disclosed in the following letters to a pro 
minent lawyer in New York : 

TO WM. CURTIS NOTES, NEW YORK. 

BOSTON, July 28, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, Hardly a day passes that I do 
not see some article which ought to be republished 
in each of the loyal States : Evarts s letter, your 
New York resolutions, one day, something from the 
" Evening Post " or " Tribune," another, something 
better from the rebels, proclaiming themselves " aris 
tocrats and masters bound to rule us." 

It seems to me that we need a publishing com 
mittee with headquarters in New York, and a 
member at each principal point. When anything 
good comes out, it can always be copied without 
cost, and a quantity of slips struck off at insignifi 
cant expense. These should be sent with the in 
dorsement of a member of the committee to each 
important newspaper. The chief cost would be in 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 325 

postage, and this might fairly be obviated to a large 
extent by calling upon members of Congress for 
franks for an object of such public interest. If 
you approve of the idea, perhaps you will talk 
with Mr. Bryant and other leading men, and act. 
I shall be away all summer, but I suggest for 
Boston James B. Thayer, a lawyer, brother of W. 
S. Thayer, formerly connected with the "Evening 
Post," now consul-general to Egypt. Party and 
personal interests ought to be carefully kept out of 
it, and the vigorous prosecution of the war made its 
chief object. Such an article as I inclose would 
just now be of great value in raising recruits, and 
opening the eyes of the people to the real nature of 
the contest, aristocracy vs. popular government, and 
slave labor vs. free labor. It is pretty clear that 
your leaders are " marching on " in New York, and 
it is now mainly important to enlighten the working 
classes. 

If they could see where the real support of the 
war lies, it is my belief that they would force 
the administration and the generals to fire into the 
enemy s powder magazine, and then we should soon 
come down to Mr. Seward s sixty days duration of 
the war ! Please return me the inclosed cutting, 
which I mean to make worth several recruits, and 
oblige, 

Yours truly, J. M. FORBES. 



326 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

TO THE SAME. 

NAUSHON ISLAND, August 12, 1862. 

MY DEAB SIR, Your favor of the 7th has been 
sent me here, where I am established for a month or 
two, with a chance to visit Boston only occasionally. 
I am very glad that my plan strikes you favorably. 
Governor Andrew made me a flying visit yesterday, 
and seems to like the idea much ; he had already 
made use of the slips I sent him of the " aristocracy 
vs. popular government " by sending them to the 
recruiting stations. 

I sincerely hope a thorough system may be in 
augurated under your personal oversight in such 
a manner as will shut off any attempt to use it 
either for personal ambition (i. e. for lauding politi 
cal or military aspirants), or even for pushing the 
views of our most extreme Republicans. To do its 
best work, it needs to be broader than any one set 
of men, even the best, belonging to our wing of the 
Republican party. In other words, its aim should 
not be anti-slavery, except incidentally, but should 
be " the vigorous prosecution of the war." How 
would it do to style it " the committee of correspond 
ence upon the vigorous prosecution of the war " ? 

Mr. George W. Curtis, who is here, and has 
considerable experience with the press, thinks there 
is some danger of jealousy from the press at the ap 
pearance of dictation there would be in my original 
plan of sending with each article a circular from 
the committee, suggesting its republication. If this 
be so, perhaps the best mode would be to have our 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 327 

organization complete, but informal ; that is to say, 
not appearing before the public as a committee. 
The articles we wish to have republished would, in 
most cases, if well selected, be adopted in each 
State, either at the individual suggestion of our 
committeeman for that point, or they might be sent 
anonymously with a printed or written line, saying, 
for instance, that a (( fellow-countryman calls your 
attention to the inclosed important article as valuable 
for circulation." 

One of the most important ends that could be 
gained by a judicious organization would be to sink 
and obliterate the old party names and prejudices, 
especially those connected with the name of demo 
crat. 

You and I have fought under the Whig ban 
ner; one of our strongest allies is Mr. Bryant, the 
leader of the only really Democratic party which 
ever existed. Yet we constantly find our best Re 
publican journals even now fighting " Democracy." 
It seems to me of vast importance to sink these old 
distinctions, and to put before the voting and fight 
ing masses, in the strongest light, the real issue 
of the war-Democratic or Republican [government], 
(whichever we may call the government of the peo 
ple) vs. Aristocratic government ; in other words, 
the people vs. a class. . . . 

I give you a rough sketch of an organization, and 
am very truly yours, 

J. M. FORBES. 



328 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

The idea thus expressed took form in a small 
organization called " The New England Loyal Pub 
lication Society." Before the society was formed, 
my father was working out the plan in his own 
office, using his clerk for the business of sending 
out hundreds of printed slips all over the country, 
and through Governor Andrew to the army. By 
degrees, however, the work became too much for a 
man as busy as he was at this time, and, as I have 
said, the society was formed. Supported by him, 
and other patriotic men, 1 it developed by degrees 
into an organized and efficient agency for the dis 
tribution of- sound doctrine on finance and politics. 
The editor collected the best articles and speeches 
that met his eyes, and these were printed on a broad 
side, and sent to nine hundred different newspapers 
all over the country. Many local editors were glad 
to find part of their work ready to their hands, and 
availed themselves eagerly of these sheets. After 
careful inquiry, the society felt assured that their 
publications reached something like one million 
readers. 

The whole thing gradually grew into a regular 
publication, issued once a week, keeping as its name 
the title of the society ; it was under the charge of 
Mr. C. E. Norton, now Professor Norton of Harvard 
University. The yearly cost of the whole came to 

1 The executive committee was as follows : J. M. Forbes, Presi 
dent; Wm. Endicott, Jr., Treasurer; J. B. Thayer, Secretary; C. E. 
Norton, Edward Atkinson, Martin Brimmer, Rev. E. E. Hale, Henry 
B. Rogers, Professor W. B. Rogers, S. G. Ward. 



THE PROSECUTION" OF THE WAR 329 

something under $4000. My father used to say 
that he accomplished more in this way than in any 
other during the war, a statement which indi 
cates, at any rate, his interest in the work and his 
confidence as to its success. The practical manage 
ment of the work was in the hands of Mr. Norton 
and the secretary, Mr. J. B. Thayer, now Professor 
Thayer of the Harvard Law School. 

In the fall of 1862 the following memorandum 
was sent to Governor Andrew. It was " probably 
used," says my father, " with members of Congress, 
and not sent to the War Department : " 

" Minor Reforms Needed. September, 1862. 

" 1st. Drunken officers. The public, rightly or 
wrongly, attribute part of the mischief at Bull Run 
to one, Colonel M., commanding the reserve. . . . 
If there be no time for courts-martial, why not 
quietly shelve every drunkard ? 

" 2d. Skulkers. The President found at Har 
rison s Bar half his army unaccounted for. The 
papers tell of crowds of stragglers helping to make 
panics in each battle. The enemy shoot their 
stragglers. We might at least drop, if not from a 
tree by a rope, at least from the army list, every 
skulking officer. . . . The inclosed cutting gives a 
hint of where the record can be found (the Mar 
shall House and City Hotel, Alexandria) of the 
doings of 135 officers on Sunday, August 31, when 
our army was in its greatest peril. Why not call 
on each to account satisfactorily for his being there 



330 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 1 

on that day ? In short, why not have an efficient 
police system to correct this crying evil ? 

" 3d. Spies. The spies have thus far slain more 
than any other arm of the enemy. We hear of one, 
a famous guerilla, being condemned to die in Mis 
souri ; but it looks like a mere excuse for punish 
ing other crimes. Several have been imprisoned, 
some compelled to take the oath ! ! but not one 
choked to death, they probably being practised in 
swallowing hard oaths ! We see accounts from Nor 
folk of three rebel mail carriers caught passing our 
lines with private letters only, nothing of public 
interest, and these will doubtless be leniently dealt 
with ! Who can say what dangerous cipher those 
private letters carried ? or whether the real object of 
their mission a short military dispatch was not 
swallowed or destroyed? . . . Shall we encourage 
spies and informers by continued leniency toward 
mail carriers from our lines to the enemy s ? Wash 
ington thought it necessary to hang the noble 
Andre. Can it be doubted that the enemy destroy 
without any compunction any of our spies or mail 
carriers ? We hang a man for the doubtful mili 
tary crime of hauling down a flag, and we let pass 
free, or punish lightly, men who, by all military 
usages, and by the dictates of common sense, de 
serve the heaviest punishment. Half a dozen spies 
hanged would have saved as many thousand lives, 
and have given confidence to our own people and 
soldiers in the earnestness of their leaders, civil and 
military. It is not too late to begin. 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 331 

" 4th. Robbers, in the shape of contractors, and 
of army officers receiving commissions [on purchases 
or sales for the government] ; in short, the army 
worms of our military wheat. Of course, eternal 
vigilance is the only remedy for this disease. How 
would it do, as a sort of scarecrow at least, to insert 
a clause in each contract, that the contractor be 
comes by signing it subject to martial law, both as 
to his person and property? Without legislation 
it would not be binding, but many, nay, most of the 
new contracts will run beyond the meeting of the 
next Congress, when we may have a law for it, and 
by signing such a contract, agreeing to be amenable, 
the party could not complain that the law was ex 
post facto. 

" We who are paying taxes feel that the army 
contractors and the commission-receiving officers 
are eating us up. The soldier feels it in his bare 
feet and back, and sometimes in his empty stomach, 
and a hint from the Department would surely give 
us such a law during the first week of the session. 

o 

The enemy does not tolerate drunken generals, 
stragglers, spies, or thieving contractors. Let us 
remember the old proverb, Fas est et ab hoste 
doceri. " 

GOVERNOR ANDREW TO J. M. FORBES. 

BOSTON, September 13, 1862. 

MY DEAR Sin, I like your suggestions very 
much, but I venture to suggest : 1st, that having 
perused the report of the testimony . . . printed 



332 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

... by order of the Senate, I do not think any 
part of the disaster of Bull Run was due to Colonel 
M., and I think that on the weight of the evidence 
he was sick, but not intoxicated. . . . 

2d, as to contractors. I think the department 
can do nothing in the direction you propose ; Con 
gress might. And I think General Meigs might 
properly be appealed to for an opinion. Stanton 
can know but little about the matter directly. And 
I think a part of the rage against him is due to the 
contractors who like a long war and were angry 
that Stanton tried to shorten it. 

3d, as to skulkers and spies. Unless the General- 
in-Chief is in earnest, these reforms are impossible. 
The department may fulminate regulations, but in 
vain, as long as imbecility, disobedience, evasion of 
duty, neglect of duty, coldness towards the cause 
itself, distinguish the General-in-Chief. 

The department is powerless for reform while 
the army is led as it now is led and has been led 
hitherto. It can only give rules and orders, but it 
remains for the officers in command to enforce 
them. The President persists in retaining those 
who will not do what you and I think zeal and 
faithful service demand. The reform is only pos 
sible by a new commander in the field. Thus be 
lieving, I have not the heart to write of these details 
to the Secretary. 

I am ever faithfully and most respectfully yours, 

JOHN A. ANDREW. 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 333 

One of the great difficulties in the war is dealt 
with in the following passage from my father s 
notes, in regard to his work in recruiting : 

" After the first enthusiasm of the war had died 
out, it became much more difficult to get new re 
cruits, and drafts were resorted to ; which induced 
various towns called upon to resort to large boun 
ties. This money element naturally drew out the 
worst men from the cities ; many of the rough cus 
tomers enlisting with the intention of deserting and 
getting new bounties. At one time when recruiting 
for the Second Cavalry, we had in a single day a 
squad of about a dozen recruits brought in from 
New York by the Fall River steamer, who appeared 
at our recruiting office and seemed about to sign, 
when a whistle from their leader took them all off 
and we saw no more of them. This experience was 
more or less repeated as long as the war lasted. . . . 

" During this period Mr. Amos A. Lawrence and 
I were acting together, and I persuaded him to join 
me in what proved to be a very successful experi 
ment. The large bounties brought into the field a 
great number of middle-men, whose business was to 
collect recruits, and who often took the largest part 
of the bounties themselves. Mr. Lawrence and I, 
with the governor s assent, decided to become our 
own brokers, and got an order that any engagement 
of ours should be accepted by the draft officers as 
equivalent to men. We then engaged with the 
large towns, agreeing to furnish them with men at 
the best prices they were willing to pay; so en- 



334 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

abling them to settle their share of the draft with 
out supplying any more men. When we had got 
a considerable fund, we engaged the men directly 
ourselves, or through our enlisting officers, among 
whom George Quincy was prominent, paying them 
a smaller price than we received from the towns, 
but giving it them direct; and thus they got a 
great deal more benefit out of it than when they 
treated with the brokers. In this way we filled up 
our regiments and had a fund, which was used to 
continue recruiting, for the regimental band, and 
for various other useful purposes, until the end of 
the war. My impression is that we enlisted in this 
way over two thousand men, and had a fund of 
seven or eight thousand dollars left." 

I find from my father s files of letters of this 
time that he must have done a very inordinate 
amount of writing in regard to the recruiting of 
troops. Some of his correspondents got at logger 
heads with one another, insisting on laying com 
plaints of each other before him, as to trespassing 
on the other s district. This was one of many 
tedious and petty vexations that troubled him in 
the midst of his intense work. 

His notes continue : 

" Antietam, with its drawn game claimed as a 
victory, came September the 19th, 1862, and, after 
that, a period of reorganization in regard to our 
army which only some historian can record. At 
this time the public, through the press and in many 
other ways, took a hand in the game, and had great 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 335 

influence on the action not only of Congress, but 
still more upon that of the administration of Presi 
dent Lincoln, who was always disposed to follow 
public opinion rather than to be a bold leader in 
the strife. 

" After trying Burnside, who failed at Fredericks- 
burg signally, and Hooker, who while a brave and 
energetic corps commander lost his head completely 
at Chancellorsville, chaos followed till Grant was 
put at the head of our whole army, notwith 
standing some faults which alarmed us at the time 
when he was thus selected ; but he had the strength 
to overcome them, and by his genius, his firmness, 
and above all his magnanimity towards other officers 
around him, he fully justified Lincoln in his selec 
tion, and left a record which will place him among 
the great men of the world." 

The letters that follow indicate the anxieties, the 
plans, and the efforts to shape the course of events 
in the great drama that was going on, of my father 
and of some of his correspondents who were among 
the most influential men of the time. A great step 
had been taken in September, when the President 
issued his preliminary proclamation as to emancipa 
tion. 

W. C. BRYANT TO J. M. FORBES. 

OFFICE OF THE EVENING POST, 
NEW YORK, October 16, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, What your friend says of Grant 
may be the truth, so far as he is acquainted with 
his history. But I have friends who profess to be 



336 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

acquainted with him, and who declare that he is 
now a temperate man, and that it is a cruel wrong 
to speak of him as otherwise. I have in my drawer 
a batch of written testimonials to that effect. He 
reformed when he got or was put out of the army, 
and went into it again with a solemn promise of 
abstinence. One of my acquaintances has made it 
his special business to inquire concerning his habits, 
of the officers who have recently served with him or 
under him. None of them have seen him drunk, or 
seen him drink. Their general testimony is that he 
is a man remarkably insensible to danger, active, 
and adventurous. 

Whether he drinks or not, he is certainly a fight 
ing general, and a successful fighter, which is a 
great thing in these days. 

W. P. FESSENDEN TO J. M. FORBES. 

PORTLAND, November 13, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your letter, and 
also the newspaper puff, for which I am probably 
indebted to you. McClellan s removal is a great 
step, but it should have been taken a year ago. 
There was no excuse for giving him the command 
of the army after his Yorktown campaign, and the 
President cannot defend himself for so doing. He 
knew his unfitness and admitted it. If it had not 
been proved before, the failure to win Antietam 
(for he did not win it), and to attack Lee on the 
day following, demonstrated either his incapacity or 
his treachery. Fear of offending the Democracy 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 337 

has been at the bottom of all our disasters. I am 
not clear that the result of the elections is not for 
tunate for the country, for it has taught the Presi 
dent that he has nothing to look for in that quarter, 
a fact which any sensible man might have seen. 
The only way to get the support of the Democracy 
is to show that you don t fear them. It is a mis 
take to suppose that you will gain anything of such 
people by conciliation, or by admitting them to 
your councils. 

As to the cabinet, I have no belief that there will 
be any change. Seward will never yield his place 
willingly, and the President never will ask him to do 
so. But, whatever may happen, no man could be of 
much use in a cabinet office, for no man could carry 
out his own views. You cannot change the Presi 
dent s character or conduct, unfortunately; he 
remained long enough at Springfield, surrounded by 
toadies and office-seekers, to persuade himself that 
he was specially chosen by the Almighty for this 
great crisis, and well chosen. This conceit has never 
yet been beaten out of him, and until it is, no 
human wisdom can be of much avail. I see nothing 
for it but to let the ship of state drift along, hoping 
that the current of public opinion may bring it 
safely into port. For myself, I can only say that 
there is no political calamity I should look upon 
with so much dread as the being asked to share 
the responsibility of guiding it. I have neither the 
strength nor the wisdom requisite, and if I had, it 
would be useless. No, my friend, I can, perhaps, 



338 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

render my country some service where I am. In the 
cabinet I could no nothing, and no friend of mine 
should ever wish to see me there. 



TO W. P. FESSEKDEN. 

BOSTON, November 15, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your note received. I must 
differ from you about the President. He has been 
in the hands of a vacillating, undecided man like 
Seward ! 

With your decided opinions, if you were once in 
the cabinet, he and aU the political aspirants there 
would form into line and march to your music. 
Even Chase would be glad to see some one else put 
at the head to take the responsibility. His opinions 
are firm enough, but he lacks your uncompromising 
directness of will. The only possible doubt is your 
health, and you may as well die at the head of the 
nation a few months hence, after saving it, as at 
the head of the Senate a few years hence, fighting 
the compromisers and rebels combined. 

A prominent New York man ascribes, in a private 
letter, the late failure there 1 to Seward and his 
friends, and says the President ought to know and 
act upon it. He adds, " The accession of Mr.W. P. F. 
would delight me." He [my correspondent] is a man 
who, perhaps, next to you, ought to be there himself, 
though known at the bar rather than in public life.

and the election of Seymour, the Democratic candidate for governor.

THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 339 

TO JOSHUA BATES, OF BARING BEOS. & CO., LONDON. 

Boston, November 11, 1862. 

MY DEAR MR. BATES, Nothing from you lately ; 
and I suppose even your steady nerves and heart are 
shaken by our long supineness. We have awaked 
at last, and if we had only a William Pitt to put 
over our cabinet, we should be all right. 

Mr. Chase, I hear, shows some signs of returning 
sanity by inquiring (outside of the clique who had 
his ear) as to his future course. Our friend Hooper 
has a good deal to answer for in leading him into 
the legal tender labyrinth ; it will take wiser heads 
to guide him out. We are not quite lost yet, and 
if the report due next month shows that he has 
sounded the depths of the currency issue as a 
resource, and is coming back to sound principles of 
finance, we may, with large revenues from our tax 
bill (reported to be very large), and with some mil 
itary vigor, still save ourselves from utter ruin, 
financially, I mean. 

Somehow or other, in spite of weak-kneed friends 
and open traitors at home, and a sharp enemy out 
side, we can and will keep the old ship together. 

To fail now is to establish the most dangerous mil 
itary government for our neighbors that the world 
ever saw. Five or six millions of whites despising 
labor, and having a black slave race to work for 
them, while they fight ! If we disarm, with such a 
neighbor unconquered, and our so-called democracy 
ready to ally itself with them, we may as well give 
up our government at once and return to feudalism. 



340 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

I hope you will give me the benefit of a hint now 
and then from your deep stores of financial expe 
rience, and am, with best regards to Mrs. Bates, 
Yours, very truly, J. M. FORBES. 

My father s notes of this period go on to say : 
" Besides the military situation during 1862, came 
the alarm in regard to the extension of the system 
of outfitting cruisers against us in European ports, 
which had got to sea and were driving our ships 
out of the carrying trade ; and especially the build 
ing of two powerful ironclad warships by Laird, at 
Liverpool, which not only threatened our cities and 
ports on the coast, but seemed to render foreign 
intervention probable. My relations with the Navy 
Department and with Mr. Fox, the assistant secre 
tary, who carried on the executive work there, 
were very close, and led to a good deal of consulta 
tion by letter and otherwise ; which communications 
were kept very carefully to ourselves." 

I give here three of these communications, show 
ing how alive to the danger the Navy Department 
had become, and how unprepared the northern sea 
ports were to withstand any attack from ironclads : 

G. V. FOX TO J. M. FORBES. 

NAVY DEPARTMENT, November 22, 1862. 

DEAR SIR, ... As to our defenses, I believe 
this is about the truth. The Alabama can be kept 
out by our present forts. She is doing a better 
business, with less risk, than attacking Boston. No 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 341 

forts can keep out ironclads. We must have obstruc 
tions easily raised. There are no big guns to spare. 
Parties cannot make guns who are not experienced. 
We have started half a dozen new foundries in New 
England the last year, and got only one good gun. 
Any man for a year past, and now, who wishes a 
contract for big guns can have it. No one has ever 
been refused. As to ironclads it is the same. 
Every one is invited and has been, and no one 
capable of doing the work has been refused. So 
with marine engines. We will build a vessel for 
every party who will take an engine. Washington 
is reported to have said, " In peace, prepare for 
war." We didn t, and here we are. It is of no 
use to sacrifice anybody ; we are caught uprepared, 
and must pay for it. ... We are building some 
wooden-bottom turret ships in the navy yards to 
carry four 15-inch guns. We fired the 15-inch 
gun at nine inches of iron. It did not penetrate, 
but it shook the whole affair nearly to pieces. We 
are in the hands of the contractors, who are doing 
all they can, but it is far short of public expectation. 
In the mean time, if harbor obstructions are not 
provided, our cities are not safe against ironclads. 

THE SAME TO THE SAME. 

NAVY DEPARTMENT, December 9, 1862. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have your letter of the 3d 
inst. The matter of purchase of vessels fitting out 
in England has frequently been under discussion, 
and, as a matter of precaution, is expensive, as it 



342 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

would involve us in unlimited purchases without 
entirely curing the evil, since every steamer could 
not be obtained. There are but very few of the 
English steamers that escape our cruisers. I think 
it safe to say that not one in twenty has landed a 
cargo and returned safely to England. 

The Kate, an iron steamer, has been the most 
successful, and she could not cross the ocean. She 
has just been lost at Wilmington by running into 
the obstructions at New Inlet. With regard to two 
ironclads (one at Glasgow and one at Liverpool), 
I think it very important to purchase them if they 
can be obtained for money. Mr. Welles favors the 
idea, and Mr. Seward simply urges it. If Mr. 
Upton could do this, I think it would be well to 
send him out. If you will talk the matter over 
with him, and it seems feasible, Mr. Upton had bet 
ter come on. No one but Mr. Seward, Mr. Welles, 
and ourselves need know it. Their vessels fitting 
to run the blockade can be disposed of, but the iron 
clads (if rumors in regard to them be true) are a 
more serious matter, deserving of instant action at 
any price, since we have not a port North that can 
resist an ironclad of very moderate power. 

THE SAME TO THE SAME. 

NAVY DEPARTMENT, December 19, 1862. 

DEAR SIR, I have yours of 17th inst. I fancy 
there can be no ironclads for the rebels put into 
the water before May. But they require strict 
watching and ample measures to guard against their 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 343 

coming over here. Mr. Seward is of the opinion 
that the English government are very anxious for 
us to come into their market for the purchase of 
vessels, that we may be put upon an equal footing 
with the South. The reclamations in the matter of 
the Alabama have disturbed them very much. With 
this view of the matter, Mr. Welles rather inclines 
to some doubt about making any purchases. I 
think you and Mr. Upton better come on after the 
holidays ; it would be good to discuss that and other 
matters. 

When a superintending Providence deprives us 
of all means of recruiting our armies, I believe we 
will call upon those who, at least, will, by their 
desertion, paralyze the rebels. The President re 
marked to me the other night that he was very 
anxious to have us take Sumter, and that he would 
man it with negroes. When the Nahant leaves, we 
shall have the number of ironclads fixed upon as 
the least number to go into Charleston. That vessel 
will not probably leave before the first of January. 

There is a good deal of depression felt at the 
repulse at Fredericksburg, and the President is 
exceedingly disturbed; but it seems to me that, 
looking over the whole ground, the movements 
contemplated West, and the probability of getting 
possession of the remaining ports South, we should 
hardly deserve success if we allowed our faith to 
waver now. It is a matter of regret, however, that 
the whole military force of the country is not used 
to expel the enemy from Virginia. 

I/ 



344 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Of this period my father says in his notes : ~ 
" It was the darkest time of the war, though its 
grand turning point (outside of what the army and 
navy could do) was approaching in the Proclamation 
of Emancipation," the final proclamation pro 
mised in the preliminary one of September, 1862. 

The following letter from Mr. Sedgwick gives a 
lively account of the state of feeling in Washington 
at the time of writing. It led to my father s draw 
ing up an address to the President from the presi 
dential electors of 1860, and forwarding it to Mr. 
Sedgwick, who obtained the required signatures, 
and then sent it on to Mr. Lincoln. It is inserted 
in its place below. 

WASHINGTON, 22d December, 1862. 

MY DEAR MR. FORBES, I have shown your 
letter (copy) to Mr. Fessenden to several conserva 
tive gentlemen of my acquaintance. They all agree 
in saying that it would be well to send on a strong 
delegation of clergy and laity to urge on the Presi 
dent. Some doubt his intention to issue the procla 
mation of 1st January; I do not. Many assert, 
more fear, that it will be essentially modified from 
what is promised. I do not fear this ; but what I 
do fear is, that he will stop with the proclamation 
and take no active and vigorous measures to insure 
its efficacy. I say he will issue it, because it is his 
own offspring, which Seward tried hard to strangle 
at its birth, and failed to do it. If the President 
don t tell you all about it some time, I will, as I 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 345 

heard the story from the chief himself. Judge 
Kelly told me this evening he had just come from 
Stanton, who told him that the President and Burn- 
side had been there but a little while before, and 
this subject coming up, the President said " that he 
could not stop the Proclamation if he would, and he 
would not if he could ; that just as soon as the first 
of January dawned it would be issued." So I can 
not doubt that it will be issued. There are other 
facts within my knowledge which convince me that 
it will certainly go forth. Every conceivable influ 
ence has been brought to bear upon him to induce 
him to withhold or modify, threats, entreaties, all 
sorts of humbugs, but he is firm as a mule. 

Now if Banks can start from Mobile or New 
Orleans with a sufficient army, or send Butler, 
which will be equally well, perhaps, armed with this 
proclamation, and enlist every able-bodied, willing, 
loyal negro, as he progresses into the country, until 
he has 100,000 of them under arms, the great 
work will be accomplished. If Banks was sent 
South for some such purpose, the expedition is a 
sensible one ; if not, it is pure strategy, and not 
worth, in the aggregate, so much as one of the 
rotten ships in which it was embarked. I say by 
all means come on and be here in force the last of 
this month. Be ready to shout Hallelujah on the 
morning of 1st January, and let the President know 
that he is to have sympathy and support. By all 
means, put him up to practical measures to make it 
successful. Tell him the world will pardon his 



346 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

crimes, and his stories even, if he only makes the 
proclamation a success, and that if he fails he will 
be gibbeted in history as a great, long-legged, awk 
ward, country pettifogger, without brains or back 
bone. 

We have had a nice row in the cabinet. The 
Senate had a secret caucus and resolved to get rid of 
the President s evil genius, Seward. Preston King, 
fearing Seward, loose, would endanger his prospects 
for senator, slipped out and told Seward all about 
it. Seward tendered his resignation Wednesday 
evening. By Thursday morning his friends began 
to pour in, to threaten the President if he accepted 
it. The world in general only found it out on Fri 
day. Chase, like a good boy, on Saturday went out 
to bring little wandering Willie back. The tele 
graph is forbidden to carry the startling news to 
the country, except, now, to my Lord Thurlow * and 
some others ; and on Monday all goes " merry as a 
marriage bell" again. So the Senate is snubbed, 
Seward is more powerful than ever, Chase s radical 
friends are disgusted that he has been used to save 
Seward from his folly, and the great chasm into 
which the administration was to fall is bridged. 
Vive la Humbug ! 

The electors letter above referred to was as fol

THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 347 

December 24, 1862. 

To ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United 

States, Washington : 

Sir, The undersigned, as electors, performed 
two years ago the pleasant duty of certifying to 
your appointment to the chief magistracy of this 
country, by the choice of the people. 

Believing that the approaching new year brings 
with it a crisis in the life of our nation, they beg 
leave to congratulate you upon your having begun 
the greatest act in American history, the emancipa 
tion of 3,000,000 of blacks and of 5,000,000 of 
whites from the power of an aristocratic class. 

It is admitted upon all sides that the transfer of 
three millions of slaves from the productive force 
of the rebels to our scale in the balance would in 
stantly end the rebellion ; it follows that each slave 
so transferred will proportionately contribute to that 
end. 

It is only a question of time when emancipation 
must take place, and it is believed that no time 
can ever occur so safe from unnecessary violence as 
when the slaves have the strength of the Union to 
rally behind, and when a large army of rebels can 
and ought to be thus withdrawn from opposing the 
laws, to the more fitting work of keeping order 
around their own homes. 

For these and other reasons the undersigned be 
lieve that emancipation is the weapon which, effi 
ciently used, can not only strike at the heart of the 
Rebellion, but lay the foundation for a true and 
permanent republic ; a consummation even more 



348 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

beneficent to the moral and material interests of the 
people of the South than to those of the Northern 
people. 

They therefore earnestly pray you to complete 
now your great work by taking every possible mea 
sure to carry into practical effect the promise of your 
Proclamation of 22d September, and especially by 
demanding imperatively of every person in the mili 
tary, naval, and civil service of your government to 
obey strictly the regulations by which you will en 
force your new settled policy. 

They believe that by so doing you will place your 
self among the great benefactors of your country 
and of the human race, and that you will live in 
future ages by the side of the Father of his Country 
George Washington. 

Respectfully submitted, [ELECTORS.] 

With the view of placing the Proclamation of 
Emancipation in the hands of the negroes them 
selves, my father had 1,000,000 copies printed on 
small slips, one and a half inches square, put into 
packages of fifty each, and distributed among the 
Northern soldiers at the front, who scattered them 
about among the blacks, while on the march. Sum- 
ner approved the idea, as will be seen by the follow 
ing letter : 

WASHINGTON, Xmas Day, 1862. 

MY DEAR FORBES, Your letter of 23d was on 
my table when I returned from an interview with 
the President, where much had been said about the 
Proclamation. He is now considering how to pro- 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 349 

claim on 1st January. It will be done. He says 
of himself that he is hard to be moved from any 
position which he has taken. He let me know last 
evening of his plan to employ African troops to hold 
the Mississippi River, and also other posts in the 
warm climates, so that our white soldiers may be 
employed elsewhere. He seemed much in earnest. 

I did not write at once on the receipt of your let 
ter of 18th December, because it found me exces 
sively occupied, and because I had been already 
assured by the President with regard to the Procla 
mation. I see no objection to printing the extract 
from Stephens l on the sheet with the Proclamation ; 
and I like much the idea of distributing the Pro 
clamation through the army. I have exhorted the 
President to put into the next Proclamation some 
sentiment of justice and humanity. He promised 
at once to consider it. 

Why not send to all the hospitals, camps, posts ? 
The more the better. 

Ever yours, CHARLES SUMNER. 

It would seem that this letter must have crossed 
that from my father, which follows : 

TO THE HON. CHARLES SUMNER. 

BOSTON, December 27, 1862. 

MY DEAR MR. SUMNER, I had hoped to have 
sent you to-day communications to the President 

1 " This stone (slavery), which was rejected by the first builders, is 
become the chief stone of the corner in our new edifice." (Speech of 
Alex. H. Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederate States, delivered 
March 31, 1861.) 



350 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

from the rest of our electors (except Mr. Morey, 
absent in Europe) all indorsing the Proclamation and 
begging for its enforcement; but the electors are so 
widely separated, from Nantucket to the Connecticut, 
that concert of action is difficult. Whittier will 
probably write a letter instead of signing with us. 

May I ask of you the favor to present the letters 
already sent you, carefuUy including Judge Chap 
man s cordial assent. 

I sincerely hope that you and others will have 
sufficient influence with the President to insure his 
giving us on 1st January such a Proclamation as 
will only need the " General Orders " of his subordi 
nates to carry into effect not only emancipation but 
all the fruits thereof, in the perfect right to use the 
negro in every respect as a man, and consequently 
as a soldier, sailor, or laborer, wherever he can most 
effectually strike a blow against the enemy. 

It seems to me very important that the ground of 
"military necessity" should be even more squarely 
taken than it was on 22d September. Many of our 
strongest Republicans, some even of our Lincoln 
electors, have constitutional scruples in regard to 
emancipation upon any other ground, and with them 
must be joined a large class of Democrats, and self- 
styled "Conservatives," whose support is highly 
desirable, and ought to be secured where it can be 
done without any sacrifice of principle. 

I know that you and many others would like to 
have it done upon higher ground, but the main 
thing is to have it done strongly, and to have it 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 351 

so backed up by public opinion that it will strike 
the telling blow, at the rebellion and at slavery 
together, which we so much need. 

I buy and eat my bread made from the flour 
raised by the hard-working farmer; it is certainly 
satisfactory that in so doing I am helping the 
farmer clothe his children, but my motive is self- 
preservation, not philanthropy or justice. Let the 
President free the slaves upon the same principle, 
and so state it that the masses of our people can 
easily understand it. 

He will thus remove constitutional scruples from 
some, and will draw to himself the support of a very 
large class who do not want to expend their brothers 
and sons and money for the benefit of the negro, 
but who will be very glad to see Northern life and 
treasure saved by any practical measure, even if it 
does incidentally an act of justice and benevolence. 

Now I would not by any means disclaim the 
higher motives, but where so much prejudice exists, 
I would eat my bread to sustain my life ; I would 
take the one short, sure method of preserving the 
national life, and say little about any other mo 
tive. . . . 

Forgive me for writing so much, and for asking 
you to try to urge my poor ideas upon the President, 
but I feel strongly that we all need encouragement 
and hope ; and a good strong Proclamation full of 
vigor, of freedom, and of democracy, would almost 
compensate us for the dreadful repulse of Fredericks- 
burg. Truly yours, J. M. FORBES. 



352 JOHN MURRAY FORBES 

Mr. Sumner writes the next day : 

WASHINGTON, 2&A December, 1862. 

MY DEAR FORBES, Last evening I handed to 
the President a memorial from clergymen, calling on 
him to stand by his Proclamation, reading it to him 
aloud. 

I then handed him your slip Audax, which he 
commenced reading. 

Then a slip from a Boston paper, advertising a 
musical celebration in honor of the Proclamation, 
1st January, with all the names, yours among the 
rest. 

Then the unsigned address 1 from the electors, 
which he proceeded to read aloud. 

I then read to him Mr. Chapman s letter, which I 
enforced by saying that he was now a very able 
judge of our Supreme Court, 2 once a Hunker, and 
not much of my way of thinking in times past. 

I then proceeded to dwell on the importance and 
grandeur of the act, and how impatient we all are 
that it should be done in the way to enlist the most 
sympathy and to stifle opposition. On his account 
I urged that it should be a military decree, counter 
signed by the Secretary of War, and that it should 
have something in it showing that though an act of 
military necessity and just self-defense, it was also 
an act of justice and humanity, which must have the 
blessings of a benevolent God. 

1 This was an address slightly different in form from that sent 
through Mr. Sedgwick. ED. 
a Afterwards the chief justice. ED. 



THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR 353 

The President says that he could not stop the 
Proclamation if he would, and he would not if he 
could. Burnside was present at this remark. 

I find Stanton unusually sanguine and confident. 
He says that he shall have 200,000 negroes under 
arms before June, holding the Mississippi River and 
garrisoning the ports, so that our white soldiers can 
go elsewhere. The President accepts this idea. 

Let the music sound, and the day be celebrated.
