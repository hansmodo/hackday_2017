TO MY COMRADES 

OF THE 

34TH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

i 

I dedicate to you this imperfect narrative of our "three year s service." You will 
require no apology for the minuteness with which our life in its early and most 
uneventful period has been detailed. Rather, you will share my regret that it has 
been impossible to give an equally minute account of tbe stirring incidents of our 
later days service. I have made no attempt -to give a connected narrative of our 
military life : on the contrary, at the risk of being tedious, I have endeavored to 
weave together extracts from familiar letters and diaries in such manner as to 
review, more fully than could otherwise be done, the fast fading recollections of 
our soldier life. The labor will be amply repaid if only partial success attend it. 

The work has been done at your request, and for your gratification. Had it 
been intended for the general public, much might have been omitted and many 
things been varied in the telling. Such as it is, it is committed to you, in the 
hope that you will pardon its faults overlook its defects and accept whatever 
of good there may be in it as a slight, but heartfelt tribute to your worth as 
soldiers by one who is proud to have been your Commander in the past, and to 
subscribe himself, now, your warm and grateful friend, 

THE AUTHOR 



TO MY READERS. 

Years ago I was honored by my associates of the Regimental Association with 
a request to prepare for publication a history of the 34th Massachusetts Infantry. 
Various causes combined to delay the execution of what thus became a duty. 
What seemed easy to be done was found to be, in reality, difficult to do. All the 
official and many private papers connected with the organization and early service 
of the Regiment were destroyed, or lost, in the hurried evacuation of Martinsburg 
and Harper s Ferry, consequent upon the advance of the Rebel Army under Early, 
in the summer of 1804. The members of the Regiment were confidently relied 
upon to furnish material facts and incidents connected with our service, more 
.especially during the period when my own enforced absence deprived me of oppor 
tunity of personal observation. The residence of many of the men, however, was 
unknown ; many, probably, to whom circulars were addressed, were not reached 
at all; and of those who were reached, most made no response. Necessity, 
therefore, compelled me to draw more largely from my own "Diary," and letters 
written to personal friends, than under other circumstances would be excusable. I 
am, however, under very great obligations to Major Willard, Capts. Elwell and 
Soley, and more especially to Lieut. Judd, for aid, without which the work would 
not have been completed, even in its present form ; and for which did I not 
make this public acknowledgment, I should be ungrateful, indeed. I have 
appended to the public life of the Regiment, at the risk of seeming egotism, a 
narrative of my own individual experience while a prisoner in the hands of the 
enemy, and also during the long and anxious days of my successful escape. For 
this, the requests of valued friends among the old members of the Regiment must 
be my excuse. Bespeaking a large measure of indulgence for the imperfections of 
the work, I am most respectfully, 

THE READER S HUMBLE SERV T.

" upon the Commonwealth, by the President of the United 
" States, for thirty Companies of Infantry, to serve for three 
" years, or during the war ; " also made known that " ten of 
" these companies will go to compose the 34th Regiment," 
" which will be recruited in the Counties of Worcester, Hamp- 
kt den, Hampshire, Franklin, and Berkshire, and will go into 
u Camp at the Agricultural Fair Grounds, near the City of 
" Worcester ; said camp to be designated Camp John E. Wool, 
" in honor of Major General Wool, of the U. S. army." 

The order provided for the selection and commissioning of 
the line officers by His Excellency; directed the immediate 
recruiting of the men ; gave directions as to the character, and 
amount of expenses which would be allowed; as to the trans 
portation of recruits to camp ; the procurement of all necessary 
blanks and papers ; the age of recruits, the formalities 
attending the enlistment of minors and announced that 
the officer to command the camp would be designated by 
subsequent Special Order. On the 3d day of June, by " Special 
Order," said Headquarters, William S. Lincoln, of the City 
of Worcester, was designated and appointed Lieutenant Colonel 
of the 34th Regiment; and directed to assume command of 
said Camp John E. Wool ; to use his utmost exertions for 
the speedy organization of said regiment; and for that purpose, 
he was authorized to make requisitions upon the Adjutant 
General for such camp "equipage, clothing, subsistence, and 
transportation, as he might require, and as was provided in 
General Order, No. IT, present series."

14 THE THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Clothed with this authority, after a personal interview with 
his Excellency, Lieutenant Colonel Lincoln addressed himself to 
the task before him. There were upon the files of the Execu 
tive Department at the State House, letters from gentlemen, in 
many towns of the territory within which the regiment was 
required to be raised, the writers of which asked to be com 
missioned in the service, and pledged themselves, in case their 
wishes were granted, to forward to camp wdthout delay, some 
whole companies, others, more limited number of Volunteers. 
Letters were at once written, and forwarded to these gentle 
men, and correspondence opened with others, with a view to 
secure their influence and services in the work. Charles W. 
Elwell, of Greenfield, who was met at the State House, whither 
he had gone with a modest request to be allowed to recruit 
for the regiment, ivithout exacting promise of reward, was 
given the authority he sought, and was the first person actually 
at work. Applicants for such authority crowded fast upon the 
heels of each other, and in a very short space of time, a com 
petent force was engaged. At the outset it was deemed best 
to confine each officer to a certain specified territory, within 
which the recruits for his particular company were to be 
secured; but the repeated complaints that these territorial 
limits were disregarded in the zeal to obtain volunteers, soon 
led to the countermanding of the order, and thereafter 
recruiting went 011 without reference to town or county lines. 

Authority to recruit for the regiment was given every person 
who applied therefor, but each was distinctly informed that 
success in securing a given number of Volunteers would not, 
of itself, entitle the party to a commission. On the other hand, 
all were made to understand that they would, in turns, be 
called into camp after it was opened, and that the granting of 
commissions to any rank would depend largely upon their 
ability to drill, discipline and command men. The wisdom of 
this rule was shown by its practical working. As an instance ; 
among the letters and files in the Executive Department, was 
one from a worthy gentleman, setting forth his ability to bring 
into camp at a short notice, a full company of men, and 
requesting authority to recruit, and also, a commission as 



ORGANIZATION, RENDEZVOUS, ETC. 15 

captain. He received the authority to recruit. Weeks 
passed, and although aided by two Lieutenants, he had but the 
merest skeleton of a company. He was called upon to come 
into camp for duty. Soon after reporting, he was detailed as 
" officer of the day." " What s this? " asked he of his lieuten 
ant, showing his little triangular billet! "That! that s a detail!" 
" A detail ! and what s a detail ? " "why" said E, as he opened 
it, " this is a detail for you as officer of the day for to-morrow," 
" Officer of the day ! officer of the day ! What s that ? " and 
as E began to explain, Captain M s head began to ache, and he 
took the next train for home, and was never again seen in a 
camp of the 34th. 

Headquarters were established and camp opened, on the 
12th day of June, because of representations by the recruit 
ing officers, of the difficulty of holding their men after 
enlistment, for want of suitable facilities for feeding and 
housing them. Charles P. Trumbull, of Worcester, was ap 
pointed Quarter Master Sergeant; and George W. Marsh, 
of Leominster, Commissary Sergeant. By the midnight train 
from the West, on the next day (13th), Captain Potter, o 
Pittsfield, reached town with thirty men, and marched them 
into camp. 

Meantime an unpleasant state of affairs existed, in reference 
to the position of Quarter-Master. This had been offered 
by the Lieutenant Colonel commanding, to F. B. Rice of Wor 
cester ; who, furnished with his letter of appointment, went down 
to the State House for confirmation, and to be commissioned. 
But His Excellency had already designated and commissioned 
Charles W. Rowland of Plymouth, as such officer, and Mr. Rice 
returned with such report. Remonstrance was made to His 
Excellency. It was urged that while the western counties 
were looked to to furnish the men to compose the regiment, 
it was but sheer justice that the officers should come from 
the same territory; and further, that inasmuch as this officer 
would form a part of the military family of the commanding 
officer of the regiment, it was his right to designate him. But 
remonstrance was of no avail, and Rice was subsequently 
attached, in the same capacity, to the 36th. 



16 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Samuel F. Woods of Worcester, was appointed at the same 
time to be adjutant, and was commissioned accordingly. 

On the 17th day of June squad drills were ordered, arid 
guard was mounted at the entrance of the camp. 21 tents 
were erected. By the 27th of the same month, the number 
of men had so increased that all the regular duties of camp 
were initiated. 

June 29th. The number of men in camp to-day was between 
one and two hundred ; composing parts of seven companies 
and occupying forty-three tents. Sentinels were placed around 
the camp to-day for the first time. 

Recruiting, though progressing fairly fast for the season of 
the year, and in a region so largely agricultural as was this 
from which the men of the 34th were to be drawn, was yet 
far too slow for the ardor of the Governor ; and tables, pre 
pared by his direction, were, July 7th, issued, showing the 
number of men each city and town should raise to meet 
their proportion of the call which had been made upon the 
State. In addition, the Mayors of cities and Selectmen of 
towns were authorized to act as recruiting agents, as well 
for the new organizations as for those already in the field, 
and were urged to the most strenuous exertions to fill the 
quotas assigned to them. A premium of $2 was authorized 
to be paid to every person who should bring in an accepted 
recruit. 

July 2d. To secure more rapid enlistment, one month s 
pay and 25, or one-fourth of the governmental bounty was 
authorized to be paid to all recruits at the time of their 
muster in. 

1th. Religious services were held in camp to-day for the 
first time, Rev. Dr. Hill officiating. 

10th. Dr. R. R. Clarke, of Whitinsville, was appointed 
surgeon to the regiment, and ordered to report at camp without 
delay. 

14A One hundred men were mustered into service to-day 
by Captain Graham, U. S. A. 

For the last week or ten days many public meetings to 
encourage recruiting have been held, and bounties ($100 



ORGANIZATION, RENDEZVOUS, ETC. 17 

generally,) offered to such as would volunteer for the service. 
Under this stimulus, recruiting has been quite active ; and now, 
the 19th day of July, there were in camp belonging to the 34th, 
between four and five hundred men. In addition, there were a 
goodly number enlisted for the 35th, besides some for the 36th 
regiments, all of whieh were ordered to report to tlie command 
ing officer of the 34th. In all there were sixty-six tents up. 
Seventy-three recruits, from the town of Westfield, under 
escort of the Westfield Fire Engine Co., preceded by the 
Westfield Cornet Band, the whole commanded by Rev. Mr. 
Bowler, of the same town, caused quite an excitement as they 
marched through the streets of the city, to camp. 

Besides these, twenty-three were received from Pittsfield: 
twenty-two from Millbury ; sixteen from Shirley ; eleven from 
North Adams, and smaller parties from Holyoke, Southbridge 
and Springfield. 

21s. " Lieutenants Lincoln and Cobb are commissioned as 
mustering officers for the regiment; and henceforth we shall 
have less difficulty in holding men who repent after enlistment, 
and run away before we can get a regular officer to muster 
them/ 

On the 22d, twenty-two men came in from Westfield ; 
Captain Cooley brought in eighteen from Pittsfield, and sixteen 
were added to Captain Holden s Company. 

Charles B. Cutler, of Worcester, appointed Sergeant Major, 
reported for duty. 

23&lt;i. Eighty-six recruits came in to-day from Berkshire 
County ; this, exclusive of forty-five from Pittsfield, for the 
Allen Guard, Capt. Cooley, In addition, there were eighteen 
from Grafton, and seventeen from Southbridge ; not all of 
these, however, were for the 34th. We received thirty-two 
recruits from Spencer, who were escorted by the Leicester Fire 
Engine Co., preceded by the Leicester Cornet Band, all under 
command of Luther Hill, Esq., Selectman of that town. After 
being mustered in, they were assigned to Company E, and 
given a furlough for a few days to enable them to arrange 
suitably for their absence. 

Captain Potter s Company numbered seventy-five; Captain 



18 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

H. W. Pratt s, (the Worcester Light Infantry), 70, and the 
Company from Westfield, 70. 

The men, although unarmed, were now exercised in move 
ments of the company. We have had in camp for some time, 
Enfield rifles, which have been sent up for our use ; but the 
Lieutenant 6olonel Commanding keeps them boxed up, refusing 
to issue them until it is established certainly that Springfield 
rifles cannot be procured. 

"Companies A, B, and I, are full; the number of men has 
so increased (amounting to 600), that battalion drills are 
ordered. 

Some of the recruits from Southbridge were rejected upon 
examination of our own officers ; as the newspapers will have it, 
"for the most trivial defects, loss of teeth and stiff joints of 
fingers.* 

" For the purpose of encouraging recruiting generally, and 
" more especially filling its quota, a public meeting of the citi- 
" zens of Worcester was called for the afternoon of this day, 
" the 26th. All places of business were closed, many of them 
" being profusely decorated with flags ; and amidst the firing 
" of guns, and the ringing of bells, thousands gathered on the 
" public common. The Mayor called the meeting to order ; 
" spirited and eloquent addresses were made by Governor 
" Andrew, Hon. A. H. Bullock, John B. Gough, and others. 
" Colonel Wells, late of the 1st Massachusetts, who had come to 
" the city to visit the regiment, which, it is understood he is to 
" command, was introduced to the meeting, and received with 
" loud and hearty cheers. In his address the Colonel alluded to 
" the losses in the old regiments, as the result, not so much of 
" disease and battle, as of what he called the wasting processes. 
" Men in the first regiments were not examined with sufficient 
" care, and have been sent home because of physical disability, 
" which should have caused their rejection." 

Aug. 1st. Owing to the influence of the many public 
meetings held in the different towns, and to the activity of 
the municipal officers, recruiting has been going on with great 
success, and during the past few days large accessions have 
been made to the regiment. The number reported to-day was 



ORGANIZATION, RENDEZVOUS, ETC. 19 

nine hundred and twenty. But there has been greater zeal 
shown to fill the quotas assigned to the various towns, than 
judgment displayed in selecting the recruits, who are sent into 
camp. This has operated hardly upon the officers of the 
organization, and subjected them to a great deal of undeserved 
censure. For instance, a man who had enlisted in another 
regiment early in the war, who became crazy, and had been 
committed to a hospital for the insane in August 1861, being 
discharged therefrom only about four months ago, was rejected 
by the proper regimental officers, after examination. This was 
spoken of in the daily press as an unwarranted stretch of 
authority, and the case was described as that of a man who, 
"from the effects of a slow fever, had been for a few days out of 
his mind." Again the same authority stated that " half of the 
Westfield Volunteers, and some thirty of those from Pittsfield, 
had been rejected;" while the truth was that but three of the 
Pittsfield men were rejected, and those, not by the Medical, but 
by the mustering officers ; while all of the Westfield recruits, 
save one who had "snakes in his boots" were accepted. Again, 
it was charged that " Granby raised her full quota of eleven 
men, and sent them to Worcester last week, and had eight men 
rejected by the "numbskull examiner ;" while in fact, only four 
from Crranby had presented themselves to the proper officers 
of the regiment, all of whom had been accepted. 

The " man of the snakes, is causing us some trouble. Rejected 
by us, after a careful examination, he tramped over the 
highways to his home, and was taken by the town authority 
to Boston, where he was presented to the Governor, as a man 
who was anxious to enlist, but " ivhom the 34/i wouldn t have" 
The Lieutenant Colonel commanding was summoned to head 
quarters for explanation. The truth of the whole matter was 
this : On one side was the surgeon, a man of mature judgment, 
of long practice, of acknowledged professional skill, and in 
good repute ; who had had experience in the army, and knew 
the wants of the service ; and who knew well that many men 
who enlisted in the first regiments, were unfit for duty, when 
they were mustered in ; and that they were discharged 
for disabilities which existed at the time of their enlistment, 



20 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

after the government had sheltered, paid, doctored, nursed and 
fed them for months. 

" There is perfect accord in this matter, among the officers 
who are charged with the duty of raising the regiment ; and 
the course adopted in examining and accepting recruits, will 
be adhered to as long as the responsibility rests upon them." 

21st. Two men, accepted by the Regimental Officers, were 
rejected to-day by Captain Cooley, U. S. A. mustering officer, 
after examination. Instead of "snakes in their boots" they had 
"Jto." 

We had two recruits to-day, from territory assigned to the 
83d Regiment. They are brothers and were admitted to this 
regiment by virtue of a special dispensation in their favor, 
issued from the office of the Adjutant General of the State. 
" They would not enlist in the 33d, and unless they could have 
" a situation in the 34th, would remain at home." Inasmuch as 
the situation they stipulated for was merely a place in the 
ranks of a good company, there was no difficulty in acceding to 
their wishes. They are good looking, well meaning, but some 
what queer; and have reported with a goodly supply of citizen s 
clothing, a nice, large iron bound trunk and a neiv cotton umbrella 
for each. 

"We are to be in readiness to move next week. Our mus 
tering officer pronounces "the 34th to be the finest looking 
body of men ever organized into a regiment in this State ; they 
being " all picked men, selected with care, after a rigid examina 
tion." This commendation, by one who knows of what he 
speaks, goes far to satisfy the examining and mustering officers 
of the regiment of the wisdom of the course adopted by them." 

6th. The regiment was reviewed to-day by the Governor, 
who was accompanied by the members of his staff, and Colonel 
Wells. Meanwhile the men are still unarmed. The Enfield 
rifles are still unpacked, and another attempt is being made 
to exchange them for those of Springfield make. 

12th. " The day has been an eventful one to us, marked as it 
was, by the presentation of a national flag to the regiment, 
by our lady friends in the city. The delivery was prefaced by 
an eloquent address from Hon. Alexander H. Bullock. The 



ORGANIZATION, RENDEZVOUS, ETC. 21 

flag was received by the Colonel with appropriate remarks, 
and, as it was given to the hands of the color bearer the regi 
ment welcomed it with hearty cheers. Hon. Judge Russell took 
advantage of the opportunity to present to the Colonel a horse, 
suitably caparisoned, the gift of his friends and late associates 
of the "Boston Bar." % While the men were embodied, " Orders" 
were promulgated directing the regiment to march to-morrow. 
" Even now the Enfield rifles are in their boxes and the men 
without arms ; but the Springfield guns are on the way to us, 
and upon their receipt to-night, will be at once distributed." 

13A. The regiment did not move to-day, as ordered. Tents 
were struck, camp and garrison equipage was upon teams; 
much of it had, in fact, been delivered at the railroad station ; 
every needed preparation had been completed, and the men 
in line, ready to march, when, at 2 p. M., a special order was 
received, countermanding the movement. Precisely the reason 
for this, nobody seems to know, though gossip has it, that the 
33d couldn t get ready, and it wasn t quite "en regie " to allow 
the 34th to precede it. Probably this does not fully account 
for it. As the men were embodied, the opportunity was im 
proved, and the first " Dress Parade of the regiment was 
had. 

14/i. Had we moved yesterday, as ordered, "the boys" would 
have been compelled to march away, carrying with them the 
broken promises of the Government. "As it is now, everything 
is right." The pay master arrived after our line was dismissed, 
and paid off six companies of the regiment, and is now 
engaged in paying the remaining four companies. " We of the 
Field and Staff, are to live a while longer on faith, as there 
is no money for us." Notwithstanding, we move to-morrow 
according to orders just received.

15th. We have eaten the goodly and bountiful collation 
furnished for us by our Lady friends of the city, and with hearts 
stirred by varied feelings have said our last "good lyes" and 
now stand in line for the last time upon our Camp ground, 
1,027 strong. We wait only for the appearance of our Colonel 
to move. Preceded by a band of music, we are to march in 
column of companies, to "the Common," where we are to take 
transportation for Washington. Our route through the city is 
by way of Agricultural, Elm, Chestnut, Harvard, and Main 
Streets. The " Spy " shall tell the story : 

" Along its whole march, the Regiment was greeted by the 
" waving of handkerchiefs, and by hearty hurrahs, and by all 
"the evidences of profound sympathy, arid universal admira- 
" tion which men receive who enter a contest by all their coun- 
" try s wishes blest. Our streets were not thronged as on some 
" former occasions, when regiments have left us, only because 
" this went off on such short notice. The brief notice also pre- 
" vented that full preparation on the part of the railroad 
" which would have been had, and which had to do with the 
" wearisome delay of the troops on the Common. All thought 
" the officers of the regiment, on the whole, made a creditable 
"appearance. Of the Lieutenant-Colonel [Lincoln], no word is 
" required in Worcester. In courage and conduct, he will never 
" be wanting ; nor would we omit a reference to Captain H. W. 
" Pratt of Company A, another of our citizens. He won 
" laurels, as Captain of the Infantry, in the three month s ser- 
" vice, and has always been true to every occasion since. Such 
" a past is a guaranty for the future. Major Bowman has also 
"been tried by battle, and the severe ordeal of the prison. 
" His promotion is conclusive of the honorable manner in which 
"he endured both, and also of his military ability. The 
"Colonel [Wells] too, seemed the right man in the right place. 
" The universal feeling is, that he has really earned the place he 
"holds. Where there is fighting to be done, we know, and his 
" men know he will be there. He knows also, we have good 
" reason to believe, that he has under him a body of men worthy 
" of a brave and high-souled leader. That God s blessing may 
" be upon him and them, is the fervent prayer of every loyal 
"heart." 



24 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

The delay upon the common above alluded to was trying in 
the extreme, and withal, in a degree demoralizing. Well 
wishing and sympathetic friends crowded upon the ranks, in 
too many instances distributing "pocket pistols" loaded with 
ammunition not prescribed in the service. Quarter-Master 
McKim of the United States, and Reed and Brigham of the 
State service, were present to see to our embarkation. There 
was disagreement between these officers and those of the 
railroad, as to the manner of our transportation ; the former 
desiring to divide the train, the latter insisting that the 
regiment should be forwarded in one line of cars. Quarter- 
Master Brigham cut the knot by separating the first nine cars, 
and at once dispatching them, having on board the right wing, 
under charge of the Lieutenant-Colonel. The remainder of the 
regiment followed close behind. The run to Norwich, and by 
steamer across the sound, was rapid, pleasant, and easy ; the 
men, with very few exceptions, being quiet and orderly. In 
the darkness of the night, Finn, of A., took French leave of 
us sometime between leaving the cars at Norwich and embark 
ing on the boat. As we passed by the cities of Brooklyn and 
New York, the whistles of the boats on the water and cheers 
from the throngs which crowded the banks of the East river, 
and the various tug and ferry boats were enough to frighten 
the living and waken the dead. Gliding steadily on, we 
reached our dock at Jersey City and disembarked without 
delay. Here a long line of close box cars was drawn up to 
receive us, and clambering up, and in, we were soon again on 
our way. All through New Jersey our passage was greeted by 
hearty cheers. Philadelphia was reached in the afternoon. 
The regiment was warmly received and cordially welcomed at 
the " Cooper s shop refreshment rooms," where its members 
were greatly refreshed by baths and supper. At 9 P. M., 
through streets darkened by clouds of dust, we marched to the 
Baltimore depot, and seating ourselves again in box cars, were 
sped on our way. Bivouac fires along the track, and picket 
posts at bridges, and switches, served to remind us of the 
existence of war. 

Early on the morning of the 17th we reached Baltimore, 



ORGANIZATION, RENDEZVOUS, ETC. 25 



and, disembarking at the President Street depot, formed 
column of companies, and, to the horrid rub-a-dub of our 
untrained drum corps, made our way across the city by the 
route made memorable by the massacre of the 19th of April 
of the last year. It was as if it were a city of the dead. There 
were no greetings, rto cheers, nothing to break the silence 
which became oppressive. No flags waved from house-tops, or 
windows. Hardly a white person was seen on this long line of 
march. Lieutenant Lincoln, in command of the rear guard, 
was occasionally lost sight of, and some little anxiety was 
occasioned thereby. But we experienced no interruption, and 
in due time reached the Washington depot. The regiment 
here received an invitation to breakfast, which was accepted ; 
and at its close our Colonel received another invitation, this 
time to make a requisition upon the Government Quartermas 
ter for the breakfast which we had been invited to, which he 
also accepted, although a little ungraciously. Again we packed 
into still worse box cars than any occupied before, and were 
moved on our last stage to the Capital. 

Our train was a long one, and the engine of insufficient 
power, and we failed occasionally to make the up grades. 
While the engine was stopping at one of these grades, as the 
boys said " to catch breath," bedlam broke loose. While in 
camp Wool, many of the boys, disregarding friendly warning, 
had spent their money in purchasing revolvers, and now 
amused themselves by a little target practice, firing from the 
doors and the roofs of the cars. 

" Sergeant Major, said Colonel Wells, " give my compli 
ments to the officer of the day, and tell him to go through this 
train and confiscate every pistol he can find in the possession of 
an enlisted man. The fusilade ceased suddenly, and gradually 
a large pile of weapons, of every imaginable pattern, was 
gathered, to be stored by the Quarter-Master. 



CHAPTER II. 



WASHINGTON, ARLINGTON AND ALEXANDRIA. 

Washington was reached in the afternoon, and the regiment 
quartered for the night at the " Soldier s home." The next 
day, to the music of the " Marine Band," in heavy marching 
order, we moved to our destined camp of instruction in 
Virginia. On our passage by Willard s, we paid to General 
Corcoran of the 69th New York, who had just returned from 
imprisonment in Libbey, the honor of a marching salute. We 
halted to be addressed by him. Here we parted with Major 
Bowman, who not having been yet exchanged, declined to go 
farther. Soon resuming our march, we passed over Long 
Bridge, where the band was dismissed, and in the heat, and 
through clouds of dust, which nearly stifled us, late in the 
evening reached our camping ground. Lieut. Lincoln, with 
the rear guard, impressing into service a goodly number of 
hackney carriages, for the transportation of those who from the 
heat and dust couldn t or wouldn t walk, had hard duty to 
bring up the stragglers, and harder still to get rid of the jelius 
whose teams had been impressed. Tired and dirty, we closed 
to half distance, stacked arms, and spread our blankets for our 
first night s bivouac. Assistant Surgeon Thorndike caused no 
little merriment, as starting from his blanket in the dead of the 
night he enquired if his office bell didn t ring. 

Tuesday, Aug. ~\.9th. Tents are ordered to be pitched ; the 
order of the camp, conforming to the restricted space assigned 
to us. We are near " Hunter s Chapel " so called ; upon 
ground occupied by the rebel pickets, immediately after Bull 
Run, about midway between Arlington, arid Munson s Hill. 
Blenker s division was encamped here last winter, living in a 
sort of dog kennel fashion, in holes, dug some two or three feet 
deep in the ground, into which they must have crawled. The 



WASHINGTON, ARLINGTON AND ALEXANDRIA. 27 

roofing having been removed, the eye falls upon an accumu 
lation of rubbish and filth perfectly indescribable. The country 
around presents a picture of utter desolation. Houses in ruins, 
fruit trees stripped of foliage and bark by animals which have 
been picketed among them ; acres upon acres of forest trees, 
with their bare limbs and brown trunks, are tangled in inex 
tricable confusion, as they were felled to clear the range for the 
guns mounted upon the neighboring fortifications. 

Here is to be established a camp of instruction, (called 
camp Casey,) to which all new regiments from the East are to 
be ordered for drill and discipline. In our front, are already 
three Pennsylvania regiments, and one from New York ; on 
our left is our own 33d. 

Our first business is to police the ground, and squads are 
detailed for that purpose, as also to dig wells ; those formerly 
existing having been filled up by these Dutchmen, at their 
departure. There is no ivater within a mile and a half of our 
camp. 

19th. The work of cleaning our position, and getting into 
comfortable condition still goes on. Everybody, apparently, 
is bringing into camp boards to floor their tents, some procuring 
them by purchase, others not quite so legitimately. Lean, 
lank, gaunt visaged Virginians are thronging head quarters 
with complaints of depredations upon their premises. 

All work is stopped by receipt of orders to march in the 
morning, with two days cooked rations. 

At dress parade, Colonel Green of our 14th, and General 
Whipple were present, and complimented us upon our appear 
ance. 

2Qth. The colonel, who left for Washington immediately 
upon receipt of yesterday s marching orders, returned early 
this morning, accompanied by Maj. Bowman, who has been 
duly exchanged and transferred to the command of our 36th. 
The order for us to move is countermanded. This, upon the 
representation of Colonel Wells, and Maggi, of the 33d, which 
regiment was included in the order that raw, undisciplined, 
and undrilled as are the men of both commands, it would be 
little less than murder to send us into action, 



28 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 



Orders to inarch at once for Alexandria, there to take 
transportation for Catlett s station, reporting to General Banks, 
were received during the night, and this morning, all is bustle. 
Tents are struck, wagons loaded, ammunition distributed 
that is, all we had forty rounds of ball cartridges to a man, 
for by some singular fate, we find ourselves almost in the face 
of the enemy, without a percussion cap. We march ; first 
despatching the Quarter-master to Washington, with a requi 
sition for this indispensible part of a soldier s equipment. 
Winding among the ravines, our flag betrays our origin, and 
as we pass fort or encampment, the men of the different 
commands exchange hearty cheers. 

We reached Alexandria soon after noon: the boys suffering 
much from the combined heat and dust ; a few falling by the 
way ; and the colonel rode to the city to report in person our 
arrival. There was much lamentation at being compelled to 
leave our lumber, at least so much of it as had been paid for ; 
the officers of company F being chief mourners. 

22c?. The night has passed unconfortably enough, the boys 
lying upon their arms, on the embankment of the railroad, 
and the officers seeking the cover of box cars, or our own 
wagons, parked near by. A mule corral was in close neighbor 
hood, and to judge by the noise it was "full opera" night with 
the animals. One of the line officers, Lieutenant E. tells his 
experience of the night, thus. It commenced to rain, and as 
he had no umbrella, he crawled under one of the wagons for 
shelter. Rolling up in his blanket, with a stick of wood for 
a pillow, and getting into a little hollow, into which he just 
fitted, he was, after a while, lulled to sleep. Waking in the 
morning, he found himself hemmed in by a fellow lodger on 
each side. -" A man and a brother " lay snoring in front, and 
behind, a large dog was curled up against him. With his 
sword, the Lieutenant rapped the darkey across his shins, who, 
starting up with a howl, crawled hastily from the cover of the 
wagon, closely followed by the Lieutenant and dog. As they 
confronted each other, the darkey s eyes opened, he screeched 
out, "Lord G-od, it s an ossifer!" and, with one bound disap 
peared round an adjoining building, the dog, however, a little 
ahead. 



WASHINGTON, ARLINGTON AND ALEXANDRIA. 29 

Reveille call showed that some of the boys were absent, and 
Lieutenant G. was detailed, with a small party to patrol the 
neighboring streets, and arrest any of the regiment whom he 
might find. Coming across one of B s men who refused to halt 
when ordered, the Lieutenant fired, wounding the man slightly, 
and brought him into camp upon the arms of his party. A 
great deal of excitement was caused by the act, and arms were 
seized, and loud threats made by the men. But the drums 
were ordered to beat "to the color," "fall in" was shouted 
by officers; line was formed, and discipline prevailed. Tents 
were now ordered to be pitched, camp guard was mounted, 
and all became quiet. A large force, under the command of 
the Lieutenant Colonel, was now dispatched to patrol the 
neighboring streets and close all places where intoxicating 
liquors could be procured. 

Late in the evening the Quartermaster returned from Wash 
ington, with a supply of percussion caps for our muskets, and 
we learned from him, that the rebels raided upon Catlett s 
Station last night, capturing the baggage and part of Head 
Quarters staff, and killing or taking prisoners most of the guard 
at that point. 

What an escape for us ! Had transportation been furnished 
for us upon our arrival here, we should have been there without 
the means of -firing a shot. 

23r/. Our orders to report to General Banks are still in 
force ; but we are furnished no transportation. We have moved 
out from Alexandria, about three miles, and are encamped near 
Cloud s mills, directly upon the line of the railroad. On our 
left Hank, stands Fort Ward ; to our right, is Fort Ellsworth ; 
while on our right, but in the rear rises Fort Lyon, largest and 
most formidable of the three. A corn field in our rear fur 
nishes the only sign of cultivation within sight. From this, in 
spite of the protestations of the owner, our boys draw their 
supply of roasting ears and potatoes. Regimental General 
Orders, "Camp Worcester," directs squad and company drill 
in the morning ; Battalion drill to be followed by dress parade, 
for every afternoon. 

26th. Regimental General Orders require in future all 



30 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Line officers to be present at reveille and tattoo roll calls, and 
when not actually engaged on other duty, at all drills. Two 
days rations of hardtack and cooked meat to be kept in haver 
sacks, and forty rounds of ball cartridges, with ample supply of 
caps in the cartridge boxes. At each roll call, the men are to 
appear fully armed and equipped ; and commanders of compa 
nies are to make personal inspection of arms, equipments, 
cartridge boxes, cap pouches and haversacks, previous to each 
day s parade. 

We are required to furnish a daily detail of two full Com 
panies, for patrol duty in Alexandria, and one Company is 
detailed for our own camp guard. 

We are now completely surrounded by the veterans of the 
Army of the Peninsula, who have gathered round us for the 
past few days. The railroad is occupied by long trains, and 
the turnpike be}^ond constantly clouded by dust from columns 
of troops moving slowly out to Centerville and Manassas. In 
the evening the scene to our front is indescribably beautiful. 
Every hill and valley is sparkling with bivouac fires. The 
signal lights which rise far to the front and are repeated from 
station to station, till met by answering flashes from the great 
dome of the Capitol, throw a veil of enchantment over the 
whole scene. The songs of the men in near by encampments, 
are loud and harsh, but from far off bivouac fall upon the ear, 
sweet and mellow. 

The 15th Massachusetts marched by this afternoon, and is in 
bivouac about a mile to our front. Some of our officers have 
gone out to give their acquaintances greeting. In the ranks 
they found Captain B s brother Frank, whom they brought 
back with them ; without shoes, stockings or shirt, having had 
nothing to eat for the last three days but two pieces of hard 
tack, his condition was pitiable. But he was the same gallant, 
plucky fellow he ever was, and with his necessities supplied 
from our stores, he went his way in good spirits. 

28th. Our drills, which of necessity were suspended by the 
occupation of all available ground by McClellan s army, are 
now resumed, though under difficulties, as the many dead horses 
and mules which lie festering on the ground, form * obstacles 



WASHINGTON, ARLINGTON AND ALEXANDRIA. 31 

in front," and the innumerable sinks give occasion for frequent 
movements by the flank. 

Lieutenant Colonel Underwood, with Lieutenant Vose, and 
Colonel Maggi with Captain Wyman, all of them belonging 
to our 33d, made usji visit to-day, and looked over our camp. 
The two latter remained to sup with the Field and Staff. Of 
course, discussion followed upon the events of the last few 
days, and naturally enough, opinions differed as to the merits 
and general capacity of the late and present commanders of 
our army. Wells, an ardent friend and warm admirer of 
the present one, was thoroughly convinced that now matters 
would all go smoothly and well ; while Maggi was equally sure 
that " McClellan was not fit to hold a Corporal s warrant in the 
33d." 

31s. We were all a good deal excited yesterday by the 
heavy canonading in front, which continued all day, the last 
report being heard about 8 p. M. ; and the marching and coun 
termarching of troops by our camp for the past day or two has 
given rise to much speculation. Long columns, of all arms, on 
their way to the front, fairly darkened the u pike," until night 
before last, when staff officers and orderlies passed out from 
the city, and soon the weary men were retracing their steps. 
" Little Mac," as the " boys " call him, rode out and met the 
troops as they were marching back. As he was recognized, 
caps were thrown up, blankets and shelter tents were waived, 
and the air fairly shook with the cheers given* for him. 

To-day the railroad is burdened with broken engines and 
cars partly burned by the Rebels a night or two ago, at 
Manassas, and now being drawn back to the city. A train of 
rebel prisoners has passed by on its way to Alexandria. 
Destitute as our boys from the Peninsula were, they were 
clothed in fine linen, compared with these fellows. 

To-day we have been " inspected and mustered for pay." 

An order from the military Governor of Alexandria read to 
the regiment, at parade, afforded us all much amusement. 

Just in rear of our camp is a race way or canal, broad, 
uncovered, and full of water. The men of the Peninsula 
army, covered with dirt, sat down on its banks to pick from 



32 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

their bodies the vermin which infested them, and wash 
themselves and their dirty clothes in its water. 

The overflow from the sinks of all these thousands of troops 
runs into it. Within stones throw, in plain sight, upon its 
banks, lie now the swollen and decaying carcasses of more than 
twenty horses and mules, to take no account of the score or 
more which lie rotting upon the plains near by. And the order 
of the military Governor, after reciting that from this source 
alone, the city draws its supply of pure water, threatens with 
severe punishment, any of our command who shall be found 
guilty of polluting it. 

The men are now served with soft bread in lieu of hard tack. 
The line officers fare well ; some of them living quite sump 
tuously. Company E s officers live like fighting cocks ; Cap 
tain Bacon having brought with him from the 13th, his negro 
servant, a capital cook, good waiter, and most adroit and success 
ful forager. The Field and Staff get along pretty well, consid 
ering all things. Breakfast, dinner, and tea resemble each 
other so much, that, were it not for the hour, any one might 
doubt to which he was called. Coffee at each, and salt mack 
erel and potatoes at nearly all. The Colonel and Chaplain have 
thus far been masters of the butter, which is, nevertheless, 
decidedly strong ; but the rest confess themselves beaten. 
Milk we get in small quantity at ten cents a quart ; cheese from 
the " Sutler," at forty cents the pound. 

The Chaplain has been afflicted with a severe cold, for a day 
or two past, although he keeps about. He is a good deal dis 
turbed, however, by a little difficulty he has experienced in 
obtaining supplies, as witness ; " Colonel," said he at the mess 
table this evening, " Colonel, I wish you would issue an order 
that I should wear shoulder straps." "What for? what rank do 
you claim? what need have you for shoulder straps ?" asked 
one or another. " Well, I draw pay equal to that of a Captain 

of Cavalry, and" "Hold there, " You can t rank me!" 

interrupted the Adjutant, "And I can t get any whiskey unless 
I wear shoulder straps," continued the Chaplain. " Can t get 
whiskey unless you wear shoulder straps ! How s that ? and 
what do you want whiskey for ? " " Why Colonel, the Surgeon 



WASHINGTON, ARLINGTON AND ALEXANDRIA. 33 

prescribed whiskey and molasses for my cold. I have a hard 
one, you know ; and this morning I went to Alexandria to get 
my flask filled. Going into a saloon, I asked for some, and was 
refused, with the statement that they did not sell any. But 
that I did not believe* so I hung round there, and pretty soon 
I saw a Lieutenant go in, hand out his flask and get it filled. I 
then went in, and asked again to have mine filled and was 
again refused. " We don t sell whiskey here," said the bar 
keeper. But, said I, "you just sold some to that officer!" "Oh, 
yes ! We sell to officers, but we can t let enlisted men have 
any." " Ah, well, if that s all the trouble, I am an officer." 
"You an officer! Of what? Where are your straps? That 
story won t pass muster, here." And so, Colonel, I couldn t get 
my whiskey, and I want an order to wear straps." And he got 
his order and 

Sept. 2d. Immense wagon trains are passing from the front 
into Alexandria ; and, in the distance, we can see the glittering 
bayonets of a large column of troops, moving, as rumor has it, 
toward Washington. 

A strong guard of "ours" is stationed on the Pike, with 
orders to stop and turn back all stragglers from the army. 
McDowell s division, only, is allowed to march past us to the 
rear. 

Orders just received, direct us to be in readiness to move at 
a moment s notice. The Colonel has left for Washington. The 
boys are putting their arms in order, and the cooks are busied 
round their fires, preparing the rations for our haversacks. 
Still, in the midst of the preparation for our anticipated move 
ment, and the excitement consequent upon the late fighting so 
near us, all suspend labor to gather around some straggling 
soldier or contraband from the front, and listen to his story. 

6th. Bank s division has moved ; and we are still here. All 
eyes turn anxiously toward each rider who approaches, in 
hopes of receiving orders to report to that General for duty. 

Our work here has been, and is severe, irregular, and irksome. 
Our regular daily detail for patrol in the city is for three hun 
dred men and ten officers. Yesterday we were called upon for 
five full companies in addition ; a requisition we were unable to 



34 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

fill. And we furnish, almost daily, large parties for fatigue in 
Alexandria. Besides, we are required to picket a line some 
three miles long, in advance of our position. 

Thus far the weather has been very pleasant, but the nights 
are becoming chilly. Diarrhoea is somewhat prevalent among 
us, and we have a few cases of Dysentery. We have lost two 
men by death, and one, Sergeant Fitzpatrick, of company D, 
by desertion. Though not much of a soldier, the Sergeant s 
singular ideas, and quaint forms of command, afford us much 
amusement. 

Once before, he has been absent without leave ; and to the 
reprimand of his Captain, delivered himself as follows: "Indeed, 
Captain, I presume there might be cases, in which you would 
much prefer that a man should take upon himself the responsi 
bility of running guard, rather than trouble you with an appli 
cation for a pass ; as, for instance, where the man felt a neces 
sity for leaving camp, and you an obligation to refuse him the 
privilege." We are bound to suppose that to the mind of the 
Sergeant the emergency has arisen. 

5th. Yesterday we sent to Alexandria four companies for 
duty ; one of which was forwarded to Washington, as part escort 
at the burial ceremonies of General Stevens, killed in one of the 
recent engagements. Those of us who remained in camp were 
much gratified to have from our Chaplain, at dress parade, an 
assurance that "if we lived pure lives, and did our duty faith 
fully, we would all be remembered, upon our return home, by 
being elected Selectmen or Overseers of the Poor of our respec 
tive towns." We have struck our Sibley tents, in anticipa 
tion of an order to march, and the boys are under their 
shelters. But, as we can t procure storage for our Sibleys in 
Alexandria, unless marching orders reach us soon, we shall 
pitch them again, as the nights are getting very chilly. We 
have lost two more men. As much as we were blamed for our 
rigid examination when recruiting, we have quite a considerable 
number of men whom we ought not to have accepted into the 
Regiment, and whom we must soon send home. 

1th. Hon. Henry Wilson, P. Emory Aldrich, and Henry S. 
Washburn, of Worcester, and Messrs. Marshall and Nourse, of 



WASHINGTON, ARLINGTON AND ALEXANDRIA, 35 

Westboro, visited us to-day. These latter gentlemen are on a 
tour to the various Massachusetts Regiments, bearing comforts 
to the men in the hospitals. Their faces served to gladden 
those of us wlib yet remain well. The Regiment, under 
command of the Lieutenant Colonel, made its first appearance 
in Alexandria to-day; being ordered there for review and 
inspection by the Military Governor of the city. It received 
complimentary notice from General Slough for its good 
appearance. 

The Colonel, who during its absence from camp had returned 
from Darnestown, left again for Washington and a visit to 
General Banks. 

9th. By the departure of older troops we are again left in 
advance, and have to picket our front/ A scare in the 
city led to orders to us to fall back behind the guns of Fort 
Ellsworth ; and we now tenant " Camp Slough" so called, 
not so much in honor of the General of that name, as because 
of the character of the ground we occupy. It has been 
occupied as a camp for Cavalry, and the amount of dirt and 
filth accumulated upon it, would astonish one unacquainted 
, with the army. By sweeping, shoveling, arid carting away, it 
has been made endurable. 

12th Broke camp and moved about a mile to the front, 
under orders to report to General Grover our own, the 33d 
Massachusetts, llth New Jersey, and 120th New York, all new 
regiments, are to form a new brigade. 

Our quarters are upon ground formerly belonging to General 
Cooper once our own, now, Adjutant General of the rebel 
army. 

The remains of former fruit and vegetable and flower gardens 
can be traced ; but not a fence, nor a tree, nor a shrub is left. 
My own tent is pitched where formerly was a strawberry bed ; 
the Surgeon s stands upon what is left of an extensive 
rhaspberry plat; feeble shoots of flowering shrubs struggling 
through the hard trodden soil, betray the extent of former 
ornamental grounds. 

As has been our lot hitherto, with one exception, our camp 
is upon ground heretofore occupied by Cavalry; and the 



36 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

luxuriant growth of " pig weed," suggests to " the boys " its 
appropriate name : although by orders from headquarters it is 
officially named " Camp Grover." 

A mile to the rear stands a large brick building, noted before 
these sad days as "Fairfax Female Seminary, " now used for 
a hospital, and fitted with 2,500 beds. Close to our front is a 
small unpainted house, occupied for a while last winter by 
Colonel Meagher with his wife, but now tenanted by a low 
down white and his family, who claim to be union. 

With no crops of any kind to harvest, no horse, no cow, no 
hay, no grain, no pig, no poultry, no fire wood, nor any means 
of getting any, they look calmly and indifferently to the coming 
on of cold weather. 

"Can I get a little milk of you?" asked Lieutenant S., 
to-day, of the good lady of the house. "Milk! milk! and where 
would the milk come from," asked she in her turn, " when 
we ve got na ry cowl No, we don t have any milk now, but 
there s some whiskey you can have if you want." " Oh ! then 
you keep a little whiskey, do you?" asked the Captain. "Oh, 
yes ! we always keep that, said she ; there s near a barrel full 
over there ! " "A barrel full of whiskey ! A barrel full ! " 
exclaimed the Lieutenant. " That s a pretty good supply, is nt 
it?" "Well! what s a barrel full of whiskey in a family 
where there s no cow ! " asked she, and the Captain gave it up, 
the conundrum, I mean, not the whiskey. 

How those of us who were at headquarters at the time, 
enjoyed an interview which has just terminated, between 
Colonels Wells and Maggi. The 34th was the first regiment 
to reach this new ground, and Colonel Wells at once made 
headquarters in this house of General Cooper s. Maggi, who 
soon rode up, came hurrying in, bustling about, now up stairs, 
now down, from one room to another, till at length he 
addressed Wells with the remark that he had selected his 
quarters, and suggested that perhaps he (Wells), had better 
choose rooms for himself. "Ah!" asked Wells, "which rooms 
do you propose to occupy, Colonel Maggi ? " " These two" said 
Maggi, pointing to "them." "Those two," said Wells, "why, 
those are the very ones I have just taken for my own use ! " 



WASHINGTON, ARLINGTON AND ALEXANDRIA. 37 

" Well, yes ! " said Maggi, but then I had not come up ! now ! 
" But .now" said Wells; "Why, Colonel, I suppose you won t 
dispute my right to the first claim as ranking officer ; " 
" Ranking me ! ranking me ! " fairly screamed Maggi, " and I 
commanding the 33d, while you have the 34th ! But upon 
comparing proofs, Wells - commission was a day the oldest, and 
Maggi, in a rage, flung himself out of the house, and mounting 
his horse, spurred away toward Washington, leaving us of the 
34th convulsed with laughter. 

16* A. The brigade is broken up ! Maggi returned from 
Washington yesterday, with orders to report, with his command, 
to General Slough for provost duty in Alexandria. 



CHAPTER III. 



FORT LYON COUNCIL OF ADMISTRATION GUARD DUTY 

SICKNESS A SCARPS MULE TEAMS GENERAL 

REVIEW PROMOTIONS. 

General orders of this date assign Colonel Wells to the 
" command of Fort Lyon and its defences." In communicating 
the order, Colonel Wells directs "Lieutenant Colonel Lincoln 
to move his command at once, and occupy the ground lately 
occupied by the 69th New York." Here we now lie, in what 
Wells calls a camp of magnificent distances. For the first 
time, we are not cramped for room. Company streets are 
thirty feet wide ; one side covered by the Sibleys ; Cook houses 
are forty feet to the rear ; Line officers tents still forty-five feet 
in rear of these, and the Field and Staff about midway between 
these and the parapets of the Fort. To the left and in rear of 
these last, are pitched the hospital tents. On the right and in 
line with the company cook houses, are the Sutler s quarters. 
At the left flank are the guard tents ; in rear of these the 
qartermaster and commissary store houses; and still in rear of 
these are the stables. The ground covered by our camp has 
been thoroughly policed ; that occupied by the men s tents 
spaded deep and turned over. Numerous springs bubble up in 
the ravines near camp, but the water is not good, and the men 
of the companies are engaged in digging wells near their cook 
houses. At short distance in front run the sluggish waters of 
Hunting Creek. Regimental general orders directing the 
internal economy of the camp, provide for its daily sweeping 
from guard line to line of parade ; burying outside of our 
lines of all cooks refuse ; daily cleansing of stables, and 
grounds adjoining ; and the covering of all excrement in the 
sinks with fresh earth each morning. All this to be done 



FORT LYON AND VICINITY. 39 

by occupants of the guard house, if any, if not, by detail 
from each company. 

20th. We have occupied our present camp four days : have 
scraped up, and carted off twenty-seven four-horse wagon 
loads of filth and rubbish. Yet, although the camp in 
its whole extended surface, is .daily thoroughly swept, we 
are not clean. The 33d laugh at our continued policing, 
but just at present, cleanliness is of more account than 
godliness. 

Two hundred of our men, with proper compliment of officers, 
are daily employed in digging a line of rifle pits, connecting 
this post, and Forts Ward and Worth ; it having been 
discovered, now twelve months after their construction, that 
the valley between them is not commanded by the guns of 
either of these works. Nothing however is allowed to interfere 
with our regular daily company and battalion drills. 

23d We had quite a little scare last night. About mid 
night, a cavalry man dashed into camp and reported that our 
picket line had been forced. The men were turned out at once, 
and stood to their arms, till day light. Our own officers, this 
morning, report that a cavalry vidette, hearing a noise in his 
front, and unable, on account of the darkness, to ascertain the 
cause of it, discharged his piece ; his companion fired at the 
flash of his comrade s carbine, and both, wheeling their horses, 
rode in upon the Infantry line ; one continuing his race till he 
reached our camp. An alarm so needlessly given is provoking, 
but the prompt and steady conduct of our men is gratifying. 
A council of administration is appointed by General Order of 
this date ; members composing it, Lieutenant Colonel Lincoln 
and Captain Win. B. Bacon. 

To this council is given the determination of what articles 
the Sutler shall keep, and the prices he may ask for each. 
While it is not of much consequence at what price he disposes 
of fried pies, dougnuts, apples, cigars, cheese, butter &c. ; for 
these the men may or may not purchase, as they feel inclined, 
it is of importance that advantage shall not be taken of their 
necessities, and that exhorbitant prices shall not be asked for 
oil, emery cloth, blacking, brushes, &c., and the other articles 



40 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

which the men require for the proper care of their arms, 
equipments and clothing. 

25th. Grover, acting Major General, has applied to have us 
attached to his, formerly Hooker s Division, paying us the 
indirect, but high compliment, of offering for us the " Excelsior 
Brigade." Perhaps we are getting a little vain, but the flattering 
comments made by the many officers who visit oar camp, watch 
our drills, and inspect our parades, and the hearty and oft 
repeated applause given by the old soldiers who throng our 
line, excuse, if they do not justify such feelings on our part. 

Especially are we complimented for the beauty, order, and 
cleanliness of our camp, and its surroundings. A critical 
inspection of this is made every morning. Immediately after 
guard mounting the whole surface of the camp, from the guard 
line, past the parade, is swept by the prisoners, or, if there are 
none, by a detail from the regiment, and the rubbish is carted 
to a distance. The refuse of the cook houses, kept for the time 
in tight barrels, is carried away daily, emptied into holes dug 
for the purpose, and carefully covered with fresh earth. 

Genera] Orders " Headquarters defenses of Washington, 
south of the Potomac," just received, prohibit " the sounding 
of reveille before sunrise." Now when is sunrise ? And how 
determined, if like that of to-day, the morning is cloudy? 
Alexandria has been searched in vain for an almanac, and the 
Adjutant and chief Bugler each seem to have an extra wheel, 
to keep in, or take out of their watches, according to the length 
and soundness of their morning naps. 

Dress coats are being issued and the Colonel is having his 
tent floored, and the two things look as if we were settled here. 

Hark ! what a noise ! It seems as if Bedlam had broken 
loose I 

The Corporal of the guard salutes, and reports that his 
senior Lieutenant had sent up a prisoner whom he could do 
nothing with. 

It was Anderson of "B" who, from having been one of the 
very best soldiers of the company, has become utterly indiffer 
ent to, and negligent of duty, and dirty in person and clothing. 
He had thrown away his pants, substituting therefor his blouse, 



FORT LYON AND VICINITY. 41 

into the sleeves of which, he had thrust his legs. The body of 
this garment was indifferently secured around his person, by a 
broad belt of light blue cloth. Pieces of red flannel were 
pinned to his shirt, and on each shoulder, as marks of imaginary 
rank. His countenance was rigid as if cut from marble, and 
his appearance drew roars of laughter from the boys, who 
turned out to look at him, and perhaps to notice his reception. 

"Ah! Anderson is this you? What dress is that? " " An 
uniform of my own, Colonel !" " Your own, is it? Well, Mr. 
officer, enter upon the guard book that it is not to be changed 
in any particular, except by express orders from these Head 
quarters." "But Colonel, I am sick!" "Sick, are you? Well! 
orderly, give Dr. Clark my compliments and ask him to report 
here at once ! The Doctor could detect no evidence of 
sickness, but, as the result of a consultation, adminstered a 
powerful emetico-cathartic. It was swallowed, but with a wry 
face, and the poor fellow has been kept occupied in more ways 
than one ever since. 

27th. Anderson reports himself as better this morning, 
indeed, as feeling quite well; so he is at work, under guard, 
picking up the thousand and one little pieces of paper lying 
about camp. The wind is blowing raw and cold, and his new 
pattern of pants leaves uncovered a most substantial part of 
his body. He has preferred a request to be allowed to 
exchange his own for our uniform ; but we are not issuing 
clothing, just now. 

29th. We are transferred from Grover s command, and 
ordered to report to General R. O. Tyler, of the 1st Connec 
ticut Heavy Artillery. This, much to the disgust of most of 
the officers, though the Colonel says, "this is just what I have 
been working for." Captain Chandler, promoted from a 1st 
Lieutenancy in the 1st Massachusetts Infantry, to the command 
of " F " of ours, reported to-day for duty. 

Regimental General Order directs that the guard be in 
structed daily, by relief, in the proper discharge of their duty; 
the Lieutenant Colonel personally to superintend the instruc 
tions, at least once daily. This officer is also notified by the 
same order that he will be held personally responsible for the 



42 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

manner in which this duty is hereafter done. The order was 
issued in consequence of the following: The Surgeon had 
occasion, some little time ago, to visit the Hospital after dark, 
the Hospital itself being outside of the camp limits. As he 
approached the lines, he was challenged by the sentinel (a man 
of "A"), who, as he brought his musket to the charge, 
scratched with his bayonet the Doctor s breast. " I don t know 
anything about military duty," said the Surgeon, when repre 
senting the matter, " but I do know that I don t want to be run 
through. If that is the proper way to challenge a man, all 
right ; only just tell me how to avoid being stuck in a dark 
night ; if it is not the proper way, just alter it ; either way I 
am satisfied. The Doctor is assured he shan t be run through, 
and to secure that end, this order is issued. As guard duty 
has been done by Company, it was easy to place the responsi 
bility in this case, and Company "A," principally complained of, 
will change its practice. 

We still picket our front, the line being some four miles out. 
One post is upon the estate of Mason, of Mason and Slidell 
notoriety; a princely place, so our officers say, confiscated by 
our government, and held in joint occupancy by a Colonel 
Dulaney, a sort of deputy, under " Pierrepont," governor of 
West Virginia, and seven Secesh women, all of these being 
wives or widows of Rebel officers. 

The Colonel, accompanied by two officers of Hooker s Staff, 
and a young lad} 7 from Boston, over whom we are all raving, 
returned from Washington, where he has been for the last day 
or two. During his absence, some of the officers of the 33d, 
with their band, came up to serenade Headquarters. It was 
considered a sure thing that they would be dry after their long 
and dusty walk, but the united Field and Staff could not furnish 
enough to even wet their lips. So, by way of excuse, we told 
them that they couldn t wonder that our supply was short, 
knowing, as they did, that we could procure nothing but what 
they allowed to pass their lines, and none knew better than 
themselves how little that was. 

30^A. Monthly inspection to-day showed a very marked 
improvement in the appearance of the men, and the condition 
of their arms and equipments, 



FORT LYON AND VICINITY. 43 

Oct. 2d. Eight batteries and seven regiments of Infantry, 
with a long train of ambulances, have passed by camp on 
their way to participate in a review by Major General Sickles 
of his (Hooker s old) division. As the men of the 1st Massa 
chusetts and the 26th Pennsylvania were marching by our drill 
ground, where we were hard at it, they recognized our Colonel, 
who, for a time on the Peninsula, had commanded each of 
these bodies, and their loud shouts of " therms old double 
quick ! " drew from him responsive salute, and from us, cheers. 

3d. Orders just received direct the breaking up of camp. 
Many are the speculations as to the reason, but really it is a 
sanitary measure only ; it being thought advisable that ground 
so long covered with canvass should have the benefit of sun 
light, and thorough airing. In spite of all our care, some queer 
revelations mere made by this striking of tents ; not the least 
astonishing being the amount of medicine which has been 
concealed. One tent disclosed nearly a quart of .pills, pre 
scribed and given out at Surgeon s call, but not taken. The 
surgeons look aghast, but it must be confessed the rest of us 
enjoy the joke. Yesterday a man of F, carelessly fired his 
piece and lost two fingers of his right hand in consequence. 
To-day one of B s men discharged his musket in attempting 
to draw the load. The ball passed through the palm of his 
hand, but without injuring any bone. 

General Banks honored us with a visit. He desires to have 
us as a part of an expeditionary corps now being organized by 
him, and is assured such service would be very gratifying to 
the regiment. 

8th. Company E, Lieutenant Macomber in command, on 
picket in our front, has sent in a request to be allowed to 
remain out another day, having discovered traces of the 
passage through our lines of a rebel spy whom they hope to 
capture. The request is granted. 

Our Quartermaster is down with typhoid fever, which 
prevails among us to a good extent, but luckily of a mild form. 
He has been moved to the house of a Mr. Roberts near by, 
where he will be tenderly cared for. The measles have broken 
out among the men, and for the present we shall be tabooed in 



44 THLKTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

consequence. Reports from company commanders show that 
we have over three hundred men who have never had this 
disease. Captain Fox, who has been sick for near six weeks, 
reported for duty to-day. Captain H. is on the morning sick 
list, but S., his 1st Lieutenant, says he is down only from too 
much Battalion drill. 

10th. Company E is still on picket. Its term of duty 
expired a day or two ago. The spy whose traces were 
discovered, and to capture whom its commander desired to be 
allowed to remain, failed to put in an appearance as expected. 
The Lieutenant now reports the discovery in the brush near his 
line, of fresh horse dung, and thinking that he has both a sure 
and a soft thing in hand, asks to be allowed to remain another 
twenty-four hours, that his company may have the eclat of the 
capture. Of course his request is granted, and the rest of us 
are now anticipating much sport at his expense. 

1 2th. Lieutenant E., of F is detailed as Acting Regimental 
Quartermaster, during the absence of Howland, who goes home 
to-day on sick leave. 

A heavy rain, which, commencing yesterday, has continued 
since with undiminished violence, has transformed our camp 
into a mortar bed, and we wish we were anywhere but on the 
north-east side of a steep clay hill, in open tents, without floors, 
and the wind blowing, one moment a hurricane from the north 
east, and the next great guns from the north-west. The Colonel 
goes to Washington to-night, having been called there by 
Governor Andrew. All hands are making every possible effort, 
to guard against this terrible weather, and officers servants are 
scouring the country for old stoves, stove pipes, and pieces of 
sheet iron. 

Our teams are employed in drawing into camp, bricks with 
which to build ovens for the companies, and such chimnies 
and walks as are desirable. We gather them wherever they 
can be found. I wonder how each owner is hereafter to 
identify his property ! A walk through the camp discloses 
a great variety of ingenious ways of keeping comfortable. If 
an officer is rich (and whoever has for a servant one of these 
" contrabands " is so,) in the possession of a little box stove, 



FORT LYON AND VICINITY. 45 

with a piece of stove pipe, he rivets together, back to back, 
two tin mess plates, which, inserted in a slit made in the side 
or roof of his tent, makes a primitive thimble for the passage 
of his pipe. This fellow is an aristocrat. If he is poor in this 
sense, and unfortunate in having no stove, he takes an iron 
pot, turns it bottom side up, over a hole in the ground, which 
serves as a fire-place. From this a trench is dug across his 
tent, which is covered with boards, and terminates outside in 
a chimney formed by four or five pork barrels, set one above 
the other. 

Beds vary still more. A. spreads his blankets upon his tent 
floor, of dirt or wood, as the case may be, and uses his boots for 
a pillow ; B. nails up a long narrow box, strongly suggestive 
of that unpleasant, black looking shell, in which we all sleep 
our last slumber ; another makes his couch of small cedar or 
arbor vitse twigs, carefully laid one upon the other; while he 
who is more fastidious, drives, into the ground four forked 
sticks, rests upon them two slender poles, to which a proper 
number of barrel staves are fastened cross ways, and, spreading 
his blankets, enjoys a spring bed, as luxurious as any which 
crowd the warehouses at home. 

Ibth. A telegram from " Headquarters defenses of Wash 
ington " was received last night. It informed us of the 
movement in this direction, of a large body of Rebel Cavalry. 
Our picket line was strengthened by an additional Company, 
and the Regiment slept upon its arms. A few shots were 
exchanged by the pickets, but the night in camp passed 
quietly. Our Sutler furnished much amusement to us all in 
his anxiety to find a place where he would be actually safe in 
person, for he professed indifference as to what became of his 
stores. " What a fool I was, ever to come out, " said he. 
" There was no need of it. I was confortable enough at 
" home, a nice woman for a wife, a good house to live in, all 
" paid for, hot and cold water in every room, and nothing 
" to worry about. If they will only let me alone this time ! 
" Say, tell me, isn t their some place that s safe, that a man 
" can go to ? For God s sake if there is, say so, quick ! " 
And upon a suggestion, he hurried up the hill a s fast as his 
4 



46 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

short legs could carry him, in search of a bomb proof in the 
fort. 

We lost, last night, one of our men by desertion. 

Lieutenant Ripley is laid up with rheumatism, and Lieu 
tenant Goodrich off duty by an accidental injury to his foot. 

Fevers, chills, and new cases of rheumatism exhibit them 
selves daily ; and with the measles, cases of which show 
occasionally, our sick list is becoming fearfully large. The 
Surgeon has just returned from Washington, where he went 
to procure, from the sanitary commission some comforts for the 
sick, not issued by the Government. He is a " queer stick," 
reserved arid taciturn to a fault, but in his intercourse with 
the sick, kind, tender and sympathetic. He and his assistants 
are all splendid fellows, and we are fortunate, indeed, in our 
medical staff. 

In addition to these officers our hospital corps is composed of 
a steward and assistant steward, five nurses, two cooks and 
one man who does the washing. 

16/i. " Only think, Colonel," said Lieutenant E. to.day, 
"only two years and nine months longer to serve!" The 
ludicrous aspect of the matter so stated, caused a shout of 
laughter from all who heard him. 

O 

The column of Rebel Cavalry which was cause of alarm 
to us a night or two ago, is reported to have been yesterday 
within a few miles of Chain Bridge, and their presence has put 
the whole line from Harper s Ferry to this place on the 
qui vive. 

In exchange for the two four-horse teams, taken from us 
a few days ago by officers of the Quartermaster s department, 
we now have the offer of two six mule teams. As the mules 
are unbroken, we decline the offer. Other regiments near us 
have made such exchange, and a funny time they are having 
in breaking these animals to harness. One man is at the head 
of each leader, another is on the near wheeler, while still 
another acts as a skirmisher. The mules go along, braying and 
kicking as if possessed by a thousand devils. Now the} 7 go 
plunging into a ravine, and over goes the wagon ; this righted, 
they bound up a steep bank, and another overturn is occa- 



FORT LYON AND VICINITY. 47 

sioned; once more in order, crack go the whips, and with 
mingled yells from the driver and braying of the mules, a 
narrow causeway is approached. " Hi ! hi there," shouts the 
manager to the driver of an ambulance, whose team is slowly 
plodding along ahead. " Hi, there ! get out of the way !" 
"Get out of the way yourself," comes answering back. " All 
right," shouts the muleteer, "your team goes where you drive." 
"J ride where my mules take me; if you don t care, I don t." 
A collision seems unavoidable. The party of the ambulance 
looks anxious; the mule rider triumphant; when, just as a 
crash seems inevitable, swoop go the mules from the cause 
way, over goes the wagon, and all are neck deep in the water. 
The laugh is with the ambulance party, now. Hours pass 
away sometimes before the mules can be made to move ; and 
we turn congratulating ourselves that we are not yet serving 
Uncle Samuel as mule drivers. 

21. Our drill this afternoon was honored by the presence 
of a large number of officers, from Brigadiers to Lieutenants, 
who rode out from Alexandria to witness it. The boys did 
admirably, and won much well deserved applause. 

22d. Precisely how he brought it about is not clear ; but 
E., our Acting Quartermaster has returned from Washington, 
bringing with him a complete set of armorer s tools, which are 
denied to all regiments furnished, as we are, with Springfield 
muskets. Of course this possession of tools necessitates the 
detail of some one as armorer, which is done. A General 
Order of the day constitutes the Lieutenant Colonel, Regi 
mental Trial Officer, to try and determine all cases such as 
have formerly been sent to Regimental Court Martial which 
last named are abolished from this date. 

Another case of measles showed to-day, although sixteen 
days have passed since the last one appeared. This will fasten 
us here, undoubtedly, for a long while, as however anxious 
officers may be to strengthen their commands with new regi 
ments, none of them fancy new diseases. 

Another of our boys, Perry of C, died to-day. He was 
taken down, seven weeks since, with typhoid fever, from 



48 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

which he was slowly recovering, when he was attacked with 
the measles. 

23c?. Well ! we are tired enough to-night. On the 21st we 
received a dispatch from General Sickles, who has Hooker s old 
division, advising us that General Banks, who commands the 
defences of Washington, accompanied by the President and 
Secretary of State, would review his troops ; inviting us to join 
his command for the occasion, and tendering us the honor of 
acting as immediate escort to the reviewing party. Our 
Column, in platoon front, covered the street from curb to curb, 
and our marching and appearance drew oft-repeated cheers 
from the many soldiers and civilians who thronged the side 
walk. Surrendering the Reviewing party, we took the place 
assigned us in line. The Drums rolled, the Bands played and 
arms were presented to the General-in-Chief. Galloping to the 
right the Reviewing party rode slowly along the front, every 
Regiment save one, at the approach of the dignitaries coming to 
the Present, and so remaining till the reviewing party had 
passed. The 34th alone, stood at the " shoulder." After 
marching in review in column of companies, the troops were 
dismissed. Colonel Wells, who during the day had been on 
duty with the General Staff, made to us, on the field, a little 
speech, saying that "he felt grateful to us, thankful for us, and 
proud of us, and that among the many regiments he had seen, 
he had never seen one which, on such an occasion, appeared 
better." 

^Ath. The order at " Parade " to-night was varied by the 
reading of the following from General Sickles : 

"The Major General commanding, besides the President and 
" Major General Banks, takes great pleasure in complimenting 
"the soldiers of his division, for their appearance, their skill in 
" marching, and efficiency in the manual of arms ; and particu- 
"larly to the 34th Massachusetts Regiment, who performed 
" escort duty for the President, he expresses his highest appre- 
" ciation. Never before has he "seen a new regiment that 
" appeared so well ; their marching, the oldest regiment being 
" unable to excel," 



FORT LYON AND VICINITY. 49 

25th to 21th. Regimental General Order published to-day, 
announces the promotion of Captain H. W. Pratt, of Company 
A, to be Major ; 1st Lieutenant F. T. Leach to be Captain : 2d 
Lieutenant Wm. L. Cobb to be 1st Lieutenant; and Sergeant 
H. T. Hall, to be 2d Lieutenant. The 1st District of Columbia, 
and the 153d New York, are encamped in our front, and our 
surrounding is again looking warlike. We are having the most 
terrible storm yet experienced. The rain is now, and has been 
for the past twenty-four hours, coining down like a deluge, and 
the wind blowing a perfect hurricane. 



CHAPTER IV. 



RECRUITING. INSPECTION. ELECTION. A CONSCIENTIOUS 
FEEDER. HOSPITAL. 

30A. Our sick list is becoming fearful; there being over 
two hundred and twenty in hospital and in quarters. By 
death, desertion, and discharge, we are reduced to the round 
one thousand. Lieutenant J. W. Smith has this afternoon 
welcomed to camp his wife, and has sent up a request to be 
allowed to take temporary quarters outside our lines. A little 
irregular this, but what less could be asked, or granted ? 

"Hark! What s that noise? Do you hear it? What a 
squalling ! " " Pshaw ! that s absurd ! It sold P singing corona 
tion." " Well, let s find out about it. Good morning Captain P, 
So you re recruiting, are you?" " Recruiting, sir ! recruiting! 
Company C isn t doing anything of the kind ! " " But Captain, 
your company has got a new member in camp." "A new 
member in my company, and I not know it ! How s that ? 
when sir? where sir?" "In your company cook house, 
now Captain." "Who? what? I don t understand sir." U A 
Baby ! Captain ! a Baby ! " " A baby, sir ! a baby in my 
company without my order! Lieutenant, what does this 
mean? Find out sir, and report sir, at once." With a bound 
the Lieutenant is at the cook house, and as he opens the door, 
y-a-h, y a a a h goes the baby. The captain stood 
straighter than ever, and looked aghast at the confirmation of 
the charge. The matter is easily explained. The man s wife 
has come out to be near her husband, and walks daily to and 
from Alexandria to pass the time with him when not on duty. 

Such devotion deserves reward, and orders are issued to 
pitch a tent just outside the lines for her use. 

To-day is the last of the month. In the absence of 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 51 

the Colonel, who is sick, the regiment was reviewed, inspected, 
and mustered for pay by the Lieutenant Colonel. This inspec 
tion and mustering for pay is no child s work either, and this, 
whether one looks at it from the standpoint of an inspecting 
officer, or the inspected men. 

To take into ones hands, and examine critically one thousand 
stand of arms ; to inspect closely the appearance and condition 
of the men, their clothing and equipments, and the manner 
in which the same are put on and worn, or rather, are packed 
in the knapsacks ; inspect the ammunition, its quantity and 
quality ; to verify each company roll and see that each man, 
whether present or absent, is accounted for ; to examine the 
condition of the camp, the quarters of the men, the company 
books, and manner of keeping, &c., &c., is no light task. Nor 
is it an easy thing for the men, drawn up in line, to stand 
motionless, head and eyes to the front, disregarding everything 
but each man his own soldierly position. In the heat of the 
day, with a fly marching his beat from the tip of a man s nose 
to his cheek, there is a terrible temptation to brush him away. 

The least movement of a white glove along that line of dark 
blue, is plainly seen, and woe to the unlucky fellow who 
yields to temptation ! He won t want for time to meditate, 
under the shelter of the guard tent, on the uncertainty of the 
things of this life, and the unreasonableness of all human 
enactments. If, after all was done, there was any prospect that 
the pay master would appear, men and officers would be better 
pleased. 

Nov. ls. The Quartermaster reported for duty to-day, just 
in season to allow Lieutenant E to take his company on drill, 
as Captain Chandler has given up sick. Doctor Smith is 
confined to his bed, and Dr. Clark is quite unwell. Our 
sick list numbers to-day two hundred and eighteen. Two of 
G s men died to-day. Our disease is mainly of a typhoid 
nature. 

A strange note has just been handed in to Head Quarters, 
written by a Mr. Mason, whose house is near by, and who is a 
brother to him of Slidell notoriety. The writer states " that he 
"is poor, and his family sick; that he has hitherto been 



52 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" furnished with a guard to protect his person from insult, and 
" his property from injury ; and that by the marching away of 
" old troops, from his immediate neighborhood to-day, he is left 
" exposed." Wherefore, " he requests the commanding officer 
u of the 34th Massachusetts Regiment, this being the command 
u nearest to him, to furnish him with such a guard as shall 
" ensure his protection ; " and concludes with the still more 
cool request, " that the guard shall bring his own rations." 

A plain refusal was returned, but General Patterson, in 
command, who was appealed to, has sent down an order 
directing us to comply with the request, and there is no help. 

Our own position continues unaltered, although there is 
great change among the troops stationed near us. The 15th 
Virginia is now marching on to ground just vacated by Sickles 
division. The 33d Massachusetts has gone to join Sigel, and 
the 123d New York have marching orders. 

The 12th and 13th Vermont moved a night or two ago, and 
the 14th, 15th, and 16th regiments, from the same State, are 
now marching past us to the front. 

The Colonel, who has been in Washington for the past few 
days, returned to-day. 

Candles, hard-tack, and salt horse, as the boys call it, which 
were shipped to the Peninsula for the use of McLellan s army, 
are now being issued to us ; neither seem to have received any 
benefit from the journey. 

4th. Yesterday, battalion drill was dispensed with, and the 
boys enjoyed a good game of foot-ball ; wing playing against 
wing. To-day is Election day, and we are to vote for Governor 
as if at home. The camp has been very quiet; no speeches 
have been made, except one by the chaplain, who mounted a 
pork barrel and harangued in favor of the re-election of 
Governor Andrew. The vote was light, standing 145 for 
Andrew, 345 for Devens, and 5 for Wells. 

Our requisition for lumber has been returned, ^-approved, 
and we send out a strong foraging party, daily. It is now 
returning with a lot of logs, etc., for our stables, which were 
got by pulling down some out-buildings found unoccupied. 

Our equipage is to be reduced seriously by General Orders 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 53 

received to-day. Three wall tents only are allowed the Field 
and Staff officers, instead of the thirteen under which we are 
now sheltered. Each Company is to be allowed two Wall 
instead of the five Sibley tents they now have ; and the Line 
officers are put each to his own " tent cFabri." 

The regiment has attained a good degree of proficiency in 
the movements laid down in the School of the Battalion, and 
the Colonel, who watches from the shadow of his tent its 
progress, expresses entire confidence in the result of a competi 
tive drill with any regiment in the service, whether new or old. 

Warriner of A, a student at law, in the office of Mr. Gillett, 
of Westfield, at the time of his enlistment, died to-day. 

Lieutenant Lovell and Orderly Stiles, of "A," are on the 
sick list to-day, and Fairbanks, of H, died this morning. 
Finn of A, who left the ranks at Norwich, on our way out, 
and Grady of H, are both sent to general Court Martial for 
trial. 

Winter is upon us, but we are illy prepared to meet it. 
Desirous of flooring our tents, we make a requisition for 
lumber, which is returned, refused, " because the 34th is not 
in garrison." Another one for straw is refused, " because the 
34th is not on the march ; " and so red tape bids fair to kill 
both soldiers and horses. 

At Surgeon s call this morning it almost seemed as if a 
majority of the regiment put in an appearance. Men with 
heart disease, with hernia, with diarrhoea, with measles, with 
rheumatism, with backaches, headaches, and aches all over ; 
all obstinately refusing to get better or worse. Take the case 
of one. He has been "sick in quarters" nearly all the time 
we have been out ; never sick enough for the hospital proper. 
He is in "pain all over ;" the Surgeons can discover no actual 
disease, but tender hearted as they are, they regularly, each 
morning, excuse him from all duty. But see what a conscien 
tious feeder he is. His chief of section watched him closely 
this morning. He had before him at breakfast his regular 
ration, which he attacked vigorously, and conquered admirably. 
This was at 7 A. M. ; at 9 he visited the sutler s and made 
way with a loaf of bread, a large piece of fried salt pork, three 
5 



54 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

sausages, six hard boiled eggs, a large slice of cheese, a fried 
pie, and two tin cups of coffee. At noon he was ready for and 
ate his regular allowance. And he is " sick in quarters," and 
has not done a day s duty for more than two months ! 

Upon the above statement of his tfo s-ability, a special Regi 
mental Order put the man upon a course of battalion drill, 
at 2 P. M., and a liberal allowance of " double quick" promises 
to work a cure ; at least, at roll call this evening, he says he is 
feeling much better, and the wonderful properties of the new 
prescription have been reported to the medical staff for their 
information. 

Qth. About three inches of snow lie upon the ground this 
morning. 

11th. In the absence of Colonel Wells, and Lieutenant 
Colonel Singis, who commands the N. Y. battalion of artillery, 
which forms the inner garrison of the fort, the command of the 
post devolves upon Lieutenant Colonel Lincoln. We are 
having issued to us again hard-tack, which was shipped to 
McClellan s army, at the White House ; nearly all of it mouldy 
or wormy, and the whole worthless. 

Three new cases of measles showed to-day. 

Company A will be on duty to-morrow, without even a 
Sergeant in command. The wives of more of our men are 
appearing, prepared to stay, and some old tents, which we 
have gobbled up, are to be pitched for them. 

13A. Troops, new regiments, mostly nine months men, are 
again moving past us to the front. Grover is ordered to report 
to Banks, and Heintzleman is relieved from command of the 
defenses of Washington. Our nearest neighbors, the New 
Jersey Colonel McAllister marched to-day, and thus we 
are left veterans of the field. The Rebels are retiring behind 
the Rappahannock, as it looks now, and our army is pursuing 
the old, old way, of keeping between them and Washington. 
Why the powers at Washington should persist in adhering 
to this route, seems strange to all whose opinion we hear. All 
officers whom we hear speak of the matter, agree that an 
advance by the James, on the south side of Richmond, will 
have to be made eventually. It is reported to-day in Alex- 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 55 

andria, that at Banks request, we are assigned to him; 
although it is stated with equal confidence in Washington, 
that we are to report at Harper s Ferry to Grover. 

So far as depends upon ourselves, we are getting into 
condition for winter. 

The private horses of the command, are now housed in 
comfortable log stables, and the like are being put up for 
the animals belonging to the government. Sixty men are 
detached daily as " choppers." They are making sad havoc 
with a beautiful grove of oak and hickory trees, of about one 
hundred and sixty acres, from which we procure fuel for our 
fires, and stockading for our tents. 

We have been remodelling our hospital. Heretofore it has 
been composed of one Sibley tent for convalescent and special 
patients, another for cook-house and wash-room, two others 
united, one used as dispensary, the other for quarters for the 
steward, and three "hospital tents " ranged in line&gt; each capable 
of accommodating ten patients. It has been impossible to keep 
these tents comfortable, with Sibley stoves, the only means 
provided for heating them. One would almost roast at the 
end near the stoves, while he would be near freezing at the 
other extremity of the tents. To remedy this and other 
troubles, we have had dug at the northern end of this range 
of tents a wide and deep pit, which, covered over with iron and 
earth, constitutes the fire box, and is large enough to receive 
a half cord of wood at a firing. From the rear of this pit, 
or fire box, a trench about two feet square, dug in the center, 
extends the whole length of the range of tents, and enters a 
chimney built of sods and brick, about thirty feet high, at the 
south end of the hospital. This trench is covered with plates 
of iron beaten from old locomotive boilers, which the Rebels 
have wrecked in their various raids upon the railroad, and 
these iron plates are in turn covered with boards in the walks 
between the ranges of cots. 

Ventilation is secured by ripping short spaces in the seams 
of the canvass roof, which are kept open by cross sticks of 
wood. The storm is effectually kept out by a " Fly," which 
covers all. It was fired up yesterday, and proved to be a 



56 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

complete success. Cold as the weather was last night, the 
thermometer showed but three degrees difference at the two 
ends of the tents. In consequence we feel indisposed to part 
with our sick, whom thus far, unlike any Regiment near, we 
have managed to keep with us, in spite of warnings from 
Medical Inspectors, and circulars and orders from Medical 
Directors at division Headquarters. A party of medical officers 
from department Headquarters, some of whom were Regulars, 
have spent hours to-day in examining the hospital. They came 
down to supervise in person the removal of our sick to general 
hospital. A removal which they had more than once directed, 
but which we had never made. After a close examination of 
our arrangements they left us undisturbed ; not only so, but 
gave us many compliments for the ingenuity shown, and the 
care and skill exercised by us. 

Our Vermont friends encamped near by, scrutinize closely 
these and the various other little arrangements we have made 
for our comfort. " Give me the Massachusetts boys," said one 
to his companion, as the two strolled through our camp to-day, 
" for getting fixed up comfortably. By gorry, Jim ; look there ! 
See, they ve got a regular old fashioned well sweep. Don t 
that look like home ? " One of our boys was brought into 
camp this afternoon, wounded in the arm by a charge of ball 
and buck shot, received while plundering a neighboring turnip 
field. In retaliation, some of his company made am excursion 
without leave, and meeted to the owner of the vegetables their 
measure of justice. Upon complaint made by the plundered 
party, Headquarters has taken a hand in the affair, and as a 
result we have a large family in the guard tent. 

Lieutenant Lovell was taken down to-day with fever. 



CHAPTER V. 



A SKIRMISH DRILL. EVENING IN CAMP. VERY HARD LABOR. 

WINTER QUARTERS. AN ARREST. A GOOD JOKE. 

HEAD-QUARTERS DINNER. OUR BAND. 

15th. For some time past the lion commissioned officers 
have been drilled, by themselves, in the movements of the 
skirmish line the commissioned officers having been required 
to be present, although not to participate in the drill itself. Of 
late the drill has been directed by bugle call ; the officers being 
required, if necessary, to supplement the call by verbal order. 
But this morning the entire regiment had its first lesson in 
these movements. The color-guard, strengthened by details 
from each company, formed the reserve. The regiment was 
deployed in line, and, as extended, covered nearly a mile of 
ground. Ail things being arranged, at an intimation from the 
Colonel, the chief bugler sounded " the forward." Our advance 
" is stopped, as we catch the warning call to " lie down ;" and 
" this is sounded at Headquarters, with no regard to the con- 
" dition of the ground on which our temporary beds are to be 
" made. While lying, many of us in uncomfortable positions, 
" we get the order to commence firing, and, as we use nothing 
" but caps, there is no damage done. The order to "rise up" is 
" soon sounded, and, in fear of an imaginary enemy, we get a 
" new one to " rally by fours ; " then " by sections." The alarm 
" is found not to be serious, and again we go forward, deploy- 
"ing as we advance. The bugle almost talks to us. Up and 
" down steep inclines across ravines and morasses, through 
" thickets almost impenetrable, we move in obedience to that 
" imperative note which seems to say " nine miles farther," " nine 
"miles farther," as plainly as if it spoke. Sweating, puffing, 



58 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INPANTKY. 

"and a little tired with this onward rush, we welcome the 
" new notes sounding " the retreat," plainly telling us to " get 
" out of that ! " "get out of that ! " The call to disperse, liber- 
" ally interpreted, sounds like " spread out a little." That to 
"rally, "hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, boys." Associating 
"familiar phrases, like the above with the calls, they become 
" strongly impressed upon the memory." We were out some 
two hours and a half, and for a first performance, the drill was 
a great success. 

16th. We inaugurated, yesterday, a new morning drill, and 
henceforth two Companies are to go to the fort for instruction 
in the school of Artillery, with both Field, arid Siege guns. 
General Barnard, Chief of Artillery, visited our camp to day, 
and inspected the post, and garrison. He says that we are riot 
to be ordered away. 

A Pedler, who supplies us with the daily papers, gave 
us much amusement for a few moments, to-day. " Here I am 
again, boys," he shouted, as he rode his diminutive little mule 
into camp. " Here I am again, with that double-breasted news- 
" paper, the Philadelphia Enquirer. I ve got news for you, 
u glorious news, this time. We ve got the rebels now ! no 
" mistake about it ! ! What s that, Corporal ? Tell you the 
" news ? Well, you buy my papers first ! buy a paper, and I ll 
" tell you a piece of news that is not printed yet ! genuine ! 
" glorious ! no mistake about it ! ! Thank you, Corporal ! 
" thank you ! there s your paper, and here s your change ! And 
"now for the news! McClellan has been heard from! Yes, 
" sir, " little Mac " has been heard from ! He has reported for 
" duty, to his wife ! ! " and putting spurs to his mule, he 
trotted away, shouting " here s the great double-breasted news 
paper ! Great news ! glorious news ! " 

The inimitable manner, in which the story was told to the 
gaping crowd around him, was too much for the gravity of any 
of his hearers, and the camp echoed and re-echoed to the roars 
of laughter which continued long after he rode off. 

27th and %$th. For days past long trains of army wagons 
arid pontoons have occupied our drill ground, en route from 
Washington to Fredericksburg. The roads are well nigh 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 59 

impassable by reason of deep mud. Two squadrons of the 1st 
Massachusetts, one of the 1st Maine, with three regiments of 
Vermont (9 months), men have passed us to-day on their way to 
Sigel; and the 1st Massachusetts battery and 26th Pennsylvania 
are now passing to the same destination. An enormous train 
of Ambulances, under protection of an entire regiment of 
cavalry, has also passed on the Mt. Vernon road, to the front. 
Yesterday was Thanksgiving Day at home, and was in a man 
ner observed by us. All duty, save dress parade, which was 
had at 10 A. M., was suspended. By contribution of the 
officers, a generous supply of oysters was furnished the men 
for dinner. All the officers, save the Colonel, who had 
accepted an invitation to dine with General Heintzleman, in 
Washington, enjoyed a dinner nicely cooked by our good 
friend, Mrs. Roberts, near by. All our teams were sent up to 
Washington, early in the morning, to bring down any boxes 
which might have reached that city by express, for any of the 
regiment. 

Look over the camp with me and notice how the men spend 
their evening hours. Here can be seen a bright eyed, flaxen 
haired young man, whose education at home this call to arms 
has interrupted, pursuing by the* dim light of the regulation 
candle the study of his favorite Latin author while, some few 
tents removed, by the glimmer of a like dip, a group of more 
thoughtless comrades are deep in .the mysteries of old sledge 
or euchre. Withdrawn to a remote corner of the camp, a party 
of earnest and devoted ones join in devout supplication for 
grace and support in the trying scenes which may lie before 
them, while others, more self-reliant, indulge in comments upon 
the latest movements of the army, or growl about the order just 
issued from Regimental Headquarters. The smothered voice 
of some home-sick volunteer, asking in broken notes " Do they 
miss me at home," is fairly drowned by the thundering chorus 
of a party of rollicking ones who leave " John Brown s body 
mouldering in the grave, as they go marching on." 

Such are the scenes of our every day life. 

But when, as to-night, school don t keep, the officers come 
in for their share of the fun. Here the scraping of the fiddle 



60 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

gives warning that Captain F. has a dancing party to-night, 
where booted feet will shuffle in the rapid whirl of a gander 
waltz or quadrille; there, a little way removed, the sonorous 
voice of old P. is heard as he pitches the key note to Coronation 
for his assembled friends. Old Tom is heard counting fifteen- 
two, in the game to which he has challenged his bosom friend 
Charley, and Captain W. is offering to go one better with H., 
who is positive himself, and is trying to satisfy others that he 
knows his little biz? As befits their dignity, the Adjutant and 
Assistant Surgeons, higher up the hill, are warbling strains from 
the last opera, while high over all the loud cry, " Corporal of 
the Guard, post thirteen, " leads to a wondering enquiry from 
all, what the Lieutenant Colonel is up to now. In the momen 
tary lull caused by this last disturbing cry, comes from the tent 
of the " old he Doctor," the cheering direction to " continue the 
same." And so go the hours till taps strike. Then, as by 
magic, all noises cease; all occupations are suspended; all 
lights are put out, and silence settles upon the camp, broken 
only by the monotonous tramp of the sentinel who wearily 
paces his lonely beat. 

There has been an accession to our garrison in the person of 
an Austrian nobleman, Count Engleheim ; sent by General 
Court martial to serve out a sentence of three months to hard 
labor. An officer in the Austrian service, when the news of 
this Rebellion reached him,he obtained leave of absence from 
his command, and reaching here, tendered his services to our 
government. A position on the Staff of General Blenker was 
given him. When Blenker s command was disbanded, this 
young officer, acting by the advice of General Stienwhar, 
enlisted in a new organization then being formed, and was soon 
after commissioned and assigned to staff duty. As Sigel s 
command was marching through a small village on its route, it 
was fired upon by persons in the houses by the way side, and 
Engleheim, with others of the Staff, was directed to search out 
and arrest the offenders. In one of the houses, a man was 
found with a musket in his hands, the barrel of which was 
warm from its recent discharge. Drawing his sabre, Engleheim 
struck a blow which inflicted a serious, though not mortal 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 61 

wound. For this he was arrested, brought before a court 
martial, found guilty, and sentenced to " three months hard 
labor at the Brooklyn Navy yard. " Sigel approved the 
finding of the court, but directed the sentence to be carried out 
at this Post, the nature of the hard labor to be specified by the 
Commandant. If you visit the garrison the Count receives you 
with a pleasant smile, and draws and presents to you a glass of 
" Lager ; " (every cask of which it has been made his duty to 
draw and distribute,) with the remark in his broken English, 
" Very hard labor! Very hard labor! indeed." He is a very 
pleasant, gentlemanly fellow, a most accomplished officer, and 
skilled swordsman and horseman ; and though cheerful, in 
reality chafes under his enforced absence from the active duties 
of army life. 

30th. The Colonel returned from Washington late last 
night to enjoy his cabin, 12 x 20, made of hewn logs, and fitted 
in all the magnificence of a panel door and side lights of 6 x 8 
glass, which the Pioneer corps put up for his use during his 
absence. The fly of his former tent forms the roof of his new 
house. With the exception of the Colonel, and Quartermaster, 
who is now having a cabin built of logs, the Field and Staff 
will winter under canvass. The men will "stockade" their 
tents, orders for doing which have been issued. This stockad 
ing is done by setting on end, in a shallow trench of the 
circumference of the Sibleys, slabs split from logs, set six feet 
above ground, to the tops of which the walls of the tents are 
securely fastened. These slabs are hewn smooth on the inside, 
the space between filled in with clay, and the whole completed 
by hanging on the side facing the street, upon hinges made 
from old boot legs generally, sometimes upon those made from 
wood, doors made from hard-tack boxes, or lumber, if to be 
procured. 

One of our streets is a sort of 5th avenue : the doors of the 
tents being paneled and grained to imitate black walnut and 
mahogany. These particular ones were a gift from the boys of 
those regiments which have recently moved. But there is 
room for suspicion that we do not hold all our possessions by so 
good a title. 
6 



62 THE THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

In the center of these tents is placed a Sibley stove ; above 
which, and around the stove pipe, the arms stand in racks made 
for the purpose. Two tiers of bunks are run around the wooden 
wall, the lower one made broad enough to form a comfortable 
settee. Knapsacks carefully packed, and blankets closely 
rolled, are at the head of each bunk. If the men are luxurious, 
they collect cedar boughs, which, when carefully spread, form 
quite a soft bed springy and elastic. The boxes, received 
from home, are half buried in the ground, beneath the lower 
tier of bunks, and form cellar and store-house for the good 
things each man possesses. 

Nearly all the residents in our neighborhood are indebted to 
abandoned camps, for most of the comforts they possess. 
Dinah takes away on her head lumber enough to build a 
shanty; while Sambo picks up, and hides, chairs, stools, pails, 
stoves, bedsteads, or what answered for such, and in fact, any, 
and everything, which his observation leads him to hope he can 
sell to the troops who next occupy the ground. Vain delusion ! 
for the boys are quick to detect the ear marks of army 
ingenuity, and are ready to appropriate, without compensa 
tion, whatever of the kind, they find and fancy. 

Among other things which reached camp to-day from home, 
was a large box for EL, holding one hundred turkies, intended 
for Thanksgiving. A goodly sized bottle of whiskey, closely 
stowed inside, formed a new kind of stuffing, for one of the 
turkies. 

Dec. 2d. Our monthly inspection, which has been postponed 
on account of continued rain, was had to-day ; at which we 
welcomed Wells Willard, a former Lieutenant and Acting 
Adjutant of the 21st Massachusetts, now Captain, and assigned 
to Company "A " of ours. How we laugh, as we catch, rolled 
out in the sonorous voice of one of Ts " men, "Attention the 
universe ! By kingdom, right wheel ! Where in h 11, old 
Abe, are you going with your States, now ? "" all in imitation 
of a little incident which happened in one of our late drills. 
Yesterday, we sent our Pioneer corps and wagons, out on a 
foraging expedition, after some evergreen trees, with which to 
screen from observation, our " sinks." They were fast cutting 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 63 

down, and loading some beautiful Pines, from a grove of young 
trees, when the owner, a thorough going union man, as is 
everybody here, when his property is touched, appeared, and 
hailed them with, " What are you doing here ? Who are 
you? What regiment do you belong to?" etc., to which 
Bolio, a ready witted teamster, replied : " The 16th Virginia !" 
I reckoned so ! " said the irate Virginian. " Here have I been 
ever since the breaking out of the war, surrounded by troops 
from all parts of the country, and not a stick of wood have 

I lost, till you d d Virginians camped here. I 11 report 

you for a d d low-down thieving set, as you are ; and 

I 11 see if I can t get you ordered away." 

4th. Queeiiy enough, our neighbors, the 16th Virginia, 
moved to " Upton s Hill " yesterday, and we wonder did the 
affair of kt the pines " have anything to do with this order. 

Our guards arrested to-day some old soldiers, tenants 
of the " Convalescent camp," as it is called, who were caught 
in carrying away part of the abattis, which protects the 
approaches to this fort. In defence, the prisoners state that 
there was but forty cords of wood issued the last week to their 
camp of over 16,000 men ; (our own consumption is from ten 
to fifteen cords weekly) ; that they were nearly freezing ; 
thoroughly chilled through, and that they had no fire with 
which to do their cooking even. Of course, discipline required 
that they should replace the wood they had attempted to 
carry off. But humanity equally demanded that they should 
be discharged, with no more than a reprimand. Their camp, 
which is near by us, is in a shocking condition. No one who 
has not seen it can conceive of its un cleanliness, nor of the 
suffering of the poor fellows. In a warm day thousands of 
them can be seen wandering over the country in search of 
chips and twigs with which to boil their coffee, or heat water 
to wash their shirts in. 

The boys are having a good laugh at the expense of the 
Lieutenant Colonel. 

On drill (skirmish) yesterday, some men of F. fell behind 
the line, and were indifferent to the bugle calls, which directed 
the various movements, Their negligence was so marked that 



64 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

the orderly Sergeant was ordered by the Lieutenant Colonel 
in command, to send to the guard tent at the close of the 
drill, one whose name was given, and another described as 
wearing a ragged blouse, particularly torn and out at the elbows. 
There being but one man of F among the prisoners at the 
guard tent this morning, Sergeant B. was called upon to 
explain. " How happens it, Sergeant, that the order, given 
you yesterday on drill, has not been obeyed ? " "I could 
not pick out the man you wanted Colonel." u Couldn t recognize 
one of your own company? How s that, Sergeant?" " Why 
Colonel, you remember that he was a good distance from us, 
when you gave me the order for his arrest, and, as you only 
designated him, as wearing a ragged blouse, badly out at the 
elbows, and, as most of our men wove just that kind of garment, 
I could not be sure which one of them all you wanted." " Oh, 
very well, Sergeant ! that will do for this time, after this we ll 
find an ear mark you will be sure to recognize. " And so now 
" the Boys " are chuckling not a little. 

1th. Snow, to the depth of over three inches, lies on the 
ground, from the storm of day before yesterday. The ther 
mometer stands at eight degrees and the Potomac is frozen 
over. 

12/i. We are having many visitors to our camp, persons 
unable to get to " the front," partly from the difficulty of 
procuring transportation, more perhaps from the General 
Order, just issued, prohibiting the presence of civilians in the 
lines opposite Fredericksburg. As small compensation for 
their disappointment, we admit them within the fort, and 
order out the boys for drill. 

Of course we invite them to our fare. "Sit down with us to 
table. We can t plead that it s washing day, in excuse for our 
boiled dinner. Let me help you to a slice of this boiled pork ; 
it would be good, if it were better done. You don t like it ? 
Well, try a piece of this tongue. What ! you won t ? Well, 
then, try this turnip ; don t be afraid ! You can t mash it ? 
well ! here s something which is softer. What is it ? Why, it 
looks as if it were cabbage ; as if it might now be thickened 
grease ; I guess it s cabbage soup ! You won t take any ? Well, 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 65 

help yourself to anything you see, which you think you 11 like, 
and don t stand upon ceremony ! There, in front of you, is 

salt ; here are pepper and vinegar, and there cook, bring 

the mustard ! Here is what was hard-tack, when first shipped 
to the Peninsula, take it quick, or it will run away ! and 
here is what the sutler calls butter ! You don t eat, gentlemen ! 
well, then, Orderly, set out the sardines and lemons, for dessert. 
I am sorry you don t like our fare ! it is the best we ve got, 
however. Just now we take what we can get, and are thankful 
we can get anything. 

The work upon the new fortifications, in the throwing up of 
which two hundred of our men have been engaged for weeks, 
is progressing satisfactorily, and shows finely. Redoubt "A v is 
completed, and guns are being placed in position to-day. 
Apropos to this, there is circulating among us a good anecdote 
in connection with this line of forts, which is known as the 
" Defences of Washington." Alluding to those now being 
built, as well as to those long since constructed, some one asked 
General McClellan if they could be of any possible use : " Oh, 
yes ! " responded the General, " of incalculable advantage, in a 
POSSIBLE contingency ! " To illustrate : you might ask of what 
possible use is a man s breast ? but, if a man should happen to 
have a baby, don t you see he might possibly find, use for his 
bosom ? And so of these forts, if the rebels should happen to 
take Alexandria or Washington. 

We lost two men, by death, last night ; making four this 
week. Out of seven students at the Westfield Normal School, 
who enlisted and joined us at Camp Wool, five have died, one 
has been discharged by reason of disability, and the remaining 
one is now in hospital, very sick. With such a result, the 
authorities at home must feel compelled to grant that our exam 
inations were none too rigid. 

16th. We buried to-day the second of two brothers. Four 
days ago he appeared for the first time at Surgeon s call; 
complained only of being chilly, but told the doctor he knew 
he should die, and dead he is. Another of the men confined 
for a long time, and given up by the Surgeons, told them he 
should live, and he is now on duty. 



66 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

We have placed five guns in position in the new "redoubt" 
A, and the platforms for the other six are nearly completed. 
This is to be garrisoned by five Companies, under the Lieuten 
ant Colonel; three Companies under the Major are to hold 
" C, " and two under one of the Captains, are to occupy " B." 

I9th. "F" lost one of its Corporals last night by desertion, 
and in him the regiment lost one of its color bearers. He was 
magnificent in phisique, being tall, burly, broad shouldered, 
looking every inch the soldier. But, being Selectman of his 
town at date of enlistment, and dissatisfied at the slow rate of 
promotion in the regiment, he has gone. We lost to-day 
another of G s men. This Company has now lost by death 
and desertion twelve men. 

Mrs. Judge Russell, escorted by Captain Rice of the 1st 
Massachusetts, rode out this forenoon to witness our skirmish 
drill. In compliment to her, blank cartridges were issued to 
the men, which added much to the interest of the exercise. 
We (that is the officers), who are assessed, and who are also 
to contribute monthly, according to rank, are organizing a 
band. The instruments have been-purchased, and the members 
detailed as musicians. Sibley tents, which we " gobbled," 
have been stockaded and otherwise prepared. As a sanitary 
measure, we hope much from it. 

2~Lst. The troops, comprising the garrison, were paraded for 
review and inspection by Acting Brigadier General Wells 
to-day. Crowds of officers rode out from Alexandria to 
witness the ceremony. 

yith. Christmas, on the whole, passed off well. The Colonel, 
attended by Lieut. Colonel Wetherell, of Governor An 
drew s staff, who had been with us a day or two, left for 
Washington to attend a party at Heintzleman s quarters. All 
drills were suspended by order, and none but necessary duty 
performed. Our officers, in return for many civilities received, 
invited the officers of the Dutch garrison to a collation in our 
camp. Apples, cheese, sandwiches, and lager constituted the 
spread. The ill humor of the men to the Sutler, at one time 
threatened an outbreak, which would have seriously affected 
our fair name, but a determined front on the part of a portion 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 67 

of the officers soon quieted all outward manifestations of ill 
feeling. 

The weather is like summer, and we sit with our tent doors 
open, and without fires. The traveling, however, is horrible. 
By orders just issued we are to complete the fortifications 
upon which a portion of our men have so long been laboring, 
and to-morrow r the whole Regiment are to take up the " shovel 
and the hoe." Not much to their liking. 

One of our men received to-day a box intended for Christ 
mas, so badly packed that its contents made one great mince 
pie. Sugar, cheese, chestnuts, cranberries, pickles, apple sauce, 
plum cake, and roast turkey were all jammed into one general 
hash. To wile away time, which otherwise would hang heavy, 
the boys spend some of their spare hours in hunting and killing 
the rats which swarm in the camp, having their homes in the 
holes they have dug in the banks of the ravines adjacent. 
One row of twenty dead ones lies on our right flank ; victims 
of this forenoon s sport. 

Our darkies furnish us with a good deal of amusement. 
From what distinguished families they come ! "Jeff Davis " is 
called to brush the Captain s (Bacon s) boots ; " Zollicoffer " to 
bring an armful of wood; " Beauregard " to draw a pail of 
water. But they devote every spare moment at their command 
in learning to read : all of ours going nightly to a school kept 
at Fairfax Seminary for the especial benefit of their race. 
They all have a "misery at the heart" whenever sickness of an} r 
kind attacks them. The remedy is as unvarying as the com 
plaint is universal, and consists in wrapping head, body and 
feet in as many blankets as they can procure, and sweating and 
sleeping away the ill feeling. 

%8th. Garrison review to-day was a great success, our band 
making its first appearance. To-night the boys are sleeping on 
their arms; one company of the Artillery Battalion garrisons 
" Redoubt " A : " F of ours, Captain Chandler, holds u B : " 
an armed sentinel walks his beat in each street of our camp. 
Mr. Mason, our old acquaintance from Occoquan, broke in 
upon us this afternoon with the statement that, while at his 
dinner, a party representing themselves to be of the 17th 



68 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Pennsylvania cavalry rode up to his house, having been driven 
from their post by a force of rebel cavalry and artillery ; and 
that as he was hurrying to bring us the information, another 
portion of the same command, some of them wounded, rode up 
reporting that the whole line had been driven in. While 
listening to his story, an orderly galloped into camp, bringing 
the compliments of Colonel Zagony, and the information that 
his line (Infantry) had been driven in. We have sent out 
advance posts, and are waiting. Now, at 11 P. M., a party of 
telegraph operators are seeking the shelter and protection of 
our camp. From them we learn that the 17th Pennsylvania is 
badly cut up ; and that the rebel force is at " Pohick church," 
about 8 miles away. 

29^. Peace reigns in our camp, and to all appearance 
"quiet on the Potomac." Alexandria had a big scare last 
night. The post commissary started off all his beef cattle for 
Washington, and employed his entire force in removing his 
other stores. At midnight, General Slough routed his com 
mand and inarched them out some two miles on picket. 



CHAPTER VI. 



WINE PARTY BRIGADED AT LAST AN ORIGINAL WAY OF 
GIVING ORDERS PAY DAY COMMISSIONS RECEIVED 

- A " FATIGUE " PARTY REVIEW AND 

INSPECTION MORE VISITORS. 

Tarty 1st, 1868. Lieutenant Colonel Singis, of the New York 
Artillery Battalion, sent a very polite invitation to the officers 
of the 34th, to attend a "Rhine Wine" party, to be given by 
himself and his officers, at 11 o clock this forenoon. Cold ham, 
corned beef, pigs feet, bologna sausage, potato salad, Swietzer 
cheese, very good, and Limberger cheese, riot so good to ;m 
uneducated palate, wine and lager formed the entertainment. 
Count Engleheim acted as cup-bearer in accordance with his 
sentence. The conversation was limited, so difficult was it for 
us to understand or make ourselves understood ; but all could 
join in camp songs. Distant firing occasionally broke upon our 
ears, rendering some of us, at least, a little nervous, and the 
party soon broke up. 

8th. This is the tenth day that the entire Regiment has been 
at work upon the new line of fortifications. We have accom 
plished a large amount of work, and the engineer in charge, 
Lieut. Schenck, is profuse in his compliments as to the 
manner in which the work has been done. Company " B " 
has, during all this time been employed in the construction of 
" gabions." But the labor is irksome enough, and it is getting 
to be a little difficult to keep the boys steadily and faithfully 
at it. The habitual shirks are formed into a company by 
themselves, arid a little more particular supervision results 
in a day or two, in their being remanded to their own com 
panies. The few hard cases are treated to a " barrel shirt," 
7 



70 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

and a march backward and forward under special escort, with 
perhaps a night in the guard house, always effects a cure. 

A detail of men from the parole camp, for work on these new 
fortifications has been ordered of late. These old soldiers are 
guarded by a company of the 26th Michigan, in their march 
to and from their own camp. But at the trenches, an over 
powering unwillingness to work seizes every devil of them, and 
down go the tools, and out come the "cards,"" and all go in 
for a little " old sledge." The remonstrances of the officers 
of the guard are of no avail. " Away with yees, away with 
yees ; and shure how can you want a man to work all day, 
just for the trifle he gets to eat, when there s no drink at all, 
at all ! " Gen. Barnard, with a party of engineers, has been 
occupied to-day running the lines for an additional Fort, to be 
connected by covered ways and rifle pits, with the redoubts 
we have been constructing; and Lieutenant Schenck commu 
nicates the not very agreeable information, that the 34th will 
be required to build the new works. Colonel Wells chafes at 
this, and says that if we continue our work as we have begun, 
we shall be converted into a regiment of Engineers. 

To our dismay, the " small pox " has made its appearance 
among our negro servants. A General Order directs that every 
man of the command be at once vaccinated, and that every 
negro servant be removed from the camp. After the lapse of 
four weeks, we have three new cases of measles. 

Lieutenant B, of " B," is in arrest, and charges prefered 
against him. His offence being, that, as officer of the guard, 
he gave passes to two Sergeants of his company to go to 
Alexandria, communicating to them also the countersign for 
the night. 

9th. Colonel Wells, having been summoned by special 
message, has left for Washington. " F s " officers have finished 
their cabin, and give a house warming this evening. Dough 
nuts (two large pans of which grace the table, with large 
reserve in the rear), sage cheese, smoked halibut, etc., form 
the repast. We have had returned an application to be 
furnished with copies of " Artillery Practice," with the dis 
approval of General Barry (chief of that arm), endorsed 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 71 

thereon. Not to be balked, we have purchased them from our 
regimental fund. 

One of our Sergeant s, M. of B., is now being tried by Major 
P., acting as trial officer, for the third time. He was drunk 
and noisy, in the streets of A, while there on a pass a few days 
since, and was arrested by the Provost Guard, and confined in 
what used to be known as the " slave pen. Upon being- 
released, on his return to camp, he w^as arrested by our own 
authority, and charges were preferred against him. Upon 
trial, he was adjudged guilty, and a fine of five dollars imposed. 
The proceedings were disapproved, and the matter returned 
to the Major for reconsideration. This resulted in his being- 
sentenced to pay a fine of seventeen dollars, and now again a 
disapproval of the proceedings follows, arid he is to be tried 
anew. 

An inspection and review is ordered for this afternoon, in 
honor of Hon. Charles R. Train, James G. Grinnell, and 
Charles G. Davis, all of Massachusetts, who are present in 
camp. An order " Headquarters defences of Washington, " 
just received, informs us that the regiment and its camp are 
to be subjected to inspection by an officer of the regulars, on 
the 18th. The condition of the command, and the cleanliness 
of the camp, is best judged by the fact that not the slightest 
preparation is to be made for the ceremony. What a terrible 
change in the weather ! Friday and Saturday were as warm 
as June, but last night the thermometer fell to 18,. and to 
night the weather is still colder. 

We lost another man to-day, this one from K. 
17 th. Agreeably to a notice sent down to us yesterday, we 
were inspected to-day, by an officer of the Regular Army, 
detailed for the purpose. It was uncomfortable enough, the 
thermometer standing at 18. 

Another of K. s men died to-day. 

19th. We are fairly brigaded at last. The 1st and 19th 
Connecticut, 14th and 84th Massachusetts, forming- the new 
command. Our brigadier is Robert O. Tyler, a graduate of 
West Point, formerly Colonel of the Connecticut 1st, and said 
now, to be one of the best artillery officers in the service, 



&lt;2 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

According to Lira, to form a really good regiment, the men 
should be what are called " Dandy soldiers." He calls his men 
the " Dandy regiment ; " and #0, the best of the army. Not 
withstanding which, we arrested to-day one of his men, who 
was hanging round our camp, drunk, and noisy, and returned 
him under guard, with our compliments to his Colonel. 

In the intervals of our drills, we watch the efforts of Lieut. 
Colonel Singis in drilling his men, as Infantry. Marching 
in column of companies to-day, where, of course, the guide, is 
left, somehow, probably by accident, Captain Stultz, who 
commands the right company, and led the column, gave the 
order " Guide right/ At once, the Colonel shouted, " halt ! " 
and thus broke out: "What for, Captain Stultz, you shall 
give the order guide right? You be the first company in the 
in the what you call em yes, that s it, in the column. 
You shall guide left! you shall no guide right! When you 
shall march in review, then you shall guide right ; but, by g d, 
yon shall guide right, not at no other time, except once 
when you are last, and shall be first ; then you shall guide 
right also." 

It was an original way of directing that the guide should be 
right, when the column was marching left in front. 

Elwell, of F., makes us all laugh at a story he tells of one of 
his men. " Lieutenant," said the man, "I thought I d come up 
and have, a little talk with you. The fact is, I ve just had a 
letter from one of my folks, and they want to know when I m 
coming home ; they want to see me proper bad, and I kind o 
hanker after them; and so I thought that I d just tell you, that 
after we are paid off, I guess I ll just go back. "Go back ! 
why ? what do you want to go back for ? " " Well ! the fact 
is. Lieutenant, this is nt just what I thought it was going to be ; 
and so, I guess I ll just leave you, when I get my money." To 
the Lieutenant s suggestions that he had better see the Captain 
about the matter, the poor fellow replied, " that he calculated 
that want of no account. He didn t feel much acquainted with 
the Captain, and guessed he (the Lieutenant) would do just as 
as well. 

A Regimental General Order, of to-day s date, inaugurates a 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 73 

school for the commissioned officers. Hours, from seven to nine 
each evening, from date of order, except Sundays. 

24th. A noisy family of some twenty -five of the boys are in 
the hands of the guard this morning. Offences, drunkenness, 
and running the guard. Soley, Lieutenant of yesterday s guard, 
had a hard time of it; a little rebellion in his family, during the 
night, giving him active employment. He proved to be the 
right man for the time, and the place. The immediate cause of 
the row was the presence of the paymaster ; who, however, 
pays us only to November. Sitting around the table during 
the payment, was the Lieutenant Colonel Commanding, the 
Adjutant, prepared to exchange with the men his check upon a 
bank at home for their money; and the sutler, anxious to receive 
from the paying officer the amount of any little bills he may 
have charged. " Here, I want four dollars from that man ! " 
he exclaimed, as, in answer to the call of his name, the man 
stepped forward. " Sorry for you," was the reply of the pay 
master. " Deducting stoppages, charged against him on the 
roll, there is thirty-six dollars and six cents due : ten dollars 
monthly has been allotted by the man to his wife. You can 
have the six cents, if you are ({uick about it." 

The Colonel has gone to Washington to attend the wedding 
of one of his friends. Commissions were received to-day for 
Soley, Captain, Vice Holden, resigned ; Lincoln to be 1st Lieu 
tenant, Vice Soley, promoted ; and Orderly Sergeant Stiles, of 
A, to be 2d Lieutenant, Vice Lincoln promoted. 

Our drills (during our temporary relief from fatigue duty at 
the redoubts, granted on account of the frozen condition of the 
ground), have been resumed. This afternoon, however, we had 
an interesting little fatigue party of our own, to vary the 
monotony of our life. Outside of our lines, though in front, 
and near to our camp, is a thick growth of brash ; and although 
we have always dug suitable ainks for the command, which 
have been kept clean by daily covering of earth, the boys 
have used this ground till it has become offensive. So, it was 
determined to give such a lesson as would prevent any re 
currence of like trouble. Shovels, in sufficient number to 
properly arm the whole command, were borrowed for the 



74 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

occasion, and thus provided, the men were moved against 
the offensive position. There was an involuntary recoil of 
the line as the work of the afternoon was disclosed, but escape 
was hopeless, and the result is that the ground is thoroughly 
policed. There is general belief that no occasion will arise to 
take the boys out for like duty again.. 

An order from General Tyler, just issued, contains the 
following announcement: u The garrison of Fort Lyon will 
be inspected on Saturday next. An inspecting officer will be 
detailed from these Headquarters. The troops will be allowed 
the whole of the day previous, to get ready." Whew ! I guess 
we shall survive. 

Since we were paid the very devil seems to be to pay. A 
thorough search has been made in all the houses and suspected 
places near us, but to little purpose. We find no rum, and no 
signs that any is kept. Nevertheless, it is all drunk, with some 
woman. We are fairly non-plussed. But an unusual expanse 
of crinoline on the persons of some apparently innocent apple 
women, excited suspicion ; suspicion led to search ; search 
disclosed a string of canteens secured to the waists of the frail 
ones, beneath the exuberance of petticoat and flounce, and 
we breath free once again. 

28^. A violent north-east snow storm broke upon us last 
night, and has continued to rage all day. Our sentries have 
been withdrawn from all posts, save at the guard tent and 
Headquarters, and .these are relieved hourly. Spite of the 
severity of the weather, we are compelled to send out our 
teams, and a small fatigue party, to keep our fires going. In 
the bad state of the roads, our teams (four horse), can bring in 
but about two and one-half feet at a load, and they are kept 
constantly employed in consequence. Three of our horses 
died last night. Lieutenant Lincoln, while following through 
the brush some citizens of Alexandria who were hanging 
around the camp, and supplying our men with whiskey, was 
suddenly seized from behind, overpowered, and deprived of 
his revolver. 

29A. Two ambulances, each drawn by four horses, in which 
were Colonel Wells, Adjutant Woods, Lieutenant Bacon, 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 75 

Captain Potter, and Sergeants Clark and Pomroy of B as 
witnesses, with Lieutenant Butler the accused, have just left- 
camp, for fort Richardson, at which place the Court, before 
which Lieutenant B. is to be tried, convenes today. 

3~Lst. The regiment was reviewed and inspected to-day by- 
Lieutenant Colonel Kellogg of the 19th Connecticut, detailed 
for that purpose, from Brigade Headquarters. 

The day was beautiful over head, but, under foot, perfectly 
horrible. " All very nice for those who ride, but pretty rough 
for us poor devils who foot it," could be heard, in under tone 
along the line. We had donned all our finery for the occasion. 
The boys sported white gloves, purchased from the regimental 
fund, and the officers were in holiday attire. But the muskets 
were bespattered with mud, and the sashes showed a kind of 
ashes of roses color, as the rich underground of scarlet showed 
faintly beneath the thick upper crust of the sacred soil. 
Notwithstanding the intimation contained in the General 
Order directing the inspection, not a minute had been given 
for special preparation. We appeared, as we could appear 
any day, with ten minutes notice. The inspection was very- 
rigid, everything belonging to us being subjected to close 
scrutiny. 

In the absence of General Tyler, we found consolation in 
the presence of Captain Wyman of the 33d, and Hon. J) wight 
Foster and Judge Russell of Massachusetts, and our old friend 
Grinnell from Washington. 

FeVy 1st. " I do not believe, " says Colonel Kellogg in his 
official report of his inspection, made yesterday, " I do not 
" believe that there is another regiment in the whole service, 
" that can show so many guns, in such good condition. My 
" own regiment, which I think a good deal of, is nowhere in 
" comparison, and though I think the 1st Connecticut has two 
" companies that can beat anything I have seen to-day, as a 
" whole, the regiment won t compare with you." We stand an 
inch taller in consequence of this, and all we ask now is for 
an opportunity to drill with this dandy 1st. When the mud 
is dried, and the country more passable, we are to invade the 
quarters of this crack regiment, moving as skirmishers, by bugle 



76 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

call solely: A thing General Tyler says he has never known 
a regiment, as a whole, able to do. 

6th. A severe snow storm from the northeast set in yester 
day, but this morning, the wind changed to the southwest, and 
brought rain instead of snow. A photographer from A. 
visited us to-day, for the purpose of getting a picture of 
our camp. Three views were taken ; one of the camp merely, 
one with the regiment in column of companies closed in mass, 
and another with the regiment in line as for parade. In each 
of the two last the encampment formed the background of the 
picture. By general order, all the troops in and around 
Washington, including those garrisoning Alexandria and the 
neighboring forts, are to compose the " 22d Corps," under Major 
General Heintzelman. 

bth. The thermometer has been, for the past few days at 18; 
our snow changed to rain last night, but the wind has again 
changed, and warm rain is now falling. 

A train of fifteen wagons, procured from the Post Quarter 
master at Alexandria yesterday, was employed with our own 
su , in drawing wood into our camp ; but the whole amount 
drawn, will hardly keep our fires an equal number of hours. 
The Colonel is detailed on a Court of Enquiry, to investigate 
charges preferred by Gen. Slough, against Capt. Wynian of the 
33d, Provost Marshal of Alexandria. 

T. W. Hammond, wife and son, of Worcester, and Mrs. 
Pierrepont, wife of Rev. John, made us a flying visit to-day. 
Mrs. Hammond left a bundle of stockings, to be given to any 
of the boys who were in need. Samuel Smith, city clerk of 
the same city, Hon Mr. Washburn, M. C., and Mr. Purple, both 
from Franklin County, also made us a short visit. 

IQth. The birds are with us ; and those farmers, who think 
that the heavy foot of war is not to be placed again upon their 
fields, are busily engaged in planting and seeding. We have 
procured, by appropriation from the Regimental Fund, boxing 
gloves and foot balls for each company in the regiment ; and 
the camp is noisy with the shouts of the men engaged in those 
games. The band is also playing at Headquarters. 



CHAPTER VII. 



BRIGADE H D-Q RS-GUARD MORE VISITORS SCHOOL 

COURT MARTIAL THE ADj T AN ALARM A CRIPPLE 

BRIGADE LIEUT. LINCOLN S WOOD PARTY A JOKE. 

We are furnishing our quota of men for Brigade Headquar 
ters Guard. One Sergeant and three privates, selected by each 
captain from those of his company most proficient in drill, 
reported to the Lieut. Colonel commanding. From this 
number was selected a Sergeant at large, and one private from 
each company, as our contribution to this body. Yesterday 
morning the General took it into his head to inspect his guard. 
He is reported to have gone down his line, tossing his head, 
and saying to his A. A. General: "A-d-j-u-t-a-n-t, a-h! 
here s a thing- that won t do won t do at all send it back ! 
and, a-h here s another bah ! send them both back and 
get others ! " So this morning, a man of F, and one from G, 
were conducted into camp by a Sergeant, who bore a letter 
from the A. A. A. General, communicating the intelli 
gence that the men " would nt do ; " and directing others 
to be detailed in their stead. The men u that would 1 nt do " 
had been selected for their thorough knowledge of guard 
duty, and proficiency in the manual, as well as for their 
general good character as soldiers. No reason was given for 
their rejection. So, recalling the general s predilection, we 
decided to humor it. He had rejected good soldiers. We 
returned to him swell fellows, who sported white chokers and 
oiled their hair and whiskers ; and, if he is satisfied with the 
exchange, we shall be. 

llth-ZQth. The weather, which yesterday was delightfully 
warm and pleasant, changed during the night, and a storm of 



78 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

snow, followed by rain, lias raged all day. Spite of the severity 
of the weather, troops have been moving in round us. Girney s 
Brigade, from Upton s Hill, has encamped near by, and Cow- 
din s, although not visible to us, is closely adjoining. Among 
our visitors of the last few days, have been Gen. Calvin Pratt, 
Judge Chapin, and Henry C. Rice, of Worcester, and H. B. 
Staples, of Milford. They all walked from the city to camp; 
the last two passing safely over the ground, in which the 
Judge, but a few hours before, had seen his overshoes swallowed. 

Dr. Thorndike has left for home, on leave obtained at the Wai- 
Department, spite of the disapproval of Gen. Heintzelman. 

Lieut. Smith, of D. has sent up again his resignation ; this 
time " immediate, and unconditional/ His former one, although 
approved at Regimental Headquarters, was cfa s-approved by the 
General Commanding the Defences. 

Camp life is just now softened by the presence of the wives of 
Surgeon Clark, Capt s. Pratt and Cooly, and Quartermaster 
Howland. The snow of the past storm, lies some seven or eight 
inches deep, rendering drills impracticable. The officers are 
exercising their ingenuity in constructing all kinds of indescrib 
able things, which answeras poor substitutes for sleighs, and 
" the Boys " are amusing themselves in match games of snow 
balling, where even shoulder straps do not secure exemption 
from, let us be wise and call them stray balls. It is high 
carnival with all, save the occupants of the guard tents, who 
are kept busy shoveling paths across the camp, which, out of 
regard to the crinoline, are dug some seven to eight feet wide. 

Our sick list is complicated with a few cases of scurvy ; and, 
since the government issues no vegetables, the Regimental Fund 
has been drawn upon for the where- withal to purchase a supply 
of onions, for the men, all of which are eaten raw. 

The school for " officers," which has been running now for 
some months, closed its first term last evening. No doubt the 
officers will enjoy their vacation, as much as if they were 
scholars of more tender age. Strange as it may seem, it can t 
be truthfully said, that they hunger and thirst for education s 
sake. No instance has occurred, as yet, of pining because of 
enforced absence from camp, during school hours, nor are they 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 79 

all found listening anxiously for the bugle call which summons 
them to this duty. There are some cases of habitual tardiness, 
and instances of attempts at absenting themselves altogether. 
Apropos to this is the following: "Orderly," said the Colonel, 
a night or two ago, " Orderly, give my compliments to Capt. C. 
and tell him the school is waiting his arrival." And no one 
seemed to envy the .Captain his situation when he put in his 
appearance. " Now, gentlemen," resumed the Colonel, " now 
that we are all together, we ll take up our lesson, which is 
upon fortifications/ " Lieut. S, how would you go to work to 
construct a magazine ?" The answer, satisfactory so far as it 
is given, is interrupted by putting to the next in position the 
question " In what manner should the roof be constructed so 
as to render it bomb proof? This officer hesitates, becomes 
confused, " Next," calls out the Colonel. " 1 pass, sir," is his 
reply, perhaps forgetting that he is not playing euchre. And 
the Colonel turning to hide the smile playing upon his lips, 
says : " Well, Capt. P, how would you go to work ?" " I 
should not take the job, Colonel." And no one more heartily 
than the Colonel joins in the roar which is excited by this 
answer. 

Again, " Capt. C., suppose the regiment is ordered out for 
inspection, where would you place the Commissary Sergeant? " 
"The Commissary Sergeant ?" asked the Captain seeking by 
the question to gain time for thought. " Yes Captain, the 
Commissary Sergeant, what would you do with him ? " "Send 
him to his quarters, Colonel." And again, in the laugh that 
followed, the Colonel s voice drowned all others. 

Lieut. Macomber, who has been confined for the last six 
weeks with a severe attack of inflammatory rheumatism, and 
who had applied for " leave of absence," based upon Surgeon s 
certificate, approved by his commanding officers, had his appli- 
4 cation returned to-day, cfo s-approved, but accompanied with a 
pass admitting him to officers hospital in Georgetown. 

In the matter of Orville Young, tried for striking the Orderly 
Sergeant of his company, the sentence of the Court is : " that 
" he be confined at hard labor at the Rip-raps for three years, 
" without pay, and then be dismissed the service." Farley of 



$0 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

I. tried by the same Court, for desertion, is sentenced "to hard 
" labor, without pay, for the same term, and at the expiration 
u of that time, to be branded on the left shoulder, with the letter 
" D." The sentence of Lieut. Butler is not as yet promulgated. 

%8th. To-day is bi-monthly inspection, and muster for pay. 
S. D. Harding, of Worcester, temporarily a visitor, was invited 
to accompany the Lieut. Colonel in the discharge of this 
duty ; but, like a wise man, he allowed his discretion to get the 
better of his zeal, and made an early retreat from the severity 
of the weather. 

To-day s mail brought details for the Lieut. Colonel and 
Major, as members of a Court Martial, ordered to assemble in 
Alexandria. 

March $d. The sensation among the officers to-day, is the 
formal opening of the ik Ripley House " so called ; a small, but 
select place of entertainment, under the immediate supervision 
of Lieut. Ripley, of F, where the officers of that company, are 
to board those of E, and a portion of those of A and B. 

During the temporary absence of Adj t Woods, who has left 
to deliver at fort Delaware our two men sentenced to hard 
labor at the Rip-raps, Lieut. Lincoln acts as Adjutant. 

We are growling over our weather of to-day rain, hail, snow, 
thunder and lightning, and sunshine, each striving for mastery. 

4th. What a queer world is this of ours ! Here is our 
Colonel, an original anti-slavery man, and free soiler, and our 
Lieut. Colonel, an uncompromising u old line" Whig; the 
former giving a halting support to the late proclamation of the 
President, while the latter adopts it without any reservation. 
To make the matter still more singular, the latter, as a member 
of a General Court Martial, is to sit in judgment upon Lieut. 
Col. Beecher, of the 153d N. Y. Infty, (said to be the son of 
Henry Ward Beecher,) upon a charge, among others preferred, 
of disloyalty. Specification, in this, that " he, the said Lieut. 
" Col. Beecher, said that he would not fight to restore the 
" government, he would Ij3t the South go, slaves and all, he 
" would not fight to uphold the proclamation. If that was 
" what was wanted of him, he would join the South ! He 
u should fight where they paid best," iind other like expressions. 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 81 

There are additional charges of " insubordination," " dis- 
" obedience of orders," and " conduct unbecoming an officer 
"and a gentleman." Summarily stated, they all stand for 
general good for nothingness. 

7th. The regiment was reviewed by Hon. Amasa Walker, 
of North Brookfield, yesterday. Our boys are fu.rloughed by 
threes and fours, for all sorts of reasons, and for no reason at 
all ; save that they " want to go home ; " but thus far, nearly 
all applications for " leave of absence," made by officers, have 
been returned disapproved at Department Headquarters. Should 
this course be continued, it will almost pay to be " reduced to 
the ranks." In spite of disapproval at Headquarters, however, 
and through the influence of the member of Congress, from his 
district, a ten days leave of absence has been granted by the 
War Department, to Lieut. Smith, of D. The Chaplain, who 
left for home long ago, taking the remains of his little brother, 
who died in camp, has so over-stayed his time, as to be reported 
this morning " absent without leave." 

Lieut Hall, who has been on " sick leave " for months, returned 
to-day, a picture of perfect health. 

The Adj t also reached camp from his trip to Fort Dela 
ware. He reports that at every stage of his route, he received 
the highest compliments for the appearance of his guard. 

He tells also a good story : Before leaving the boat to turn 
over his prisoners, he gave each of them a glass of whisky. 
Tears started to the eyes of one of them, as he swallowed his 
portion ; and, to the Adjutant s inquiry if it was too strong, 
"Not that, Adjutant! not that," he replied. "Well! what are 
you crying for then?" "Why! why! Adjutant! I was think 
ing as how it would be three years before I got another taste!!!" 

Capt. Cooley, of K., is off duty, b}^ reason of loss of voice. 
We have also, ten or twelve men unable to speak a loud word ; 
hut in these cases, the loss of voice follows a long seige of 
typhoid fever ; whereas the Captain s attack is sudden, and 
without apparent cause. 

We had a pretty little excitement, about tattoo to-night, 
occasioned by the discharge of a musket in camp, and the 
unpleasant whiz over head of a missile of some sort. I thought 



THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

it passed over my head. The Surgeon, on the right, insists 
upon it that it grazed his tent. The Adjutant, Colonel, Quar 
termaster, and all on the left declare it passed near them. 
The Sentinel in the rear, says he was " near being hit" while 
the line officers, lower down the hill, just barely escaped^ if 
their statements are to be relied on. The explanation is, that 
the senior officer of the guard while inspecting the relief, about 
to be posted, ignorant that the junior officer had previously 
inspected, snapped the lock of a musket, and the man s ram-rod 
went flying diagonally over the camp. 

His officer will have hard work to account for it, as expended 
in service. 

15th. The second term of our " School for Officers," com 
menced this evening. Our first review and inspection, by Gen. 
Tyler in person, was had yesterday. Lieut. Jarvis, of the 
Massachusetts 14th, reported to-day, under orders to establish 
a signal station at this fort. 

The men received their extra pay yesterday, for work done 
upon the new defences. 

2F)th. The Adjutant, with a guard of one Sergeant, and four 
teen privates, left to-day for Fort Delaware, having in his 
custody twelve prisoners, sentenced to be kept there, at hard 
labor, for different periods. 

We have purchased, from the regimental fund, all necessary 
appliances, and to-day have started a tailor shop, having detailed 
seven men to repair old* and fit and re-make new clothing, for 
the men of the command. 

Lieut. Macomber, having recovered his health, reported to-day 
for duty. 

28th. About 9 P. M. last night we were disturbed by a cry 
of fire given in Alexandria ; soon after a second alarm was 
given for a fire in Fairfax Seminary Hospital, and a third for 
one a short distance in our own front. This last proceeded 
from the burning of an unoccupied building, upon the estate of 
George Mason, near by, and was undoubtedly incendiary. The 
camp was alarmed, and the officers of the guard, with a portion 
of the command went out to it. The result to us was, that 
Redoubts A., B. and C., were each occupied by one company of 
ours, and that Lieut. Cobb, with twelve picked men, was sent 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 88 

out on picket, at the junction of the Fredericksburg, and Mt. 
Vernon roads. 

And this is probably all that it will amount to, although we 
are now again in front ; not a picket between us and the 
Accotink, and our seven hundred and fifty effective men are 
the only support to works, which would require as many thous 
ands, to hold against determined attack. 

29A. " All quiet on the Potomac " and " raining like 
blazes." Our alarm of last night aroused the 142d New York, 
26th Michigan, and 1st District of Columbia, encamped about 
a mile from us. Alexandria was in a perfect fury of excite 
ment ; and this morning the walls of many of the houses in 
that city are adorned by huge placards, having at their head, 
the imprint of a lone star, of the first magnitude ; with " no 
levity Watch the 30th is the day!" in large print beneath. 

Our sick list is frightful ; and, after deliberation, we have 
organized what is termed by some " Lincoln s Cripple Brigade." 
" What s that? " " Well ! it is composed of men, who, like him 
of F, l don t find it just what they thought they should, and 
want to go home. Some who feign sickness ; some who, 
really sick at first, don t relish being returned to duty ; 
malingerers many shirks, all of them. 

Under orders to furnish a guard for the large amount of 
government property in the camp just vacated by the 27th 
Maine, and wholly unable to spare able bodied men for this 
duty and perform the other duties required of us, we have 
had a medical inspection of sick in quarters, and have selected 
the deaf, the moon blind, the lame of one leg, and those others, 
so afflicted with lameness as actually to halt on both limbs, 
and, assigning to the command of the body, non-commissioned 
officers marked for fidelity to duty, and strict obedience to 
orders, have determined to entrust to these men the safety of 
the property in question. As line was formed . in front of the 
Adjutant s quarters, many a bent form straightened, and more 
than one eye brightened, in anticipation of the discharge which 
these fellows flattered themselves they had tired us into grant 
ing them. How faces lengthened, as orders were issued to 
them to pack their knapsacks, and report again in llyht march- 



84 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

ing order. Sad, but laughable were the interviews at Head 
quarters, between many of these men and the commanding 
officer ! " Where are you going to send me, Colonel ? I can t 
do duty ! I have been excused for months." " Well, yes! but 
the duty will be light almost nominal merely to guard the 
property in the camp of the 27th Maine ! " " But, Colonel, I 
can t do that ! I can t walk beat ! You see I have to use a 
cane ! " " Never mind about that ! you may have a seat ! it 
isn t your legs which are wanted ! only your eyes, this time ! " 
" But, Colonel ! if the rebels should come ! " u Then you d be 
in the right place ! you can t run ! you d have to fight ! " 
" Well, Colonel ! if I must go, can t I ride there in the 
ambulance?" "Not a step, sir! you must walk there! our able 
bodied men have done your duty long enough ! They are, and 
have been overworked, and you must march, and remember, 
you will draw no rations till you reach your new camp ! " 
Support was promised them, in case of an attack, and with 
many and loud mutterings, the long procession straggled from 
the camp. It is literally true, that one man, upon being 
deprived of his cane, hobbled off limping on his well leg. 

Now, in none of these cases, can the surgeons, after the 
most careful examination detect any real disease. The deaf 
readily hear the sick call; the moon blind find no difficulty in 
making their way any where about camp, at any hour. They 
all sleep well, they all eat well ; and really, it seems as if 
there was nothing they couldn t do, except do duty. What a 
sell it would be if the Rebels should actually gobble them up ! 
But we shall make good soldiers of the most of them, yet. 
To -morrow we are to resume our labors on the new fortifica 
tions, five companies being ordered for the duty. 

Dr. Clark and wife, Capt. Pratt and wife, Capt. Cooley and wife, 
Quartermaster Rowland and wife, Capt. Leach, Dr. Smith and 
Lieut. Macomber, who has just returned to duty, after his pro 
tracted sickness, have gone to-day on a visit to Mount Vernon. 

April %d. Lieut. Smith, who has been long away on leave 
of absence, appears on the morning report as a deserter. 

We have purchased, by appropriation from the Regimental 
fund, complete kits and a lot of sole leather, and have organized 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 85 

a regimental shoe shop, where repairing is to be done at a cost 
to the men- of the bare expense of the materials. 

A general Court Martial, Lieut. Col. Lincoln, President, is 
to assemble to-morrow for the trial of Lieut. Schaumberger, 
3d Battalion, New York Artillery, for disobedience of orders 
and unmilitary conduct, in refusing, when thereto ordered, to 
take the Company under his command upon fatigue duty, to 
wit: the fortifications upon which -tee have so long been at 
work, basing his refusal upon the ground that as Artillery men 
his command was not liable to do such duty. 

Our weather the past few days has been severe. Violent 
rains, have alternated with severe snow storms, each accom 
panied with high winds. For some time past our teams have 
been unable to draw wood enough to supply the daily demands 
of the camp, and what has been accumulating in the Quarter 
master s hands has now become exhausted. Anticipating this 
state of things, requisition for fuel was made some days since 
upon the Post Quartermaster at Alexandria. The requisition 
was approved, and we were ordered to furnish a party of eighty 
men to proceed by rail towards Centreville and load a train of 
cars, thirteen of which were for our own wants. After loading 
these cars, the entire train was run by our camp to Washing- 
tori, where the wood was unloaded, and our party, under Lieut. 
H, were left to Avalk back, some eight miles, to our camp. 

Upon the report of these facts by this officer to Headquarters, 
a second requisition was made. As before, we were answered 
that u thirteen cars would be furnished for the use of the 84th 
Massachusetts, which would be required to detail a party of 
eighty men, properly officered to accompany the train, and load 
it for the use of the regiment." Lieut. L. was selected to 
command this party* The most express orders were given him 
to load the train, and " see to it" that the wood was left at the 
crossing in front of our camp. 

Having completed the first part of his duty, the Lieutenant 
was asked by the conductor of the train, where he wished his 
party to be left. "At our camp, of course, with the wood," 
was the reply. " But I shall carry the wood to the city," said 
the conductor, " But the train was provided for our use, and 
8 



86 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

upon our requisition," said the Lieutenant. u I don *t care for 
that, I shall run the train to Alexandria." "And I shall obey 
my orders, and stop it at the crossing," said the Lieutenant. 
As the train rolled along, the Lieutenant inquired of the 
conductor, if he would stop at our crossing, but received no 
reply. The speed was gradually increased, till the rate of 
running, as it nearcd our camp, was frightful. At a signal 
given by the Lieutenant, his party applied the brakes. It was 
friction against steam, with the advantage in favor of the 
former, and the train came to a dead stop, before our crossing 
was reached. "What does this mean. Lieutenant?" asked the 
conductor. " That the train has stopped," said the Lieutenant. 
" Well, I order you to take off the brakes, and let it go on." 
" Not unless you will promise to leave our wood at our 
crossing." "I ll report you at Headquarters, for obstructing a 

train" "Report, and be d d,-I have obeyed my orders !" 

So the engine was detached, and the conductor, denouncing in 
unmeasured language the soldiers in general, and this party in 
particular, steamed away, leaving our party in possession of the 
field, and its trophies. 

A good joke is current in the Brigade, while though not 
strictly correct, perhaps, is nevertheless substantially true. 
An order from the office of the War Department directed 
that the Republicans in the 1st and 10th Connecticut Volun 
teers, R. O. Tyler, Acting Brigadier General, commanding, 
to the number of four hundred, be granted furloughs in order 
to go home and vote at the election soon to be held in that 
State. Now, Gen. Tyler and Col. Abbott of the 1st, and 
Lieut. Col. Kellogg of the 10th, are each Democrats, and the 
deuce is to pay. Col. Kellogg, upon receipt of this order, left 
his command, and tendered his resignation. This was returned 
to him unaccepted. So he summoned to his presence Major 
Smith, his next in rank, and required him to receipt for the 
Regimental property. This he declined to do : thereupon the 
Lieutenant Colonel showed (^some say kicked), the Major out 
of his tent, wrote and forwarded his resignation a second time, 
packed his valise, and departed for home. Notwithstanding 
this, the work of furloughing the men is going bravely on.

Our men have had their first practice with shotted guns; 
twenty pounds parrotts, with shell. The targets were at 
distances of three quarters, and one and three quarter miles 
away. As a whole, the firing was good, the shots all being 
good line shots, hut many of them falling short, the fuse being 
bad, requiring to be cut two inches long, when one and three 
quarters should have been sufficient. Three, only of our twenty 
live shots, hit the target. 

\~t/i. In the absence of the Colonel, at (\ A. M., orders were 
received for the regiment to move to-morrow morning, with 
seven days rations, three cooked ; three wall tents allowed the 
Held and staff, and a shelter tent to each line officer. Baggage 
to be confined to a small valise to each officer. 

(Jen. Tyler, reporting to Headquarters, "that, the 34th 
Massachusetts from its acquaintance with the surrounding 
country, its good .drill and discipline, and especially its pro 
ficiency in the school of Artillery, is of more value than any 
troops which can be sent to replace it," asks to have the order 
countermanded, which is done. 

Capt. Cooley, who has received leave of absence on account 
of aphonia, will leave for home at once. He takes with him 
Mrs. A. 1). Pratt and his own wife, Mrs. Dr. Clark having left 
some time since. Lieut. Macomber is still too unwell to 
accompany us. Lieut. Butler, awaiting sentence of general 
Court Martial, and Lieut. Stiles in arrest, and to be tried, are 
both to be left behind. 



88 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Lieut. Lincoln is placed in arrest for his conduct as com 
mander of the " wood party," by orders from Gen. Heintzle- 
man, and Gen. Tyler is ordered to investigate and report upon 
his conduct in the affair. 

18/i. We still remain ; no orders to move having reached us, 
though other regiments have left. 

All applications by our men for furloughs have been returned 
refused. Walsh, of A, while walking with a companion along 
the banks of Hunting Creek, was struck by a ball fired by one 
of the 153d New York, City Guard. Notwithstanding the 
wound, which is serious, the abdomen being pierced, the man 
walked into camp, and to the hospital. Upon examination 
the surgeons pronounce the wound fatal. 

By orders from Headquarters defences of Washington, we 
have been ordered to detail a company to guard the property 
left by the 3d (Abercrombie s,) Brigade, which has marched 
away. Company I, Capt. Soley, has been selected for the 
duty, and he maintains regal state at his Headquarters near 
Cloud s Mills. 

Our former Sergeant, Tannatt, called upon us to-day, sport~ 
ing the dress of a 2cl Lieutenant. 

23d. Upon the report of Gen. Tyler, Lieut. Lincoln is 
released from arrest, and returned to duty. In communicating 
the discharge, the Regimental General Order compliments the 
Lieutenant " upon his exact compliance with his orders, and 
his good conduct in the affairfrfor which he was complained of. 

It is raining a perfect flood, and Hunting Creek, in our front, 
has overflowed its banks. The water upon the road is above 
the beds of our wagons. 

2th. We have been paid off up to March 1st, and the 
money seems to burn in the pockets of some of the men. ," A " 
has nine in the guard house, drunk, and eleven other absentees 
from tattoo roll call. B is striving hard not to be outdone. A 
patrol, from the guard quarters, has just brought into camp 
one of A s men, who was found drunk, sitting down in the 
mud, and water, on the banks of the creek, waiting, as he said, 
u for the plaguey stuff to run out." 

21th. Our man Walsh is improving, and will get well. 



WINTER QUARTERS AT FORT LYON. 89 

At the close of the inspection to-day, the Brigadier-General 
commanding rode into camp, as the companies last inspected, 
C, E and G, were about to be dismissed. At his request, they 
were again ordered to "prepare for inspection," and were sub 
jected by him to a critical examination, at the close of which he 
exclaimed : " Beautiful ! beautiful ! " 

2Stk. Gen. Tyler, of late in command " of the Defences of 
Washington, south of the Potomac," has been relieved, and 
Col. Tannatt, of our 14th, assigned temporarily thereto. Col. 
Abbott, of the 1st Connecticut, is placed at the head of our 
brigade, and our Col. has mounted and ridden away to Wash 
ington. 

3Qth. General orders, " Headquarters Defences of Washing 
ton," just received, assign "Col. G. D. Wells, of the 34th 
Massachusetts Infantry, to the command of Forts Worth, Ells 
worth, and Lyon, and Redoubts A, B, C, and D ; the whole 
to be designated the " 2d Brigade, Defences south of the 
Potomac," and the A. B. G. is directed to garrison the Redoubts 
immediately. 

By brigade orders of same date, "Lieut. Col. Lincoln, com 
manding the 34th Massachusetts, is directed, at once, so to 
dispose of his command, as to comply with said general order." 
Accordingly, Companies A and F, Capt. Chandler commanding, 
are assigned to Redoubt " C," Companies E and G, Capt Bacon 
commanding, to Redoubt B, and B and D, Capt. Potter com 
manding, to Redoubt " A." The^ remaining companies under the 
immediate command of the Lieut. Colonel will encamp in rear 
of this line of Redoubts. These earth works have been con 
structed by us, and the men feel a commendable pride in them. 
A spirit of rivalry, between the several commands, is already 
apparent, and even now, men from each redoubt are scouring 
the country, in search of sound frurf, with which to sod their 
magazines, bomb proofs, and parapets. If only they are per 
mitted to remain in occupancy long enough, these redoubts 
will be little jewels in the line of defences, of which we may 
well enough feel proud ! 

This change is especially welcomed by our medical staff, as 
it puts us upon high land, away from the malarial influences of 



90 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

the creek, near which we have so long been encamped, and to 
which much of our sickness is undoubtedly owing. 

To unable us properly to meet our new responsibilities, the 
Quarter-master laid upon our tables our allowance of stationery 
for the ensuing quarter. See how luxuriously our necessities 
are supplied ! For instance, the Government s allowance to the 
Regimental Commander is two quires of letter, and one quire 
of fools-cap paper; twenty-five envelopes, one pen-holder, and 
ten steel pens, one lead pencil ; two sticks of sealing wax, one- 
fourth ounce wafers, and (only} one piece of red tape, and yet, 
in any and every official communication he forwards, he is 
required to use at least a half sheet of paper.

HISTORIC GROUND. POLICING CAMP. REGIMENTAL GROWTH. 
DISCHARGES FROM REGIMENT. FORT "ALL HAZARDS." 

SPORTS. REGIMENTAL FUND. INSPECTION. DRILLS. 

INJUNCTIONS TO VIGILANCE. PAY DAY. 

May 4th. While busily engaged in preparing for occupation 
the new redoubts upon which we have so long labored, in 
obedience to orders of the 1st instant, other orders reached us 
after taps last night, which directed us to march at once, and 
occupy this post. Notwithstanding our unsettled condition 
the regiment was reported "inline, ready to march in two 
hours, after receipt of its new order. 

We find the llth Massachusetts Battery, Capt. Jones, in 
position here, occupying a small earthwork, near the house 
of a Mr. Upton, for whom the hill is named, and in which, 
Col. Wells, commanding post, takes up his quarters. The 84th 
will pitch its tents upon ground lately occupied by the 
Brigade, Pennsylvania Reserves ; so soon as it can be policed 
sufficiently to be habitable. At present the filth is abominable. 

We are upon historic ground. " Munson s Hill," an eminence 
on our left, is famous for having opposed insurmountable 
obstacles to McClellan s advance at an earlier stage of the war. 
Our position commands it, and is itself, in turn, commanded by 
" Miner s Hill," to our right. Old Rebel earthworks are visible 
all around us. We have pickets out in all directions, our position 
being an isolated one, in advance, and Mosby hovering about. 
We left at Fort Lyon the Surgeon arid Quartermaster, to 
make arrangement for the proper disposal of the hospital and 
camp. Macomber, who is sick, Stiles and Butler who are 



92 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

in arrest, and the Chaplain were all left behind. Sergeant 
Wood s wife, alone of all our woman kind, accompanied the 
regiment on its march. The men stood the march well, spite 
of their heavy knapsacks, one of which, and that carried by 
one of our smallest men, actually weighed ninety pounds. Our 
chief tailor rather than trust his "goose," with the equipage 
left behind, put it into his knapsack, and actually backed it 
the whole way. 

1th. We are enjoined, in orders, to the utmost vigilance, 
permitting no one to go through our lines, unless provided with 
a pass from Headquarters at Washington. Our drills are 
resumed, both company and batttalion. 

The work of getting our camp clean is as yet incomplete. 
How filthy these Dutchman were ! The holes they dug in the 
ground, and covered with their " A " tents, are reeking with 
old shoes, clothing, rotting straw, and half decomposed meat, 
bones and bread. 

Our camp is laid out in the shape of a parallelogram ; on one 
side in orderly streets, are the tents of the men; directly 
opposite are those of the line officers ; the quarters of the field 
and staff are at one end, opposite to which is the entrance to 
the camp, flanked at one side by the quarters of the guard. 
The open space between these is reserved for our parades and 
guard mountings. 

Lieut. Butler rejoined us to-day. At the request of Col. 
Wells, the sentence imposed upon him has been remitted, and 
he restored to duty. The Chaplain also rejoined us. We have 
enjoyed a good laugh at his expense, he having engaged in 
and enjoyed a game of ball last Sunday, having forgotten what 
day of the week it was. 

$th. The Quartermaster rejoined us to-day, having completed 
the transfer of government property, for which he was 
accountable, at Fort Lyon. How stuff accumulates in camp ; 
or, to put it in another light, how a regiment grows ? One week 
ago to-night we left our old quarters, with three of our wagons 
well loaded. Since that time, these teams have made one, and 
sometimes two trips daily ; and to-day, we had a government 
train of twenty-one four-horse teams, loaded down with " our 



UPTON S HILL. 93 

things ; " and the whole are not here yet. Besides, we have 
stored in Alexandria our company camp ranges, or cook 
stoves, which cost us $50 each ; and turned over to the Post 
Quartermaster at Alexandria, about two hundred and fifty 
cords of wood, one hundred and fifty muskets, and a consider 
able quantity of ammunition and rations. 

At parade to-night, the first since leaving Fort Lyon, cheer 
upon cheer were given by the boys of the llth Battery, who 
had assembled to witness our movements. This Battery is to 
report in Washington, on the 18th, preparatory to being mus 
tered out. The Colonel, who has been in Washington the past 
few days, returned to-night, bringing information that orders are 
to be issued for our junction with t?ie Army of the Potomac ; 
Gen. Hooker in his request for more troops, having specially 
designated the 34th Massachusetts as wanted bv him. 

tD ty 

llf/i. The sun scalds down oppressively upon the bare space 
which our tents enclose ; and the dust, which fifty sweepers 
raise upon our parade ground is unendurable. The fact that the 
wind blows strongly towards Headquarters, probably is an 
inducement to every sweeper to use his broom vigorously. 
Surgeon Clark reached camp to-day, bringing up all the sick 
that could be removed, and twenty!! wagon loads of Hospital 
tents and stores. He has discharged jive men this last week, 
and sent ten to general hospital, all of which will probably be 
discharged. 

Our rolls show our strength to be eight hundred and sixty- 
seven, rank and file. 

Up to this time, we have kept our sick with us, and the 
unremitting care and attention of our medical staff has probably 
saved us many whom otherwise we should have lost. At one 
time, our sick list was frightful. Rheumatism, Fever, (mostly 
Typhoid,) Measles, Small Pox, Homesickness, and a thousand 
and one ills, mostly indescribable, weighed us down ; and medi 
cal inspectors examined our reports, and medical directors 
ordered the transfer of large numbers of our men to general 
hospital. But still we held to them all ; enlarging our accom 
modations and adding new comforts and conveniences to our 
hospital. Bodies of green sashed officers descended in person 



94 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

upon our camp, to see, with their own eyes the execution of 
their orders; and, after inspecting our sanitary arrangements, 
left with high appreciation of the skill and attention of our 
surgeons, and Avell deserved compliments for the perfect work 
ing of the means our ingenuity had adopted for the comfort 
and recovery of our patients. So that, till the movement to 
this post, we have lost no men by having them swallowed 
up in these general hospitals. Alas ! that it can be no longer 
so! 

Oh, dear, the horrors of war ! We have no market, and the 
country round is literally bare of everything. How we of the 
shoulder straps envy the boys, whom the government provides 
liberally with hard tack and pork ; while our caterer leaves us 
to laugh and grow fat upon our regular dish, at all meals, of 
sardines and lemons. 

Companys I and D, Capt. Thompson commanding, have just 
marched out to occupy Fort " Buffalo ;" or, as the boys call it, 
Fort " All Hazards" from an expression used in the order 
detailing them to the occupancy of the work. 

14/. Phew ! how it blows, and how cold and raw it is ! A 
terrible storm is raging, with such gusts of wind as threaten 
the safe standing of our tents. 

11th. What a change in our camp since reaching this post ! 
One wouldn t know the boys to be the same. Songs, stories, 
ball playing, mock parades, are the order of the day ! At 
reviellie this morning, our eyes were greeted with a " Sibley 
stove," mounted on a " tripod," the pipe directed to the tents 
of the line officers. The boys were photographing the officers 
as they made their appearance on the parade. The pantomime 
of putting in front of the stove a piece of board, on which was 
roughly drawn a charcoal sketch, using it for a negative, cov 
ering it with a shelter tent, and running for dear life behind a 
blanket, suspended near by, as a screen ; pouring a pailful of 
water over it, and re-appearing and submitting it to the inspec 
tion of the bystanders, was side-splitting. 

To-night the whole camp has been convulsed with the imita 
tion of the Light Battery drill, by the boys, under the immediate 
management and command of Anderson of B, who will be 



UPTON S HILL. 95 

remembered as the owner of a peculiar uniform, of his own 
designing, at Fort Lyon. 

We have put into full operation again, our tailors, shoemakers, 
blacksmiths, and armorers shops, all with complete outfit of 
tools, and such stock as is necessary ; and all, save the armorers, 
purchased with the money raised among ourselves. In addition 
we have bought our Band instruments, boxing gloves, and foot 
balls, besides checker and back-gammon boards for the hospital, 
and have over five hundred dollars in the Regimental Fund. 
All this money has been raised by monthly assessment upon the 
officers, in amount, proportioned to their rank. 

llth. To-day was occupied by another inspection, the third 
within a week, all of them by orders from Washington. This 
finished, the boys hurried to witness the drill of Jones Battery. 
It was perfect. 

\$th. In return for the gratification afforded us by the drill 
of the battery, the forenoon was occupied by battalion, and the 
afternoon by regimental skirmish drill, by request of Captain 
Jones and his officers. W. 0. Smith of II, left us to-day, 
commissioned to one of the regiments of colored troops, now 
forming at home. 

23c?. At the request of " the Boys," all drills have been 
suspended, that they might engage in a regular game of foot 
ball ; wing against wing, the Lieutenant Colonel acting as 
umpire. The weather was intensely hot; the game sharply 
contested ; and, in their desire to win, many of the boys reduced 
their clothing to shirts, drawers, and stockings. The Colonel, 
who has been absent in Washington a day or two, drove into 
camp with a party of lady friends, but turned away at seeing 
the condition of the men, and subsequently administered a 
sharp reprimand for what he was pleased to call the " indecent 
exhibition." 

Jones Battery is relieved by one from Michigan. 

Col. DeRussey succeeds to the command, from which Col. 
Tannett has been relieved ; and by his orders, our pickets are 
largely increased, Alexandria having been badly scared last 
night, by a Rebel force, on the Mt. Vernon road. The inhab 
itants of the neighboring farms are thronging Regimental 



96 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Headquarters, (the post commander being absent), asking for 
guards to protect their property. But all applications of the 
kind are refused. 

26th. We have been blessed with the always welcome 
presence of the Paymaster, to-day, who pays up to the first of 
this month. Robert J. Hamilton of I received his discharge 
to-day, to accept his commission in the Massachusetts 54th. 

Renewed injunctions to " strengthen our pickets," and to 
" increased vigilance," reach us from Headquarters at Wash 
ington. 

Rapid artillery firing, and the quick galloping into our camp 
of a party of light artillery men, caused us to stand to our arms, 
last night, but nothing came of it. 

27 tli. A special messenger from Washington brings renewed 
injunctions "to the exercise of the utmost vigilance." The 
authorities there seem to be panic stricken. Our pickets have 
just brought in an officer of the 12th Michigan cavalry, on his 
way to his command. He was without the countersign, having 
been officially informed in Washington that our pickets had 
been gobbled. 

What a heap of trouble attends pay-day ; and how sure is 
liquor to be had wherever troops are stationed. How it is 
procured so readily, puzzles us all. Within a circle of a half 
mile there may be six houses. Our men leave camp, and in a 
short time return so drunk that it is a wonder how they 
manage to get back at all. Last night a drunken fracas in 
" B " was settled by sending three of her men to the guard 
tents. " A " soon made a contribution of four to the same 
quarter; then "B" added another in the person of one who, 
after being paid off, visited Alexandria without leave ; and 
" A," not to be outdone, contributed still another to this Avell 
established hotel ; altogether, there was too much whiskey ; 
Clary of A was tied to a post at the guard tent. Being the 
first punishment of this nature, the boys, already excited, lost 
themselves, and loud cries of " fall in," " fall in," " cut him 
down," "cut him down," attracted attention. Capt. B, officer 
of the day, jewel of an officer that he is, was quickly upon the 
ground, and soon quieted the disturbance. 



UPTON S HILL. 97 

The bugles now sounded the assembly, and a drill followed, 
long enough and sharp enough to take any superfluous vim 
out of these fellows; but A., Lieutenant of the Guard, has 
just reported that the mutterings in camp are loud, and to 
enquire if he shall not call for an addition to his guard. He 
gets no comfort beyond the assurance that he is responsible for 
the quiet and order of the camp. Now, at tattoo, another Lieu 
tenant commanding reports one of his Sergeants beastly drunk, 
unable to stand, or answer to his name, and asks for advice as 
to his own course in the matter. There is but one rule in such 
cases, as he is reminded. But the Sergeant is the son of rich 
and influential parents, who aided largely in getting up the 
company, and whom the Lieutenant dares not offend. So it is 
plain that Headquarters must act, and the stripes are torn from 
the man s arm. 

31s. We are guarding a camp occupied by hundreds of 
contrabands, of both sexes and all ages, which has been lately 
established on our flank. The poor creatures are grateful 
enough for the safety which our uniform guarantees to them. 

All work is suspended in camp, and a large detail of the 
boys, armed with axes mostly, some with pick or shovel, are 
hard at work obstructing the highwa} r leading to our position, 
and by slashes and otherwise, so blocking all Avood-paths and 
by-ways as to render them impassable for Cavalry. This, in 
pursuance of orders from Gen. Heintzelman, who, with his 
staff, is this side the river, superintending in person the 
obstruction of the approaches to Washington. Notwithstanding 
all this, and other indications of a scare in that city, the Lieut. 
Colonel commanding, and Capt. Fox, are detailed as members 
of a Court Martial ordered to assemble to-morrow at Fort 
Anthony, seven miles from here.

June 2d. Everything like labor was suddenly suspended 
yesterday, by receipt of orders to hold ourselves in readiness to 
move, the moment we were relieved by the " Brigade of Penn 
sylvania Reserves, now in motion." Our march of the day was 
one of only nine miles ; but the sun was burning hot, and the 
dust stifling. The road was obstructed, in many places, by 
huge trees, placed, abattis like, across the way, which rendered 
our progress difficult and tedious. Proceeding through George 
town, and down the avenue, as we neared the White House, the 
bugles sounded "attention." The gaunt form of the President 
was discovered at the gate, in front of the White House, and 
orders were sent down for a marching salute as we passed. 
Our army of dogs being sent back to the cover of our wagons, 
the regiment formed in column of companies, the band struck 
up a patriotic march, and with lines beautifully dressed, and 
arms glittering in the sun, the regiment looked and marched 
splendidly. 

Judge of the unutterable disgust with which, as drawing 
near to the President, in the conceit that our appearance could 
not fail of eliciting complimentary notice, we heard him enquir 
ing, " What regiment is it ? " " Where is it from ? " "And how 



WASHINGTON. 99 

dare they disobey the order mustering out of service, all regi 
mental bands ! " 

Gen. Martindale, to whom we reported, paid us the compli 
ment of saying, that "he had ordered us into the city, in conse 
quence of the flattering reports made to him of our excellence in 
drill and discipline." In the hurry of our getting off, Anderson 
of B, and Thurman of D deserted. 

4th. Our duties here commenced yesterday, by sending to 
the " Carroll Hill " and " Old Capitol " Prisons, a guard of one 
hundred and twenty-five men each. 

To-day, we detail fifty men to the depot of the Baltimore & 
Ohio Railroad. 

Capt. Cooley returned to us yesterday, not having regained 
his voice, as we hoped he would. 

Lieut. Smith, who left us last March, was returned to us 
to-day ironed, and in custody of an officer specially detailed, in 
Boston, to see to his safe delivery to us. Charges of desertion 
are to be preferred against him, and lie will be sent to Court 
Martial. We occupy wooden barracks, erected upon a square 
on East Capital Street, a few rods from the Capitol itself. 

Company** U A" and " F," "C" and - k K," and the Q. M. 
occupy the buildings on one side of the ..square. Opposite 
them are U G" and " K," " D " and ^ H," and bw I " and B." 
Headquarters are in a low building next the street ; and at 
the other extremity is the hospital. Tins is on the second 
storv, occupying a room about twenty-five by forty, well lighted 
and yentilatcd, suitably proyided with comfortable hunks. 

We have raised, in the center of this room, a framed platform, 
upon which are roses, geraniums, and other plants, in full 
bloom. 

After moving from these quarters many wagon loads of old 
boots, shoes, bones, and other abominations, we are comfortably 
clean and sweet. 

The boys are put upon honor, for the most part, in the matter 
of leaving camp. " Passes" are furnished, almost without stint ; 
the men being required to present themselves at the Guard 
Quarters, upon going out and returning to camp ; shoes, belts, 
&c., polished, clothes brushed clean, and the number of the 



100 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

regiment, and the letter of their company conspicuous on their 
caps. One hundred and forty-four visited the city yesterday, 
all of whom returned sober, and many of them before the 
expiration of their allotted time. 

Col. Wells is detailed as member of the Hoard to examine 
applicants for commissions in Regts. of colored troops, and Lieut. 
Col. Lincoln is president, and Capts. Bacon and Fox members, 
and Lieut. H. Bacon, Judge Advocate -of General Court 
Martial, to sit daily. 

1th. The wives of a goodly number of our men have reached 
us, and more are coming; for whose accommodation tents are 
pitched, on land near, but outside Regimental quarters. 

The compliment of an order from General Headquarters, 
directing the Provost Guard of the city to report all passes 
issued from our own Headquarters, has been paid us. 

In spite of a cold Northeast wind which rendered us all 
uncomfortable, we had our regular inspection, and evening 
parade ; at the latter of which, a large number of spectators, 
many of them in uniform, were present. 

Capt. Meigs, who has general supervision of the State 
prisoners, and their guard, during a call to-day, amused us 
much with an account of his experience with one of our 
sentinels. In going his accustomed rounds, he dismissed the 
Sergeant, who had formed his escort, and continued his way 
alone. As he proceeded, "You can t pass here, sir," fell sharply 
on his ears ; accompanied with the ring of the metal, as the 
musket was brought down. Turning upon the sentinel, the 
Captain asked, " What are your instructions ? " " None of 
your business, sir!" Attempting to advance, came the sharp 
" halt, or I fire ! " " What are your instructions guard, that 
you stop me in my rounds ? " asked the Captain. " None of 
your business," was again the answer. " Straightening myself, 
with a dignity becoming my position," said the Captain, "I 
ordered 4 Recover your piece ! I am your commanding officer ; 
and must pass." Sentinel : "I don t know you sir ! My Lieuten 
ant is my commanding officer, and I am yours, now ; so, stand 
back!" Captain "What are the bounds of your beat?" 
Sentinel "None of your business!" Captain "Where 



WASHINGTON. 101 

does this passage lead ? " Sentinel " none of your business ! " 
Captain "Are there other guards near you?" Sentinel 
"None of your business!" Captain "Well, I am Capt. 
Meigs, and my business is to superintend this prison, and its 
guard, and I order you to let me pass." Sentinel "I ve hearn 
tell of Capt. Meigs, but I don t know him, nor any one but my 
own officer, while I am sentinel, so stand back, sir ! " " And," 
said the Captain, " By Jove, Colonel, I backed down, for the 
first time in my experience, and used your guns as a mirror by 
which to curl my moustache." 

Our pieces are indeed brought to a high degree of polish ; so 
highly polished are they, that we have been charged with 
having them silver plated. With these, and the scales, which 
we are to don to-morrow, by general order, and the white 
gloves, and well blacked equipments, of old date, we shall 
indeed be the "Dandy Soldiers" Gen. Tyler would have us. 

Our eight hundred men replace the eighteen hundred, or 
thereabouts, of the Brigade of Penn Reserves, {Bucktails), 
which we- relieved. Capt. Parker, of Gen Mar tin dale s Staff 
tells us, that the General asked, as a personal favor, that we 
might be ordered to report to him for duty. 

Connected with our duty at the railroad station, a good joke 
has occurred. While on duty there, Lieut. Hortori in command, 
heard the sentinel, on post at the door, call " Turn out the 
guard ; " and as he thought, add, "Officer of the day." The 
men sprang to their arms, and the Lieutenant placed himself at 
their head, to do the proper thing. Seeing no officer, nor, in his 
opinion, any person who was entitled to a salute, he brought his^ 
men to an " Order," and stepped to the door, to see for himself, 
who was approaching. 

" Why didn t you salute the President, Lieutenant ? " asked 
Capt. Mix, who has the station in charge. " President ! what 
President?" asked H. "I havn t seen anybody who looked 
like a President ! " " Look there, then" said the Captain, point 
ing to the long, lean figure of " Old Abe," who, with uncovered 
head, was bowing to the guard, as he shuffled down their front. 
Poor H. felt bad enough; but was consoled by the statement of 
Capt. M. that the honest old soul could not tell "Present arms * 
9 



102 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

from any other movement ; in proof of which, said he, " look 
at him, returning to your men, his acknowledgements for the 
salute, they ought to, but have not, paid him." 

A detail, just ordered, takes from camp every man fit for 
duty. 

Emerson (Sergeant) of K was discharged to-day, to accept 
promotion in colored troops. 

~LQth. We, in camp, were startled to-day by a musket shot, 
which, upon inquiry, was found to have been fired by one of 
our sentinels, at the old Capitol Prison ; an honest, straight 
forward, well meaning young fellow, but green as grass; and 
the following is the man s own account of the matter, as told 
to a comrade after reaching quarters. 

" Now Bill" he says to his comrade, "I vow, I don t know 
" what got into me. You see, I had never been on that beat 
" before, and the fellow who was there when I was posted, 
" only told me not to let any body pass. But he never told me 
" how to stop em, least wise he never told me to fire. So, when 
" I see a fellow, with his head and shoulders out of the 
" window, I told him to halt, but the plaguey fool did n t, and 
" I up and called out Corporal of the guard ! Upon that the 
" confounded Rebel he thought he d get back, and I ordered 
44 him to halt again, and sung out for the Corporal of the guard ! 
" But before he d got along the Corporal, I mean Joe 
" Webber you know him Bill and an all-fired lazy fellow he 
" is, too Capt. Meigs, he came along confound him, he s 
" just like our Lieut. Colonel, down right on to a fellow before 
" he knows it ; and says he, guard ! what are you making such a 
44 noise about ? What are you calling the Corporal of the guard 
" for ? This is n t your camp ! Well no ! Capt. says I. I guess I 

" know that, but what shall I do ? and just then, the d d 

" old Reb., he caught sight of the Capt. and tried to slip back, 
" and I sung out halt ! and the Capt. says he, what s that for? 
" and then he caught sight of the grey back, and says he, shoot 
"the cuss! and says I, what for? and the Capt. he looked me 
" over, and says he, where did you come from ? and I told 
" him from old Massachusetts? and I belonged to the 34th, 
" Col. Wells ! and I guessed Col. Wells knew what was what, 



WASHINGTON. 103 

" as well as any Capt. there was ! So then, the Capt. says he, 
" Guard, what are your instructions ? and I told him the fool 
"didn t give me any. Well, says he, if any person tries to 
pass your beat, you stop em, and if any prisoner tries to get 
" out, you shoot em ! and I told him I would, just so. 

" Well, a little while after this, I caught sight of that same 
" eternal, all fired, mean Reb., sticking his head out of the 
" window again, and I told him just to put it back, but he 
" did n t mind, and I up and let drive at him, but the old gun 
"didn t shoot straight. I swan, I got just as good a bead on 
" him as you ever saw, but it was an all fired mean place 
" to shoot in ! 

" Well, when I found I did n t hit, I tell you Bill, I felt 
" cheap enough ! I could n t get reconciled, no how ! I knowed 
" that Capt. would be along, and I was thinking what to tell 
" him, when sure enough, he popped on to me, and says he, 
" guard, what in hell are you doing ! What are you wasting 
" ammunition for ? I a int doing no such thing Capt. says I ; 
" I was trying to see how near I could come to that Rebel s 
" head and not hit it, and says I, Capt. I 11 bet anything the 
" ball just singed him ! Confound your singeing, says he ! I 
" don t want any guard of mine should miss, when he fires ! 
"Don t you now, Capt? don t you really? If I d only just 
"known that before! just let me draw another bead on him, 
" if that s the case, and he s a gone er ! I can shoot some, Capt. 
"I can that! and you just get the fool to put his head out 
" again, and you 11 see who can shoot, and who can t ! 

There was not so much in the story itself, but the man s 
manner of telling it was inimitable. 

Lieut. Lincoln with "I," and Lieut. A. C. Walker with " H," 
Lieut. Lovell with "A," and Lieut. Macornber with " E," 
guard the "Old Capitol" and "Carroll Hill" prisons, on 
alternate days. Lieut. Hortou with " G," alternates with Platt 
and the men of " K " at the Railroad Depot. Lieut. Bacon, 
with thirty men, goes to-morrow to Philadelphia, having charge 
of a party of deserters from the Rebel army, who, having taken 
the oath of allegiance to Uncle Sam, are assigned to that city 
as an abiding place. Lieut. Hall with thirty men is now absent 



104 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

on similar duty in New Jersey. Lieuts. Butler and Van Loan 
have charge of invalid detachments, at two of the neighboring 
hospitals. Lieut. S. of " D " is in arrest, waiting trial on 
charges preferred against him ; Lieut. S. of " A " waiting 
sentence of Court Martial, and Lieut. L. of " D " has complied 
with request from Headquarters, and sent in his resignation, 
which has gone forward, approved. 

E lost a man to-day under peculiar circumstances. He was 
taken sick yesterday, and excused from duty ; answered at 
Surgeon s call this morning, and was ordered into hospital, 
where he died this afternoon. 

12th. We sent out to-day a detail of one commissioned and 
two non-commissioned officers and twenty men, as guard over 
a large party of wounded, but convalescent soldiers, en route 
to hospital in New Jersey. Our party looked splendidly, all 
leather as black as the ace of spades, all brass brighter than a 
new dollar, and the guns, well, as Capt. P. says, one wanted 
smoked glass through which to look at them. 

One of E s men was missing at morning roll call ; his clothes, 
watch and money, still at the head of his bunk, seemed to 
indicate a somnambulistic leave taking. A man of A also 
disappeared in the night, but as he left the guard house and 
walked off with the iron wristlets with which he was adorned, 
we concluded he knew what he was about. 

Again our last man is taken from camp, by orders to relieve 
a guard from the 157th New York, which regiment is ordered 
to the front. 

16th. We were called upon this afternoon for a party to be 
marched instantly to the " Soldiers retreat," to quell a dis 
turbance made by some men, who, their time of service having 
expired, refused to obey the orders of any one. Lieut. Cobb 
in command, succeeded admirably in carrying out his orders, 
and quiet was speedily restored. 

18th. At inspection to-day two of the boys were so over 
come by the heat as to drop in their places. The thermometer 
was at 108. Notwithstanding the heat, our parade was had at 
an earlier hour than usual, to gratify the inspecting officer, and 
other officers from Gens. Heintzleman s and Martindale s Head 
quarters, who desired to witness it. 



CHAPTER XI. 



WASHINGTON. 

LIEUT. LO YELL S EXPEDIENCE TWO CASES OF PUNISHMENT 
A CASE FOR "FURLOUGH." 

The resignation of Lieut. Lyman has been accepted ; and the 
Chaplain for general reasons, and Capt. Cooley, on account of 
impaired health, have forwarded theirs for approval. Capt. 
Soley and Lieut. Elwell returned to duty to-day, having been 
off on leave of absence. Capt. Lovell had quite a lively little 
affair while on duty yesterday, as officer of the guard, at the 
prison. 

Among the persons confined there is a large, muscular 
masculine looking woman, reported to have served as Orderly 
Sergeant in some Rebel organization. She is noisy and trouble 
some, and steadily sets at defiance all the rules for the govern 
ment of the prison. A carpenter having been sent into the 
entry, where her room is, to make some needed repairs, she 
flew into a passion, threw his tools out of one of the windows, 
and then turned upon, and actually kicked him out of the entry. 
The guard called his Corporal the Corporal his Sergeant 
and the Sergeant his officer. Lovell ordered her to be quiet, 
and she laughed at him ; he ordered her to her room, and 
she snapped her fingers in derision; he threatened to iron her, 
and she dared him to do so, adding that there wasn t a 
Yankee living who could do that. Waiting his opportu 
nity, Lovell caught her; she clinched; there was a struggle 
and a fall a succession of kicks and shrieks, and she was left 
- free to rise adorned with a pair of bracelets not usually 



106 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

worn for ornament ! Sullen and crestfallen, she retired to her 
room. 

21s. Distant cannonading was distinctly heard to-day, 
reported to be at Chantilly. We have a little army of old and 
young, grave and gay, ugly and pretty, all of them happy - 
wives, among us. For the most part, they take life as it comes ; 
making the most of what is agreeable, and accepting the 
unpleasant as inevitable. But a little incident of camp life 
disturbed the even current of the day, and afforded to the 
lookers-on a good deal of amusement. 

Wagner, of I, a great, burly Dutchman, too fond of liquor to 
be included in the prison guard, and therefore retained in camp, 
had got roariug drunk, somehow, and was made into what is 
technically called a " spread eagle." It so chanced that he was 
seen in this situation, by Mrs. Marth, the wife of a^. Corporal of 
G., and a fellow countryman. Almost frantic with excitement, 
the woman rushed to Headquarters with a complaint against 
the man s Captain, which she accompanied with a threat of 
carrying her complaint to Gen. Heintzleman, unless the man 
was instantly released. She was dismissed from Headquarters 
at once ; her threat, alike with her complaint, being disregarded. 
Camp was made hideous with her howling, and her husband 
was called and directed to take her to her quarters outside the 
camp. And now came the fun ! She d no idea of being con 
trolled, least of all, by her husband ; and, therefore, resenting 
his interference, she turned upon him, threw him into the 
gutter, and pounded him soundly. Was it in retaliation for 
this, we wonder, that he deserted last night ? More of our 
boys wives made their appearance to-day, one of whom had to 
give the conjugal embrace to her husband, in the guard house, 
in presence of an appreciative and sympathizing party of 
comrades. 

22cZ. Capt. Soley, with fifty men, and Lieut. Ammidon, 
with thirty, are off on special duty. Lieut. Cobb, with twenty- 
five men, starts for Philadelphia to-morrow, having in charge a 
body of rebel prisoners, to be delivered in that city. Lieut. 
Bacon, in command of a like squad, on similar duty, returned 
from that city to-day. He reports that the appearance of his 



WASHINGTON. 107 

party excited much attention. Capts. Fox and Pratt, and 
Lieut. Lyman, whose resignation has been accepted, left for 
home to-day ; the two former on short leaves of absence. 

June 23d. While sitting in my quarters to-day, a faint rap 
sounded on my door. In answer to my " come in," a young, as 
the sailors would say, " hermaphrodite-rigged " form appeared, 
and approaching with extended hand, in a pleasant, subdued 
voice, said : "This is Col. L., I believe. Jam Miss Dr. Walker, 
U. S. A." 

She was dressed in a close-buttoned, blue cloth frock, the 
skirts falling to her knees ; tight fitting black pants, and con 
gress boots ; and, twirled in her hands, an ivory handled sun 
shade. A jaunty little hat was perched upon a small, but well 
formed head, down each side of which long cork-screw curls 
were flowing. Beautiful eyes, a fair complexion, and a pretty 
chin, helped diminish the unfavorable impression produced by 
thin, pursed-up lips, and a sharp, almost transparent nose. 
" You have a private, Col., in your hospital, by the name of 

R s, in whom I have taken an interest, not for himself, 

precisely, but because of his health. He ought to have a 
furlough in fact, he must have one. Can t you give it to 
him ? " "I fear not, madam." " Then one must be procured 
through my influence," she continued. " I am very patriotic 
and the officers know that I never ask of them anything im 
proper to be granted. I spend my time in the hospital am 
just up from " Acquia Creek," where I have been for the last 
two months, and where I became much interested. Now Col., 
I don t knoiv how it is, but I am afraid you don t know Mr. 

R s, and I will tell you all about him." " On the contrary, 

Dr., I do know him perfectly well." " Yes, Col., as a soldier 
perhaps." " As a soldier, and patient both, Dr." " As a patient, 
Col.? Is it possible? what is his disease?" "Why Dr., the 
man has been in hospital under treatment, for months; first 
for measles, then for aphonia, and he now labors under a severe 
attack of what we call commission fever, for which time is the 
best and only remedy." " Oh, Col.! Oh, Col.! how can you 

say so ? I assure you, upon my honor, that Mr. R s is 

an extremely conscientious man, who wouldn t, for the world, 



108 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

practice any deception ! And I know he ought to have a fur 
lough ! " " Yes, but Dr. our Surgeons decline to give the 
necessary certificate." "But Col., Jam a Dr., you know, and I 
have prepared a certificate of the necessity of a furlough, to 
the recovery of the man s health." " Unfortunately, Dr., you 
a*re not our Surgeon!" "True, Col.! but you must be aware 
that the rules only require a certificate of ill health from a 
surgeon, and not, by any means, from the particular regimental 
Surgeon." 

" Certainly, my dear doctor, you state the requirement cor 
rectly ; but if the officers of the 34th have a weakness, it is 
of confining among themselves, everything relating to the 
morale, and discipline of the regiment." 

" How then, Col.! Don t you send charges to General Court 
Martial ? " " Oh ! now my dear miss, you " touch us on the 
raw!" If we like a man, no little matter can separate us. If 
circumstances arise, which require a little extra attention to 
him, the Captain takes him in hand ! If the disease is beyond 
the Captain s skill, or power, to cure, he falls into Headquarters 
hands ! Only, when we have made up our minds, that the 
interest of the 34th requires a permanent separation, do we 
send a man to General Court Martial ! " " Well, Col., I thank 

you for your frankness ; but I see, in this case of Mr. R s, 

you will force me to appeal to those of higher rank ! " " How I 
shall regret that, my dear doctor ! To have it said, that a lady 
had been forced to anything by an officer of the 34th, would 
mortify the whole command ! ! " I wish I could describe her 
look at this reply ! She tore a leaf from her diary, and remark 
ing that she was " at home " every afternoon after five, handed 
me her address, and bowed herself from my quarters.

CAPT. CAMP MAJOR SHERBURN MARCHING ORDERS RESIG 
NATIONS 4TH OF JULY MARCHING ORDERS AGAIN OFF 

AT LAST AN ACCIDENTAL DEATH RUN TO "SANDY 

HOOK" MARYLAND HEIGHTS NEWLY BRIGADED 

WASTE OF PROPERTY AT EVACUATION OF 

POSITION OUR GOOD NAME TARNISHED. 

Capt. Camp, in charge of the railroad station, writes us thus : 
" I must insist upon your not relieving the guard at this 
station. For the two years I have had charge of it, I have 
never had duty performed so satisfactorily." He refused to 
allow the guard on duty, to be relieved by the new detail ; and 
has suceeded in procuring an order from General Headquarters, 
directing " the party, now on duty, to remain as permanent 
guard." His success has induced Capt. Meigs, at the old 
Capitol Prison, to prefer the same request. 

Maj. Sherburn, our inspector of the 18th, reports in writing, 
as follows ; 

" This Regiment is in the very best condition, as regards 
"drill and discipline; its quarters perfectly neat ; its hos- 
"pital arrangements perfect ; and it has never been my lot to 
" inspect a regiment, whose arms and equipments were in such 
" splendid order." 

Are n t we justified in feeling proud ? when it is remembered 
that not one moment of time was spent in preparing for this 
inspection, save such as was required to " pack knapsacks." 

Capt. Leach, returned from "absence with leave" and 
reported for duty to-day. 



110 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 



u The 34th Regiment, Massachusetts Voimteers, will 
hold itself in readiness to move at a moment s notice." Such is 
the order which reached us this evening; and we are only 
waiting the relief of our various guards. This work goes on 
slowly and slovenly ; being done by the employees of the Quar 
termaster s department, who, as report goes, are organized, 
equipped, and well drilled ; ready to do duty as soldiers, in case 
of need. Judge how well founded this claim, in their behalf, 
is, by the following : A squad of these fellows, under command 
of a Captain, was marched up to relieve a guard on duty, 
and received the following orders : " lialt" "front" " Order 
arms." There being some delay in the execution of this last 
order, the commanding officer broke out in this most approved 
military fashion? "Lay your guns down on the ground, d n 
your souls ! !" 

21th. Our order to be ready to move, is countermanded, and 
we have resumed duty as before. I have been up to the Old 
Capitol Prison, to look at some five hundred rebel prisoners, 
who, under guard of two companies of ours, are to be trans 
ported to Fortress Monroe. In physique, these men are every 
thing one would desire for soldiers ; and, except for clothing, 
need shun comparison with no body of men in the service ; 
"Though, to be sure," as our Adjutant remarked, " They 
have n t each got two pairs of white gloves, and a stock in his 
knapsack." 

28th. 10 P. M. Again an order to hold ourselves in readi 
ness to move. 

29th. Still here ; though ready to fall in, at the first tap of 
the drum. A rebel force is raiding between here and Balti 
more. The 39th Massachusetts moved last night to Fort 
Alexander ; and the 14th New Hampshire to Fort Massachu 
setts. Hooker is relieved, and Meade ordered to the command 
thus vacated. My boy, Jim, has just laid upon my table an 
immense bouquet. " Why, Jim? where did you get that?" 
" Well, Colonel," said he, touching his cap, "that ar was confis- 
ticated from a yallar gal, what has just seceded ! " 

30A. To-day was Bi-monthly Inspection and muster for pay. 
The resignation of the Chaplain has been accepted. We lose, 



WASHINGTON. Ill 

also, to the great regret of every person in the command, Capt. 
Cooley ; his health being such as to forbid his remaining in the 
service. 

July %d. We are ordered to report at 9 A. M., to-morrow, in 
front of the City Hall, to form part of the escort in the 
municipal celebration of the day. 

July 5th. Our work of yesterday, escort to the procession 
in the municipal celebration of the day, was fatiguing enough. 
The weather was intensely hot, and some of the boys were 
sun-struck. We moved on to line, at the City Hall, at 9 
A. M. All our details for guard, except one relief at each 
station, were called in, and thus increased, our regiment out 
numbered, by double, any other command on duty. We were 
greeted with cheers at several points in the line of march. 
The day s duty was closed by a " march in review," before 
Gens. Martindale s and Heiiitzleman s Headquarters; officers 
from the staff of each of whom have ridden out to-day to 
compliment us upon our "splendid appearance," and as they 
are pleased to say, u our triumph over all other regiments on 
duty." We are accused of having had our arms silver-plated, 
and more than one bet was won and lost on this point. 

Fatiguing as the service was, it was not without its amusing 
incident. On our homeward march the Colonel was desirous 
of showing us off to a bevy of ladies, chief of whom was Miss 
U , with whom he had made an intimate acquaintance. So he 
despatched the Adjutant along the line to put us on our good 
behaviour. Arms were brought to the shoulder, and in column 
of companies, to the inspiring notes of " the Girl I left behind 
Me," he led us by her residence, ignorant of the appearance 
he himself made, as with pants slipped above his knees, thus 
disclosing the bright scarlet of his close fitting drawers, he 
proudly reined his prancing bay charger before the eyes of the 
lady of his love. 

At our evening parade the whole square was densely 
packed. Officers, citizens, ladies on foot, on horseback, and 
in carriages, so filled the avenue that the boys had to wait on 
line some time after the parade was dismissed to allow the 
crowd to disperse. 



112 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Sth. At the request of Hon. B. B. French, our band was 
allowed to go out last evening, to serenade the occupants of 
the " White House," and this morning s papers speak of the 
performance "by the Matchless Band, of the 34th Massachu 
setts, Col. Peck." Such is fame ! Capts. Fox and Pratt, and 
Lieut. Lovell, made their appearance to-day, much to our joy, 
for we are very hard worked. 

Qch. The afternoon and evening have been full of excite 
ment. Soon after dinner, the Col. who had left camp in the 
morning, returned in haste, and exchanging his uniform for 
citizen s dress, left camp without communicating with any one. 
In phrase familiar among us, the Judge was absent, the Col. at 
home. 

About 4 P. M., Capt. Potter A. A. A. G. Headquarters De 
fences, dashed up, and in an excited tone and manner, demanded 
" wliy the regiment was not under arms." Simply Capt. was 
the reply, " because we do not move without orders ! " " But 
your orders were issued long ago ! " " That may be so, Capt., 
but none have been received." " Where is Col. Wells? " " He 
was here a short time ago, Capt." was the reply, and the orderly 
was directed to look for him, and say to him, that Capt. P. 
desired to see him. The Capt. however with, " well Col.," call 
in your guards, pack your knapsacks, and get ready to move at 
once, put spurs to his horse and rode off. All guards, with 
the exception of those over the state prisons, were at once 
ordered to camp, and the hospital and Quartermaster s 
department put in readiness to move, the latter by the 
efficiency of the Quartermaster Sergeant, as the Quartermaster 
himself was absent. We were resting thus, when an aide de 
camp of Gen. Martindale dashed up, his horse all in a foam, 
with an inquiry for Col. Wells, and learning his absence, for 
Col. L. Upon the latter presenting himself, he received an 
order to "move the command." "What Capt. as it is? 1 
have nt half the regiment with me ! " " You have had ample 
time Col I Why are you not ready? " 

" You were ordered to call in your guards, long ago, Colonel! 
Why did you not obey? " " I could not imagine, Captain, that 
it was intended that I should take the guards from the govern- 



WASHINGTON. 113 

ment prisons, and leave the rebels there unguarded ! All my 
other guards were called in, and are ready to move now." 
"But, are you not relieved at the prisons? "No, sir! " and 
off he dashed. 

That no possible blame should attach to the Regiment, all 
guards, not on actual post at the prisons, were ordered into 
quarters, to pack knapsacks ; and this done, the sentinels on 
duty were relieved for the same purpose ; and the whole guard 
were at their posts, ready to join the command as it should 
move on its way. Messengers were despatched in all quar 
ters for the missing Colonel and Quartermaster. Now, at near 9 
P. M., Capt. Potter again galloped up, and angrily demanded to 
know " why we were not under arms. By G-d ! Colonel, we 
have looked upon yours as the best regiment ever on duty in 
this city ; but this is inexcusable ! " The storm of abuse, 
which was breaking over my head, was suspended by the arrival 
of an Orderly, with written orders, which he handed me. 
They proved to be the ones which had been issued hours before ; 
and the lightning flashed at the orderly instead of at me. 

" Still, said the Captain in more civil tone, " Still, I cannot 
understand why you are not ready to move I " "I am ready to 
move this moment Captain, if directed, and " Get your 
men under arms at once, Colonel ! " was his order. How our 
bugles rarfg out their " call to the color," in the hope that in 
the stillness of the summer air, our missing officers would hear, 
and hearing, recognize them ! Our line showed small, as it was 
formed. " Where is your regiment, Colonel?" broke from the 
Captain, as saluting, I reported it ready. " It is a strong one ; 
and yet you muster here, not more than two or three hundred 
men." " Captain, every man, subject to my orders, stands in 
line ! It is not our fault that other men, detailed by Superior 
Headquarters, are not present." " But you reported yourself 
as ready to move ! " " True, sir ; and I am ready." " Where 
are your details, Colonel ? " " At the Government prisons, 
Captain." " Why are they not relieved ? " c I wish I could 
tell you, Captain. They have orders to come in as soon as 
relieved, and I have no doubt they will do so." 

The Capt. sat his horse for a few moments; his low mutter- 



114 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

ing indicating, pretty plainly that some one would catch it. 
But his patience gave way before long, and, in response to his 
sharp command, the order to march was issued. As we drew 
near the prisons, we were directed to " halt." The work of 
relieving our guard was going on, with all the slow awkward 
ness so peculiar to the employees of the Quartermaster s 
Department. This accomplished, the men fell into line, and, 
to the inspiring music of our band, beneath the light of a 
nearly full moon, we marched through deserted streets, to the 
railroad station, where a train of cars was in waiting for us. 
Here our Col. joined us. 

It was past eleven P. M., when the long train of cars moved 
out from the station, in the direction of Baltimore. We left 
behind Lieut. Elwell, charged with the proper disposition of 
our own and the Government property, and first Asst. Surgeon 
Thorndike in charge of the hospital, its sick and supplies. The 
Relay House was not reached till after sunrise the next morn 
ing, and our stay there was long. At length we started ; our 
running was slow. Many of the men had clambered upon the 
roofs of the box cars, there being no provision made for them 
to sit down inside. As we neared Ellicott s Mills, we were all 
startled by a cry that a man had fallen from the train. It was 
Fitzgerald, one of F s best men. His body, horribly mangled, 
was left in charge of a brother soldier from his owii company, 
who was directed to see to its proper burial ; and, saddened by 
the occurrence, our route was resumed. It was evening when 
we reached Frederic Junction. Crossing the Monocacy on a 
frail wooden bridge, in place of the splendid iron one destroyed 
by the rebels last December, and rolling along through a most 
lovely valley, the train came to a stand at " Sandy Hook," 
about 9 P. M. Disembarking, the regiment threaded its way 
through almost countless trains of cars, and army wagons. 
Thick, heavy clouds obscured the moon, and, in almost Egyp 
tian darkness, we felt our way. Our route lay along a narrow 
road between the canal, on our left, and Maryland Heights, 
which towered to a great height, on our right. In the darkness 
one man fell into the canal, but was rescued with the loss of 
his musket only. 



WASHINGTON. 115 

It was past two o clock when, having reached a plateau 
midway up the "mountain, we laid down, as we were halted, 
for the sleep and rest we needed, 

Upon trains close following our own, were the 39th Massa 
chusetts, a Pennsylvania regiment of heavy Artillery, and two 
light batteries, the whole under the temporary command of 
Col. Wells. Our bugles roused us early on the morning of the 
12th, and soon afterwards, Cols. Sprague and Studley, Lieut. 
Harkness, and others of the 51st Massachusetts, gave us a warm 
and pleasant greeting. 

We were tired and hungry. Foraging parties soon unearthed 
from beneath wood piles, and other places of concealment, near 
the few farm houses in sight, boxes of hard tack, and barrels 
of pork, which there was little hesitancy in pronouncing 
u contraband." Our " shelters " are pitched upon a little trian 
gular plot of clear ground, some two hundred feet from the 
river side of the mountain. To the east, rise the Heights 
proper, now held by six regiments of Infantry, and two 
batteries of Artillery. To the west, is " Fort Duncan," gar 
risoned by our own 46th; a part of the 51st lying in support. 
On the opposite side of the river rise London and Bolivar 
heights, between which, are the ruined villages of " Harper s 
Ferry," and " Bolivar," HOAV held by Rebel forces. Lee has 
escaped, and with these others, we are sent up here to lock the 
stable. By orders of Gen. Negley in command, the 34th and 
39th Massachusetts, the 173d Pennsylvania, with a squadron 
of Michigan, and another of Pennsylvania cavalry, are brigaded 
under Col. Wells. 

The 39th has been detached, and with the 8th, 46th, and 
51st, Massachusetts, the whole under command of Brig. Gen. 
H. S. Briggs, marched last night, en route for Boonsboro, and 
the " Army of the Potomac." 

What a frightful waste of property attended the evacuation 
of this position! Dried apples, hard tack, rice and sugar, all 
mixed and jumbled together, lay in heaps, from two to three 
feet deep, and this, although the Rebels have drawn away 
large quantities, and all the farmers from the near country, 
have take away large supply for present and future wants. 



116 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Piles of Sibley tents, as good as new, save that each has been 
slit once from top to bottom, arid heaps of Springfield muskets, 
many of them with broken stocks indeed, but many entirely 
uninjured, and for which our boys have left their own, in 
exchange, lie scattered about. One huge one hundred pound 
rifled Parrott gun lies on the mountain side, down which, after 
being dismounted, it was hurriedly thrown. Everything shows 
a hurried, and ill considered, and ill planned evacuation ; 
between which, and its re-occupation, it is said, just four days 
elapsed. All told, we number six hundred and fifty men 
present for duty. Two companies are on picket, and two 
others support the garrison at fort Duncan. Every able bodied 
man of ours is on fatigue, to-day, engaged in drawing up to 
fort Duncan two thirty-two pound pieces. 

14/i. For the first time the fair fame of the regiment is 
tarnished. Two Sergeants, C. of " C," and Mel. of " G," 
passed our picket line to-day, and shot, dressed, and cut up, a 
bull belonging to a farmer near by ; leaving the meat to be 
brought in after dark. Strange taste which makes bull beef 
stolen, sweeter than Uncle Sam s rations regularly issued! 
Complaint was made at Headquarters, investigation followed 
the guilty were placed in arrest, and all are waiting the close 
of proceedings. 

Rebel-working parties are visible in Harper s Ferry, attempt 
ing to throw a bridge across the Shenandoah. They are 
covered from fire, from this side, by females, or males dressed 
in female apparel. 



CHAPTER XIII. 



HARPER S FERRY. 

CROSSING OF THE POTOMAC OCCUPATION OF HARPER S FERRY 
CHANGE OF CAMP - " WHO KILLED THE BULL" 
DETAILS OF OFFICERS - A MERRY EVENING - OUR 
OFFICERS TRANSFERRED POST GENERAL 

ORDER -- TRANSFERRED AGAIN. 



In the early morning, an order was received, to 
" detail one hundred picked men, as sharp shooters, without 
rations, in light marching order, ready to move at a moment s 
notice." This was superseded, almost instantly, by one for the 
entire regiment to be got ready to move, in similar order. 

Without delay, we descended the heights, crossed the canal, 
and drew up on the river-side, partially covered by the trees 
upon its banks. 

^ Pontoon " boats floated in the waters of the canal, in charge 
of a party of the engineer corps, and "scows" near by, indi 
cated that a crossing was to be attempted. Gen. Negley, in 
person, superintended the operation. The Potomac was to be 
crossed from two starting points. F company on one boat, 
with Col. Wells, A. P&gt;. G., from the ford proper, and B 
company on another, with Lieut. Col. Lincoln, commanding 
the regiment, from a point lower down, preceded slightly by 
picked men from E and I companies, under command of Capts. 
Bacon and Solev, and Lieuts. Lincoln and Cobb, and closely 
followed by the remaining companies of the regiment pushed 
out. The 17th Indiana battery, Capt, Miner, shelled the 
opposite shore, from which, concealed in the brush which 
covered London Heights, and half hidden in the ruined birild- 
10 



118 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

ings of Harper s Ferry, Rebel skirmishers poured an annoying 
but harmless fire. 

The crossing was quickly effected, and the breast works on 
" Camp Hill " occupied without delay. A few prisoners were 
taken. The pontoon bridge was speedily laid ; a squadron of 
Connecticut Cavalry crossed, and was pushed forward in pur 
suit of the enemy ; Company " D," Capt. Thompson, following 
in support. The rebels, slowly retiring beyond " Bolivar," 
were sharply engaged at Halltown by Maj. Farnum, who was 
taken prisoner, but whose party, in turn, captured a Col., one 
Capt., one Lieut, and two privates of the 12th Va. Cavalry. 

At 11 P. M. our wagons came up, bringing the first morsel 
of provisions we had had since breakfast ; and after eating, we 
laid down with neither shelter or covering. 

16/i. Chaos reigns supreme ; our order of encampment hav 
ing been changed three times since our crossing, at the whim 
of the General commanding. Just now, our line faces the 
Shenandoah, stretching along the spur which divides the waters 
of that river from those of the Potomac. At the extreme right 
are two pieces (rifled six pounders) of the battery which covered 
our crossing; next our right wing; then two more pieces of 
artillery ; then our left wing, which is also flanked by two, the 
remaining pieces of this battery. Regimental Headquarters are 
to the rear of the color company, behind which lie s in bivouac 
Col. Curtis with two squadrons of the 1st Massachusetts cavalry. 
u Gregg s " Division of Cavalry, about 5000 strong, lies about 
a mile to our right front. 

16/i to 20th. We have moved, and now lie behind the 
breastworks on Camp Hill, so called. Miner s battery, is on our 
riaiit, and the line of defence extends from the cliffs 011 the 

o 

banks of the Potomac, to the Shenandoah on the left. 

We have used the strong arm, and have seized and now 
occupy for a hospital the wooden Church in Bolivar, just 
below and in front of the earthworks which constitute the 
only line of defences for this place. 

The " Army of the Potomac " is again in motion ; Buford s 
division of cavalry crossing the Potomac yesterday, at Berlin," 
and the 12th corps, lying in bivouac, last night, on the road, 
opposite us, at the foot of Maryland Heights. 



HAKPEll s FEKKY. 119 

Yesterday, the twenty-five dollars assessed upon companies C 
and G for the value of the bull killed by two of the Sergeants 
of those companies, while AVC were upon Maryland Heights, 
were paid to the owner of the animal. So Avas secured indemni 
fication for the past ; Regimental General Orders of the day, 
reduce to the ranks the offending non-commissioned officers, 
which guarantees the future. 

Ours is the only Infantry force this side of the river, and 
all approaches to the place are held by pickets from our 
command, with the most strict orders to allow no communi 
cation with the post, on the part of any persons, beyond the 
lines. One of our officers on duty at the Shenandoah crossing, 
is so strict a constructionist that he refused to permit the 
passage of market men of London county, upon whom the 
citizens of the place are dependent for their daily supplies ; 
and the consequence is that there are no dinners in the village, 
to-day. 

Capt. Potter of "B" is appointed Provost Marshal of the 
post, one company acting as provost guard. Lieut. Kipley is 
placed as A. A. I). C., and Adj t Woods A. A. A. G. on 
Brigade staff. For the only time in our service, the Col. has 
held council with his officers as to our position; Gen. Sickles 
having expressed a desire to secure the regiment in his Division, 
and having offered our Col. the command of a Brigade. We 
unanimously advised an acceptance of the offer, but the Col. 
refused it, and so we stay here. 

Gen. Negley is relieved, and Gen. Lockwood, of the 
"Potomac Home Brigade," a body of brave men, "who will fight 
to the death, if the Rebels invade Maryland" but who decline 
to " cross the river to prevent such invasion" is appointed to the 
command of this place. 

Our Sutler, now, eight days since our departure from 
Washington, came up to-day, bringing as supplies precisely 
one hundred papers u line cut," and one half box "navy 
tobacco," one gross matches, six phials of oil, and one half 
dozen sheets of emery cloth. Liberal supply, indeed, for the 
wants of six hundred men ! Capt. Fox left us yesterday, on 
sick leave, for hospital in Washington. 



120 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 



Our brigade is united again, the 173d Pennsylvania 
and the remaining squadron of cavalry having crossed the river 
yesterday, making our garrison 1767. Gen. Gregg having 
moved his command last night, the two remaining squadrons 
of cavalry, supported by two companies of infantry, picket our 
front, the Rebels being within one-quarter of a mile of our 
advanced posts ; Ewell, with his corps, lying only eight miles 
distant from us. Gen. Lockwood, leaving his home brigade in 
safe quarters, on "the Heights," has in person crossed the river 
and taken his quarters in one of the abandoned houses on 
" Camp Hill." 

23d. The Quartermaster s stores, which day before yesterday 
were moved to this place, are now being moved back to 
" Sandy Hook," and .with them have gone the persons of the 
commanding General and staff. 

A reconnoitering party, Capt. Bacon commanding, marched 
into London yesterday, but without any definite result, beyond 
discovering an encampment of three Rebel regiments. 

Yesterday, for the first time since leaving Upton s Hill, the 
regiment was out on battalion drill, to-day on skirmish drill. 

Our evening has passed right merrily. Just before tattoo, 
Dr. Clark escorted to Regimental Headquarters, which are 
in an abandoned house, without door or window, and with no 
flooring, except on the second story, a bevy of ladies, young, 
but, ah me ! not fair ! All chairs we had were occupied, and 
temporary seats were made of trunks, and valises turned on 
end. The Ladies sang patriotic songs. The Band was called 
upon for its choicest airs, and to crown all, the boys roared 
out their army glees! all went merrily ! Additional interest 
was given to the affair, by the presence in the party of Miss 
- , a young lady from Bolivar, who, at the occupation of the 
village by the Rebels, in answer to their demand upon her to 
haul down and surrender the national flag flying from her 
father s house, wrapped it round her person, and, pistol in hand, 
bade them " come and take it." 

Two companies, "C" and " E," A. D; Pratt commanding, in 
answer to orders, garrisoned three "monitor cars," each armed 
with two howitzers, and loop holed for musketry, for a trip to 



HARPER S FERRY. 121 

the front, on the Winchester Railroad. The condition of the 
road was such as to render an advance impossible, and after 
proceeding about three miles, the expedition was abandoned. 

The 173d Pennsylvania, a nine months organization of draft, 
ed men, has left for home and muster out. In its place the 9th 
and 10th Maryland, six months troops, are added to the Brigade; 
but they are across the river and prefer Maryland soil. 

The sentence of Lieut. Stiles, "dishonorable dismissal from 
the service," is to-day promulgated to the Regiment. 

Lieut. Smith, in arrest and turned over to the "Provost 
Guard " at Washington at our hurried departure from the Capi 
tol, has been permitted to resign, although under charges, and 
has been Iwnordbly discharged. 

Lieut. Butler is under arrest again ; this time for abandoning 
his post as Officer of the Guard. He sent in his resignation, 
which has been forwarded "approved." 

We are transferred again; this time from the Department 
under command of Gen. Couch to the " Middle Military Depart 
ment under Gen. Sphenck. Maj. Pratt and Lieut. Horton start 
to-day for home, on fifteen days * leave. 

August 3rd, Sunday. Post General Order forbids the moving 
of Government trains on Sundays. " What s to be done ?" asks 
the Commissary ; "we ve no bread ! " 

It s " root hog, or die." Trains to be used in spite of the 
order, or the Boys to go hungry ! So the trains were ordered 
to " Sandy Hook " for rations ; and Capt. Blakely of the Cav 
alry, being without forage, took courage from our action, and 
despatched his wagons for hay. 

6th. We are transferred again; this time to "the Army of 
Observation, Mountain Department," Major-Gen. Kelley com 
manding; Headquarters at Cumberland. The same command 
formerly held by Banks and Fremont. 



CHAPTER XIV. 



THE 9TH MARYLAND RECORDS OF COURTS MARTIAL, ETC. - 
TABLEAUX IN " E " REASONABLE REQUESTS UNPLEAS 
ANTNESS AT DIVISION HEADQUARTERS A BUSY 
NIGHT A STORM ON THE PICKET LINE OUR 
WORK CHARLESTOWN RECRUITING. 

The 9th Maryland, Col. Simpson, have so far overcome their 
scruples as to cross the river to-day for the purpose of being 
reviewed and drilled by the "Born Chieftain," as Gen. Lock- 
wood is called by his staff. Well! well ! well! such a sight, and 
such work! ! ! The officers were gotten up as lady killers ! Such 
length of sashes! such breadth of belts; such gorgeous shoulder 
straps ! On the part of the men, such slouching appearance ! 
such disregard of time and step in marching ! such entire want 
of even the look of soldiers ! Going down the line, the General 
came to one of the men leaning on his musket in an attitude of 
heavy loafing, and thus addressed him: "My dear man! do 
you know that if you allow yourself to indulge in such an 
attitude you will never make a soldier?" "Have nt I got the 
order to rest? and don t I know how to take it easy?" was 
the answering question. 

7th. Sent down through the regular channels, came to-day, 
a large bundle of orders, mostly records of courts martial ; 
which, after being read at Headquarters, it is ordered, shall not 
be read at the head of the Regiment, as is customary. What a 
mess our soft-hearted President makes, in the exercise of his 
pardoning power ! Deserters, sentenced to be shot, have the 
sentence commuted to " loss of two months pay!" Spies, 
convicted and sentenced to be huny, in one instance, now of 
record before me, have the sentence disapproved, and commuted 



HARPER S FERRY. 123 

to " being sent through our lines ! " Drunken Officers, cashiered 
by vote of brother officers, get remanded to duty by their tender 
hearted Commander-in-Chief ! Officially to promulgate such 
action, at the head of a Regiment, is to destroy all discipline ! 

This matter of discipline is delicate in the extreme. To 
illustrate : By Post General order, it is forbidden to any 
soldier to cross the Shenandoah River. Yet yesterday, 
three of our men forged the name of the Lieut. Colonel com 
manding, to a pass allowing them to cross the river ; and this 
morning the officer who recognized the pass, is in arrest by 
order of the Post Commander; and the men who committed the 
forgery, in our Guard House, under charges preferred by the 
Captain of their Company. The mail has brought for one of 
these men, a commission in the line of the State of New Jersey, 
and an appointment on the staff of his brother, the General ; 
and his Captain now prefers a request to be allowed to with 
draw the charge against this man, based upon the statement that 
the " forgery was committed in a frolic ;" and that the " princi- 
" pal offender now holds a commission, and should not, therefore, 
"be longer detained in the Guard House." This request has 
been returned refused ; with the endorsement, that the forgery 
was no less a serious offence that it was committed in a frolic, 
as evidence of which, is the arrest of the officer who regarded 
it ; and also, that the man, although he holds in his hands a 
commission, and appointment to staff duty, is still a member of 
the 34th; undischarged, and, of course, amenable to our 
discipline. 

Just look at this tableau in Company E ! 

Two men are playing checkers, with corn and beans, upon a 
board chalked out on the floor of the piazza to Headquarters ; 
near by, four others, seated on boards supported on bricks 
placed on end, are playing euchre, with a drum head for table ; 
to the left stands a man with a dirty rag in his pocket, a piece 
of hard soap in one hand, and brush in the other, ready to shave 
his customer, who, with legs wide apart, and head thrown back, 
stands leaning against a tree. 

Sth. The day has passed with but little of incident. 

Two damsels, who desired to " search the camp for a couple 



124 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

u of saddle horses" they had lost, presented themselves at 
Headquarters early in the forenoon ; but, inasmuch as they 
declined the escort of an officer, their request was refused. 
With an air of triumph they soon re-appeared, presenting an 
order from the Acting Brigadier, allowing them to go through 
the camp, unaccompanied. Notwithstanding the order, a Ser 
geant of the Guard was directed to attend them. The animals 
were not found, however. A lady from " Bolivar " soon after 
made a call, preferring a request that " our Sergeant of Patrol 
"might be directed to call at her house, and whip one of her 
negroes," too big for her to handle. And, later in the day, a man 
from the same village, who exhibited permission from the Post 
Commander to " give an evening entertainment for the benefit 
" of a newly wedded pair, provided the party should be con- 
" ducted in an orderly manner," made his appearance, and 
preferred his request that he might be furnished with a guard 
from the Regiment, to secure the quiet of the assembly. 

12th. A little unpleasantness occurred to-day at Division 
Headquarters, which is of interest mainly as some of our men 
were concerned. 

It, was necessary, yesterday, that some writing should be done 
at an unusually early hour. For some cause the clerks were 
not within call. So, Boone, the A. A. G. stormed ; and with 
Massey, A. A. D. C., reported to the "Born Chieftain" the in_ 
dignity. Orders were thereupon issued that "thenceforward 
the orderly should call the roll of the clerks each morning at 6 
A. M." So this morning the roll was duly called; but no clerks 
responded, and report thereof was made. " Send them to the 
Guard House ! " thundered the General, which was done ; and 
the staff officers sat down to perform the duties for which the 
clerks had been detailed. Orders were at once forwarded to 
the Regiment to detail other men competent to act as clerks. 
Report was made that "all such were already detailed." In this 
dilemma a council was called, and after deliberation the offend 
ing clerks were summoned before the General, who, expatiating 
upon the pleasures incident to the position they filled, and com 
menting upon the enormity of the offence, gave them the option 
of remaining at his headquarters in the enjoyment of the attend- 



Jk 
HAlM Elfs FERRY. 125 

ing blessings, coupled with that one of attending morning roll call 
daily at 6 A. M., or of being returned to their Companies. 
To the consternation of the General and his staff, who were 
utterly unable to understand such perversity, the clerks chose 
to be returned to their Companies, where they now are. Mean 
while, there is an agreeable lull in the shower of orders which 
has been pouring upon the Regiment. 

Many of our men are having their wives come out, and for 
their accommodation the military arm has been used to dispos 
sess some others, temporary residents of the tenements they 
occupy ; after all, with no more right than our own men. 

15th. We have had a busy night. A scare at headquarters 
led to the issue of orders about 10 o clock p. M., directing two 
companies to report, at once, to the officer of the day. The 
force marched in exactly six minutes from the time the order 
reached headquarters. A second order for a large detail to 
strengthen the Provost Guard was soon afterwards received ; 
and yet again another directing a reinforcement of a full 
company to the Picket on the left flank. 

Ours is still the only Infantry Regiment at this Post, and we 
are worked to death. It has more than once happened that at 
night, officers are ordered out for a twenty-four hours service, 
who, in the morning of the same day, were relieved from a term 
of duty of equal length. 

There has been a storm on the picket line, but fortunately 
without injury to anyone. Gen. Lockwood, unaccompanied, 
dressed in citizen s pants, with an army blouse, and his head 
covered with an old palm leaf hat, rode up, attempting to pass 
the line. His demand to be allowed to ride to the front was 
refused by the sentinel, and an orderly was despatched with 
orders to Col. Wells, in command of the Post, to report at once. 
Upon reaching the ground, the General read him a lecture upon 
what he was pleased to term " the insubordination of the senti 
nel." At this stage the commanding officer of the Regiment 
was ordered also to the ground, and the lecture was transferred 
to him. " But, General, your own orders are that no one is to 
be allowed to go to the front unless he presents a pass from the 
Provost Marshal." "Yes, Col.; but I announced my name and 



126 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

rank." "Anybody might have done the same, General; and 
how was the sentinel to know you, being without uniform, 
mark of rank, or the least thing to confirm your statement?" 
The matter terminated by an assurance from the General that 
he had simply desired to test the fidelity of the sentinel, who, he 
was pleased to find, knew his duty. We are equally well pleased. 

Capt. Leach, with Companies "A" and "G" was ordered to 
the banks of the Shenandoah, to resist an attempt at crossing by 
a guerilla force, which has been hovering round us for a few 
days past. 

Captain Bacon, with his squad, who had crossed into Loudon 
to arrest some parties there, returned, bringing with him four 
prisoners. 

Yesterday was the anniversary of our leaving Worcester; and 
the officers of the left wing, in order that it might not pass 
entirely without notice, invited their brothers of the right wing 
to a little entertainment, which consisted mainly in treating such 
as they could catch unawares, to a good, healthy tossing in a 
blanket. 

20th. We hold this place, aided by a Battery of six pieces, 
and about one hundred and fifty Cavalry, where the garrison 
formerly has varied from four to thirteen thousand men. 
Mark how we are worked! Company "F" has but six men 
not on duty ; "H " has but ten ; " D," twenty, and "A," " G " 
and " E " were ordered out last night and are still absent. There 
are now in camp one hundred and thirty-eight men and four 
officers only, who have not been on duty the past twenty-four 
hours. Capt. Fox returned to-day from his leave of absence. 

21s. The d 1 has been to pay since yesterday, when the 

Regiment was paid off. As a whole our boys are splendid 
fellows. A few of them will get drunk when they can, but the 
most of them are, at all times, unexceptionable in their behavior. 
Three of " FV men threatened the life of their Captain, last 
night. They are coming to their senses in the Guard House. 
Another man struck the Officer of the Guard a very severe blow, 
and he is admiring the looks of iron bracelets upon his wrists. 

26th. We have been adding to the otherwise good appearance 
of our camp. Bowers of evergreen cover each company s street, 
giving comfort to the men, as well as beauty to the camp. 



HARPER S FERRY. 127 

" The King of France, with 40,000 men, 

" Marched up the hill, ami then, marched down again." 

And almost the same performance was required of us yesterday. 
In pursuance of orders received late in the evening of the 24th, 
five companies of the Regiment u C, ? Lieut. Cobb, "D," Capt. 
Thompson, " E," Lieut. Horton, " H," Capt. Fox, and " I," 
Lieut. Lincoln, the whole under the Lieut. Col., marched on to 
line at 4 A. M., of the 25th, and almost immediately left for 
Charlestown, under orders to report to Col. Simpson of the 9th 
Maryland, who was stationed with his command, about four 
hundred strong, in that place. Capt. Bacon of " E," Pratt of 
"G," and Soley of "I," were on special duty for the time being. 
Our march was undisturbed ; although, but the day previous, a 
wagon train on its way to that place had been attacked and 
compelled to return. We came unchallenged upon the pickets 
of the 9th, stationed about half a mile outside the village ; and 
narrowly escaped receiving their fire. That .Regiment itself was 
drawn up hastily and confusedly in front of the Court House, as 
we were mar died by. Our route through the village took us by 
the Court House in which John Brown was tried, and which 
the 9th now occupied as barracks, to the cupola of which a 
Union Soldier was lashing a flag-staff, from which already the 
Stars and Stripes were floating ; past the jail in which the old 
hero was confined, now used as a stable for the horses of a small 
squad of Cavalry ; and in plain sight of the spot on which was 
erected the gallows, from which the soul of the martyr went 
inarching on. Passing on, we drew up on a beautiful estate, 
occupied by a Mr. Ransom. At the order to halt, all windows 
were shut, all blinds drawn to, and doors violently slammed and 
bolted. Mr. R. himself seemed in an unhappy state of mind, at 
what he termed " an unholy violation of his privacy ; " actually 
refusing to allow the boys to draw water from his well, but will 
ing enough to sell them milk at sixteen cents the quart. " He 
" was a gentleman ! he was ! " " The ladies of his family were 
"delicate and refined! they were! " "His family were in deep 
"grief, on account of the recent death of a loved member! 
"And, oh dear ! what shall we do." " Why, my dear sir, what 
" is the matter? v " My dear little grandson is fretting at being 



128 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" deprived of his daily walk ! " " Well, why don t you let him 
" walk, if he wants to?" 

" His dear mother can t trust him alone ! and she can t 
come out of the house this morning!" "Why not, sir? what 
prevents ? " " Why Col., you must know that no Southern 
lady can venture among your Northern soldiers, rough and 
rude as they are ! " " Not even to spit upon the bodies of the 
dead and dying, who have laid on the streets of your village 
sir ? " was the inquiry. * 

Of course the day was monotonous. The officers, seeking 
relief from the sun, gathered under the trees near the house 
and resorted to the inevitable pipe and cards, to while away the 
hours; some few streched themselves upon the floor of the 
piazza, and courted sleep. 

Suddenly, loud groans disturbed us, and our friend was seen 
wringing his hands, and giving other unmistakable signs of 
inward disturbance. 

" I fear you are seriously ill, sir," was the remark ! " Oh no ! 
not that ! but look at those soldiers ! what could tempt them to 
invade that garden ? See ! there is one now, just taking hold 
of that rose-bush ! How can he do it? Why is it permitted? " 
It was true, some of the boys were in the garden, but they were 
walking in the paths, occasionally stooping to examine and 
enjoy the flowering shrubs and plants, which made the place 
so beautiful, but not even breaking one blossom from its stem. 
No order was issued to disturb their enjoyment. So passed the 
time, till late in the afternoon, when Col. Wells and staff rode 
up, and, in response to orders, we retraced our steps, reaching 
camp about 7 P. M. 

28th. Our rolls show our strength to be eight hundred and 
fifty-four, and of this number at least one hundred and fifty 
men are unfit for active service. After a long trial, we have 
succeeded in obtaining leave to send home a recruiting party, 
and Lieut. Elwell starts to-day for Massachusetts, with ten 
men, to try and fill up our ranks. Each company contributes, 
from its " savings " fund, twenty dollars, toward the incidental 
expenses of the party. 

* In allusion to an occurrence which actually happened. 



CHAPTER XV. 



REVIEW ALARMS SICK INSPECTION OF CAMP, &C. COM 
MISSIONS A RAMPAGE BRIGADE DRFLLS A NON 
COMMISSIONED RECRUIT AN ALARM. 

Sept 2d. The various commands were reviewed yesterday, 
preliminary to being mustered for pay. The 34th was simply 
perfect; the 10th Maryland, Maj. Pratt of ours, inspecting 
officer, was so, so ; the batteries, inspected by the Acting- 
Brigadier, were in fair condition ; and the Cavalry, well, bad is 
no word to use, in describing their condition. Their appearance 
justified the remark of our Adjutant, A. A. A. G. on the 
brigade staff, that the " only two persons, in the command, who 
were in uniform, were the Captain and Lieutenant, and they 
were in shirt sleeves." 

Leave was granted to such of our officers as were off duty, 
to ride out to Charlestown, to witness the ceremony of a flag 
presentation to the 9th Maryland. Spear of I, a private, who 
has been on the sick list for weeks, walked the distance out and 
back, and at his return was marched on to duty. Sergeants 
Dempsey of B, and Walker of H, promoted to Lieutenants, 
were mustered in as officers. 

The last few days have been hard upon us. Alarms, 
given from Charlestown, led to the hurried march of one wing, 
Major Pratt commanding, to that place ; and during their 
absence to the movement of three companies to " London " and 
" Snicker s gap." Lieut. Lincoln is on leave of absence ; Capt. 
Willard goes to-day on sick leave ; Lieut. R. W. Walker is 
reported absent without leave, having overstayed his time. A 
large party of Virginians, claiming to be Union men, came into 
the post yesterday, to avoid, as they said, a Rebel conscripting 
party, which was scouring Jefferson County. 



130 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

6th. Our sick list is increasing again rapidly. In answer to 
a note from Headquarters requiring explanation of his absence 
from this morning s roll call, Lieut. Hall writes " that of the 
past thirteen nights he had been on duty si* ; that he was on 
picket the night of the 8th ; and being the only officer present 
for duty, with his Company, was called in to command it on the 
occasion of the Review on the 9th by the Acting Brigadier; 
that the heat of the day, or want of proper rest brought on a 
diarrhea which kept him up till nearly morning, when he fell 
asleep and failed to hear the call." Such is a not exaggerated 
statement of the manner in which we are worked; and to all 
the remonstrances from Regimental Headquarters, the powers 
that be turn a deaf ear. We have drawn for and received an 
issue of " Sibley tents," which has rendered a new laying out of 
the camp necessary. To render themselves comfortable, the 
boys have drawn a lot of boards, all official requisitions upon 
the Government for lumber proving ineffectual. 

The tents are now all well floored ; some of them comfortably 
fitted with bunks and doors. The regular morning inspection 
of the camp showed that a few more doors and windows were 
necessary to make all comfortable, and the Pioneers a handy 
set of fellows were directed to leave camp after taps, to procure 
the few articles we needed. This course was taken to prevent 
indiscriminate pillaging by the men. The raid was a success 
ful one, and the boys are enjoying the fruits of it. 

~LQth. Lieut. R. W. Walker who has been detained by sick 
ness in Mass., returned to-day, and Lieut. Goodrich starts to 
night for home, on ten days leave. 

12th. 

HEADQUARTERS IST BRIGADE,

" You are hereby ordered, personally, to make thorough examination of the camp of

" Commanding 34th Massachusetts Volunteers." 



HARPER S FEIIIJY. 131 

Whew! Hard times these, for the poor fellows who are 
worked half to death, and want a dry place to sleep on when 
they come in from duty! "Ah! Good morning, Capt," as 
responsive to my " come in " the officer of the day presented 
himself for instructions. " Sit down, Capt. What s the news? 
The Boys are pretty comfortable, now they have got their Sib- 
ley s, aren t they?" "Well, yes! I guess they want a few 
more boards, though, to finish up with." " Your Company is all 
right, is n t it, Capt ? " " Oh, yes, Col ! my boys are &\\ hunkey ! 
but then, some of them are a little short." " Well, Capt., I ve 
no new instructions for to-day ; but I 11 be obliged to you to 
call say in an hour from now and accompany me through 
the Camp. Complaint has been made, at Brigade Headquarters, 
that the Boys have been stealing Boards, and I am directed per 
sonally to search the Camp and arrest the occupants of every 
tent in which I find any ; and I desire you to accompany me on 
the search." "In about an hour, did you say, Col.?" "Yes, 
Capt." " You won t take notice of any small pieces, I suppose? " 
" Oh, no ! only floor boards" And so, when the examination 
occurred, it happened, curiously enough, that nothing could be 
found save pieces from three to four feet long; and as there 
was no ear mark by which to identify Government property, re 
port was made of the facts, and the Boys were undisturbed. 

But we were hardly out of this scrape before a new one 
threatened. A citizen of "Bolivar" presented his complaint 
that some soldiers, as he charged of the 34th, had been seen by 
him, the past night, carrying away the doors and windows from 
an unoccupied house in that Village which belonged to his 
brother. Alas! here, were our pioneers coming to grief! But 
they must be protected, also. " Well, my dear sir, allowing it 
to be true that your windows and doors were stolen, what 
makes you charge our boys with the theft? Don t you know 
Miner s men lay side of us? and that they all are a set of 
thieves? Penitentiary convicts?" "Yes, Colonel, I know 
they call them so ; but these fellows were Infantry men." 
"Well, don t you know that Miner s Caissons are full* of 
Infantry and Cavalry jackets?" "That may be, Colonel, but 
then they can t cheat me ! I found out these fellows right easy." 



132 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

44 No doubt you found out that the thieves were soldiers, but 
how dare you charge the theft upon the men of the 34th? 
44 Look here, noAV, Colonel ; mind I don t say they were your 
men ; I don t say any such thing ; only, that the thieves were 
Massachusetts men, and I don t know any Massachusetts 
troops here, but yours." 44 Yes, I see, but how did you make 
them out to be Massachusetts men at all ?" 44 Oh, right easy, 
Colonel, right easy ; I knowed them by their talk. When I 
told them to let the windows alone, one of them turned round 
and asked 44 Be these your windows?" and I knowed them right 
off!" Didn t I laugh at such evidence of citizenship? Confi 
dent in the success of a defence against such proof, if the 
charge was carried farther, the complainant was dismissed to the 
safe conduct of the Officer of the Guard, with a serious warn 
ing of the danger he incurred in attempting to thus injure the 
good name of the command. 

On the llth, at the close of a General Review and Inspection 
of the Garrison, by Gen. Lockwood, the 34th was required to 
go through various Batallion movements, and to exhibit its 
proficiency in the manual, followed by an exhibition of its skill 
as Skirmishers. Its movements, being directed by bugle call 
only, drew from the Reviewing Officer the highest praise ; from 
the Acting Brigadier, the exclamation, 44 By Jove, Adjutant, 
44 the boys can t beu improved ;" and from the men of the other 
organizations, deafening cheers. 

On the 12th an order came down to move the entire command. 
This was subsequently modified so far, that Companies 44 C " and 
u E " only, in support of one section of Miner s Battery, the 
whole commanded by Maj. Pratt, were required to march hastily 
to Charlestown, in answer to a call from Col. Simpson, who 
reported the presence of a force of Rebel cavalry, near him. 

A Review and Inspection of the Regimental Transportation 
at 5 A. M., and of the Regiment at six, on the morning of the 
14th, by Quartermaster Gen. Meigs; a Brigade drill on Maryland 
Heights, in the afternoon of the same day; (drawing from him 
the flattering remark, that 44 it was the finest Regiment he ever 
saw) ; " all this, added to our heavy daily details, have occupied 
us fully, the past week. A General Order received to-day, 
44 dishonorably dismisses Lieut. Butler from the service/ 



HARPER S FERRY. 133 

Deserters from the Rebels come in daily, averaging from six 
to twelve in number, and one day this last week, amounting to 
thirty. A member of Gen. Swell s staff, who is in our charge, 
states that if any certainty existed that this region would be 
held permanently by our forces, thousands of the Rebel army 
would desert at once. Packard, of " F," taken violently sick 
yesterday, immediately after bathing in the river, is given over 
by the Surgeons, who report that he can hardly live through 
the night. Babbitt, of " E," who suffers from sun-stroke, received 
on our duty of the 4th of July, is in Hospital, very low. A 
detail of one officer and ten men is ordered from us to-day, as 
guard over some Rebel prisoners, who are to be sent to Balti 
more. 

Judge Russell and wife are in camp, on a visit to our Col., and 
are now, we hope, enjoying a serenade by our band. 

We are a good deal annoyed by the presence in, and around 
camp, of the cows owned in the neighborhood ; in the absence 
of pasturage, our swill barrels furnishing a good deal of food. 
Our boys endeavor to draw pay in kind, although, owing to the 
wildness of the animals, they are not always successful. To 
render the operation of milking an entire success, a soldier 
holds fast each horn ; one has firm grip of the animal by the 
nose; another grasps the tail, while others, at each side, pull 
away at the teats. The little milk got in this way is much 
relished. 

18A. To-day we begin to prepare our winter quarters. We 
have placed some twenty of our horses in the basement of what 
was one of the most expensive and elegantly finished houses in 
the village. 

An order of Gen. Lockwood s, just received, directing an 
additional detail for picket, headed "Headquarters Defences 
Maryland Vols." excites hearty laughter among us. 

21s. The pay master is with us again, and his visit has 
additional interest, from the fact that the "clothing account" of 
the men, for the year, is to be settled. The Government allows 
to each man, on this account, forty-two dollars ; and while some of 
the boys have not drawn so much, others have so far exceeded 
the amount as to have absorbed some three months additional 
11 



134 . THIKTY-FOTJKTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

pay. As a whole, the clothing has been well made, and of 
good material ; but there is much complaint of that now issued. 

Lieut. Hall returned from Washington to-day, bringing up 
some fifteen of our men, who were transferred to general Hos 
pitals, at our hurried departure from that city in July. For a 
long time, these men have written, expressing their desire to 
rejoin us ; having been detailed as clerics, cooks, nurses, or in 
some like capacity, about the hospitals in which they were 
detained. All applications to the Surgeons in charge have 
been invariably returned, endorsed that " the men were unfit 
to be discharged." A representation to the Secretary of War 
direct, setting forth the facts, led to an order from that Depart 
ment, directing the Surgeons in charge of these hospitals to 
"turn over to any officer, detailed from the regiment to receive 
them, any man of the 34th within their control." 

Letters from home are almost daily received at Headquarters, 
naming different individuals as suitable persons to join us as 
Chaplains. But our reply is, that Inj their works, we should 
like to know them. The mania, for Commissions over colored 
troops, rages among the men with great violence, and various 
means are resorted to to insure success. But the most singular 
is the one just made known to us. 

It was forwarded to Headquarters by Gov. Andrew, to whom 
it was addressed, bearing His Excellency s endorsement " that 
Lieut. Col. Lincoln would express his opinion whether the man 
was adapted to and qualified for a command over Colored 
Troops." 

The letter was from one of our Sergeants, who wrote to the 
Governor that " he could have easily procured fifty men, and so 
" claimed a commission ; but that he enlisted as a private from a 
" sense of duty, not feeling entirely qualified to command ; but 
" that his situation is now changed. A year in the ranks has 
" qualified him for the situation of a commissioned officer. The 
" certificate of Hon. Mr. D., Member of Congress from his dis- 
" trict, will bear testimony to his standing in society." He further 
" states " that he abandoned a good business to join the Regi- 
" ment; that as a citizen of the town of K., he cast his vote in 
" favor of offering a bounty for volunteers, having also given 



HARPER S FERRY. 135 

"liberally from his private means; that he led the way in vol- 
" unteering on Saturday, and on Monday was in Camp with the 
" full quota of his town ; that he was Post Master, storekeeper 
" and member of the Republican County Committee ; that he 
" was of the convention when the Governor was first elected ; 
" that he listened to the address made by His Excellency in 
" which his own ideas and opinions were expressed exactly, but 
" that the ideas then entertained were now strengthened ten- 
" fold." Wherefore, and by reason of the foregoing, a hope was 
expressed that " the Governor would give to the writer of the 
" letter a commission over some Colored Troops, and enable him 
u to put to a better use the talents which were now wasted." 

Now it was easy enough to write that this man was well 
drilled as a soldier ; was of good habits ; attentive and faithful 
to duty, and of value to us in the ranks, all of which was true. 
But precisely this was not what was asked. The fact was, that 
though a good soldier, he had proved to be a poor non-commis 
sioned officer. Ignorant of what standard of qualification the 
Governor had set up as rendering a man " adapted for a com 
mand over Colored Troops," the only thing was to state the 
foregoing facts with the addition " that he would not do as an 
officer for us." 

Capt. Pratt and Lieut. Lincoln, both speaking in their natural 
tones and with their usual strength of voice last evening, are off 
duty this morning, each unable to speak above a whisper. 

Our " Born Chieftain " has been on the rampage again. 
Accompanied by his full staff, he visited certain houses where 
liquors are supposed to be sold ; and certain others of bad repute 
otherwise ; and, as a result of his raid, a medley of whites and 
blacks adorn the Provost Guard House this morning ; not one 
of ours, however, is among the number. Returning triumphantly 
from this foray, he fell upon our Patrol at Bolivar, and our 
Picket lines beyond, winning neither laurels nor victims. " Are 
" you out with the knowledge of your Colonel?" he asked of 
a Captain of the 10th Maryland, whom he met and arrested on 
the street. "I am out with my Colonel" was the reply. So 
the Colonel was hunted up, and thus accosted ; " Colonel, are 
" you out of your camp with the sanction of your superior offi- 



136 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" cer ? " " No, General." " Then why are you away at all ? " 
" Because, General, as Colonel of a Regiment, I claim the right 
" to be anywhere I please, within the limits of my Brigade ! " 
and Tie was allowed to pass. Not long after, the Colonel was 
roused from sleep by the beating of the long roll in his camp, 
and starting out, found his men hurrying on to line, in presence 
of the General, who, having ordered the alarm, was going down 
the lines, counting the files, to determine that the men of the 
command were present. Now this was no joke. In anticipa 
tion of any such little game upon us, Regimental General Orders 
have been issued to the Officers of the Guard, that whoever of 
them shall allow a " General alarm to be given in the camp of 
" the 34th, except by orders direct from our own Headquarters, 
" or in consequence of the near presence of the enemy, will be 
" at once arrested, and brought to court martial." 

Commissions have reached us for 2d Lieut. Ripley as 1st, and 
Sergeants Belser of E, and Kinnicutt of H, as 2d Lieutenants. 

For some unknown reasons there has been committed to the 
immediate charge of our own Regimental Camp Guard, two 
Rebel officers, claiming to be of Gen. Swell s staff. Our guard 
tent is also graced by the presence of two young ladies, also 
entrusted to our safe keeping, by higher authority. 

In addition to all former duties, we now send out a large 
fatigue party to procure timber for stockading our tents, and 
wood for our fires, our requisition for fuel having been returned, 
with an order " that the 34th will provide for all wants of this 
kind from the country near by." We have drawn, in conse 
quence, two hundred axes, and it won t be our fault if we don t 
have ample supply for all our wants. 

The Acting Brigadier persistently orders all brigade drills on 
" Maryland Heights," in deference to the Marylanders who don t 
like Virginia soil, thus requiring from us a long and toilsome 
march to and from the mountain. Of late some of the boys 
who don t really hanker after this additional fatigue, after 
marching on to line, have fallen out before crossing the river, 
and returned to camp. As a consequence of such performance 
to-day, nine men of " A " occupy the Guard House. Wilson of 
that company has deserted. A sharp little affair between 



HARPER S TERRY. 137 

Mosby s men and Cole s Cavalry, in which the latter suffered 
the loss of fifteen men, led to Company "C " being despatched, 
at a double quick, across the Shenandoah, arriving, however, 
too late to render any assistance. 

30^. Our usual brigade drill was suspended to-day, it being 
monthly inspection for the 34th, and pay-day for the 10th 
Maryland. 

Calligan, Corliss, and Allen, of "F," are sent to general 
Court Martial upon charges preferred by their Captain ; they 
having threatened to shoot him. 

We hear from Lieut. Elwell that he has recruited for us 
eleven men, five of whom have been forwarded to us. 

Sergeant Pennell of E, has applied and been recommended 
for a commission in some " Colored Regiment." He complains 
of our inactivity. Thus far, no one from our regiment has 
been rejected by the Examining Board. Two, who, having 
received promotion, left us at Upton s Hill, sleep their long 
sleep in the sands of Morris Island. 

Oct. 3c?. Pursuant to orders, at half-past eight the regiment 
took up its march for Maryland Heights, where the Brigade 
was reviewed by Major Gen. Kelley, commanding the " Army of 
Observation." The 34th secured his especial commendation. 

At the close of the parade, some of the officers rode out to 
Charlestown, where the 9th Maryland still is, in a state of 
nervous excitement. Application made by us to be allowed to 
exchange places with it, meets with a decided negative at 
brigade Headquarters. Firing, in that direction last night, 
kept us on the qui vive, and now, rockets from the direction 
of Key s ford furnish occasion for new anxiety. 

Gen. Lockwood is relieved from command here, and is to be 
succeeded by Brig. Gen. Sullivan, a son-in-law of Gen. Kelley. 
We get " King Stork " in exchange for " King Log." Wilson, 
who deserted a few days since, was returned to us, in arrest, 
to-day. Also Fuller of "A," and Smith of " K," two deserters 
from us while in Washington. In consequence of an affair in 
front, in which Capt. Somers, one of our best Cavalry officers 
has been killed, orders are received " to hold the entire Regi- 
" ment ready to move, at a moment s notice. Company " E," 



138 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" with one piece of Artillery, Capt. Bacon in command, is 
" directed to move at once/ Quartermaster Sergeant C. P. 
Trumbull, and Orderly Sergeant Pennell of " E," are directed, 
by orders from the War Department, to proceed at once to 
Washington, for examination for commissions in the colored 
troops. Another order from the same quarter, " requires the 
" commanding officer of the 34th Mass. Infantry to explain 
" without delay, why Field of " G " has not been discharged 
"from the Regiment, that he might accept a commission, in 
" accordance with General Orders to that effect." Inasmuch 
as no order to that effect had ever been received at Regimental 
Headquarters, there was no difficulty in making the explanation 
demanded. 

12th. We have to-day thirteen recruits in camp, eight of 
whom were brought up a day or two ago, by Lieut. Belser. 
These men, particularly the " Veterans," open wide their eyes 
at the amount of duty required from us. With a total effective 
force of six hundred and six, exclusive of warrant officers, 
our daily detail is for three hundred and sixty men. One of 
our recruits has had, since he reached us, seven fits! rather 
promising, that, at $700 ! 

14/i. Yesterday was marked in white to us, by its being 
pleasant, and NO Brigade Drill ; also, by the arrival of our new 
commander, Gen. Sullivan ; and the military order for a Grand 
Review, by both the out-going and in-coming Generals, supple 
mented by receipt about midnight, of additional orders " to move 
" at once to Maryland Heights." 

Just three months have passed since we crossed the Potomac, 
and occupied this place. All last night was spent in removing 
to " Berlin," by rail and wagon, the property of the Government 
stored here ; the men of the 34th standing to their arms, and 
the Batter} r " limbered." Early this morning we were required 
to furnish a Fatigue Detail, to assist in removing the " General 
Hospital." Couriers have been riding in hot haste between 
this place and " Charlestown." Trains filled with Government 
stores of all kinds are passing by from " Martinsburg." And 
now come orders directing us to pack everything, as we " leave 
not to return." It is too bad ! Our tents are all stockaded ;

timber nicely hewed each tent banked round, and nicely 
sodded Company streets thoroughly crowned, worked, and 
paved with brick. It was, an hour ago, a jewel of a camp ! 
but now everything is bare and naked. All property, both 
Government and Regimental, is loaded on to our wagons, and 
the Regiment waits only for orders to move. At 2 p. M., 
orders came down to send our entire transportation to report 
to Capt. Patten, Post Quartermaster. Our wagons were un 
loaded, property piled in camp, Guard placed over it ; and we 
waited till late in the evening, when, in absence of further 
orders, the men were directed to u lie upon their arms." 

15th. The order of yesterday from Brigade Headquarters to 
41 be ready to march at a moment s warning," was renewed at an 
early hour this morning. But at noon we were directed to 
unpack everything and resume our former situation, furnishing 
patrol and sending out pickets as before this grand scare. By 
General Orders " Headquarters Defences of the Potomac," Col. 
Wells is assigned to the command of this Post and of the 1st 
Brigade, 1st Division, "Army of Observation." He sweeps clean, 
as all new Brooms do. His first general order directs the clos 
ing of all places of business at nine P. M. ; prohibits all soldiers 
from being on the streets after that hour, and citizens from 
being out of doors after ten P. M., under penalty of arrest ; 
prescribes full uniform, dress coats, scales and white gloves to 
be worn by all Patrol and Headquarters Guards ; allows but 
two men from each Company to visit the Ferry at the same 
time ; and directs that every one so visiting the town shall be 
in full uniform and Avith side arms. 

As a relief to the monotony of our daily battalion drills, the 
Regiment has commenced the bayonet exercise, Col. Revere, of 
the 10th Maryland, instructor. 

11th. The sound of heavy guns rings on the ear from the 
front. Our situation is not pleasant. How often we have 
heard the cry of Wolf ! We wonder now, whether the animal is 
really prowling about, or whether all this alarm, of the past few 
days, is a ruse of the Generals to ensure the removal of a por 
tion of the immense amount of stores which have been gathered 
here since our occupation. The Regiment is in splendid condi- 



140 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

tion, and there is a great expression of hope that if the enemy 
desires our position, we may be allowed to try and hold it 
against them. Many people, from the near front, crowd our 
camp daily, giving utterance to expressions of surprise at the 
comparatively feeble garrison now here. Among them are the 
Messrs. H., father and son, Worcester -County men, now living 
near Halltown. The father, in conversation to-day, made the 
statement that at the time of the surrender of this Post last 
year, General Ewell, with his staff, made Headquarters at his 
house ; and, that to an assertion of his that the Rebel troops 
could not take the place, Swell s A. A. G. replied, that the place 
would be in the possession of the Confederate troops by noon of 
the day succeeding, and that too, -without firing a gun. And it 
proved to be so. 



CHAPTER XVI. 



BATTLE OF RIPOX. 

We have had our "baptism of blood." 
Yesterday, at Revielle, a single discharge of artillery was 
heard from the direction of Charlestown, to which no especial 
attention was paid. When returning from breakfast, however, 
three other distinct reports were heard, and turning I hurried 
to Brigade Headquarters. All were in led. " We have no 
artillery in Charlestown, Col." " What you ve heard, must be 
practice firing at Martinsburg." Now, inasmuch as Charlestown 
was but eight miles away in one, while Martinsburg was twenty- 
two miles distant in another direction, this explanation was not 
quite satisfactory. But, in justice to the Col. commanding, it 
ought here to be stated (what was not learned till after the 
affair of the day was over), that the reason why no attention 
was paid to the report of the firing, was, that as late as two 
o clock of that morning, a courier had brought, from Col. 
Simpson, at Charlestown, a written report that "his cavalry 
had just come in from a scout, and that there was no rebel 
force within twenty miles of him." This information Avas not 
communicated, however, and, dissatisfied with my reception, I 
hurried to camp, and caused the regiment to be turned out, in 
complete marching order. Hearing nothing farther to cause alarm, 
the companies were allowed to stack their arms, and the men to 
separate, with the caution not to put off their equipments. 
The reliefs, from the provost and patrol guard, coming into 
camp at this time, for breakfast, were sent back, with orders 
to return at once with their arms and equipments. No other 
preparation could be made, and, in company with several officers, 
I took position on the breastworks, where a look-out could be 
had over the pike. While engaged thus, a single heavy gun 

12 



142 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

was heard again, and soon a horseman turned the heights of 
" Bolivar." Our glasses showed us that he wore our uniform, 
that he was bare headed, and that he was urging his jaded 
beast with spur and sabre. Messengers were at once despatched 
to the officers on picket, " to send in every man, not on actual 
post ; and all turned to watch the horseman, who, galloping- 
through the camp, had already reached brigade Headquarters. 

The tranquility reigning there was not disturbed ; and orders 
were about being issued to dismiss the men, when " Look there, 
Colonel," exclaimed Capt. Bacon; and directing our glasses 
again to the front, another mounted soldier was seen, bare 
headed, and hurrying at speed toward us. Without waiting 
his arrival "the Assembly" was sounded. Meanwhile the messen 
ger had gained Brigade Headquarters, and, dismounting, dis 
appeared from our sight. In an instant, Orderlies, mounted 
and on foot, hurried away in all directions. The one sent to 
us with orders to get under arms, without delay, was directed 
to report the " regiment on line ready to march." So soon as 
the Battery could harness, we were ordered to move. 

At "Halltown" a halt was ordered that " canteens " might 
be filled, and arms loaded. Here the Battery passed us, at a 
sharp gallop ; and Company " A," Capt. Willard, was detached 
in support. 

The regiment followed at a quick step, and again three 
Artillery shots fell upon the ear. A messenger from Major 
Cole, commanding a small squad of Cavalry, which had been 
hurried from camp in Bolivar, now rode up with information 
that he (Cole) had struck the enemy, who had fallen back into 
" Charlestown." Another Orderly soon followed, reporting 
that the enemy was in force, consisting of mounted Infantry 
and Cavalry, with six pieces of Artillery, the whole commanded 
by Imboden ; that they were already in retreat ; that he, 
Cole, was harrassing them, but was nearly out of ammunition. 
The sharp crack of Miner s rifled pieces was soon heard, and 
the boys, responding with a cheer, broke into a " double 
quick." As we neared Charlestown, overturned wagons, 
scattered papers, broken muskets, cast off equipments, and, 
saddest of all, bodies of dead soldiers, at which swine were 



1MPON. 143 

already rooting, and upon which, from the doors of near 
dwelling houses, beings in female garb were steadily gazing, 
lined the road. We marched through the Village, out on to 
the pike leading to " Berry ville," soon coming up with "A," 
halted by the side of the road, about a mile out. Word now 
reached us from Cole that he could not hold the enemy, but 
was himself forced to give ground ; so forward we pushed, 
again at a double quick. 

Company U F," Capt. Chandler, was sent to the left, and 
Company " C," Lieut. Cobb, to the right, in order as skirmish 
ers ; while the Regiment advanced by the Pike. Here Capt. 
Bacon, who had been on duty as Field Officer of the day at the 
Ferry, joined us and assumed command of his Company. (Capt. 
A. I). Pratt, who on account of sickness had been off duty for 
weeks, having volunteered to relieve him.) "Shell" now began 
to fly over our heads, and soon we heard the reports of our 
own rifles as the skirmishers got engaged. The country over 
which we were advancing was rolling; wooded knolls covered 
with timber, open enough, however, for the passage of artillery, 
with intervening hollows of cultivated land at short musket range 
distance, offered favorable positions for a retreating force, and 
we gained one hill after a stout resistance, only to find the 
enemy in possession of the next, and awaiting our advance. 

The resistance was becoming more stubborn, when word was 
brought that Lieut. Cobb was dangerously wounded, and Lieut. 
Goodrich was despatched to assume command of the Company, 
and send Cobb to the rear. Our advance was now by the pike. 
As the head of the Regiment topped the crest of a knoll on the 
left of which Miner, with one section, was wheeling into position, 
a shell struck the ground, but without exploding, within a few 
feet of our leading files , a second followed, bursting over our 
heads, but doing no injury ; and a third came, taking off the hind 
legs of both of Miner s wheel horses. From another gun, away 
to the right, came chunks of railroad iron, pieces of chains and 
bundles of horse shoes bound together with telegraph wire, 
making most devlish screeching as they cut their way among 
the branches of the trees. A rapid flank movement on our part 
with a purpose of cutting off this last piece, a twenty-four pound- 



144 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

er, was discovered, and the Rebels, rapidly limbering up, with 
drew it in safety. A turn in the road brought us again out on 
the pike, and, as the leading files showed, shells and shot from 
the Rebel artillery struck, and covered us with dirt and stones. 
Again we crossed into the fields and advanced in line. 

Here a message was received from Cole, to the effect that he 
was overpowered, and compelled to give ground, coupled with 
a request that we would hurry to his assistance. The mes 
senger, assuring us that our movements would be covered from 
observation, by high ground on the right, remained with us to 
pilot our movement. Coming out on to the pike, we were 
advancing at a double quick, anxiously looking for the where 
abouts of Cole, when the protecting ground to our right, fell 
off, leaving the head of the column uncovered. As the leading 
company, "E," was exposed, the Rebels, who were in position, 
secured from observation by the timber on our right and front, 
met us with a fire from three pieces of his artillery, and a 
deafening volley from his muskets. To halt and form, was the 
work of but a minute. But we were none too quick; for a body 
of cavalry suddenly charged upon us, perhaps expecting to 
find us in confusion from the unexpected fire to which we were 
exposed. Dressed in our uniform, and slowly falling back towards 
us, when first seen, they were taken for Cole s men. As they 
neared us they discharged their carbines, and wheeling, fled. 
But company H, facing about, was quick enough with its fire to 
empty four or Jive saddles. The contest, at this place, was sharp, 
for some moments ; the 34th alone contending for the ground. 
Here, and at this time, fell Corp. Gage of " E, " bearing the white 
flag of the State, shot through the heart; and Clark of " K." of 
the color guard, hit in the breast, each dying without a word. 
McDaniels of " E," hit in the foot, sat down, cut out the ball 
with his jackknife, and resumed his place and firing. A ball 
passed through the pants of the Lieut. Col. commanding, just 
grazing the flesh of the thigh, and lodged in the saddle blanket. 

Company E, which had advanced entirely beyond the pro 
tection of the high land which covered our approach, was for a 
moment, a little demoralized, its members crying out "Gaye is 
killed! McDaniels is wounded ! Clark is dead /" But they were 



KTPOX. 145 

recovered by their gallant Capt. Bacon, who, in facing the 
storm of bullets falling thickly round him, called out, " shut up 
your mouths, -boys, and let your rifles do the talking for you." 
He was conspicuous for his cool and daring conduct throughout. 

Miner now came up, and shelled the woods in which the 
enemy had been posted, and, under cover of his fire, we 
advanced, to find Imboden again posted on the crest of a knoll 
still farther to the rear. Here again the contest was renewed. 
Slowly, and in this manner, we gained ground ; every inch of 
the way stubbornly contested, until about 5 P. M., Avhen an 
Orderly from Gen. Sullivan, at the Ferry, reached us, bringing 
orders to cease the pursuit, and we laid down to rest. Our 
force engaged was the 17th Indiana Battery, Capt. Miner, six 
six pounders, rifled; Maj. Cole s Maryland Battalion, about 
one hundred and fifty strong, with about thirty Cavalry scouts ; 
and the 34th Massachusetts, about four hundred and fifty men, 
Lieut. Col. Lincoln, commanding; the whole under Col. Geo. 
D. Wells, Acting Brigadier General. Of the rest of the Brigade, 
the 9th Maryland, Col. Simpson, had been surprised and nearly 
all captured early in the morning, the Field Officers only escap 
ing ; and the 10th Maryland, Col. Revere, ordered out at the 
time we were, but having about two miles farther to march, did 
not " get up " till after the pursuit was ordered to be stopped. 
In their advance upon the road we had fought over, they 
discovered, and brought down from trees by the wayside, four 
or five Rebels, who, from their elevated posts, had signaled to 
Imboden the changing position of our forces, and thus enabled 
him to get such exact range of our column. 

We secured as trophies, a Cavalry Forge one wagon loaded 
with sabres, other arms and equipments, bags of flour, etc., 
and divers papers of the command, among them a muster and 
pay-roll of a company of " White s Battalion," for the last 
month. 

Rebel prisoners state their force at 2,500, under Imboden in 
person ; consisting of Cavalry, mounted Infantry, and six pieces 
of Artillery one twenty-four pounder, two twelve pounders, 
and three rifled sixes. 

The official return of our Brigade shows a loss of seven 



146 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

killed, forty-two wounded, exclusive of the 9th Maryland, 
which regiment had one killed, three wounded, and two hundred 
and seventy-three captured. Our own loss was two killed, 
one dangerously, and seven slightly wounded. At this, our 
first engagement, our boys were a good deal excited, firing at 
random. Particularly was this so, at the moment, when, 
while moving to Cole s support, we so unexpectedly met that 
awful storm of fire from the concealed enemy. To recover 
them the order to " cease firing," was given. The advantage 
of cover, possessed by a portion of the command, was pointed 
out, and they were admonished of the necessity of loading 
leisurely, aiming carefully, and firing deliberately. Soon they 
were themselves, when firing was resumed, and from this time 
they were steady enough ; the boys greeting with a hearty 
laugh one little fellow who, jumping on to the top of the bank, 
behind which he had been protected, leveled his musket, and 
with the exclamation " Continue the same," blazed away. 

The pursuit was not without its amusing incidents. The 
A. A. A. G., at one time in advance of the line, rode in, 
escorting a Rebel soldier whom he had captured, and turned 
him over to an Irishman, with directions to keep a close watch 
of him. " Niver fear, Mr. Adjutant, niver fear ! If the spalpeen 
runs I ll prod him with this little tooth-pick," at the same time 
shaking his bayonet. Another of our boys, also an Irishman, 
seeing two Rebels crossing his path, jumped behind a tree, and, 
leveling his piece, called to them to halt. As they stood at 
his challenge, he thus broke out : " Well, what are you going 
to do now?" "Surrender!" they cried out. "Why don t you 
do it, then ? throw down them murdering guns, or by the holy 
Moses I ll shoot you both!" and, in an aside, "the poor 
craythurs don t know she aint loaded." 

Capt. Chandler, with his Company, had an opportunity of 
testing our movement, " Cavalry ! rally by Company !" His 
men, deployed as skirmishers, had been advancing through a 
field of standing corn; and, as his line reached u the opening," he 
caught sight of a body of Rebel Cavalry " coming for him." 
There. was no time to reach his reserve, even if he could have 
seen precisely where it was ; so, giving the order above, his 



RIPOX. 147 

men rallied round him at a run. The Cavalry recoiled before 
the circle of bristling bayonets, fired their carbines without 
injury to us, and wheeling, fled. It was Chandler s turn then, 
and, at his order, a bright flame poured from his pieces, and 
as the smoke cleared, five riderless horses were galloping away. 

Lieut. Cobb, dangerously wounded, the ball having entered 
the head between the eyes, carrying with it from his cap the 
lace number of his regiment, was left in a farm house at 
Ripon, unconscious. Bringing off the bodies of our dead, and all 
our wounded, we commenced our homeward march about 
6 P. M., reaching camp without a straggler, near midnight ; 
having marched in fifteen hours, thirty-six miles, without food, 
fighting over six miles of the way. 

The flag given to the Regiment by the ladies of Worcester, 
shows marks of being struck by six bullets. 

2lst. Surgeon Clarke went out to Ripon yesterday, and 
brought in Lieut. Cobb, wounded in the affair of the 18th. He 
is still unconscious. 

The men are sleeping upon their arms to-night, and an order 
to move is (now, half past 1 A. M.,) momentarily expected. 
Lieut. Belser left us to-day to rejoin our recruiting party in 
Massachusetts. 

25th. Lieut. Cobb is more comfortable, and we now have 
hopes of his recovery. His friend and nurse, Mr. Phelps, of 
Boston, has gone to Headquarters at Clarksburg, hoping to 
obtain sick leave for him. 

Two of our men who, at our hurried departure from Wash 
ington were transferred to general hospital, rejoined us a day or 
two ago, and reported for duty. To-day a letter was received 

at Headquarters, from a Captain of Company of the Invalid 

Corps, reporting them as deserters from his command, and ask 
ing the commander of the regiment to arrest and return them 
to Harrisburg, for trial and punishment. Now, these men have 
been borne upon our rolls to the present time ; no notice of any 
transfer to any other organization having ever been communi 
cated to us. They state that, upon their arrival at Harrisburg, 
learning their fate, they were disgusted, and took French leave ; 
setting out and walking to this place. With tears in their eyes 



148 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

they profess their ability to serve with us, and they beg, most 
earnestly, not to be sent back. They will not be surrendered, 
except upon the imperative order of the War Department. 

A communication from the Secretary of War to Gen. Sullivan, 
complimenting him that for once, " Harper s Ferry is garrisoned 
by a force, and under a commander who dared march to find an 
enemy" has been received, and made public. .Our drill to-day, 
changed to a skirmish, from Battalion, at the request of officers 
of other commands, drew crowds of applauding men and officers 
from neighboring camps. So much for gratification. As set 
off, a starving damsel, fat, not fair^ but forty at least, besieged 
Headquarters, loudly complaining against some of the boys, 
who, she alleged, had carried from her premises, " a small piece 
of planlc, and three cabbages." 

In contrast to this, appeared the smiling faces of seven of the 
boys, with applications that quarters might be provided for 
their wives just arrived. 

The weather is cold ; ice forming an inch thick in camp. 

The Acting Brigadier, called to-day, as he said, to tell us 
that lie thought the camp the prettiest thing of the kind which 
he had ever seen. 

Nov. ls. Yesterday was our bi-monthly Inspection and 
Muster for pay. Visitors from Massachusetts were with us. 
" Why Col.," said one, Mr. W. T. D., of Greenfield, "your 
arms are in most splendid condition, and look, to me, as well 
as if just from the armory ! " It was intended as a compliment, 
but it was mortifying beyond measure ; and we sent the Quar 
termaster for some which had never been issued, that he might 
see the contrast about what there is between a most highly 
polished piece of cutlery, and a well finished shovel. 

We have had in camp for a few days past, a one-horse minis 
ter, accredited by the Christian Commission " to the army in 
the field." As a whole, little benefit has resulted from the 
presence, among us, of this class of men. Failing to understand, 
as nearly all of them do, their proper duty, they secure neither 
respect nor consideration from officers or men. The oft er by 
this one to officiate at our evening parade on Sunday next, was 
gladly accepted ; but, perceiving how ignorant he was of all 



TJTPOX. 149 

camp life, its routine and duty, he was informed that if the 
weather should continue damp, drizzling, and chilly, as it then 
was, he must not be disconcerted at an order to the men to 
" remain covered," during his service. " What ! " he exclaimed, 
raising his hands in horror at the intimation, " What ! approach 
the throne of Almighty God, in prayer, with covered heads!" 
"As well so, sir, as with unbended knee ; our first duty is to 
preserve the health of the command, and if the heart is right, 
what matter where the cap is?" But, spite of his offer, he was 
not present. In his absence, the Rev. Mr. F., also of the Com 
mission, introduced himself, and volunteered for the duty. His 
prayer was short, but touchingly eloquent. Pointing to our 
flag, upright before our eyes, and riddled with balls, he spoke 
of our recent baptism, asking God s blessing upon the flag and 
all engaged in its defence. 

The old fellow, who watched the proceedings from his room, 
at a little distance, thus alluded to the matter : " I was sorry, 
" Col., that I could not be present at your parade, for I couldn t 
" bear to disappoint 4 the boys, as you call them. How did 
"you get along?" "Oh! nicely, sir, nicely! We had a very 
" touching service." " Service, Col. ! Service ! Why, how was 
"that? I watched your movements, and I don t see IIOAV you 
" could have had any. It must have been very short." Yes, sir, 
" short ; not longer than five minutes, but eloquent and impres 
sive." "Five minutes! Five minutes! Why, Col., I couldn t 
" have got through my introduction in that time ! ! ! " " Oh ! 
" my dear sir, it s just the introduction that we were afraid of. 
" Standing in the cold and wet, we don t want any of that." 

Our wounded are doing nicely. Lieut. Cobb has left for 
home, on sick leave. Howe, shot in the breast, and Mockly^ in 
the thigh, will both be out shortly. McDanieh, hit in the foot, 
will be confined longer. 

5th. Another night alarm, and the regiment ordered to 
Halltown, where it bivouacked, returning this morning. So 
quietly was our move conducted, that Miner, of the battery, 
whose Headquarters are within our lines, knew nothing of it. 

Deserters and contrabands are coming in, in considerable 
numbers, daily. These, with prisoners who are sent in by the 



150 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

cavalry in front, agree that Imboden is chafing under the affair 
of the 18th, and is moving down the valley, for this post, and its 
garrison. Post General Order of to-day forbids any person 
leaving the village, in any direction. 

Our old Minister, the one who couldn t pray when our heads 
were covered, affords us all much amusement. In his wander 
ings, he has come across an uninhabited house, which he thinks 
would accommodate the men of two companies, and which he is 
anxious the men should be allowed to occupy, being so much 
more comfortable than our tents. He has no idea of the 
necessity of keeping embodied, nor does he understand, why, 
if there is anything comfortable within reach, it is not appro 
priated at once. If I should listen to him, I should let loose 
the boys to do as they pleased. In contrast to what he advises, 
I show him an order from Brigade Headquarters, reciting 
complaints against the men, for plundering; and directing the 
camp to be thoroughly searched, and the inmates of any tent, 
where should be found any boards used for flooring, to be 
arrested and punished. " Is that possible ? " he exclaimed ! 
" When it is so muddy, too ? Well Col., I must have done 
wrong then, as I have just been telling some of the men;, where 
they could find some good ones. I guess I d better go right 
back, and tell them not to touch them at all." 

He was not quite pacified by an assurance that I would take 
care of the boys, for said he, " Col. there are the boards, and 
here are your orders ! " " True ! but the officer, who makes the 
search, will be instructed to take no notice of any short pieces 
he may see, and it will somehow happen that he won t find 
any but short pieces." " I see ! Col." said he, with a merry 
twinkle of his eye, " I see." And I think the old fellow 
actually thought it was a righteous way of executing the order. 

He speaks of our men as a band of devoted Christian broth 
ers ; and seems astonished at the assertion, that rigid discipline 
has made, and keeps them what they are ; inasmuch, as he says, 
that he can discover nothing which looks as if it ever had been, 
or was now practised. 

Qth. Another night alarm ; and for the Regiment, another 
night s bivouac at Halltown. Surgeon Clark greeted his wife, 



TMPON. 151 

upon her visiting camp to-day. They, with the Quartermaster 
and his wife, are to have quarters in an unoccupied house in 
the village. 

ItJi. Imboden, as our scouts report, is at Berry ville, and 
our cavalry are in motion. A note from Gen. Sullivan s Head 
quarters, gives us warning " to be ready to march to-night." 

A queer incident, showing how much more strange truth is 
than fiction, happened to-day. Last August, one of K s men 
was granted a furlough. Over-staying his time, he was reported 
as a deserter. After a while, he was heard of as being in the 
city of Albany. His " descriptive list " was sent to the Provost 
Marshal of that place, and the man was identified, arrested, and 
forwarded to general rendezvous, in the City of New York. 
Soon after, we received notice, that the man was at the camp 
of distribution. An officer was sent for him, but was informed 
that no such man was in the camp. Not long after, an official 
letter, from the Quarter-master at that camp, was received at 
Headquarters, containing charges for clothing, delivered to the 
man. This was returned with the endorsement that as the man 
was not present to be surrendered upon our demand, that fact 
would be regarded as evidence that the clothing could not have 
been issued to him. So the matter has stood for months. But 
to-day, the man presented himself at Headquarters, bearing a 
letter from the selectmen of Pittsfield, endorsed by Captain 
Cooley, his former commander, containing the -statement, 
that the man had expressed a desire to rejoin the regiment, 
and, at their request, the Provost Marshal had forborne to arrest 
him ; and concluding with a hope that we should not feel under 
obligation to inflict punishment upon him. 

According to the man s story, he reached Baltimore, on his 
return to the regiment, at the expiration of his furlough ; and 
soon after, found himself in Albany, where he was arrested and 
sent to New York ; that he tvas forwarded to the " Camp of 
Distribution" near Alexandria, which he left, and walked in 
his uniform, without hindrance, back to Pittsfield, where friends 
advised him to return to us ; and he had done so. He is in the 
Guard House, to await final determination of his case. What 
an infliction we have been called upon to endure ! At parade 



152 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

to-night, we were dreadfully bored by our old minister, who 
still hangs around ; and who preached to us for more than a 
half hour, by the watch, upon the doctrine of predestination. 

The men had such dreadful coughs, before the close of the 
service, that a stranger might have had serious alarm for the 
health of the command. But we have only about sixty under 
surgeon s care. 

The 10th Maryland returned from Baltimore, to-day, where it 
was ordered, that its members might vote at the election, just 
had in that city. Upon arrival here, it was ordered to proceed 
to Martinsburg. The 1st Virginia Battery, (Furst s) six Napo 
leons, moved up close to our breastworks, this afternoon ; their 
horses being left harnessed. 

~LQth. The day is beautiful ; a light snow fell last night, and 
the weather is quite cold. All day long, a crowd of complain 
ing citizens have thronged Headquarters. Every old woman 
who loses a cabbage, and every man who misses a brick, or piece 
of board, goes straightway to Brigade, or Division Headquarters, 
and forthwith comes an Orderly, bearing a despatch, calling 
the attention of " Lieut. Col. Lincoln, commanding the 34th 
" Massachusetts Infantry " to the alleged " ill doings of the men 
" of his command." Pretty hard, this ! at least on the part of 
the Acting Brigadier, who knows, as we all do, that the men of 
Miner s Battery are pardoned penitentiary convicts ; and that 
straggling Cavalry men, without discipline, or control of any 
kind, are continually ravaging the country ! Besides, our tents 
are floored, now, and have been for some time; and we don t 
want any more boards. Two deserters were returned to us 
to-day ; one, arrested in Massachusetts last June, and the other 
left by us, under charges, at our departure from Washington. 

13fA. Six recruits reached us to-day, making twenty whom 
we have received. Three of them are given to fits; are entirely 
worthless, not having done a day s duty since joining ; and the 
worst one of the lot cost the most, being what is termed a "Vet- 
" eran Recruit," at $700. Two of our boys received commissions 
by to-day s mail ; one as Captain, the other as 1st Lieutenant in 
the 9th United States Colored Troops. Thus far, we have 
furnished seven commissioned officers to other Regiments ; and 



KIPOX. 

have in camp now another man, carrying in his pocket a com 
mission, and awaiting an order, from the War Department, 
directing his discharge from the Regiment. 

Orders from Brigade Headquarters direct, that in future, our 
fatigue party of wood choppers shall be armed, and that no 
wagons be sent for wood unless under suitable escort. 

Just now we are victims to red tape. Just previous to our 
departure from Washington, three of our officers, having just 
received promotions, were sent up to General Headquarters to 
be mustered in. In the excitement consequent upon Gettys 
burg, or perhaps from the hurry of sending off troops, the mus 
tering officer could not attend to them ; and, without being 
mustered, they were assigned to duty in accordance with their 
rank. Two of them, some time since, visited Department Head 
quarters to be mustered, but were ordered back, with the infor 
mation that a proper officer would be detailed to visit the 
Regiment, for the performance of this duty. So, on the 27th of 
August last, a regularly appointed mustering officer appeared 
among us, and all three of these officers were duly mustered to 
the rank to which they were commissioned, as of date the Qth of 
July, the day on which they received their commissions, and 
were assigned to duty. 

But to-day s mail brings an order from the War Department, 
setting aside the action of this officer, directing the muster of 
two of them to date from August 27th, and absolutely revoking 
the muster of the third one. 

So also of Carr, a Sergeant of ours. He holds a commission 

as Lieutenant in the Regiment, New Jersey Infantry ; a 

letter from the Adjutant General of that state to his brother, 
Genl. Carr, now serving with the Army of the Potomac, and 
still another letter, from the General himself, forwarding the 
commission and notifying him of his appointment to a position 
on his (the General s) staff. All these documents were duly 
forwarded from Regimental Headquarters, with an application 
from Carr, approved, asking his discharge from the 34th, to 
accept promotion in the New Jersey line. But they were re 
turned by Maj. Genl. Kelley, commanding Department, with the 
endorsement : u Denied. There is no evidence that there is any 
vacancy, to fill which this commission is issued" 



154 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Upon the heels of all this comes an order from Gen. Sullivan 
forbidding any soldier from appearing with the badge of a rank 
to which he has not been properly mustered. What shall poor 
do ? He was mustered out as a Sergeant, and mustered in 
as a 2d Lieutenant ; assigned to duty as such officer ; acting as 
such even now, although his muster has been revoked by the 
War Department. The revocation of his muster in as 2d Lieu 
tenant does not cancel his muster out as Sergeant. Besides, his 
place as Sergeant is filled. He is to us Lieutenant or nothing. 
He do n t want to leave us. We do n t want to spare him. He 
can t resume his chevrons, nor wear his bar, according to Sulli 
van. What shall he do? 

Various parties of Guerrillas are hovering near us, and orders 
from Brigade Headquarters forbid our sending out teams for 
wood except under strong escort, and direct all chopping details 
to be armed. 

16th. Our work is severe and harassing beyond description, 
and nearly beyond endurance. Two of our very best men were 
taken down to-day; the Surgeon s report, from overwork. We 
lost a man in hospital last night, as the Doctors say, from mince 
pie, he having bought and eaten the whole of one. Sergeant 
W., of A has taken to himself a girl from the village, to be Mrs. 
W., No. 2. Col. Wells is detailed to Court Martial, and the 
command of the Brigade is assigned by Genl. Sullivan, to Lieut. 
Col. Lincoln; Col. Simpson of the 9th Maryland being under a 
cloud from the affair of the 18th of Oct., at Charlestown. 

What a host of applications are pouring in from the boys to 
be allowed to appear before the Examining Board at Washing 
ton ! Corporal Granville and Sergeants Hull of K, and Rhodes 
of A, already commissioned, leave to-night. G/s life, as detailed 
by him, has been a checkered one, indeed. He formerly lived 
in Boston, was engaged in trade, lost largely and failed ; left 
secretly for the west, first writing a note to his wife that his 
body would probably be found in Charles River; was prospered 
in his new home, and after awhile returned and compromised 
with his old creditors ; engaged as a school teacher in W., and 
enlisted from that town as a private in the 34th ; was soon ad 
vanced to be a Corporal, and is now commissioned a Captain in 
the 9th Regiment U. S. Colored Troops. 



RIPOX. 1 55 

Corporal Wiswall of " C," now one of our Recruiting party 
in Massachusetts, is, by order from the War Department, 
received to-day, " relieved from farther duty in the 34th, and 
"directed to report immediately to Maj. Gen. Banks, for duty 
" in the Corps D Afrique. " Capt. Pratt, of that Company, in 
answer to a note from Headquarters, directing him to forward 
the name of some suitable person, to fill Wiswall s place, writes 
thus: "I have the honor, in obedience to orders from Head- 
" quarters, to forward the name of a man, who will use his 
" energy in procuring Recruits for the 34th, instead of, for him- 
" self, a commission in any Corps D Afrique. The Paymaster 
is here, and all are made happy by his presence. 

21st. The officers are making plans for a grand ball, on 
Thanksgiving night; and, at their request, two of our teams 
have been employed in bringing into camp evergreen boughs, 
with which to cover the charcoal sketches upon the walls of 
the Lockwood House, in which the ball is to be held. 

23cZ. A note from Gen. Sullivan, giving information that he, 
with his staff, and the ladies of his family, would be present at 
parade to-night, leads to its being ordered in all the blaze of 
dress coats, scales, white gloves and sashes. 

25th. Post Greneral Order commits Lieut. B , of Miner s 

Battery, under charges for highway robbery, to the custody of 
the 34th, "to be held as close prisoner ;" and the Lieutenant 
Colonel commanding is notified that " he will be held personally 
" responsible for the appearance of the prisoner, when called 
"for." Rather unpleasant for the Lieutenant Colonel; and 
decidedly hard lines for the Lieutenant, who, of course, must 
be subjected to the mortification of being guarded by an armed 
sentinel. Our ball-room, decorated with wreaths, and branches 
of evergreens, is looking beautifully. A spread eagle, made of 
twigs and sprays of evergreen, is neatly done, and attracts 
much attention. There has been much anxiety, and a good deal 
of discussion as to the entertainment. A caterer from Balti 
more suggests cold smeats, raw and pickled oysters, and cheese ! 
A little Nig. about camp, says, "Poick," as he terms pig, and 
" Cologne Sausage." 

Lieut. Lincoln, commanding a guard of twenty men, has left 



156 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

for Wheeling, to deliver to the authorities there, thirty-five 
Rebel prisoners. Among them are the A. A. G., and the I. G., 
and chief of staff of Gen. Pembertori. 

Lieut. Hall, with proper guard, goes to Washington, having 
in charge nine deserters from our forces, who have been 
arrested here ; and is under orders to bring back seven recruits 
for us, now in that city, waiting transportation hither. 

We had a sudden death in hospital to-day. The man had 
been sick about a week, but not enough to be confined to his 
bed. He complained only of a pain in the head. He ate his 
meals regularly and his supper to-night ; yet soon afterwards 
he dropped off without moan or struggle. 

26 th. Thanksgiving at home ! and in honor of the day, no 
drills, nor fatigue, but permission given to about one hundred 
of the men to visit the village. Passes to do so are always 
granted early in the morning, and distributed at guard mount 
ing ; the number determined by the Regimental Commander. 
But this morning, Wells, newly appointed to the command of 
the Post, sent down an order forbidding more than two men 
from each company being away from camp, at the same time. 
On the whole, it was concluded not to recall those already 
issued for to-day, but obey the new order to-morrow. Soon a 
rap, and, from the orderly, " The Col s, compliments, and he 
desires you to report at his quarters instantly," which being 
done, "How s this, Col? didn t you receive an order, this 
morning, restricting the number of passes from your camp ! " 
" Yes, sir ! " " Well, I ve just returned from the village, and 
I saw, on the street, double the number of your men, that that 
order allows." " You couldn t have seen near all of them, 
Col., if that is your count, for there s more than three times the 
number down there ! " " And yet you received my order ? " 
" Oh, yes, sir ! But my boys were down town before your 
Adjutant \vas out of bed. If you want an order obeyed the 
day it is issued, you must get your family out of bed earlier. 
The Col. laughed, and admitted ive had kirn, concluding the 
interview by requesting the Parade to be had at 3 p. M., for the 
gratification of Gen ls. Kelly and Averill, who were present in 
town. Oar line was formed at the appointed hour, but no 



RIPOX. 157 

Generals appeared. As the Parade was dismissed, an orderly 
rode up, with a request to hold the regiment, for the arrival of 
the Generals, who, with a bevy of ladies, were, at the time, 
inspecting the camp. Upon their appearance, the parade was 
repeated, its close being marked by many expressions of 
praise from the Generals; Averill being especially compli 
mentary. 

27th. Thanksgiving has come and gone ; and with it the 
ball given by our officers; Gens. Kelley, Averill, and Sullivan, 
and acting Brigadiers Wells and Maulsby, of the renowned 
fct&gt; Potomac Home Brigade," with the officers of their respective 
staffs, honoring the affair with their presence. Kelley is a tall, 
angular looking personage, with a thin, hatchet-like face, and 
grayish hair and whiskers ; from 5;") to 08 years of age. He was 
dressed in an old seedy grey suit, and looked like a Quaker, 
run to seed. Sullivan, about 8f), large size, stout built, with a 
just springing black moustache, and keen black eye, looked 
more the soldier than he actually is. Averill, a spruce little 
fellow, about 80, light and wiry, full of life and activity, 
dressed in a close-fitting cavalry jacket, is to all seeming the 
beau ideal of a dragoon. Wells, you know. Maulsby made his 
appearance in the glare and glitter of lace and bullion, enough 
for a hundred officers like him. A splendid sash of orange 
silk, interlaced with gold threads, and belt thickly embossed 
with gilt leaves, circled his body. A pair of heavy bullion 
epaulettes ornamented his shoulders, and seemed to weigh him 
down with their gorgeous magnificence. No officer, other than 
he, showed in any but the plain shoulder straps pertaining to 
his rank. 

The ladies, God bless them ! were there in large numbers. 
And oh ! the dresses ! and ah ! the wn-dresses ! Sprigged mus 
lins, and other gauze-like fabrics, floated round forms of 200 
pounds, at the least, of good solid adipose matter ; and heavy, 
stiff black silks stood out from and helped cover skeletons, 
whose bones could almost be heard rattling an accompaniment 
to the music of the dance. Flashy calicoes contrasted with 
heavy, glaring red merinos. High-necked and long-sleeved 
dresses, jealously guarded from, perchance, a too searching eye, 
13 



158 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

the least particle of flesh, dry and withered too often, it is true ; 
and again, there were other dresses so cut and disposed as to 
reveal the rich amplitude of shoulders and bosom to any who 
would not turn away. 

The rooms looked beautifully. A chandelier, made by a cir 
cle of bayonets, suspended from the ceiling, being particularly 
admired. 

For supper we had three varieties of cake, piled upon broad, 
shallow, white crockery dishes, sweet water grapes, carefully 
picked from the stem, stewed oysters, and a whitish, lumpy 
looking compound, unrecognizable by taste, but announced 
as chicken salad. This by a fashionable caterer from 
Baltimore. 

Owing to the thoughtfulness of the married ones among us, 
and by great exertion, some well known earthen necessities 
were procured. Our own band furnished music most delightful, 
playing the latest and most fashionable airs. On the whole, 
the affair was a great success ; revielle from the bugles in 
camp bringing the signal to disperse. 

31s. The non-commissioned officers, not to be outdone by 
their superiors in rank, have arranged, by permission, for a 
ball on New Year s Eve, and every spare man in camp is busied 
in preparation. 

Assistant Surgeon Thorndike, who both as officer and man 
has won the esteem and love of the whole command, has been 
commissioned as full Surgeon in the Massachusetts 39th, Col. 
Davis. His personal gain, from this promotion, don t at all 
reconcile us to our loss. 

We are making preparations to get rid of our cripples ; 
though red tape in large abundance hampers our every move 
ment to that end. Among them is included Schrock of " A," 
a " Veteran Recruit," procured at a money cost to the Govern 
ment of seven hundred dollars, who has been with us five weeks 
and has had six fits, without doing a single hour s duty since 
joining us. 

A new rule for the encouragement of the boys has been pro 
mulgated. It has been the custom for the officer of the day to 
select at guard mounting, each morning, from among those who 



RIPON. 159 

are most soldierly in their bearing, and whose dress and equip 
ments bear the best inspection, three men to be Orderlies at 
Headquarters. The new rule exempts from all guard duty for 
a fortnight such men as may be selected as such Orderlies, 
four times in a month. And this morning the Adjutant reports 
that eight men are enjoying the benefits of such exemption. 
As a whole, the regiment never made so perfect an appearance 
as now. 

Three more men leave us to-day for Washington, and the 
Examining Board. 

Piled near camp are three lines of wood, altogether amount 
ing to some three hundred cords, product of our muscle, mostly 
obtained from the estate, of a Mr. Lucas, who lives on a 
princely place near wt Halltown," which has been stripped of 
every rod of fence by the men of both armies in former years, 
and from which we have cut, and are now cutting, every 
growing tree. This wood is kept for the days when the rain 
and the mud will combine to prevent any use of our teams; 
and fatigue parties are now cutting and bringing into camp 
what suffices for actual daily consumption. 

The weather is just now intensely cold; and the General 
commanding is out of fuel ; the medical director is out of fuel ; 
A. A. G. Boone is out of fuel, and old Flagg, the Post 
Quartermaster, upon whom all these officers have made requis 
itions for fuel, hasn t a single spare stick on hand. Our pile is 
remembered, and a long train of Gov t wagons was driven into 
camp this morning, with the intent to raid upon our possessions. 
We are old enough in service, to get what we can, and good 
enough soldiers to keep what we get. So Flagg s train is 
turned about, and sent away empty. " Why, you ve got 
two hundred cords at least, in your camp ! " ( )h yes, more 
than that;" "and you Avon t let us have any?" "Not a 
stick ! " u Well then, you shall chop all the wood wanted at 
the post;" and so now comes an order for a detail of forty men, 
to cut wood for the Post Q. M.; which we can t help. 

4th. The weather is still intensely cold ; the wind blowing 
so fiercely as to make it impossible for the sentinel, on the 
parapet, to stand against it. 



160 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Our sick list is complicated by a case of scarlet fever. 

Lieut. Elwell, chief of our recruiting party, reports a total 
gain of forty men. Willard asks that Elwell may be informed 
he prefers to "give his men fits" instead of having them bring 
them with them. For the first time, an application of one of 
our men to be allowed to appear before the Examining Board, 
has been forwarded ^approved. The applicant came out as a 
Sergeant, was reduced to the ranks for intoxication after 
which he was promoted to corporal ; and now presents this 
application, approved by his captain, who is a thorough-going 
44 teetotaller." 

For the first time, too, since the organization of the regi 
ment, a coolness exists between the Col. Commanding Brigade, 
and the Lieut. Col. commanding the regiment. Cause as 
follows : 

While the Col. was on Court Martial in Cumberland, his 
orderly visited the camp, and stole from a member of his com 
pany, a sum of money, about thirty dollars. Of course, his 
arrest followed. Charges were preferred against him by his 
Captain, which were approved, and referred for trial to Major 
Pratt. Meanwhile the man was held in our guard house. 
Upon the return of the Col., which was by the mid-night train, 
he called loudly, but in vain, for his orderly. Learning his 
whereabouts and the cause of his absence, he wrote and sent 
down the following unofficial note : " Dear Col., I want my 
Orderly. Yours, G. D. W.;" to which was returned : " Dear 
Col., I ve got him ; when I m through with him, you can have 
him. Yours, W. S. L." An explanation followed, and the fact 
of the theft, arrest, and progress towards trial, was commun 
icated. Thereupon was issued the following : " Headquarters 
1st Brigade. In future, whenever charges are preferred against 
a man of the 34th Massachusetts Infantry, the same shall be 
referred to these Headquarters for consideration, and final 
disposition." k By order of Geo. D. Wells, Col. 34th Massa 
chusetts Infantry, Commanding Brigade." "S. F. Woods, A. 
A. A. G." 

This is serious ! Who is responsible for the command, its 



RTPOX. 161 

drill and discipline? the Lieut. Col. actually in command, or 
its nominal head, who is away, and exercising a distinct and 
separate authority? Would the Acting Brigadier presume to 
send such an order to Miner, of the Battery? or to Curtis, of the 
12th Virginia ? or would he submit to such interference were his 
situation reversed? These are questions demanding considera 
tion. A large detail from the regiment, under Maj. Pratt, and 
Lieuts. Macomber and Ammidon, is engaged in a thorough 
re-building of the road leading from Shenandoah street, past 
Camp Hill, to Bolivar, and beyond. To-day there isn t a soli 
tary man left in camp, liable to detail. 

Five more of our men are ordered to Washington, for exam 
ination as commissioned officers. 

A case has arisen to-day, which, calling for the action of the 
Regimental Commander, renders necessary a determination of 
the course to be adopted in reference to the Brigade Order, 
when charges are preferred against men of the 34th. To yield 
obedience, is to surrender a high duty, the prerogative of the 
.Regimental Commander ; to give control of the discipline of 
the regiment to an officer in no way accountable therefor ; to 
forfeit all claim to respect from others, and more than all else, 
to lose one s own self respect. Therefore, a letter was sent 
from Regimental Headquarters acknowledging receipt of the 
Brigade Order, protesting against its legality, and respectfully 
declining obedience. That done, an hour was given to Gen. 
Sullivan, who, with his wife, thoroughly inspected the camp. 
At a late hour of the day, the presence in camp, of Woods, A. 
A. A. G. was observed. He came with instructions to place 
the Lieut. Col. commanding under arrest, not to be executed 
however, if that officer would withdraw his refusal to obey the 
Brigade Order in question. This was declined, unless the 
order which called forth the refusal was first withdrawn, and 
so the matter now stands. Gen. Lockwood, commanding at 
Baltimore, has asked of the Department that the 34th may be 
ordered to that city, for provost duty. God shield us ! 

2th. Everything is progressing as usual. An unexpected 
visit to the camp was made to-day by Col. Wells. After a 
thorough inspection, he spoke in most complimentary terms 



162 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

of its appearance, the condition of the regiment, and the good 
conduct of the men at all times, arid on all duty. At leaving, 
in reference to the almost constant near presence of raiding 
parties of the enemy, he expressed a desire that the command 
should be " at all times kept ready to move at a moment s 
notice." No allusion whatever was made by him to the little 
existing unpleasantness between the heads of the respective 
Headquarters ; nor was there the most remote intimation given 
of any movement then ordered, or in contemplation. 

Judge then, with what surprise, shortly after taps, a request 
to report immediately at Brigade Headquarters was received; 
and upon reporting, to receive orders to draw rations for fifteen 
days, and 50,000 rounds of ball cartridges immediately. kt What, 
to-night, Colonel ! " " Yes, sir, to-night ; " and at a still later 
hour, to be told in person, "you will hold your command, Col., 
in readiness to move at a moment s notice." A written order 
sent down at 2 A. M., directed as follows : " Eight wall tents 
only will be allowed to the Field and Staff, and Line officers ; 
one wagon only for the transportation of all needed hospital 
tents and supplies, and Officers baggage. This last will be 
strictly confined to blankets and mess equipage." 

In striking contrast to this was the furnishing of Brigade 
Headquarters ; upon whose four four-horse teams were loaded 
mess-chests, trunks, chairs, bedsteads, feather-beds, and sheets, 
and a cooking-stove, besides something for the inner man, 
more appetizing than hardtack and coffee ! Under the direct 
supervision of Lieut. Henry -Bacon, Acting Quartermaster, the 
matter to be transported was suitably loaded ; a large supply of 
axes, picks, and shovels, being included. The command was 
turned out, and closely examined ; the able-bodied of the Guard 
relieved, and their places filled by those who would be liable to 
break down, and encumber the expedition. The strife among 
the men now was to see who might go ; not, who could stay 
behind. To leave our Sibley tents, with all their many con 
trivances for comfort, and to go out on a fifteen days march, in 
the middle of December, is no joke. Yet the men prefer it 
to being left. Dr. Thorndike, commissioned Field Surgeon 



RIPON. 163 

to the 39th Massachusetts, Lieut. Platt, Assistant Provost 
Marshall, Lieut. Horton, on duty at Division Headquarters, 
Capt. Pratt and Lieut. Lincoln, off duty, by reason of "Apho 
nia," and to whom the charge of the camp is to be committed ; 
Capt. Leach, on court martial, and Quartermaster Sergeant 
Trumbull are to remain behind. And so, our preparations are 
made. Now, 3 A. M., comes the order directing the movement 
at 7 A. M.; and, as it is made known to the Regiment, the shouts 
of " Hurrah for Baltimore ! v and " Bully for Washington ! " 
ring upon the air.

10th. Revielle roused us at an early hour, knapsacks were 
packed and breakfast eaten, and at five minutes before seven 
the regiment was in line, ready for the order " Forward." The 
12th Virginia reported in light marching order, and a delay was 
occasioned by the necessity of sending across the river for their 
blankets and "tents, d abri." The stampede of a part of Miner s 
horses occasioned still further delay, and it was not till half 
past eight o clock that the order to move was issued. The 34th 
led the column ; next came the battery, next a train of some 
forty wagons, the 12th Virginia closing the column, which 
stretched out nearly two miles long. Our route was through 
Bolivar, Halltown, arid Charlestown, over the scene of our 
October engagement with Imboden. At Charlestown, Boyd s 
1st New York Cavalry, and a section of the 1st (Furst s) Vir 
ginia Battery joined us. At near sundown we made our bivouac 
in a grove of oak wood, just outside of Berryville, the cavalry 
going on in advance. Our march this day was 19 miles. 

11 th. Off about 8 A. M., to-day, the 12th Virginia leading the 
column. Our route was through " Berryville," a place formerly 
of considerable pretension, but now with little signs of life, and 
none of business ; over a country where farm buildings were in 



VALLEY EXPEDITION. 165 

ruins ; where there were few fences arid no crops. Fording the 
" Opequan," with water about knee deep, we soon after made 
our noonday halt. Resuming our march, we soon came in sight 
of Winchester, and the breastworks thrown up on every emi 
nence by one or the other of the armies which in past time have 
occupied, or fought to gain possession of the place. Before en 
tering the town our left wing was detached, under Maj. Pratt, 
and with the drum corps and the U. S. Flag, moved as a sepa 
rate organization. But it s doubtful if anybody s eyes were 
blinded by the arrangement. And so, marching through the 
principal streets, by the Court House and other public build 
ings all scarred by the fire of contending armies where none 
but the negro population greeted our progress, we pitched our 
camp upon a field where our companions of the 12th had fought 
the summer before, under Milroy ; and where cast off equip 
ments lay mouldering, and bones of deceased soldiers lay whit 
ening in the sun. Capt. Soley had charge of our rear guard, 
and had the usual trouble incident to the duty of bringing up 
the stragglers of a column. Upon making his report, he was 
furnished a proper guard, with orders to close up one or two 
drinking saloons, the proprietors of which had disregarded his 
orders. He did his work effectually, confiscating and bring 
ing into camp a supply of knives, forks, cups, plates and spoons 
sufficient to establish Headquarters mess; and a small quantity 
of passably good whiskey, of which there was not a drop in 
the Regiment. Pickets were established, and under orders 
to resume the march at an early hour in the morning, we 
dropped asleep. 

12th. Our Bugles sounded the Revielle at 6.30A.M. Break 
fast was soon swallowed, and our men in line. But why the 
delay? In the raw cold of a December morning, men won t 
stand shivering in line, at least, without grumbling ! John 
Mack, driver of one of the Brigade wagons, was helplessly 
drunk. He had found Headquarters stores, and appropriated a 
part to his private use. So he was to be sent back ; a few men 
were also found unable to march farther, two only of whom were 
our*. A new issue of rations was made to the whole command, 
that wagons might be obtained in which to send back the 



166 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

disabled. This done, the column moved ; the 34th in 
advance. Passing over ground where Shields and Jackson had 
manceuvered and fought ; through " Newtown," and u Middle- 
town," small villages, whose poor, dilapidated buildings lined 
.long, ill-conditioned streets, at the corners of which stood 
grey-headed, gaunt-looking men and women; on on over the 
Mac-adamized pike, till, having forded " Cedar Creek," we 
went into camp, at 4.30 P. M., in thick woods, upon a hill to the 
east of, near to and overlooking the village of " Strasburg." 
Not a single able-bodied man had been seen during the day. 
Our march, the distance to be made each day, the places at, or 
near which we were to encamp nightly, had been directed, by 
orders from the " Trinity," (as Halleck, Stanton, and u Old 
Abe," are somewhat irreverently called,) previous to our 
starting; and at this place, in pursuance of orders from Head 
quarters, that same command at Washington, we are to remain 
encamped four long days. 

The Rebel General Rosser, with a force largely in excess of 
our own, laid against us, on the other side of the Shenandoah. 
Perhaps from this fact, our line of encampment was frightfully 
extended. As the troops were well covered from observation 
by the woods, from our bivouac fires alone could any idea of 
our strength be "gained. Our pickets were well out in all 
directions ; beyond the circle of which, no one was allowed to go. 
No hindrance was offered to the coming into camp of such as 
might desire to visit us ; but, " once in, stay in," was the order. 
Previous to the march, Captains Bacon and Soley, Lieut. Kin- 
nicut, and the Lieutenant Colonel commanding, had been 
boarding at a private house in the Ferry, and the orders to 
march were so peculiar in the manner of delivery, that no 
arrangement for subsistence upon the expedition could be made; 
so that up to this time, those officers had lived upon charity. 
While awaiting the return of some men, sent out to make pur 
chases, a present of some "grouse and buffalo meat" was sent up 
to Regimental Headquarters, for supper ; and it was none the 
less relished, that the meat of the first was white, and tender, 
with a flavor very like chicken ; and that the taste of the latter 
was much like veal ! The return of the foragers with liberal 



VALLEY EXPEDITION. 167 

supplies of milk, butter, bread, turkies, and sheep, put the 
above named four 011 their feet, so far as commissariat was 
concerned. But the tables were turned at Brigade Headquar 
ters, where, notwithstanding all their appliances of bedsteads, 
beds, sheets, chairs, and cooking stoves, the officers were living 
on short rations of hams and hardtack. The Pioneers were 
detailed to cut wood, which the drummer boys were set to 
bring in, and pile in a heap, for the fires, round which most of 
the officers gathered. 

\?&gt;th. The morning is chilly, with indications of rain. 
Extended as we were yesterday, the order to-day is to k * stretch 
our lines still farther."" We are all occupied in preparations to 
keep comfortable for the days we are to remain here. The men 
are suffering a good deal from badly blistered feet, but there, is 
no complaining. wt Boyd " is scouting our front, and has sent in 
a considerable number of prisoners for us to guard. 

14th. The storm which had threatened, broke upon us last 
night with fury. Rain, snow, and wind combined to make (im 
position uncomfortable, though the thick cedars and pines 
which screen us from observation, also afford us partial pro 
tection from the severity of the weather. 

Orders from Headquarters direct the 34th to furnish a 
guard of fifteen, to be detailed from the "poorest, lamest, deadest, 
men" of the command, who are to be sent back to the Ferry, 
as guard over the prisoners now in our keeping, numbering 
over ninety. 

Many a man, with sore and swollen feet, pleads hard to be 
allowed to remain with the column; and the final detail was 
governed, quite as much by the morale of the men, as by their 
physical condition. 

~L5th. " Contrabands * throng the camp, with wild stories 
of the movements of Averill, who is raiding near "Saltville;" 
and to create a diversion in favor of whom, our column is mov 
ing. Refugees from Rebel conscription, from their hiding- 
places in the mountains, in considerable numbers, and some 
residents near by also, come in, seeking safe conduct to our 
lines under the protection of our column. 

The train is to be repacked, that wagons may be procured in 



168 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

which our prisoners and guard can be transported to the 
"Ferry;" and huge piles of hard tack, in boxes, are stacked in 
camp, exposed to the rain, which has poured now for thirty-six 
hours in a continuous stream. 

. We resume our march to-morrow, taking with us six days 
rations of bread, and three only of pork, the men being put on 
half rations . We carry only thirty out of the 50,000 rounds of 
ball cartridges with which we started, and are light enough to 
move quickly if we are driven to it. I could not help enjoying 
myself to-day at the condition of things at Brigade Headquar 
ters, where I had been ordered to report. Their mess was 
reduced to hard tack and ham, and the wry faces of the members, 
as the Quartermaster dismounted from a foraging expedition he 
had undertaken for their relief, bearing under his arm a peacock 
as the only trophy of his raid, were funny enough. Our OAVU 
larder, at the time, was amply supplied with live sheep and tur 
keys, besides mutton and chickens, sufficient for several days, 
and I made merry at their expense. 

Returning to my own quarters, I found a group of officers 
anxious to obtain permission for their servants to leave the col 
umn, on to-morrow s march, for the purpose of procuring sup 
plies. To their request, I could only point to the order of the 
day, just issued from Brigade Headquarters, " forbidding any 
wt soldier to leave the column on any pretext," and directing the 
officers " to shoot any man who should be found away, attempt- 
" ing to approach, with the purpose of entering, any house upon 
" the route." " But what shall I do, Col. ? My mess hasn t a 
mouthful to eat! " " Wait, Capt. ! The Col. don t know that 
I have any supplies. I ll make the same request for myself. 
If it is granted, he can t very well refuse you ; if it is refused, I 
will share with you of my abundance." So my note was dis 
patched at once, and was brought back by the Orderly, who 
carried it, with the following endorsement: "Respectfully 
" returned, disapproved. Lieut. Col. Lincoln s attention is 
" called to orders Brig. Headquarters this date, prohibiting any 
" man s leaving the column, on the march. Commanding offi- 
u cers of separate Battalions and Batteries will be held to the 
" most exact personal responsibility for the observance of the 



V A LL K V K X I K I ) IT I &lt; ) N . 1 fi 9 

" above order." With a smile, I threw the paper to the Cap 
tain. T was better for him to take a carcass of mutton from 
my store than to indulge in grumbling; and, shouldering his 
meat, he started off. 

16A. Our original order had directed us to move, bv 
prescribed marches to " Strasbnrg," (where we now are,) to 
remain there four days; then to resume the advance up ilie 
valley, by similarly prescribed marches, reaching Harrisonburg 
on the 18th; to hold that place till noon on the 19th, avoiding 
a fight if possible, and this done, to return to the Ferry. Upon 
reaching Strasburg, report of the threatening position of the 
Rebel Gen. Rossers command on our flank, had been made, 
but produced no change in our orders; so, through the 
drenching rain, which still continued to fall, the boys moved 
on to line, at half past seven, and soon after, the bugles 
sounded " forward," the 34th taking its turn in the rear. Our 
route, still upon the Mac-adam was without obstructions, save 
such as were caused by gullies, down which the water rushed, 
often, up to the knees of the men. 

We reached " Woodstock " by the middle of the afternoon, 
the day s march, about twelve miles. The train was carefully 
parked; artillery placed in position for any emergency ; strong 
pickets thrown out, completely girdling us, and more than 
usual precaution taken against surprise. Where is Rosser? and 
what will he do ? are questions of considerable interest to all 
of us. 

Vltli. The wind changed in the night, and this morning 
blows pierceingly cold, from the north-west. At half past 
seven, without beat of drum, or blast of bugle, the men moved 
on to line, ready for the inarch. The scenes of the morning, 
though sad, were amusing enough. Everything had been 
thoroughly soaked in the rain of yesterday, and, upon reaching 
camp, all hands had turned their energies to drying themselves, 
their clothing and equipments. Some taking off their boots, or 
shoes, had placed them by the fires to dry ; and now found them 
a "world too small;" others had laid down with their feet to the 
tire, and so the leather had been scorched to a crisp. Officers, 
magnificent in their long legged and stylish boots, were hunt 
ing for privates with whom to exchange for the regulation 



170 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

shoe ; and all, of whatever rank, unable to trade for shoes of 
size large enough to slip over their blistered and swollen feet, 
slit the uppers, from instep to toe, or cut out the whole front 
of the shoe leather. Many of large understanding, wrapped 
their sore feet in bandages made of pieces torn from their 
shelter tents, or woolen blankets. With all these discourage 
ments, the column cheerfully limped along its difficult road. 
The rain, of the preceding days, had washed from the Pike 
all dust and loose dirt, and the sharp grit of its frozen surface, 
wore away the soles of our shoes, as a rasp would wear away 
paper. " Jordan was a hard road to trabble." The spirit of 
good natured rivalry between the men of the two Infantry 
commands, was such, that neither would falter, and, from one 
or the other, could always be heard the merry jest or patriotic 
song. "Co boss ! Co boss ! " in allusion to the bounty of "seven 
hundred dollars and a cow" as the boys said, our old veterans 
Avould call out to a faltering recruit, less inured than them 
selves to fatigue and hardship ; but generally there was little 
opportunity for such good natured crowing. All bore themselves 
gallantly, and many unflinchingly trod the rough pathway 
with bare and bleeding feet. 

Passing through " Edinboro," a place of small consequence, 
AVC halted for the night, at " Mt. Jackson," (a neat village of 
some pretension), going into camp in a piece of thick woods, 
on a hill, in rear of some large hospital buildings, erected after 
the first Bull Hun, and near the unfenced burial ground 
attached thereto, where swine were rooting over, and tossing 
about the head boards which had marked the last resting place 
of representatives from nearly every state in the Union. 

Sending forward a Cavalry picket of two Companies from 
Boyd s command, which now kept but little in advance, to hold 
the bridge which spanned the north fork of the Shenandoah, 
just the other side the village, we prepared to pass the night. 

To-day s march showed us that every live animal had been 
driven before our advance by the inhabitants near our route. 

An incident, which occurred during a temporary halt to-day, 
strongly illustrates the accuracy with which one familiar with 
moving bodies of troops, can estimate the strength of a column. 
Ever since since leaving " Strasburg," the females, who came to 



VALLEY EXPEDITION. 171 

the doors to gaze upon us, had been eloquent with scoffs and 
jeers, and full of prophecies that we were marching a road over 
which we should not be able to return. Rumor preceding 
us, gave our number as twenty-five thousand strong ; and, as 
we halted for a brief rest, a young, scornful-looking damsel, 
standing in a doorway, was heard, in reply apparently to a 
question asked of her, by an inmate of the house, to say : " Well? 
44 if there is over seventeen hundred of them, I won t reckon 
"again." We actually numbered seventeen hundred and 
forty-two. 

Another incident was full of excitement. Attached to the 
person of the Commander of the column was a party of about 
twenty mounted men, mostly from Cole s Battalion of Maryland 
Cavalry, under a grim old Sergeant of Boyd s 1st New York. 
While out scouting on our flank, these fellows flushed a party 
which, under a dashing young Lieutenant of Fitz Hugh Lee s 
command, had came down to bushwhack us. Our party was the 
strongest, and the Rebels sought safety in flight. Selecting the 
Lieutenant for his victim, the old Sergeant pushed closely on 
his track. The chase, with its windings and doublings was 
in plain view from the elevated road along which we were 
moving. Once or twice the old Sergeant raised his pistol, as if 
fearful of losing his man; but, resisting the temptation to fire, 
he steadily pressed on, at last making him prisoner, at a high 
rail fence, up to which the Lieutenant boldly rode, but over 
which he was unable to force his beast. No words can properly 
describe the peculiar air of satisfaction with which the old Ser 
geant turned his captive over to us for safekeeping; and, after 
exchanging saddles, galloped away upon the back of the animal 
he had so gallantly ridden down. 

18th. The attack upon and disaster to our Cavalry picket, 
at the bridge across the Sheriandoah last night, was made 
known to us at an early hour this morning, by Capt. Stearns, 
who commanded the party, and who was fortunate in making 
his escape. His party had been surprised, with a loss of fifteen 
men and twenty-six horses. It seemed almost a necessity that 
the bridge should be held by us, as the current was swift and 
deep, and the banks high ; but we were too weak, especially in 
Cavalry, to spare a sufficient force to ensure its being held. 



172 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

So, with ti warning to the Villagers, that they would be held 
responsible in person and property for its preservation, we 
moved, leaving it unguarded. The 34th was again in the rear, 
having in charge about one hundred prisoners, all of whom had 
been captured and sent in to us by Boyd s command, since 
leaving Strasburg. 

Reaching New Market, we came to a halt in the main street, 
which extended the whole length of the Village. Nothing 
indicated the existence of war, but the entire absence of able 
bodied males. There was no lack of aged men and women, 
and young children of both sexes, between whom and " the 
boys" many a jest was exchanged; and the belief, not always 
good naturedly, expressed that we should not be able to march 
back, over the same route. The prisoners indulged in loud 
boastings that the tables would be turned upon us, and they 
soon be guarding us with our own muskets. Indeed, on all 
sides could be heard the confident assertions that we were 
marching to certain defeat. 

As we neared Harrisonburg, a halt was ordered, while our 
commander communicated his orders for the disposition of the 
troops, during the night. This done, surrounded by his staff 
and body guard, he put spurs to his horse and galloped, out of 
sight, to the front. Marching on, at almost sundown, we 
reached our designated camping ground, in a dense wood, to 
the left of the pike, almost a mile outside of the Village. 

The Artillery being posted, with Infantry in proper support 
ing position, arms were stacked, and the men ordered to prepare 
their coffee. A large body were at once detailed to cut down 
trees, and another and larger one to roll them together, for our 
bivouac fires. The weather was intensely cold. Its. severity 
may be judged from the fact, that, at this time, almost every 
man s canteen had become useless ; the water in them, having 
frozen hard enough to split them open. The work of prepar 
ing for our fires was interrupted by an Orderly, who brought 
orders to our Lieut. Col., directing him " to get under arms, and 
hold the column ready to move at a moment s notice." Quietly 
the orders were promulgated ; and the line was quickly formed. 
What did it all mean? We were left to conjecture, for no far 
ther communication reached us. Standing inactive, the cold was 



VALLKV EXPEDITION. 173 

hard to bear, and was fast reducing us to an unserviceable con 
dition. Now, our A. A. A. G., who had accompanied the Col. 
commanding on his ride to the front, and had conferred with 
Boyd, of the Cavalry, came in, giving us the information that we 
had nearly run into the arms of the Rebel General Early, who, 
having failed in his attempt to intercept Averill on his retreat, 
had turned his attention to our column. As but a few miles in 
tervened between us and his command, and, as it would be folly 
for our small body to attempt to contend with his full corps, we 
concluded that our hurried retreat would be ordered. Rut no 
orders came to us, and as by this time the severe cold was 
telling upon the men, arms were again stacked axes dis 
tributed and while some were chopping, others, and a larger 
party, Avere engaged in rolling into huge piles, the fallen logs 
and limbs ; the object being to build a long line of fires, under 
cover of which, to slip off, if, as was conjectured, such should 
be the final determination of our leader. Our situation now 
became generally known, and the Boys worked with a will 
till they had rolled together a long line of log heaps. 

Riding on to the ground, and catching at a glance the appar 
ent disobedience of his orders, in that the men were not in line, 
the Acting Brigadier, in no very measured language, demanded 
an explanation? "A statement of what was being done, was 
received, with thanks for the conception, and execution of the 
idea ; and a direction that it should be carried to completion/ 
That done, Col., said he, " you will get the column under arms, 
move out on to the Pike, without delay ; set your face towards 
the ferry, and, mind, unless you see me, or get a note, which 
you can swear is in my hand- writing, do ii t you stop, till you 
get to the ferry, for now, Col., it s legs or Litiby" 

The huge piles of logs, extending in long line, were quickly 
fired, and between 7 and 8 P. M., after a day s march of twenty- 
three miles, encumbered with our prisoners, and a number of 
families who hoped, under the protection of our column to 
reach the Union lines, in the cold and the darkness we 
commenced our retreat. The 34th in its turn had the advance. 
The Colonel joined us before we "had been long on the road, arid 
his sharp "Forward, boys!" uttered as he rode past to the 
head, imparted renewed life to the column.

CHAPTER XVIII. 



VALLEY EXPEDITION, 
AN INCIDENT OUR NIGHT S MARCH EDINBORO A HALT 

AND IMPORTANT INFORMATION THE ROAD IS CLEAR 

BIVOUAC AT WINCHESTER WELL, HALT NOW ! HOME 

AGAIN A PUNISHMENT MORE INCIDENTS. 

An incident of the day s march is too interesting not to be 
given. Among our prisoners we had a Lieutenant of Fitz 
Hugh Lee s command, a smart young fellow, with a bright new 
uniform; the same, who, driven from the arnbush from which 
he had intended to bushwhack us, had been run down by our 
grizzley old Sergeant of New York Cavalry. On the day s 
march a temporary halt had been ordered ; the head of the 34th 
resting just opposite a house, some little way, back to the 
left, from the pike. "I m right glad it ain t so! I m right 
glad it ain t so ! " uttered in a loud tone, broke upon our 
ears ; and turning, we saw a tall, gaunt, gray-headed old man, 
with uncovered head, and hat swinging in accompaniment 
to his exclamation, striding toward us. Repulsed in his at 
tempt to pass the line of sentinels which fenced in the pris 
oners, he appealed to the Officer of the Guard, and by him 
was referred to the Lieut. Col. Commanding. His request to 
be allowed to pass the Guard and speak with one of our 
prisoners, was denied. " But he is the only boy left to my old 
age, and he left home only yesterday!" "No matter!" 
" Well, Colonel, where did you come from ? " " Massachu 
setts." "Massachusetts! Massachusetts! from what part?" 
" Worcester." " Worcester ? God bless the old county ! 
There s where Jwas born; I came from Dudley; my name is 



VALLEY EXPEDITION. 175 

Baker ; Pm a Union man ; my oldest boys are in your army, 
(that is, if they are alive ; for I ve heard nothing from them 
since I run them through the lines), and now, you ve got the 
youngest. I wanted to run him off, too ; but his old mother 
could not part with him, so I got him detailed to help me on 
my farm, to get him rid of the conscription. But they gave 
him a Lieutenant s commission, and so got him away from me. 
And when, he heard you were coming up this way, nothing 
would do him but he must go out to meet you. We, his old 
mother and I, plead hard against it, but we couldn t stop him. 
So I gave him my best mare, and he got some boys together 
and rode off; and when I saw one of your men this morning 
riding by on " old Blaze Face," (I knew the mare to oncet,) 
I reckoned it was all up with the boy. But you ve got him 
among your prisoners, and for the sake of his old mother, for 
love of the old State ! let me to him, Colonel ! The appeal 
was successful. 

Rushing past the guard, the old man hurried on, with out 
stretched arms, exclaiming, with broken voice, " Hulloa, John ! 
" How did this happen? I thought twas all up with you when 
"I saw old Blaze Face going by this morning! I knew the 
" critter right off ! And, John, they told me you was killed ! 
" but I m glad it ain t so ! I in right glad you are here. You 
"mustn t feel so smart, boy! you mustn t feel so smart! 
" These Yankees are pretty cute, too ! " 

" Yes, damn it ! father," broke in John, " the Yanks have got 
" me now. I thought the critter could run away from any 
" Yankee horse that ever was foaled ; but, curse them, they 
" were too fast for her ; and they ve got me, and the mare, too ! 
" But never mind ; they can t take me out of the Valley ! I in 
" a prisoner now, but they won t keep me long ! " 

The old man s request to be permitted to take his boy up 
home, that lie might take leave of his mother, and get a change 
of clothes, and some provisions, was refused, with the remark 
" that he would have the same rations as our men had, and that 
u his mother saw him yesterday ! " " Yes ; but Col., hard bread 
" isn t as good as soft biscuit! and his old mother s heart is most 
" broken for her baby. Let him go, Col., for the sake of the old 



176 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" flag which my boys are fighting under ! You need n t fear ; 
"I 11 bring him to you again, sure!" Knowing well the risk, 
yet somehow feeling confident all would turn out right, he was 
allowed to take him ; yet not without the accompaniment of a 
faithful guard. 

Minutes passed, and the prisoner didn t show ! " Forward !" 
was sounded from the bugles, and still there was no appearance ; 
but, as the head of the regiment neared his home, our prisoner, 
provided with a good large bundle, with his father and the guard, 
awaited our approach. The prisoner, as he stepped within the 
guard, turned, and, with an air of bravado, said : u Never, mind, 
old man ! Don t fret ! I 11 be home again in a day or two ! " 
" God bless and keep you, Col. ! " said the father, u you and your 
" brave boys. Keep my loy safe ! You ve got him, and all I 
" ask is, that you ll keep him till the end of the war ; " and, 
wringing his hands, the old man turned away, partly, perhaps, 
to hide the tears which were streaming down his face. 

It is an interesting fact, that the young man, upon our return 
to the Ferry, was delivered to the provost guard there, was 
confined afterwards at Ft. Warren, and was not liberated till 
hostilities closed. 

We found butter here at seventy-five cents the pound, small 
sized loaves of bread seventy-five cents each; whiskey ten 
dollars a quart; corn six dollars the bushel. Cassard our 
Brigade Commissary, sold the hides, from two two-year old 
steers, for fifty dollars. Matches were sold by the men, at two 
dollars the card; and one man refused one hundred and sixty 
dollars for his boots; but this last price was in Confederate bills. 
After leaving Strasburg, the men were on half rations. We 
carried nothing but grain, for our horses ; which, for seven days, 
had no other forage. 

Monday 19A. Our last night s march was one which none of 
us will ever forget. We had marched twenty-three miles to 
reach Harrisonburg. This, in broad day, when one could choose 
the path for his sore and blistered feet, was bad enough ; but, 
in the darkness of the night, no one could choose his road, and 
it was literally true that our night s march could have been 
tracked by the bloody footprints of the men. In spite of all 



VALLEY EXPEDITION". 177 

this, however, it was conducted swiftly ; and, but for the dull 
rumbling of the wagons and artillery, not a sound proceeded 
from the column, except when an occasional misstep drew 
a suppressed oath from the poor sufferer, or a smothered com 
mand was passed from officer, to officer, along the column. We 
reached "New Market." at 4 A. M.,and, filing on to a hill over 
looking the Village, stacked our arms. Permission was here 
given the men to light their pipes and kindle fires. Poor fellows ! 
they were too tired to care for either; and except such as were 
detailed for the night picket, all laid down, and slept upon the 
ground they occupied, in line. All were not permitted to enjoy 
this rest, however, for upon the complaint of a citizen, Dr. 
Ilinckle, that men from the Artillery were breaking open and 
plundering stores, a Patrol from the 34th was marched into the 
Village to put an end to the outrages complained of. 

Morning dawned all too quickly ; and at 8 A. M. we were 
again in motion ; the 12th Virginia, which prided itself especially 
upon its powers of marching, leading the way. In the anxiety, 
lest we were pursued by Early, all make good use of their 
legs. We passed u Mt. Jackson ; " reached " Edinboro " in 
good season in the afternoon ; and having encamped in order of 
battle, in case of being overtaken and attacked before morning, 
breathed more freely. 

Here, in the evening, Boyd joined us with his cavalry ; 
expressing great admiration for what he laughingly called our 
" unbounded capability for retreating" He had been left at 
Harrisonburg, with orders to keep up our fires, and conceal, as 
effectually as he could, and as long as possible, our departure. 
His force had been driven into H. before we left; and, during 
the night, he abandoned the town, falling back so as to cover 
our intended camp. The account he gave of his own, and the 
rebels movements the morning after we left, amused us greatly. 
The smoke, still rising from our long line of fires, betrayed our 
supposed position. Throwing out a long line of skirmishers, the 
enemy began a cautious advance. By skilfully manumvring, 
now showing a line dismounted, now appearing in column, 
Boyd caused them to halt. A careful reconnoisance was made 
by the enemy ; his line of skirmishers was strengthened ; and 



178 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

about 11 A. M., it gallantly charged, and captured our smoulder 
ing fires. Boyd s purpose being accomplished, he gathered his 
small force, and galloped sharply after us. 

Tuesday, 20th. The order of march, issued last night, directed 
a movement at three, A. M. As we, having moved on to the 
Pike, were waiting for the train and artillery, many and vari 
ous speculations were indulged in by men and officers. Was 
Early after us ? and if so, could he out-march us ? Was Rosser 
in our front ? From the 12th Virginia could be heard, " Can 
the 34th keep out of the way ? " for it was our turn to lead. 

Our night s march had given us an advantage in the race, 
which all felt was to be engaged in. If only we could maintain 
what we had gained ! ! 

We reached " Woodstock " at sharp day-break. " Halt ! " 
was ordered in the main street of the town. The iron axle of 
one of our wagons had broken short off, at the shoiilder, and 
our Col., like a good soldier as he was, determined to leave 
nothing for the enemy. So the 34th was called upon for black 
smiths; while the B. Q. M. rode up and down the village 
searching for a forge, at which the axle could be welded. The 
men leaned upon their muskets, in the street ; and the officers 
grouped together upon the sidewalks. As I stood, having dis 
mounted to stamp some warmth into my feet, I was rudely 
jostled by a female, who approached unperceived from my rear, 
and passed hurriedly on. The force with which she struck 
me, precluded the idea that the collision was accidental. Who 
was she ? and what did she mean ? These questions were 
puzzling me, when I perceived that she had turned in her walk, 
and was retracing her steps. Her course was directly towards 
me. I braced myself for the meeting. Another step, and she 
would be square against me. But, with a side step, she brushed 
past ; her hand caught mine, and, by a dexterous manipulation, 
she left in rny grasp, a piece of paper, folded closely. With no 
sign of recognition, she pursued her way ; and turning the cor 
ner of a street, near by, passed out of sight. This was queer 
enough ! I moved away some distance, before I ventured to 
look at the note. The paper was without signature, or date ; 
but it gave information of the whereabouts of Rosser, and of his 



VALLEY EXPEDITION. 170 

then hurried march to intercept us. Springing to my horse s 
back, I gave the note into the Col. s hands, with a statement 
of how I came in possession of it. 

" Send your Pioneers here, Colonel, and cut and burn this 
wagon ! " was his order, as he read the note. This accom 
plished, our march was resumed. During this halt, a few hard 
looking, middle-aged men glared at us, from the corners of the 
streets ; and, as the column filed from the ground where it 
halted for breakfast, a party of about forty fired a few shots 
upon our rear guard. One of " Furst s " Napoleons, well 
charged with grape and cannister, sent back our compliments, 
and we were troubled no more. 

At near noon, we approached Strasburg. The note, so strange 
ly delivered at Woodstock, warned us of danger here. So, 
halting at Fisher s Hill, our scouts were pushed out in front, and 
on flank. Slowly and cautiously we followed. The head of " the 
narrows " was reached, and again we halted, to give time for a 
thorough observation in front. Hurrah ! the road is clear ! ! 
Catching the signal that there was no enemy to dispute our 
advance, with lightened hearts, and quickened step, we passed 
through Strasburg, and at 1 P. M., re-occupied the camp, we had 
formed on our march up the valley. 

Two miles in front was Cedar Creek. Once across that, all 
felt there would be safety. As we must get wet in fording it, 
the men desired to cross it at once, that they might have the 
advantage of their bivouac fires at which to dry their clothes, 
rather than to cross to-morrow morning with a day s march, in 
wet clothing, before them. But the Col. commanding wouldn t 
listen to the suggestion. 

The men had been 011 half rations, since leaving this camp. 
Leave was granted to issue the reserved rations, which amounted 
to eight hard tack, and a goodly sized piece of bacon, per man ; 
all of which was speedily disposed of. The horses too, which 
had been confined to short allowance of grain, for the same 
time, now enjoyed long forage, which was dealt out to them. 

Scattered around, lay the carcasses of a number of cows, 
killed, as the villagers insisted, by having eaten greedily of the 
" hard tack" we had left on the ground, when marching away. 



180 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Pickets were thrown out as before, but now, free communica 
tion was allowed to the country people, many of whom came 
in, toting" their little all, with a fixed determination of leaving 
the valley with us. 

2Ls-. Our march was resumed early this morning; the 12th 
Virginia heading the column, and leading off at a pace which 
kept our teams to a pretty steady trot. Upon reaching " Cedar 
Creek," it was found that our prisoners, with their Guard (a 
Company of the 12th,) were behind, in the village of Strasburg. 
A halt was of course necessary till they could be brought up, 
and turned over to Company " F," of ours, Capt. Chandler, 
whose turn it was to take charge of them. 

The weather was very severe ; a cold north-east wind swept 
across the level, and blew up clouds of dust which enveloped the 
column. We halted at noon, for dinner, in the village of " Mid- 
dletown ; " and, marching with a quick step through " Win 
chester," went into bivouac in the wood, by the banks of the 
" Opequan." A supply train of wagons, with medical stores, 
and ambulances with Surgeons, met us just before we reached 
" Winchester." Reports had reached the Ferry of serious 
disaster to the column ; not only by reason of exposure to the 
extreme severity of the weather, but also in consequence of an 
encounter with the Rebels ; and relief in this shape was sent 
forward to us. Seated round our camp fires, we listened to the 
wonderful accounts of our exploits, which had reached those in 
authority ; and were none the less contented, that there was so 
little foundation for the most of them. The evening passed 
merrily I A shot fired upon one of our pickets, on the " Win 
chester" side, causing us to spring to our arms, disturbed our 
repose for a moment ; but other than this, " all went merry as a 
" marriage bell." 

24:th. Orders, issued last night, directed " one Company of 
" the 34th to be sent forward at an early hour, to throw a foot 
"bridge across the Opequan; " and Company "B," Capt. Potter, 
was detailed for the work, with directions to move at 3 A. M. 

At 4.30 A. M., the 34th led the column, on what was felt to 
be the last day s march. The water was high in the creek, 
with a body of thin ice extending some distance from the bank. 



VALLEY EXPEDITION. 181 

The troops crossed upon the rude bridge of logs, which Capt. 
P. s men were finishing when we came up ; and ascending the 
steep bank, there halted for the train. Our horses were all 
smooth shod ; and the water, which froze as it dripped from 
the animals and vehicles, rendered the task of climbing the hill 
slow, and difficult. The men were impatient in their long 
waiting in the cold ; and when, at length, the Bugler sounded 
"forward," Capt. Willard, whose Company formed the advance 
guard, led off, rapidly. One, two, and three miles were passed 
over, in the exact time of sixteen, seventeen, and sixteen and a 
half minutes each, when, sounding faintly from the rear came 
the " halt," and the Colonel commanding rode up, laughingly 
enquiring, "if we were running away." "Oh, no, Colonel," 
was the reply, " but you know the 12th boast that they have 
"never met troops who could march fast enough&gt;for them; 
" and we are trying to please them ! " " Well! halt now," said 
he, " and let them get up, and say how they like it, so far ! " 
We breakfasted near " Berryville ;" passed through "Charles- 
town at noon, where we dropped Furst with his Artillery ; 
(Boyd having been left at " Winchester,") and marched on to 
line, in our own camp, at 4 p. M., bringing with us, ninety-eight 
prisoners, besides a goodly number of refugees, and contrabands, 
with their families. The conduct of the men of the 34th, for 
the whole time, was worthy of the highest praise. 

Once only, during the expedition, was there an occasion for 
punishment in the regiment. Upon our return march, a Ser 
geant of ours left the column, with the purpose of entering a 
house, in disobedience of orders. For this offence the stripes 
were torn from his blouse, he was marched in arrest for the rest 
of the day, and at night, regimental special order sent him to 
duty, as a private, in the ranks. It is due him, however, to say 
that his previous conduct, as a warrant officer, was unexception 
able, and that he was led to this act of disobedience by his sym 
pathy for a comrade, who, being sick, desired to obtain some 
soft bread for the hard tack issued to him. 

As a military movement, this expedition was hazardous enough 
to be termed fool-hardy. To attempt, in the dead of winter, to 
penetrate, with a column of 1,700 men of all arms, the enemy s 
15 



182 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

country, to a distance of more than 100 miles, cutting away 
from a base of supplies, with no hope for support, would be suf 
ficiently venturesome under the most favorable circumstances. 
What shall be said of such a movement when, as in this case, the 
order of march, the day for starting, the distance to be passed 
over each day, the four days tarrying in encampment, midway 
of the advance, are all prescribed by Headquarters far distant 
from the scene of the movement, where neither the nature of 
the weather, nor the obstacles to be encountered, could by any 
possibility have been foreseen. 

To have successfully accomplished the movement, escaping 
from a force of ten times our number, without the loss of a man, 
bringing with us every prisoner, and encumbered by a cloud of 
refugees, evinced a skill, and endurance, and pluck, not always 
heretofore exhibited by our troops. Had Rosser, whom we 
left on our flank, succeeded in crossing the Shenandoah, and so 
fallen upon our rear, or laid in wait to oppose our retreat, the 
result would not have been so favorable. But he was prevented 
from crossing by the high water in the river ; and when at 
length he did move to cut off our return, our night s march 
down the Valley had been so rapid as to bring us in advance of 
him. 

During the entire route, every person with whom we could 
hold communication, according to his predilection, expressed the 
hope, or fear, that we were marching to certain defeat and cap 
ture. The prisoners were entirely unconcerned at their situa 
tion ; bantering their guard by confident assurances that, in a day 
or two, the tables would be turned, and they be holding our 
own muskets over our heads. More especially was this true on 
our hurried homeward march ; and each grove and pass, every 
ford and bridge, was closely searched by them, as if from out of 
each their deliverance was to be effected. 

The loyal among the inhabitants gave us hearty welcome. 
The contrabands flocked to our camp by night, in some instances 
communicating information of importance ; and such of them as 
accompanied us in (and but from the fact that we could not well 
stop on our return, the number of these would have been much 
larger) were extravagant in their demonstrations of joy. 



VALLEY EXPEDITION. 183 

Many refugees from the ruthless conscription of the Rebel 
officers, hurried from their hiding places to the protection of 
our flag. 

No one who was near can ever forget the feeling caused in 
our ranks by the loud cries and wild yells of a party of these 
people, who, in this way tried to attract our attention, hoping to 
reach our column. With no covering for their heads, or feet, 
their bodies but partially protected by wet, torn and dirty quilts, 
their long hair hanging down over their faces, unshaven, half 
starved, they staggered up to us, tears streaming from their 
eyes, and prayer and thanksgiving pouring from overflowing 
hearts. One could hardly conceive of such misery. 

On our upward march, before reaching Strasburg, there was 
an amount of pillaging which would have done honor to Gilmer 
or Mosby, but which was disgraceful to a disciplined command. 

A cavalry scout would dash up to the column, enveloped by 
a lot of turkeys, geese and hens, tied to every spare point of sad 
dle or trapping, followed by a second, flourishing a steel square, 
or a pair of steelyards in his hand, and wearing a woman s bon 
net over his cap ; while a third held in his arms a kettle of apple 
sauce, smoking hot, as it was snatched from the fire, or a loaf of 
bread, taken half baked, from the oven. The caissons of Miner s 
Artillery revealed looking glasses, feather pillows, and articles 
of wearing apparel of no use save to persons of the other sex. 

All this was stopped, however, by the General Order issued 
before leaving Strasburg, which forbid any soldier leaving the 
column while on the march, and entering any house, under 
penalty of being shot ; and thenceforth fear kept these rag-a- 
muffins decent. 

To us of the shoulder straps, there was privation enough. 
Bread was one dollar the loaf, small at that, and not always to 
be had at any price. No one on the route would sell an 
article of any kind, for any price, to a d d Yankee nigger, as 
these people called our black servants. The men fared better, 
as their rations were regularly issued ; arid moreover, they 
could always trade away to the people their coffee grounds for 
bread. Through the whole expedition the men were in heavy 
inarching order ; a portion of the time on half rations, many 



184 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

without shoes, and marching in stockings ; others with feet but 
partially protected by bandages made from strips of their 
blankets or shelters, and leaving the bloody footprints of their 
swollen and blistered feet upon the frozen pathway ; and in 
such condition accomplishing a night march of twenty-one 
miles, resting only an hour and a half, immediately upon one of 
twenty-three the preceding day, and all this without a straggler. 
Gilmer and McNeil hung round us during the trip, but with 
no disastrous results, if the loss sustained by the Cavalry 
Picket at the bridge, near Mt. Jackson, is excepted.

No duty was required from the men, from the hour of 
their return yesterday, till parade this evening, the call for 
which gave the first intimation to them of the intention to have 
them out. Stiff and lame as most of the men were, their march 
was not so springy as usual ; but on line they were the same 
soldiers as ever, their arms glittering in all their customary 
splendor, and the manual being perfection itself. One thing, 
only, marred the beauty and pride of the parade. Lieut. D. 
had so far forgotten what was due to himself, and the regiment, 
as an officer, as to appear on line in a state of intoxication, for 
which offence he was at once placed in arrest. Capt. Chandler 
of F, has received a leave of absence for fifteen days. Major 
Pratt is detailed on General Court Martial. 

ZSth. Col. Wells has left for Cumberland, having been 
detailed as a member of a General Court Martial to assemble 
there. 

We shall lose one man from K, in consequence of the hard 
ship and exposure of our late expedition. He made no com 
plaint till on our last day s march, when he was put into one of 
the wagons. Upon getting into camp, he was sent to the 
hospital, where he now is, delirious and fast failing. 



186 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Upon our return commissions were found waiting for 
Sergeants Pennell of E, and Far well of A, to Lieutenancies in 
Colored regiments. Recommendations of four applicants for 
examination by the Board in Washington, and of two men to 
Governor Andrew, to be commissioned by him, in regiments 
now being raised at home, were forwarded to-day. 

Each company lias purchased a pa-tent "meat chopper," also 
wire toaster or gridiron, substitute for the everlasting frying 
pan, which Uncle Sam. issues. Henceforth we can enjoy broiled, 
instead of fried beefsteak ; and can luxuriate in hash. As a 
necessary consequence, there will be considerable increase of 
company savings. The Regimental fund lias been drawn upon 
for the means with which to procure like articles for our 
hospital. The line officers are making arrangements for a ball, 
to come off on NCAV Year s Eve ; our absence at Christmas 
having prevented the one intended for that time. 

2$th. Gen. Sullivan made a congratulatory call, at Head 
quarters, this P. M., being very profuse in his compliments to 
the regiment, and leaving a written order directing " Lieut. 
Col. Lincoln to take command of the brigade, in the absence of 
Col. Wells;" a course rendered necessary, by the presence, at 
the post, of Col. Simpson of the 9th Maryland, ranking officer, 
whom Sullivan refuses to recognize. 

In a full and free conversation about various bodies of troops 
and their manner of performing duty, he remarked, that " the 
34th was the only regiment he had ever seen, which was as 
well entitled to commendation for real work, as for style" as he 
was. pleased to call it; adding that "when he assumed command 
here, he made up his mind that we could not be equalled on 
parade, Jnrt that probably we were worthless in every other 
respect. Yet to his surprise, he found on trial, that we were 
most excellent in every place, and for every duty." 

The re-clothing of the men throughout, although just pre 
vious to the late expedition, we had issued an entire outfit, 
was completed to-day. 

Nearly all the articles now furnished by the government, 
the shoes, especially, are of very poor quality, not only as 
regards the manufacture, but also so far as the material is 



HARPER S FERRY. 187 

concerned. Men, with clothing drawn a week ago, are actually 
more ragged than some whose clothes were issued months 
since. 

If only the boys could get at the contractors ! There would 
be no one here at any rate, to pity or take their part. 

We had a curious affair last night. Our outer pickets are 
from a squadron of Pennsylvania cavalry, one post, of six of 
its men, being at " Keyes Ford," on the " Shenandoah," two 
or three miles in front. The Sergeant in charge, last nio-ht, 

O O " t3 

having posted his sentinel, laid down by the fire with the rest 
of his party, and all slept. A little fellow by the name of 
" Mobbly, from White s battalion, Rebel Guerillas, stole upon 
this party, and securing their arms, actually kicked them to 
wakefulness. Securing the sentinel, he marched the whole 
party to the banks of the river; and learning from their state 
ments that they were six months men, and that their time would 
expire on the fifth of next month, he released them with the not 
very complimentary remark, that he " reckoned they were n t 
of much account to either party." An order, Headquarters Gen. 
Sullivan, constituting "Lieut. Col. Lincoln commander of the 
post, with orders to report, in person, for instructions," covered 
by a personal note, giving information of the near approach of 
Early, and advising to increased watchfulness, was received 
to-day. 

Some of the prisoners brought in by us have enlisted into the 
II. S. Service, and are full of fight and revenge. 

One of them a South Carolinian, has joined the ranks of the 
34th, and seems already at home beneath the white flag of old 
Massachusetts. 

30th. We left in camp, at our departure upon the late expe 
dition, three tiers of fire-wood, each 160 feet long and six feet 
high. Old Flagg gobbled it all while we were away, and our 
daily detail of sixty choppers, is making sad havoc with the 
beautiful oak groves of Mr. Lucas s estate. He pleads ear 
nestly that we should spare a part, but in vain. 

Now, at midnight, an orderly brings dispatches directing the 
34th and Miner s Battery to be in readiness to march early to 
morrow morning, to Charlestown, in support of Boyd, who is in 



188 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

camp there, with all our available cavalry ; and which place is 
threatened by Early. The 12th Virginia is to cross from Mary 
land Heights, and hold the breastworks behind which we are 
encamped. 

31st. The historic " all quiet on the Potomac " is not, as 
yet, disturbed. Bartlett, of K, died to-day, from typhoid fever, 
brought on by the exposure and fatigue of the last expedition. 
Howard, of B, who, however, did not accompany us, is very low 
with the same disease. 

We have, to-day, but eleven officers of the line reported 
" present for duty." Assistant Surgeon Thorndike has received 
his commission as Surgeon of the 39th, and is to leave us forth 
with, very much to our regret. We shall be fortunate indeed 
if we secure a successor who comes any way near filling his 
place. 

It has rained violently, and without any intermission, all day. 

The 12th Virginia, which has been standing to its arms since 
early morning, without blankets or rations (the Major in com 
mand giving as a reason that his orders did not require him to 
take either,) has just now, 7 p. M., received orders to " draw two 
days rations and make themselves comfortable where they are." 
In the absence of any direction how this last part of the order is 
to be executed, we have volunteered to vacate a tent in each 
company street for their occupation. 

We are, as we have been all day, ready to fall in at a 
moment s notice, and Miner still has his horses in harness. 

A general order, " Headquarters 1st Brigade," has just been 
sent down by Col. Wells, "thanking the command for their 
" patience and endurance in the late expedition, with the state- 
" ment that the conduct of the troops had merited and received 
" the warmest encomiums from both division and department 
commanders." 

The day s work closes for me, by a letter to Gov. Andrew, 
acknowledging the receipt of his dispatch, communicating the 
fact that D B had been named to him as a suitable person to 
fill the place in the staff made vacant by the resignation of our 
late Chaplain. While admitting the irreproachable conduct and 
character of private B., in fear that his past service in the 



FTARPER S KKRKY. 181) 

ranks would much weaken the respect in which such ollicers 
should be held, and so impair his usefulness, the benefit of the 
proposed favor was respectfully declined. 

" The Ball," arranged by the officers, to come off last evening, 
proved to be a failure ; partly by reason of the severity of the 
weather, and somewhat on account of our unsettled condition. 
The ladies of the neighborhood, with few exceptions, sent in 
during the afternoon, little notes, expressive of their regret at 
feeling compelled to withdraw their previous acceptance. Those 
who did not so decline, started on their way, but, without an 
exception, failed to reach the ball room. 

In the almost total darkness of the night, Capt. B , having 

in charge the Misses S , was driven over a cellar-wall, his 

ambulance over-turned, and his party spilled into the mud and 
water, of the cellar, from which, after much trouble, they were 
extricated, with no other damage than a thorough wetting. 
Yielding to entreaties, he turned, and landed his fair com 
panions safely at their own houses. Notwithstanding this 
desertion by the ladies, the officers resolved into a u (lander 
party," and made a " night of it," by themselves. 

Jan y 1, 1864. After two days continuous heavy rain, the 
storm broke about midnight, and this morning the sun shines 
brightly. Early in the day, orders from Sullivan s Headquar 
ters, directed " Lieut. Col. Lincoln, to move his brigade, at 
once, to Bolivar Heights, and occupy that position; holding it 
unless firing should be heard in front, in which case, he would 
move rapidly in the direction thereof, without waiting for 
specific orders." Rations were at once issued, and the com 
mand marched to the designated point. The Redoubts, on 
each side the Pike, were occupied by the Artillery; and the 
Infantry was drawn up in support, sheltered, so far as was 
possible from the severity of the weather. Headquarters were 
established under the lee; of a pile of brush, where, wrapped in 
our blankets and cloaks, we could watch the country for miles 
around. 

So far as the eye could reach, the Pike was occupied by the 
Quartermaster s department of the Cavalry force at Charles- 
town ; and a perfect mob of camp followers, hurrying confusedly 
to the protection which our position was supposed to offer. 



190 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

All manner of stories were told by these fugitives. What 
was certain was, that Early, in force, was advancing and threat 
ening Charlestown, and a brush seemed imminent. 

In the bitter cold of a biting wind, with no shelter, and 
without a stick of wood within reach, the Infantry was fast 
becoming benumbed, and unserviceable. The men of the 12th 
Virginia, mountaineers principally, started some rabbits from 
among the weeds, and brush, and pursued with wild halloos. 
This had the good effect of restoring circulation, at least ; and 
the 34th, stacking their arms, joined in the exciting sport. 
Deployed as skirmishers, the men swept along in a wild chase 
after the frightened animals, and run down and caught more 
than a hundred of them. The day was thus passed ; and 
towards night, the troops were re-called by an order from Divi 
sion Headquarters, which order also directed the command to 
be continued in readiness to move upon receipt of orders. kt So 
severe was the cold, that one man in the bivouac of the Cavalry 
perished from exposure. 

2d. Our condition remains the same, couriers from Boyd, in 
front, bringing intelligence that Early, witli his force, is be 
tween Berryville and Winchester. In the interregnum, the 
regiment was mustered for pay. A rigid inspection showed 
that we were in readiness for whatever might be in store for us. 

3d. The weather still continues intensely cold ; our condi 
tion the same, with the exception that at noon to-day all the 
Artillery of the Brigade moved out to Hall town, where 
Wheaton s Brigade, the 3d of the 6th Corps, three to four 
hundred Infantry (which reached here by rail yesterday), is 
encamped. 

Early lies in bivouac from Summit Point to Bunker Hill. 
Averill, with his Cavalry, has reached Martinsburgh from his 
late raid. 

Assistant Surgeon Smith, for a long time Acting Post Sur 
geon, has been relieved and returned to us, much to our joy. 
Thorndike still remains with us, Maj. Gen. Kelley refusing his 
muster out to accept his promotion in the 39th, on the ground 
" that the exigencies of the service require his presence in this 
department." 



HARPER S FERRY. 191 

4th. A good many Rebel deserters come into this post daily. 
They represent their sufferings as having been dreadful. 
Averill is hanging on Early s rear, and is reported to have 
driven him yesterday back to Strasburg. 

Our own position is unchanged. The 12th Virginia left at 
noon to-day, by rail, under orders to report at Cumberland. 

Lieut. Hall, having in charge our rolls and a party of 
prisoners, left for Washington to-day ; and Lieut. Lincoln is 
detailed again for to-morrow to escort another lot of Rebel 
prisoners to Wheeling. 

5th. We had a light fall of snow last night, and to-day, 
although the snow has changed to rain, the cold is becoming 
more severe. 

A note from Gen. Sullivan, in response to an application 
addressed to his Headquarters, stating "that the present is an 
opportune moment for Lieut. Col. Lincoln to avail himself of 
the leave of absence granted some days since, as there is no 
enemy near," led to preparations for departure by that Officer 
on the night train; but the arrival of the 10th Maryland, about 
two hundred and fifty strong, suddenly hurried from Baltimore 
by orders from Washington, led to a change of purpose. 

Reports were current in that city that Martinsburg had been 
taken, and- Harper s Ferry seasonably evacuated ; its garrison 
having succeeded in escaping to Maryland Heights. Halleck 
had ordered all troops, which could be spared, to be hurried 
from Baltimore to the defence of this place. 

Lieut. Elwell telegraphs that ninety recruits for us left Boston 
on Saturday last. 

6th. In the absence of Lieut. Col. Lincoln, who left to-day, 
the command of the regiment devolved upon Major Pratt. 

9th. An order, received at Headquarters at 5 A. M., calling- 
out the entire regiment, was promptly responded to. In ten 
minutes from the time of its receipt, the boys filed out from 
camp on a hurried march to support Cole, who, for weeks past, 
has been scouting London County, with success ; and whose 
camp was surprised, about 2 o clock this morning, by about 
three hundred from White s and Mosby s bands of guerillas. 
The first knowledge Cole had of the presence of the enemy was 



192 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

from a volley fired upon his men, sleeping in their tents ; and 
although taken unawares, he succeeded in rallying his command, 
attacked in turn, re-possessed his camp, and repulsed the enemy, 
who left upon the field three officers and four privates killed, 
with a large number of wounded. The distance to Cole s camp 
was some three miles ; and, although the regiment moved at a 
quick step, its arrival was too late to be of any service, 

Leaving Companies A and G in temporary support of Cole, 
the Major conducted the balance of the regiment back to the 
Ferry. Lieut. Horton, by order of the War Department, has 
been detached from the regiment, and appointed Commissary of 
Musters, 1st Division, Department West Virginia. 

14A. Ninety recruits reached us to-day in charge of Capt. 
Bacon, who had been sent to Washington for them. 

Our force, at this post, is lessened by the departure for home 
and muster out of the 21st Pennsylvania Cavalry, six months 
men. 

"LQth. The "1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, Department 
of West Virginia," is, by General Order of this date, dissolved, 
and u the 34th" is temporarily attached to the 3d (Wheaton s) 
Brigade, "6th Army Corps, Army of the Potomac." The 
change is welcomed at Regimental Headquarters, and will be a 
relief to the men. 

Capt. Leach, in command of one hundred men, has been des 
patched, with five days rations, to scout through Loudoii 
County, towards Snicker s Gap. In imitation, perhaps, of the 
example set on the occasion of our Valley Expedition, the hour 
of setting forth, the place for the respective night s bivouac, the 
time of reaching and leaving the Gap, and the route to be fol 
lowed both going and returning, is prescribed in Division Gen 
eral order. Capt. Chandler, F Co., returned to-day from his 
late leave of absence. 

20th. General Order " Division Headquarters," of this date, 
detachs from Wheaton s Brigade, the 34th Massachusetts 
Infantry, and directs that it " form an independent command, 
" to report directly to Gen. Sullivan, commanding the Division." 

Capt. A. D. Pratt has left for home on a twenty days leave 
of absence. 



HARPER S FERRY. 193 

21st. "New brooms sweep clean." Instance: "One Cap- 
" tain, two Lieutenants, with forty men, and a bugler from the 
" 34th Massachusetts Infantry, henceforth daily, will report to 
" Gen. Sullivan, in person, for duty as patrol." 

"Any soldier on the street, in the day time, without a pass 
" from his Regimental or Battalion Commander, is to be arrested. 
" If Cavalrymen, they are to be dismounted, and their horses 
" turned over to the Post Quartermaster. Any citizen or 
" soldier on the street after 6-j p. M., is to be confined in the 
" Guard House. Officers, if without the countersign, are to be 
" placed in arrest." Such is the order promulgated yesterday. 
In consequence, the Guard House is literally crammed with pris 
oners, among them being a Lieutenant of the 102d New York, 
and the entire body of teamsters attached to the Post Quarter 
master s Department. 

Lieut. Col Lincoln returned to-day from his leave of absence, 
and Capt. Bacon and Lieut. Murdock left on leave. 

An order from Division Headquarters directs us to furnish 
a "guard of one hundred men at the Pontoon Bridge." 

With this, came an order directing " the band of the 34th 
Massachusetts regiment, to report this evening at Division 
Headquarters. Now, while the members of the band are 
enlisted men, liable to duty as such in the ranks, they are 
musicians, only by a little private arrangement known to 
themselves, and the officers of the regiment. To us, they are 
musicians, performing upon instruments either purchased by 
themselves, or by appropriation from the Regimental fund ; but 
to the world they are soldiers and soldiers only. Unwilling 
to recognize Gen. Sullivan s authority over them " as a band," 
Regimental Special Order directs each member, by name, to 
report in full uniform, with side arms, but without instruments, 
at Division Headquarters, this evening, at the hour designated 
by Division Order. 

No " sound of revelry was heard " where fair ladies and 
brave men had gathered to make the eve " pass merrily as a 
marriage bell;" but instead thereof, "how dared he" do this? 
" Send for him, to report at once," and upon the appearance of 
the representative of the 34th : " What means this Col ? How 



194 THIRTY-FOUBJTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

dared you disobey my order? " "What order, Gen.?" "What 
order? What order? You know very well sir! Mrs. S 
desires to have a little dance, and I ordered yon to send down 
your band, to furnish the music ; instead of which, a dozen or so 
of private soldiers report with their side arms, but without iristru- 
&lt;meiits." " Where is your band ? " " I recognize General, your 
authority over me, and the men of the 34th regiment ; but the 
musical instruments of our band, are private property, belong 
ing to the musicians themselves, or the officers of the regiment, 
used for our own gratification, by contract with each man, for 
which we pay from our own pockets. These men are enlisted 
soldiers ; as such, and only as such, are they subject to your 
order, and- " "But they have played at my quarters before 
this, Col., at my request? " "Certainly Gen., and will again, 
when you request it! " "It s the order then, you object to !" 
" Only that, Gen. ! " "Well, Mrs. S. wants the music ! will you 
see that she is gratified ? " " With pleasure, sir." And so the 
affair terminated. 

31s. Dr. Thorndike left to-day, for his new position, as 
Surgeon of the 39th. 

A raiding party has been sent out, with orders to search 
every house, and seize all liquor found. We hear by deserters, 
who come in daily, that " Early " is encamped at Woodstock. 

A paper is being circulated, and has been signed by about a 
third of the boys, containing an agreement to serve for three 
years longer, provided the government \vill accept the service, 
and allow us the usual furlough home ; the order of the govern 
ment, in regard to such re-enlistment, not applying to the 34th, 
as there is more than twelve months of our original term 
unexpired.

Feb. \st. US A. M.: The Regiment is in marching order, 
with three days rations, and sixty rounds ball cartridges. We 
are to move without tents ; officers without horses ; and wait, 
only, the making up of a train, in which to be transported to 
Cumberland ; where Kelley, in anticipation of being attacked 
by Early, is concentrating troops. It is raining hard. 

1 P. M. Orders are just handed in, directing " the com 
manding officer of the 34th Mass. Infantry to move, at once, 
with five hundred men, to the railroad station, to take transpor 
tation for Cumberland." Twenty sergeants, forty-Jive corporals, 
and three Jiundred and eight privates, being every man of the 
command, in camp, fit for duty, and subject to Regimental 
order, were moved. Upon reaching the station, the Patrol and 
Provost guard, were urgent in their request to be taken into 
the line. Representing to the Gen. this desire of the men, he 
gave his consent to our drawing one hundred imn from the 
guards at the Ferry. While the men were being embarked, 
Gen. S. communicated his orders verbally thus : u You d better 
put one or more reliable officers, upon the engine, Col ! I shall 
hold you responsible for the train, and the command. These 

conductors, and engineers, are all d d rebels ; you must 

watch them closely, and upon the slightest evidence of their 



196 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

unfaithfulness, you must blow out their brains, and run the 
train yourself." 

" Be very careful, as you near 4 Clear Spring ; you will prob 
ably be fired upon there ; and should you be, you will land your 
force, and burn every building in the neighborhood. At all 
hazards, Col., you will force your Avay through ; " and, with a 
significant look, he added, " mind, and remember, that I don t 
want you should bring me any live prisoners." " Let me have 
your orders in writing, Gen., if you please." " There is no time 
for that, Col.; every minute is precious ; your train is ready. 
Good-bye." 

Capt. Willard and Lieut. Goodrich were placed upon the 
engine, with directions to look closely after the engineer, and 
off we steamed ; our comrades left on duty, waving and shout 
ing farewell greetings. Nothing interrupted our rapid run. All 
went, and promised well, bearing " Clear Spring," our speed 
was slackened ; and, steam being shut off, we approached with 
caution, and with no noise, save the rumbling of the train. 
The station was reached ; and instead of rebel bullets, a des 
patch from Gen. Kelley was received, urging all possible speed 
in reaching Cumberland. With open throttle the engine was 
urged forward ; and at 7 P. M. the Regiment was reported, at 
Department Headquarters, as "present for duty." " Go back to 
your command, Col., at once. Keep your men together. Don t 
leave them a moment ; orders are now being made out. We 
shall send you to New Creek, or Patterson s Creek, both of 
which places are threatened." Hours passed, and no orders came. 
We were crowded, compelled to stand in close box-cars, which 
had been used for the transportation of cattle ; and which were 
offensive, and filthy; not having been cleaned at all since hav 
ing last been so used. Is it any wonder that the men grumbled? 
or that no one, when morning dawned, was in very good 
humor ? The Adjutant, despatched to Gen. Kelley s quarters, 
returned with information, that orders would reach us, so soon 
as it was determined to what point we were to be sent ! While 
waiting, an engine whizzed by us, from the east. The Gruard, 
(a company^) at Patterson s Creek, had been captured, and the 
bridge across the stream had been burned, during the night, by the 



CUMBERLAND AND RETURN. 197 

rebels. The horse had been stolen ; yet the stable could be 
even now locked ; so the 113th New York was hurried off, by 
special train, to guard what had been destroyed, and we were soon 
after disembarked. Halloa ! what does this mean ? Officers, 
mounted and spurring for dear life ! " Col. Lincoln," said Col. 
Wells, "the General directs you to move your Regiment at 
double quick, to Black s Hill!" " Where s that?" "Over 
take that Battery, you are to support it," and turning, he dashed 
away. By a short cut, across the fields, we passed the Battery 
as it ascended, the hill, and, filing to the left, drew up in line, 
on its crest. Here Gen. Kelley and staff, Col. Campbell, Post 
Commander, and staff, the Post Q. M. with his clerks, Col. 
Wells, with other officers, members of the Court Martial in 
session here, all constituting a cavalcade, formidable in members 
at least, rode up, and gave the necessary orders, for the dispo 
sition and unlimbering of the Artillery. 

What did it all mean? Vague rumors of the near and 
threatening position of the enemy were Hying among us, when 
suddenly the circle round the General was broken, and out 
from the group, his horse bounding madly under the spur, 
dashed our Colonel with orders to send, at a double quick, a 
company deployed as skirmishers through the woods in our 
front. " Soley " stripped his men to light order and was off in 
a twinkling. Wells had hardly rejoined the circle of officers 
when, turning, he galloped again towards us, his clear voice 
ringing out the order to send to our right flank another Com 
pany also as skirmishers. " You re in for it," exclaimed he, as 
in obedience to the order A, (Capt. Willard), started, deploying 
as it went. "What is it, Colonel?" "The enemy in force are 
advancing in this direction; one of //our men has been captured 
by them ; has escaped, but with the loss of his musket" " One 
of ours? captured by the enemy! I guess not, Colonel; ivho is 
he? irherei* he? what s his name?" "I can t tell his name, 
but (as the circle of officers around Kelley just then broke, 
showing the soldier standing in bold relief), there he stands!" 
What a laugh broke from us as the fellow was recognized. 
"What is there to laugh at?" asked Wells. "To think how 
you ve been sold!" "Sold! Sold! how, and by whom?" 
16 



198 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" Only, Colonel, that I ll bet there is lit another officer in the 
command who wouldn t have known that miserable devil, at 
sight !" u What do you mean, sir, by such a remark?" " This, 
Colonel, that in your informant, stands Malcolm Smith, the 
greatest liar among us ; a man for whom a party has been 
scouring Cumberland all the morning ; who slipped away 
from his company sometime last night, leaving his musket be 
hind him, which his Captain, and not the Rebels, has got. I ll 
wager, Colonel, the man is drunk; and when you have got 
from him all the information you desire, we Ve a little account 
against him to be settled." Wells rejoined Kelley ; the Officer 
of the Day claimed S - as his prisoner, and Orderlies were 
despatched to recall Capts. Soley and Willard, who, conducting 
their Companies cautiously through the woods, had just caught 
sight of and were preparing to pick off the pickets of our 
friends of the 12th Virginia, on post in our front. The affair 
caused much merriment among us, and we were still enjoying 
ourselves over it, when the Colonel rode up and very gravely 
gave Gen. Kelley s instructions that " S - should be kept in 
arrest until our return to the Ferry, when charges would be 
preferred against him before General Court Martial. " FOT 
what ? Colonel," was the enquiry. " For what ! why, for 
creating a false alarm in camp; a most serious offence!" "I 
guess I wouldn t, Colonel, it won t sound well, will it, for the 
General commanding? Better leave him to us." "Well, you 
have the General s order," were his parting words as he turned 
and joined the Cavalcade, which was on its way to town. We 
were left to ourselves, in the mud and water of the cold and 
spongy soil. 

Late in the evening our good friends, the 12th Virginia, now 
in barracks, generously sent for our comfort their tents and 
stoves, without which we should have had a night of much 
suffering, as we were forbidden to cut down any standing trees 
for our fires. 

2&gt;d. A note, from the Col., requesting that the Band might 
be ordered to report to him, for the purpose of serenading some 
ladies in the village, was returned, with the information that it 
was not with us. His request that it should be sent for, was 



CUMBERLAND AND RETURN. 199 

declined, in view of the uncertainty of our stay here, and final 
destination. But, by order of Col. Wells, direct, it joined 
us this afternoon. 

6th. We have laid in the mud and water for a week ; no 
enemy nearer us at any time than the raiding party at " Patter 
son s Creek," and no alarm more serious than that created by 
Malcolm S s drunken performance. The time has been idled 
away by us. An attempt at drill was made, the intention being 
to surprise the good people of " Cumberland," by the invasion 
of their village, by the regiment on skirmish drill. But the 
state of the fields was too bad to warrant the attempt, and we 
laid quietly in camp. No good, so far as we can perceive, has 
come to any one by our presence here, save, perhaps, what may 
have resulted from the nightly playing of the band beneath the 
whidows of the female members of a traveling theatre company 
performing in the town. 

1th. At 6 P. M., orders came to take cars for transportation 
to the Ferry. The camp was struck at once, and, leaving our 
stores, of all kinds, in charge of Quartermaster Sergeant Trum- 
bull, the regiment was marched to the line of the railroad. 
Here a line of close box cattle cars, the floors of which were 
ankle deep with the droppings of their last living freight, was 
pointed out for our occupancy. This was too much ! On our 
way up we had submitted to such transportation without a 
murmur. Under orders to move towards the enemy, nicety as 
to the mode of going seemed in bad taste. But now it was dif 
ferent. A day s difference in the time of reaching the Ferry 
could not be of much account, and orders to march were with 
held. An interview was sought with the commanding General. 
Representations of the fil thin ess of the cars provided for us, fell 
upon listless ears. Permission to march to our destination was 
asked and denied ; and it was only after an explicit refusal to 
order the regiment into the cars which were provided for us that 
any attention was given to the remonstrance. A train of box 
cars, clean, however, was at length furnished, and at a little after 
8 we were started on our way. 

8th. We reached our camp after a run of about three hours, 
last night. We found forty additional recruits, who arrived 



200 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

during our absence, waiting assignment to their companies. 
We found, also, that we were in bad odor at Division Headquar 
ters. All because of the number of men taken to Cumberland. 

Our original order specified five hundred as the number to be 
taken. Three hundred and seventy-three only were in camp 
subject to the order. Seeing the anxiety of the men of the vari 
ous guards at the Ferry to accompany us, the General himself, 
had given verbal permission to take with us all wlw desired to 
go. The members of the band had joined us after we reached 
Cumberland. An attempted explanation of the unintentional 
disobedience of orders was cut short by the General s u No 
"matter! No matter about it now ! Let it all go ! I damned 
" you enough for it while you were gone ! " 

We left in hospital, at " Cumberland," one of our men, sick 
from wet, cold and exposure. While there, a man who h#d 
suffered for months from " aphonia," upon being spoken to by 
the doctor, at surgeon s call, answered in his former loud voice, 
and quickly disappeared from his wondering companions, in 
seeming fright at the unwonted noise. How queer, such cases ! 

9th. The assignment of all our recruits to the companies of 
their choice is at length completed, and the rolls of such 
disabled men as we desire to discharge from the regiment, 
has been made out. Mainly, these are lit subjects for the in 
valid corps. 

The 14th New Hampshire, attached to Wheaton s brigade, 
sent to fill our place, while we were in Cumberland, and whose 
quarters are in the grave yard, near our camp, is now ordered 
out to Halltown. Just previous to leaving Washington, this 
regiment received ninety drafted men, or substitutes therefor, 
and lost fifty of them by desertion, before roll call, the next 
morning. 

Their drills, guard mounting, and parades furnish much 
amusement to our boys. At parade, if a head itches, off 
comes the cap, that a good scratching may be had; noses get 
many a brush and buffet, as intrusive flies light upon and 
tickle such members ; and many a time, a good riatured fellow 
turns upon his heel to exchange a friendly word with his rear 
rank neighbor. It is hard to realize that our boys, who now 



CUMBERLAND AND RETURN. 201 

stand like carved statues, under all such provocation, could 
ever have been such uiidrilled and gawky fellows as these 
men are. 

10th. The small pox, which has of late been somewhat 
prevalent among us, is abating ; but the measles threaten us 
instead, having been now, as when we were at Fort Lyon, 
introduced into camp, by men 011 their return from furlough. 

Lieut. Walker, of A, has sent in his resignation, which lias 
been forwarded, approved. 

An order from A. A. A. G. Nims, Gen. Sullivan s staff, 
directs " Lieut. Col. Lincoln immediately to detail from the 
84th Massachusetts infantry, a competent non-commissioned 
officer, to take command of a colored pioneer corps" This was 
done, and the officer reported himself at Division Headquarters. 
There being no " pussons " there, from whom the corps could 
be formed, new orders were issued, directing the -Sergeant "to 
take a file of men, and scour Bolivar, and the Ferry, and 
impress all niggers found running at large." 

For "fatigue," we send daily to the village, all soldiers who 
know how "not to do it" instead of those who fancy they must 
do an honest day s work, 110 matter of what nature it is. We 
were green once, but have got all over it, and none of us fancy 
an order to scrape the streets. 

We are sending home our men as fast as possible, on fur 
loughs of ten days time, in view of a more active service in 
store for us, having now fifty absent. As an inducement to 
good conduct, preference is given to applications coming from 
men unexceptionable in deportment. 

A gray headed, simple, but well meaning old man, bearing 
the broad seal of the Christian Commission, detailed, as he says, 
for six weeks, "to do good in the army" came to us to-day. His 
great anxiety seems to be to find some building, in which to 
gather together the Masons of the regiment, " to teach them 
morals," as he says. "Ah, Col., you re not a brother," he 
remarked, as inability to furnish any assistance in his search, 
was expressed. 

11th. The Paymaster has settled with us, and now, midnight, 
all is quiet ; not a soul in the Guard House. 



202 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

A new detail of fifty men is called for from the regiment, for 
fatigue in the Ferry, to be under the command of Lieutenant 
" McOrmber," as he is designated in the order. 

The startling announcement was made, at reveille roll call 
this morning, that Hurley, of G, had been found in his bunk, 
dead. He answered to his name at tattoo call, last night. 
Upon inquiry, it came out that he, with Wagner of the same 
Company, left camp in the evening and purchased at a house 
of an Irishman near by, a bottle of whiskey, Hurley, as his com 
panion says, drinking the largest half of the liquor. 

In consequence of this, a party was despatched from camp, 
with orders to " search every house in the neighborhood, seize 
" all liquor, and arrest every party in whose possession any spir- 
" its should be found." 

Apropos to this : Who of us will ever forget Grady, of H. 
Ignorant, stubborn, but well meaning on the whole ; when 
sober, a good soldier ; when drunk, which is too often the case, 
a terrible nuisance. As the boys say, u he is one of em." As 
a rule, we are chary of giving him favors, but he has been 
behaving so well lately, that he was allowed a pass to the vil 
lage to-day. Returning in good season, but a little mellow, he 
thus accosted the Captain : " Well, Captain, when are you 
" going to let us roughs go home ? " " Never, Grady ! never 
" until you learn to keep sober." " Sober, is it ; sober, is it, you 
u mane? Well, then, let me ask you a bit of a question. Don t 
" you give furloughs now to your best soldiers, Captain ? Don t 
"you do it, I ask?" "Certainly, Grady, certainly! and if you 
"had let whiskey alone, you d have had your furlough long 
" ago." " Well now, Captain, see here ! I ain t the worst sol- 
"dier you ve got, am I? say now, Captain, am I?" "Well, no, 
" Grady ; you re one of the best when you let whiskey alone !" 
" Well, then, Captain, see here now ; I ll tell you how tis ! and 
" we ll fix it. You just let Grady go home, like a good fellow 
"as ye are, and as for the whiskey the whiskey tis, Cap- 
" tain, ye mind! why, don t ye give that a furlough at all, at 
"all!!" 

And here s another. 

" Lieutenant," said Capt. W., " where can a man get a drop, 



CUMBERLAND AND RETURN. 203 

just a drop to rinse out his mouth?" "I can t tell, Captain." 
" Oh, come now, be a good fellow, Pm so dry. I d give a dol 
lar that is, I would if I had one, for just one swallow ! The 
least mite of a taste would do me." And E., who knew, weak 
ened and told, adding " that there was but a drop in the can 
teen, and he didn t believe he could get that." " You come along 
and see," said W., and off they went. " Good morning, good 
morning, Colonel." " Good morning, Captain, take a seat ; 
what can I do for you this morning ? " " Nothing special, Col 
onel ; its a friendly call ; its pretty cold weather, Colonel ; yes ! 
It s dry, too very dry! yes! The boys are behaving pretty 
well now, Colonel ! yes, very well." "A little noisy, perhaps? " 
" Not bad. They sing a good deal, Colonel ; yes, sometimes. I 
sing a song or two, myself, Colonel ; perhaps you would like to 
hear me now ; " and a willingness being expressed, the Captain, 
in a voice anything but musical, in a* slow strain at the start, 
but increasing his time gradually, till the last line, which was 
rattled off at a double quick, thus broke out : 

Between you and me, I really think, 
Between you and me, I really think, 
Between you and me, I really think, 

It s just about time to take a little drink. 

The Colonel surrendered ; the canteen was produced, and W. 
took his swallow. Civility required that he should not now 
hurry away. So general conversation was kept up for some 
time, till W., dry again, essayed another performance, this time 
concluding his stanza with, " Its time now to take another 
drink." But it didn t work so well as at first, and the party 
separated. 

Our old friend from Maine called again to-day. 

" I have called upon you, Colonel, to inform you that some 
body, a good Congregationalist Clergyman, from the hills of 
Berkshire, has arrived, charged particularly to look after the 
well-being of the 34th." " Well, my dear sir," was the answer, 
" I am very glad to hear it ; that is, if the man has got any 
common sense, which you will remember I have said was not, in 
my opinion, the richest possession of the men of your cloth." 



204 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" You are more than half right, Colonel, in that ; and, if you 
say so, I ll sound this fellow, and if he is nt the right thing, I ll 
come up myself on Sunday, and preach to you." " Good ! we 
shall be glad to have you. You re one of the right sort, and if 
you 11 promise to be here certainly, the parade shall wait for 
you." 

The only drawback to this old gentleman is his extreme 
anxiety as to the number of Masons, or as he terms them, 
" Brothers" among us. 

Told, by way of joke, that Miner s men, hard cases, roughs 
all of them, were of the fraternity, "Ah! well," was his pleas 
ant rejoinder, " there are always found Tares among Wheat." 

~L2th. Another alarm last night, causing the whole command 
to be turned out and kept under arms. It was occasioned by 
a party of Rebels, under Gilmer, who, striking the railroad at 
Duffield, tore up the track, causing the up night train to be 
thrown off. This done, Gilmer distinguished himself by in 
discriminate robbery of all the passengers, male and female, 
taking all they had of money, watches and jewelry. 

With a consideration altogether unusual, Gen. Sullivan, 
instead of sending us, on foot, after these mounted robbers, got 
together the patrol and despatched them, by special train, to 
the scene of disaster. 

And in this connection occurred one of those little incidents 
where a well meaning man, by an excess of zeal, gets himself 
into trouble. 

Sergeant Mclver, of G, at the time of this alarm was waiting 
at the station for the down train, on which he was to take to 
Baltimore the remains of Hurley, of his company. 

Leaving "the dead to bury their dead," he borrowed a 
musket, and joined the party sent up to Duffield. Upon his 
return this afternoon, he found the corpse which he had left 
uncared for on the platform, in charge of another of his com 
pany, and an officer in waiting to conduct him to the Guard 
House. We hope to save him from the wrath of the Gen. 
commanding. 

A party of one Lieutenant and five privates, G-reybacks, 
riding upon " McLellan " saddles, on horses branded " U. S.," 



CUMBERLAND AND RETURN. 205 

having with them an ambulance lettered " 5th army corps" 
displaying a white cotton rag fastened to a stick, under escort 
of a squad of New York cavalry, was stopped at our breastworks,, 
to-day, till the pleasure of (Jen. Sullivan could be ascertained. 
Their professed object was to obtain permission to remove the 
body of a Rebel Colonel, killed a year ago, and buried at Shep- 
hardstown, twenty miles north of us. Having nothing to verify 
the character and object of the party, save Rosser s pass, read 
ing : " Guards and pickets will pass Lieut. Allen and party 
through the lines, to remove a body, 1 the officer and his party 
were turned over to the care of the Provost Marshal, the ambu 
lance to the medical purveyor, and all the horses to the Post 
Quartermaster. 

14th. Capt. Bacon and Lieut Walker have returned from 
their leave of absence, and Capt. Pratt and Lieut. Lincoln, away 
on sick leave, have had theiv time extended. 

15/i. The Rebel party which came in, two or three days ago, 
" to procure a body" is ordered to bo sent through the lines, 
" via Hillsboro" thus making a complete circuit of our posts. 
We have received recruits in such numbers as to exceed the 
maximum number allowed a regiment, and have been carrying 
them along until we could make a place for them, by discharg 
ing some of our disabled, about which there has been no little 
difficulty. 

But to-day a departmental general order has been received, 
directing us to " drop from our rolls " the names of forty-seven 
of our old men, and send the men so dropped to Washington, by 
rail, to-night, thus affording us the desired relief. 

Among those absolutely discharged, is Schrock, of A, a vet 
eran recruit, costing, in the language of the boys, "$700 and a 
cow!" who joine d us in October last, and in eighteen days had 
fourteen fits ; once falling upon a red-hot stove, without the 
power of getting away. 

His rations being deemed more than equivalent for any service 
he has rendered, he is discharged " without final statement." 

It has cost us a good deal of trouble to get rid of this fellow. 

His " discharge papers " were made out, some weeks ago ; 
signed by the proper Regimental officers ; approved at both 



206 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Brigade and Division Headquarters, and sent up to Gen. 
Kelley for his final order. That officer, by the chief of his 
medical staff, returned the discharge papers " disapproved" and 
directed that Schrock should be sent to General Hospital, in 
Frederic, with a suggestion, that it was probably a case of 
malingering. 

Upon the return of the papers thus endorsed, a memorial was 
addressed to the Secretary of War, setting forth the facts, com 
plaining of the unwarrantable action of Department Headquar 
ters, and asking for redress. This memorial, signed by the 
commanding officers of the Company, was forwarded, approved 
by the Regimental, and Brigade Commanders, and by Sullivan, 
without comment. Kelley returned it to Sullivan, for his ap 
proval, or disapproval. Sullivan to his medical director, for his 
opinion. Medical Director Hays to Surgeon Clarke, for his 
opinion, (each of these last officers had signed the man s dis 
charge papers.) The Regimental Surgeon re-forwarded the 
paper, endorsing the representation made by Capt. Willard ; 
Medical Director Hays, " coincided in the conclusions of Sur 
geon Clarke ;" Sullivan expressed " confidence in the opinions 
of Drs. Hays and Clarke, and the representations made by the 
company and Regimental Commanders, and his conviction 
that an investigation of the conduct complained of should be 
had." The paper, thus fortified, was received by Gen. Kelley, 
and he, instead of forwarding it to the War Department, to 
which it was addressed, referred it to his Medical Director, the 
very officer, whose action was complained of, who wrote thereon, 
" Let this man be discharged," to which Kelley added, " without 
pay," and then appended the sweeping endorsement that "what 
ever man of the 34th is pronounced by " Surgeon Clarke, Lieut. 
Col. Lincoln, and Division Medical Director Hays, unfit for 
service, will hereafter be at once discharged." And so we are 
content; and join in the laugh which is raised at Division 
Headquarters over our triumph. 

~LQth. Our invalids (forty-nine in number) left us last night; 
and a sad parting it was. Great men wept, like children, over 
the enforced separation. 

Howard, of I, who had a short time before married a Harper s 



CUMBERLAND AND RETURN. 207 

Ferry girl, had, of course, to leave his wife behind ; and Angell, 
of E, one of the 1700 Veteran Recruits, who joined us in Oct., 
but who has ever since been an inmate of our Hospital, found 
himself, by this move, compelled to defer the consummation of 
his marriage, with one of the Bolivar damsels. 

Davis, of G, discharged, by order of the War Department, to 
enlist as Hospital Steward in the regular service, also left with 
the party. 

"A Board, consisting of Gen. Wheaton, Medical Director 
Hays, Lieut. Col. Lincoln, and Surgeon Clarke, is directed to 
convene, without delay, for the examination of all Recruits 
alleged to be unfit for service. Eight of ours, among them, one 
weak in body and mind, but fourteen years of age, as he 
claims; another, a lad of fifteen, whose pulse is carried to one 
hundred and thirty, by a brisk walk across a room ; and the 
throbbing of whose heart beneath his buttoned overcoat is 
plainly visible at the same distance ; and another so devoid of 
understanding as to be pronounced idiotic all sold by step 
father, or selectmen of towns, for the thirty pieces of silver, are 
to be sent before the board for examination. Three, who joined 
us in October, have already been discharged ; and we have sent 
to the " Invalid Corps," sick men more fit for active duty, than 
some of the recruits now with us. A beautiful new " State 
Flag," reached us to-day, in exchange for our old one, which 
we are directed to return to the State House in Boston. 

VI tli. The wind of yesterday increased in violence during 
the night, and to-day is so intensely cold and windy, that it is 
necessary to relieve the sentinels at the breastworks, every 
forty minutes, instead of once in two hours ; and only four are 
011 post at a time, instead of thirteen. 

"20th. What fluctuations appear in our strength ! A few 
clays since we were up to the maximum number allowed ; the 
next day we were short by two; the day but one after, we were 
short forty-nine ; and now we lack fifty three of our full quota. 
Our recruits, especially the " veterans," think our labors severe 
and altogether hard to bear. In particular, do the} complain 
of the little requirements preliminary to leaving camp. Two,

heard, as they slowly pace the guard parade, with their

22d. The usual, and every day duties required in eain}&gt;, 
have been suspended by order from Division Headquarters. 
The batteries 011 the heights have thundered forth their 
morning and evening salutes, in honor of the day ; and we 
have celebrated it by a street parade, paying to Gen. Wheaton 
the compliment of a marching salute. Lieut. Ammidon, with 
a guard of twelve men, escorted a squad of Rebel soldiers to 
Wheeling; and another squad was brought into the Ferry 
to-day, by a party of " Boyd s " cavalry. 

I have been much amused by a call made to-day by the 
Reverend Mr. P., our good old missionary from Maine. 

" Good morning, Col. ; a glorious day ! a day to.be commemo 
rated in all time ! I called Col., to beg a favor." " What is it, 
sir ? " " Well Col., the brethren have made arrangements to 
celebrate the day, by procession to " Bolivar," and an address 
there, and I have ventured to promise them the benefit of the 
Massachusetts Band! Did I promise too much, Col.? Can^they 
have it, sir?" "Well, my dear sir, if you mean the band of 
the 34th, you promised altogether too much ; you can t have 
that ! " " Indeed, Col., I am very sorry to hear you say so; the 



210 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

brethren will be much disappointed ! Can t we arrange it some 
how? Do you want it yourself, may I ask?" "I do sir!" 
" At what hour, do you think ? " " I can t tell, precisely. I 
propose to make a street parade, at a time yet to be fixed, and 
shall want the band for that purpose." " Oh, indeed, Col. ! 
Well, that 11 be just the thing then, for us ! Instead of the band 
I can hope the regiment will favor the brethren by escorting 
them to Bolivar ! " u No sir, I think not ! I should object 
decidedly to order the regiment to such duty." " That is a 
disappointment indeed, Col ! I don t see what we shall do ! 
But what hour, may I enquire, shall you return to your 
camp ? " " It is impossible to say, sir ; there may be delay in 
paying our proposed compliments to the General ! " " Well 
then, Col., in the situation, I think I had better hurry back to 
the brethren, and have them wait, where they are, until you 
are on your return march ; then we can fall in procession in 
your rear, and take your escort." " In the situation, my dear 
sir, I can t object to your hurrying back to the brethren, but I 
have a decided objection to your stealing the escort, which I 
have already told you I can t give to you." " Indeed Col., 
that s bad ! I thought we might get under your wing, somehow ! 
How unfortunate you re not a brother ! Would it be too much, 
under the circumstances, Col., if I was to ask you to excuse from 
your parade, all the " brethren " in the regiment, that they 
might join our procession ? " " Well, my dear sir, I regret that 
I must refuse you that, also." " I am very sorry, Col. ! very sorry 
indeed ; I was in hope of establishing, to-day, in your regiment, 
a branch lodge, and had prepared an address, calculated, I felt 
sure, to make converts, to what, I am prepared to prove, is the 
oldest and best of all the institutions of the day." 

But without stopping to hear the reply, the old gentleman 
hurried himself out. 

The parade was had afterwards, and the boys, in their best 
clothes, looked and marched their best. Nothing could have 
been -done better. After our return to camp, our old friend 
marched by, heading his procession to Bolivar, and looking as 
proud as if he headed a Division. 

Midnight. The quiet of the camp was broken by clatter of 



VALLEY EXPEDITION. 211 

hoofs and clank of sabre, as drawing up at Headquarters, an 
Orderly presented himself, announcing, "despatches, Colonel, 
immediate!" "Two full companies to report, instantly, at 
" Division Headquarters, with two days rations, and 60 rounds 
" of ball cartridges to a man ; " and every line officer, save those 
on guard, away at a ball given by the Staff of Gen. Wheaton ; 
" Orderly, send the Sergeant-Major here ; then wake up Chase 
" and tell him to saddle, and ride, like the devil, to the Island," 
" with my compliments to Capts. Chandler and Fox, and their 
" Lieutenants, and request them to report at Headquarters, for 
" duty, immediately." " Sergeant-Major, direct l F and H to 
arm as quickly as possible, and be ready to fall in, with rations, 
at tap of the drum." 

How rapidly, and by what slight stir, a regiment is roused 
from slumber ! Heads are thrust from different tents, and 
anxious inquiries, "what is it?" "who goes?" "whereto?" 
are heard, and then sleep comes again quickly to all but those 
who are to march to what, no one can tell. 

By the time " F and H " were ready to fall in, their officers 
reported; but, by that time, also, a second order was received, 
calling for " four companies, the whole under Major Pratt." 
E and G were now roused, and their officers summoned from 
the ball-room. 

No need of longer caution. The long roll could be heard 
from Wheaton s camp, and his Brigade was roused. Our own 
four companies were the only ones which, in fact, moved ; and 
they were sent by rail to Monocacy Junction, under orders " to 
" entrench and hold their position, at all hazards. 1 1 

23d. Orders were received this morning, to forward to Maj. 
Pratt two additional day s rations. Our application for trans 
portation thereof, made to the Post Q. M., was peremptorily 
refused. Red tape is in the way, some where ; and how to cut 
it is the question. But the consideration of that question was 
interrupted, for the time, by the arrival of our cheery old brother 
from Maine. 

" Well, Col.," he broke out, " your Regiment appeared finely 
yesterday, finely ! I was very much pleased with it ; and I 
consider myself a good judge of such matters ; for, as long ago 



212 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

as 1832, I was a Corporal in our State Militia, and was quite 
posted up in the drill! But I have not done much at it since. 
However, that has nothing to do with what I come up to talk 
with you about. 

"I m going, on Sunday, to dedicate the old Brick church in 
the village ; and I want your men to get some evergreen boughs 
for me, so that the charcoal sketches, on the walls may be 
covered up. They are not very appropriate drawings, you 
know. Can you let me have the men, Col.? " " Where do 
you propose to get your evergreens, Sir?" "Oh, anywhere, 
Col. ! Across the Shenandoah, I guess. The boys tell me there 
is enough over there." "I guess there s enough there, sir; but, 
unfortunately for your purpose, there s a Post General order 
which prohibits the Boys from crossing the river." u Oh ! indeed, 
Col., is that so? I m not a military man myself, but that 
seems to me a very strange order! Isn t it? However, I see 
I shall have to give it up." 

"But, Col., there s one thing there can t be any difficulty 
about! I ve got some boards for seats ; and have built a nice 
broad platform for the officers, and the ladies of the village ; 
and I want very much to feel sure of having a good audience 
at my first service. So, may I ask that you will dispense with 
any little duties of the camp, and let your men come down and 
(ill the seats ? " " I regret to say that I can t even do that for 
you, sir; as a General Order from Superior Headquarters pro 
hibits me from granting permission to more than three men to 
a Company, to go down town, at the same time." "Well! J 
seem to run against some order every step I take ! but this one 
seems strange, very strange indeed." "It s very true neverthe 
less, my dear sir." "Does the order apply to officers, Col.? 
and can t you, and your officers attend my service?" "As for 
myself, sir, I never leave camp except on duty-; but, besides, 
to-morrow is our regular Inspection ; and the Boys will all be 
required in camp, for that!" "But the inspection might be 
put off, might it not, Col.? And, by the way, why is it that 
your inspections are had on the Lord s day?" " Well, my dear 
sir, you must go for an answer to that question to those who 
make our orders ! All we have to do is to obey ! " "But, Col., 



HARPER S FERRY. 218 

think of it! such wickedness ought to be done away with ! Its 
monstrous ! its awf ul ! " "Well, sir, perhaps not much can 
be said of the practice. It is something, after all, like the family 
Sunday cleaning, and washing, and dressing of the little ones ; 
a little more thorough than what takes place on other days ! " 
u Yes ; yes, Col. I perhaps so ! " " But now, my dear sir, as we 
can t go down and hear you, in your little church, suppose you 
corne up and see us; and preach to us, too, if you ve a mind. 
We ve no Chaplain, and no one can tell how much good you 
may do ! " 

" I 11 come, Col. ! I 11 come I That is, if I feel well enough ; 
for you see, I ve got a bad cold, and I should not like to add 
to it by being out in bad weather." " I hope you 11 come, sir ! 
We shall all be glad to see and hear you ; and let me give you a 
little warning, now. Don t be disturbed, in case the weather 
should remain as it now is, at an order to the boys to remain 
covered when you offer prayer ! " " You don t mean it, Col. ! 
You can t mean to invoke God s blessing while you stand with 
heads covered ! do you ? " " Most certainly, I do ; that is, if 
the weather should continue wet and chilly, as it now is ! " 
" Well, well, Col., I said I d come, and I will ; but your ways 
are all strange ! and we can all hope it will be fair, can t we?" 
And so we parted. 

24:th. A telegram from Maj. Pratt, at the Monocacy, states 
that " there had not been, was not now, and probably would not 
be, any Rebel force near him," and asking further orders, and 
for tents, if he was to remain, was received at Headquarters, this 
morning. Upon making known its contents, Gen. Sullivan s 
direction was. received to forward to the Major orders to ac 
quaint himself with the nature of the country near him ; partic 
ularly to reconoitre the roads leading to his position, on each side 
of the river, but, on no account, to cross it. Also, to inform 
him that he would remain some days where he was, but would 
not be provided with tents. 

Sergeant Pitts and Corporal Jameson, the former as Captain, 
the latter as Lieutenant, received commissions in some regiment 
of colored troops, to-day. Adams, Aldrich and Chickering, of 
17 



214 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

C, are now before the Examining Board for positions in like 
organizations. 

Thorndike, now with the 39th, in the Army of the Potomac, 
writes, that that regiment is required to furnish a picket of o.ne 
hundred men, for two days duty, once a week, which is all the 
work required of it. How different from what is exacted of 
us ! To-day, for instance, after sending out the old details, the 
regiment has not men enough to fill the new ones just called for. 

An order, received to-day, re-assigning us to -"Wheaton s 
(3d) Brigade, 6th Army Corps," has made us all happy. 

*lbtli. Major General Kelly reached this post last night, on a 
tour of inspection; and to-day at 11 A. M., is named in Division 
Orders, as the time at which all officers of all organizations 
stationed here are ordered to pay their personal respects to him. 

While engaged in this duty, the Lieutenant Colonel command 
ing was handed a Special Order " to hold seventy-five men, with 
five days rations, blankets, arms, and fifty rounds of ammunition, 
ready to march at a moment s notice." Captain Soley, with his 
Company, kC I," strengthened by picked men from "B" and 
4 * I)," was detailed. Route and number of miles for each day s 
march, and hour of starting^ and route of return, prescribed by 
General Order. Destination, Snicker s Gap ! 

It s raining hard, with a high wind, and the night is dark as 
Egypt. 

There are but one hundred and twenty-eight men left in camp 
fit for duty, and these all came off a twenty-four hours tour this 
morning. Capt. Willard is officer of the day at the Ferry; 
Capt. Lovell ditto at camp, and Capt. Thompson is the only 
officer by whom these can be relieved. 

Of course, under such circumstances, some of the men and 
one of the officers will fail to be relieved. 

And now rides into camp an Orderly, with directions to tin; 
commanding officer of " the 34th regiment to report in person, 
forthwith, at Gen. Wheatoii s headquarters, to explain his neglect 
to send out a detail directed by Brigade General Order of this 
morning." 

" You command the 34th Massachusetts, Colonel, do you?" 
asked the General, after my introduction. ^1 have that honor, 



HAKPEK S FEKKY. 215 

General." " You received an order from my headquarters for 
a detail from your regiment this morning ? " " Yes,*ir." "And 
you have not obeyed it !" "No, General; I- "That 

will do, Colonel." "But, General, allow me to explain. I 
could not obey it." "Could not, Colonel ? And your regiment 
almost one thousand strong! I don t understand." "I mean 
to say, General, I had not the men. I could not even relieve a 
portion of my men who were on duty the day before." " Then 
there must be mismanagement in your camp, Colonel." "All 
details from the regiment, General, except my own orderly and 
Headquarters guard, are by order from superior Headquarters ; 
and all my remonstrances against such excessive details arc 
now, as they have always been, entirely unheeded." " Have the 
goodness, Colonel, to bring to me your morning report, and all 
orders calling upon you for details for duty." This was done. 
" Wh/ haven t you complained to the War Department, Colo 
nel? I never saw or knew such abuse of men! You have an 
order, I see, to send one hundred men to your right flank, oppo 
site the pontoon bridge ; is that number necessary there ? " 
" We had but ten men there for months, General." " Reduce 
that detail, then, to the former number. Here are sixty called 
for oji your left ; IIOAV is it at that point ? " "( hir guard at that 
point has been increased from twenty" "Take off forty, then. 
Is it necessary, Colonel, that the patrol should be so large?" 
wb l furnish, General, no more than I am ordered to." "Well, 
vou have been here since July last, I understand, and can judge 
of the necessity of all these details, and of the number required 
at each point. Forward to me a written report of your opinion, 
that your men may be relieved of this load. It s shameful! 

26th. Camp was roused about five this morning by the 
arrival of Major Pratt, who had marched his command from 
the " Monocacy," during the night. 

We have been in a great state of excitement to-day in con 
sequence of an act of highway robbery committed in broad 
day, on the public street near our camp, upon a man of the 
Pennsylvania Cavalry, by Lieut. Berry, Sergeant Green and 
private Berry of Miner s Battery; and the committal of the 
prisoners to the custody of the 34th, whose commander is 



216 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

ordered "to place a guard with loaded musket over them," 
with orders*" to shoot either who may attempt to escape." 

Our old friend, Mr. P., has been round again. 

" Good morning, good morning, Colonel ! I called in to say 
how sorry I was to disappoint you at your service last Sunday. 
Your boys, I find, don t have much religious instruction ! " 
" No, sir, not much ; and though sorry not to see you at parade, 
we got along quite nicety." " But without any service, Col.? " 
" Oh, no sir ; we had service." " Why, I watched your move 
ments, Colonel, from my window, and though I didn t under 
stand them all, I didn t see any which looked like religious 
service. Who- officiated, Colonel, if I may ask?" "I don t 
know, sir ; a young man who introduced himself as a minister. 
I didn t ask his name." "Well, it s strange ! Was he gifted?" 
"He made a very beautiful address, sir, and closed with an 
impressive, though short prayer." "Well, Colonel, I ll hunt 
him up for you ; if he is all right, I ll report to you." 

*2Sth. Capt. Soley, with his party, returned to-day ; the 
object for which he was sent out un(?)accomplished. He did 
one thing, however, which probably was not contemplated ; 
that is, he captured and brought in two blockade runners, with 
one saddle and three team horses, and a wagon loaded with 
dry goods, groceries, etc., packed in boxes, marked to a Mr. 
Riddle, formerly in trade here, now a Custom House officer in 
Baltimore. 

This was the fourth expedition of the kind, which we have 
sent out, in as many weeks. In each case, the order directing 
the movement, prescribed alike the hour of starting from camp, 
the routes to be taken, going and returning, the length of each 
day s march, and the place of each night s bivouac. Permission 
for the officer in command to deviate from his instructions, 
according to his discretion, had been asked and refused. 
Before his departure on this last expedition, the danger of a 
rigid adherence, to this unvarying programme had been dis 
cussed with Capt. S. A hint to such an officer was enough; 
and it is remarkable that now, when, for the first time, our 
party was precisely where, according to its order of march, it 
ought not to have been, a capture should have been made. 



HARPER S FERRY. 217 

Recognizing that " to the victors belong the spoils," the 
Captain was allowed to retain the captured saddle- horse for a 
pack animal, while the wagon and its load of goods was turned 
over to the Provost Marshal. 

Capt. Soley and Lieut. Hall leave to-morrow, for fifteen days 
absence. Capt. Bacon has presented his resignation, the accept 
ance of which has been declined. Our Band is to go, to-morrow, 
to " Frederick," to help along the festivities in that city, conse 
quent upon the public reception of Cole s Battalion, the men of 
which, having re-enlisted for " during the war," go home on a 
thirty days furlough. 

Brigade orders assign to the 34th, as inspecting officer for to 
morrow, Lieut. Col. Moody, of the 39th Pennsylvania, of Whea- 
ton s Brigade, which regiment is to be inspected by Lieut. Col. 
Lincoln, of the 34th. 

29th. We lose, to-day, three more of our men, in consequence 
of being appointed to " commissions in colored regiments." 

Capt. Potter, of B, is brought down, to-day, the surgeons say, 
with an attack of small-pox ; happily of mild form. 

March 1st. Snow has fallen all day, and it is now seven or 
eight inches deep. Our men are suffering, actually suffering, in 
consequence of the unremitting duty required of them. Colds 
and fevers are very prevalent. 

Col. Wells, relieved from duty on court martial, at Cumber 
land, returned to the Ferry to-day. He has been relieved as A. 
B. G., but declined to resume command of the regiment, and 
has left for Baltimore, but in citizen s dress. Before leaving, 
he sent down various letters addressed to him as commanding 
the regiment, requesting that they should be answered. Among 
them were three, from different clergymen at home, asking for 
themselves the appointment of Chaplain; and one from Gov. 
Andrew, in relation to the same office, all which are easily 
enough disposed of. 

" Come out, gentlemen, each of you, and live with us a while, 
" on trial ! If you are worth anything, we shall find it out, and 
" will give you a call, but we take no second one on trust." 

Lieut. Col. Moody returns to the officers commanding com 
panies, their muster rolls, with comments like these : To Capt. 



218 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

B.: "What is Bemis doing among the G s?" To Capt. F. : 
" Your rolls bear marks of carelessness and hurry unbecoming 
an officer." To Capt. L. : " Your rolls are so defective that new 
ones must be made out." On reference to Regimental headquar 
ters, after a careful inspection, barring ink blots and an occa 
sional grease spot, it is concluded that the Col. is a little over 
critical, and, in some points, in actual error, and they are re 
turned to him unaltered. 

3d. Lieut. Lincoln returned from his extended leave of ab 
sence to-day, but without having recovered his voice. 

Seventeen men were taken down sick yesterday, and all sent 
to hospital. Our list of " sick in quarters " is increasing rapidly, 
and the disease, whatever it may be, is alarming. At retreat, 
for instance, a man appears on parade, and by morning, ome 
times by tattoo, he is raving in delirium. All drill has been 
dispensed with to-day, on account of bad weather and deep mud. 

Our Surgeons have united in a written recommendation that 
the Sutler be allowed to keep and sell Beer to the men, under 
proper restrictions. A somewhat hazardous proceeding; yet, 
perhaps, justifiable in our overworked condition. 

4th. Sergeant Blackmer, of H, died last night, delirious to 
the last moment of his life. 

5th. The Regiment is ordered to proceed, by rail, to Point of 
Rocks, and picket the line between that place and the Monocacy. 
This, in consequence of a telegram from Washington, giving in 
formation of the movement, in that direction, of a large Rebel 
force. Pitts, of A, and Jameson, of the same company, received, 
to-day, commissions the former as Captain and the latter as 
Lieutenant in a regiment of colored troops.

The orders to move to the Monocacy were given by General 
Sullivan, in person. " Get together, Colonel, all the men you 
" can, withdrawing from your pickets such numbers as you 
" think best ; see that they are completely armed and equipped; 
" take three days rations, and report with your force to me as 
"soon as possible." Upon reporting: "How many men have 
"you, Colonel?" "I don t know, General." "Find out then, 
" and let me know. You will take with you five hundred effec- 
" tive men : Send back to your camp all over that number, if 
" you have any." A count by the adjutant showed 534 men, 
including buglers, drummers, and officers servants, and upon 
reporting, orders were given to get off, as we were, without 
delay. 

Point of Rocks was reached : Four companies, Capt. Bacon 
commanding, were sent to the " Monocacy," with instructions 
to the Captain to establish pickets, and hold his ground, if 
attacked ; telegraphing for support, if needing any. The fords, 
in the neighborhood, were covered by artillery, supported by 
infantry details ; the banks of the river picketed ; and scouting 
parties of cavalry established to keep open communication from 
post to post. Communication with us was opened by Colonel 
Maulsby, of the " Potomac Home Brigade," Headquarters at 



220 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Frederic, and arrangements made for mutual support, should 
it become necessary. And so we waited and watched. 
8th. Our service has been a monotonous and weary one. 

By our watch-fires, dimly burning, 
The sods with our bayonets turning. 

There has n t been even the ghost of a Rebel raider to disturb 
our quiet. 

A despatch from Gen. Sullivan, informing us that the " 18th 
Connecticut will relieve the 34th," which is to " proceed to 
Martin sburg by the train which brings, the 18th," was received 
early this morning. A letter, delivered at about the same time, 
informed us that we were in bad odor again, at Division 
Headquarters. 

It seems that upon our departure from the Ferry for this 
place, Gen. Sullivan concluded that the streets leading to his 
quarters were too muddy ; and determined they should be at 
once cleaned. So an Orderly was despatched to our camp, with 
orders for the officer left in command to report to the General. 
Capt. Chandler reported himself, and Sullivan thus addressed 
him : " Captain, how many men have you in camp ? " " I don t 
know, General." " Well, find out then ! " "I don t know how 
I can, General." "Don t know how you can? I ll tell you, 
then. Have the roll beat ; the men all turned out ; count them, 
and report." So back to camp went Chandler, routed the boys, 
and found in line, under arms, 235. Reporting the result, the 
General, pencil in hand, delivered himself thus : " The Regi- 
"ment has 1,000 men; you report, in camp, 235; Col. Lincoln 
" has with him 534 ; that leaves more than 200 men unaccounted 
" for, and I ll be d d if I ll stand it. I ll get rid of you alto- 
" gether ; I ll send you to Martinsburg, and see how you will 
" like that." 

So by afternoon, down came the 18th Connecticut, with 
Boone, A. A. G., bearing orders for us to proceed, by rail, to 
Martinsburg on return train. 

We were nothing loth to try the change. At the Ferry, 
when the train stopped, request was made that it might be 
delayed long enough to enable us to send to camp for regi- 



"POINT OF ROCKS" AND MAKTTNSBTJRG. 221 

mental papers, shelter for the officers and our private property, 
and clothing, but this was refused, and we were hurried away 



o 

as we were. 



We left Capt. Thompson sick, in quarters, with varioloid ; 
and just caught sight of the faces of Lieuts. El well and Belser, 
who, with the members of our recruiting party, had returned 
that day. 

QtJi. Martinsburg. We reached this post, about 9 p. M., 
and marching on to the public square of the village, reported 
for orders. In the absence of the post commander, we were 
directed by his second in authority, to occupy the ground 
vacated by the 18th Connecticut, and were marched to the 
outskirts of the village, where, spreading our rubber blankets, 
we laid ourselves down for our night s bivouac. 

Col. Wells is appointed to the command of the post, and 
Acting Brigadier General, having for garrison the "116th," 
and 4i 123d Ohio," "34th Massachusetts," all infantry, "and 
the 5th (regular) U. S. battery. 

Wth. A careful examination in the early morning led to 
the selection of camping ground, apart from all the other 
commands, and never before occupied for such purpose. 

Our train came up to-day, and with it such of the command 
as had been left in camp at the Ferry. Our army of dogs 
and Company E s cow brought up the rear. General Orders 
assign Woods, our Adjutant, to be A. A. A. G. ; Capt. Chandler 
of F, to be A. I. G. ; Quartermaster Howland to be A. B. Q. M.; 
Dr. Clarke to be A. B. S; Lieut. Ripley. to be A. A. D. C. ; 
every officer, but one, on that staff, taken from our regiment. 
Lieut. A. C. Walker is detailed as Acting Adjutant, and Lieut. 
H. Bacon A. Q. M. of the regiment. Capt. Bacon has gone to 
Washington on a five days leave, to settle his affairs ; he per 
sisting in his purpose to resign. 

Our recruits are awkward enough, some of them. To aid 
them, the Inspector, as they step off, pronounces the words 
left, right ; left, right. One of them, on duty to-day as camp 
guard, thus soliloquized while pacing his beat : " Left, right, 
left, right from the country, and green left, right, left, right, 
left a d d good home." 



222 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Company I lost a man (Truesdale), to-day, very suddenly. 
Cause brain fever. 

Two more men of F received orders to appear before the 
Examining Board at Washington. 

Our Quartermaster has been notified by the proper account 
ing officers at Washington, that his accounts, filed for approval, 
are found to be incorrect, in this, that he has issued to the 
commissioned officers of the command three lead pencils in 
excess of the number to which they were entitled. His credit 
is dis-allowed to that extent, and pay stopped till the discrep 
ancy is satisfactorily explained. 

Apropos to this is the experience of two officers in neighbor 
ing commands. One, a Captain, almost constantly on the 
move, has failed to account for a Jiatcliet which had been issued 
to him, and was notified that unless he made proper returns, 
without delay, his pay would be stopped. Now what had be 
come of the hatchet the Captain didn t know, and couldn t tell. 
So he wrote back, asking the price of the article, and expressing 
his willingness to remit the required amount. To this he 
received a reply that " the department had no hatchets to sell." 
Whereupon he bought one, at the nearest hardware store, and 
forwarded it to the Quartermaster-General, with a letter ex 
pressing his regret that the government was so short, and 
concluding with a hope that affairs would go on smoothly, now 
that the missing hatchet was replaced. 

And another, a Lieutenant commanding, (who had long- 
neglected to attend to the repeated calls to send forward his 
accounts for the third quarter of 1863,) having been notified 
that he had been reported for neglect, and a request made to 
the proper authority to stop his pay, wrote back enquiring 
"what the proper authority said to the request?" 

1.1th. A storm of unusual severity is raging, and, spite of all 
our exertions, the men are suffering for want of suitable shelter 
and fires. 

Barr, of I, taken sick en route to this place, and left in post 
hospital at the village the night of our arrival, died to-day. 

Lieut. Platt, relieved as assistant Provost Marshal at the 
Ferry, joined his company, K, to-day. 



AND MAKTINSBTJRG. 223 

Thirteen recruits, from general rendezvous at Galloup s 
Island, Boston, Mass., also reached us to-day. 

Everything indicates the near approach of active operations ; 
and, in anticipation of a move from this place, the wives of the 
men are ordered from camp. 

Our requisition for tents has been allowed ; and we are to 
have an issue of new "A," or wedge tents. 

Capts. Potter and Thompson, recovered from varioloid, ar 
rived and reported for duty. 

12/i. Capt. Chandler, of F, has been appointed to the Lieut. 
Colonelcy of the 57th Massachusetts. The day previous, he 
had accepted the tender of a like position in Wild s D Afrique 
Brigade. Thus we lose, and the 57th gains, a most accomplished 
soldier and gentleman. A good deal of feeling has been roused 
in the regiment, by an order from the A. B. G., which "forbids 
" any officer of the command from visiting the village, unless 
"under a permit from his headquarters! " and in consequence, 
the officers of the 34th have been notified that no request for 
leave to go to the village will receive approval at Regimental 
Headquarters ; but that permits to leave camp at any time can 
be obtained from the Adjutant, by any officer, upon his leaving 
word at headquarters of the probable length of his absence. 

13/i. Dress parade was had at 4 P. M., that we might visit 
the " 123d Ohio, 7 and witness their manner of conducting the 
same ceremony, at a later hour. This regiment leaves to-mor 
row, to relieve the 116th, which has for four months past been 
distributed along the line of the I&gt;. & O. II. II. as its guard. 
At Winchester, under Milroy, last summer, it lost by capture, 
its Col., five other officers, and all but one hundred and fifty of 
its rank and file, and although the men have been exchanged, 
its officers are still- held by the Rebels. 

Their parade was more elaborate, than good. Line being 
formed, a company was detailed to escort the colors, which 
were received with all the honors. The manual, as such, was 
fair, the marching good, but the general appearance of the line 
bad. Hardly any two men on line, were dressed alike. 
Infantry frock coats, and blouses, cavalry and artillery jackets, 
with their yellow and red braid, and white, drab, yellow and 



224 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

black slouched hats, and the regulation cap, were all jumbled 
together. 

How our men have shouted, at intervals, to-day ! Sweeney, of 
C, wanted his wife, who has been with us almost since we first 
came out, to go back to Massachusetts, since she could no 
longer be allowed to remain in camp ; but she refused to go, 
and appealed to Headquarters. Although she could not be 
forced by the military arm, to go to Massachusetts, she Avas 
informed that the order excluding her from camp would be 
adhered to. In her rage, she threw into her husband s arms, 
her baby, and lie, poor fellow, as he totes the child back 
and forth in the camp, is subject to all manner of ridicule. 

These Avives have been doing a brisk business with us ; wash 
ing for the men, whom they require to furnish soap, and 
coaxing fuel and food from the Quartermaster, by the fiction 
winked at by the Capts., that they are company laundresses, 
their earnings have exceeded the pay of their husbands. And 
then, till now the family tie has been unbroken. No wonder, 
spite of the many inconveniences they endure, they hate to 
leave. 

Our iieAV issue of tents were received to-day. They are "A" 
shaped, about five by seA r eii feet, and by regulation, are to hold 
six men each. The camp lias been newly laid out, to corres 
pond with the new order of things. 

May 14cth. Gen. Sigel, now in the command of the Depart 
ment, is on a visit to the Post. 

Capt. Potter is appointed Provost Marshal ; Lieut. Lincoln, 
assistant do. 

The Pioneers are building stables for the horses of the 
command. 

Details from each company are putting up log cook-houses. 

Lieut. Macomber returned from his leave of absence last 
night. 

The Sutler joined us, and set up his tent to-day. 

They are setting up for state, at Post Headquarters; requiring 
the new officer of the day, when reporting for instructions, 
first to inquire Avhether the commander is ready and willing to 
receive him. 



"POINT OF KOCKS" AND MARTIXSBTJKG. 225 

We have had a detail of thirty men occupied all day in 
cleaning the Court House, which has been heretofore occupied 
by the garrison here, as Patrol Headquarters. The amount of 
dirt removed is perfectly enormous. 

Our orderly has brought in an unofficial note from Col. Wells, 
with information of the presence in the vicinity, of bodies of 
rebels, and advising precautionary measures for our safety ; and 
in consequence, Lieut. Goodrich, v?\i\\ fifty men, is sent to picket 
our front and flanks. 

15th. Capt. Soley and Lieut. Hall, returned from their visit, 
in Mass., last night. 

Capt. Pratt, and Lieut. Cobb, are the only officers away from 
the command, if we except those on duty at Post Headquarters. 

The former, temporarily incapacitated for duty in the field, 
by Aphonia, makes a model Provost Marshal, at the Ferry ; and 
the latter is still suffering from the wound received at Ripon, in 
October last. 

We hear, from the Ferry, that W T heaton, disgusted with life 
there, has applied to be returned to the Army of the Potomac. 
He was in a rage at the fact, and the manner of our removal to 
this place ; as, although attached to his Brigade, the orders 
directing our march to the Monocacy, as also from there hither, 
were issued to us direct from Division, instead of through his 
Headquarters. And when, upon a report reaching him that 
the rebels were threatening " Charlestown," he sent orders to 
the 34th to move in support of the troops at Hall town, his 
orderly returned, with information that the 34th was in Martins- 
burg, his language, in commenting upon the proceedings at 
Sullivan s Headquarters, is said to have been more forcible, than 
complimentary to that officer. 

And, in connection with the movement of our Brigade to 
this place, the following, told at Division Headquarters, brings 
a laugh from every one. Just previous to issuing the orders 
to the Brigade, Boone, Sullivan s A. A. G. wanted to communi 
cate with one of the officers whom he knew to bei n Baltimore. 
So the telegraph was called into requisition, and message after 
message despatched. But no acknowledgement was returned, 
and, in despair, Boorie thus broke out : " Adjutant, where the 



226 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

devil is your Col.?" " In Baltimore." "Are yon sure?" 
44 Yes ! " " Well, it s strange I can t reach him ! I ve tele 
graphed till I am tired." " Where to ? to the Eutaw and 
Barnum s? Pshaw! you don t know the ropes! see how quick 
I ll bring him." Send him that!" and the following message 
was sent over the wires : 

u Corporal Jones, at Guy s Hotel. 

" The Regiment is under marching orders. Return at once, 
or you will be reported absent without leave," and Corporal 
Jones, alias the Colonel, was on the next train. Pretty well, 
from an Adjutant to his Colonel. 

"LQth. Martinsburg is fairly groaning under the iron heel of 
its new Commandant. Every place of business is tempo 
rarily closed, and the town girdled with a chain of picket 
posts. All ingress, as well as egress, is for the time, stop 
ped. All trade is suspended, and to secure a removal of 
restriction, each dealer forwards for inspection, samples of the 
articles he has in store; so that Post Headquarters, with its 
cases of liquors, boxes of cigars, demijohns of brandy, jugs of 
wine, and cases and jars of jellies and preserves, looks like a 
-reat Sutler s caravan. 

O 

The citizens complain of our Patrol as more rigid than any 
they have been heretofore subjected to ; hard to be borne by its 
proper inhabitants who are thoroughly loyal, but well deserved 
by the large army of traders, blockade-runners, spies, bush 
whackers, etc., who make their temporary abiding place here. 

Sergeant King, most unexpectedly and unaccountably recov 
ered his voice to-day ; returning to him as suddenly as it was 
lost, it caused him no little surprise. 



CHAPTER XXIII. 



MARTINSBURG. 

LIEUT. COL. CHANDLER CAPT. F/S NEW UNIFORM CAMP 
NEWLY LAID OUT A WARNING- DETAILS THE SUT 
LER S ALE OUR DRILL AND PARADE CAPT. WIL- 

LARD MINER AND HIS BATTERY MARCHING 
ORDERS A STREET PARADE LIEUT. LIN 
COLN AND HIS FEMALE FRIENDS - 
MARCHING ORDERS AGAIN. 

~L8th. Capt. Chandler received to-day his commission as 
Lieutenant Colonel of the 57th Massachusetts, and was mus 
tered out of service with us. As he is to leave this Depart 
ment, he invited the officers of the 34th, with those of the 
other commands here, to a reception at Headquarters. All who 
were not on duty were anxious to attend. Among others, Capt. 
F. of ours, was especially desirous of being present. Of course, 
etiquette required an appearance in full uniform ; but the Cap 
tain, by some accident, had got one skirt of his uniform coat 
torn beyond repair. He had no change with him. For in obe 
dience to a recent order which required all line officers " to pack 
and send to the rear, all superfluous clothing," and prohibiting 
them from retaining any baggage save such as they could carry 
on their persons, he had kept only the uniform he had upon his 
back. And while he could not bring himself to attend the fes 
tivities in rags, he had equal difficulty in making up his mind 
to deny himself the enjoyment of the many good things he 
knew were provided for the entertainment. So, after due con 
sideration, he called upon the regimental tailor, and directed 
him to cut off both skirts of his uniform frock. Then arraying 



228 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

himself in this nondescript garment, neither cavalry jacket nor 
infantry blouse, he mingled with his brother officers. As the 
eagle eye of the Colonel fell upon the tall, commanding form of 
his subordinate, thus grotesquely arrayed, the following collo 
quy ensued: 

" Ah ! Capt. F., allow me to inquire what uniform you are 
wearing?" " Certainly; Colonel! Its the new pattern, pre 
scribed by the last general order for officers of this command." 
"Indeed, Captain, what order do you refer to?" "General 
Order No. - , these Headquarters, dated April - , 1864." 
" Are n t you mistaken, Captain ? Those orders have no refer 
ence to uniforms of any kind." "I beg your pardon, Colonel; 
here they are, and you ll see by reading them that I have con 
formed to the requirement, exactly." "Perhaps so, Captain, 
but I don t perceive the clause." "Why, look here, Colonel ; 
listen, if you please ! " and he read : "And all unnecessary bag- 
"gage and superfluous clothing shall be immediately packed and 
"sent to the rear," and for want of transportation, and because 
they were superfluous, I ve cut off my coat tails, and " " That 
will do," said the Colonel, as he joined in the general roar which 
followed, under cover of which the Captain was escorted to the 
refreshment room. 

ISth. The resignation of Capt. Bacon has, though with 
reluctance, at last been forwarded, approved. The proceeding 
cannot be justified by regard to the good of the service ; and 
can only be excused by the serious nature of the Surgeon s 
certificate, upon which it is founded. 

Lieut. Ammidon pleads for discharge, but with little chance 
of favorable consideration ; as business relations, merely, are at 
the bottom of his application. 

We have completed our camp, and it is quite a little gem. 
Each company has sixteen " A " tents. The company streets 
are wide, well graded, and crowned, with gutters on each side. 
The cook-houses are all of the same size, made of hewn logs, 
but varying a little in appearance by reason of a greater or less 
amount of ornamental work. Every one who visits the camp 
is full of praise, and showers upon us compliments for its 
beautiful and cleanly look. The only drawback is the entire 



MARTINSBURG. 229 

absence of water. All we use for washing and cooking is 
drawn by our teams, in barrels, from the creek, more than a 
mile distant. A well at the corner of one of the streets of the 
village furnishes a supply for drinking purposes ; but as the 
inner line of pickets is between it and the camp, there is some 
trouble in getting a supply from that quarter. 

Teirney, of A, arrested and sent to the Provost Guard House 
last August, and against whom charges were preferred for 
an assault upon the officer of our camp guard, arid who was 
subsequently tried, convicted and sentenced for the offence, 
was returned to-day by Gen. Sullivan s orders, for duty in the 
regiment; for the reason, as stated by the Provost Marshal, 
that the General was unable to find the papers in the case. 
Admission to the regiment was denied him, and he was 
returned to the care of the Provost Marshal. 

Our foot balls are worn out, and the bo} r s have turned their 
attention to wrestling matches, in one of which, this afternoon, 
Hubbard, of F was throw r n and had his leg broken. 

20/i. " Col. Stuart is on a raid, and may come this way, so 
be prepared to start at short notice;" so runs Col. Wells note 
just received. In consequence, we have had a general over 
hauling of our possessions ; have turned over to the Post Quarter 
master everything not absolutely required for present use, and 
stand ready to take a double quick to front, or rear, as shall be 
directed. Brigade Headquarters are all packed and ready to 
move if necessary. Our Cavalry pickets are so often found 
asleep on their post by the Officer of the Day, that we continue 
to picket our own front and flanks. Of the eight regiments of 
Infantry here, the 34th is the only one which takes any pre 
caution against being surprised ; some of the others not even 
mounting a camp guard. " What queer fellows you Yankee 

soldiers are," said Major K, of the Ohio, to-day. " Why, 

Major?" was asked. "Why! because here I have laid by 
your side for weeks, and in addition to your squad and company 
drills every forenoon, not a day has passed that you haven t 
been out for afternoon Battalion drill." " That s so, Major; 
and during the same time you have had no Company, and, with 
one exception, no Battalion drill. Will your men fight, Major?" 
18 



230 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" No, Colonel, I could n t trust them at all ; how about yours ? ? 
kt&gt; Why, Major, mine will go, or stand, where they are ordered, 
and will do, in any place, all that any men can do." " Well, 
that s enough*; I wish I felt that mine would." 

In answer to a requisition made by us months ago, we had 
issued to us to-day 1200 pairs of stockings, which are welcomed 
heartily by the boys, many of whom have been without, since 
January last. 

22d. Gen. Stahl has arrived, and taken quarters in town. 
Gen. Averill is about to leave on a raid. Sullivan is assigned 
to the command of an expedition to operate agairist the enemy 
from the " Kanawha Valley." This leaves Wheaton in com 
mand at the Ferry. We are called upon for a detail of three 
Sergeants, five Corporals, and eight privates, who, with a like 
number of men detailed from the other Infantry Regiments, are 
to form the u Engineer Corps of the 1st Infantry Division of 
the Army of West Virginia," under command of Lieut. Ma- 
comber, of ours. 

As these men, for all practical purposes, are to be lost to the 
Regiment, Commanding officers of Companies are cautioned to 
great discretion in making up their details. Our license system, 
or rather, the order under which our Sutler has been allowed 
to sell Ale to the men of the command, has thus far been 
attended with no objectionable result. Under the restriction 
of his order, his sales have been limited ; and, perhaps partly 
from, the less duty required of us, partly from change of weather, 
the health of this command has been steadily improving. The 
amount of drunkenness among the men has very sensibly 
diminished. But to-day, some of the boys, being without 
money, and wanting Beer, made a raid upon the Sutler s 
stores, and stole a cask of the beverage. The cask once secured, 
the question of interest was, how to get at the contents. In 
their impatience, the Boys knocked out the bung, and a stream 
of the creamy liquid, rising high in the air, betrayed them to 
the guard. Most of those engaged, sought safety in flight. 
But two preferred capture, and the attendant ills, to loss of the 
drink they had worked so hard to get. 

A roll call, ordered in each company, disclosed the names of 



31 A RT LN SBUKG . 231 

all absentees, who, as they return to camp, were provided 
quarters in the Guard Tent, where they will have ample oppor 
tunity for reflection. 

25th. A very severe storm is raging, as it has raged all day, 
the snow melting as it falls ; and, as a whole, the weather is, to 
use the language of the people here, quite "blustrous" Fuller, 
of F, a Corporal of ours, was discharged to-day, having re 
ceived his commission as Captain in the 39th U. S. C. Troops. 
In speaking of his examination, which was long and severe, he 
says, that when, to the question " where are you from?" he replied 
" the 34th Mass.," Gen. Casey, the President of the Board, 
remarked : " Well, sir, then you will have no difficulty with 
the tactics that Kegiment must be splendidly drilled." 

We are enjoying here the same high reputation we have had 
in the other places in which we have been stationed. 

21th. A large number of officers from the different com 
mands here, with a goodly number of ladies, honored with their 
presence our afternoon drill and parade. The officers of the 
oth U. S. Battery, (regulars) were especially profuse in their 
complimentary remarks. 

Our late muster rolls were returned to us to-day, by Lieut. 
Col. Moody, 139th Pa., who inspected us at the Ferry, bearing 
the endorsement, " that the 34th Mass, is the best Regiment for 
drill, discipline, and general appearance, I have ever seen." 

We buried one of H. s men in the village cemetery to-day, 
after a sickness of two or three days only. Poor Capt. Willard, 
of A, wants much to be married ; and asks for six days leave, 
in which to go to Baltimore and consummate the affair. But 
the powers at the head of affairs here, are hard-hearted old 
bachelors, and deny his request, and his grief at the refusal 
is heart-rending. We hear from the Ferry, that Miner is in 
trouble again. It seems that some of his men, having heard 
that an old resident was possessed of some money, way-laid 
and robbed him, beating him dreadfully. Sullivan, upon the 
matter being reported to him, was enraged. While deliberating 
in what way he should notice the offence, and dispose of the 
offenders, his attention was attracted by the noise of a rough-and- 
tumble fight, immediately in front of his Headquarters. Seizing 



232 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

his sword, he rushed on to the street, and laid about him with 
out mercy. As the combatants separated, his eye caught 
Miner s uniform on the person of one of the parties. " Adjt.," 
said the Gen., u send these men to the Provost Marshal ; and 
order Capt. Miner to report in person immediately." Miner 
put in his appearance ; and the Gen. thus accosted him : " Capt. 
Miner ! you are at the head of the most disorderly men I ever 
had to do with ; blackguards, all of them, and a disgrace to the 
service ; and I give you orders now, to take your command out 
of the Ferry, at double-quick time." u Where shall I go to, 
General?" "Go to! go to! Why go to hell with it, sir!" 

44 Go to h e 11! to h e 1 1, sir!! Shall I take my 

caissons there, too, Gen. ? " No answer was returned to this 
question, and the Capt. was soon after served with a written 
order to move on to Maryland Heights, where he now is. 

It is but fair to say that most of this command were long ago, 
in their individual capacity, on the road to the place first indi 
cated by the General. 

"29th. " The 34th Massachusetts will be ready to move at 
daylight to-morrow." Such is the order received late last even 
ing ; and upon enquiring, it was learned that our destination was 
the Ferry. The order was from Sullivan s headquarters. To 
resume our former service at that post, and under that officer, 
is to be aA r oided if possible ; and it is with no slight degree of 
pleasure that we learned, that upon receipt of the order at Post 
headquarters, Gen. Averill started in person for Cumberland, to 
get it countermanded. In the probability, however, that our 
stay in this place would be limited, a street parade was ordered 
for the afternoon. Our march was through the principal streets 
of the village, paying, as we passed in front of their lieadquar- 
ters, marching salutes to Generals Averill and Wells. The 
Regiment was drawn up in line, on the public square for the 
manual. 

Here were gathered Generals, Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels, 
Majors, Captains, and Lieutenants, of every arm of the service ; 
all uniting in the request for a dress parade. 

Averill, who had returned by noon train from Cumberland, 
came over, at the request of Wells. At the close of the parade 



MARTINSBUKG. 



we were complimented in the highest terms by the officers 
assembled ; Gen. Averill saying " that it was the most perfect 
thing of the kind he had ever seen." He also handed to the 
Lieutenant Colonel commanding. Gen. Sigel s telegram, coun 
termanding Sullivan s order for our morning s march to the 
Ferry. As the telegram was read by the Adjutant, the boys 
rent the air with cheer upon cheer. 

29th. It is a dull, dark, gloomy, dismal day, the rain falling 
in torrents, and the wind blowing a hurricane. 

Most bitter and unscrupulous of all rebels, are the females of 
this region; two of whom, under orders "to be sent beyond the 
lines " at this place, arrived here to-day from Washington. 
Lieut. Lincoln was detailed to execute the order, with express 
directions "to see to it" that they took with them nothing 
which Avould afford "aid and comfort to the enemy." The 
Lieutenant found these ladies surrounded by a group of sympa 
thizing sisters, who were 1 freely indulging in abuse of the Gov 
ernment and its officers. Announcing his object and his orders, 
lie was met by a storm of invective. His request for the keys 
to their trunks was laughed at. " Very well, ladies ; my orders 
to examine your baggage are imperative ; if I can t unlock your 
trunks, 1 must break them open." "Oh, go on, go on, Lieuten 
ant ! Break them open, by all means ! Carry out the decrees 
of your master ! It s so gallant to war upon defenceless 
females! As for us, we are not yet slaves to your tyrant, Lin 
coln ! " The blow upon the trunk, which impended, was 
arrested by screams of " There are the keys ! there are the 
keys ! " "I asked you, ladies, for the keys ; not that you should 
throw them on the floor ! " and up went the hatchet for a 
second blow\ " Now, ladies," said the Lieutenant, as he took 
the keys from the hand of one of them, and turned back tJie 
lid, " if you will be kind enough to unpack ! " " No ! no ! we 
shall submit to no such degradation." "All right ! " said the 
Lieutenant. " Orderly, empty these trunks." The Orderly, 
under the direction of the Lieutenant, was fast piling up articles 
deemed contraband, or within the order, as not required for 
personal use, when " How dare you, sir ? those are articles of 
wearing apparel ! " " Those," said the Lieutenant, "those 



234 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 



what I call hoop skirts. I see you each wear one. I allow 
you each a second one. These others I confiscate." 

"These packages of quinine I. think you won t need, and 
those bottles of brandy won t be absolutely necessary! if you 
will be good enough to repack what is left you, we can set out 
on our little journey ! " " The trunks were nicely packed once, 
sir; you have chosen to disarrange them, we shall have nothing 
to do with them!" "All right, ladies! Orderly, put these 
things back into the trunks, and those others into a bundle by 
themselves, and all into the ambulance ! And UOAV, ladies, all s 
ready, and we 11 go, if you please ! so, driving just beyond the 
picket line, and stopping near a dilapidated old building, the 
trunks were deposited by the wayside, the ladies were assisted 
to alight, and touching his cap, with a wish for a pleasant 
journey, the Lieut, turned and drove back to town. 

31s. Two companies of the 123d Ohio, left yesterday, bv 
rail, for the Ferry, and four more go down to-day. McCullough, 
of Sullivan s staff, called upon us to-day, with the not very 
pleasant imformatioii, that Ave were also to go, the Gen., being 
overheard saying to himself, "1 Avish I had the 34th back again, 
and I Avill have it. 

Our rain storm of yesterday changed during the night, to 
snow, of which there is now upon the ground, about six inches. 

Our sick list is ag^in quite large, and steadily increasing. 
Measles and mumps are the most prevalent diseases. A few 
cases of typhoid pneumonia exist, of very severe character. 

An order of the day from Brigade Headquarters, directs that 
i; Lieut. Col. Lincoln Avill move his regiment at 6 A. M., day 
after to-morrow, for the Ferry, with such transportation as may 
be furnished him" This order applies to the whole brigade, 
although there is now at that post, three 1 full regiments, and 
parts of two others, doing what the 34th alone has done the 
past six months. 

April 1st. Acting Brigadier Wells has gone to the Ferry, 
and his A. A. A. G. to the city of Baltimore. An order, re 
ceived early this morning, renews the marching orders of yes 
terday. Are we to march, or be transported by rail ? In the 
absence of the General and his chief of staff, no information 



MARTTNSBUKG. 235 

upon that head can be obtained. It is now, as it was yesterday, 
snowing, blowing, and raining, making it certain that our move 
ment tomorrow, if we are to march, is to be dreaded. If the 
enemy threatened, no command would endure the discomfort 
necessarily attendant upon the movement with more cheerful 
ness ; but, as it can be of not the slightest consequence whether 
we reach that place a few hours earlier or later, it is positively 
cruel to subject the men to such exposure. 

Lieut. Bacon, A. Q. M., despatched to headquarters to ascer 
tain, if possible, something as to our transportation, has returned, 
bringing the information that the A. B. G. will communicate 
with the regiment some time during the night. 

2d. 3 A. M. An Orderly has just handed in at headquar 
ters, the following: "Lieut. Col. W. S. Lincoln, commanding 
u 34th Massachusetts Infantry : You will march, with the regi- 
u ment under your command, to the Ferry, at the hour desig- 
" nated in previous orders from these headquarters, with such 
u transportation as shall be furnished you. 

u By order of the Col. commanding Brigade. 

" T. W. Ripley, A. I). C." 

At an earlier hour of the night, A. B. Q. Al. Rowland had 
taken from the regiment two of its four-horse teams ; and upon 
receipt of the above orders, a regimental general order was 
issued, directing that the wagons of the regiment would be 
loaded with first, officers* baggage and such private property 
as the men of the command might have ; second, with hospital 
supplies ; and, third, if room was left, with Quartermaster s, 
stores. The camp to be left standing, and a suitable guard 
detailed to protect it, and such government stores as we should 
leave behind.

APROPOS TO THIS E, LOST A MAN A 

NEW POST COMMANDER OFFICERS 

ASSIGNED TO DUTY. 

Harper s Ferry, April 3d. We are here, having marched all 
day yesterday, in the rain, and hail, and snow, through mud 
and water, in many places over the boot legs of the men ; and 
at dusk, when within two miles, and almost in sight *of our own 
tents, standing in their place, lying down in the cold and wet, 
without supper, by the order of our own Col. commanding the 
Brigade, to "bivouac in the first piece of woods we should 
" come to on the march, after receipt of his order." 

At 9 this morning, in obedience to orders same officer, we 
resumed our march, and have pitched our " shelters " near the 
" Lockwood House " ; the 18th Connecticut, now occupying our 
old quarters. We received cordial welcome from all ; particu 
larly Capt. Pratt, of ours, who is still Provost Marshal at the 
place, and Lieut. Cobb, as yet but partially recovered from his 
wound. 

Gen. Averill has gone to Washington, to prefer, in person, 
his request that we may be ordered to report to him, for duty, 
as " Mounted Infantry." 

The whole history of our march hither is so peculiar, and so 
much blame has been thrown upon the immediate commander of 
the regiment, for its unnecessary and cruel hardship, that it 



ON TH3&lt;: ROAD, AND AT THE FERRY. 237 

seems proper a full and connected account of it should be writ 
ten out. 

As already stated, on the 80th of March an order was issued, 
from Brigade Headquarters, directing " Lieut. Col. Lincoln, . 
" commanding the 34th Massachusetts Infantry, to march, with 
" his regiment to the Ferry, at 6 A. M. of April 2d, with such 
"transportation as should be furnished him." During the day 
of Friday, the Adjutant, and in the evening the Quartermaster, 
were despatched to Brigade Headquarters, to learn what they 
could of our movement ; if we were to march, and, if so, what 
amount of transportation was to be furnished us ; or whether 
we were to be sent down by rail, as we had been brought up. 
No one, better than the officers at Brigade Headquarters, knew 
how utterly inadequate to the transportation of the property of 
the regiment was our own four wagons. But all the information 
given them, was that the acting Brigadier had himself gone to 
the Ferry, and that, at some hour during the night, the Regi 
mental Commander would receive a communication from him. 
At a late hour in the evening, the acting Brigade Quarter 
master visited the camp. He brought with him an order requir 
ing the Regimental Quartermaster forthwith to turn over to the 
Post Quartermaster, two of the regimental teams, incidentally 
remarking, that probably the regiment would be required to 
march to the Ferry. He was asked what road we should take. 
" Oh, the Shepherdstown road ! " said he. " Yes ; but which is 
" the Shepherdstown road? You know, Quartermaster, that we 
"came up by rail. " "Well," said the Quartermaster, "you 
"know the Col. s Headquarters in town!" "Oh, yes!" 
" Well, when you get there, turn short to the right ; follow that 
" road and you can t miss your way." "All right ! Now, 
" Quartermaster, how many wagons are we to have, and when 
" are they to be furnished ? " " I can t tell you. I have n t 
" heard a word said about any transportation being furnished 
"you." And the interview ended. 

At a little past 8 A. M. of April 2(1, an orderly dismounted at 
Reg t H dqr s. and delivered to the hands of the Lieut. Col. com 
manding, an order from Brigade Headquarters, signed by A. 
D. C. Riplev, as follows: " You will march, with the Regiment 



238 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

under your command, to the Ferry, at the hour designated in 
previous orders from these Headquarters, with such transporta 
tion as shall be furnished you." Of course, this settled one 
point. We were to march; but how about transportation? In 
stead of any being furnished to us, part of our own had been 
taken away. When it was possible to delay no longer, orders 
were issued to load upon our remaining wagons, first, such prop 
erty as belonged to the officers and men of the command ; and 
second, hospital supplies and articles necessary to be had on the 
march, such as axes, shovels and picks; and at the latest possible 
moment, as no transportation was furnished, the cam}) Avas or 
dered to be left standing, a suitable guard being detailed for 
its protection, and for the care of all Government property left 
behind. 

And so, at precisely 6 A. M., in a driving storm of Avind, rain, 
hail, and snow, the Regiment filed on to the road, and moved 
towards the A illage. As the head of the command entered the 
public square of the town, the form of the Acting Brigadier 
was recognized at the Avindow of his H dqr s. Although in 
heavy inarching order, and moving in a drenching rain, " atten 
tion" Avas called, and the honor of a marching salute Avas paid 
him. This honor was acknowledged by him. Turning 
short to the right, as Ave passed his quarters, the UCAV direction 
of march, conforming to information given by his OAVU quarter 
master, Avas taken, while he stood viewing our ranks. No effort 
was made to correct this error. .Before Ave had proceeded far, 
the road Avas found to be difficult for the men, and impractica 
ble for the teams. A halt was ordered, and the Adj t sent back 
to report. "Tell (V&gt;1. Wells, Adj t, that his Q. M. pointed out 
this road as the one for us to take; that there must have been 
some mistake about it, as we find it impassable for our teams. 
Say to him, also, that I don t know in what direction to turn, 
and ask him for directions, and also for a guide to pilot our 
route." Now, the Wagoiim aster rode up to report that one of 
his Avagons had broken down, and must be abandoned. Lieut. 
Lincoln Avas despatched to Headquarters to repeat the message 
sent by the Adj t, and to report the accident. 

Both these officers soon returned, reporting the delivery of 



OX THE EC) AD, AND AT THE FERRY. 239 

the messages they were charged with, and the reply made by 
the Acting Brigadier himself, that " he no had directions to give, 
and no guide to furnish us." 

In this dilemma, the officers were called together. "Can any 
of you lead us to the Shepherdstown road?" Xo one could do 
so. " Maj. Pratt, yon have been tield officer of the day! can t 
yon point out the route? " He could n t. " Well, then ! can 
any one of you lead us to the Winchester Pike?" The Major 
could do that ; and although this route was not without its 
danger, from an occasional Rebel raiding party, it had an 
advantage, in that it gave us a good McAdani, instead of a dirt 
road, on which to inarch. 

So, with an order to the Quartermaster to turn his teams, 
and join us on the Pike, the regiment IblloAved the lead of the 
Major, through the mud of the intervening iields. .No teams 
were to be seen when we reached the Pike, and the Adjt., was 
sent off, on the road to the village, to hurry them up. The 
storm was raging with terrible fury. It was too seveVe to endure 
while on a halt, and the march was continued, but with slack 
ened pace. While thus toiling on our way, looking back 
frequently in hope of seeing our wagons, a horseman was 
discovered riding furiously towards us. As he neared, he was 
recognized as Lieut. Ellis of the brigade staff. Drawing rein, 
he saluted. "Col. von will turn over to Maj. Pratt the com 
mand of the ;J4th, and report in person to the Acting Brigadier 
without delay." Maj. Pratt met the surrender of the command 
with the significant question. " \Vhat am I to do with it. Col?" 
" I wish I could tell you. Major! My orders were (and they 
are still in force) to inarch to Harper s Ferry. The road we 
started upon was pointed out, by the Acting Brigade Quarter 
master as the right one to take; you saw that it was impassable 
for our teams; Col. Wells was informed of our situation, was 
asked to &lt;_nve directions for our route, and to furnish a miide 

o 

to pilot us on our way, both of which requests he has denied. 
"We are here under your guidance; the road we are on leads 
through Bunker Hill, to the Ferry. Jf 1 was still in command, 
1 should follow it, but the regiment is now in yo.ur hands ;" 
and so saying, the Lieut. Col., wheeling his horse, started for 



240 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Headquarters. On his way into town he was met and passed 
by Lieiit. Ripley, A. A..D. C. on the brigade staff, exchanging 
salutes with him as lie galloped by. Entering the office of the 
A. A. A. (I. and making known to that officer the reason of his 
presence, an orderly was directed to notify the fact to the 
Brigadier. 

After some little delay the Lieut. Col. was ushered into the 
presence of that officer. A warm, and somewhat angry inter 
view followed. Somebody at Brigade Headquarters had 
blundered. Orders intended to be given, by which transporta 
tion and guides for our route were meant to be provided, had 
not in fact been issued by the staff, and the regiment and its 
commander were the sufferers. With a promise that orderlies 
should report to him as guides, and an injunction to keep the 
men of the command out of Martinsburg, the Lieut. Col. was 
dismissed, with orders to "go back and take his regiment, 
getting on to the Shepherdstown road without delay, and 
march his men to the Ferry." "What, to-day, Col.? you can t 
mean it/ "I don t care when you get there, but if you halt, 
send an orderly forward to report that you are on the road/ 

Rejoining the Regiment, it was guided through fields, across 
ravines, to the bridge over the Opequan, and the " Shepherds- 
town road/ where the promised orderlies were in waiting. 
We had now been on the march more than five hours, and were 
thoroughly drenched and chilled through. Our onward prog 
ress was slow, as our road was deep with mud. 

Corning to a piece of thick woods, a halt was ordered, with 
the intention of going into bivouac ; but the officers, after con 
sultation together, knowing that our old camp at the Ferry was 
standing, in the hope of being allowed to occupy it upon our 
arrival, preferred to continue the march. 

Capt. Bacon, who was suffering from lameness from an injury 
to his ankle, and Lieut. Lincoln, were mounted, and directed to 
push on to the Ferry, and report our near approach to Head 
quarters. They were also furnished with a requisition for cof 
fee, and instructed to have it ready for us upon our arrival. 
For the first time, in our service, an official request was made 
that a ration of whiskey might be issued to the command. 



OX THE EGAD, AND AT THE FERRY. 241 

And so, floundering through the deep mud, our march was 
continued. Some irrepressible spirits, among the older soldiers, 
would break out in occasional song, or beguile the way by call 
ing out "co-boss, co-boss" whenever a tired recruit would 
straggle from the column. 

Just before reaching Halltowii, an Orderly rode up, bearing 
an order from our own Colonel, Acting Brigadier, directing us 
to u bivouac in the first piece of woods we should reach, after 
" receipt of his order." Leaving the Pike, which we had now 
struck, we filed to the right, and made our night s resting place 
in the wet and mud, near our winter s chopping ground, on the 
Lucas estate ; within a half hour s march, and almost within 
sight of our own old home on " Camp Hill." 

The whiskey asked for was soon afterwards delivered to us, 
by " Tom" A. A. D. C., who rode into camp astride the barrel. 

There was no such thing as comfort to be obtained under the 
circumstances ; and all welcomed the morning, which broke 
fair and beautiful. 

At about 9 o clock, an order from the authorities at the Ferry, 
directing our immediate march thither, was hailed with cheers, 
and obeyed most willingly. We found the 18th Connecticut 
nominally occupying pur old camp; and, in obedience to direc 
tions, we pitched our " shelters " near the " Lockwood House." 
Here, without the means of procuring a fire, even to cook with, 
the wind blowing a gale, and another storm of mingled snow, 
rain, and hail raging, we passed the afternoon and following 
night. 

8th. Yesterday s storm raged all night, but is now mod 
erating. 

The property and stores of the 18th Connecticut have been 
collected and carefully stored by the Brigade Quartermaster, 
and orders from Post Headquarters permit " the 84th to take 
possession of their old camp." Our men, left at Martinsburg, 
as guard over our camp and stores, having been relieved by the 
19th U. S. Colored Troops, rejoined us to-day, having come by 
rail. 

Lieut. Clive, Signal Officer from Sigel s Headquarters, is in 
camp to select two of our Lieutenants for duty in that Corps. 



242 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Capt. A. L). . Pratt, on duty as Provost Marshal at this post, 
who still suffers from "aphonia/* is desirous of resigning; but 
his tender is peremptorily rejected. 

Major H. W. Pratt is off duty from the effects of our inarch 
fro m M a r tin sb ur g . 

Capt. W. P&gt;. Bacon is suffering from the same cause. 

We have also three men in hospital, down with lung fever con 
tracted at the same time; one of whom, the surgeons say, will 
certainly die. 

" Well, Flaiiley ! " said Lieut. Klwell, our Jate recruiting offi 
cer, to the man, a miserable old shirk, who had lived in the 
Guard House most of the time since he joined the regiment: 
** How do you get along?" &gt;k Indeed, Lieutenant, I Avish my 
throat had been cut before ever I saw you in Worcester." 
"Why, you ought not to complain, Flaiiley; you ve done no 
service since you came out!" "Service is it, you say. Lieuten 
ant?" u Yes, Flaiiley, service! You ve done none; you ve 
been in the Guard House three-fourths of your time!" " And 
faith, then, Lieutenant, wlio d do the policing, if there wasn t 
some of us there?" asked the old rogue; and the roar his retort 
drew forth, more than repaid him for all the hardships he com 
plained of. 

1th. Our Colonel is assigned, by General Orders of yester 
day s date, to the command of this post. Another of our men 
has received a commission in one of the regiments of colored 
troops. 

Lieut. Khvell, of F, has tendered his resignation, feeling ag- 

O O &lt;^ 

grieved at the promotion of First Lieut. Chauncey, and the 
assignment of that officer to the command of the Company 
with which he (Klwell) lias been identified. He is reconciled, 
in a degree, by the assurance that such action was taken not 
from any want of regard for himself personally, or from lack of 
appreciation of his good service as an officer. He is reminded 
of the fact that to prevent any questions of precedence in rank, 
all commissions of the original line officers Avere made to bear 
the same date : and of the standing regimental order issued, at 
an early day, by the Colonel of the regiment, and which the 
Lieutenant Colonel could neither countermand or disregard, 



OX THE ROAD, AND AT THE FERRY. 243 

that no officer, under any circumstances, would receive promotion 
to a vacancy existing in his own Company. I may say now, 
farther, that which could not so properly he said to him, that 
upon the vacancy caused by the discharge of Capt. Chandler, in 
consultation with the Colonel, and at his suggestion, Lieut. 
Chauncey was recommended to the Governor for promotion, 
instead of Lieut. Elwell ; and this because of the existence of 
the order above alluded to. * Of course that rule should be re 
garded. 1 should not think you d hesitate a moment; Chaun 
cey has been doing first rate of late," were the words of the 
Colonel; and I acted in accordance with them. E. was notified 
distinctly, that his resignation would not be considered with any 
favor, and I hope will be reconciled to, if not satisfied, with the 
situation. 1 " We cant afford to lose him. He is too ood an 

c"&gt; 

officer. 

Lieut. R. YV. Walker s resignation was forwarded, ""approved." 

W e Q ad our first drill to-day since leaving Martlnsburg. 

The 1.9th IT. S. Colored Troops, Lieut. Col. Perkins (late 
Captain 1st Connecticut Volunteers), commanding, of which 
Lieut. Pennell, late Sergeant Co. E, 84th Massachusetts, is act 
ing Adjutant, created a sensation as they marched past our 
camp today, from Martinsburg. They had been "raiding" the 
country for recruits, and while in M. gobbled about thirty 
volunteers. 

The process they adopt to secure new members is as novel as 
it is successful. Encamping in some neighborhood where the 
" darkey " element is strong, they send out a scouting party, 
which gathers in its embrace all u gentlemen of color " it may 
meet on its rounds. Upon returning to camp, these "brothers" 
are committed to the guard-house. Here they are left awhile, 
to meditate upon the uncertainties of life ; they are then con 
ducted to the presence of an officer, designated for the work, 
who calls for " volunteers in the holy cause of freedom and the 
country." Generally, some of the party are ready to respond 
to the call ; and their names are made at once to grace the rolls 
of the Regiment. These poor fellows are, without delay, 
clothed in regulation blue, and turned over to the drill master. 
There are some, however, in whose breasts the spark of patriot- 



244 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

ism has not yet kindled to a burning fire, and such are returned 
to the guard-house for longer meditation. In this way, time is 
the great agent in bringing all, who fall into their hands, to a 
realizing sense of their duty to "volunteer." 

The 18th Connecticut and 5th Xew York Artillery (about 
2,500) reached here to-day. 

9th. Brigade General Orders of even date, direct a rigid 
daily inspection of each command; require that "each soldier 
shall have at all times, and shall carry in his knapsack, one extra 
pair of draAvers, one extra flannel shirt, two extra pairs of socks, 
two extra pocket handkerchiefs, one extra pair of shoes, one 
rubber, besides one woolen, blanket, one overcoat, one-half shel 
ter tent," and permits sewing materials ad libitum, and "writing 
paper and envelopes, not to exceed a pound in weight." Add 
to this, one s musket and equipments, forty rounds of ball car 
tridges, and three days rations, and each man becomes -a fair 
sized walking army wagon. 

#th. Apropos to this order : At a late inspection of a com 
mand, the inspecting officer examined the cartridge boxes of his 
men ; a thing he had not done for a long time. Coming to one 
known as an inveterate card player, and who had used his 
box as a storehouse for candles, the remnants of a good many 
of which were still remaining, he broke out thus: "Step 
one pace to the front ! Xow, who are you, sir? *" " Corporal 
lones, Captain." " Corporal Jones, is it? By the powers, but 
it s mistaken ye are ! It s Company Cook, bedad ! YouVe got 
grease enough in that box of yours to butter cakes for every 
man of us, ye have ! " And again, to another, who perhaps 
wrote home as often as some of our officers, and whose knap 
sack was pretty full of letters : " Who are you, sir ? lie pleased 
to step one pace to the front, and show yourself! Who are 
you ? Sergeant Blake, is it ? Bedad, you are no Sergeant at 
all ! I think ye must be the Secretary of War, or, indeed, old 
Halleck himself, by all those letters ! " 

E lost a man last night, under the following circumstances : 

A large detail from the Company was on duty at the Shenan- 
doah bridge ; and, as has beeir the custom, at nightfall the floor 
ing of the bridge was removed, thus cutting off all commuriica- 



OX THE JtOAD, AND AT THE FERRY. 245 

tion between the sentinel at the eastern approach, and the 
relief on this side, except what could be had by walking along 
a plank stretched across the chasm thus made. 

The night was very dark and stormy ; the wind was blowing 
and howling furiously, and the water of the river running like 
a mill-race. 

At the hour for posting the relief, the Corporal of the Guard, 
with Hunter, of "E," a capital fellow and splendid soldier, 
started to walk this plank. The Corporal passed safely, not 
missing Hunter till he had reached the other bank. Hunter 
fell, or was blown from the plank, and was seen no more ; nor 
is there any trace of his body this morning. Falling from 
twenty-five to thirty feet, and weighted, as he was, with mus 
ket, equipments, and ammunition, he probably sunk at once. 

llA. The water in both the Potomac and Shenandoah has 
been rising rapidly for the past few days, and a large detail from 
the Regiment has been employed in freeing the bridges across 
these rivers from the drift which has accumulated against them. 
But this morning finds the bridges carried away, and one span 
of the railroad bridge gone, thus cutting off all communication 
north and east. Brigadier General Max Webber reached here 
to-day, and assumed command of the Post, relieving Colonel 
Wells of that duty. He returns Capt. Potrer, acting Provost 
Marshal, at his own request, to duty with his Company ; and 
substitutes in his place Capt. A. D. Pratt, who is still suffering 
from aphonia. He also takes Adjutant Woods, of ours, to be 
A. A. A. G. on his staff. 

Our friends, and now oar neighbors of the 18th Connecticut, 
amuse us a good deal. When they were ordered to this post, 
after we were so summarily sent off to Martinsburg, with our 
camp standing, and all our &gt; property unpacked," they moved 
upon a "good thing," occupying our quarters, luxurious and 
clean beyond all their imagining, (to judge from their own camp 
ground, at M., to which we were consigned, where the filth was 
beyond endurance). Upon being returned to this post, we 
longed to re-possess our own again, and asked and obtained 
leave to do so, inasmuch as almost that entire regiment was 
away on duty. Now, upon their return, they hunger and thirst 
19 



246 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

after what they have lost; and stand lounging round our streets, 
leaning upon their muskets, indulging in ill-natured criticism of 
us and our doings. 

" D d paper collar soldiers, these fellows are," one says to 

another ; " no wonder they beat us in parade and on drill ! 
That s all they have ever done! Only let them have one 
fight ; just put them on a march, and then see!" The fun of 
the thing comes in when we reflect how little these fellows 
have shown themselves to be worth ; doing Provost duty, at 
Baltimore, for a year ; then at Winchester, with Milroy, last 
July, where all who could do so, skedaddled ; and those who 
could n t, marched to Richmond with all the honors of an 
armed escort. 

In consequence of the destruction of the railroad bridge, all 
trains from the west are detained at this point ; and U. S. 
Senator Carlisle, and other dignitaries in Civil, and officials 
in Military life are gathered here. We are notified that our 
" parade " is to be honored with the presence of Gen. Webber, 
with his staff, and other gentlemen, and in return for this com 
pliment, it is ordered to be had with dress coats, scales and 
sashes.

The " 2d Brigade " has fizzled ; and Wells, again plain 
Colonel, has left for Baltimore. Heavens ! what a babel in 
camp ! Company F is tearing down its old cook-house ; and by 
the help of our dogs, of which we have an army, its men are 
having a rat hunt; one hundred and fifty-seven of the creatures, 
by actual count, now lying piled in one heap. Among these 
dogs are a few brought from home when we came out ; more 
which have been confiscated by the boys, at the different 
stations we have occupied ; and not a few coaxed into following 
us on our different marches. Some howl at every bugle call ; 
all bark in chorus when the drum corps makes its presence 
known by its unique performances. Many are regular in 
their attendance at all drills, and one of these sings second, 
whenever our Colonel s voice is heard delivering his words 
of command. Some fall in regularly, and march in line for 
their rations ; others, guerrilla like, hang on to the flanks, 
making stealthy approach to the cook-houses, and steal, and are 
off. Noble New-Foundlands, wiry terriers, mastiffs, hounds, 
pointers, bull dogs, poodles and mongrels of all kinds and 
degrees. Our stock has increased miraculously of late, and 
what with the regular howlings and irregular fights, over 



248 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

which it seems as if the boys luxuriate, as over nothing else, 
interference came from Headquarters, at last, in the- shape of an 
order. The fightings were made to cease, but the dogs 
remained until to-day, when the boys have corralled all they 
could coax, and have turned them loose again, with tin decora 
tions to their tails. Well, they must have some fun ; and if 
there is no whiskey in it ! 

Capt. Leach returned to us to-day, having, gallant soldier that 
he is, captured a wife during his absence in Massachusetts. 

All applications for furloughs are returned from Superior 
Headquarters, disapproved, and notice given that none will be 
granted at present. 

Well ! what s to pay now ! It seems as if bedlam had broken 
loose. Hark! what a roar! now a lull, during which the soft, 
sweet notes of our band fall with soothing influence upon 
the ear ; now a shout drowns all other noises ! The devils ! 
They are hunting down every man they lay their eyes upon, 
and giving all they catch a tossing in their blankets ; showing 
particular attention to such ones as look down contemptuously 
upon "such employment of their God given faculties." 

Chaos seems to have come again ! Orders crowd fast upon 
orders: now from Gen. Webber, "commanding the Post,"- 
now as "commanding the 1st Infantry Division," now as 
"commanding the Independent Brigade." Some come through 
an apparent intervening Headquarters, some are sent down 
direct some are addressed "to the Commanding Officer of the 
34th," some to "Col. Wells," some to the "Lieut. Col. 
commanding." In the seeming confusion, one hardly knows 
"whether he is on foot or on horseback." 

Our garrison is being strengthened; the 116th and 123d Ohio 
marched by us to-day, and encamped in Bolivar. One battalion 
of the 5th N. Y. Artillery is to bivouac to-night, on the glacis 
immediately in front of our breastworks. Miner s Battery is 
recalled from the hot quarters given it by Gen. Sullivan. 
Thus reinforced, we are to " have, in the future, Brigade Guard 
mounting upon the parade ground of the 34th Massachusetts ; 
the band of that regiment furnishing the music." 

16th. A heavy rain has been falling all night, and is still 
continuing. 



HARPER S FERRY AND MARCH TO MAKTINSHUIK;. 249 

" General orders, Headquarters 1st Infantry Division, Depart 
ment West Virginia," received this morning, direct the forma 
tion of a brigade, to be composed of the 34th Massachusetts, the 
116th and 123d Ohio, with the 3d Maryland (Snow s) Battery, 
the whole under Col. Wells, A. B. G. The brigade is ordered 
to take up its line of march, for Martinsburg, at 9 A. M., to-mor 
row. 

Heaven help us ! Except the 34th, this Infantry is neither 
drilled nor disciplined ; this, however, from no fault of theirs. 
The bulk of the rank and file of these commands was captured 
at Milroy s defeat, last summer. The men were paroled soon 
after, and have been scattered in small squads, along the B. & 
O. Railroad, on duty as picket guard. The officers, however, 
were retained as prisoners; and many of them are, in fact, 
still in Rebel hands. It looks as if we were to suffer from the 
connection. 

Capt. Pratt, Provost Marshal, and Lieut. Lincoln, on court 
martial, both still victims to aphonia, are to be left behind. 

Our sick list is somewhat large, and we have a good many 
men unable to march, from various causes. Among these is 
Capt. Bacon, not yet recovered from the effects of our late march 
from Martinsburg. He is to be left in command of the camp 
arid its guard, charged to pack, and forward by rail, such prop 
erty as we cannot take on our wagons. 

18th. Yesterday s march was severe, principally because of 
the deep mud of the roads. Our guide, well acquainted with 
the country, took many a short cut across the fields, thus avoid 
ing much that was horrible. 

At 5 P. M. we reached " Kearney-ville," and went into 
bivouac, in a beautiful grove of oak timber. Our Pioneers soon 
had a log heap, twelve to fourteen feet long, along each side of 
which the officers stretched their shelters. By the aid of the band, 
to which we all owed much, the evening passed pleasantly ; many 
officers from the other commands gathering around our fire, 
and helping, by song and story, to wile away the hours. Reveille 
was sounded the next (this) morning at 5 o clock, and at 7 we 
were again on the march. Hearty and repeated cheers were 
given to the 34th, as the regiment, on its route through the vil- 



250 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

lage of Martinsburg, was recognized by the inhabitants. It is 
pleasant, now, to listen to their words of welcome. While they 
confess to a degree of dissatisfaction at the rigor of our patrol, 
they also confess that they had no reason to complain of any 
act of incivility on the part of the boys ; and least of all, of 
suffering from petty plundering, as they have suffered since our 
departure. We passed, on our march into the town, Averill s 
command, which was taking passage by rail to the Kanawha. 
General order No. 2 appoints Capt. Potter, of ours, as Provost 
Marshal of the place ; and directs a " daily detail from the regi 
ment, of three commissioned, and ten warrant officers, with sixty 
men, to serve as Provost Guard." 

Lieut. Cobb, although not recovered from his wound, rejoined 
us, and reported for duty. 

19/i.. Col. Wells is relieved from command of the Brigade, 
and assigned to the command of the Post. An alarm last night, 
called the Regiment to arms. In three minutes, the Boys stood 
in line, ready for any emergency. Capt. Leach, with his Co., 
G, was sent out to picket the " Tuscarora road ; " and Capt. 
Fox, with his own (H) Company, and B, moved to the Win 
chester Pike, to support the Cavalry pickets which were reported 
to have been driven in. Four Companies of the 123d Ohio were 
sent out, to-day, to picket the country in the neighborhood of 
" Sleepy Creek." 

Permission has been given Capt. Leach to appear before the 
Examining Board, at Washington, upon his application for a 
position, in the field, of some " colored Regiment." Charges 
have been preferred against Capt. Bacon, by a Lieutenant of 
the 18th Connecticut; and a copy has been forwarded to the 
Captain. The offense, charged, is that the Capt. knocked down 
a man of that command, before leaving the Ferry ; and the 
Captain s history of the affair is this : 

It will be remembered,- that upon our reaching the Ferry, 
after our march from this place, we found the 18th Connecticut 
in nominal possession of our old camp ; and, that, as their occu 
pancy was but nominal (all of the Regiment, save a small 
guard, being on duty elsewhere,) our application to re-occupy 
the camp was granted. When orders were issued, directing 



HARPER S FERRY AND .MARCH TO AIARTINSBURCJ. 251 

our march to this place, inasmuch as we could not take with us 
the property belonging to the Regiment, and that for which the 
officers were responsible, it was determined to leave the camp, 
and the public property in charge of a competent guard, under 
Capt. Bacon, who was partially disabled. When the fact that we 
were to move became known, these men of the 18th sniffed the 
plunder from afar. Like vultures, they swooped down upon 
our encampment, waiting only our departure, that they might 
pounce upon the prey. Officers and men alike envious to 
excel in this work of appropriation. As these fellows paid no 
attention to Bacon s orders to them, to desist from their plund 
ering, he knocked one of them down. The 18th, or so many of 
them as were present, "made for him." His guard surrounded 
him, and he, revolver in hand, threatened to shoot any one who 
resisted his authority. The 5th X. V. Artillery, under orders 
to occupy the ground vacated by us, were now marching in ; 
and, upon complaint preferred b}^ the men from Connecticut, 
the Col. of the New Yorkers directed Capt. Bacon to consider 
himself in arrest. 

" But I don t recognize your authority to give such orders/ 
said the Capt. 

u Then I will cause you to be placed in arrest," replied the 
Col. " 1 guess not, Col. ! Do you command the Post ? " " No, 
Capt.!" "Then you can t arrest me. I am Capt. Bacon of 
the 34th Mass., left by Col. Lincoln, commanding the Regi 
ment, in charge of this camp, and, if any person attempts, in 
any way, to disturb me in the performance of my duty, I will 
shoot him, on the spot ! " " That, Capt., entirely alters the 
case, and I apologize to you for my threat," said the Col., and 
so the affair dropped for the time. 

But not long afterwards, Bacon detected one of the Connec 
ticut officers walking off with a chair, and a table belonging to 
one of ours, and ordered him to return it. Connecticut 
demurred; Bacon called a guard; Connecticut, depositing his 
coveted prize on the ground, and seating himself, said : u I 
guess, Capt., I can sit here as long as you can stand there." 
* fc Shoot any person, Guard, who attempts to carry away either 
table, or chair," said Capt. Bacon, as he turned and walked 



2o"2 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

away. For four long hours the Connecticut officer kept his 
seat, the guard maintaining his watch the while. At length 
the officer effected an ungraceful retreat, with a loss, not only 
of the coveted spoils, but the honor of the foray. After our 
train was loaded with the most valuable, and indispensible 
articles, what remained were given, by Capt. Bacon, to the 
officers and men of the 5th N. Y. Much had been obtained at 
no considerable money cost ; all of it under some difficulties, 
and, taken as a whole, was a prize of high value to any com 
mand. It is no strained inference, that, but for this loss of 
their expected plunder, we should have heard nothing of these 
charges against our Captain. Meanwhile, Bacon is not, nor will 
he be placed in arrest ; and with the forwarding of counter 
charges preferred by him, these Connecticut Officers will learn 
that in War, blows are given by both sides. 

"21st. Camp was disturbed at a late hour last night, by the 
receipt of an order directing a .large detail to march at once 
out on the "Tuscarora Road " to picket that region. Cause : 
the hanging round of a large body of Rebel cavalry dressed in 
our uniform. Lieut. Murdock in charge, is this morning, upon 
complaint of Lieut. Col. Wilde, 116th Ohio, field officer of the 
day, placed in arrest, by the commandant of the post. By the 
Lieut. s written report, forwarded, approved at Regimental 
Headquarters, it seems, that in obedience to the orders he 
received, he established his reserve about three quarters of a 
mile from our camp, throwing out small posts in front, -and on 
each flank ; that having thus secured himself against surprise, 
he rejoined the reserve, and, leaving his Sergeant in charge, 
laid down, giving orders that he was to be called in case of 
need ; that lie was notified of the presence of the field officer of 
tlit 1 day, but did not deem it necessary to get up, and go out to 
meet him. And the Lieut, charges in turn that this officer of the 
day, neither saw to the placing of the pickets, nor visited them 
after they were placed, but contented himself with riding up 
to the reserve. 

*2*2d. Upon the report of Lieut. Murdock, that officer is 
released from arrest. Lieut. Hall has, at length, been detailed 
from the regiment, and ordered to the Signal service. His own 



HARPER S FERRY AND MARCH TO MARTINSUURG. 253 

remonstrances, and the utmost efforts of the Lieut. Col. com 
manding- were ineffectual to avert the transfer. Sullivan s 
expedition, tip the Kanawha, is abandoned, in consequence of 
the bad state of the roads in that region ; and the troops, 
composing the 2d brigade, are now coming by rail to this post. 
The 5th U. S. battery has arrived, and Averill s command are 
en route. Sigel holds us as in a vice, refusing all applications 
for furloughs, and returning "disapproved," every paper, no 
matter what its nature may be. 

A joke, particularly a good, one, is relished in camp, as 
nowhere else ; and if it happens to be at the expense of a 
superior officer, the enjoyment is not at all diminished. 

Our Col., just now acting post commander, good soldier that 
he is, is also a good deal of a martinet, and we are all enjoying 
a laugh at his expense. A Sergeant of the 123d Ohio, has 
charge of a picket post on the Winchester Pike, with the most 
stringent orders as to his conduct ; among them being one to 
detain at his post any one, from outside the picket line, desiring 
to come into the village ; allowing them however to forward 
to the commandant of the post a written communication, stating 
the object sought to be accomplished by the visit. Upon 
learning his orders, the Sergeant requested an allowance of pens. 
ink, and paper, to enable him to carry his instructions into 
effect. This application, to all seeming proper enough, was 
refused. Matters went well till this morning, when, for the 
first time since being on post, a countryman presented himself 
with the purpose of visiting the town. In the quandary in 
which the Sergeant found himself unable to obey equally 
unwilling to disobey his orders lie sent the man forward, under 
charge of a guard to report at Post Headquarters. Now the 
breacli of orders by the Sergeant was so flagrant, that the Col. 
ordered his immediate arrest, and directed that he should be 
brought before him personally for examination. tfc How hap 
pens it, Sergeant, that you have disobeyed my orders?" "I 
couldn t help doing so, Col. ! " " Couldn t help it ! You meant 
to disobey, did you ? " " No, Col., but I had no rations and so 
could not keep the man at my post; neither he, nor I had 
writing materials, so I could not comply with your orders. 



254 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Therefore I sent him up under guard, that lie might communi 
cate personally with von." 

" Yes, but Sergeant," said the Colonel, " there are stores open 
in town where you could have supplied yourself with paper, 
etc." 

"Ah! yes, Colonel, that s true enough; but it s no part of 
my duty as a soldier to furnish writing paper to the govern 
ment ! On the other hand, it furnishes me. I have so much 
pay, and am found ; my pay is not only small, but overdue." 

And the result was that the Sergeant was returned to his 
duty, after being furnished with a large supply of writing mate 
rials ; and, for once, as the boys have it, " the Colonel had to 
come down." 

24:th. Corporal Adams, of E., died last night ; another vic 
tim of that " dreadful march " from this place to the Ferry. 
Matthews, also of E., a recruit, has been passed, by the Exam 
ining Board, at Washington, to a Lieutenancy in the U. S. 
Colored Troops. 

We, that is, the commands here, find ourselves just now in a 
regular " muddle." Averill, who was leaving this place as we 
arrived, directed " Col. Taylor, of the 1st N. Y. Veteran Cav 
alry, to assume command of the Post; " Col. McReynolds claims 
the command, by virtue of seniority of rank ; and Col. Wells is 
in actual enjoyment of the position. Each, in turn, issues 
orders, not always, however, in harmony with each other, and, 
at times, no little confusion is the consequence. 

%vth. The Colonel, relieved from command of the Post, 
returned to-day to the head of the Regiment. 

He marked his arrival by the following ; 

HEADQUARTERS 34TH MASS. INFANTRY, 

Martinsburg, April 25, 1864. 
" REG. GEN. ORDER, No. 40. 

" The Colonel, upon returning to the Regiment, after nine 
"months separation from the immediate command, congratu- 
" lates it, and himself, upon the able and efficient manner in 
* which it has been commanded during the time ; and the faith- 
- ful devotion to duty of its officers, and the admirable conduct 



HARPER S FERRY AND MARCH TO MARTINS BURG. 255 

4 -of the men. It has been his chiefest happiness to see it grow- 
" ing in grace, and good works, and winning golden opinions in 
" every quarter. He does not quite know, yet, whether it is the 
" best Regiment in the United States service, but he does know 
" that it shall be. 

" By order of GEO. D. WELLS, 

" Col. 34th Mass. Infantry. 
"A. C. WALKER, 

"Acting Adjutant." 

After a two hours Battalion drill, conducted by himself, he 
relinquished the command to the Lieutenant Colonel, desiring 
the officers to be notified to put and keep their companies in 
condition to march at a moment s notice. 

Gen. Sigel and Staff visjted the camp during the afternoon. 
Two Colonels also rode over to see us, both of whom are senior 
in rank to our own. Inasmuch as they, with their Regiments, 
are among the late arrivals at the Post, their presence caused 
Wells no little disgust, and the rest of us no little dissatisfaction. 

Dr. Charles G. Allen, lately appointed Assistant Surgeon, and 
assigned to us, vice Thorndike promoted, reported for duty. 

At 11 P. M. the camp was disturbed by the marching away of 
two Companies, I and G, Capt. Soley in command, sent out to 
support one from the 123d Ohio, on picket at "Harrison s Gap." 

The Rebels are increasing their strength, and gradually draw 
ing nearer to this place. A scouting party of our Cavalry was 
captured by them, yesterday, between " Middletown " and 
Winchester. 

26th. Our supporting party marched, last night, in darkness 
almost tangible, and in a storm of unusual severity. After their 
departure the wind rose, and blew with great fury, and the rain 
fell in torrents. Col. Wells left, this morning, for Cumberland, 
having been detailed as a member of a " military commission," 
to assemble in that place. During the day, the regiment was 
inspected by Col. Thoburn, 1st West Virginia Infantry, detailed 
to the duty from Sigel s headquarters. It was the fourth in 
spection in as many days, by virtue of orders same headquarters. 
Companies I and G, returning from their night s duty on picket, 



256 THIRTY-FOUKTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

caught sight of the regiment under arms, and came into camp 
on a " double quick." They were ordered into column, for 
inspection, as they were anything but fair to them, but perhaps 
quite as well for the credit of the command. The condition 
of these two companies, just off duty, during a night of rain 
and exposure, without previous knowledge of the pending 
inspection, and, of course, with no opportunity of preparing for it, 
drew from the inspecting officer the highest praise. A few 
young men of " C," and two or three in one of the other com 
panies, were found without " drawers " in their knapsacks, as 
required by late general order, and were ordered, by the In 
spector, to the " Guard House." He refused to accept, in expla 
nation of the apparent disobedience of orders, the statement 
that never in their past life had they worn such articles of 
clothing, and consequently they had not now been required to 
draw them. He claimed that they were not thereby relieved 
from obligation to draw for, and carry them in their knapsacks. 
However, they were not committed to the Guard House, as 
ordered by him. During the inspection, our camp was thronged 
with officers, of all grades, and every arm of the service. The 
crowd was largely increased by persons of both sexes, as the 
hour for our " parade " drew near. At the close, a Major in 
the 21st N. Y. Cavalry, a Massachusetts man, who introduced 
himself, said "it made his heart bound to see the old White 
" Flag supported by such a regiment. I do n t mean to flatter 
"you," said he, "but I have been in the U. S. service since grad- 
" uating from the Military Academy. I have seen the Dress 
"Parades of nearly every regiment of the regulars, and of, I 
" don t know how many, of the volunteer service; but this of 
" yours excels anything of the kind I have ever seen." Though 
proud as Lucifer at the compliments showered upon us by this 
and other officers, I contented myself with the remark that I 
believed we might safely call the 34th a well drilled body. 
" Well drilled ! " was the exclamation all around ; "well drilled ! 
It s perfect ! it s perfect ! " 

The Rev. Mr. Longley, who has been with us for some weeks, 
has at length made known his desire to be appointed our Chap 
lain. At a meeting of the officers, called for the purpose of 



* 

HATCPEH S FEKRY AND MARCH TO MAETIXSBURG. 257 

considering the matter, it was decided, after discussion, not to 
extend to him the desired invitation. 

27th. 4 A. M. We were roused at the above hour this morn 
ing, by a pleasant voice, announcing, "Dispatches for you, Colo 
nel, immediate and pressing/ They communicated the in 
formation that "the enemy, in force, at about ten the past 
evening, had driven in our outer picket line ; and ordered " all 
infantry commanders to hold their forces ready to move at a 
moment s warning." Endorsing upon the back of the order an 
acknowledgment of its receipt, according to the new order of 
things, I, being tired and half sick, laid down and slept. Not 
a safe thing to do, as a general rule ; but we had our rear, 
front, and flanks protected l&gt;y our own men ; and more confi 
dence was felt in their watchfulness than in the correctness of 
the information, which it had taken Headquarters six hours to 
obtain and communicate. The result justified the conclusion, 
as no camp was disturbed. 

An order for "Garrison review, by Major-General Sigel," in 
person, issued yesterday, directed the troops to " be on line at 
2 p. M., of " to-day. Our distance from the place designated for 
the ceremony was four miles. As the head of the regiment 
rose the hill east of the village, near where the review was to 
be had, no other troops could be seen. A halt was ordered, and 
the staff sent out to explore ; but soon returned, having failed 
to gain any information at the neighboring camps. Soon an 
Orderly cantered up, with directions from Col. Thoburn, A. 
B. G., to the 34th, to " take its assigned place." " Where is 
that ? " was asked. " I don t know" was the reply ; and so the 
regiment remained where it was. Now the 54th Pennsylvania 
appeared; and, nearing us, was also halted. Soon the two Ohio 
regiments came up. But among us all, no one knew more than 
that there was to be a review, somewhere in that neighborhood. 
And so we rested, as and where we were. An hour passed, and 
an A. D. C. brought orders for us all to move "farther over the 
hill, and take position upon guides stationed there." We 
moved, to find the order was wrong. Five times we moved 
upon lines and to positions designated, only to be ordered else 
where as often. While affairs were thus muddled. Gen. Sigel 



258 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

and staff arrived upon the tield, but rode away to the cavalry, 
which were drawn up upon our extreme right. During their 
absence, Col. Thoburn, with the aid of the several regimental 
commanders, succeeded in getting his line formed. The review 
itself went off well enough, and we returned to camp at about 
6 P. M. 

Col. Wells returned from duty in Cumberland by the mid 
day train, and rode on to the field in season to direct the regi 
ment in its various movements. ( )ur old friend, Gen. Sullivan, 
reached here to-day. Report assigns him to the command of 
the Infantry Division. 

*28th. The 18th Connecticut reported last night. 

Commissions reached us, to-day, for Capt. Chauncey, and 1st 
Lieutenant Platt, and 2d Lieutenant Cutter, and they were 
assigned to duty accordingly. 

Orders have just come down, directing the march of the 
troops at 5 A. M. to-morrow ; the men to take five days rations 
in their haversacks. We shall leave behind, Capt. Pratt, Lieuts. 
Woods, Lincoln, Platt, and Horton, all on duty at the Ferry ; 
Van Loan in command of our Provost Guard here, and Cobb 
and Cutter in command of the sick, left to guard our camp and 
property. Macomber, detailed to the command of the Pioneer 
Corps, is attached to Sullivan s headquarters.

April 30th. Bunker Hill. We reached this place about 4 i. 
M., yesterday; distance marched about twelve miles. The 
weather had changed from being uncomfortably cold to very 
warm, and the men suffered a great deal from the heat. At 
the first halt of the column, knapsacks were unpacked ; contents 
closely examined, and the ground fairly covered with abandoned 
clothing. In some instances, overcoats were thrown away; in 
many blankets were divided, and one-half left, that the heavy 
burden might be lightened. To-day has been taken up in must 
ering for pay. We have (including the three officers and one 
hundred and twenty-three men left on duty at Martinsburg, but 
mustered as present with the regiment) twenty-nine officers and 
eight hundred and thirty-eight enlisted men. Of this number, 
three officers are on special duty, and thirty-seven men on extra 
daily duty, and one enlisted man sick. Nine Commissioned 
Officers are absent on duty, three of whom are away from the 
division. One hundred enlisted men are on detached service : 
four absent with leave ; one without leave ; thirty-six absent, 
sick; and fourteen away from the division. Fifty recruits are 
required to bring us to our maximum number. Major Gen 
erals Sigel and Stahl, and Brigadier General Sullivan, and 



THIKTY-FOrRTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Colonels and Acting Brigadier Generals Moore and Thoburn 
are with the column. 

It is the general impression that we are to await at ^Winches 
ter instructions from Grant, and the hope is strong, at least on 
the part of many of the officers, that we are not to advance far 
up the Valley. We are here, twelve miles from our base, with 
a train of over two hundred empty army wagons, and the animals 
without forage ! Banks, Fremont, and Shields have each, in 
turn, been driven from this Valley; and our present force is a 
smaller one than either of those Generals commanded. With 
all this, and the experience of Milroy the past summer, Sigel, 
with his present force, will be lucky indeed if he also does not 
have to " get out of this." The country passed over is some 
what rough and rocky; yet the soil is excellent. But there is 
little evidence of improvement, No orchards, (a few scattering 
apple trees only) not even a currant bush has been visible on 
our route hither, although we have marched past some princely 
estates, and are in the " Garden of Virginia," as this Valley 
is called. 

Large, square, two-story buildings, mostly of brick, without 
blinds, unsheltered from the blazing sun, stand in the fore 
ground ; and around them, the invariable cluster of uncouth, 
rambling log stables, generally unenclosed. 

We hear and read of u free and enlightened Virginia," yet to 
this time we have nowhere seen a " country school house." 
There are " academies " indeed, where the children of the rich 
and "well born" can be educated; but for the poor and those 
of moderate means ! God help them ! Virginia has not ! 

Winchester, May 3d. Our march of yesterday was less 
fatiguing than that from Martinsburg to Bunker Hill. As we 
moved through the streets of this place quite a number of Union 
flags were suspended across the street ; and more, of smaller 
size, were waving from windows of houses, along our route. 
Occasionally handkerchiefs were waved by fair ladies; but more 
often, scowling faces, not always bearded, could be seen looking 
from behind half closed doors. We are encamped outside the 
town, upon ground more than once hotly contested for. 

Our officers, high in place, do not enjoy the full confidence 



261 



of the command. The two Acting Brigadiers if they are to 
be judged by the condition of their own regiments and is not 
such a fair test ? are poor soldiers. 

Three of our eight regiments of infantry were with Milroy at 
his surrender of this place, over a year ago ; and the men of 
each of these regiments accuse those of the others of misbeha 
vior on that occasion. The 54th Pennsylvania is fair ; the 12th 
West Virginia pretty good ; the rest are barely passable. In 
excuse for these others, it may be truly said, that such as were 
captured at Winchester had been without officers till a short 
time ago, and that they have been subdivided into small detach 
ments, doing mere picket duty along the Baltimore and Ohio 
Railroad, with little opportunity for even company, and none 
for battalion drill. Such as it is, however, the column is here; 
threatening the occupation of the Valley, to create a diversion 
in favor of Grant perhaps to remain where we are perhaps 
to advance and occupy the country; certainly not, it is hoped, 
with the purpose of advancing beyond " Cedar Creek." Orders 
have just come down for a brigade drill. We shall now see 
what we shall see. 

May 4th. General orders of yesterday reduced our transpor 
tation from six wagons to three, and every individual to 
" fighting trim ;" the men being directed to pack all spare 
clothing in their knapsacks for transportation to Martinsburg, 
where they are to be stored; and the officers required to reduce 
their baggage to one small valise each they to carry their own 
blankets on the march. Soon after the receipt of the order, a 
train was driven into camp to be loaded, and such a moving 
"you never did see." When everything directed to be sent 
back had been loaded on to the wagons, there was almost 
nothing left for future use. About midnight, with great noise 
of cracking whips, and loud shouts of "yah yip, mule!" the 
wagons were rolled out of camp, but were recalled after being 
driven about two miles, and are here now. In the distribution 
of camp equipage, one wall tent falls to the Colonel; the 
Lieut. Colonel, Surgeon, and his two Assistant Surgeons 
luxuriate in the joint possession of another, while the Adjutant, 
Quartermaster, and their clerks, enjoy a third. Our Major, 
20 



262 THIKTY-FOUKTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTIiY. 

having been detailed as A. A. I. G., on Gen. Stahl s staff, is, 
presumably, to be better accommodated. 

Look at us now ! All chairs and stools having been sent 
back, and tables, and other conveniences of camp life having 
vanished, we are seated upon the ground, and eating our 
dinners from dishes balanced upon our knees. The Adjutant 
writes his orders upon a drum-head, on paper which his clerk 
carries in his coat pocket, and with pen and ink which he 
carries on his own person. In our tents, ranged in order, are 
our saddles, covered with our overcoats, poor substitutes for 
pillows. Carefully disposed near by are swords, belts, spurs 
and glasses ; while hanging from the tent poles are haversacks, 
canteens and bridles for our horses. Each man s blanket lies, 
snugly rolled, upon ground where, when spread, its owner is to 
find his bed. 

Stripped naked as we are of all carnal comforts, there is one 
thing we have in abundance. We fairly revel in red tape. For 
instance : Word was sent in from our left wing, out on picket, 
that one of our men had been suddenly taken severely sick. 
JJnder our former status, our Surgeon, upon receipt of such 
information, would have procured an ambulance and driven 
out and brought in the man. But under the existing arrange 
ment he reports, in official form, the fact to the Medical 
Director; the Medical Director, endorsing said report, forwards 
the same to the Medical Inspector ; this official, first endorsing 
said report, forwards the same to the officer commanding the 
ambulance train ; this officer forwards it to the Lieutenant in 
charge of the train; the Lieutenant directs his Sergeant to have 
the man sent for ; the Sergeant directs his chief of ambulances 
to send for the man ; the chief directs the driver of some one 
of the many ambulances to " hook up," and report ; the driver 
" hooks up " and reports, and there being no one else to be 
directed, the man is in a fair way of being brought in. In this 
case, fortunately the man had a strong constitution, and was 
alive when reached. 

Since our arrival here, we have drawn all our supplies from 
Martinsburg, using for that purpose the train of wagons belong 
ing to that post only ; and notwithstanding this train fails to 



SIGEL S CAMPAIGN. 263 

bring up the quantity needed from day to day, over two hun 
dred and fifty wagons stand corralled here, idle and empty. 
We have already had one train captured from us by the Rebels, 
near Bunker Hill. 

The troops are pretty busily occupied in Company and Bat 
talion drills, and in an indescribable sort of Brigade move 
ment ; this last under the supervision of Sigel, Stahl and 
Sullivan, who are on the field, but who, as a rule, exercise no direct 
command. These Brigade drills, if such they may be called, 
are full of novelty to us, so different are they from any in which 
heretofore we have taken part. Yesterday, for instance, every 
thing was full of the mimicry of battle. Artillery was posted ; 
Infantry massed in column, and extended in line ; and Cavalry 
stationed so as to protect the flanks. Everything looked beau 
tifully ! A line of skirmishers was needed to cover the front ; 
and the 34th was singled out. " Your Regiment is drilled as 
" skirmishers, Colonel ? Yes, General. And it moves by 
" bugle call? Yes, General. 4 Ah, well; that s splendid! 
wt Send your bugler to me." Various calls were sounded, by 
order of the General, to which the Company, sent forward as 
skirmishers, promptly answered in responsive movement. Rap 
port having been thus established, the entire Regiment was 
ordered to deploy as skirmishers. A " Forward " blast from the 
Bugler, simultaneous with an opening discharge from the Artil 
lery, close in our rear, sent us ahead ! How fortunate for us 
that this was playing war ! and the guns unshotted ! as other 
wise our loss would have been fearful. During the movements 
of the troops, our advance was unchecked. Looking backward, 
we could see the sub-divisions of the main army rapidly chang 
ing position. Artillery, hastily limbering, made quick retreat ; 
and, from its new position, swept, with furious discharge, the 
ground it had been forced to surrender. Infantry went gal 
lantly forward, and charging, regained lines it had previously 
held ; while Cavalry swooped down, in impetuous charge, upon 
an enemy supposed to be in confusion. And so the afternoon 
sped. The struggle behind us must have been terrible ; for so 
engrossed with it, and the varying fortunes of the field, were 
its managing spirits, that the existence of the line of skirmish- 



264 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

ers seemed to have been forgotten. Over fences, through 
swamps, across ravines, and in wood-land, past the outer picket 
line, in strict obedience to that single " Forward " blast, occa 
sionally dropping a Bugler to catch and transmit to us any new 
call, if any should be sounded at the far away battle field, we 
pushed our way on. As, after a while, the tired soldiers of the 
main army rested on their arms, the day s casualties footed up, 
killed, none ; wounded, none ; missing, the 34th Massachusetts 
Infantry ; all but that one Bugler whose blast had carried us so 
far away. 

Couriers skurried over the country, and overtook us moving 
ahead, obedient to that first and only order. Now, our own 
Bugler sounded the "recall;" and when our wearied boys 
marched into camp, it had long been dark. 

Lieut. Bacon is detailed from us to duty as A. 13. C. on Col 
onel (Acting Brigadier-General) Thoburn s Staff. 

Dr. Clarke, who, upon the organization of the 2d Brigade, was 
appointed, and has been acting Medical Director, was returned 
to-day, and rejoined us. He looks as if delighted at getting 
back ; and we are rejoiced that he is again acting with us. 

The weather is very changeable ; uncomfortably, almost 
oppressively warm by day, and cold enough in the evening, 
and at night, to make fires almost a necessity. Chills and 
diarrhoea are quite prevalent among us, though we have no 
serious sickness as yet. 

Col. Wells is reported on the sick list. "Take your Regi 
ment," he said to the Lieutenant-Colonel, this morning; "take 
your Regiment and do with it what you please. I ve lost all 
interest in it and the service," a remark induced, perhaps, more 
from a sense of injustice done him, than from actual ill health. 

1th. Five companies of ours were sent out, this morning, on 
a three days tour of picket duty. 

Major Pratt left us to-day to serve as A. A. I. G. on the 
staff of Major-General Stahl. 

Writes the Lieut. Col. under this date to a friend : " I have 
been quite unwell for several days, though not 4 off duty; and 
this morning feel quite down-sick, and have been vainly try 
ing to get rest and sleep. Among others who have dropped in 



STGEL S OAMPATOX. 265 

upon me,* has been the Col. Upon his departure, Clarke picked 
from the ground, a paper, and handed it to me, with the remark : 
here s a paper you have dropped, Col. Opening it, I saw that 
our Brigade was under orders for a drill this afternoon." " Well* 
Col. ! " I asked some hours afterwards, as I handed the order 
back to him, " what time have you ordered the line to be 
formed this afternoon ?" "I ve given no orders," was the 
reply. "What time will you have it formed?" "I ve no 
orders to give about it." " But, Col. ! one of us must take out 
the Regiment, as the Major is detailed away; and Jfeel too sick 
to do it." " I am sorry for tliat, Col.," was the reply ; " but I 
won t serve under such fools ; and you are a fool if you do." 
Just then, the drums, in the other Regiments, beat " to the 
color." But of course all was quiet with us. At last, but not 
till the 1st Virginia was moving from their camp, I ventured 
again to the Col. s presence, to ask what orders had been issued. 
" None ! so far as I know," said he. " What orders will you have 
issued, Col. ? The other Regiments are under arms, and some 
of them already moving on to line," " I ve no orders to give, 
Col.," said he. " Do with your Regiment just what you please." 
So I turned upon my heel, directed the Chief Bugler, near by, 
to sound the assembly, the Boys responded with a cheer, and, 
moving at a double-quick, the 34th stood on its appointed 
place, the extreme left of the line, second in point of time. As 
I rode past the Col. s tent, his " Where s your glass, Col.? I 
think I ll go up to one of these knolls and watch the affair ! " 
arrested me, only long enough, however, to give him the infor 
mation he asked for. Soon, Sigel, Stahl, Sullivan, Moore, and 
Thoburn, A. B. G., in actual command, each accompanied by 
their full retinue of staff officers, rode on to the field, and to the 
extreme right of the line. Riding from Regiment to Regiment, 
and halting at each, this imposing Cavalcade, after a long time, 
drew near the 34th, and the following colloquy ensued : " Col. 
Wells?" "No, Gen.!" "Where is Col. Wells?" " He is 
indisposed." "Col. Lincoln?" "Yes, Gen.!" "Can you 
handle your Regiment, Col.?" " I ll try, Gen. ! " " I ask the 
question, Col., because we are going to practice some move 
ments, this afternoon, sometimes required upon battle fields, in 



266 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

which every thing depends upon Battalion Commanders ; and, 
that there may be no mistake in execution, we have come down 
to explain, in advance, the orders and movements. I ll now 
give the orders, as I shall issue them, and you will please to 
give close attention. " The first movement, Col., will be to 
change front to rear, upon your Battalion. The order, for this 
movement, you will not repeat to your command." (In this he 
was wrong.) " Next I shall give the order to wheel by Com 
panies, to the left. This order you will repeat; next, u to close, 
by Battalion in mass, upon the head of column ; " which order 
you will also repeat ; next, right face Now, presuming this 
to be a slip of the tongue, merely, I ventured to interrupt with 
" excuse me, General, you mean left face, don t you ? " " That s 
precisely why I ve come down here ! I don t want any sug 
gestions from Battalion Commanders ! All I want from them 
is to listen carefully to the orders, as they are issued, and to 
repeat them, precisely as they are received." " You shall have 
no reason, General, to complain of me in that respect ; but, at 
the same time, you will please excuse me for saying that your 
order, right face, will not be correct." "I don t want any sug 
gestions from you, Col. ! The order will be right face, and I 
shall expect it will be obeyed," was the remark of the General, 
somewhat impatiently made. " Most certainly, Gen., it shall 
be," was the reply ; and the interview ending thus, the Generals, 
with their retinue, wheeled, and swept to their places in front 
of the line. Soon, but in a voice too faint to be heard in the 
distance, Order No. 1 was issued. As I sat with closed lips, I 
could hear my officers enquiring " what s the order ? what s 
the order?" but regarding the instructions I had received, I 
gave no intimation of the intended movement. 

We wheeled to the left, by company, as directed. At the 
order to " Close by battalion in mass upon head of column," the 
regiments to our rear closed solid upon us, and upon each other, 
wholly failing to maintain their proper intervals. Nor was this 
error noticed; or, if noticed, was it corrected, by either the 
proper battalion, or any of the general officers. Just then 
some of the line officers of the 34th, among them Capts. Bacon 
and Soley, inquired what the movement was to be ; and upon 



STGEL S CAMPAIGN. 267 

being informed, they, with their brother officers in command, 
instantly, and in advance of the issuing of any general order, 
gave to their men the cautionary word, "Left." No notice 
was taken of this action by them. The look upon the faces of 
these officers, as they heard from my lips the order, " Right!" 
in repetition of it as it fell from the mouth of the officer com 
manding, caused me to smile. It said plainly enough : " What s 
the matter with you, Colonel ? " Aware that each of my sub 
ordinates knew as well as myself that the order, as issued, was 
Avrong, and fearing lest they, concluding that it was a slip of 
the tongue on my part, would execute the correct movement, I 
shouted the order, " Right face ! " once more, which they, in 
turn, repeated to their astonished men. At the head of the 
column, as we were, we changed position in a moment. But 
the other organizations, after marching to the new line, were in 
a sort of "town meeting" condition. It was perfectly plain 
that they recognized something wrong in their position ; and it 
Avas equally plain that none of the officers kneAV how to remedy 
the error into Avhich they had been led. They Avere extricated 
at last, by the aid of the general officers. When, after a long 
Avhile, the new line Avas formed and order restored, the caval 
cade came thundering doAvii to us, " What s the matter here- 
Coloriel?" "Nothing, General." u Well, what s the trouble? 
It doesn t seem quite right to me." "Nor to me either, Gen, 
eral." u Well, then, what s the matter Avith you? " " Nothing 
at all, General, as I said before. Only ive are in by inversion, 
companies, as well as the regiment!" " By inversion?" 
" Yes, General. We were the extreme left. We are now the 
extreme right regiment ; and my companies stand in line in the 
same manner I " * Well, Colonel, can you get your regiment 
back on its original line, as you \vere ? " u Yes, General." 
" Oblige me, then, by doing so. Wait, if you please, till I 
resume my place, and then give your orders in a loud and dis 
tinct tone, so that all may hear ; and Avhen you are in position, 
I 11 bring in the rest of the brigade." Obedient to the new 
orders, which Avere issued in as loud and clear a tone as Avas 
possible, our boys moved in a tAvinkling, and "rested in place." 
And then, such a tOAVii meeting again ! With much counter- 



268 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

marching, and indescribable confusion, and after long waiting 
on our part, the brigade was once more aligned. The whole 
affair brought forcibly to mind the trials of one of our Captains 
in the early days of our service. Worthy fellow that he was, 
getting confused one day at his inability, on drill, to handle his 
men " a la militaire," he gave gave them the easily understood 
order, " Find your places, boys ! " 

Again I straightened up to receive the general officers, who, 
after halting in front of the other regiments, came riding down 
upon us. 

u This time, Col., we 11 have a different movement ! We 11 
advance by battalion, in echelon, at sixty paces, commencing 
the movement on the left ; " and turning he rode away. Upon 
the receipt of the order " march," the 34th stepped forward. 
Turning to observe the alignment of the command, my ear 
caught the sound of a horse s feet, as the animal was Hearing 

me, at a gallop. Lieut B , A. D. C. saluting, thus addressed 

me. " The General s compliments, Col., and wants to know 
what you are doing." " My compliments to the Gen., Lieut., 
and tell him I am marching, as ordered ; " and each of us rode 
our respective ways. The foot-beat of another galloping horse 
warned me of another approaching messenger, who put me the 
same question, and received the same answer. As he was 
wheeling to ride off, each of us saw Headquarters approaching 
at a rapid pace, and both of us rode forward. " How came you 
to be marching, Col. ? " " Because of your order, General." " But 
you had no order, Col." " Excuse me, Gen., I thought I had. 
Your order directed a movement by battalion, in echelon, at 
sixty paces, the movement to commence on the left, and as the 
34th was on the left, at the word march, I set my men in 
motion, as I ought." " No Col., you are all wrong; to have 
executed the movement properly, you should have advanced 
sixty paces, and halted-, then the regiment on your right, should 
have moved sixty paces in advance of your new position, and 
halted in its turn, and so on through the line." " Pardon me, 
Gen., if I persist that I am right, as I could satisfy you, easily, 
if there was time." " You shall have time enough, Col.; you 
will report yourself at Headquarters, this evening. And now 



SIGEL S CAMPAIGN. 269 

you will halt, face about, and march your men in this direction ; 
and when you are where I want you, I 11 give you orders to 
halt." I was sincerely desirous of obeying, and had no idea 
of showing the slighest disrespect to my superior officers. 

Impressed with the fact, that, under the new directions given 
us, I was to march my men to some unknown spot, in their then 
rear, I shouted to the regiment, far in front, the order, "Right 
about, march /" "What s that, Colonel ; what s that order? 
There is no such order in the book!" " Oh, yes, General !" 
" No, Colonel, you can t find any such order in the school of the 
Battalion ! " " But I can, General, in the school of the Com 
pany; and I have used it because it is adapted to the move 
ment you directed." " Yes, but, Colonel, there is a proper way 
to do these things ! You should have first halted your com 
mand ; then faced it to the rear, and then taken up your march 
in this direction." " T have been taught, General, the very 
great importance of rapid movements by infantry. Had I ordered 
a halt, every officer would have attended, at once, to dressing 
his line ; then at the "About" they would have done the same 
thing again; and so a good many minutes would have been 
wasted ; whereas, by the order actually given, the march to the 
rear was taken up without the loss of a second of time, and the 
line was dressed while the march was progressing." While 
thus engaged in conversation, the regiment, in its new direction 
of march, reached and passed the ground we occupied, and the 
A. B. G., without indicating, in any way, the spot where he 
desired the regiment to be halted, rode away, leaving me to 
rejoin my command. And so, almost instantly, the previous 
scene was repeated. Staff officers galloped, as if for life, with 
the General s compliments and a desire to know what I was 
doing; to gallop back again, with my reply, that I was march 
ing, having received no order to do otherwise. This brought 
matters to a crisis ; and I soon received and issued the welcome 
order to " halt." . The line was now re-established, and all of 
us were enjoying a rest, while the general officers were occupied 
in riding from the right, stopping at each regiment to exchange 
words with the officers at their head. Our turn came at length. 
"Colonel," said the A. B. G., as he reined up at my side, "on 



270 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

the whole, this has been a very satisfactory drill ; but it is very 
hot this afternoon, and the remaining hours had better be 
devoted to Battalion movements ! " " Do I understand by that, 
General, that the 34th is dismissed to my command ? " " Cer 
tainly, Colonel; and I congratulate you upon having so splendid 
a regiment ! v and he rode off to the head of his own old regi 
ment. Under all the circumstances, the excessive heat of the 
weather, and our own universally conceded superiority, I felt no 
disposition to burden the boys with much battalion drill ; so, 
moving to the shade of a neighboring grove, arms were stacked 
and the men allowed to rest. Wells now came up ! " How are 
you, by this time, Colonel, and what have you been about? 
Where s your brigade drill ? I have seen a movement or two 
by the 34th, as a battalion ; and a good deal of running about, in 
a confused sort of way, by the other regiments; but where is 
your brigade drill ? " The state of affairs, as above written, was 
explained to him. "And so the rest of the afternoon is to be 
devoted to battalion movements ! But I have n t seen the 34th 
engaged in any, of late ! " " Why, yes, Colonel, the 34th 
is now engaged in the important one of resting" And so, lazily 
we spent the time, till suddenly Wells exclaimed, " You re in 
for it, Colonel ! " and pointed towards the body of general offi 
cers who were dashing "from the far off right, straight down 
upon our position. To seize our arms, and gain our encamp 
ment, at a double quick, was short work. Moving on to our 
parade, we stood at " open order " as the general officers rode 
up. Never did the boys appear to better advantage ; and, as 
the parade was dismissed, mingling with the cheers of the men 
of the other regiments, could be heard the clapping of hands 
by the Generals and the officers accompanying them. 

And so ended the day, for most of us ; but not for me ! My 
explanation was jet to be made at headquarters. While wait 
ing for the pleasure of the General, I was a good deal amused 
at the comments upon the 34th, made by the different officers 
there assembled. 

" For my part," said a Field Officer, " I think the great 
strength of the 34th is in their Battalion drills ! Not only the 
officers, but each man seems to know the detail of every move- 



SIGEL S CAMPAIGN. 271 

ment! and even to anticipate orders before they are given." 
" Yes," said another, u their Battalion drills are splendid ; but, 
after all, their particular strong point is their skirmish drill ; 
there s nothing like it I You have n t seen it? well, you ought 
to ! from beginning to end not a word is spoken; but the whole 
line moves like machinery, at the mere call from their bugles. 
It s perfectly splendid! We ll ask the Colonel to take them 
out to-morrow." " After all," broke in another, a Staff Officer, 
" after all, admirable and excellent as the regiment is in its 
drill, it is on parade that it most excels. Nothing I have ever 
seen approaches it there ! To-night, for instance, could ever 
anything be more perfect? " 

I was now called to the presence of the General, who sat 
surrounded by his immediate military family. Saluting, I 
commenced my explanation. " No matter ! no matter about 
that, Colonel," he broke in, u it s all right; you have got a 
splendid regiment, admirably drilled, and I only wish I had 
others half as good ! " and so that matter ended. 

Sth. The weather to-day is excessively hot, and the men 
suffer much. 

An order from Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, is just received, dis 
missing from his command, Field, late of our G, who was 
discharged from the 34th some time since, to enable him to 
accept a commission in the " Corps d Afrique." The order 
directs that his discharge from the 34th be cancelled, and 
lie be returned to duty with us in the ranks. Field, who 
has reported himself, has been informed that our claim upon 
him ceased, upon his being mustered out of the service as a 
private in our ranks ; and that, as far as we are concerned, he 
is free to go where, and as, he likes ; unless he would like to 
re-enlist. 

Deserters come in daily. They represent that there is no 
considerable force in the valley ; everything having been sent 
to strengthen Lee. 

Orders are out for our movement from here at 6 A. M. 
to-morrow. Our transportation is cut down to three army 
wagons, and, in consequence, everything not absolutely indis- 
pensible is sent back to Martinsburg. 



272 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

10th. Yesterday, after we had literally stripped ourselves 
in consequence of the order reducing our transportation, and 
when they could be of no possible use to us, the teams taken 
from us a few days since were returned ; but not as they went. 
We have managed, up to the present time, to retain horses 
with our wagons. Now, instead of them, we are furnished with 
mules. It s hard to tell whether these animals cause the most 
laughing or swearing. Our teamsters, sitting upon their boxes 
and drawing the reins over four good looking, well behaved 
horses, have worn a lordly air, as, cracking their long whips, 
and giving their leaders a gentle flick of the lash, they have 
rolled into camp at a rattling gait. You would not recognize 
them now as the same fellows, to see them astride the near 
wheeler, yipping, and yahing, and jerking the one line, in their 
attempts to get their teams somewhere near where they are 
wanted. Perhaps the shouts and halloos of the young devils, 
who, seeing their trouble in managing the teams, skirmish 
around the leading mules, first on one side, and then on the 
other, don t help the matter any. Be that as it may, nothing 
can deprive us of the fun we ve already had from the change.

Strasburg, May ~L()th. At 6 A. M. yesterday, the 84th having 
the advance, the column moved out on to the pike, and at about 
1 P.M. went into camp on the bank of " Cedar Creek," about two 
miles short of this village. The weather was oppressively hoi, 
the road dry and dusty; Avater seldom met with; and take it 
all in all, the march illy conducted. Two of our men fell by 
the way from sunstroke. We drove with us our fresh meat ; 
our hard tack is carried ; and although we have in our train more 
than two hundred empty wagons, not an ounce of pork is trans 
ported. Meat from cattle driven during the day, killed at 
night, and eaten, at the farthest, the next morning, has already 
produced its inevitable results diarrhoea. 

We remain in camp to-day that the engineer company may 
rebuild the bridge over the creek, which was destroyed when 
Banks and Jackson were having their little trial of speed 
over this race ground. 

Regimental General Orders appoint Lieut. A. C. Walker to 
be acting Adjutant, and assign Lieut. Woods, now serving as 
A. A. A. G. 011 the staff of Max Webber, at the Ferry, to the 
line, in Company H. 

General Orders u Army Headquarters " direct battalion drill 
in every command, for this afternoon ; and General Orders 
"Headquarters Infantry Division" prohibit "the beating of

drums in camp or on the march ; " and " Special Orders " same 
Headquarters, direct " that in future " reveille and tattoo calls 
Ci shall be sounded by bugles ; and only by the buglers of the 
34th Massachusetts Infantry Volunteers. 

Lieut. Macomber, with his Engineer Corps, has been busy all 
day tearing down a large barn, for material for his bridge ; and 
a detail of three hundred axemen are now employed in cutting 
timber to be used for the same purpose. 

Woodstock, May 12th. We broke camp yesterday, at 6 A. M., 
and moved on to the Pike, where we were doomed to stand till 
past 10 o clock, that the rest of the column might precede us ; 
we being assigned the duty of bringing up the rear. Notwith 
standing the large detail ordered to the assistance of the Engi 
neer Corps, the bridge was incomplete, and the stream was 
forded. 

Soon after leaving Strasburg, a halt was ordered, that our 
supply train, with its accompanying drove of cattle, might come 
up and pass to the front. The strife between our drovers and 
the women and children by the wayside, the one to kt gobble," 
the others to rescue from the draft, now a single cow, and now 
one or more head of young stock, was amusing enough. One 
ragged, dirty, gaunt, grizzly, bare-legged old woman afforded us 
(not in authority) special amusement, as she persistently fol 
lowed, now pouring loud lamentations over her loss, into the 
ears of every officer she could approach ; and now, diving past 
guards, in the hope of separating from the drove, her " one 
pet lamb "- a scrawny old bull. The poverty of the animal 
plead more in her behalf than her tears or lamentations ; and 
after a while her old bull was separated from the drove and 
turned back. 

About a mile beyond Strasburg our advance disturbed a 
party of about twenty-five Rebels, engaged in undermining, for 
the purpose of blowing up, the stone bridge spanning " Tumb 
ling Creek." No other effect was produced than to cause a 
halt, while the overhanging crest could be scouted. Rain fell 
in torrents, from this time till we went into camp. Occasional 
shots were fired into the column by skulking bushwhackers on 
the roadside, but without injury to any in the command. 



SIG-EL S CAMPAIGN. 275 

We are now being stripped again, for the work, whatever it 
may be, which is before us. 

All Sutlers are ordered back, save one for each Brigade, to be 
designated by the A. B. G. thereof. -In our case, the Sutler of 
the 1st West Virginia, a one legged man, with a two horse 
team, has been selected to accompany the column. 

The rain still continues, but spite of it, and our contracted 
accommodations, we make ourselves comfortable. 

We are encamped in a most lovely spot; and the view from 
our own Headquarters is beautiful, indeed. The Red bud, or 
Judas tree, with its mantle of flaming scarlet, contrasts with 
the clear white of the flowering Dogwood, upon the rich green 
background of oak and hickory foliage. At our feet are parked 
the wagons of our train ; beyond, the horses of the Cavalry are 
revelling in a field of rye, now in full head ; to the right, the 
beeves, upon which we are to subsist, are lazily chewing their 
cud of contentment, while every knoll and hillside is thickly 
dotted with the shelter tents of the men. The air resounds 
with the lowing of cattle, the neighing of horses, and the bray 
ing of mules. From afar, comes the shrill trumpet call : while 
from our own encampment the mellow bugle note falls upon 
the ear. Occasionally the hearty laugh of some light hearted 
"boy" is heard. Strange ! not a bird is seen! nor has the note 
of one been heard ! 

12th. We still hold our position, and furnish guards for the 
posts to the rear. 

A queer story is current this morning, in explanation of the 
dull, heavy rumble of moving wagons, which, first heard in the 
evening, was continued far into the night. It was understood 
yesterday that a " train was to be sent down the valley ; " and 
in the afternoon, many teams were to to be seen winding along 
the different encampments, and drawing up, in long line, upon 
the Pike. By evening the head of this train had passed the 
guards immediately about the camp. The officer in charge of 
the post in our rear arrested the further progress of the train, 
and sent in to us for instructions. As he reported the train to 
be in charge of the Division Wagon Master, he was instructed 
to offer no obstruction to its further progress ; and slowly it 



276 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

passed from sight. Soon the Chief Quartermaster, who had 
been accidentally delayed at Army Headquarters, rode up to 
the post and inquired for the train. Informed that it had passed 
on its way down the Pike, he dashed in pursuit, overtook, and 
caused its return to camp. It was en route, without any escort. 
Inquiring now into the circumstances of its setting forth, he 
learned that a note, to a casual observer, in his own hand-writ 
ing, directing the train to be put in motion, and stating that he, 
with an escort, would soon overtake it, had been delivered to 
the Wagon Master in charge, by a horseman wearing the Union 
blue. A neat little trick ! which, but for its timely discovery, 
inasmuch as Mosby and McNeil and others are below us, would 
have cost us largely in animals and wagons ; and would have 
given to the Rebels an amount of transportation which they are 
sadly in need of. 

14th. The odor of roast veal greeted our nostrils in the 
early air of the morning ; and the sight of three of our drummer 
boys, as they stood ranged in front of Regimental Headquarters, 
told us plainly the source of this addition to our mess table. 
Rather hard upon them ! after a night s successful catering, to 
stand, and see others devour the fruits of their chase ! 

At Guard mounting, three Go s, Capt. Fox commanding, 
were detailed to seize, and bring into camp, some bacon and 
flour, discovered by a scouting party, concealed in a mill a few 
miles back from our encampment. 

The quiet, which settled down upon us at their departure, 
was unexpectedly, at about 11 A. M., broken by the sounding of 
" the assembly," from our Bugles. There was arming in hot haste 
as the voice of the Col. was heard, ordering the Companies on 
to the parade, at double-quick. There was no waiting for 
ceremony. The line was hardly formed, when the order "right 
face" was given ; and riling on to the pike, and turning to the 
left, we headed up the Valley. Through the encampment ; past 
the remaining Infantry, and Artillery ; along the nearly deserted 
streets of Woodstock; -beyond the advanced pickets; out into 
the enemy s country, we marched. On, still on ; officers and 
men alike speculating as to the object of the movement our 
Col., grim and taciturn as death I Now the sun burned with 



SIGEL S CAMPAIGN. 277 

intense heat; now the clouds poured their contents like a 
deluge. Heated by the rapidity of the march in the close, 
muggy air, without water in their canteens, the Boys began to 
falter. But, deaf to all expostulations, our Col. cries out, "for 
ward." On, still on; with no abatement in speed; no halt 
for rest, or to recover breath. For the first time our men fall 
out; and some of our officers falter, but no halt is ordered! 
Still forward ; past our friends of the 12th W. Va., who, drawn 
up by the wayside, salute, and afterwards, give us a ringing 
cheer as we move by. The air is oppressively hot and close ; 
the men are faint ; and the ranks are getting thinned. Officers 
beg for water, their pride alone keeping them from falling out: 
but there is no sign of halting. " Mount Jackson " comes into 
sight; is reached; is passed; still our leader cries only 
"forward!" Still on ; beyond support; past hope of help, if 
help should be needed. Now, one Union soldier is seen, hurry 
ing to our little column ; soon another, soon more ; some 
dismounted, others upon horses blown, and covered with sweat. 
All, as they catch sight of our flag, hasten to its protection. 
What does it all mean ? These men are of Boyd s (1st) New 
York Cavalry ; our gallant companions in last winter s expe 
dition, over this same route. Now Boyd himself appears ; on 
foot heated and giving evidence of having had a u lively 
time." We are halted, that he may tell his story. He had 
been ordered, on the Wednesday previous, to make a detour 
through the " Luray Valley," and come into camp, on this day, 
(Saturday), at New Market. He had accomplished the first 
part of his order ; and, attempting the latter part, saw, as he 
was descending the mountain s pass, spread out in the Valley 
at his feet, an encampment, which, from his orders to come into 
camp, at this place, (New Market), on this day, he took to be 
of our own force. Undeceived, he pressed forward. The 
enemy had, however, discovered him, and sent a force through 
the woods ; which, passing his flanks, reached his rear, and 
barricaded the pass behind him. As he debouched from the 
gap, an overwhelming force was hurled against him. To 
advance was impossible, so great was the odds ; to fight was 
madness: Safety laid only in retreat. But the barricades in 
21 



278 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

his rear rendered this impracticable ; and each trooper, left to 
his own resources, sought safety in the woods and under-brush 
of the side hills. What now were we to do ? We had been 
hurried forward, under orders to " report to Col. Moore of the 
28th Ohio Volunteer Infantry." We had heard nothing of or 
from him since we left our encampment. Boyd knew nothing 
of him. All our inquiries were futile. No one had seen, or if 
they had, would they acknowledge to have seen, any Union 
troops, other than our own little body. We were beyond 
support. While the men were resting, the staff rode out to 
reconnoitre ; but nothing came of it. We could hear nothing 
of Col. Moore ; and, obedient to our orders, resumed our 
march. The bridge, which spanned the north fork of the She- 
nandoah, was crossed. So reckless seemed the movement, that 
it was almost as if we left hope behind. As we rose the crest 
of " Rhude s Hill," the boom of distant Artillery was heard. 
Eyes brightened, and steps were quickened. A shriek over 
head, and a dull thud, was heard, as a shell dropped along 
side the column, but doing no greater injury than splashing 
with mud some of the men of "I" and "B." A side step to 
the right, took us out of direct range. And while officers rode 
out to reconnoitre, the men rested upon their arms. A spiteful 
crack was now heard on our left, from which direction, Acting 
Adjutant A. C. Walker, was seen galloping towards us. He 
had come upon one section of Artillery, belonging to the Union 
army, posted upon rising ground to the left of the pike, but 
without support. We moved to its aid, and the men were 
allowed to rest, partially sheltered, in open timber to its rear. 

A sharp, but short artillery duel now followed ; the enemy s 
shot going over our heads, and striking far in our rear ; while 
the shells from our pieces could be plainly seen to explode over 
the Rebel Battery. From the increasing darkness or other 
causes, the enemy s fire soon ceased ; and, after some delay, the 
34th was moved forward upon the hill where the enemy s guns 
had been posted. Advancing by regimental front, we entered 
the woods, and were halted. "A" and " G," Captains Willard 
and Leach, were thrown forward to picket our front, and upon 
the establishment of their line, the men were ordered to lie 



SIGEL S CAMPAIGN. 279 

down upon their arms. No fires were allowed ; the lighting of 
pipes, even, was prohibited ; and, without supper, the command 
prepared to bivouac in the rain and mud, as, without dinner, it 
had made the march, in the rain and heat of the day. Nothing, 
save the rain, as it pattered upon the leaves, broke the profound 
silence. Such few orders as it was necessary to issue were given 
in whispers. Time it seemed, in the anxiety and suspense, 
as if hours passed. With no previous warning, a single shot 
was heard, a few scattering ones followed, and then a deafening 
volley broke the almost death-like stillness. With the first 
report the men sprung up, as they had laid down, in line. A 
whispered " what is it?" was heard in the ranks. Messengers 
who were quickly sent out, returned, reporting that our picket 
line was undisturbed save by this fire in their rear. But, 
beyond this, nothing could be learned ; and, after an interval of 
weary waiting, the men were allowed to lie down again. But 
not long did they remain undisturbed. As before, the single 
discharge, then scattering shots were heard, quickly followed by 
repeated vollies, this time the balls cutting small branches from 
the trees under which we were again standing. Who and what 
is it? was again whispered among us. An officer who had gone 
far to our left, in which direction the firing was heard, soon 
returned, bringing information that Col. Moore, to whom we 
had been ordered to report, and whom we had been vainly seek 
ing all the day previous, in endeavoring to establish his picket 
line, on ground to our left, had, in the darkness, stumbled upon 
the Rebels, similarly engaged ; and the fire was from the forces 
thus unexpectedly brought together. From this time on, the 
night passed quietly. Before dawn the command was roused, 
and stood to their arms; and about daybreak Capt. Fox reached 
us, with his foraging party, having marched all night to come 
up with us. 



CHAPTER XXVIII. 



SIGEL S CAMPAIGN BATTLE OF NEW MARKET. 

Our arms were now stacked, rations issued, and preparation 
made for cooking breakfast. It was not eaten, however, before 
Col. Moore, in person, rode up and directed us to retire some 
two miles, and there form in line of battle. This route led us 
through fields of young wheat, the soft, sticky mud of which, 
nearly ankle deep, rendered the movement exceedingly fatiguing. 
Some of our boys lost their shoes in this mud, and thereafter 
fought and retreated in stockinged feet. 

Our line was hardly formed in compliance with this order, 
when an A. D. C. brought directions that we should resume 
our former ground. When this was reached, Companies U B " 
and "I," Capt. Potter, commanding, were detached and sent as 
skirmishers to cover our front; and the remaining Companies 
were ordered to form across a neighboring ravine. While the 
regiment was occupied in this movement, the order was 
countermanded, and the Colonel was directed to re-occupy, 
with his entire command, the ground upon which we had 
formed our first line of battle. Capt. Potter was re-called from 
the skirmish line, where, ably seconded by Capt. Soley, he had 
so skilfully distributed and so admirably handled his small 
party, as to have checked the advance of the Rebel force, many 
times his superior. He overtook us on our retrograde move 
ment and the regiment thus united, soon after formed in 
column of companies, on the right of the pike, about midway 
from Rhude s Hill to New Market. We were soon, however, 
deployed into line, to the right. At this point the pike runs 
nearly in a south-easterly direction. On its right, up to and 
beyond the Village of New Market, the country was much 
broken. High hills, heayily timbered, rise on the west of the 



SIGEL S CAMPAIGN. 281 

village, which are intersected by deep and somewhat rocky 
ravines, running at right angles with the highway. On the left 
of the pike the ground, though rolling and somewhat broken, 
was comparatively easy. 

In the early morning Col. Moore had " formed his command 
" along a high hill on the west side of the town, and checked 
" for a while the enemy s advance." " But Maj. Gen. Stahl rode 
up and assumed command." Sigel, also, arrived soon after. 
Moore now, in obedience to orders, fell back some eight hun 
dred yards, to the rear of the position he had himself taken, and 
formed "the 123d Ohio and 18th Connecticut on the left of a 
cottage;" the "other two Regiments," 1st West Virginia and 
84th Massachusetts, being detached and sent to "join their own 
Brigade, way in the rear." Thus weakened, but having a small 
supporting force of Cavalry, Moore held what may be called 
our first line ; against which, Moore reports, " the Rebels 
"advanced, heralding their approach by their peculiar yells, 
" coming up in two strong lines, far overlapping my own ; my 
" skirmishers were driven in, and after a short, but resolute 
" struggle, this line was forced to the rear, which created some 
" confusion in the 18th Connecticut, owing to knee deep mud, 
"out-houses and stables close to their rear, and the insufficient. 
" number of officers to control their movements." Meanwhile 
the troops composing the 2d Brigade, which in reality formed 
our only line of battle, were placed in position, under the imme 
diate direction of Gen. Sigel himself. " On the extreme right 
" were two Batteries (Snow s and Carlin s), close to the woods 
" reaching down to the river. Von Kleyser s on an eminence in 
" the centre, a little advanced ; and Ewing s 011 a ridge, on our 
" extreme left ; the Cavalry behind our right and left centre. 
"The 34th Massachusetts was formed first into line, its right 
" resting near the two batteries mentioned ; then the 1st Vir- 
" ginia and 54th Pennsylvania. The 12th West Virginia Avas 
" ordered to form in double column, behind the right, and took 
" its position in rear of the 34th Regiment, as a reserve. One 
" Company of the 34th (C., Capt. Chauncey), was ordered to 
" cover our right flank, in the woods, towards the river ; and 
" four or five companies of the 12th Virginia, mentioned above, 



282 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" to protect the two batteries on the right." This line stretched 
along a ravine extending toward the pike, and was partially 
covered from the enemy by a hill, which, rising gradually, 
extended some distance in its front. While it was awaiting the 
advance of the enemy, the men of Moore s line carne back u on 
" the double quick, some of them running through and over our 
"lines, nor stopped till they met and joined the 28th and 116th 
" Ohio, which two Regiments, under charge of Col. Washburn, 
" were left in charge of the train, and had been halted at Mount 
" Jackson, by some Staff officer/ 

The advance of the Rebels, before which Moore s line had 
given way, was steady and continued. The air was filled with 
bullets and bursting shells ; but, as yet, we had sustained no 
harm. Colonel Wells took his position at the left, sending 
Lieut. Colonel Lincoln up to the right of the Regiment 
Now Company G, Capt. Leach, was detached, and sent 
forward as skirmishers to cover our front. " It went forward, 
deploying about 200 yards in advance, with a precision and 
steadiness never surpassed on drill ; " but, upon reaching the 
crest of the hill, was recalled, and, passing through our lines, 
formed in rear of their proper place in regimental line. Spent 
bullets were falling thickly among and around us, but inflicting 
no injury. Now, from some unexplained cause, the 12th Vir 
ginia opened fire, over the heads of our men, causing the first 
casualties of the day ; and it was only by the most active efforts 
of Gen. Sigel, and our own Lieutenant Colonel, who rode 
among their lines to aid their own officers, that the seeming 
demoralization of this command was checked, and order restored. 
A charge of the whole line was now ordered. Our men sprang 
forward with a cheer. Our dogs, of whom we had a small 
army, ran frolicking and barking before us, as they had so often 
done, on drill. Receiving the fire of both lines, they were nearly 
all killed. Here, at the very front of our advance, fell Lieut. 
R. W. Walker, of A, as was then supposed, mortally wounded. 
W^e poured a rapid and well directed fire into the enemy ; which, 
aided by the heavy enfilading fire from our artillery, checked 
his advance. For a moment he staggered, appeared to give 
way, and the day seemed ours. The rain was falling in tor 
rents ; and this, with the smoke, which settled down thick upon 



SIGEL S CAMPAIGN. 283 

us, hid the field from observation. Gallant as was our own 
charge, the order had met with a feeble response on our left, 
where the troops, turning, went back, suffering little loss, and 
inflicting less upon the enemy. While Breckenridge was 
moving his main force against our front, Imboden galloped 
down on our left, and opened his artillery within point blank 
range. Exposed to this flank fire, the 54th Pennsylvania, after 
a short but stout insistence, was led from the field by its brave 
commander, upon his own responsibility. 

An order to retreat came up to us from the left. We fell back 
slowly, and in good order ; the men, as well as the officers cry 
ing out, " Steady ! Keep your line ! Do n t run, 84th ! " It 
was impossible to see to any considerable distance, so thick was 
the smoke and rain. Suddenly, Bacon s voice was heard, calling 
upon his men to stand by the colors ; and in response to what 
was supposed to be a general movement of the line, the right 
companies were halted, faced about, and became again warmly 
engaged. A determined charge upon our front, and a withering 
fire poured into our left flank, and rear, from the now contract 
ing lines of the Rebels, was too much. The Color Company 
turned ; its gallant Captain received his death wound, and the 
companies of the right wing followed their comrades of the left, 
in retreat. Just at this moment our Lieutenant Colonel fell, 
severely hit by shot, and shell, and, unable to continue in retreat, 
was left in the hands of the enemy. Our troops kept on in 
slow and sullen retreat till they reached Rhude s Hill, some 
five miles from where the battle began. Here, meeting the 
troops which had not be.en engaged, and the cavalry which had 
not suffered in the battle, they were rallied. The vigor of 
Breckenridge s pursuit abated, and Sigel withdrew his force, 
crossing the Shenandoah, and burning the bridge behind him. 

Col. Wells, of the 34th, tells the story with more minuteness, 
in the following official communication to His Excellency, Gov. 
Andrew : 

HEADQUARTERS ADVANCE FORCES IN FRONT OF STRASBURG, 

May 21st, 1864. 

Saturday we broke camp, in the rear of Woodstock, and marched to New Market, a 
distance of twenty-one miles, in seven hours, and with but ten minutes halt. Our 
force consisted of a small amount of cavalry, artillery, and infantry, under Col. Moore. 
\Ve had a small artillery fight at New Market ; and after dark, laid down in the 



284 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 



woods occupied by the enemy. After some skirmishing, the enemy evacuated, and, 
hy morning, had withdrawn entirely from our front. By nine o clock, however, they 
began an advance in force. 

Three Companies of the 34th. under Capt. Potter, were sent far forward, upon a 
commanding hill; and, by skilful deployment, led the enemy to believe our whole 
force was there. He massed heavy columns on the right ; and with three lines of 
battle, and with much yelling, advanced upon the line, only to find it empty. This 
manoeuvring gave us two or three hours time, in which Gen. Sigel, with a part of 
the remainder of the army, arrived on the field. After considerable manoeuvring, our 
line was formed, about where it was the night before the Artillery on the right, on 
rising ground, resting on the river; the 34th in line, its right on the Battery, its left 
touching the pike; other regiments on our left, and one in column in our rear. In 
front was rolling ground, on the other slope of which were two regiments of Infantry, 
with Infantry and Cavalry skirmishers. The Rebels advanced in three lines of battle ; 
each, I think, as heavy as ours, with masses on the right and left. The ground was 
perfectly ppen, not a tree or shrub to obstruct the view. Nothing could be finer than 
their advance. Their yelling grew steadily nearer, and skirmishers, our Infantry in 
front, came back on the double quick, some of them running through and over my 
lines ! 

The air was filled with bullets and bursting shells, and my men began to fall. I was 
ordered to deploy one company, across my front, as skirmishers; and Capt. Leach, 
with Company "G," went forward ; and his groups halted and deployed in the 
tumult, about two hundred yards in advance ; each man taking his exact interval, 
and deploying to the right, as steadily as on drill. The officers, in the line, were 
giving their orders in low tones ; and every man stood, his gun at the ready, his finger 
on the trigger, waiting to see the face of his foe. It was a marvel to me then, and is 
now, how men, who almost never before had heard the Rebel" yell, and the terrible 
din of the battle field, could be so entirely calm and self-possessed. Soon, our men in 
front were, by the confusion, cleared away, the Rebel lines were plainly seen, and the 
battle began. Our front fire was heavy ; and the Artillery had an enfilading fire, 
under which their first line went down. They staggered, went back, arid their whole 
advance halted. Their fire ceased to be effective. A cheer run along our line, and the 
first success was ours. I gave the order to "cease firing." Just then, Col. Thoburn, 
Brigade Commander, rode along the lines, telling the men to "prepare to charge." 
He rode by me, shouting some order I could not catch, and went to the regiment on 
my left, which immediately charged. I supposed this to be his order to me, and 
commanded to fix bayonets, and charge. The men fairly sprang forward. As we 
neared the crest of the hill, the regiment on my left, which first met the fire, turned 
and went back, leaving the 34th rushing alone into the enemy s line. I shouted to 
them to halt, but could not make a single man hear or heed me; and it was not until 
they had climbed an intervening fence, and were rushing ahead on the other side, that 
I was able to run along the lines, and, seizing the color bearer by the shoulder, hold 
him fast, as the only way of stopping the regiment. The wings surged ahead, but, 
losing sight of the colors, halted. The alignment rectified, we faced about, and 
marched back to our position, in common time. I could hear the officers saying to the 
men, and the men to each other, "Don t run! " " Keep your line! " "Common 
time!" &c. On reaching our position, the regiment was halted, faced about, and 
resumed its fire. The path of the regiment, between our line and the fence, was sadly 
strewn with our fallen. Just as we halted, Lieut. Col. Lincoln fell. The loss of his 
invaluable services, and the impossibility of making my voice heard in the din, 
rendered it necessary for me to go along the whole line, to make the men understand 
what was wanted. The alignment perfected, and the men well at work, I was able 
to look about the field, and saw, to my surprise, that the Artillery had limbered up, 



SIGEL S CAMPAIGN. 285 

and was moving off the field ; and that the Infantry had gone, save one regiment, 
which was gallantly holding the ground, far to the left. The Rebel line advanced, 
until I could see, above the smoke, the battle flags on the hill where the artillery had 
been posted. I ordered a retreat, but they either could not hear or would not heed 
the order. I was finally obliged to take hold of the rolor bearer, face him about, and 
tell him to follow me, in order to get the regiment off the field. They fell back slowly, 
firing in retreat, and encouraging each other not to run. 

But the Rebels were coming on at the double quick, and concentrating their whole 
fire upon us. I told the men to run, and get out of fire as quickly as possible, and 
rally behind the first cavalry line found to the rear. The colors were halted several 
times, by different officers, in positions where it was impossible to make a stand, and 
would only start again at my direct order. I felt much relieved on receiving an order 
from Gen. Sullivan, who was conspicuous on the field, that the line would be formed 
on the ridge, and no stand made before it was reached. I directed the color bearer to 
inarch directly there, without halting; and, after getting out of fire, rode to the rear, 
and went round into the pike, and towards the front, looking for stragglers. I saw 
none; and, meeting the colors, found most of the regiment with them. The new line 
was formed under the personal supervision of Gens. Sigel, Stahl, and Sullivan. The 
pursuit of the enemy was checked ; and the command was gallantly withdrawn along 
the single road, and across the narrow bridge, into Mount Jackson, in most admirable 
order, and without a single casualty. That night we stood in line until about nine 
o clock, marching, behind the wagon train, till six o clock the next morning, and 
reached Strasburg about 5 P. M. of Monday, having been fifty-five hours almost 
continuously marching, or under arms, in a constant and pouring storm. The march 
in that time was fifty-two miles. I can only say for the regiment, that the coolness 
and gallantry of the officers filled me with admiration; and I cannot recall, without 
deep emotion, the cheerful endurance by the men of the extraordinary hardships of 
the march, and the spontaneous and hearty devotion with which they offered their 
lives to the country. The same willing and cheerful obedience which has always 
characterized them in camp, distinguished them in the field; while they added to it a 
fire and heroism which cannot be excelled. I cannot particularize, where all did so 
well. Conspicuous, only, perhaps, from their more exposed position, were Color 
Sergeant John E. Calligau; Corporal Pepper, bearer of the State flag, hit four times, 
and struck to the ground; Corporal Wishart, who took the colors from his hands, and 
bore them the remainder of the day; and Capt. Bacon, of the Color Company, who fell 
directly behind his colors, while keeping his ranks steady as on parade. 

I am under deep obligations to Lieut. Col. Lincoln and Adjt. A. C. Walker for their 
efficient services and great gallantry on the field. 

As many of the officers were on detached service, I subjoin a list of those on the 
field: 

Col. George D. Wells; Lieut.-Col. Lincoln, (wounded and a prisoner); Surgeon 
R. R. Clarke; Adjt. A. C. Walker; Assistant Surgeon Smith; Assistant Surgeon 
Allen (left in care of wounded at Mount Jackson); Capts. Potter, Thompson, Fox 
(killed), wounded and a prisoner ; Soley, Willard (wounded), Bacon (killed), Leach, 
Lovell, Chauncey (prisoner), ; 1st Lieuts. Goodrich (wounded), Elwell, Ripley; 2d 
Lieuts. R. W. Walker, (killed), loounded and a prisoner; Ammidon (captured), 
Dempsey, M. E. Walker, Belser, Murdock (wounded), Kinnicutt (wounded); and 
Major Pratt, on Gen. Stahl s staff; Lieut. Bacon, on Col. Thoburri s staff; and Lieut. 
Macomber, in Division Pioneer Corps. Company C was sent off to skirmish on the 
right of the line, and lost half its numbers prisoners, together with its two officers. I 
believe these are the only men left un wounded in the enemy s hands. The detaching 
of this Company, with other details, left me about four hundred and fifty muskets in 
99 



286 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 



line. Of these, the casualties foot up over two hundred killed and wounded. Five 
out of every six who went in have the marks of bullets somewhere. Dr. Clarke has 
sent Dr. Dale a list of casualties, as near as can be ascertained. Our wounded, left 
behind, are very comfortable, and well treated. 

I have to regret the loss of some of the most noble and gallant spirits of my 
command. Gen. Sigel was on his horse, on the right of our line, during most of the 
engagement, and in the hottest of the fire. How he escaped is a mystery to me. He 
has done the regiment the honor to compliment it in very high terms. 

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, 

Your obedient servant, 

GEO. D. WELLS. 

Col. 34:th Mass. Infantry. 
Hon. JOHN A. ANDREW, Governor of Massachusetts. 

I add to this the following extracts from the Rebel General 
Imboden s official report of the engagement, as not without 
interest : 

" Breckenridge now resolved to attack, and disposed his troops accordingly, placing 
the brigades of Echols and W barton in the centre of his line, on the west of the turn 
pike, while McLaughlin, with the bulk of the artillery, occupied the highest ground 
of the bold ridge that runs parallel with the turnpike, and giving Imboden permission 
to go ahead as he deemed best, on the east of the pike. Accordingly, Imboden moved 
at a gallop, with a part of his force, to Smith s creek, down which he kept to the 
bridge on the Luray" road, where he re-crossed to the west side, with two guns, and 
all his troops, except the 13th Regiment, which he sent down on the east side, as if 
aiming at Sigel s rear. The two guns were run up within point blank range of Sigel s 
left cavalry flank, and opened on him. Simultaneously, Breckenridge pressed 
forward. Sigel s entire line retired slowly. His artillery was especially damaging, 
and he (Breckenridge) determined to silence at least one, and the most mischievous, 
battery, directly in front of the centre of his line; and Col. Smith, of the 62d \ r irginia, 
and Col. Skip, with his Cadets, were ordered to charge and take it. When the 
charge commenced, the ardor of the Cadets took them across the ravine, a little in 
advance of the old veteran regiment. As soon as Col. Skip saw this, though then 
under cannister fire, he ordered his corps of boys to " halt," and " mark time; "which 
they did, till Smith came up; when the two Colonels gave the order to charge, and the 
battery was taken, but with fearful loss on both sides. The gunners stood by their 
pieces till bayoneted, and the 34th Massachusetts, under Lieut. Col. Lincoln, 
supporting the guns, fought hand to hand, till their gallant commander fell, as was 
supposed, mortally wounded ; though he subsequently recovered whilst a prisoner. 

"After the capture of these guns, Sigel commenced a slow and sullen retreat, 
reaching Rhude s hill, nearly five miles from where the battle commenced in the 
morning, late in the afternoon, and there offered a stubborn resistance. 

" Breckenridge s infantry had nearly exhausted their ammunition, and he ordered the 
entire line to halt for nearly an hour, to enable the men to fill their cartridge boxes 
from the ordnance train, which was brought on to the field for that purpose. Mean 
while the artillery kept up a vigorous fire. Night was drawing on apace ; and when 
Breckenridge was prepared to advance again, Sigel suddenly disappeared from Rhude s 
hill, and by the time the Confederates gained its summit, the rear of Sigel s army was

crossing the bridge over the Shenandoah, at Mount Jackson, which he immediately 
fired and destroyed, thus baffling further pursuit. 

"The victory of the Confederates was complete. Over fifteen hundred dead and 
wounded, with as many stands of arms, fell into their hands, together with six pieces 
of artillery. Their loss in killed and wounded was also heavy. The 62d liegiment 
alone, of Imboden s command, reported two hundred and forty-one killed and 
wounded, including seven of the ten Captains, three of whom were killed in the 
charge on the captured battery. The corps of Cadets lost eight, killed and four 
officers and forty-seven privates, wounded, out of a total force of two hundred and fifty 
engaged. Gen. Echols casualties were nearly three hundred, including the Cadets, 
mostly wounded. The artillery did not lose over eight or ten, killed and wounded. 
Except the 62d Regiment, attached to Wharton s brigade, the casualties were small. 
And such was the case with the Cavalry. Six hundred would probably embrace all 
casualties; of which, less than one hundred were fatal. The losses sustained by Sigel 
were nearly three times as great, including killed, wounded, and captured, and arose 
chiefly from the larger force he had engaged." 

The folloAving figures from official sources will show how 
erroneous were Imboden s conclusions as to the strength of the 
opposing armies, and the comparative loss sustained. 

The official reports made to Gen. Breekenridge, on the 
morning of the 16th of May, show the aggregate then present 
to be : 

In Wharton s brigade, Infantry, . . . . 1309 

" Echols " . 1488 

" North West, " 983 

" Battalion Cadets, " . 221 

" Engineer Corps, . 4(&gt; 

" McLaughlin s Artillery, . 235 

Total, Infantry and Artillery, 4282 

Imboden, in his report, gives the total as : Infantry, 3440 ; 
Cavalry, 800; and, Artillery, 350, with 18 gnus; total, 4590. 

"Of this number it appears there were killed, 34; wounded, 484; missing, 13. 
Total, 531." " No casualty in the Cavalry." 

A field report of a special inspection of the Infantry of Sigel s 
army, made at Martinsburg, April 25, 1864, and the latest at 
my command, gives as then present : 

In Thoburn s Brigade Officers, . . 77 Rank and File . . 1746 
" Moore s " " . 41 " " " . 1625 

Total, . . 128 ... 3371 

Or, in all, 3499. Deduct from this the 28th and 116th Ohio, 
which two regiments were not even on the battle field, 740 ; 



288 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

and the 18th Connecticut and 123d Ohio, 026, which, as Col. 
Moore reports, were literally " overrun at once by the over 
whelming force of the enemy," and which, according to Col. 
Wells, " came back on the double quick," some time before the 
Rebel line struck Thoburn s little brigade, and there remains 
but 1,833 as the strength of the Union infantry actually 
engaged. I have no means of ascertaining the strength of our 
artillery engaged. A field return, under date of the 19th of 
May, gives it as 548, with 19 guns. The strength of the cavalry 
is also unknown. Whatever it was, it contributed little or 
nothing to avert the disaster to our arms. According to the 
official returns, the total Union loss during the day was : 
killed, 93 ; wounded, 482 ; captured, 70 ; and missing, 186; total, 
831." Of this total, our own regiment sustained nearly one-third. 
Capt. William B. Bacon and 26 men died a "soldier s death" upon 
the field ; Lieut. Col. Lincoln, Capt. H. P. Fox and Lieut. R. 
W. Walker, with 32 men, were severely wounded and left in 
the hands of the enemy. Capt. C. R. Chauncey and Lieut. 
M. Ammidon, with 19 men, were cut off and taken prisoners. 
In addition, Col. Wells, Capt. Willard, Lieuts. Goodrich, Kinni- 
cutt and Murdock, with 134 men, were wounded, but were able 
to make their way from the field with the command. 

Writes Major Pratt, of the 34th, Acting Inspector General at 
the time, 011 the staff of Major General Stahl, second in 
command, and who, from his position, may well enough be 
believed to have had accurate information of the strength of 
our own army : 

" We were compelled to fight under most adverse circumstances, and were therefore 
defeated. During the entire fight we had but 1500 infantry engaged, as we were 
unable to bring up the column then on the road ; and this little force was attacked by 
at least 8000 of the enemy. Nor were these green troops, but veterans. T was a 
magnificent sight to witness the enemy as he came down from the heights, advancing 
in three* splendid lines. I now remember that in the afternoon, during the thickest 
of the fight, while listening to the thunder of the Artillery and the rattle of the 
musketry, I imagined you all at church, or quietly at home, little dreaming of the 
murderous scenes being enacted in this beautiful valley. It is said by old and 
experienced officers that the entire war has witnessed no severer contest. In the 1st 
Infantry Division, out of 1500 men, all there was engaged, 781 were either killed or 
wounded. Praise of the 31th is on the lips of all; and the regiment deserves it; for 



* Two, according to Imboden. 



STGEL S CAMPAIGN. 289 

all accounts agree that it fought with a splendid daring and a cool courage, rarely 
equalled. Yesterday, Maj. Gen. Sigel, who commanded in person during the battle, 
and witnessed their conduct all through the fight, in a public speech, made at a flag 
raising, said, speaking of the 34th and its commander, Col. Wells, that it was the 
best regiment and had the best regimental commander he had ever seen. I give his 
exact words. Capt. Bacon, who was killed, was only twenty-one years of age, I 
believe, yet he died like a hero. Standing by the colors, he refused to retreat when 
the order was given, and bravely died facing the foe. 

" Massachusetts never lost a better soldier, nor old Worcester a nobler son." 

It will be noticed that Major Pratt falls into the error that 
Col. Wells did, of reporting the Rebel advance as made in three 
distinct lines; Imboden asserting that there were only two. The 
probable explanation is, that the line of advance being diagonal 
to our own line of formation, throwing the approach into an 
apparent echelon movement, had a tendency to mislead. 

All accounts agree that the advance of the Rebels was in 
magnificent form. Imboden gives the 34th credit for gallant 
and persistent fighting, and Col. Wells compliments one regi 
ment, (the 54th Pennsylvania,) for gallant conduct. The artil 
lery was well served. How, then, came the disaster? First, 
Col. Moore, in his report, complains that, after being assigned to 
the command of the troops, on the 14th of May, he " asked for 
scouts or a reliable map of the Valley, as I [he] had no knowl 
edge of the place at all ; but nobody could furnish either." He 
also states, " that it was a great mistake, not to let him take the 
regiments of his own brigade," and complains that at the very 
commencement of the battle, his own force, vastly outnumbered 
by the enemy, was further weakened by " the 1st Virginia and 
34th Massachusetts being detached from his own command, and 
sent to the rear to hunt up their own brigade." Altogether, 
Moore s complaint seems to be well grounded. Second, The 
true cause of the disaster seems to be found in the bad judg 
ment which led to accepting the chances of a battlefield without 
any, or, at least, without sufficient preparation. 

Moore was stripped of one half of his original command, and 
left with two small Regiments, insufficiently officered, to meet 
the first shock of arms ; and the battle was fought, on our side, 
by one-half of our Army, already exhausted by the marching 
and counter-marching of the morning, while the other half were 
held, miles away, at the rear. True, Sigel supposed these 



290 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

troops were up and constituted his left wing, as he had 
ordered, and as had been reported to him. In fact, however, 
they \vere lying upon the ground, miles away, in charge of our 
train, by order of some Staff Officer. 

The summary removal of Gen. Sigel from command, before 
any official report of the day s doings had been made, leaves it 
uncertain upon whom the responsibility for this condition of 
affairs should rest. 

As will have been noticed in the report of Col. Wells, a last 
line of battle was formed at Rhude s I Jill; from which, after 
some delay, our exhausted troops were skilfully withdrawn, in 
good order, and without loss. 

Entering Mt. Jackson, the bridge over the Shenandoah, by 
which we crossed, was fired and destroyed; and further pursuit 
checked. Here a halt was ordered. The men ate their suppers 
while the injured were looked up, their wounds examined and 
dressed, and the slightly injured placed in ambulances for trans 
portation. Those more severely wounded were disposed of in 
the hospital buildings in Mt. Jackson, and left under charge of 
Asst. Surgeon Allen, of the 34th. These arrangements complet 
ed, at about 9 p. M., the column was again put in motion, the 
84th bringing up the rear. After a sad and tiresome all night s 
inarch, Edinboro was reached about 7 o clock the next morn 
ing. Here a two hours halt was given the men, in which to 
cook their coffee and take the rest which was much needed. 
Then, resuming the march, it was continued till about 5 P. M., 
when camp was made on the hills overlooking Strasburg. 
Early the next morning we were again in motion ; and having 
crossed Cedar Creek, rested on the ground on which we had 
encamped on our way up the Valley. 

l$th. Early this morning the 34th, Capt. Potter commanding, 
and the 12th West Virginia, Col. Curtis, with one section of 
Battery B, 5th U. S. A., and a squadron of Cavalry, the whole 
under command of Col. Wells, of the 34th, were marched back 
through Strasburg to Fisher s Hill, where we took up position ; 
the Rebel pickets retiring before our advance. Our stay here 
was short, as, on the next day, orders reached us directing the 
entire force to fall back to Strasburg. We moved without 



291 

delay, and took up the new position designated; the Battery 
occupying the old earthworks on the hill overlooking the town, 
and the Infantry pitching their tents about half way down the 
hill in the rear. Here a scant issue of clothing was made, the 
most needy, only, being supplied. Several deserters from the 
Rebel Army came in; and a few Guerillas were brought in 
during our stay in the place. 

Major Pratt, who had been serving on the staff of Gen. Stahl, 
and who now was relieved to return to his command, was 
welcomed most heartily. Adjt. Woods surprised and gladdened 
all hearts by his unexpected appearance. Hearing of our 
losses, he resigned his position 011 Max. Webber s staff, and 
hastened to join his comrades. Of course he was restored to 
his old place on the Regimental Staff. We were reinforced, 
also, by the arrival of the officers and men whom we left behind 
at Martinsburg upon our first advance.

22d. General orders of to-day announce that the command 
of this army is assumed by Maj. Gen. Hunter; vice Maj. Gen. 
Sigel, relieved. The iron hand of the new Commander is already 
felt, as his order, just issued, and which follows, shows : 

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT WEST VIRGINIA, . 
IN THE FIELD, NEAR CEDAR CREEK, 

May 22d, 1864. 
GENERAL ORDERS No. 29. 

" It is of the utmost importance that this army be placed in a 
situation for immediate efficiency. We are contending against 
an enemy who is in earnest, and, if we expect success, we, too, 
must be in earnest. We must be willing to make sacrifices, 
willing to suffer for a short time, that a glorious result may 
crown out efforts. 

"The country is expecting every man to do his duty; and 
this done, an ever kind Providence will certainly grant us a 
complete success. 

".1. Every tent will be immediately turned in, for transpor 
tation to Martinsburg; and all baggage not expressly allowed 
by this order, will be at once sent to the rear. There will be 
but one wagon allowed to each Regiment, and this will only be 
used to transport spare ammunition, camp kettles, tools and 



HUNTER S RAID. 293 

mess-pans. Every wagon will have eight picked horses or mules, 
two drivers, and tivo saddles. One wagon, and one ambulance 
will be allowed to Department Headquarters ; and the same 
to Division, and Brigade Headquarters. The other ambulances 
will be under the immediate orders of the Medical Director. 

" II. For the expedition on hand, the clothes each soldier 
has on his back, with one pair of extra shoes, and socks, are 
amply sufficient. Everything else, in the shape of clothing, will 
be packed to-day, and sent to the rear. Each knapsack will con 
tain one hundred rounds of ammunition, carefully packed ; four 
pounds of hard bread, to last eight days ; ten rations of coffee, 
sugar, and salt ; one pair of shoes and socks, and nothing else. 

" III. Brigade and all other Commanders will be held strictly 
responsible that their commands are supplied from the country. 
Cattle, sheep, and hogs, and, if necessary, horses and mules must 
be taken, and slaughtered. These supplies will be seized under 
the direction of officers duly authorized, and upon a system 
which will hereafter be regulated. No straggling or pillaging 
will be allowed. Brigade and other Commanders will be held 
responsible that there is no waste ; and that there is a proper 
and orderly division amongst their men, of the supplies taken 
for our use. 

U IV. Commanders will attend personally to the prompt 
execution of this order, so that we may move to-morrow morn 
ing. They will see that in passing through a country, in this 
way, depending upon it for forage and supplies, great additional 
vigilance is required, on the part of every officer in the command 
of men, for the enforcement of discipline. 

" V. The Commanding General expects from every officer 
and soldier of the army in the field, an earnest and unhesitating 
support ; and relies with confidence upon an ever kind Provi 
dence for the result. The Lieutenant General commanding the 
armies of the United States, who is now victoriously pressing 
back the enemy, upon their last stronghold, expects much from 
the Army of the Shenaiidoah ; and he must not be disappointed. 

"VI. In conclusion, the Major General commanding, while 
holding every officer to the strictest responsibility of his pos 
ition, and prepared to enforce discipline, with severity, when 
necessary, will never cease to urge the prompt promotion of all 
officers, non commissioned officers, and enlisted men, who earn 
recognition by their gallantry and good conduct. 

By command of 

MAJOR GENERAL HUNTER. 
CHAS. G. HALPINE, 

Assistant Adjutant General." 



294 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

In our Brigade, one shelter tent, only, is allowed for the official 
use of both Adjutant General and Quartermaster. But it is 
graciously permitted to them to have such supply of pens, ink, 
paper and office blanks, as they can induce their clerks to 
carry in their haversacks. 

In seasonable correspondence with these new orders, our 
knapsacks, packed as when they, were sent back from Winches 
ter, were brought up and delivered to us, at inspection to-day. 
To empty them of clothing, and repack them in accordance 
with the new order, was the work nearest our hands. That 
done, our clothing was packed in boxes and delivered to the 
Quartermaster for transportation to the rear. 

26th. Orders issued during the past night directed the 
march of the army at 10:30 A. M. to-day. Just previous to 
getting under arms, an accident happened in the 34th whicli 
cast a gloom over the command. While waiting the order to 
" fall in," Corporals Blanchard and Hubbard of H engaged in 
a frolic, when the latter seized a musket which was supposed 
to be unloaded, and, levelling it at the former with a playful 
remark, pulled the trigger. The piece was discharged, and the 
ball entering Blanchard s forehead near his right eye, killed 
him instantly. He died with hardly a moan. 

29th. Woodstock. We have been encamped just outside the 
village for the last two days. This morning at 5 o clock we 
broke camp and resumed our advance up the valley. We 
halted at Mt. Jackson long enough to enable the boys to 
exchange greetings with our wounded in hospital there. Most 
of them, we were glad to find, were doing well. A goodly 
number of those left there by us on the night of our retreat 
from New Market, had been removed to hospitals, or prisons 
further south. Dr. Allen had gone up to Harrisonburg to look 
after those of ours who had been sent up there. 

We reached " Rhude s Hill " early in the afternoon, and made 
our bivouac near where we formed our last line, and made our 
final stand on the 15th inst. Many solid shot and shells, the 
latter unexploded, were lying around loose. The body of 
" Boston Bar," the Colonel s old bay, was easily recognized. 

Here we were mustered ; our rolls showing present for duty : 



HUNTER S RAID. 295 

Officers, twenty-one ; enlisted men, six hundred and four. 
Prisoners of war officers, six ; enlisted men, sixty-six. 
Absent, sick officers, three ; enlisted men, one hundred and 
forty-five. Died in action, or of wounds received officers, 
one ; enlisted men, twenty-six. 

June 2&gt;d. New Market. We have gone over the battle-field, 
near this village. Many of our wounded still laid in the barns 
and out-houses near where they fell ; others have been taken 
into the town where they could be better cared for by the 
humane among the citizens. Some of them have found a 
ministering angel in a Mrs. Rupert, who, almost alone of the 
ladies of the village, has been untiring in her deeds of kindness. 
In a slight hollow of the field, the bodies of our dead, thrown 
indiscriminately into a pile, and but partially covered with 
earth, presented a sickening sight. Feet, arms, and heads, 
were protruding at all points of this festering mass. The body 
of Capt. Bacon, lying, as he had fallen, among his men, was 
readily identified, and was removed and buried in a separate 
grave. A suitable mound was reared over the remaining 
brave. The grove of cedar trees standing in rear of the ground 
which our regiment held, and the huge oak on the right of our 
line, gave" impressive evidence of the fury of the storm against 
which we had endeavored to stand. Hardly an inch of the 
trunks of these trees but showed the scars of bullets ; and the 
stumps of the great limbs, which had been shot from the oak, 
gave terrible proof of the awful artillery fire directed against 
us. During our short stay here, the regiment was sent on a 
foraging expedition into the neighboring country, and brought 
in ten head of beeves, sixty-six sheep, five good horses, and 
two wagon loads of wheat,, corn, and flour. This, as official 
purveyors, by virtue of general orders, under the authority of 
the General commanding, and for the benefit of the column. 
Something was confiscated for individual account, of which no 
particular return was made. While here news reached us that 
a supply train from Martinsburg, destined for our column, was 
" gobbled" by Harry Gilmor, while on its way through 
"Newtown;" and among those of u ours " captured, was Lieut. 
Platt, of K. Poor fellow ! he will find Dixie a hard road to 
travel. 



296 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

We received reliable information, also, that Bigelow and 
Pellisier, of E., who "fell out" on our march hither, were cap 
tured by some prowling bushwhackers, and shot ; though this 
shooting proved not to be correct, as they subsequently returned 
to their Company. 

June 3d. Harrisonburg . Breaking camp at New Market yes 
terday, at 5 A. M., we marched through the village to the music 
of our Band ; our men exchanging cheers with such of their 
wounded comrades as were able to drag themselves to the doors, 
or windows of their temporary hospitals. A march of about 
twenty-two miles brought us to this place, which we reached at 
about 5 P. M. Our advance charged upon, and drove Imboden s 
rear guard from the village. We found here Lieut. Col. Lin 
coln, and 2d Lieut. R. W. Walker, of the 34th, and about ninety 
of our army, more or less disabled by wounds received on the 
15th ult. They were under the care of Assistant Surgeon Allen, 
of the 34th. We also found about 150 Rebel wounded; our 
advance having been too rapid to allow of their being removed. 
A Provost guard was at once established, and strong Patrols 
detailed to search the village for stores of any kind which would 
replenish our commissariat. The special order of the General 
commanding, exempted from this search, the houses of such of 
the citizens, as in return for their kind attentions to our 
wounded, had been given protection by Col. Lincoln. Conspic 
uous among them were the families of Col. Asa S. Gray, by 
whom our wounded had been fed and kindly nursed ; Dr. Geo. 
K. Gilmer, a Mr. Lewis, and Mr. Baker ; the last, our old 
acquaintance of last Winter s campaign. We secured a con 
siderable quantity of flour, bacon, wheat and tobacco. A print 
ing press, with its font of type, was unearthed from its hiding 
place in the ground, where it had been buried. This, because 
of the rank treason of its owner, was destroyed. 

The hospitals were visited by Departmental, Division, and 
both Brigade Headquarters. Our wounded were found to be 
suffering for want of supplies of every kind. No medicines, no 
bandages, nothing, in fact, which their condition required, had 
been at any time furnished by the Rebel authorities. They 
were dependent upon the generosity of a few warm hearted 



HUNTER S RAID. 297 

Union families for every article of food consumed, save, in the 
language of the country, coarse "sheep meat." And, except as 
tender-hearted ladies contributed articles of underwear to be 
torn up for bandages, they had none. An ample supply of stores,* 
such as tea, coffee, sugar, rice and flour, from the Quartermas 
ter s stores, and a liberal contribution of the most indispensible 
articles from the medical department and the Sanitary Commis 
sion, was left for their use. Also, boots, under clothing, and a 
uniform complete for each of their number. The Rebel hospi 
tal was also visited, its inmates paroled, and their wants, not 
only present, but prospective, amply provided for. 

Better than all these supplies, however, so far as good effect 
upon our wounded was concerned, was Gen. Hunter s solemn 
assurance that upon his arrival at Stanton, he would send a 
train of ambulances, in which those poor fellows should have 
transportation back to Martinsburg a promise he failed to 
keep as he sent it to our lines by way of Beverly. It may 
well enough be added here, that life went out with some, as day 
by day, hope of release vanished. 

During the stay here, there was much signalling, with, 
rockets, from the high ground at Headquarters. There was 
hope, in this way, of opening communication with Generals 
Crook and Averill, both of whom, it was thought, might be in 
the neighborhood of " Stanton." No answering signals were 
seen, however. Instead of the hoped-for messages from these 
officers, we were given reliable information that our direct 
route to Stanton was blocked at " Mt. Crawford," about seven 
miles distant, where strong earthworks had been thrown up, 
behind which 110 inconsiderable force of Rebel soldiers lay 
encamped. 

4th. We resumed our march at 5 o clock this morning, 
moving through the village, to the music of our several bands 
and drum corps. Many citizens followed the column, moved 



* On the following Tuesday, a party of Rebel soldiers, commanded by one who 
announced himself as Capt. Jourdan, and who claimed to belong to General Rosser s 
Brigade, entered the hospital and robbed it, as they had previously the one at New 
Market, of all the chloroform, morphine and quinine it contained; all the spirits, sugar, 
coffee, they could carry off in their blankets; besides boots and articles of under cloth 
ing, and an entire uniform suit for each man of the party. 



298 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

perhaps partly from curiosity as to the exact route we might 
take, and partly from anxiety as to the fate which was in store 
for us ; some, confessedly for plunder, which they hoped to 
secure along the line of march. Very soon after leaving 
Harrisonburg, the column was sub-divided; the cavalry and 
artillery keeping along the pike, as if with the purpose of 
marching directly against the earthworks at Mt. Crawford ; one 
column of infantry diverging to the left, while ours was urged 
rapidily toward, and over the old battle ground of Cross Keys, 
and so on to " Port Republic." On the march we overtook and 
burned a train of wagons, which, loaded with material of war, 
had been driven, from Harrisonburg, a s we approached that 
place. Very curiously, the authorities there had thought it 
best to remove the records and public papers from the various 
county offices, and had had them loaded upon these wagons. 
Of course they were destroyed in the general burning. 

At Port Republic, a large establishment, occupied for the 
manufacture of clothing for the Rebel army, was burned. With 
the building a large amount of clothing was destroyed. 

At this place we crossed Middle River, upon a bridge thrown 
over it by our Pioneers. Then fording a small creek, we 
marched through a small village, and went into camp about a 
mile and a half beyond, in the direction towards Stanton. It 
Avas late when we reached the ground on which we were to 
bivouac. The rain was falling in torrents; and this, and the 
darkness of the night, and the absence of our train, which was 
behind somewhere, rendered our condition anything but 
pleasant.

5th. Reveille was sounded at 4 o clock this morning, and 
about an hour afterwards we were in motion. Crossing the 
road, we moved in the direction of Stanton ; the 1st brigade on 
the right, the 2d (ours) on the left, marching across the fields, 
and through the woods, leaving the roads to be occupied by the 
cavalry and artillery, which had now rejoined us. The enemy 
was soon in sight, and there was much manoeuvring im 
position, on the part of the infantry. The cavalry soon became 
engaged ; and the artillery opened fire, though at long range. 
About 7 o clock we sent forward a strong line of skirmishers, 
which pressed the enemy sharply. He advanced in turn, to 
the music of the Marsellaise Hymn, beautifully rendered by his 
bands. His artillery had got our exact range, and the action 
soon became general. We gradually gained ground. The enemy 
fell back slowly towards Piedmont. Here we found his main 
force strongly entrenched behind rail barricades. Now he 
concentrated his strength against the right of our line, and 
pressed it hard. Our brigade was moved over to its support. 
Upon iiearing the enemy, the 34th "was detached from its 
brigade, and ordered to move, by the left flank, through the 
fields, to a hollow, then to advance in line, facing the woods 
occupied by the enemy." This movement threatened the 
enemy s flank. As we, having gained the hollow, raised the 
crest of the hill beyond, a volley was poured into us, which 
killed four, and wounded others, among whom was our color

bearer, Sergeant Calligan fell; but Corporal Hubbard seized 
the colors before they touched the ground, and they were 
gallantly borne by Corporal Wishart during the remainder of 
the day. Here, at scant twenty yards distance, we delivered 
our fire, and with a cheer, rushed on. The enemy broke back 
into the woods, in some confusion ; our line advanced cheering, 
and the day was seemingly ours. But the enenry rallied, and 
renewed his fire with great fury. Here we had a fair stand up 
fight for about twenty minutes, when suddenly a heavy fire 
broke out on our left, against which a strong force was being 
brought forward. This was the enemy s reserve. Approaching 
down an open road, across which our two left companies now 
extended, it poured a withering fire into our very faces In less 
than five minutes, we lost our Major, Adjutant, senior Captain, 
and fifty-three men killed or wounded. An oblique fire was 
turned upon the enemy, by other of our companies, and a part 
of the 54th Pennsylvania, which was itself engaged in front, 
and his advance was checked. Again it was a fair fight, 
between the two lines, for about fifteen minutes, when the 
enemy broke, our men dashed ahead with a cheer, and carrying 
the barricades, the work was done. Our line re-formed, we 
were ordered into the next piece of woods, where we remained 
during the night. In this affair, Company I, which early in the 
morning had been detached, and sent out on the skirmish line, 
was not engaged with the regiment. 

The loss to the Union arms was four hundred and twenty. Of 
this, the 34th had thirteen killed, and ninety-seven wounded. 
Companies B and D of the extreme left, together losing fifty- 
four men. Over 1000 of the enemy, and sixty officers, among 
them Gen. Vaughn, were captured, Major Gen. Jones, com 
manding, being killed. Among our own wounded were Major 
Pratt, Capt. Potter, Adj t. Woods and Lieut. A. C. Walker, 
(both of whom subsequently died of their wounds, the latter 
in the enemy s hands,) and Lieut. Ripley, who received a 
beautiful wound on the nose, from a flying piece of shell. Late 
in the afternoon, a train with supplies from below, and a small 
mail, reached us. 

An incident or two may, perhaps, be worth relating. 



HUNTER S RAID. 301 

At New Market, one of E s men left the ranks, and made his 
way hurriedly to the rear. As he bore upon his person no 
marks of the fight, and could give no satisfactory explanation 
for leaving the field, charges of " cowardice in the face of the 
enemy " were preferred against him. He had been regarded 
as one of our best men. He was too good a man to lose, at any 
rate, by verdict of court-martial. So lie was called to head 
quarters. " Well, H , how V this ? I am sorry to hear such 

report of you. I need not tell you of the serious consequences 
of such conduct disgrace to your friends and the regiment, 
and death to yourself! What have you to say?" "Not- 
much, Col. ! not much ! But still, I m not to blame." " Not 
to blame ! What do you mean ? " " Why, Col., I had on a 
new pair of shoes that day ; and, do all I could, I could not 
make them stand still ; they would run away ! " With an 
admonition to get rid of the shoes as quick as possible, as such 
conduct would not be overlooked again, poor H was 
dismissed ; and the wisdom of the course was shown by 
to-day s trial, when the man stood arid charged, in line, as 
gallantly as the most lion-hearted among us. 

F, also, had a somewhat similar experience with two of 
its men, D. F. C- , and A. C- , brothers ; recent recruits ; 
great stalwart fellows, whom any officer would regard as an 
acquisition to his command. At New Market, these fellows 
were among the missing. The time and the manner of their 
going was unnoticed. They returned to their Company the next 
day ; one without his musket, the other minus his equipments. 
The story they told, although unsatisfactory, could not be 
disproved. So they were dismissed, with a warning that they 
would be closely watched in future, and would be shot down 
on the spot, upon any attempt to steal away from any engage 
ment. Notwithstanding the warning, A. C- - was found to 
be missing early in the engagement of to-day. D. F. C- . 
however, still kept his place. But at that critical and exciting 
moment, when the enemy was pressing his attack upon our left 
so vigorously, and every officer along our whole line was 
exerting himself to the utmost to hold it unbroken, Lieut. 
Belser was heard to shout, " There goes C- ! d n him ! " 
23 



302 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

and way in the rear could be plainly seen the form of C- , 
as he leaped over the ground in his race from death. With a 
word of caution to his junior, Lieut. Elwell darted in pursuit. 
But he was heavily handicapped ; his short legs beneath his 
full, round body, had no chance in a race Avitli the long limbs 
and sinewy form of his runaway friend, who was leaping away 
like a deer. So, coming to a stop, Elwell drew his pistol, and, 
aiming low, fired. Although unhurt, C- - stopped, and, 
turning, walked back to his officer. "Are you wounded ? " 
asked E. " No, Lieut/ " What were you going to the rear 
for, then ? " " I feel sick, Lieut. ; so sick that I can hardly 
stand up ! " " Not so sick but you can run away, though ! v 
And taking C- - by the collar, Lieut. E. run him up to, and 
through, our lines, and about two rods in advance of his 
Company. Here, standing by his side, the Lieut, talked strong ; 
while poor C- - loaded and fired, till, the Confederates giving 
way, both joined in the final charge which decided the fate of 
the day. 

At a later hour, among a group of officers who were discus 
sing the incidents of the day, was Lieut. Col. Linton, of the 
grand old 54th Pennsylvania. Slapping Lieut. E. on the shoul 
der, and leading him forward, he thus addressed Gen. Sullivan: 
"Here, General; here s an officer who ought to be made a 

Brigadier General ! " and then related the affair with C , 

which he had witnessed. " Yes," growled Sullivan, with all the 
superciliousness which distinguished him I " Yes ; he hid 
behind the other man, didn t he ? " 

It is only to be added, that on the 18th day of the following 

July, this man C , was " killed in battle " at Island Ford. 

Peace to his ashes ! If he was n t a gallant soldier, he poured 
out his life-blood beneath the Flag, and in support of the Gov 
ernment, in whose service he had enlisted. 

His brother deserted on the 30th of the same month, and was 
never heard of afterward. 

6th. The first work of the day was to collect and provide 
for the wounded ; and gather, and appropriate or destroy, such 
trophies of our yesterday s victory, as remained upon the field. 
For this last work a Company of the 123d Ohio was detailed; 



HUNTER S RAID. 303 

and inasmuch as our transportation was limited, the order 
required them to destroy all small arms found on the field. 
Muskets and rifles to the number of 1,250 were collected and 
disposed in alternate layers upon piles of rails ; and the whole 
fired. Although repeatedly cautioned to lay the pieces so that 
their muzzles would point in the same direction, the men became 
careless, and some of them were seriously wounded by the dis 
charge of the arms. 

When this work of destruction was ended, our march was 
resumed. The 34th again brought up the rear. No opposition 
was offered to our progress, and we entered Stanton at about G 
p. M. Marching through the village, our men halted in a field 
of rich young clover, the two essentials of a soldier s life, run 
ning water and a nice rail fence close at hand. 

The beautiful grounds and extensive buildings of the State 
Asylum for the deaf and dumb were occupied for hospital 
purposes. 

The next morning, early, we were again upon the road ; but 
after going about eight miles, getting reliable information that 
Gens. Crook and Averill were near Stanton, we countermarched 
and re-occupied our camp ground. About two hundred of our 
wounded were brought up from the battle field of Piedmont, 
and placed in hospital here. Among those too severely wounded 
to be moved was Lieut. A. C. Walker, of ours, who lingered 
till the 14th, when he died. 

8th. We have been busy, all day, in searching the town for 
" contraband of war; seizing and bringing into camp provisions 
of every description, including tobacco ; and destroying all pub 
lic property stored in the place, as well as the buildings used for 
manufacturing clothing or supplies of any kind for the enemy. 
Generals Averill and Crook reached the place to-day, and 
encamped their commands near by. To use the language of 
the natives, " there s a riglit smart chance of Yanks in town. 

Col. Wells is assigned to the command of the 1st Brigade, 
vice Moore, of the 28th Ohio, who returns with his Regiment, 
its term of service having expired. Our prisoners, such of our 
wounded as can bear transportation, and a long train of wagons 
are to be sent to our lines under escort of his command. In 



304 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

consequence of this change in command of the Brigade, the 
34th, now under Capt. Thompson, is transferred to the 1st 
Brigade, in place of the 18th Connecticut, sent to the 2d. 
Thus we enjoy the gratification of seeing our Colonel s services 
rewarded, and of being under the command of an able soldier. 
Major Pratt will remain with the column ; riding, for the pres 
ent, in an ambulance. Adjutant Woods, wounded in the shoul 
der, will go home on sick leave ; so will Capt. Potter. General 
Orders assign Lieut. Bacon to the Brigade Staff, as A. A. A. G. ; 
and Lieut, and R. Q. M. Rowland, to be A. B. Q. M. Lieut. 
Ripley is detailed as Acting Regimental Adjutant.

LIBERTY ON THE ROAD. 

10th. The work of destroying public property, tearing up 
railroad tracks, and the banks and locks of the canal, and 
gathering in provisions, and such articles as will be of value to 
the army, has given employment to our Boys, and those of the 
other commands, since our arrival. So that the enemy was 
despoiled, it mattered little what became of the property ! 
Hence the men have had no hesitation in appropriating to their 
own use, whatever would contribute to their personal comfort. 

We had been on short allowance of tobacco, for instance, for 
many days ; and all, who used "the weed," in any form, laid in 
a liberal supply. No one perhaps was so greedy as Finn, of A, 
who, in his anxiety lest he should be on short rations again, 
emptied his knapsack of every article it contained, and packed 
it full of what, to him, was better than " victuals and drink." 

The work of destruction having been completed, we started 
again at five o clock this morning, on our march up the Valley. 
The army was divided into three separate columns. Averill 
moving on the left or eastern route ; Crook on the western or 
right ; while Hunter marched on roads between the others 

Our destination is understood to be Lexington ; distant about 
36 miles from Stanton. Our route is through a most beautiful 
country ; extensive fields of luxuriant wheat bordering each 



806 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

side of the roads. As we advanced, we came upon, and passed 
several camps, which the enemy had but just abandoned, and 
captured a few of his straggling soldiers. A supply train of 
two hundred and fifty wagons, which had succeeded in getting 
through from Martinsburg, overtook us on our day s march. 
Inasmuch as it brought, among its other good things, a large 
mail, we were doubly glad to see it. Reaching Fairfax, eighteen 
miles from Stanton, we encamped. 

\\th. Revielle was sounded at 4 A. M., and at five, we were 
again in motion. Our Artillery, Cavalry, and train occupied 
the Pike. The 1st Brigade moving across the country on the 
right, and the 2d Brigade on the left, in lines parallel with the 
highway, tramp through wide fields of grain, so luxuriant in 
growth, as to hide from view the bodies of the foot soldiers. 
Nothing but the gleaming lines of steel betray the presence of 
an armed body. Nearing Lexington, and when within a few 
miles of it, we heard the sound of rapid Artillery firing. It came 
from Crook ; whose men, marching by a different route, had 
come in, in our front. After a short engagement, the rebels hur 
riedly retreated, and crossing the River, (James) destroyed the 
bridge which spanned it. We made our bivouac on the north 
side of the river, near its bank, about a mile outside the town. 

~L2th. About 10 A. M. orders reached us, directing our cross 
ing of the river, and march into, and occupation of, the town. 
We made our camp on the hill east of the Military Academy. 
The work of destruction was going on as we marched in. 
Nevertheless we were directed to try our hands at it. Several 
large mills, many warehouses, with all their contents, the gas 
works, arsenal, magazine, were fired and wholly consumed. The 
Military Institute,* home of the Cadets, our gallant little 
enemies of New Market, with its library, and all the buildings 
connected with it, were fired and burned to the ground. The 
beautiful private residence of Governor Letcher was also 
destroyed. Washington College was raided upon, and despoiled 
of the beautiful marble statue of Washington, which ornamented 
its halls ; upon what principle, it was difficult to tell, as it 



Our troops were fired upon from this building,

neither could give aid and comfort to the enemy, nor be of any 
service to our arms. Till now, this region had known nothing 
of the ravages of war. Neither party has occupied it, nor has it 
before been even visited by our forces. Of course the lamen 
tation on the part of the white population, is both loud and deep. 
The negroes, on the other hand, are wild with joy, and throng 
our camps, giving information and proffering assistance. Many 
of them engaged as officer s servants ; others followed with the 
command, actuated by the hope of a successful escape into our 
lines. Within sight of our encampment, are to be seen "fields 
of wheat, the yield from which, except that our horses and 
mules are turned upon them, to graze, would seem to be enough 
to supply the wants of Lee s entire .army. Lovely indeed, 
almost beyond conception of those who have never seen it, is 
this whole region ! 

13/i. The weather has been pleasant since we started on 
this expedition. It continues delightful ; though the morning 
air is somewhat cool. We have had an accession to the strength 
of our Brigade ; the 15^d and 161st Ohio having been added to 
it. The work of destruction still goes on. To-day, among 
other property, seven canal boats, loaded chiefly with produce, 
but bearing some ammunition, and having upon their decks five 
pieces of artillery, were captured, fired and burned. Gen. 
Duffee, of Crook s command, joined to-day. He has scouted to 
within seven miles of Lynchburg ; lias cut the Charlottesville 
Railroad in several places ; and run into Imboden, capturing 
from that officer some eighty prisoners, five pieces of artillery, 
not far from 300 wagons, with many (rumor has it 700) horses 
and mules ; blown up several locks upon the James River Canal, 
and destroyed a considerable number of boats, some of them 
laden with ammunition. We found and destroyed a printing 
press, which had been buried in the woods. 

14^. Marching orders were received at two ; and line was 
formed at five, although we did not actually move till six o clock 
this morning. Crook has the advance ; and our division guards 
the train, which is very large. We take with us, in our wagons, 
in place of hard tack and meat, the beautiful statue of 
Washington, removed from the college here. Some of us think 



808 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

that food for the body would be more legitimate spoils of war. 
We are aiming for " Buckhannon," which is twenty-four miles 
from " Lexington/ The road is rough, crooked and rocky, with 
occasional deep holes, which cause us no little trouble, and 
considerable delay. Our route led us within two miles of the 
Natural Bridge, but there was no time for hunting or examining 
curiosities. The bridges which spanned the creeks were 
guarded by small parties of Rebel soldiers, and were invariably 
fired at our appearance. Generally, oi&gt;r advance was near 
enough to prevent their destruction. We came in sight of 
Buckhannon at about 8 P. M. The infantry crossed the river in 
boats ; the cavalry and artillery forded, losing several mules 
and wagons, in the darkness. " We are now in a wild and 
mountainous country. The scenery along our route is beautiful 
beyond description." The land, although generally in a pretty 
good state of cultivation, is apparently less productive than in 
the lower part of the Valley. 

" Our hard tack is now all gone ; Hour is getting scarce, 
u though we still have beef and mutton in plenty." 

~L5th. Again early on the road ; reveille having roused us at 
4 o clock. "The weather has been very hot, and we have 
" suffered much. We are crossing the Blue Ridge. The 
u scenery along the route is magnificent; mountain is piled 
" high upon mountain. Far above our heads, we catch occa- 
" sional glimpses of the moving column, the heavy rumbling 
" of the artillery carriages coming to our ears, like the low mut- 
" tering of distant thunder ; far below us, we see the wagon 
" train, as it winds along its slow and heavy way. The road, in 
" places, is very narrow, and its windings short and sharp ; and 
" several of our wagons went down the almost precipitous sides 
" of the mountain, while the drivers were endeavoring to make 
"the passage, near the summit." Here and there, upon the 
road, laid stretched the body of a dead Guerrilla, shot by our 
advance, while ambushed for their devilish game of bush 
whacking. It was matter of great surprise to us, that so little 
obstruction was made to our passage ; so steep was the ascent 
of the mountain, and so narrow and difficult the road. A small 
and resolute band would have found it easy work to have held 



HUNTERS RAID. 



at bay, in the Gap, our whole column. Bubbling up from the 
mountain top, and from places on the pathway up its side, were 
springs of delicious water, which gave us much needed refresh 
ment. 

We made our night s bivouac in the gap between the " Peaks 
of Otter." The men were completely tired out, although our 
day s march had been only eleven miles. Spite of General 
Orders, there has been a little foraging on private account ; 
and though our teams are behind, we shan t all suffer for want 
of something eatable. 

16th. Reveille again before daylight, and we on the way 
soon after. The road doivn the mountain was rough and 
uneven, which made our march very tiresome. By afternoon 
we reached Liberty, and passing on about five miles, came to 
the river. Here again, as at so many other streams, the bridge 
had been burned ; and the Infantry crossed on a narrow foot 
bridge, while the Cavalry, Artillery, and train, forded. Our 
march to-day was about fifteen miles, and having made the 
crossing, we encamped for the night. Our advance destroyed. 
several bridges, and many miles of track of the Virginia and 
East Tennessee Railroad, which runs through this place. As 
Ave entered the town, we heard the sound of cannonading 
proof that Averill was up with the enemy.

llth. Reveille was sounded at 3.30 this morning, and our 
march was taken up without delay ; a part of our wagon train, 
under escort of two one hundred days regiments, having been 
first detached and ordered to the rear. Soon after leaving 
camp we came up to another bridge which had been fired. 
Here we were delayed some four hours while the Pioneer 
Corps were repairing the damage. About 2 p. M. we came up 
with Crook and Averill, whose columns were halted and were 
waiting our arrival. We had a good deal of skirmishing all 
day, and, when within about four miles of Lynchburg, found 
the enemy in strong force. Averill opened upon them with 
his guns, but was forced to fall back upon Crook, who was 
posted strongly in a piece of woods, and who in his turn 
charged, drove the enemy back, and took from him two twenty 
pounder Parrotts. We heard, at intervals during the afternoon, 
the screeching of locomotives and the rumbling of cars as they 
were rolled into the city. These noises, and the loud hurrahs 
of the men in the enemy s lines, gave plain indication of the 
arrival of reinforcements. If this is true to any considerable 
extent, our work, hard enough before, will be still more 
difficult. Meanwhile, we have made our bivouac on the 
ground occupied by the Rebel Artillery, part of whose pieces 



HUNTER S RAID. 311 

were taken. Our pickets are within speaking distance of the 
Rebel line. We can hear the noise of their chopping parties, 
and are kept from sleep by the firing which is quite brisk 
between the men of the two lines. The enemy s skirmish line 
is made up of sharp-shooters, many of whom, armed with long- 
range rifles, and concealed in the tree tops, do severe execution. 

Slow as has been the advance of our army since it left Stan- 
ton, the Rebel Gen. Breckenridge, during the entire time, 
seems to have been singularly at a loss as to its whereabouts 
and probable destination, as the following telegrams, copied 
from Gen. Breckenridge s order book, found and taken at Lynch- 
burg, at our occupation of that place, subsequent to the 
"surrender at Appomatox," will show. 

On the 9th inst., he, then at Lynchburg, telegraphed Gen. 
Lee at Richmond, that : 

" Crook and Hunter have united; are said to be strong, with great deal of Artil 
lery; and from Rock Fish Gap, on the 10th, to Gen. Imbodeii. Do not allow your 
communications with my main body to be interrupted ; and to Ma jor Harry Gilmor, 
Report to me at once where you are, and what you are doing. Yesterday evening 
two hundred and fifty wagons of the enemy, weakly guarded, reached Stanton. You 
must spare a man often to communicate with me. Again, on the llth, he telegraphed 
Irnboden: I have report at this moment of enemy s Cavalry passing through Reed s 
and Tye River Gaps. Overtake, engage, and whip him. You hare the force to do it. 
Use great expedition. Two days afterwards he sent the same officer a despatch, as 
follows; Communicate with me by all possible means: I wish especially to know if 
enemy s Cavalry and Artillery have crossed the Blue Ridge; and ^vhere they are. 
And on the next day, as follows: It is reported that enemy, at Lexington, struck 
tents Sunday evening. Lose no time in finding their direction. Again on the 15th, 
in evident impatience, perhaps in some ill temper, he telegraphed Imbodeu : I do not 
believe there is any enemy north of the James, and east of the Blue Ridge; and 
except a small raiding party there has been none since Sunday last. If you are north 
of James River, and not in the immediate presence of the enemy, return here at once. 
He telegraphed Gen. Bragg, at Richmond, on the same date: Enemy reported to be 
advancing, in force not known, from Liberty, in Bedford County. The Cavalry, under 
Imboden, doing less than nothing. If a good General officer cannot be sent at once for 
them, they will go to ruin. At 1.30 P. M. of the IGth, he telegraphed Gen. Early at 
Charlotteville: No enemy now west of Blue Ridge. There is no Cavalry of enemy 
north of Lynchburg, and the roads leading to Railroad and Charlottesville, are 
picketed. And again, an hour later: I sent repeated orders, as I moved here, for 
the Cavalry to see the enemy, and report facts. But you know the habits of some of 
them. To Imboden he telegraphed: I don t hear anything from you, or the enemy. 
Where is your command? and what is the news of the enemy? If he don t advance, 
you might go after him, and try to re-occupy Liberty. Send out brave and intelligent 
scouting parties to see him. I want you to find his position, and purposes, at all 
hazards. 

" No relief to this state of uncertainty seems to have been derived from this appeal 



312 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

to his subordinate officer; since at 3:30 he telegraphed Early again that he learns 
little or nothing through the Cavalry; and has no information that enemy is press 
ing; my fear is that he will go away. 

" At a later hour of the same day, however, when communicating to Gen. Vaughn 
the fact that he is unable to take command to-day, and giving direction as to the dis 
position of troops around the city, he adds: There is no occasion for any disorder. 
The enemy is advancing slowly. We will have Gen. Early and large re-inforcements 
to-morrow morning, and if enemy comes in earnest, he will be destroyed. 

"Despite this confident tone, however, he despatched to Gen. Bragg, at Richmond, 
as late as 9 A. M., of the 17th, that he had some fears that the enemy (would), will 
not attack Lynchburg, but will move from New London towards Danville Railroad. 
And his uncertainty upon that head seems not to have been removed till later in the 
afternoon of that day, hours after the skirmishers of the two armies had become 
engaged, when he despatched Gen. Vaughn an order to be prepared to meet the 
enemy at once. " 



Our troops succeeded, last evening, in forcing back 
the enemy behind his intrenchments, and the men of both. 
armies laid within a few hundred yards of each other. The 
Rebel working parties were engaged all night in strengthening 
their fortifications, which look to be strongly made. At about 
8 A. M. we were quietly roused, and stood to our arms, in 
anticipation of being attacked. Crook and Averill moved 
their troops at an early hour ; the one to the right, the other 
to the left, against the flanks of the enemy. About sunrise, 
the Rebels opened the ball, sending a shell from their earth 
works in our front. Our batteries quickly replied, and for 
about a half hour there was quite a sharp artillery fire. " The 
Johnnies," having ascertained our position, ceased to shell us, 
and our batteries soon quieted down. Our boys, tired, sleepy, 
and hungry, are lying in line, in the woods, undisturbed by the 
occasional minie or shell which comes whizzing over their 
heads. We are waiting anxiously to hear from Crook or 
Averill, on our right or left. There it comes ! Clear to the 
left we hear Duine s cannon ! Our scouts are coming in from 
the front, with the information that the Rebels are in line of 
battle ! Now 12 M. our skirmishers are busy. Here they 
come ! closely followed by the Johnnies, who are charging, and 
yelling like mad ! As they come into view, our batteries open 
upon them, with terrible effect. The shells thrown by their 
artillery in reply, for the most part, pass high over our heads. 
As the Rebels gain the hill, on the crest of which our brigade 



HUNTER S RAID. 313 

is lying, we rise, give them a volley, and, charging, drive them 
back to their works, re-establishing our skirmishers in advance 
of their former line. The fighting now became general, and 
was quite sharp for about two hours. Constant and heavy 
skirmishing was continued till after dark, especially severe on 
our left. From prisoners, taken by us, we learn that Brecken- 
ridge has been heavily reenforced; Early, with his corps, 
having reached the place, although his artillery, as yet, is not 
all up. We are not ivhipped ! In fact, we are holding our 
own, and a little more. But if we wait here till morning, we 
shall have on our hands more than we can conveniently 
manage ! " I quote from a letter written by Major Pratt : 

"1 have not time or space to describe the entire fight : but it raged for an hour and 
a half with a desperate fury. Before the desperate onset of the enemy, our lines 
seemed at first to recoil. After swaying back and forth, our entire line finally made a 
charge, and drove the enemy into and over his first line of works. For a moment, the 
stars and stripes, borne by the color bearer of the 116th Ohio, were seen waving from 
the enemy s breastworks; but the word was given to withdraw, and soon our troops 
occupied nearly their former lines." 

The entire loss in this affair to the Union arms, was about 
two hundred. The 34th suffered severely, losing Sergeant 
King (orderly sergeant ) of E, Woodward of D, Breeiie of H, 
arid Martin of K, killed ; and Capt. Lovell, seven iion-commis- 
sioned officers, and thirty-eight privates, wounded. We buried 
our dead, and gathered in our wounded. " All fires upon the 
picket line are prohibited, and orders are whispered about that 
we are to retire from before the place." At about 8 P. M., with 
a caution to the men to be careful, lest the noise of their 
equipments should betray our movements, we started on our 
backward march. We left Lieut. Goodrich, with his company, 
upon the picket line, entirely ignorant of the intended retreat. 
At a later hour he drew off his command, and overtook the 
column during the night. At about 11 P. M., having marched 
about fourteen miles, we were allowed to rest for an hour. 
Getting 011 to the road again, we reached Liberty at about 3 
A. M. ; and, pushing on about three miles beyond the town, 
w^eiit into camp. A liebel party charged our rear guard before 
we were fairly out of the village, and quite a severe skirmish 



814 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

ensued. Before ranks were broken, orders were promulgated, 
directing the train to continue on the road, and the men to 
follow in two hours. "So we lie on the ground, in readiness to 
move at a moment s warning." 

K)th. " With the exception of a halt for about an hour 
"for meals, we have been pushed ahead, without stopping, on 
"the road to Salem. Both men and horses are completely 
"jaded. Besides the loss of rest and sleep, both are suffering 
" from want of food and water. Less than half rations are 
" issued to us, and it is impossible to obtain anything by for- 



" aging. 



20th. At 2 A. M. we were roused and pushed forward. The 
trains were started ahead, and we followed at a rapid step. 
" The enemy are close up, and pursuing vigorously. The men 
" and animals are completely worn down ; men dropping by the 
" wayside, and animals constantly giving out. The men get 
" scarcely anything to eat. Our horses have hardly once been 
"unharnessed since the battle, and are seldom halted, except to 
" graze, for a short time." At about 2 P. M., having made 21 
miles, we were allowed to rest. At 6, orders came to get in 
readiness to move. Our wagon train was started off at once ; 
and about an hour afterwards the column was put in motion. 
We marched all night, reaching and passing through Salem 
about daylight. 

" The prospect ahead of us is not very cheering. If we are 
" able to continue a day or two longer, we shall save ourselves 
" and the greater part of our material. But we are nearly 
" exhausted ; our teams worn out ; there is neither rations for 
" man or beast ; the country is poor, and thinly settled, giving 
" no chance for successful foraging, even if we had the opportu- 
" nity, which we have not ; and the enemy is giving us much 
" trouble." Still, while there is life there is hope of coming- 
out all right, though the prospect of a brilliant termination of 
this expedition is not flattering. We suffer a good deal from 
the weather, which is now, as it has been for weeks, very warm ; 
and for want of rain, of which we have had none for weeks. 

21s. " Our march was interrupted this morning, when we 
" were within about two miles of Salem, by a fire poured into 



HUNTER S KAID. 315 

44 us by a party of about one thousand Rebels, who had con- 
44 cealed themselves in a piece of woods, on our right. They 
44 hoped, doubtless, to detain us long enough to enable another 
44 body of their troops to gain the Gap, on the road between 
44 Salem and Newcastle, through which ice must pass, if we pass 
44 at all. Leaving this body on our right, we pushed on, and 
44 overtook our train, which had stopped about a mile out, to 
44 enable the animals to graze. About 10 o clock AVC halted, 
" having marched about fifteen miles. 

44 As Crook s division (the rear guard) came up, it became 
44 engaged with the force we had left. We turned tAvo pieces 
44 of our artillery upon this party, to aid Crook ; and woke up 
44 a tire from one of their pieces, in return. While this affair 
44 was going on, our train and artillery, for some cause, was 
44 hitched up and driven on. It was 12 o clock when it occurred 
44 to those in authority that it was a good thing to have infantry 
u somewhere near a train moving in an enemy s country ; and 
44 orders Avere sent to us to move out and overtake it. We 
44 reached Newcastle without having overtaken it. About a 
44 mile beyond, word was brought us to hurry forward, as fast 
44 as possible ; as Guerrillas had cut the train, near the entrance 
44 to the Gap, and were fast destroying it. We found that 
44 McCausland, Avith a party of cavalry, had shot the horses, 
44 attached to a part of the artillery, and was busy in destroying 
44 the caissons and limbers. Our approach stopped the work of 
44 destruction ; but the} had already broken up sixteen guns, 
44 with" their appurtenances. They got aAvay with three pieces. 
44 We Avere obliged to abandon five others, for Avant of spare 
44 horses; but Ave first rendered them unserA T iceable. Some one 
"had evidently blundered! In this forced march AVC made six 
44 miles in an hour and a half; which, taking into consideration 
44 the jaded condition of "the boys," and the fact that the route 
44 Avas over a steep mountain road, AVC called pretty good. 
44 After we had overtaken the train, an hour s halt was allowed 
44 us. Then we pushed forward again ; crossed another range 
44 of mountains, and went into camp, about twelve miles from 
44 Newcastle. The distance marched since 8:80 o clock last 
44 evening was twentv-seveii miles."

22c?. For a wonder, we were permitted to rest last night ; 
and, as the order of march is changed, the train to be moved in 
the rear, to-day, under the protection of our Brigade, we are all 
" lying around loose," this forenoon, enjoying ourselves as much 
as possible. At li o clock we got under arms. After a leis 
urely march, we encamped again at 10i p. M. ; distance marched, 
twelve miles. Before entering the Gap, last night, Crook, who 
had heard of the little affair of the train, arranged a little sur 
prise party for the Johnnies, who had been hanging on to his 
rear. Leaving a small rear guard well behind, he placed a 
handsome force in ambush, by the side of the road. The Grey- 
backs, thinking they had a sure thing, charged. Our little 
party retreated ; and when the Johnnies had got well into the 
mouth of the trap set for them, our boys rose up, fired, killing 
eighteen ; and charged, capturing eighty more of them.

23^. Reveille was sounded at 4 o clock this morning. On 
the inarch to-day, our Brigade was distributed through the 
whole length of the train ; one Company between every two 
wagons. We crossed TVelve-mile Mountain, as it is called, from 
its being five miles to its summit on the west side, and seven to 
its base on the east side. Crossing the next succeeding range, 
we reached " Sweet Springs " at 2i A. M., where we went into 
camp. Day s march twenty-live miles. There was neither sleep 
nor rest for the men, for the whole night was made noisy by the 
rumbling of the wagons, which were late in coining in. owing 
to the extreme heat, and the bad condition of the animals. We 
were compelled to abandon many wagons ; also horses and 
mules in large number. As these last fell, they were shot, and 
with the wagons, rolled off the mountain side. 

24A. We have had a good rest. Our camp is near the 
springs, the water of which is very delicious. This place, in 
anti bellum days, was a fashionable resort. The hotel is of 
brick, three stories high, about four hundred feet long, with an 
L of about one hundred arid fifty feet. The dining room is 
about three hundred feet by fifty, resplendent with mirrors, 
24 



318 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

which fairly cover the entire walls. Much of the furniture, 
which is of the richest quality, even now remains. About a 
mile distant is Avhat is called "Red Sweet Springs," where 
there is standing another large hotel building, but of wood. 
Around the main buildings are many small cottages used as 
family residences through the summer months ; bathing houses, 
etc. All these buildings are unoccupied, save by a few negroes 
who seem to be in charge. We have fairly revelled in the 
waters, while enjoying the short rest. 

At about 3 P. M., we started on the road to " White Sulphur 
Springs," which place we reached about -2 A. M. The weather 
was intensely hot. Our route was over a fine road, running 
between the ranges of mountains. The march was wearisome 
indeed. Its monotony was relieved once or twice, by the firing 
at us of a few shots, after dusk, by a little party of busli- 
wackers, who laid concealed by the wayside. 

2bth. The boys have been on short allowance for some days, 
and are now suffering, actually suffering for want of food. It 
is more than a week since they have had any bread. " I have 
seen a dollar offered for a cup of coffee, and a five dollar 
greenback for a single "hard tack." Our horses and mules 
are also suffering for want of forage. Vegetation here is not so 
far advanced as it w T as where we were a week ago. Cherries 
are scarce ! Gooseberries green, and Onions small ! We started 
about 3 p. M., on our weary way ; reached Lewisburg about 11, 
and continuing on about four miles farther, halted at about 
1 A. M. We passed quite near the White Sulphur Springs ; 
the water bubbles up from a natural basin in the center of a, 
beautiful valley, the spring itself being sheltered by a neat 
summer house, built over it. The water is strongly impregnated 
with sulphur. The principal building, three stories high, from 
four to five hundred feet long, with a basement its entire 
length, stands nearly in the centre of this basin. Back against 
the sides of the hills, are numerous cottages for family occupa 
tion, with broad and well shaded piazzas, extending entirely 
around them, and windows springing from the floors. Some 
little distance from the Springs, we came to numerous well 
constructed earthworks. These were thrown up last December, 
by order of the Keb^l General Echols, in order to stay Averill, 



HUNTER S KAID. 319 

011 his retreat from his raid upon Saltville. They are very 
strong, and so placed as to be impregnable to a direct assault. 
Averill succeeded in thinking them, and so escaped from his 
pursuers. Just at dusk, we reached Green river. The scene 
while fording, was magnificent beyond description. The waters 
were spread out near two hundred yards wide, and Avere about 
two feet deep. For a distance of near a quarter of a mile, the 
river was fairly crowded with men. The prisoners of the 
division were just ahead of our brigade ; and " grey backs " and 
" blue bellies," were mixed well together. Cavalry men were 
mingled here and there in the crowd, many of the horses made 
to carry double. The artillery and wagons crossed more by 
themselves. Over this scene, the sun shone clear, its beams 
glancing brightly from our bayonets. The whole formed a 
sight, which would repay one for a good deal of such fatigue, 
and hunger, as we have experienced. 

"The men are," writes Maj. Pratt in a letter of this date, "completely exhausted , 
owing to a lack of food. They have had but six ounces of flour, per man, for the 
whole of the last ./we days ; no hard bread. All coffee and sugar is gone; in fact, there* 
is nothing more to issue, except fresh beef from cattle driven along with us; and we 
are sixty miles from Gauley, the nearest depot. The men are so completely wearied 
by the severity of their labors and marches, and insufficiency of food, that very many 
drop by the roadside, too weary and faint to keep up with the column." Of the con 
dition of his men, at this time, said Gen. Crook: " hundreds of my men are starring 
by the loayside, in the rear," 



We started at 5 o clock this morning, passing on our 
way " Meadow Bluffs," and many earthworks and rifle-pits 
thrown up along the road. About noon a halt was ordered 
which lasted about four hours. This was made that the men 
might rest, and receive their ration of meat from beeves driven 
along with us, and knocked down, killed, and distributed, upon 
reaching camp; eaten, in many cases, raw and quivering. 
Resuming the march, we continued on till about dusk, when we 
halted for the night. We hope that a provision train may 
meet us to-morrow, for our boys are actually starving. The 
country has been stripped clean by the troops who have pre 
ceded us, and there is literally nothing eatable left. Except 
the fresh meat, and a very little coffee, there is nothing to be 
issued. " T saw fifty cents offered, in vain, to-day, for a narrow 
strip of bacon, not two inches long." 



320 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 



Started at 3 this morning, and halted about noon for 
an hour, when meat and a little coffee was issued. " The boys 
look so gaunt, and are so hungry, it makes one s heart ache to 
see them." " At the halt I saw two dollars offered and refused 
for one small griddle cake" But we are promised rations before 
the day closes. We are now lying at the foot of- the " Big 
Sewall Mountain," having marched sixteen miles to-day, and 
come up with Headquarters of the division. Hark ! how the 
boys are cheering ! All hardships seem to have been forgotten ; 
and men but just able to drag themselves along on the march 
to-day, are shouting, and dancing, and running around as if 
crazy. A train (now 7 P. M.,) with two days rations of hard 
tack, sugar and coffee, and bacon, is just coming up. Our 
Brigade teams are up to-night ; but many horses have been 
turned out and abandoned to-day, and those now in harness 
are badly played out. AverilPs command, which for a while 
has been in the rear, is passing our camp at this moment. " I 
am told that five of his men died to-day of actual starvation." 
Large as has been the loss of property, and it has been very 
large since we commenced our retreat, it has been as nothing- 
compared to the privation and suffering the boys have had to 
bear. But we trust our hardships are nearly over, as we are 
within one day s march of Gauley bridge, and plenty. 

28/i. We were 011 our way again at 4 o clock this morning. 
A nice rain last night, (the first since we left Stan ton) laid the 
dust, and left about two inches of mud through which to march. 
But we have had so much dust as actually to enjoy the present 
muddy road. At noon a halt was ordered. We made a good 
dinner, at which hard-tack figured largely ; and made a good 
march in the afternoon, camping for the night just west of the 
road leading to " Summerville," having made sixteen miles 
during the day. 

We are beginning to get out of the woods; having passed on 
our day s march good farms and farm-houses ; an agreeable 
change from occasional rough log huts, and almost interminable 
forests and mountains. Some of our Virginia comrades are 
now at home. " I saw one of them standing guard, to-day, at 
his father s door ; and soon after stopped at the house of a Mr. 



HUNTER S RAID. 321 

George Hunt, from whom I learned that he was a native of 
Franklin county, Massachusetts ; and had four sons in the 
Union service." We are now among Union people, and hence 
forth there is to be no pillaging. It seeems hard ! (for we have 
got fairly broken in, having practiced where there was little or 
nothing to be " scooped in,") now that the prospect looks fair, or 
would but for the fact that we are among friends. 

29th. Reveill6 at 5 o clock this morning, soon after which 
we were on the road. Our route laid over the Gauley Moun 
tains, about nine miles to the bridge, and the river of that 
name, and to the Union lines. Soon after starting, we came to 
the far-famed " Lover s Leap," " Maiden Bluff," and " Hawk s 
Nest." From this last point, a scene of indescribable beauty and 
grandeur greets the eye of the beholder. The road runs along 
within about one hundred feet of the brow of the bluff; the 
cliff, so bold, and precipitous, that one can easily toss a stone 
into the waters of the " New River," winding nine hundred feet 
below. So crooked is its course, that the view does not extend 
more than two or three miles down the stream ; and up, it is cut 
off by wooded mountains, piled one upon another far above. 
" Yesterday, I thought we were getting out of the woods ; but 
to-day, it seems as if we were in deeper than ever. The change 
is, however, an agreeable one. Every step we take, some new 
beauty is presented to the eye. The Rhododendrons are in the 
full splendor of their bloom, and are very abundant. (They 
were fading when we crossed the Blue Ridge, ten days ago.) As 
we advance, we catch occasional glimpses of the river, far below 
us, but the descent, although steep, is nowhere so precipitous 
as at the " Hawk s Nest." After a while, turning a point of 
the mountain, far in front, and far below us, the " Great 
Kanawha," formed by the junction of the waters of the " New," 
with the " Gauley " River, bursts upon our view. Winding 
down the mountain side, the Cliffs, on our right, overhang and 
seem ready to drop upon our heads. We reached " Gauley 
Bridge," to find no bridge there ; it having been burned early in 
the war. Our wagon train and Artillery crossed the river in 
ferry boats ; the Infantry on a foot bridge laid from rock to 
rock in the bed of the stream, while the Cavalry forded. We 
found the Post held by some one hundred days men. 



CHAPTER XXXIV. 



HUNTER S RAID. 

"WE BREATH EASIER" AN INCIDENT THE "CRITTER RODE 
WELL" MAJOR PRATT SERGEANT MAJOR BLAKE. 

We are now fairly inside the Union Lines, and breathe easier. 
Our camp is about a mile below the Ferry, close by the great 
" Fall of the Kanawha ; " at a point where the mountain, reced 
ing from the west bank, leaves a grassy slope between the 
water and the woods, about a mile long, by fifty rods wide. 
Here, it is given out, we are to rest for two or three days. 
" And a rest, a good, genuine rest, will do us any amount ot 
good." 

An incident of our last day s march is perhaps worth trans 
cribing ; as, at the time, it furnished much amusement to the 
lookers-on, and to the chief actor, temporary exemption from 
the fatigues of marching. On our route down the mountains, 
we had been enjoying the scenery, which, at each successive 
step, burst upon the view with ever increasing grandeur. As 
we neared the foot of the mountain, our attention was drawn to 
a squad of fellows, who were chasing a little, wild, but well 
conditioned mule. "Like a flash, it occured to me that the 
animal would look well under a saddle, with a man of my size, 
riding." So, asking the aid of a few friends near, we endeavored 
to surround him ; and after chasing him about a mile, we run 
him in among some Cavalry, when, by a dexterous jump, I 
succeeded in clasping my arms round his neck. Off he started, 
with a loud bray, a whisk of his tail, and a dexterous fling of 



HUNTER S RAID. 323 

his heels, twitching me off my feet, and slinging me among the 
brush, and against the rocks. The whole column was convulsed, 
and laughed, and shouted, until the mule, after dragging me 
some eight or ten rods, finding my weight too much, gave in, 
and I saddled and bridled him." " TJie critter rode extremely 
w ell" 

Of this retreat, Maj. Pratt, who, wounded, rode along with 
Headquarters, and had less privation than would otherwise have 
been his lot, writes thus : 

" Our retreat continued up to yesterday. We were not compelled by the enemy to 
continue it thus far, as he only followed us for four or five days; but we have been 
compelled to march day and night, as fast as our broken-down, wearied men could 
move, to escape starvation. For the greater part of our retreat, we have marched 
through a very thinly settled region, poorly cultivated, and almost entirely destitute 
of provisions. I have 110 heart to write of the sufferings our poor boys have endured : 
and endured with a courage as lofty, and a heroism as sublime as was ever exhibited 
on the field of battle. To increase their sufferings, the weather has been intensely hot 
for the past three weeks; and as we have had no rain till a day or two since, we have 
marched midst clouds of dust, almost suffocating alike to man and beast. Sometimes 
without food for twenty-four, thirty-six, and forty-eight hours, and obliged (at first to 
get away from the enemy, and later, to procure food) to march both night and day, 
with occasional halt, for an hour or two or a time, our men became so worn out, that 
many were unable to keep up with the column. I have several times, after going into 
camp about midnight, seeu men crawling along in, just as the Brigade was moving out, 
at 5 or G o clock the next morning. When making a momentary halt during the night, 
have seen men drop down in the middle of the road, and in an instant, seemingly, be 
in a sound sleep, from which the officers, though striking them with their swords, 
could scarcely rouse them. We had fresh meat nearly every day (killed, hot and 
feverish from the drive), but for the last seven days had nothing in the shape of bread 
but six ounces of flour per man; less than one ounce per day. Since leaving Lyuch- 
burg, have marched rising two hundred miles; have crossed the Alleghany Mountains, 
and numberless others of less note ; have crossed creeks and forded rivers ; have endured 
privations of almost every kind; and have reached the land of promise, or rather a 
region of supplies. Yesterday we had a day of rest in camp, the first for eighteen days. 
Our horses and mules suffered terribly for want of forage and rest, and we lost very 
many. In a single day, when crossing the Alleghanies, I am told, we lost several 
hundred. Our wagons were of course burned. And now, what have we accom 
plished ? We have marched six hundred miles; have fought three pitched battles; got 
whipped at Newmarket; gained a glorious victory at Piedmont; defeated the enemy 
in a fair stand up fight at Lynchburg have destroyed bridges innumerable, and miles 
of railroad tracks ; burnt foundries, mills, public stores; captured many horses, some 
prisoners, and brought away contrabands without number, and I am inclined to think, 
without value, although they have received very much care from Gen. Hunter. On 
the other hand, we have lost in killed, wounded and missing, probably 2,500 men ; 
while from Lynchburg to Gauley Bridge, every rod of our way is marked by burnt 
wagons, dead animals, and abandoned property. I am of opinion, that although this 
is the greatest raid made since the war commenced, it amounts to absolutely 
nothing, beyond its cost. To show you how hungry our poor fellows were, I will give 



324 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

you a little incident. During a shower three or four days ago, and the only one for a 
month, and before our supply trains reached us, I crawled under a wagon to keep dry, 
and while there, a drummer boy came along, and picked up an old bone which must 
have lain there for a long time (the meat upon which was black, hard and dry), and 
commenced to eat of it as though it was the sweetest morsel he ever tasted. I have 
often seen men go to the spot where our cattle were slaughtered, and pick little pieces 
of rlesh from the hides, and from the ground, to satisfy their hunger." 

What may be regarded at home with more repugnance, men poked among the 
excrements of our team animals to get and eat the undigested grain which had been 
voided. 

In a letter to his mother, under date June 30th, Sergeant Major Blake wrote as fol 
lows: " Seven days after leaving Salem we were in the mountains and woods ; not a 
solitary house once in ten miles. We had no bread no meat no nothing. The men 
grew poor and thin. When I looked in a glass for the first time in many days, I was 
startled at the change. You would not have known me, had you seen me. I hardly 
knew myself. My face was black and thin my eyes large and of such queer expres 
sion I They looked as if they would like to eat me up !! " 

All this is past, and to all seeming, forgotten; for in the 
rebound of feeling occasioned by the relief of our wants, the 
camp is noisy with frolicking, laughing men.

July 2d. We started at 5 o clock this morning, marching 
over a good road. The weather was cool, and we made good 
time, having, at 12M., marched 14 miles. After a short rest, 
we got on to our feet again, and having marched seven miles far 
ther, went into camp for the night ; first having received orders 
to move at 2 A. M. to-morrow. The other Brigade has gone on. 

3d. Reveille at 1 1 A.M., and at 2 o clock we were on the road 
to u Piatt," which we reached at about 5. P. M. We found that 
nearly the entire 2d brigade had embarked, and gone on down 
the river. One boat was left, and another arrived soon after we 
did, so that Col. Wells Headquarters, and about three hundred 
of the " Heavys," (5th N. Y. A.) were loaded and pushed off. 

4th. Camp Piatt. The " Gen. Crook and Minnie Roberts " 
were along side, upon our waking this morning, having reached 
here some time during the night. These were loaded and sent 
off at once. During the day, a mail reached us, bringing the 
startling intelligence of the death of Adj t Woods. We cannot 
realize that this is true. Splendid officer, accomplished gentle 
man, and brave and gallant spirit ; his loss will be mourned by 
every man in the Regiment as that of a personal friend ! 
About 4. P. M., tired of waiting for the arrival of other boats, 
eight companies of the 34th were embarked upon the only one 
here, which was immediately sent off. We ran by Charleston, 
without making a stop ; steamed about two miles further on, 
and, as it is impossible to navigate this river in the dark, we 
then tied up to the bank for the night. We left in camp, compa 
nies " A and F," Capt. Elwell commanding (whose commission 
reached him to-day) with orders to take the first transportation 
which offered, and join the main body as soon as possible. 



HUNTER S RAID. 327 

Looking back now from this point of comparative safety, and 
rest, and plenty, it seems a marvel that we are here at all. 
Even before we had fairly started on this raid, our rations were 
well nigh exhausted ; and had the country passed through been 
thickly settled, and well cultivated, which was far from being 
the case, the rapidity of our march was such as to have pre 
vented the collection of supplies. " For four days the regiment 
" marched day and night, never halting more than two hours at 
" any one time. For nine days we had nothing to eat but fresh 
" beef and mutton, and a very little coffee." Nor, when after 
the arrival of our first supply train, an issue of two days 
rations was made, is it any wonder that they were all consumed 
by the men before they went to sleep ? It is difficult to describe 
the entire exhaustion induced by this long privation of food, and 
rest, and sleep. At a halt, men dropped in their places; were 
asleep instantly ; and were roused again only with great diffi 
culty. It would have been ludicrous, had it not been so sad, 
to see men supported by the " touch of the elbow " of a com 
panion, reel as if in the last stages of drunkenness, when, by 
any accident, that supporting touch was momentarily with 
drawn. Seldom was there any occasion for discipline, and 
when there was, it was enforced by the officers of the respective 
regiments. We, especially, were sensitive to any outside inter 
ference in matters of this kind ; and when, one day, Lieut. 
Belser was administering a little well merited reprimand to one 
of his men, he was interrupted by Gen. Sullivan with the 
remark, " tie him up, Lieutenant, or, by G d, I ll tie you up, 
it can t be wondered at that, as a body, our officers resented the 
brutal and unofficer-like interference. 

It could hardly be expected that much of our old time 
splendor should be preserved during this hurried retreat. So 
that the men preserved their pieces in an effective condition 
seemed to be all that could be reasonably asked ; and away up 
here, hid away among the mountains, ragged, dirty, barefoot, 
an order that "Guns must shine" on the inspection, which 
was to come off the next day, caused much merriment. It 
would be idle to deny that, spite of orders to the contrary, there 
were occasional instances of wanton robbery from houses, lying

along our line of march. Generally, the boys showed a com 
mendable discrimination in this work ; and few suffered, save 
those who had given aid and countenance to the enemy. These 
were the ones, however, who were loudest in their complaints 
against the men. A notable instance occurred, at a halt of 
longer duration than ordinarily happened, near Sweet Springs. 
Near by headquarters was one of those large brick mansions 
which, in Virginia, was sure indication of former opulence and 
aristocracy. It offered temptation too strong to be resisted ; 
and was overrun and ransacked by the hungry men, who were 
not over scrupulous in their appropriation." They had been 
supporting life upon " the sweepings of granaries arid mills ; " 
" upon birch bark and clover blossoms ; " upon scraps of raw 
flesh, scraped from round the butcher s block, and, still worse, 
upon undigested grain, picked from the droppings of horses and 
mules. What wonder that now everything edible, including 
preserves, jellies, even pickles, quickly disappeared. For this, 
excuse could be found. But they could n t eat razors, nor look 
ing-glasses, nor Colt s pistols, nor Sharpes rifles, nor silver nor 
plated ware, nor photograph albums ; nor had they any real use 
for the various articles of female apparel, such as bonnets and 
dresses ; nor of household furnishing, such as pillow cases, 
sheets, &c. When, therefore, upon complaint preferred, that 
the men were guilty of robbing this house of articles of this 
description, Lieut. Bacon had satisfied himself of the justice of 
the charge, no one who knew him, and his knightly chivalry, 
will wonder, that he permitted his sympathy for the suffering 
womankind to get the better of his love for his comrades, and 
in his indignation at the outrage, that he should give assur 
ance that the fall force of army discipline should fall upon 
the guilty, if found within our command. Nor will they 
be surprised that upon the inquiry by the elder lady, if he 
did n t " think this was terrible treatment to be given by Union 
" soldiers to a sister of John B. Floyd," the Lieutenant should 
remember that in the eyes of all Unionists^ this same John B. 
Floyd stood personified as the great thief of the country ; and 
consider, on the whole, this appeal to a Union soldier from 
such source, should seem a little incongruous. Spite of this, the 



HUNTER S RAID. 329 

matter was looked into, and, much to the Lieutenant s relief, 
the robbers were not found to be of our brigade. At a later 
hour the A. B. G. visited these ladies, at their request; listened 
to the story of their losses ; sympathized with them in their 
wrongs; lamented with them in their sufferings; and to their 
passionate entreaty to know what it all meant, could only reply, 
"Ladies, it weans war!* Of this same affair, R. C., of F, of 
ours, writes : ki One, of whom this narrative had to do, arrived 
" on the scene, late, but with an excellent appetite, which a 
" quantity of very rich preserves, taken from under some loose 
fc floor boards, where they were carefully stowed away, allayed 
* for a considerable period. He was interrupted by a cry of 
" Fall in! fall in! when every knapsack was thoroughly ran- 
" sacked, and no contraband property of any kind found." 
"And yet," he writes, one of the boys, a day or two after- 
" wards, sold to an officer, for $ : &gt;0, a Colt s rifle, which he hap- 
"pened somehow to have about him." 

tith. There was a heavy fog lying upon the river this morn 
ing ; and from this, or some other cause, it was 7 o clock before 
we swung into the stream, and got fairly underweigh. About 
4 o clock P. M. we reached " Point Pleasant," at the mouth of 
the Ohio: and steaming up this river, stopped at "Pomroy," 
just before sunset. After about a half hour s stay at this place, 
we shoved into the stream again, and continued on our way till 
dark ; when we tied up to the bank for the night. Our band 
favored us with many delightful airs on our run, during the 
day ; and our progress along the river, was hailed with cheers, 
and waving handkerchiefs by the inhabitants of the various 
villages we passed. We passed many coal and salt mines on 
our Avay down the " Kanawha ; " but, owing to the low stage of 
the water, and the high banks of the river, we could see but 
little of the country. 

6th. Started again early this morning. Twice during the 
day, the men had to leave the boat to lighten her sufficiently 
to allow of her passing the sand bars. Just at dark, we reached 
"Blennerhasset s Island," where the boat was to remain over 
night. 

1th. We left the boat at 3 o clock this morning, and took up 



330 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

our ]ine of march, along the Ohio shore, for the Ferry at " Par- 
kersburg." The country passed through, looked finely. Grass 
and grain were ready for harvesting ; cherry trees were loaded 
with fruit, black and tempting. We bought some cherry pies ; 
nice, and large, at ten cents each, a great contrast to prices in 
the Valley; also some nice raspberries, with sugar and cream. 
Reached and crossed the Ferry to " Parkersburg ; " where we 
found a train waiting for us. Here rations were issued ; and we 
got a large mail. " Graf ton Junction " was reached about dusk ; 
soon after which, we settled ourselves, as well as we could, for 
the night, in the old box cars provided for us ; and, at daylight, 
next morning, the 8th, found ourselves entering "Piedmont," 
the scene of the raid of our old friend " McNeil," a short time 
before. A short run carried us to " Cumberland," where we 
found Lieut. Cobb, and several of our wounded, ready to join us. 
We proceeded 011 our way to " Green Spring," where we had to 
haul up, on account of the rebuilding of the railroad bridge, 
which a raiding rebel party had destroyed. This repaired suffi 
ciently for the passage of the train, we ran down to " Cherry Run," 
which we reached soon after dark. Here we passed the night. 

Wi. It is dreadfully hot, this morning. General Sullivan s 
Headquarters have come in to-day ; also Col. Wilde s ; and the 
detachment of the 5th N. Y. Heavies. Thus far, we get no 
news of the " 116th " Ohio, and the two Companies of the 34th, 
with them. Lieut. Cobb has been appointed A. D. C. upon the 
Staff of Acting Brigadier Wells. The river is very low, and 
can be forded anywhere, without difficulty. Maj. Pratt left 
for home, on sick leave ; his wound still very troublesome. 

10/4. We get rumors this morning, which we don t credit, 
however, of the presence of from 25,000 to 30,000 Rebels, in and 
near " Frederick," Maryland ; also, that a party of the 15th 
New York dashed into Martinsburg, this forenoon, and drove 
out the Rebels ; which we rather like to believe is true. Orders 
to march at 3 P. M., were issued, but soon afterwards counter 
manded; the Battery, for which we have been waiting, not 
having arrived. The 116th Ohio, with our two Companies, also 
our Headquarter teams, ambulances, and wagons, have reached 
us ; and we are to march at 4 A. M. to-morrow, as far as Martins- 
burg; distance 13 miles.

\\tli. Reveille again, this time at 3 A. M., and \ve started 
about an liour afterwards. The weather was pleasant, until 
the sun was high, when, it became oppressively hot. At 
u llcdgesville," about seven miles out, AVC arrested, all the 
inhabitants of secesh teudencv, and took them along with us. 

, &lt;~&gt; 

Martinsburg was reached soon after noon, and we Avcnt into 
camp, on the north side of the town. 

13/i. We passed yesterday in camp willingly enough ; 
for the weather was hot, almost beyond endurance. It is the 
same to-day. Notwithstanding, we had orders to hold ourselves 
in. readiness to move, this time for " Harper s Ferry," which is 
pleasant news for us all, as we look upon that place as a sort of 
home. At 4 p. M., we were on our way. As we moved through 
the main streets of Martinsburg, we received glad welcome 
from the people, with whom we had made pleasant acquain 
tance, during our few weeks stay this spring. If anything, the 
boys marched with a prouder air and firmer step, than when 
in earlier days, they moved in parade before the same sympa-

thizing crowd. Marching to Avithin a mile and a half of 
a Duffield Station," we went into camp for the night. 

14th. Breaking camp about four this morning, and passing 
44 Duffield Station," we reached "Bolivar Heights" at about 10 
A. M., where we halted. The Col. and staff rode into the 
Ferry. We were glad enough to meet Capt. Pratt, Lieut. 
Lincoln, and others of our old friends, among whom was Capt. 
George S. Leland, now and for a long time Post Quarter 
Master. If he and the others had come, empty handed, to 
greet us, our pleasure would have been great ; but bringing 
with them, as they did, things good for the stomach, in large 
abundance, our joy was unbounded. Blessings on them! 
May they always feast of the fat of the land! and, what is 
more, may they always have appetites as sharp as ours were ! 
" May they be," in the language of a venerable Darkey minis 
ter among us, " at all times endowed with both appetite and 
capacity." 

About 8 P. M. the command w^as in motion again. As we 
passed 011 through Bolivar and the Ferry, all ran out to greet 
us, and bid us welcome, and good-bye. The day was memorable 
to us, as being the anniversary of our crossing the river and 
occupying the place. Since then, how many have fallen by 
our sides! We crossed the Potomac upon the pontoon bridge, 
and, keeping on through "Sandy Hook," went into camp near 
" Knoxville." 

1.5th. We started again at 6 A. M., marched along the tow 
path of the canal nearly to "Berlin," when, rolling up our 
pants, we forded the Potomac, whose waters. were nearly up to 
our waists. Then, taking a " dirt road " leading into the 
Leesburg pike, we passed through u Lovettsville," where we 
left the pike and moved towards " Hillsboro," going into camp 
within about a quarter of a mile of the village. During the 
afternoon, our advance skirmished with a portion of .Jackson s 
force, and captured about thirty of them ; also one or two 
wagons. We could hear nothing of the whereabouts of the 
main force of the rebels. 

16th. The weather was very warm this morning, and we laid 
quietly in camp, until about noon, when we had orders to move 



HUNTER S RAID. 

immediately. Our brigade took the back track to the Pike, 
and then struck off towards " Waterford" skirmishing occasion 
ally with the enemy, till we reached the town, which the 
Rebels left hurriedly as we entered. Our reception by the 
inhabitants was a warm, and seemingly a hearty one. Our 
halt was for a couple of hours, at the end of which time we 
received information that " Wright," with a portion of the 6th 
corps, was moving on our left. At the same time, came orders 
from " Crook," who had to-day been put in command of the 
1st Division, Army of West Virginia," for us to join him, 
without delay, at " Purcellville." We started struck the Pike 
at " Harmony," about three miles from Leesburg, and readied 
Purcellville about 11 r. M., having inarched twelve miles. Here 
we went into camp. 

18A. We remained in camp all day yesterday, resting and 
recruiting, of which we all stood in much need. "Mulligan and 
Duffie were having a warm time with the Rebels at * Snickers 
Gap, some eight or ten miles from us." 

Reveille was sounded at 3 o clock this morning, and at 4, we 
were on the march. We reached " Snickersville " about 0, and 
rested till 2, when we started on our way through the Gap. As 
we gained the summit, we could see the enemy in force, posted 
across the Shenandoah. We moved to the right, down the 
river, seeking a favorable place to cross. Having reached the 
river, we discovered two regiments of Rebels drawn up on the 
opposite bank. The 34th, leading the advance, pushed boldly 
on, forced the crossing, and forming, drove the enemy, some 
half a mile to the cover ot l some woods; taking one Capt. and 
some twenty privates, prisoners. The 2d brigade followed close 
on our heels, and extended on our right; while still farther in 
that direction was a body of dismounted cavalry. .In the 
distance, columns of dust disclosed the advance of strong 
bodies of the enemy, (Gordon s and Echol s Divisions in our 
front, and Rhodes to the left) which, coming up on our right, 
charged, breaking the line and driving before them the dis- 
comfitted men. Undismayed by this apparent reverse, Col. 
Wells swung his own right, and charging in turn, sent the 
enemy again to the cover of the woods. Our ammunition was 
25 



334 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

getting short, in fact, was nearly exhausted, but we felt that 
we could hold the enemy, in check, till the 6th corps, .now 
ready to cross from the other side, could get up in support. 
But to our surprise and astonishment, we received orders to 
recross the river. This was done in good order, the men 
wading in the water up to their waists, and we went into camp 
again in the Gap. Our regiment had four killed and eleven 
wounded. 

~L9th. We have remained in camp all day, feeling soured 
and chagrined ; and have busied ourselves in speculating upon 
what we cannot help considering the blunder, by which, 
instead of the 6th corps crossing to support us, we were ordered to 
abandon a field, we had already won. We wonder who will 
crave the honor of giving that order ! From the hills, where 
the batteries of the 6th corps were, and still are in position, we 
can easily see the Rebels now at w^ork, gathering their wounded, 
and burying their dead. They also seem to be building barri 
cades along the river bank. Their ambulance trains are in 
motion ; and from the columns of dust rising in the direction of 
Winchester, we are induced to believe their whole army is 
moving. We can hear sharp cannonading towards "Ashby s 
Gap." " Duffie " is out there somewhere. 

20th. Although our orders were to move early this morning, 
we did not leave camp till nearly noon. As we neared the 
river bank, we saw that the crossing was clear, the rebels having 
left. A heavy shower came upon us as we entered the ford, 
and for a half hour it literally poured. We have encamped 
close by our battle ground of the 18th. The sight is sad enough. 
Our poor fellows are lying half buried ; heads and arms protrud 
ing through the slight covering of earth, thrown over them. 
We counted twenty-two graves, of men from one North Caro 
lina Regiment; and there are many others all over the field. 
Heavy and brisk firing, towards night, in the direction of 
Winchester, led us to suppose that " Averill was pounding 
away at Early." 

2~Lst. As we supposed last evening, Averill arid Early had a 
" little mill," with each other, near " Winchester ; " with the 
result that the latter left on the field four twenty pound Par- 



HUNTER S KAID. 335 

rots, three hundred killed and wounded, besides losing some 
2,500 prisoners. Our day has been spent in camp, quietly. 

22c. At five this morning we were roused, with orders to- 
move at 6 o clock. There was quite a bustling, and hurrying, 
as the Boys had somehow come to the conclusion that we 
should remain encamped here, a few days. 

Taking the Pike, and passing through " Berryville," we 
reached " Winchester," about 4 p. M., having marched sixteen 
miles. Passing through the town, we occupied our old camping 
ground, of two months, since. Col. Thoburn, 1st West Virginia, 
is assigned to the command of our Division ; Gen. Crook having 
just received his second star, and assumed command of the 
" forces of this Department in the field." We hear of the rebels, 
as in force, at " Strasburg." We are hoping to be allowed to 
remain here a few days ; long enough at least to enable us to 
draw clothing, of which we all are sadly in need. 

23c?. We went to sleep last night, indulging the hope that 
we might have rest for a few days ; but early this morning a 
scattering fire in our front let us know the vanity of all earthly 
hopes, at least in time of war, with the enemy not "twenty miles 
away." " Fall in ! fall in ! " broke upon our ears, and warned 
us to be ready for the enemy, who, we learned, was approaching 
in force. We marched out about a mile to meet him. Our 
Brigade had the right. After a good deal of manoeuvring 
we were posted in a piece of woods, on the right of the Pike 
Going to work with a will, we soon built a splendid breast- work 
" a la Piedmont," for cover. It formed a strong defence. The 
enemy not advancing, we fell back to our first position, in the 
edge of the town. The Cavalry and Artillery had a lively time 
of it, and the skirmish line of the 2d Brigade was in, for a few 
moments, but did not suffer much. Our shelters are up, and 
we are hoping for, at least, a quiet night. 

24:th. The morning is fine and fair, although the air is filled 
with smoke. About 9, orders came for us to resume our posi 
tion behind the breastworks thrown up by us yesterday. The 
left of the line, which was across the pike, soon became heavily 
engaged, and we were advanced through the woods for nearly 
a mile. The fire on the left grew hotter and hotter, and our 



336 .THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

skirmishers were just getting busy when we were ordered to 
fall back. So back we came, up to and through our breast 
works. As we crossed these, the Rebel line, widely extended, 
could be seen advancing across the country. Their force prov 
ing far superior to ours, a grand retreat was ordered. Our 
brigade did not suffer much, but some of the others lost very 
heavily. We continued in retreat, falling back to the west of 
the town ; then, taking the fields, we struck across for the 
Martin sburg pike. Our train was making rapidly for the 
rear, and we were ordered up as its guard. For miles, every 
thing went well enough. There was heavy fighting in the rear, 
but all was clear in our front. Suddenly, from the flank, a body 
of some 400 or 500 cavalry charged the train. Wells formed in 
line, and scattered them with a volley. But a panic seized the 
teamsters, and for miles it was a perfect route. Order was 
restored after a while, and about dark we reached " Bunker 
Hill," and made our bivouac on the south side of the creek. 
" The behavior of some of the troops engaged to-day has been 
shameful." Among our killed is Gen. Mulligan, commanding 
division. 

25/i. A severe rain storm set in about 12 o clock last night, 
continuing till about 10 this forenoon. How it did .pour! We 
turned out at daylight, wet, cold, tired, sleepy, hungry and 
cross : crossed the creek, formed line of battle, and had a nice 
little skirmish with the Rebel force, which was again pressing 
us. During the whole time, the rain fell in torrents. About 
9 A. M., our brigade, acting as rear guard, commenced to fall 
back. We reached Martinsburg about noon, and again stood 
in line of battle. The Rebels soon appeared, and we became 
engaged. Skirmishing was continued till about 3 P. M., when 
we fell further back, taking a new position on the east side of 
the village, from which after a while we advanced, and in turn, 
drove the enemy through the town, and established our line, at 
sunset, about a mile and a half out on the Winchester Pike. 
About dark, we withdrew on the Williamsport Pike, and 
having reached the Potomac, went into camp, on the banks 
of the river. While the morning s skirmish was going on, a 
plucky incident in the duelling line occurred. A mounted confed- 



HUNTER S RAID. 337 

erate rode out, alone, in front of their line, directly toward ours. 
Instantly a man dashed from among our cavalry to meet him ; 
and as these two got within thirty or forty yards of each other, 
they began to empty their revolvers. The Reb. shot the horse 
from under our man, who regaining our lines, mounted another, 
and went forward again. While these two were firing at each 
other, a second Johnny came riding, under cover of the hill, 
towards these combatants, and got one shot at our man. Seeing 
this fellow, and his object, Sergeant Judd of ours, crawled 
down under cover of some bushes, and let him have a shot. " I 
didn t hit him," said J., "but as he ducked his head down 
under his horse s neck, and galloped away, I guess he thought 
the ball came near enough for comfort."

26th. We started at light this morning, and commenced 
crossing the river. The ford was a very good one indeed. 
Reached " Williamsport," which is quite a pretty little place, 
whose inhabitants are said to be Union ; halted long enough to 
enable everything to be got out of town, when we started, on the 
"Sharpsburg Pike," and kept on till we reached u Boonsboro " 
shortly before sunset. Here we went into camp, hoping for a 
good night s rest ; distance marched, about thirteen miles. 

But about 10, we were roused, and starting out, marched to 
Sharpsburg, which place was reached at 2 o clock the morn 
ing of the 27th. 

27th. We were on the road again at 6 this morning, and 
marching down into the town, halted to draw rations. Then, 
starting again, passing over a part of the " Antietam " battle 
ground, and through Harper s Ferry, and " Sandy Hook," we 
reached "Pleasant Valley," about 4 p. M., where we went into 
camp. We are just nine miles, by the pike, from our last night s 
camp at " Boonsboro ," but to get here we have marched over 
twenty miles of a dusty, weary way. 

2Sth. The day has been very hot. As our night was quiet, 



THE RACE GROUND. 339 

and morning undisturbed, we began to think there could be 
" rest for the weary," but at 5 p. M., orders were received di 
recting us to cross the Potomac; so back we trudged, crossed at 
Harper s Ferry, and are once more encamped at " Halltown." 
We hear the 6th and 19th corps are close behind us, and every 
thing points to another trip up the valley. Well, it can be 
done, I suppose ; but it will come very hard upon us, in our 
exhausted condition. 

29A. For a wonder we remained in camp to-day ; but that 
the boys might not be discontented, a drill was ordered, one 
not laid down in Casey. 

Clothing was to be issued, of which we are all much in need ; 
for we have marched, and slept, and fought, in rain and shine, 
in dust and mud, without change of any single garment since 
we started on our raid last April ; and our clothing is not only 
dirty, but ragged ; and not only ragged, but fairly alive with 
those grey-backs which stick so like brothers, when once 
domiciled in one s clothing. 

Preceded by our band, and followed by Lieut. Lincoln, 
Acting Quartermaster, whose teams were loaded with a 
complete outfit from head to foot for every man in the com 
mand, we were marched to the banks of a small stream, and 
ordered to strip, in as few motions as possible. Standing in 
puris naturalibus, a regiment of naked men, each one grasping 
his piece of soap, the order was given to " charge on the river." 
Such shouting, and yelling, such tumbling and pushing, such 
ducking and splashing, such scrubbing was never before seen. 
Meanwhile our Quartermaster moved up his teams to the line 
of old clothes ; the Captains receipted for the new issue ; and 
the men, as they left the water, their skins sparkling and glow 
ing, were given the new clothing to put on. This done, the 
old clothing was piled and burned; and to the tune of "Oh, 
dear, what can the matter be," we marched back to our 
quarters,, clean and bright, and as ill fitted as the last arrived 
one hundred days men; and for a while we shall feel just as 
well. 

The 6th and the 19th Corps have come up ; and some wags 
among us attempted to pass the Regiment as ninety days men. 



840 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

" Ninety days men is it ! " said an Irishman to whom they 
were telling the story. " Ninety days men, is it ! and faith then, 
a good many of yees have had the nose-bleed, and used your 
old Flag as a towel ! Smoke that, my honeys, till the next 
time ! " 

30/i. Again the night was quiet, and the forenoon undis 
turbed. All were beginning to think something was ivrong, 
when orders came for us " to start, and be lively about it." We 
packed, and started towards Harper s Ferry. The weather was 
very oppressive ; and many of the men " fell out " during the 
march ; some of them completely exhausted by the heat; of whom 
one or two died. Passing through the " Ferry," " Sandy Hook," 
" Reamston," and " Knoxville," we struck the " Frederick Pike," 
which, after following a few miles, we left to the right, and at 
eleven p. M. halted at " Burketsville," having marched fourteen 
miles. We can learn nothing definite, from the citizens, of the 
movements of the rebel force ; hearing rumors only of their 
presence on this side of the river. 

31s. Oppressive as was the weather yesterday, it was worse 
this morning. Our march was resumed at 5 A. M. Our route 
leading us past "Burketsville," through " Middletowii " and 
" Belleville," to within about three miles of " Wolfs burg, "where 
we went into camp. The Boys were entirely overcome by the 
heat of the day, and fell out by scores. So badly were they 
affected, that at the halt for dinner, there were present of the 
34th, but fifteen or twenty to stack arms on the color line. Bad 
as this was, it was worse in some of the other Regiments of 
the Brigade. 

July 31. Our muster rolls show " present," officers, 14 ; 
men, 391; sick, 18. Absent: officers, 9 on detached service; 
sick, 6 ; prisoners of war, 8. Enlisted men : 34 on detached 
service ; without leave, 12 ; sick, 316 , prisoners of war, 105. 
The only changes in position or duty among the officers were 
that Lieut. T. W. Ripley had been appointed Acting Adjutant, 
to date from July 1, vice S. F. Woods, died of wounds received 
in action at Piedmont. Lieut. Lincoln to be Acting Quarter 
master; Lieut. W. L. Cobb to be A. A. I. G. on Brigade Staff, 
and the promotion of Color Sergeant John E. Calligan to be 2d 



THE RACE GROUND. 341 

Lieutenant, vice Walker promoted. 1st Lieut. Charles W. 
Elwell to be Captain. 2d Lieut. R. W. Walker to be 1st Lieu 
tenant, and M. E. Walker and Wm. F. Belser to be 2d Lieu 
tenants. 

August 1st. Turning out this morning at 4J and starting at 
5, we inarched a couple of miles to " Wolfsburg," and went into 
camp. Here we are to await orders from Gen. Hunter, who is 
supposed to be in or near " Frederick City." The burning of 
" Chambersburg," by McCausland, was made known to us, and 
caused no little revengeful feeling. 

3d. We started at 4 o clock this morning, in a slight rain. 
This soon cleared off, leaving us to the rays of a burning sun. 
We reached 4( Frederick City " about 1 o clock, marching 
directly through the place to " Monocacy Bridge ; " then fol 
lowed down the river until we came to the ford used by the 
Rebs, when, a few weeks since, they drove Lew Wallace from his 
position there. Crossing by the same ford, we went into camp 
and pitched our "A" tents ! Heavens, what luxury ! ! 

5th. No movement yesterday ; and the only thing which 
occurred to break the monotony of our situation, was the arrival 
in camp of Capt. Potter, who was just from Massachusetts, and 
who, although his wound is doing well, is not fit for duty, and 
talks some of returning home for a time. His presence was 
made doubly pleasant by the fact that he brought us a mail. 
The weather still continues very, very hot, and we are glad 
enough that we are in camp, instead of on the march. 

Gen. Grant arrived at Gen. Hunter s Headquarters this after 
noon, and there is much speculation as to the actual meaning 
and probable result of his presence. Of course no one was sur 
prised by the sudden call, " to the colors," which was sounded 
about an half hour before sunset, nor for the "order for the entire 
regiment to turn out." Getting under arms, the troops were 
formed on three sides of a hollow square, the fourth side being 
left vacant. For the first time in our service we were to be 
present at a " military execution." The condemned man was a 
member of the 23d Ohio. He originally deserted from the 
Rebel service and enlisted in the 23d. At the battle of "Cloyd s 
Mountain " he deserted this new service, and rejoined the Con- 



342 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

federates, to be captured by his own Regiment, with a musket 
in his hands. On his way to the rear, he escaped from his 
guard and went to Ohio, where, tempted by the offer of $500, 
he entered our service again as a substitute. On reaching the 
front, he was assigned to his old Regiment, and was at once 
recognized by his former comrades. His arrest, trial, sentence 
and execution followed in rapid succession, and was all the work 
of one day. Kneeling on his coffin (the firing detail, about ten 
paces in his front), he was shot through the breast, eight balls 
penetrating his body. . 

6th. Late last eve. we received orders " to march immedi 
ately." These were countermanded in a few moments ; and in 
their place came others directing our movement at four o clock 
this morning. At that hour it was raining quite hard ; but by 
eight A. M. it cleared away. Fording the " Monocacy," we took 
the road leading to Harper s Ferry; passed through u Jefferson " 
about noon, and went into camp near our old position of last 
week, in Pleasant Valley. Although the heat has been 
excessive, the men have borne the day s march very well. We 
learn to-night, that General Sheridan, with his Cavalry, is 
somewhere in our neighborhood. 

9th. Since our arrival here, we have been allowed to remain 

in camp ; the weather then, as since, having been hot, hotter, 

hottest. At our start to-day, we passed through bhe " Hook," 

" The Ferry," and " Bolivar ; " and went into camp, on the 

banks of the " Shenandoah," at Knox s Ford. 

After reaching camp, Lieut. Ripley, and Quartermaster 
Howland, rode back to the Ferry, and passed some enjoyable 
hours. This evening all the officers, of the field and staff, 
have been paid off. All will feel better in consequence, as it 
will be easier getting supplies, if we have some money among us. 
When one has no money, and can t borrow, and is forbidden 
to forage, it is difficult, and sometimes pretty lively work for 
those who sport shoulder straps, to procure subsistence. 

~LQth. We started at four this morning, up the river, in the 
direction of " Berryville ; " keeping between the river, and the 
Charleston Pike, all the way. Marched over our battle ground 
of " Island Ford," and reached " Berryville " about sunset, 



THE RACE GROUND. 343 

going into camp just north of the town. The 19th Corps is just 
to the right of us, and the 6th on their right, holding the 
extreme right of the line. We hear, in the distance, sounds of 
an engagement. 

llth. The weather this morning is pleasant, but the air hot 
and close. Leaving " Berryville " at five o clock, on the " Mill 
wood Pike," we went in the direction of " Front Royal," about 
two miles, and then turned towards "Winchester." There 
were sounds of a smart affair away off on the right. When we 
were within about six miles of " Winchester," we turned again 
and headed in the direction of " Front Royal." We passed 
" White Post," and went into camp opposite, and about six 
miles from " Middietown." There has been heavy skirmishing, 
a good part of the day, by Cavalry, in our front, and by Cavalry 
and Artillery, on our right. 

12/i. Started about six o clock this morning, heading for 
u Middietown ;" where we arrived about noon, halted for 
coffee, then marched out to the creek, where the whole com 
mand was soon engaged in brisk skirmishing, which continued 
all the afternoon. The confederates held their ground, till nearly 
sunset ; when the 1st and 12th Virginia, way down on the left, 
made a brilliant charge, and drove them on a run. This gave 
us the entire bank this side of the creek. In our front, the 
"heavies," deployed as skirmishers, gained and held the farther 
bank ; and we have gone into camp, under cover of the woods, 
near the Ford. 

13t/i. Daylight this morning showed us the enemy still in 
position, but with reduced force. Our Cavalry crossed the 
Creek and the Rebs fell back towards " Strasburg." The 6th 
and 19th Corps also crossed and went into camp on the other 
side of the Creek. The advance had a lively time of it out 
towards "Fisher s Hill." % At sunset the whole force, save the 
skirmishers, who continued to hold the line established last 
night, recrossed the creek. It looks as if we were " in for it " 
to-morrow ; we seeming to be fated to fight on the Sabbath. 
Our own Brigade has laid quietly in camp all day.

Contrary to yesterday s appearances, all has been quiet 
to-day, no movement of importance having occurred. Just 
before sunset, the Rebel skirmish line made an advance, under a 
very brisk fire, driving our skirmishers back a short distance, 
when reinforcements having come up, we, in turn, drove the 
Johnnies ; our reserve, at dusk, occupying a grain field which 
bounds our vision towards " Strasburg ;" and which has been 
alternately held by one or the other party since our first reach 
ing this ground. 

15th. For the past few days the weather has been very hot ; 
to-day was exceedingly oppressive, and the men have been 
thankful enough for the privilege of remaining in camp. Com 
pany drills, for three hours daily, are ordered to be resumed. 
About 2 o clock this afternoon, the Rebels opened upon us with 
artillery, throwing some fifteen or twenty shells, under cover of 
which they advanced their skirmishers. Our line fell back a 
short distance ; when it charged in turn, driving the Rebs back, 
and we again held the stubble field, which had been so often 
contended for. One of our batteries has been posted to-night 
on the left of our camp, in readiness to greet the Johnnies if 
they advance again. 



THE RACE GROUND. 345 

The 170th Ohio left us to-day, their time having expired. 
Advantage was taken of their going, to send back a train under 
their charge. 

16th. It is still very hot weather, and we have laid still dur 
ing the day. Longstreet s Corps, from the direction of the "Luray 
Valley," tried to turn our left, to-day, and in the afternoon we 
heard cannonading, which we learned was near " Front Royal." 
Everything, however, remained quiet in our front. At 8 P. M. 
orders were received to " march immediately, en route for Win 
chester." The 19th Corps was in advance ; next came the 6th, 
and then our own ; Getty s Division, of the 6th Corps, consti 
tuting the rear guard. We reached " Winchester " at about 3 
A. M. where we bivouacked ; distance marched, fifteen miles. 

llth. We were roused at 8 A. M. and were at breakfast, 
when " Fall in," " Fall in," was shouted. We marched through 
town, and out on the " Berry ville Pike," reaching Berryville 
about 3 P. M., where we went into camp. We learned, on 
reaching here, that yesterday s cannonading came from an 
attack made by * Longstreet, upon Sheridan," at " Front Royal ;" 
the former being whipped handsomely, losing some six hun 
dred prisoners and three stands of colors. The prisoners are 
with our column to-day, and look like splendid fighting mate 
rial. Cannonading is now heard in the direction of Winchester, 
\vhere we suppose the 6th Corps to be. Col. Wilson, of the 
123d Ohio, is sick and delirious ; he is now in a stupor in a pri 
vate house near by. 

1.8th. We started at 5 o clock this morning, the column 
heading for " Charlestown." Col. Wilson was better, and we 
took him, with us, in our ambulance. About a mile out, we 
stopped and issued rations to the command, from a supply train. 
Halted about noon, and went into camp, in a very pleasant 
piece of woods, near the scene of the 34th s engagement with 
Imboden in Oct. last. It rained nearly all the forenoon, and is 
now still cloudy. 

19th. In camp all day; weather rainy, ground wet and 
muddy. Red tape has suddenly gained the ascendancy. Orders 
are issued directing the burning of all regimental books and 
papers ; and subordinate officers are notified that, in future, the 



346 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

monthly and tri-monthly returns and reports will be required 
on time. 

20th. Weather still cloudy and threatening more rain. At 
noon, Major Pratt, a large mail, and marching orders, all 
reached us at the same moment. From the Major we learn 
that Col. Lincoln has succeeded in making his escape from the 
.Rebels, and had reached Worcester ; his health very poor, and 
he probably unfit for duty for a long while. The Major him 
self looks much improved by his visit home ; and his wound 
has ceased troubling him, although he is still weak. 

21st. Still cloudy this morning; but about 8 the clouds 
broke away, and the sun burned fiercely down upon his. We 
were engaged in changing the direction of our Brigade line 
this morning, having got Headquarters established, and the 
Pioneers were just pitching the last tent, when sharp cannon 
ading broke out in the direction of Martinsburg, Summit Point 
and Berryville, and orders came to pack up and hold ourselves 
in readiness to move. Marching orders soon followed ; and we 
started off "across lots," coming out about a mile and a half to 
the westward of Charleston. Here we encountered a sharp 
skirmish fire in front. The 1st Division was on our left, and 
the 2d formed on" our right. Far away to the right of these 
was the 6th Corps ; the 19th being between us and the 6th. 
Two lines of barricades reaching for a long distance through 
the woods have been constructed. Skirmishing is quite lively 
in our immediate front, while on the right and far away to the 
left the cannonading is brisk. We have out a very strong 
line of skirmishers, and everything indicates an advance upon 
us, by the enemy in force. 10 p. M. We laid in the woods be 
hind our breastworks of rails, from 3 till now, 10 P. M ; 
when we moved away, taking the back track for Halltown, and 
reaching there about 3 A. M. 

Z2d. We had a rest of about two hours after going into our 
bivouac of last night, or rather this morning, when we fell in 
and marched to the position we are now holding, which is in a 
good piece of woods upon the estate, and near the home of 
Ex-Gov. Lucas, about a mile in front of Halltown. The 19th 
are on our left, and the 6th to our right. Our position is a 



THE RACE GROUND. 847 

splendid one by nature, our line extending from the Potomac 
to the Shenandoah, and we have entrenched ourselves quite 
strongly. Nothing of consequence occurred during the day, 
although the skirmishers in our immediate front were popping 
away quite briskly. About an hour before dusk our Brigade, 
leaving the protection of their works, made a sally and drove 
the enemy back about a mile, killing five, capturing an equal 
number, and getting back without the loss of a man. There 
was a very heavy thunder storm this afternoon. 

*23d. We were up at day break, and in line, prepared for 
and expecting an attack; but none was made. All day long 
the skirmishers have been actively engaged, and occasionally 
a field piece has been called upon, on our side, to bear upon 
the supposed position of the enemy. The Hebels have shown 
no artillery; and have succeeded pretty well in concealing from 
us the position of their men. We have been hard at work, 
forming a new barricade, on our rlank. It is made of heavy 
logs, is very substantial, and we think will prove to be very 
strong. Who should surprise us to-day, by making his appear 
ance in camp, and reporting for duty, but Charlie Tlmrman, 
bugler of D, who deserted at "Upton s Hill/ He lias been to 
Germany, but returned of his own free will, and reporting in 
Boston, was forwarded to us here. 

24/i. Everything this morning was cjuiet, and the weather 
again intensely hot. About noon a reconnoisance in force was 
ordered. We drove the Rebels from their temporary cover, 
(some huge hay stacks, which we fired and burned,) back to 
where their main body was found to be in force, and strongly 
posted. A sharp engagement was had, commencing on the 
right and extending to our own front, in which our brigade cap 
tured eleven of the Johnnies. To-night all along the line, every 
thing is quiet, but it is the quiet which precedes the storm. 
There must be a fight before long, as we have been looking at 
each other long enough.

Aug. 31s. Our muster roll shows with the regiment present 
for duty : Officers, 11 ; enlisted men, 368. On detached service : 
Officers, 9 ; sick, 5 ; prisoners of war, 6 ; Enlisted men on de 
tached service, 34 ; sick, 306 ; prisoners of war, 123. The resig 
nation of Lieut and Acting Reg. Q rm r Levi Lincoln, based 
upon Surgeon s certificate of disability, was accepted; and that 
officer honorably discharged the service. 

To-day was an eventful one to us, in that the Paymaster 
arrived, and settled the little obligation each of us held against 
our Uncle Samuel. The boys are feeling " tiptop " in the 
possession of their " greenbacks." 

Sept. 3c?. Orders to be in readiness to move at 4 o clock this 
morning, reached us yesterday afternoon, Accordingly, we 
turned out about 3:30 A. M., and, moving along the pike, came, 
about noon, in sight of " Berry ville." Here we halted for two 
or three hours, when we took to the road again, moved up close 
to the town, and went into camp. By the time supper was 
ready, we were engaged, skirmishing heavily in front, on the 
Winchester road. The firing was rapid and heavy, and lasted 
till long after dark, but without any material result. A heavy 



THE RACE GROUND. 349 

shower, which broke upon us soon after dark, put an end to the 
firing. 

4th. Skirmishing was resumed early this morning ; our boys, 
being well protected, sustained slight loss. Capt. Thompson 
and the Major each had narrow escapes. Capto Elwell received 
a slight wound in the leg. Before breakfast was finished, orders 
came for the men to " fall in," and move to the left of the line, 
where, upon arriving, they were at once set to work erecting 
breastworks. Here, considerable skirmishing occurred, with 
now and then firing by the artillery. About 70 prisoners and 
one stand of colors were taken from the enemy. Among the 
prisoners was the color bearer of the 18th Mississippi. Towards 
evening we got our tents ["A"] pitched. 

5th. The boys have been hard at work, all day, upon the 
fortifications, along the whole line ; but were interrupted about 
noon, by the Johnnies, who made an advance, with two strong 
lines of skirmishers. Our reserve, which had been concealed in 
the under-brush, charged, and captured between sixty and 
seventy prisoners. Our line of defences is very strong; so 
much so, as to lead us to believe that we shall not be attacked, 
while enjoying its advantage. 

6th. The weather, which changed last evening, when it com 
menced to rain and blow severely, is still rainy, and chilly. 
To-day has been the most disagreeable we have had for months, 
and everybody has been cross and ugly. The Sutler, who has 
just arrived, alone looks smiling. His face beams upon us, 
with all the freshness of a new moon. Everything has been 
quiet in our front. 

Itli. The storm, which has raged for the past twenty-four 
hours, broke last night, and this morning is most beautiful. 
Under the influence of a bright sun, the camp looks, and the 
men are more cheerful. All are engaged in drying blankets and 
clothing, both of which are u ringing wet." Except a slight 
Cavalry affair, down towards " Millwood," everything to-day 
has been quiet ; and it looks as if the enemy had withdrawn 
from our front. 

8th. About nine o clock came marching orders. Packing, 
we started, and crossing the "Charleston Pike," marched 
26 



350 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

along, across the country, in a line with the " Summit Point 
Pike," until about four P. M., when we went into camp near 
"Summit Point," at the extreme right of the line, about half 
way between " Charleston" and u Berry ville." Here we were 
joined by Sergeant Smith, of K, who, having escaped from the 
rebels at u Harrisonburg," had succeeded in making his way to 
our lines at " New Creek." He has had a hard time of it. 

$tli. Our march yesterday was made in a pouring rain, which 
continued till this morning ; since which, we have been favored 
with regular " dog-day " weather ; now, a bright scorching 
sun, now a violent shower, and blowing at intervals a regular 
gale of wind. All is quiet in front. 

10th. The weather, which was unpleasant enough yesterday, 
is a little more so to-day. The morning being very warm and 
pleasant ; raining hard at noon, and clear and bright, though 
chilly in the afternoon, and evening. 

~L~Lth. The weather continues mixed. Everything, in our 
front, continues* quiet ; and we have got nicely settled in our 
present quarters. 

Way off, in the direction of " Bunker Hill," there is the sound 
of a smart engagement; and we think perhaps " Averill is giving 
the rebels a warming." 

12/i. Warm and pleasant weather, for a wonder, all day 
long ; and we are enjoying it and our rest heartily. We are 
kept on the qui vive, however, by the sound of heavy cannon 
ading, which has fallen on our ears from the direction of the 
crossing of the " Opequan," and the " Winchester and Berry- 
ville pike." Torbett is said to have charged the enemy most 
brilliantly, and brought off one entire regiment of South Caro 
linians, consisting of 16 commissioned officers and 147 rank 
and file, with its battle flags. 

13^. Again, rain rain rain ; it has literally poured down 
the wind blowing a perfect hurricane. Everybody has kept snug 
in his quarters, and the entire camp has been dismal enough. 

Sept. ~L4th. The morning was pleasant, but the day has been 
showery. New wall tents have been pitched at headquarters, 
which add much to the convenience, and something to the 
appearance of our encampment. " We get information, to-day, 



THE RACE GROUND. 351 

that commissions have been issued, constituting Sergeants Blake 
and Judd, Lieutenants/ They won t grumble much at this. 

~Lbth. Rainy cloudy ivindy sunshiny loivery still ; 
in fact, there has been all sorts of weather to-day. When the 
sun has shone, it has fairly burned ; when it has rained, it has 
poured, as if the flood gates were opened ; and man, dressed in a 
little brief authority, not to be outdone, has tried his best to 
make our condition uncomfortable, by the issue of general and 
special orders, circulars, &c., which have been poured down upon 
our heads thick and fast. 

~LQth. The weather continues " the same " to-day. There is 
nothing doing along the lines. Not to neglect the opportunities 
afforded by this long-continued inaction, a party of our boys 
went out, this morning, foraging on their own account. They 
came back loaded in more ways than one ; exhibiting outwardly 
a good assortment of cabbages, tomatoes, squashes, potatoes, 
apples, peaches, and, in the line of meat, chickens in a goodly 
number, a large supply of pork, and one turkey buzzard. This 
last, in some unaccountable way, by an inexplicable rule of 
division, was sent up to headquarters. Whatever becomes of 
others, it is morally certain these fellows won t starve. 

17 th. The weather is pleasant to-day, for a wonder. Gen. 
Grant came up as far as Charleston, where he and Sheridan 
had a meeting ; and we are looking for orders to move, it being 
rumored that Sheridan has at length received permission to 
"go in." 



CHAPTER XL. 



THE BATTLE OF " THE OPEQUAN." 

The quiet of the last few days was broken early this 
morning by the movement of the entire army. At 3 A. M. we 
were on the march ; this time towards the position of the Rebel 
army which was in and around Winchester. Writes Capt. 
Soley of the 34th, as follows : " Wilson led his Cavalry from 
the extreme left, near Berryville, by the pike to the Opequan ; 
crossed that stream, and galloping along the gorge, gained the 
Rebel earthworks at its head, where he met and drove back 
Ramseur s Division of Rebel Infantry. The 6th and 19th 
Corps coming up, established themselves in line of battle where 
the plain opened from the head of this gorge. Torbet crossed 
the creek, with his Cavalry, at a point lower down, under orders 
to effect a junction with Averill, who was moving on the 
Martinsburg pike. Crook, marching his command (the Army 
of West Virginia), over a dirt road, reached the Opequan 
about 9 A. M., and was held in reserve on the east bank of the 
creek, immediately in rear of the battle-field. As we moved 
to this position, the boom of artillery, faint at first, but increas 
ing in volume as we advanced, with the muffled roll of small 
arms was distinctly heard. This was from Averill, driving the 
Rebel Cavalry up along the Martinsburg pike, and Merritt 
forcing his crossing of the Opequan. Soon, more distinctly, 
from the direction in which we were moving, came the thunder 
of a heavier cannonading. This was from Wilson attacking 
Ramseur, and the Rebels shelling the 6th and 19th Corps as 
they were moving into position. Now, having reached the 
high ground upon the bank of the creek, we were halted ; arms 
were stacked ; and the men, their appetites well sharpened by 



THE BATTLE OF " THE OPEQUAN." 353 

their march of nine miles, since 3 A. M., were dismissed to boil 
their coffee. All were in high spirits. From our elevated 
ground, we could overlook the scene of conflict, on the other 
side of the stream. The 6th and 19th had attacked with great 
gallantry and vigor, though as yet no decided advantage had 
been secured. 

The battle continued with changing fortune for an hour or 
more, when the enemy charging in force struck our centre, 
between the two corps, and sent it back in some confusion. 
At this point, Upton s Brigade of Russell s division, led by Gen. 
Russell in person, struck the Rebel column of attack in flank, 
and compelled it to fall back. From our eminence we could 
see the whole extent of the field. The country, from the creek 
at our feet, and north of the pike leading from Berryville to 
Winchester, was broken, dotted with occasional corn-fields and 
isolated pieces of wood land, and intersected with occasional 
lines of stone wall. Here the Rebels were formed in line of 
battle. From their rear, extending up to the town of Win 
chester, arid far away on and beyond his right and left, was an 
open plain ; the ground, gently rolling, divided by occasional 
walls, and broken, here and there, by patches of thick timber. 
Over this field a dense cloud of smoke was hanging, which in 
places somewhat obscured OUT* view. Yet we saw, or thought 
we saw, that our force, already engaged, was insufficient 
for the work in hand, and somewhat impatiently waited for 
orders to go in. The sound of battle had grown from an 
irregular skirmish fire, to an uninterrupted roll of musketry, 
mingled with and at times almost drowned by the heavier 
roar of Artillery. The loud cheer of our men was met by the 
sharper wild yell of the enemy, afc he gathered to repel our 
charge, or to attack our lines in turn. The contending forces 
had tried each others strength; each had lost heavily; and 
neither had gained decisive advantage. For the moment the 
musketry fire had somewhat slackened, but the artillery, all 
along the lines, was served furiously. 

Most of us leisurely smoked our pipes, and discussed the 
situation. A young Lieutenant of ours, anxious to add a bar 
to his shoulder straps, impatiently cut down mullein stalks with 



354 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

his sword, and petulantly expressed his fear, that " we should 
have no chance , to-day." "Don t be impatient" replied a 
veteran Captain, measuring like* an Indian, the hour with his 
eye ; there is time enough between now and night, for many a 
brave fellow to lose the number of his mess." And at the very 
instant, from the head of the column, our bugles rang out the 
"assembly," and every man sprang to his place. We crossed 
the creek, and entered the caiioii leading to the field of battle. 
Here we met a steady and strong current of wounded men, and 
stragglers, from the corps already engaged with the enemy. 
Forcing our way through the throng, we emerged from the 
gorge, turned to the right, and passing up an intersecting 
ravine, in rear of the troops which had been engaged, formed 
line on their right, in open ground, partly covered in front, by 
a piece of thick woods. 

Here we encountered the enemy s skirmishers, who were 
feeling their way around the right flank of the 19th corps. A 
lively little affair resulted in our driving the enemy out, and 
back to his main line, which was strongly posted behind stone 
walls, in another tract of timber, which extended to the open 
country beyond. 

Duvall s Division, upon entering the defile, after crossing the 
Opequan, instead of following our route, had gone down the 
creek, to a point farther on our right, forded an intersecting 
stream, waist deep in water, with the purpose of coming up on 
our right, where, as we first felt the enemy, he was revealed in 
considerable strength. 

No advance could be made by us, without exposure, to a flank 
attack; and so, standing with orders to keep ready to charge, 
we waited anxiously for Duvall s approach. Suddenly his well 
known battle cry was heard ; and his men came into view, and 
dashed at the enemy, pushing him with an impetuosity seldom 
equalled, never surpassed. Taking up the cry, we joined in 
the charge. As we advanced, a deep ravine extending to our 
front, separated us (the 34th) from our Division on the left. 
The ground in our front, was broken and rough, with here and 
there a tract of wood-land, in which the enemy lay sheltered. 
Delivering our fire with coolness and precision, we pressed 
forward steadily, and swept him into the open fields beyond. 



THE BATTLE OF "THE OPEQTJAX." 355 

These were crossed by stone Avails, running in various direc 
tions, where the ground, although generally smooth, was broken 
by gently swelling knolls. As we gained the summit of one of 
these little knolls, we found, that our line of direction, being too 
much to the right, presented our left flank to the enemy s 
Artillery, which had taken position in " the open," about three- 
fourths of a mile from us. Changing direction by a " a left half 
wheel," in line, we moved directly upon the guns. Duvall s 
line, traced by his waving battle flags only, his men completely 
hidden from view by the young wood, was soon seen, as it made 
its way through a large tract of wood-land, on our right. He 
had doubled back the rebel left, which, emerging from the 
brush, was hurrying to the shelter of a stone wall, in our own 
front. The enemy, well to our left also, were seeking the cover 
of the same wall, which extended, in that direction, to a con 
siderable distance. 

Our own Division had not yet issued from the woods, which 
here projected more to the front ; but Ave could mark its advance 
by the prolonged cries, and cheers it ahvays uttered during a 
charge, or Avhile driving an enemy. 

Now, in our immediate front, was a Avide extended field, 
sloping gradually aAvay for about five hundred yards ; thence 
rising somewhat abruptly to a point about two hundred yards 
farther to the front, Avhence it continued 011 a dead level to the 
Avail, behind which, by this time, the enemy had gathered in 
strong force. Over this ground, under a storm of shells from 
the rebel guns, well posted in our front, the 34th, isolated, 
alone, was advanced in perfect line. Duvall, on our right, 
and at least one-fourth of a mile to the rear, was urging his 
men through the tangled brush-wood ; and to our left, our own 
Brigade, and Division, just issuing from the woods, was engaged 
in rectifying its broken formation. 

It would have been the part of wisdom, had the 34th been 
halted in the slight depression of ground, which it had to pass 
over, where we should have been someAvhat sheltered from the 
enemy s fire. But, ambitious to be the first to plant our stand 
ards on the wall, behind which the enemy Avas posted, we went 
right on. As we reached the crest of the slope, up which we 



356 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

were moving, and brought the wall, less than 200 yards distant, 
into clear view, a vivid sheet of fire, like the burning, blinding 
lightning s glare, ran along the front, and a deadly storm of 
grape arid bullets tore through our ranks. It seemed as if half 
the regiment went down before that single volley. Instantane 
ously the mournful wail of our bugles sounded " Lie down ! lie 
down?" But the order was a mockery. Every man, living or 
dying, was already buried in the grass, which the enemy s mus 
ketry was mowing closely and clean. But for the white flag, 
which, planted firmly, was waving above our lines, neither 
friend nor foe would have suspected our presence. The moment 
and the situation were critical. 

We were not only alone, in advance of any other body of 
troops in Sheridan s whole line of battle, but the ground we 
occupied was swept by grape and cannister from four Napoleons 
hidden behind the wall in our front ; white a battery of rilled 
gunSj further to the Rebel rear, and more to our right, dropped 
its shells, thick and fast, into our line. A shell from one of 
these guns struck the knapsack of a man near me, and sent its 
contents flying in the air. The brave fellow looked up, and 
smilingly remarked to his comrades, " That was a close shave, 
boys ; " and as he ceased, another shell struck him full in the 
face, and, exploding, scattered his quivering flesh over his com 
rades lying near. The Captain of the company on my left was 
struck by a fragment of the same shell. What was to be done ? 
To remain as we were seemed impossible ; to advance or retreat 
seemed equally out of the question. Never, even on " general 
review" did time drag so slowly, or moments seem so dilatory. 
It seemed an age in realit} r , it was nearly half an hour when 
Duvall s men came up. Their advance led the enemy to turn 
his guns partially upon that command. Now, in the partial 
slackening of the fire which had so galled us, "Forward! " was 
sounded from our bugles. All sprang to their feet, and turned 
their eyes to our centre ; for, in the din of the contest, the notes 
were indistinctly heard ; and we (certainly I, for one,) deemed 
it hardly possible that such an order could have been given. 
But there, by the side of our flag, stood the slight form of our 
brave commander (Maj. Pratt), and near to him was our chief 



THE BATTLE OF " THE OPEQUAN." 357 

bugler, who, in response to the former s signal, again bleio his 
shrill blast. There had been no mistake ! It ivas, "Forward" 
We made a dash for the wall, which the enemy abandoned with 
a haste proportionate to our advance, leaving behind him one 
of his Napoleons, and a few of his men. In the dash, and as 
we had almost gained the wall, fell Capt. Thompson, of D, 
pierced through the heart with a musket ball. Brave and 
accomplished officer that he was, his loss dampened the joy of 
our success ! 

Our own brigade and division coming up now, connected on 
our left ; and the enemy fell back to some old rifle pits and 
earthworks, which run parallel with his lately abandoned line. 
From our cover, behind the wall, we could look about us. 
Away to the right Ouster, and Torbett, and Merritt, and 
Averill were driving the Rebel Cavalry, in a confused mass, 
across the open country ; to the left, the 6th and 19th corps 
presented a splendid appearance, as issuing from the woods, 
they pressed hard upon the Rebel force with which they had 
been engaged, now falling back broken and disordered. With 
the coming up of these corps, the whole army moved in magnifi 
cent array ; our own Division directly upon several pieces of 
artillery, which had hurriedly taken position in an old earth- 
Avork, on the heights, near Winchester. The fire from these 
pieces was terribly annoying and destructive. On duty at 
Division Headquarters, and riding near the person of the 
Division Commander, was Parker, bugler of our company u I." 
A shell from one of those pieces struck his horse full in the 
shoulder, and exploding, sent the body of the bugler high in 
the air, and scattered the flesh of the animal in every direction. 
Seeing the mischief, a Lieutenant of Dupont s battery brought 
one of \aspieces, on a gallop, to the front, unlimbered sighted 
it himself, and fired sending up a thick cloud of dust from in 
front of the Rebel cannon. We had no more trouble from that 
quarter. As we advanced against the rifle pits, the enemy 
gave us a feeble and irregular fire, turned in disorder, and a 
cloud of eddying dust, stirred up by his flying masses, as they 
hastily retreated over the plain, told us the day was won. Now 
the Cavalry, in one unbroken line, swept down from the right, 



358 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

and wheeling, gathered within its circle huge masses of the 
flying Rebels. We ceased firing to gaze admiringly upon the 
scene ; this final movement which brought a most brilliant vic 
tory to our arms, and sent Early "whirling through Winchester." 
Following this movement closely, Crook s command, moving 
by the left flank, entered the town, as the enemy s rear issued 
from it, upon the other side. It was twilight; the principal 
streets of the village were choked with the stragglers, and the . 
debris of the defeated and flying enemy. An ammunition 
wagon struck and exploded, with all its horses dead, obstructed 
our passage. All the houses, save such as were already taken 
for hospital use, were closed ; and looked as if abandoned. Not 
a citizen could be seen on the streets; and we moved onward 
with saddened hearts, yet firm tread, out, beyond the town, 
some two or three miles, going into bivouac near Millwood. 

"Sad enough," adds Capt. Soley, "were my feelings that 
night, as I stood bare headed before my company. Twenty-one 
of my men, who advanced against the enemy that day, were 
absent. I could account for each man of them ; they were lying 
on the bloody field; the greater number of them in front of the 
stone wall." &gt; 

Col Wells, commanding brigade, thus writes : " The officers 
and men of the different commands behaved magnificently. Maj. 
Pratt, commanding the 34th Massachusetts, and Lieut. Col. 
Wilds, the 116th Ohio, handled their regiments with great 
courage and skill, and in all the confusion of the charge, kept 
their commands together. I desire to call special attention to 
the gallant conduct of Maj. Pratt and his regiment, in the last 
charge. Capt. Chamberlain, commanding the 123d Ohio, lost 
three of his five officers; and his men became in consequence 
disorganized. But with the portion of the regiment he kept with 
him, he did splendid fighting, and was one of the first in the 
enemy s works. To my own staff, Lieuts. Dissoway and Cobb, 
I am under great obligations for their invaluable assistance. In 
the first charge, some young officer, of Gen. Sheridan s staff, 
rode in advance of the line bare headed, and cheering on the 
men. I regret that I am not able to give the name of this 
officer, whose gallant example helped much in inspiriting the 
men." 



THE BATTLE OF " THE OPEQUAN." 359 

" I have to regret the death of Capt. Thompson, for a long 
time commanding the 34th Massachusetts, and a most valuable 
and gallant officer. (I have the honor to forward a list of 
casualties, and the reports of Regimental Commanders.)

CHAPTER XLI. 



THE BATTLE OF THE OPEQUAN. 

COL. HARRIS AND CAPT. SOLEY CAPT. EL WELL HOSPITAL 
STEWARD, FAIRBANKS DR. SMITH. 

One or two incidents of the day are well worth recounting. 
While we were advancing over the slope, which extended 
between our line and the stone wall behind which the enemy 
had taken his new position, a tall, fine looking officer, mounted 
on a large sized and powerful bay horse, galloped up on our 
left. Swinging /wildly a dragoon s sabre, he exhorted, us in a 
voice which could be plainly heard above the roar of battle, to 
move faster, double quick, run! As he rode down the line, 
looking the very demon of battle, he was recognized as a 
Colonel of a Western regiment, (Col. Harris, of the West Vir 
ginia Infantry), now commanding a Brigade in our division. 
He had strayed from his own command, in his effort to follow it 
while charging through the thick undergrowth of the woods, 
and, in the excitement of the occasion, had mistaken the 34th 
for one of his own regiments. As he galloped along our line, 
which, in disregard of his oft repeated orders, still moved at 
quick time, he thus addressed the writer : " Captain, take the 
double quick double quick, march!" " Colonel," I replied, 
pointing with my sword towards the centre, " those colors are 
my guide ; when they move at a double quick, my men will do 
the same ; if you wish this regiment to move faster, you will 
find its commander in his place, and any order from him will 
be cheerfully and promptly obeyed." 

The Colonel s eyes followed the direction in which my sword 
was pointed ; and as they fell upon the tattered folds of the old 
White Flag of our State (the only one in Crook s entire com- 



THE BATTLE OF THE OPEQTJAX. 361 

maiid), lie saw his error, and, wheeling his horse, and giving 
him the spur, he dashed, under a perfect storm of shot and 
shells, to his own command, on the left. 

A few days afterwards, writes Capt. Soley, I had the honor 
of meeting this Colonel, at Division Headquarters ; and, at his 
request, related the incident ; which, as told, caused much mer 
riment at his (the Colonel s) expense. "Kever mind, Colonel," 
said the Division Commander ; " never mind ; you ve no reason 
" to be ashamed of that adventure ; you were nearer the enemy, 
" and more exposed, than you would have been if you had kept 
" with your own brigade ! " and in the laugh that followed, no 
one joined more heartily than the Colonel himself, who was 
both a brave and meritorious officer. 

Capt. El well relates this, as a part of his experience of the 
day: 

Just previous to the first charge of Crook s command, directly 
in the path of my Company, stood a clump of trees, with thick 
undergrowth of small brush. In passing this obstruction, I 
discovered, closely stowed in an old cellar hole, a party of 
skulkers from the fight. To my demand what they were doing 
there, I received the reply that " we were put here to guard 
these rebels." As none of the party obeyed my order to come 
out, I called Sergeant Hayden and a file of men to my side, and 
ordered them to " fire into the hole." " Hold on Capt. ! don t 
shoot ! " broke from the party, as they tumbled over one another 
in their haste to get away from the direction of the muskets. 
They were a vile set of fellows to look at ; and I am sorry to 
say the Blue Jackets outnumbered the Grey Backs. Selecting 
two of the most sickly ones of our Army, as guard over the 
rebels who were ordered to the rear, I formed the remaining 
ones into a platoon, and marched them forward, as a much needed 
reinforcement to my own company. Being closely watched, 
they joined in the charge which was soon ordered. But they 
could not overcome their repugnance to a fight, and in a short 
time, every mother s son of them had succeeded in getting away. 

Poor fellows ! I wonder how many of them are drawing 
pensions for disability contracted in the service ! ! 

And again, this : At one of those movements when, while at 



362 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

a halt, we were under a sharp fire from the rebels, but a short 
distance in our front, I heard and almost felt, the zip and dull 
thud of a Minni^ ball, which struck Hines of my Company in 
the groin, passed directly through his body, and lodged in the 
groin of his rear rank man, Burnham. Both fell without a 
word or a groan; both laid still, as if dead, for a few moments; 
when Burnham attempted to crawl away on his hands and 
knees. Sending a man to his aid, I moved up to, and laid down 
by the side of Hines. The whole line was down in obedience 
to such order. As I laid my hand upon his head, Hines opened 
his eyes, and recognized me. "I m kilt, Captain! clean kilt 
entirely ! take care of my money, please." I took it from his 
pocket, counted it, arid told him the amount. " Yes, Captain ! 
I know! fourteen dollars," and closing his eyes again, he laid 
still, quiet and peaceful as a child ; not a cry, not a groan 
escaped him. I had in my pocket a flask, with perhaps a half 
pint of whisky, which, knowing what work was before us, I had 
kept for some occasion like this. How I did hate to spare it ! 
not that then I actually needed it, but that I never was more 
dry ; and hardly ever would a drop have tasted better ! But 
like a hero, I rose to the occasion , and with the spirit of a 
martyr, devoted it to Hines. Child-like, he sucked till he drew 
the last drop ; and with a fervent " God bless you, Captain ! " 
and a smile like a cherub, laid back, to all appearance indifferent 
to all earthly things. No cheer of comrade, no yell of defiant 
foe disturbed him ; 

" But he lay like a warrior taking his rest," 
With the roar of the battle around him. 

I don t know how long he remained thus quiet and peaceful; 
but it seemed a long while, when, with no previous warning, he 
writhed and twisted in convulsive agony, and gave utterance 
to the most unearthly cries and groans. I tried to pacify him ; 
telling him that he would exhaust himself, and that his cries 
would have a bad effect upon his comrades. I might as well 
have talked to a dead man. He would not be quieted ; but, in 
the most heart-rending tones begged me to put him out of his 
misery ! " I ve been a good soldier, Capt. ! have nt I ? " " Yes, 



THE BATTLE OF THE OPEQUAN. 363 

Hines ! " "Arid never asked a favor." " No, Hines! " " Then 
Capt., dear ! do me a favor now, and God forever bless you ! " 

" Take your pistol, Capt. ! and for the love of the holy mother, 
blow out my brains. 

The Bugles blew loud and shrilly the order to charge ; and I 
had time only to lay him upon a blanket, which was stretched 
over a couple of muskets, and send him to the rear. I never 
saw him afterwards, as he died that night ; but those yells of his 
ring upon my ears, at this distance of time, as loud, and pierc 
ing, as when uttered on the plains of Winchester. 

What a difference in the characters of these two men, killed 
by this one bullet ! Hines, a rough, coarse, uneducated Irish 
man, with a keener nose for whisky than any other man living. 
When we had no reason to believe there was any liquor within 
miles of the camp, Hines, if off duty, would slink away, and 
soon return, full to running over. On all such occasions, he 
was insubordinate, and quarrelsome ; resisting all authority but 
my own ; though submitting instantly, and without a murmur, t&lt; &gt; 
the slightest word of mine. On duty, he was -as true as steel ! 
unyielding, as a rock, in any position of trust ! He had no feel 
ing of fear. In battle, comprehending that there was rare sport 
to be had, he took good care that he had his fair share. Peace 
to his ashes ! His body lies among the unknown dead which 
make the soil of Virginia holy ground ! The money, taken 
from his body, was paid over to the first Paymaster who 
reached us, after he was killed. With no known relatives, this 
money, with his wages, and well earned bounty, is still in the 
keeping of the Government. 

Burnham was gentle, kind, and affectionate in manner; scru 
pulous in doing his exact duty at all times ; honest to the last 
degree ; obedient and respectful to his superiors in rank, and 
gentlemanly with his associates, and comrades. He lived, in 
truth, the very model of a brave, conscientious, educated New 
England soldier ; and died true hero, and noble patriot. 

Writes Hospital Steward, Fairbanks, thus : " It was the night 
after the battle of Winchester. While going about my duties, 
I came upon the officers of an Ohio regiment, and catching the 
words 34th Massachusetts, could but stop to learn what was 



364 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

said. They were recalling the incidents of the battlefield, and 
the encomiums paid to the men of the regiment were as unex 
pected as they were dear. " Did you ever," asked one, of 
another, " see such a regiment as the 84th ? How they went 
" up that hill, and over that wall, and charged the enemy alone, 
" with no other body of troops to support them ! The d 1 
" himself could not have withstood them." " That s so," was 
the reply ; " and I" do n t believe there s another regiment in 
" the whole army that could have done it." 

And Dr. Smith tells a good one which, though the scene of it 
was at New Market, when some of our army hurried away from 
the field with a speed comparable only with the rapidity with 
which large bodies of the rebels made haste to get away to-day, 
is too good to be lost. 

Soon after the fighting began, an 18th Connecticut man came 
running to the rear, as if Satan was after him. I ran up to him 
to turn him back; and just as I had stopped him, Maj. Pratt 
galloped up, pistol in hand, and, presenting it to the man s head, 
ordered him to join the ranks in front. The man gave a look 
at the Major s pistol, turned, and threw a glance at the enemy 
who were fast coming up with their hideous yell, and gasping 
out ic Good God ! do you suppose, I am going to stop the whole 
Southern Confedracy when it is after me ! " continued his flight 
toward the North and safety. This was too much for the 
gravity of the two officers, and neither of them offered any 
further hindrance to the man s hurried flight. 

Capt. Thompson was buried by his men on the field where he 
fell. Later, his brother, from Maine, came for his body. Having 
carefully exhumed it, he was on his way to the rear, when 
he fell into the hands of Mosby, and was liberated only by the 
sacrifice of all his money, and most of his clothing. And now 
Mosby is honored by being chosen to represent abroad the 
Government he would have destroyed ! 



CHAPTER XLII. 



BATTLE OF FISHER S HILL. 

LOSSES DEATH OF MAJ. PRATT MARCH TO HARRISONBURG 

DUTY THERE DOWN THE VALLEY CAMP AT 

CEDAR CREEK. 

Sept. 22d. We have again met the enemy, and again been 
victorious ; turning him from his entrenchments, as the plough 
turns the land slice in its furrow; and sending him, discom 
fited, and in confusion, up the Valley. 

Marching orders reached us, in our encampment, on the 
morning of the 20th. Our route was up the Valley, in pursuit 
of the Rebel army; on the heels of which, our cavalry was 
supposed to be hanging. With occasional halts, we reached 
" Cedar Creek," where we bivouacked. Resuming our march 
at an early hour the next morning, we soon reached Strasburg, 
where we formed on the left of the line already occupied by the 
6th and 19th corps. Early held "Fisher s Hill," a place of 
great natural strength. Here he had entrenched himself ; and 
by a line of rifle pits, and heavy earthworks, which extended 
from the Shenandoah River, on his right, to the North Moun 
tain, on his left, a distance of some five miles, had rendered his 
position almost impregnable. The hill itself, as it rises above 
" Tumbling Run," a small brook which crosses the Valley pike 
at its base, about two miles south of Strasburg, presents a face 
as difficult to scale as the walls of a precipice. It can be 
approached from the north or eastern side by the Valley pike 
only, which, running along the narrow river bottom, is hemmed 
in on one side by Flint s Hill, so-called, and on the other by the 
Shenandoah River. The pike is exposed, for a long distance, to a 



366 THIRTY-FOUilTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

raking fire from the guns in position on the hill. From the 
high bluff, at the point where Tumbling run, is spanned by a 
stone-arched bridge, a handful of determined men might with 
rocks, loosened and rolled from the summit, hold an army at 
bay. It was literally unassailable in front. Most of the day of 
the 21st, therefore, was occupied by the 6th and 19th corps in 
manoeuvring, as it might be, for position ; driving in the ene 
my s skirmishers, and securing the high land which rose on the 
eastern side of the run, some distance in front of the Rebel 
stronghold. While this was being done, Crook s command, the 
Army of West Virginia, was moving, well to the rear, so as to 
be screened from observation by the enemy, from its position on 
the extreme left, to the base of the North Mountain, on the right. 
Reaching this, it was to continue its march, still keeping under 
cover of the woods on the mountain, till it had gained the 
enemy s flank and rear, when it was to assault and carry the 
works. The movement, so carefully planned and so boldly 
undertaken, was as successfully accomplished. The 2d division 
having passed, undiscovered, beyond the works occupied by the 
enemy, the whole line was faced to the front, and ordered to 
charge. Moving down, at a double quick, with loud cheers, 
our advance was upon the enemy before he had fully recovered 
from his surprise. " Had the heavens opened, and we been 
" seen descending from the clouds, no greater consternation 
" would have been created." 

" We ran over a line of Avorks, upon which he was even then 
at work ; passed on about a quarter of a mile, through the 
woods, -overcoming all opposition, and came out at the foot of 
an almost open slope, on the crest of which, and directly in our 
front, was a double line of strong earth works, filled with men, 
and in an angle of which was a rifled gun. Nothing daunted 
by the sight, each man yelled, if possible, louder than before ; 
and the men of each Regiment dashed forward, ambitious to 
plant their own colors first on the works. The cannon was 
fired, at less distance than one hundred yards, into the 116th 
Ohio ; but its men rushed on, capturing the piece in the very 
smoke of its discharge. The 34th Mass, planted its Flag, first 
of all, upon the parapet of these works ; but the men of the 



FISHER S HILL. 367 

other commands were only a second behind. Halting here a 
moment to gain breath, and reform our lines, we pushed on for 
the next hill, from which the enemy was playing upon us with 
their artillery. From this point, the fighting was mostly in the 
woods. A succession of hills, with abrupt sides, separated from 
each other by valleys of considerable depth, extended to the 
railroad nearer the pike. The enemy s line ran directly across 
these hills ; and on each ridge was artillery, which had full play 
on us as we advanced. The enemy, from each crest, met us 
with a rapid and heavy fire of musketry and artillery ; our 
advance would be checked ; men would come up ; and the bat 
tle would stand still and increase, until our line, sufficiently 
strengthened, would rush on, drive the enemy to the next crest, 
where the same effort would be repeated, with the same result. 
Upon all the eminences we found artillery hot and smoking: 
some, indeed, loaded to the muzzle with grape and cannister, 
but abandoned, undischarged, before the impetuosity of our 
advance. The men of the 2d Division, who had turned the 
Hank, and gained the rear of the line of earthworks, could be 
heard cheering as they swept down behind the enemy s position. 
As the last ridge before reaching the railroad was reached, the 
men of the 6th Corps were seen coming in. Here there was a 
sharp contest, but it was soon over. Crossing the railroad we 
advanced up the right side of the pike, and in conjunction with 
the men of the 6th Corps on the left, and a portion of the 2d 
Division on the right, drove the enemy from his last hold on 
the ridge, and the day s work was done." 

Thirty pieces of artillery, 1,100 prisoners, a large amount of 
ammunition, besides caissons, limbers, ambulances, army wag- 
ons^ small arms, intrenching tools, all in great number, were 
taken. 

The charge, from first to last, must have covered over a dis 
tance of more than five miles. This entire distance was passed 
over under a continuous fire, sometimes very severe ; the men, 
much of the time, on the double quick. In five minutes after 
coming out of the woods, the 34th Mass, had its men together, 
and was marching forward in line, as regularly as on parade ; 
and when the last intrenchment was won, and the day s fight- 



368 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

ing was over, the Regiment was supporting not only its own 
colors, but those of many of the other Infantry organizations. 

It was in reference to this, that the commanding officer of a 
Western Regiment, marked more for its brave daring than for 
its drill or discipline, asked : " How happens it, Colonel, that in 
"all the battles of this campaign, I have never seen the 34th in 
" disorder ! but on the contrary, whether advancing or retreat- 
" ing, your Regiment has always preserved its formation ; and 
" standing or moving, has been always closed upon its colors." 

Writes Col. Wells : " I cannot speak too highly of the 
extreme gallantry of the officers and men of the Brigade. So 
far as this Brigade is concerned, I feel that the success is due, 
more than in any other battle I know of, to the individual hero 
ism of the men in the ranks. The field was so vast, and the 
confusion so great, that the officers could do little but encour 
age their men, and set them examples of energetic courage." 

The official list of casualties in the Brigade, is as follows : 

TROOPS. KILLED. WOUNDED. 

Officers. Privates. Officers. Privates.

Total ....... 1 .. 37 

An accident, which happened after the day s work was done, 
threw a gloom over the entire Corps, of which the 34th was 
part. As the officers gathered to exchange congratulations 
upon the success of the day, a stack of arms, on the line of the 
5th N.Y. Heavy Artillery, from some unknown cause, fell, caus 
ing one piece to be discharged, the ball from which struck Maj. 
H. W. Pratt, commanding the 34th, passing through both of 
his legs, causing his death a day or two afterwards. Thus the 
service lost a gallant and tried officer, and the command a bold 
leader and steadfast friend, of whom Col. Wells writes : " I do 
not review a more gallant or efficient officer." 



FISHER S HILL. 369 

We were occupied the next day in caring for the wounded, 
burying the dead, and gathering up the trophies of the battle. 
Meanwhile the Cavalry and the 6th and 19th Corps sharply 
pursued the enemy. 

Our work having been accomplished, at 10 A. M. of the 24th, 
we resumed our inarch, passing through Woodstock, Edinboro, 
and Mount Jackson, and going into camp about two miles 
beyond. Day s march, twenty-seven miles. The next morning 
we Avent on through Newmarket, passing near the field of our 
disastrous fight of last May, and stopping to look at the traces 
of the battle, still plainly to be seen on the fences and trees. 
Reaching Harrisonburg, the Regiment was detailed as Provost 
Guard. Our stay was pleasant, as the duty was light. The 
time was improved in making out returns, completing our rolls, 
and straightening matters generally. On the sixth of October, 
we broke camp, and started on our way down the Valley. Our 
Brigade formed the rear of the Infantry. Behind us was the 
Cavalry, which was engaged in devastating the country round 
about. Every barn, mill, foundry, every wheat stack and hay 
rick was destroyed ; even standing corn was cut, piled and 
burned; and all cattle, sheep and swine driven before us. 
Huge clouds of smoke, extending as far as the eye could reach 
to the rear, and upon each flank, attested to the thoroughness 
with which this work was done. 

On the llth, " Cedar Creek " was reached; and we went into 
camp on its east bank, occupying a line between the Shenan- 
doah and the Pike, at which point we connected with the 19th 
Corps, Avhich in turn connected with the 6th, the extreme right 
of the line being held by the Cavalry. The line was made to 
conform, at all points, with the topography of the country, all 
the natural advantages of which were made available. With 
our front fortified, we rested confidently, in the strength of our 
position. 

On the 12th, a portion of Gen. Crook s command, consisting 
of the 5th N. Y. Heavy Artillery, llth and 15th Va. Infantry, 
the whole under Col. Harris, an officer of acknowledged mili 
tary skill and self possession, were despatched on a reconnoi-

sance towards Strasburg, with a view of learning, if possible, 
the position of the Rebel army, This party advanced cau 
tiously to a hill, from which Strasburg and its surrounding 
country could be observed. The village was found to be unoc 
cupied by any but its own citizens. A few Cavalry videttes 
were seen beyond the town ; but close scrutiny, through field 
glasses and telescopes, failed to discover any signs of the pres 
ence of the enemy, and our party returned to camp, satisfied 
that no considerable hostile force could be in the vicinity.

PROMOTION CAPT. ELWELI/S LETTER. 

With a knowledge of the result of this reconnoisance, what 
was our surprise, just as our dinner call sounded on the next 
day, to have a shell fired, from 110 one could tell where, drop 
in our camp, near to Headquarters mess table. There was 
no consternation ; but a lightning flash in. the broad glare 
of a mid-day sun could not have caused more astonishment. 
Another soon came. This time, a puff of smoke from the piece 
betrayed its situation, but no one dreamed of the presence of 
more than a small reoomioitering party. Writes an officer of 
ours, present at the time, and who took part in the engagement 
which followed : "About noon, might have been seen five pairs 
of heels protruding from a shelter tent near the centre of the 
line of the 34th, the owners of which were deeply engaged in a 
game of cards, although an indifferent spectator might have 
supposed from their position, that they were trying to swim on 
dry land. The bugles had just sounded the call to dinner. 
Boom I Boom ! suddenly broke upon our ears. Hallo, says 
one, there goes a salute ! we must have been licking the grey- 
backs again! Boom! Boom! this time accompanied by the 
whizzing of a shell which struck the ground mid-way between 
the tents, and Regimental Headquarters. Nice kind of a salute 
that, thought we, as scrambling out, we got on to our feet, and 
looked round to see what it all meant. The men of the regi 
ment next us, were straggling through our camp, bearing with 
them knapsacks and blankets, half eaten hard tack, and half 
cooked coffee in their camp kettles. Sure enough, it was a 
strange kind of salute ! The Rebels were popping away at us, 



372 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

from a hill 011 the other side of the creek, and had our range as 
accurately as if they had been engaged for a long time, instead 
of but a few minutes. The assembly was sounded at once ; and 
without waiting to finish our game, we took our respective 
positions in line. Orders came to us to move out, and ascertain 
the strength of the enemy. The 1st brigade, (ours) Col. Wells, 
was already under arms on the left of the] Pike. The 2d, Col. 
Harris, 10th West Virginia, was ordered to move on the right. 
In our front, and between us and the creek, there was a piece 
of low open ground, about two hundred yards wide, which 
must be crossed. 

The Rebels concentrated their fire upon this ground as we 
moved over it, but the old Regiment had seen too much hot 
work during the summer to flinch at such a time, and marching 
steadily on, crossed the creek, and advanced in line toward the 
Rebel batteries. To all appearance, a couple of batteries only, 
with a small supporting force of infantry, were posted on the 
eminence between Cedar Creek and Strasburg; their line, 
partly concealed by woods, crossing the hill at right angles to 
the Pike. Against the force thus partially screened from obser 
vation, these two Brigades advanced in line, with an interven 
ing interval of about two hundred yards. Between the two 
Brigades there was a ridge of land parallel with the line of 
march, which cut the left of the 2d Brigade from the view of 
the right of the 1st. This contributed not a little to the disas 
ter of the day. Our own Regiment held the right of the 1st 
Brigade. Our route up from the low land led us through some 
thick underbrush, coming out of which, about one hundred 
yards in front, and at short rifle range from the enemy, was a 
low stone wall. We hurried our pace to get the protection of 
this wall, leaving on the way some men, and I think, one or 
two officers. When we gained the cover of the wall, we opened 
fire. The Rebels had much the advantage of position; the low 
wall not affording us much protection from their plunging fire, 
while they were much better covered by the brow of the hill. 
At first, it seemed to me that the enemy was in small force ; 
and I was anxious to have an advance ordered, feeling sure 
that we could rout them, and perhaps capture their guns. In 



373 

this I was mistaken ; as the result proved that Early had his 
whole force just over and behind the hill, and in and around 
Strasburg. Believing that the 2d Brigade was quite near, on 
our right, I had paid but little attention to my flank, although 
I was 011 the extreme right of our Regiment and Brigade ; nor 
did I dream of danger from that quarter, till one of my men 
called my attention to a body of grey-backs advancing upon us 
from that direction. Calling to Capt. Elwell, next on my left, 
we " changed direction " and formed our men at right angles 
to our former line, and by a few well directed vollies repelled 
this movement. Instantly we wheeled forward into line again. 
As we did so, the Rebels made another demonstration against 
our flank, this time with largely increased numbers. We 
changed the direction of our two companies again, showing 
front to the enemy ; sent word to the Colonel, of this movement 
by the Rebels, and poured our vollies into them. It was evi 
dent now, however, that something was wrong. Were we cut 
off from the other Brigade ? Everything indicated it. Yet we 
stood and held our ground. We had, in reality, lost no ground, 
when an order came up to us from the left, directing a retreat. 
The Regiment fell back, by the left flank, in order to regain, 
more quickly, the low ground and woods to our rear, in that 
direction. As my company was on the right, I Avas among the 
very last to retire. While running along by the side of the 
wall, I saw Col. Wells lying upon the ground, wounded, and 
Lieut. Cobb sitting near him, whether wounded or not, I could 
not see. I stopped, hoping it might be possible to help the 
Colonel off the iicld. I saw soon that his wound was mortal ; 
and learned that he had entrusted other officers with his watch, 
and messages to his relatives and friends. To me, he said that 
lie was dying; that the defeat of the 1st Brigade was owing to 
the falling back of the 2d without giving any notice to us, thus 
enabling the enemy, under cover of the woods, to advance, 
unperceived, and outflank us." He ordered me to leave him 
and follow the Regiment. Inasmuch as Lieut. Cobb persisted 
in remaining with him, I started. The Regiment had got out 
of sight in the ravine, and the enemy, only fifteen or twenty 
yards distant, was coming on at a run. Disregarding many 
28 



374 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

loud and oft repeated invitations to halt, I put out my best 
speed. I could feel their balls striking the ground at my feet, 
and could hear them whizzing uncomfortably near my head. 
But I ran, as I never ran before in my life, for about one hun 
dred yards farther, Avhen. in crossing a rocky ravine, I stumbled 
and fell. My pursuers were close upon me when I regained 
my feet, and in fact, others from the flank were ahead of me. 
There was nothing to do but to surrender, which I did ; and 
was given permission to go to the rear. Rejoining Col. Wells 
and Lieut. Cobb, I found the Colonel to be sinking very fast. 
Placing him upon a blanket, we carried him back to the hill 
from which the Rebel batteries were still playing upon our 
retreating comrades. Here we were met by Gen. Early. He 
asked what officer it was, and upon being told that it was Col. 
Wells, inquired if it was the same who commanded the forces 
upon the Valley expedition of December last. Upon receiving 
our affirmative, the General ordered up an ambulance, into which 
we placed the Colonel just as he breathed his last. Thus died 
our beloved commander ; always brave and cool, strict in disci 
pline, and thoughtful for the welfare of his soldiers, and the 
reputation of the Regiment." 

Capt. Willard continues his narrative thus : " As I turned 
from helping to place the body of the Colonel in the ambu 
lance, I received a very civil invitation to take a long walk up 
the Valley, under the care of an ill looking fellow, with a mus 
ket on his shoulder. Escorted into Strasburg, I was soon 
joined by Lieuts. Cobb and Calligan, who had received a simi 
lar invitation, and some twenty to thirty of our own men, 
besides others from other Regiments. In a few days we all 
entered the famous " Libby " prison in Richmond. As we 
traveled back through and among Early s men, we learned from 
them that their force engaged amounted to between eight and 
ten thousand men ; so our two little Brigades might well 
enough retreat. Subsequently, I learned that the movement 
on our part was ordered only as a means of ascertaining the 
strength of the force before us ; and that Gen. Thoburn des 
patched an officer early in the affair, with orders to each com 
mander to withdraw his force ; which officer, having delivered 
the order to the 2d Brigade, on Ris way to ours, had had his 



FISHER S HILL. 375 

horse shot under him, and was cut off from Col. Wells by this 
flank movement of the Rebels." 

The richly-earned, well-deserved, but long-delayed promotion 
to a Brevet Brigadiership came to the command when the 
Colonel had passed from the earth, and could not feel that his 
services had at length been appreciated and rewarded. 

Our own loss in the affair was 1 officer and 8 men killed on the 
field, 1 officer wounded and dying on the 17th ; 2 officers and 
48 men wounded, and 3 officers and 39 men taken prisoners. 

A flag of truce was sent out the next day for the body of 
Col. Wells. Upon its being given up, it was brought into 
camp, and with none but necessary delay Avas sent forward to 
his family in Massachusetts, under the charge of Lieuts. Macom- 
ber and Ripley. 

In reference to this affair, Capt. Elwell writes: " Col. AVells was mortally wounded 
in an engagement here yesterday, and left a prisoner in the hands of the enemy. Our 
brigade (Wells ) and one other took part in the movement. The enemy was much 
stronger than the small force sent out by us, and we were forced to retire. The Colonel 
was struck by a rifle ball, nearly in the centre of his body, just below the breast-bone, 
piercing him through and through. He was mounted at the time, and engaged in 
directing the movement of his brigade. He slid directly from his horse to the ground, 
was immediately surrounded by his officers, and urged to remount his horse and be 
taken to the rear. But he would not mount, nor would he consent to be carried 
back. A few moments later came the order to retreat, and, the enemy being within a 
stone s throw of us, we were forced to retire, and leave him on the field. AVe did this 
at his own request and imperative order, as he felt his wound was mortal, he saying, It 
is of no use, gentlemen. I cannot live. Let me lie here. Take my money and watch, 
and save yourselves. Lieut. Cobb, of our regiment, remained voluntarily with him, 
and was captured. God only knows how tenderly and sincerely we all loved him, and 
how grieved and heartstricken we are at his loss. The 34th has lost its idol ; and the 
service one of the best officers that ever stood before the enemy. Our regiment has 
suffered very severely, as we always have whenever engaged. Capt. Soley is severely 
wounded by shell ; Lieut Dempsey killed ; Capt. AVillard and Lieut Calligan missing ; 
Lieut. Cobb, A. A. A. G., prisoner. Our list is not perfect; but as far as now known, 
we have four killed, forty wounded and sixty-four missing." 

An army correspondent, writing of this affair from Middletown, says: "The 34th, 
during this engagement, gave another striking indication of their gallantry and 
soldierly qualities. The 1st Brigade of the 1st division, commanded by Col. AVells, of 
the 34th Massachusetts regiment, though charged by the enemy repeatedly, stood their 
ground nobly," 

The reconnoisance having thus terminated, a strong picket 
line was thro\vn out in front of the brigade. Slight firing was 
indulged in by the men of the two lines, until about midnight, 
when an advance, cautiously made, revealed the fact that the 
enemy had retired. 



CHAPTER XLIV. 



BATTLE OF CEDAR CREEK. 

No movement, of any importance, was made by either army 
for a day or two. Our own condition was one of entire in 
action ; the 5th New York in its turn being on the picket line. 
As the evening of the 18th set in, a dense fog rose which wrapt 
everything in a darkness which could almost be felt. So dense 
was it, that in the language of one present " it was difficult to 
distinguish a figure standing face to face." Deep quiet was 
upon the camp, and nothing but our watch-fires betrayed our 
presence. Relying upon the report of our reconnoitering party, 
all slept in confidence and security. But, notwithstanding that 
report, Early was near at hand ; his entire army securely hid 
from observation in the woods around Strasburg. Smarting 
under his recent defeat, perhaps induced to venture, by the 
reported departure of the 6th Corps for Washington, ho 
resolved to attack Sheridan, and to use his own language, u as 
I (he) was not strong enough to attack the fortified position 
in front, I (he) determined to get around one of the enemy s 
flanks, and attack him by surprise if I (he) could." His 
examination satisfied him that this attack could be made, with 
prospect of success, only upon our left flank and rear. " The 
plan of attack upon which I determined," writes Gen. Early, 
" was to send the three divisions of the 2d Corps, to wit : 
Gordon s, Ramseur s, and Pegram s, under Gen. Gordon, to the 
enemy s rear, to make the attack at 5 o clock in the morning ; 
to move myself with Kershaw s and Wharton s divisions, and 
all the Artillery, along the pike, through Strasburg, and attack 
the enemy on the front and left flank, as soon as Gordon should 
become engaged ; and for Rosser to move with his own and 
Wickham s Brigade on the back road, across Cedar creek, and 



THE BATTLE OF CEDATt CREEK, 377 

attack the enemy s Cavalry, simultaneously with Gordon s 
attack, while Lomax should move by Front Royal, cross the 
liver, and come to the Valley pike, so as to strike the enemy 
wherever he might be, of which he was to judge by the sound 
of the firing." 

Gordon s route was between Massanutten Mountain and the 
Shenandoah river, by a blind path, practicable for Infantry, but 
not for Artillery. Gordon moved and got into position as 
directed ; " Kershaw s division got in sight of the enemy s fires, 
at half-past three o clock ; at half-past four he was ordered 
forward, and a very short time after, the firing from Kosser on 
our left, and the picket firing at the ford at which Gordon was 
crossing, was heard." The Rebels advanced unperceived by 
our picket line, which was captured almost to a man, and 
entered Crook s camp almost without firing a shot. Now 
uttering their shrill yells of triumph, and opening a- heavy 
musketry fire, he swept along our works, meeting but little 
opposition (many of our men still sleeping in their tents), and 
driving before him a confused mass of half dressed, partially 
armed soldiers. At the first sound of the attack, " our own 
regiment and brigade fell into line behind our breastworks." 
" The men of other brigades " failed to hear, or hearing, failed 
to observe the warning, and were too slow in getting in." Our 
flank was easily turned. " Our own brigade, the only one in 
the division not surprised," made such resistance as was pos 
sible ; but overwhelmed by the immense superiority of the 
enemy, was forced to give ground. u We fell slowly back;" 
the broken ranks of the other brigades rallying upon our line. 
The men of the 19th Corps had caught the alarm, and were in 
line as we reached their encampment. Joining their 1st 
division we made a good stand, and temporarily checked the 
enemy s advance. But we were soon out-flanked, and were 
again compelled to give away. Taking a new position, on the 
west side of the creek, near Middletown, we renewed the 
action. Here the battle hung for a time, with heavy loss to 
each side. But we were driven again. Now keeping up a 
running fight for some three or four miles, we met the 6th 
Corps drawn up in line, with all their artillery in position. 



378 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. - 

It held a ridge to the west of Middletown, and was not easily 
to be dispossessed. 

As before, Early attacked with vigor ; directing his main 
effort against our left and centre, in the hope of getting between 
us and Winchester. The roar of Artillery and roll of musketry 
was incessant; these mingled with, but did not drown, the 
yells and cheers of the combatants. 

Ouster and Merritt led their squadrons against the enemy 
with but partial success. We now occupied a point on the 
north of Middletown, about three miles from the Winchester 
Pike, where by great efforts, under a partial relaxation of the 
enemy s attack, a new line of battle was formed. It was 
nearly noon. The scene was one of indescribable confusion. 
Long lines of ambulances and army wagons were being driven 
hurriedly along the pike, in frantic efforts to gain our rear ; 
Artillery and Caissons were being drawn from the woods, 
and across intervening fields, to position in the direction of 
Newtown ; confused crowds of non-combatants, officers ser 
vants, wounded soldiers, stragglers, all alike demoralized, 
were streaming towards Winchester ; while here and there, far 
away, and near at hand, embodied troops, in line, and column, 
upon whose arms the sun shone with great brilliancy, could be 
seen, fast moving into position. Retreat was no longer thought 
of by us ; and Early says " it was apparent at this time that it 
would not do to press his troops farther." Crook, on the left, 
now held the Winchester Pike; next came the 19th Corps, 
while the 6th held the right of the line. Either flank was 
covered by Cavalry. So stood matters when Sheridan rode on 
to the field. The news of his arrival quickly spread, and new 
spirit seemed to animate the men. Firing was now renewed, 
and shells from the enemy s batteries were dropped in our lines. 
Our own Artillery was responding briskly, though, as yet, there 
was nothing like a general engagement. Some few changes in 
the disposition of the Cavalry were ordered by Gen. Sheridan, 
when the order " forward, along the line," was given. 

It was about half-past one. "Getty s Division of the 6th Corps, 
supported by the 2d Division of Crook s army of West Virginia 
in solid mass, their left flank protected by a large body of Cav- 



THE BATTLE OP CEDAR CREEK. 379 

airy, covered by a heavy fire from batteries posted on the slopes 
of near commanding hills, led the opening movement against the 
enemy." Other masses, in similar formation, followed in quick 
succession. A furious fire of shot and shell struck them, before 
which the lines faltered; but recovering, they went forward 
with a cheer. The enemy s ranks shook, then swayed, then 
melted away before this charge. There was a dash forward by 
the whole army ; and so hotly was the enemy pressed, that he 
found it impossible to rally. He was driven out of Middle town, 
and by the Pike, and across the country, towards the Creek and 
Strasburg, over the ground he had so lately traversed in the 
flush of success ; and so closely pursued that the rear of the 
flying, and the head of the pursuing forces, came together on 
the scene of the morning s surprise. Back through the camps 
which they had swept in the morning, the beaten rebels ran, 
throwing away arms and everything which could impede their 
flight. The Cavalry kept up the pursuit for miles ; capturing 
the greater part of the enemy s Artillery, ordnance, and medical 
wagons; and retaking all which had been lost by us in the 
attack and surprise of the morning. 

" We stacked our arms behind the works from which we had 
been driven in the morning ; and slept that night, as we had 
fought that day, without food." Our own immediate loss was 
nine wounded (two mortally), and thirty-four taken prisoners.

" MARKER" -AT NEWTOWN ON THE OPEQUAN 

- OUR ROLLS MARCHING ORDERS ~ 

TO THE JAMES RIVER. 



Among our wounded was Captain Soley, struck by a piece of shell, which plowed 
its way through the thickest part of the thigh, opening a furrow in which one s arm 
could easily be buried. It was the Captain s good fortune to be carried to Field 
Hospital in "Winchester, then in charge of Dr. Smith, Assistant Surgeon of the 34-th, 
skilful practitioner, tender nurse, and kind and sympathizing friend. The Captain 
himself was of a cool and calculating temperament, accustomed to take things philoso 
phically. He looked upon a wound received in action as, according to regula 
tions, and to be borne with patience and fortitude. But long weeks of helplessness 
and suffering go far to destroy both mental and physical energy; and with departing 
strength, came diminished cheerfulness and lessened hope. Smith saw with con 
cern the growth of the unfavorable symptoms; and set himself to counteract the 
increasing despondency. He told his best stories, reported the current news and 
latest anecdotes, even essayed a song, a la Willard ; but to no purpose. The Captain 
would nt be charmed. So, in very despair, one morning Smith, caught a honey bee, 
from which he carefully removed its sting, and calling the Captain s attention to it, 
he drew down the bed covering, and carefully placed the insect xipon the naked skin 
of the wounded leg. Didn t " our army in Flanders " swear! No language can do jus 
tice to the Captain s invective, as he made up in strength of words for the weakness 
of body which prevented him from thrashing Smith on the spot. Satisfied after a 
while that his patient was mad, clear through, Smith again caught the bee, and thus 
addressed his patient: "Now, look here, you fool! See what a fuss you ve been 
making for nothing ! Before I put it into bed with you I pulled out this fellow s 
sting ! Do you see ?" and he exhibited the disarmed insect. The insult was worse 
than the injury that had been anticipated. The glare from the Captain s eyes and 
the renewed invective from his lips satisfied the Doctor that his application had been 
successful. So, prescribing "fifteen drops to be taken every ten minutes," Smith 
went his way rejoicing ; and Soley took the first step on his long march to recovery. 
The Captain still lives ; and as he tells the story, confesses that he would prefer to 
face the shell again, rather than endure the agony he suffered, when the bee was 
raiding up and down his naked flesh. 

As before stated, the morning s attack w r as a perfect surprise; and although at the 
first alarm the regiment hastily armed and repaired to its proper position behind the 



CEDAR CREEK. 381 

breastworks, the non-combatants, company, and hospital cooks and attendants, less 
prompt to move in sudden emergencies, were many of them captured. Of these 
"OldZeke" was the best known character. He was of K; was early detailed as 
hospital cook ; and had been distinguished for the*diligeiice with which he read his 
Testament daily, and traded hospital pork nightly with the poor widows of Bolivar, 
for spiritual consolation. 

Who of xis will ever forget him? or the grotesque appearance he made as he 
trudged the weary miles of Hunter s raid, dressed in the long, swallow-tailed, black 
dress coat which he had "drawn" on some foraging expedition ; grasping in one 
hand his long staff", and in the other an end of the rope by which he dragged along 
his diminutive little mule; for all the world like Joseph journeying into Egypt, 
as pictured in the school books of former days. He had caught the first notes 
of the morning s alarm, and, securing his mule, hurried to the rear. He was 
safely away, when it flashed upon him that he had left behind a volume, none the 
less valued, because in some mysterious manner it had found its way into his knap 
sack, from the library in that aristocratic old mansion raided upon near the Sulphur 
Springs. Instantly he stopped, tied his mule to a tree, and began to retrace his 
steps. His comrades warned him of his danger. But he turned a deaf ear. To all 
remonstrances he replied only by exclaiming " 1 want my Life of Christ ! " "I must 
have my Life of Christ ! " He was last seen as he was swallowed up in the band of 
fugitives who were hurrying to the rear. Let us hope that from his recovered 
volume, he derived pleasure enough to console him for the weary moments of his 
long captivity. 

Another incident of the day, illustrative of the uncertainties of the things of this 
life, is full of interest. While 011 duty in Washington, we had procured some white 
silk nags, bordered with heavy fringe (on which our regimental designation was 
marked in gold leaf), to be used as "markers;" such being in better keeping with 
our white gloves and Avell polished scales, than the ordinary ones furnished by the 
Government. Fastened upon short staves which were inserted in the muzzles of their 
muskets, they were carried by our right and left general guides. At the battle of 
Xew Market, one of these guides tore his marker from its staff, and put it in his 
pocket. The other guide intended to thurst the staff of his under his body belt. 
But he either did nt do so, or did it so carelessly that it was lost. Naturally it was 
a trophy, not to be neglected by any rebel who might chance to see it. Of course, 
too, its loss was a great mortification to the whole command. Now, at the close of 
this day s contest, upon reoccupyiiig the camp from which we had been so summa 
rily ejected, stretched upon the ground, lay the body of a stalwart rebel, and by his 
side his knapsack, partially filled with the plunder he had gathered from our tents. 
A little examination disclosed to our eyes, closely folded and carefully wrapped in 
an outer covering of cloth, the lost marker of the 31th. Jt is needless to add that its 
recovery was hailed with great joy, not only by its former bearer, but by every man 
in the command . 

The defeat of the Kebel army was complete. Disorganized 
and dispirited, nowhere attempting to make a stand, it melted 
away before our cavalry, which hung on to, and harrassed its 
flying remnants. 

While the main army was lying idle in camp, the 34th 
was detailed to act as provost guard in the town of Newtown ; 
officers and men without tents. Our stay in this place was 



382 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

protracted for some weeks ; at the end of which time, upon the 
falling back of the entire force. to Winchester, we rejoined our 
brigade, and went into camp at the railroad crossing of the 
Opequan. 

The tiresome duty of picketing the neighboring country, 
and guarding the railroad bridge which crossed the creek near 
our encampment, mainly occupied us. Drills were resumed. 
So far as the officers were concerned, their time was taken up 
in straightening out their accounts, and making up the rolls of 
their companies. F company was detailed as provost guard at 
brigade headquarters. 

Our muster rolls for October show present for duty, 9 offi 
cers and 270 enlisted men. Absent on detached service, 7 
officers ; on leave, 5 ; sick, 5 ; prisoners of war, 7. 38 enlisted 
men were on detached service ; 26 absent on furlough ; 4 with 
out leave ; 329 sick ; and 175 prisoners of war. 

Among the officers the following changes had occurred : 
Maj. H. W. Pratt died Sept. 26th, of wounds received Sept. 22 ; 
Col. Geo. D. Wells, killed in action, Oct. 13 ; Capt. Alexis C. 
Soley, wounded Oct. 13, and in hospital at Winchester ; Lieut. 
Jas. L. Dempsey, died Oct. 17th, of wounds received Oct. 13th ; 
Capt. Wells Willard, Lieut, and A. A. A. G. Wm. L. Cobb, and 
Lieut. John E. Calligan, captured Oct. 13 ; Lieut. Fred. A. 
Judd and Lieut. Melville E. Walker, wounded Sept. 19th, and 
absent on sick leave ; Lieut. Robert W. Walker, paroled pris 
oner at Annapolis; Lieut, and Acting Adj t Thomas W. Ripley 
and Lieut. Charles E. Cutler, absent in Massachusetts on sick 
leave ; and Lieut. Col.William S. Lincoln, on sick leave in Massa 
chusetts, having made his escape from the hands of the enemy. 

Our November roll shows the following changes : 3 officers 
only were present for duty ; 6 being on extra or daily duty and 
1 present, sick ; 2 were on detached service ; one absent with

dismissal; one, Lieut Ripley, by transfer; two, Capt. John A. 
Lovell, and Lieut. R. W. Walker, by discharge ; and one, Lieut. 
Malcolm Ammidon by disease. Fourteen men had died from 
wounds received in action, and one by disease. 

Lieut. Col. Lincoln had been mustered in as Col., vice Wells, 
killed in action; Capt. Andrew Potter as Major, vice Pratt, died 
of wounds; and Lieut. Col., vice Lincoln promoted ; and Capt. 
A. D. Pratt as Major, vice Potter, promoted. 

Col. Lincoln was on detached service at Cumberland. Major 
and Surgeon R. R. Clarke was acting Medical Director on 
Division Staff. Lieut, and Assist. Surgeon Cyrus B. Smith 
was acting as Surgeon in charge of field hospital at Winchester. 
Capt. C. W. Elwell was serving as A. A. I. G., and Lieut. Thos. 
W. Ripley, as A. A. A. G. on Brigade Staff; Capt, F. X. Leach, 
acting Judge Advocate General on Court Martial. Capt. Lovell 
and Lieut. R. W. Walker had been discharged on account of 
disability. 

Lieuts. Van Loan and Macomber had been promoted to 
Captaincies. Goodrich to a 1st Lieutenancy, and detailed as 
Acting Adjutant; Murdock to a 1st Lieutenancy and detailed 
as Acting Quartermaster; 2d Lieuts. Judd, Blake, and Hall, 
who was now relieved from duty on the signal corps, were 
promoted to be 1st Lieutenants; and Sergeants E. A . Lilly, 
Chas. I. Woods, Herbert J. Rowley, Wells B. Mitchell, and 
Harlaii P. Houghton had received promotion to 2d Lieuten 
ancies. 

Late in November, Col. Lincoln, whose wound was still 
unhealed, came up, under orders "to report to the commander of 
the army in the field," and was ordered to detached service in 
Cuniberlaiid. He brought with him, and presented to the regi 
ment in few but touching words, a beautiful new national flag 
of silk, which the ladies of the City of Worcester desired to 
exchange for that one, of their earlier gift, which had been 
proudly carried in so many fields of battle, and whose tattered 
folds, stained by the blood of its brave defenders, was so dear 
to us. The exchange was made amid the hearty cheers of the 
men, whose cheeks were wet by tears which could not be 
suppressed. 



384 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

We laid at this point, undisturbed, until the 17th day of 
December, when, very unexpectedly, we received marching- 
orders, which directed " the removal of the entire 1st Division 
of the army of West Virginia, to the army of the James," lying 
before Richmond. The removal was distasteful to the men of 
the entire command. Representations from the commanding 
officers of the armies in the field, were forwarded to the 
department at Washington, setting forth the impolicy of trans 
ferring from the valley a force intimately acquainted with the 
peculiarities of the country, even though, as was to be the case, 
the trained warriors of the 6th and 19th corps, were to remain. 
These representations were supported by remonstrances from 
the Governors of the states of Ohio and West Virginia, 
which were continued, even long after the transfer was effected. 
But all was of no avail ; and on the afternoon of the 19th of 
December, the entire Division marched to Stevenson s Depot, 
and, the next day, took transportation, on the railroad, for 
Washington. A short stop was made at Harper s Ferry, where 
many old friends gave us kindly greeting. Washington was 
reached the next morning. Here the command embarked upon 
transports ; the 34th, on the steamer Massachusetts, sailing with 
sealed orders. A violent storm drove our own and other 
transports into Cherry Stone inlet, where we were compelled 
to lie for two days. On the 23d we got under way, and reached 
Fortress Munroe ; made City Point the next day ; and on the 
25th disembarked at Aiken s Landing, and, marching out to a 
point at the extreme right of the line of investment about 
Richmond, pitched our tents at " Camp Holly."

We take the place of the 2d Division of that Corps, now forming 
a part of the expeditionary force sent against " Fort Fisher ; " are 
designated, and are to be known as the "Independent Division,

was deep, fuel scarce, and hard to be got, and our condition 
anything but comfortable. But chopping parties were at once 
detailed, and our men were soon enjoying the warmth and shelter 
of comfortable " log houses." Our life was one of comparative 
inactivity. Lieut. Col. Wild, of the 116th Ohio, who had been 
in command of the Brigade since the death of Col. Wells, went 
home in January, on leave, and was succeeded by Lieut. Col. 
Potter, of the 34th, as A. B. G. Capt. Frank T. Leach, Co. G., 
assumed command of the Regiment. Frequent and rigid 
inspections, squad, company and regimental drills were had 
during these Winter months; and every effort was made to keep 
the reputation of the Regiment, for drill and discipline, and of 
its individual members, for soldierly bearing, up to its former 
high standard. The duty required of us was light, and all 
enjoyed the comparative rest which followed our Summer s 
hardships and toil. 



386 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

There were present, for duty, in December, eight officers: 
Five were on extra or daily duty, twelve absent on detached 
service, one absent with leave, two were absent sick, and five 
were prisoners of war. 

Of the enlisted men, two hundred and fifty-five were present 
for duty ; forty-two were on extra or daily duty, and five were 
sick ; eighty-two were on detached duty ; thirty-eight absent 
with leave ; five absent without leave ; two hundred and forty- 
four absent sick; five absent in arrest; and one hundred and 
forty-three were prisoners of war. The Regiment gained two 
recruits from depot, and one by enlistment. Lost two by dis 
charge on account of disability; five by death from wounds 
received in action, and three from disease. 

Lieut. Henry Bacon had been discharged for disability, and 
Lieut. Ammidon had died in Rebel prison. 

The men of the Regiment suffered greatly, for some weeks, for 
want of necessary clothing, requisitions for which had been but 
partially filled. More especially was this true in regard to the 
article of shoes, for want of which "there is almost always 
somebody barefooted." 

There were mustered this month (January), present for duty, 
five officers : Eight were on extra duty ; thirteen absent on 
detached service ; one with leave ; one sick, and five prisoners of 
war. Of enlisted men, two hundred and eighty one were pres 
ent for duty ; forty-nine on daily or extra duty ; thirteen were 
sick, and one in arrest. Eighty-six were on detached service ; 
forty-one absent with leave ; two without leave ; two hundred 
and eight absent sick ; two absent in arrest, and one hundred 
and thirty-four were prisoners of war. The Regiment had 
gained seven recruits from depot, and one by enlistment ; two 
from missing in action, and one, from desertion. And it had 
lost by discharge on account of disability, four ; by order, one ; 
by died of wounds, three, and of disease, three. 

Capt. Goodrich was in Massachusetts on leave ; Lieut. H. T, 
Hall on special duty as Judge Advocate General ; Lieut. Cutler

With the opening spring, indications of renewed activity 
appeared. Our rest was broken in March ; on the twenty- 
fifth day of which month the entire Division marched to the 
Chickahominy, ten miles, to cover the crossing of that river by 
Sheridan, who was en route with his Cavalry from Winchester 
to Richmond. The movement was well-timed, as Sheridan s 
arrival was almost simultaneous with our own. The men of 
the two parties exchanged hearty cheers at the meeting; and, 
with little delay, we started on our return ; reaching " Deep 
Bottom " 011 the next day, after a inarch of twelve miles. We 
bivouacked here for the night ; and about 5 P. M. of the 27th, 
crossed the James, under cover of the darkness. Continuing 
by an all night s march, conducted in rear of the lines of the 
main army, we halted about 8 A. M. of the 28th, occupying 
ground just vacated by the men of the 2d Corps. The march 
was slow and tedious, because of the darkness of the night, and 
the deep mud of the roads. On the morning of the 29th, the 
1st and Independent Divisions of the 24th, strengthened by the 
1st Division of the 25th Corps, were again set in motion 
towards " the left ; " and crossing " Hatcher s Run," were 
assigned to a position in the lines of investment about Peters 
burg, on the right of the 2d Corps. We set about the work of 



BEFORE RICHMOND. 389 

entrenching ourselves, without delay. The whole of the suc 
ceeding night was spent building breastworks of rails. and loose 
stones, and digging and throwing up the earth, with our 
bayonets and dinner plates, for want of better intrenching 
tools. The rain came down incessantly, rendering the work 
uncomfortable enough. On the 31st, brisk skirmishing was 
opened between the men 011 the opposing lines, which was con 
tinued for a while ; after which, by a determined advance, we 
drove the enemy, and took and occupied the lines he had lost. 
The loss in the Brigade was ninety; our own being one man 
killed ; and Lieut. Judd, serving as Aid to Gen. Turner, and 
thirteen men wounded. We laid the rest of the day exposed 
to a sharp fire, but without sustaining loss. Our skirmishers 
were well advanced on this day, and a sharp fire was kept up 
between the two lines. Breastworks were thrown up }yy us, 
within about 200 yards of those held by the enemy, behind 
which we laid safely. Exhausted by the struggle and labors of 
the day and night previous, we laid down with guns in hand, 
trusting to the vigilance and strength of our picket line. 

In this month there were present for duty, 9 officers; on 
special duty, 7 ; sick, 2 ; absent on detached service, 10 ; with 
leave, 5 : sick, 2. Of enlisted men, there were present for 
duty, 318 ; on extra duty, 49 ; sick, 3. Absent on detached 
service, 96 ; absent with leave, 67 ; sick, 156 ; in arrest, 2 ; 
prisoners of w^ar, 89. The regiment had lost, by discharge on 
account of disability, eight men ; by death from disease, 9 ; and 
by desertion, 2 men. 

Capts. Willard and Chauncey, and Lieuts. Cobb and Platt 
and Calligan, had been paroled, and were home on leaves 
of absence ; Lieut. Platt having resigned, and his resignation 
been accepted. The regiment was under the command of Capt. 
Leach, Lieut. Murdock, Acting Adjutant.

BEFORE RICHMOND. 

APRIL 1 SKIRMISHING BATTERY "GREGG" OUR LOSS 
LIEUT. ROWLEY S LETTER EVACUATION or PETERS 
BURG A MARCH GENERAL ORDERS. 

About 4 A. M. of the 1st day of April, we were roused by a 
vigorous charge made by the Rebels upon our first line. This 
was handsomely repulsed ; and for the remainder of the day 
we were undisturbed, save by the firing on the skirmish line, 
which was kept up without intermission. At three o clock the 
next morning we were quietly roused, and piling our knap 
sacks, canteens, &c., were moved against two slight works in 
our immediate front, which we gained with little loss. Advanc 
ing again, this time by the left flank, a distance of about two 
miles, we halted for a short space. The fight had now become 
general ; the roar of cannon and small arms was deafening. 
Everything gave evidence of the serious nature of the work 
before us. " Battery Gregg," a strong earthwork, was imme 
diately in front. It was ours to assault. Could we take it, the 
Rebel line was untenable. 

Our formation was in column by brigade, our own brigade in 
advance. The order reached us at about 11 o clock. Moving 
directly against the work, a terrific fire of musketry, and grape 
and canister struck us in front, while shells from all the 
neighboring works, were directed against our flanks. u When 
within one hundred yards of the work," writes Capt. Leach, 
our gallant leader on that day, " we were obliged to lie down, 
and crawl upon our hands and knees ; the enemy, all the time 
pouring grape and canister into our ranks, at a furious rate. 
But not a man flinched, although dead and dying comrades 



BEFORE RICHMOND. 391 

were lying thickly strewed upon the ground. The ditch around 
the fort was reached at last, and although the water in it stood 
waist deep, the brave fellows hesitated not to jump in, and 
scramble up the bank of the fort, vainly attempting to rush in 
en masse, and end the bloody struggle. Soon the stars and 
stripes could be seen floating by the side of the Rebel rag ; 
cheer after cheer rent the air, the Rebels fighting with the 
desperation of madmen, and shouting to each other "never 
surrender ! never surrender ! " For twenty-seven minutes we 
hung upon the works, knowing we could not retreat if we 
wished to. One more rush and we were inside the fort, and 
and for a minute or two there was a hand to hand contest. The 
works were ours ; and the garrison, dead and alive. Not a man 
escaped. Capt. Goodrich, with a few men, instantly turned 
the captured guns upon the nearest works occupied by the 
enemy, and gave them a few shells we had no other use for. 
Very soon the other forts were abandoned by their, or captured 
by our men. Considering the work we of the 34th had done, our 
loss was light ; being only three officers slightly wounded, five 
men killed, and thirty-two wounded. Arms were stacked, and 
the men put to work upon a new line of entrenchments, that 
we might hold what we had gained." 

Of the morning s work, Lieut. Rowley of the 34th writes: 
" Before we had time to see what we had taken (the two 
works first assaulted), we were moved to Petersburg, got in 
the rear of the Rebel works, and charged Fort Gregg. This 
we took after the most stubborn resistance I ever saw; the 
very hardest fighting we have ever had. Our men charged 
the Fort, jumped into the deep, wide trench, and with the 
help of bayonets stuck into the side of the bank or walls, 
climbed up to the parapet; and after we had got on to the 
walls of the Fort, the Rebels held us there over twenty-five 
minutes, fighting like madmen. We found fifty-seven dead 
Rebels inside the Fort, besides their wounded and prisoners. 
The Union loss was seventy killed, and, I don t know how 
many, wounded." 

During the night the enemy quietly withdrew from Peters 
burg, evacuating also Richmond, arid abandoning its strong 
lines of defense. 



392 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

April 3d. With the coming of morning we were moved in 
pursuit of Lee and his army ; marching to " Sutherland," a 
little village about ten miles distant. Here we bivouacked ; 
and on the next day marched to "Wilson s Station," fifteen 
miles. Starting again early on the 5th, we marched along the 
Southside Railroad to Burkesville, a distance of twenty-seven 
miles. It was 11 P. M., when, jaded and completely worn out, 
we were allowed to halt. Here was promulgated an order, of 
which the following is a copy : 

HEADQUARTERS 24TH ARMY CORPS, 

Behind Richmond, April 3, 1865. 
GENERAL ORDERS No. 41. 

" With great satisfaction the Major General commanding 
congratulates his gallant command upon the successful opera 
tions of the last few days. The 24th Corps has demonstrated 
that with a well organized and disciplined force, no military 
achievement is impossible. The marching has been superior to 
anything of the kind heretofore witnessed, and the desperate 
assault upon Fort Gregg, the last of the enemy s strongholds 
around Petersburg, entitles this command to a place along with 
their late gallant comrades of Fort Fisher. Your commander 
is proud of you."

ORD S COMMAND. 

We had now gathered square upon the flank of Lee s army, 
which was to the north of us, marching towards " Farmsville." 
Now on the 6th, the 54th Pennsylvania, and 123d Ohio of our 
Brigade, the whole under command of Col. Kellogg of the last 
Regiment, were detached from the Brigade ; arid, strengthened 
by a squadron of the 4th. Massachusetts Cavalry, marched across 
the country to hold, or, if that was impossible, to destroy the 
bridge which spanned the k Appomatox" at "Rice s Station;" 
and thus cut off the enemy s retreat in that direction. The 
head of Lee s army was met near that point, and a sharp engage 
ment ensued. Our force was largely outnumbered; but not 
withstanding the disparity of numbers, held the enemy at 
bay for hours. The Cavalry charged again and again, but 
unavailingly. In a last desperate effort to regain the main 
army, they rode gallantly against the enemy, losing their com 
mander and eleven other officers. The Infantry maintained the 
unequal struggle until their ammunition was exhausted, when 
Col. Kellogg attempted to withdraw it. Perceiving the inten 
tion, the Rebels swooped down in overwhelming force, and made 
the men of both Regiments prisoners. But the resistance had been 
long enough to enable Ord to come up with the remainder of 
his corps, and compel Lee to entrench. In the day s skirmish 
ing the loss sustained by the 34th was three men wounded. 



394 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Our march was ten miles. We reached "Farmsville" on the 7th, 
distant across the country ten miles, and on the 8th marched to 
" Appomatox Station," lying down between 11 and 12 o clock at 
night, after a weary tramp of 33 miles. Roused at 3 o clock on 
the morning of the 9th, we moved, at a " double quick," about 
two miles, to "Appomatox Court House." Here we found Sheri 
dan s troopers, dismounted, strenuously resisting the onward 
movement of Lee s army, which was pressing desperately, in the 
hope of crushing the Cavalry before the arrival of the Infantry, 
to the left, we formed line in rear of the Troopers. The attack 
Filing of the Rebels was furious and determined. As our Cav 
alry, giving ground, disclosedt he line of bayonets, gleaming in 
the rear, the Johnnies apparently lost heart. In turn they gave 
ground before our advance ; and in about an hour we had driven 
them back to, and upon their main army. A white flag fluttered 
above their ranks, and at 9 o clock we had orders to " cease 
firing." For a while the men of the two armies held their res 
pective positions. But the rumor soon spread that proposals 
for a surrender of the entire Rebel army were being considered, 
and many a cap was tossed, and many a heart beat high with 
hope. When, after a little while, word was passed along our 
lines that Gen. Lee had surrendered, men actually cried for 
great joy. Our lines were again formed, now within a half- 
mile of those of the Rebel army. Arms were again stacked, 
tents pitched, and we prepared to enjoy the rest we so much 
needed, and which, by our almost continuous marching and 
fighting of this last short campaign, we had so well earned. 
The men of the two armies, alike joyous over the capitulation, 
mingled freely together; more like friends than like enemies, 
who for so long had held each other by the throat. 

Of these last days, Maj. Gen. Devens, before his comrades of 
the Army of the James, thus spoke : " On the morning of the 
9th of April, by a march almost unprecedented in the annals of 
warfare, the Army of the James had placed themselves across 
the Lynchburg road, and closed the avenues of escape. On 
that morning, Lieut. Gen. Gordon, of Georgia, who commanded 
the advance, said to Gen. Lee that 4 his way was barred. 4 It 
can be nothing but Cavalry, said Gen. Lee; brush them 



BEHIND RICHMOND. 395 

away ; no Cavalry can stand against Infantry. It was done as 
Gen. Lee ordered ; but as the Cavalry fell back, they revealed 
the long and gleaming line of steel, which marked the line of 
Infantry, of the Army of the James. There were Ord and Gib 
bon there were Turner and R. S. Foster at the head of their 
Divisions. To throw his exhausted troops upon that wall of 
steel, was a madness of which the Rebel chieftain was not capa 
ble, and the sword of Lee was laid in the conquering hand of 
Grant." 

From a Richmond paper of that month, we extract the fol 
lowing : " The 1st and 2d Divisions of the 24th Army Corps, 
who were engaged in the pursuit of Gen. Lee to Appomatox 
Court House, after the fall of Petersburg, returned to this cifrf 
on Tuesday morning. It is reported by military men that Gen. 
Lee s surrender was necessitated in consequence of the severe 
marching and skilful manoeuvring of these forces. Their march 
ing will compare with any on record. For four successive days 
they marched respectively eighteen, twenty-three, twenty-seven 
and thirty-two miles. By this rapid marching they were 
enabled to overtake, and surround the Confederate forces. Had 
these two Divisions been later in getting around to the right of 
Gen. Lee, it is confidently believed that Gen. Lee would have 
made his escape." 

" It was owing to Gen. Ord s energy that his troops marched 
thirty-eight miles from three o clock in the morning of April 
8th, to eleven o clock on the following night, when they quietly 
threw themselves down upon the ground, to rest, in front of 
Lee s army, without the enemy s suspecting, as acknowledged 
on the following morning, that there was an Infantry soldier 
within ten miles of them ; and by four o clock on the following 
morning, forming in line of battle, and fighting until a flag of 
truce was sent from the enemy, asking for a conference. The 
march certainly has 110 parallel in the history of the Rebellion, 
or any war in Europe."

MENT GENERAL ORDERS. 



We have remained in camp at this station, (Appomatox 
Court House,) witnesses to the formalities, and sharers of the joy 
incident to the surrender of the Rebel army, under Gen. Lee. But 
to-day, our brigade, in obedience to General Orders, moved on 
the road to Lynchburg. Marching seventeen miles, we went 
into camp. On the next day, about noon, we entered that city 
after a march of about six miles. Lieut. Col. Potter was ap 
pointed Provost Marshal, and the 34th was detailed for guard 
and patrol duty, during the occupation of the place by the 
Union force. The purpose of the visit was to seize, confiscate, 
and destroy the property of the Rebel Government, stored in 
the place. Immense quantities of stores were destroyed, 
including tobacco, large amounts of which were throivn into the 
James River. If men and officers appropriated to their own 
use such quantity of this latter article as they could conven 
iently carry with them, it was not regarded as a violation of 
orders, for were not the Philistines thereby despoiled ? The 
work of destruction having been fully done, we were on 
the return march, on the afternoon of the 15th. The 16th at 
night found us at Appomatox Court House again. Marching 
the 17th, 18th, and 19th, forty-four miles, we reached Burkes- 
ville, where we remained in camp three days, at the end of 
which time, taking to the road again, and passing via Amelia 



TO LYNCHBURG AND RICHMOND. 397 

Court House, we reached Manchester, on the 24th, after a 
march, since leaving Lynchburg, of one hundred and fourteen 
miles. The next day the Division entered the city of Richmond. 
It was received by Gen. Devens Division, which constituted 
the garrison for the time being, and which, drawn up on the 
main street, honored us with a salute, as we passed by. Thou 
sands of negroes thronged the streets through which we 
marched, and made the air ring with their shouts of welcome. 

We encamped on the north side of the city, about four miles 
out. The next morning, Col. Lincoln, who had been 011 
detached duty since joining in November last, came up, and, 
with him, a large detachment of convalescent and lately 
exchanged men. Upon reporting, he was assigned to the com 
mand of the brigade, relieving Lieut. Col. Potter, who in turn 
relieved Capt. Leach from command of the regiment. 

Throughout this campaign the 34th " maintained its well 
earned reputation for marching and fighting ; was noted for its 
discipline ; and received many compliments from the General 
commanding. Our Band, of which we were justly proud, 
never failed to cheer the sick and wounded with sweet music, 
or render assistance to suffering comrades." 

The ground first occupied by us was destitute of shade and 
water, and deep in dust or mud, as sunshine or rain prevailed. 
A search for a better location was rewarded by finding a piece 
of sward land, upon a gentle knoll, at the base of which was a 
small stream of quickly running water ; which, with the con 
sent of the Major General commanding, was soon occupied. 
If it had the advantage of giving us clean camping ground, 
(being separated from the camp of the remaining brigade s), it 
subjected us to extra duty on the picket line. Here, just out 
side of the line of Rebel earthworks, within short rifie range 
of a barn from which Dahlgren, on his former raid, took some 
horses for his command, we remained while in the city. Brig 
ade Headquarters were located on the banks of a little rivulet, 
running through a grove of magnificent tulip trees, just behind 
a four gun battery, which, on more than one occasion, had paid 
its shotted compliments to raiding parties, under our colors. 
Beautiful residences, for the most part abandoned and unoccu-

pied, were on all sides of us. From the gardens belonging to 
these estates, the officers derived supplies of toothsome veg 
etables. %t We hear of the muster out, at Annapolis, of Major 
Pratt, on account of disability." Although he had been recog 
nized as Major since his promotion ; at this late day, his muster 
in as of that rank is, by order of the War Department, set aside 
as irregular, and he mustered out as Captain, for the second 
time. Lieuts. Platt and Cobb, lately from Rebel prisons, are 
also discharged ; while Capts. Willard and Chauncey, and Lieut. 
Calligan, just exchanged, have rejoined the regiment. Capt. 
Fox is serving as Post Adjutant at Parole Camp in Annapolis. 

Our April return shows 13 officers present for duty ; on 
extra or daily duty, 6, and one sick; absent on detached 
service, 8 ; sick, 1 ; with leave, 1 ; paroled prisoner of war, 
1. Of enlisted men, 247 were present for duty ; 48 on extra 
or daily duty; 2 were sick; 105 were absent on detached 
service ; 147 were absent with leave ; 191 were absent, sick ; 
4 absent, in arrest ; and 53 were prisoners of war. The regi 
ment had lost 2 officers by resignation ; 11 men by discharge, 
by reason of disability ; 8 by death from wounds ; 8 by disease, 
and 1 by desertion. Col. Lincoln commanded the brigade; 
Col. Potter was serving on Military Commission in Richmond ; 
Capt. Willard had the regiment ; Lieut. Judd, A. A. A. G. on 
Division Staff, was absent, sick, from wounds received in action 
at Hatcher s Run. 

May ls. We are doing the usual ordinary camp duty 
sending out small parties to picket our front, and occasionally 
furnishing fatigue parties to the Quartermaster s Department 
in the city. 

Hunter of E, and Gardner of K, both of ours, have been 
selected from our Brigade to bear to Washington, and deliver 
to the War Department, the Rebel Flags captured by our Divis 
ion in the late campaign. 

2d. Twelve Rebels, five of whom claim to have belonged 
to Mosby s late command, surrendered themselves to-day, at 
our picket line, and were sent in to Brigade Headquarters. 
Three of them were officers. There was a good deal of good 
natured joking about the "tall walking" done by one or the 



TO LYNCHBTJRG AND RICHMOND. 399 

other party, in the valley, on various occasions the past season. 
What was better, was the anxiety to take the oath of allegiance 
to the United States shown by all the prisoners. 

Qth. The papers of to-day brought the General Orders of the 
War Department, relative to the speedy disbandment of this 
army; and Special Orders were sent down, directing the imme 
diate discharge of "all disabled men." Another order, looking 
more to our present support, directs the commanding officers of 
Brigades to detail a large party of men " accustomed to seine 
fishing" that a supply of " shad v may be procured. This, 
directed to men from the interior of Massachusetts and Ohio, 
where the water courses furnish nothing larger than Perch or 
Bull Pouts, gives occasion for hearty laughter.

5th. Brigade line was formed at 7 o clock this morning, in a 
pouring rain. General Orders directed the march of the entire 
Division into the city, to show full honors to the 5th Corps of 
the Army of the Potomac as it passed through the streets of 
Richmond, on its march to Washington. We had made about 
half the distance, when an Orderly delivered orders for our 
return to camp ; the ceremony having been postponed on account 
of the storm. We were as wet as drowned rats, long before we 
reached home. 

Our picket detail has been relieved by one from the 2d Brig 
ade. Coming in with our party was a goodly number of Rebel 
officers and men. These, like all who have previously come in, 
profess great satisfaction at the close of hostilities, and accept 
the situation with great good humor. 

Capt. Chauncey, of ours, who has been in Rebel hands, and 
for the greater part of the time since his capture at Newmarket, 
in prison at Macon, Georgia, returned to us to-day. It is use 
less to say that his reception was a hearty one. Poor fellow ! 
his appearance showed, louder than words could tell, that his lot 
had been a hard one ; and his tale of suffering and privation, of 
exposure and ill usage, wrung tears from all eyes. He con 
firmed the reports previously received by us, that he, with Lieut. 
Ammidon, of our " C," and other officers, were removed to 



IN RICHMOND. 401 

Charleston, S. C., and placed under the fire of our Batteries 
while engaged in shelling that city. He also certified to the 
death of Lieut. Ammidon, from small-pox, contracted while thus 
confined in that city. 

7th. Yesterday, at 6.45 A. 31., the men of the Brigade stood 
again in line, and soon after were en route to the city, which 
Avas reached at 8. The purpose was, as before, to pay the well 
deserved honors of a full salute to the Veterans of Meade s 
Army as they made their triumphal march through this city. 
Our Brigade drew up in line, fronting the City Hall, upon the 
broad steps of which Generals Meade, Meigs and others, with 
Chief of Staff Halleck, were seated, surrounded by their respec 
tive Staff Officers. In the rear, but a little to our right, was 
the Capitol of the late Confederacy. Here we stood, all the long 
day, in the burning sun, while the bronzed veterans moved by 
to the music of our assembled Bands. Each Chief of Division, 
and each battered standard received the full honor of dipped 
flags and presented arms : while, ever and anon, as the well 
known form of some favorite officer was seen, the air resounded 
with hearty cheers. Most of the Brigades were led by Colo 
nels or Lieutenant Colonels, and some of them, and many of 
the Regiments were under the command of Captains. The 
men looked and marched splendidly, .and the display was impos 
ing. The Artillery was in small force ; and the Cavalry, espe 
cially" weak in numbers. The poor fellows of the Infantry 
suffered much from heat and dust, and a good many " fell out " 
by the way. We were glad to welcome and grasp the hands of 
our former comrades and old friends, Surgeons Smith and 
Thorndike, with whom we exchanged hurried and hasty 
greeting. 

The sidewalks were thronged with negroes of both sexes, 
whose rows of gleaming ivory attested their unalloyed joy. 
Crowds of Union soldiers, off duty, cheered lustily at intervals. 
There was a " right smart chance " of rebel uniforms in the 
crowd, the wearers of which, to all seeming, were not the least 
interested spectators of the pageant. Here and there a female 
form was visible ; but in every instance it was that of some 
Northern woman engaged as a nurse in some Hospital, or 



402 THTBTY-FOUKTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

enlisted in the service of the Sanitary Commission. Among 
these last, many of us of the 34th were glad to see and welcome 
the Misses Chase, of Worcester. More than one parched tongue 
was refreshed by the drop of cool water provided by their 
kindness. It was past 4 P. M., when we received the welome 
order of dismissal ; and an hour later, when tired, dirty, heated 
arid hungry we broke ranks in our own encampment. 

llfA. Custer s Division of Sheridan s Cavalry, passed through 
the city yesterday, on its way to Washington. Riding by the 
side of the General was his wife, who both rode and looked as 
if herself every inch a trooper. 

Four Corps of Sherman s army are lying in and around 
Manchester ; on the opposite side of the River. The work of 
re-clothing that entire command is going actively on. These 
troops are to make their formal entry into, and passage through 
this City, on the fifteenth. At least such is the present pro 
gramme. The orders for which, just promulgated, direct the 
troops of that command to " show proper respect to the Chief 
of Staff of the Army," as they pass his quarters. In view of the 
sharp correspondence which has lately passed between these 
high functionaries, it will be interesting to note the proprieties 
of the occasion, as the column moves past the home of the 
officer in question. 

Headquarters was highly honored to-day by the presence of a 
party, under escort of, and introduced by our friend Dr. Clarke, 
as " the two Misses Chase, and three other ladies from Massa 
chusetts." The interview lost nothing of pleasure from our 
not knowing the names of our fair visitors. 

15/i. Gen. Gibbon, our Corps Commander, honored our 
camp by a close personal inspection of it to-day ; at the close of 
which, an order, looking to the comfort of the rank and file 
of the command, was promulgated by his authority. This order 
directed the tearing down of certain designated buildings, from 
which the men could procure material to floor their tents. In 
what sharp contrast this, to those orders from Superior Head 
quarters at Harper s Ferry, which directed the arrest of the 
occupants of any tent in which a board could be found ; and 
which would have consigned to the Guard House the entire 



IN RICHMOND. 403 

command, had not notice been given of the required search, 
and time allowed for the judicious shortening of all boards in 
camp. 

We have been buried beneath the avalanche of orders made 
necessary by our expected near muster out. Now, as pleasant 
relief to the dull formality of these orders, has come a furious 
interchange of billet doux, between Clarke, Surgeon in Chief 
and Acting Medical Director on Division Staff, and Assistant 
Surgeon Allen, Acting Chief Medical Officer on Regimental 
Staff. In filling out the papers necessary for the discharge of 
our disabled men, it is required that the nature, extent, and 
cause of the disability should be particularly set forth ; and 
Allen, in making out such papers, indulges himself in the use 
of such expressions as u shot by a lousy Rebel at New Market," 
or elsewhere, as the place might have been. Now, however 
much Allen may think he is warranted by the fact, Clarke 
considers the use of such expressions unbecoming in an official 
paper, if not disrespectful ; and, in the exercise of his authority, 
endorses upon them " Respectfully returned ; the attention of 
Assistant Surgeon Allen is called to the unwarranted expres 
sions used by him ; he will confine himself to the statement of 
bare facts in the case, in making out and forwarding papers for 
the discharge of enlisted men." Allen insists that, as he is 
required to certify to the fact of the man s disability, and his 
opinion of its cause, he can discharge his duty in no way 
different from the one he has adopted ; while Clarke, using his 
old time formula, tells him " to continue the same " at his peril. 
Meantime, we lookers-on, foreseeing in the dim distance greater 
demand for coffee than for pistols for the two, enjoy the affair 
immensely. But it is no joking matter for the Orderlies ; as, 
unless some compromise is speedily affected, we shan t have 
enough to bear despatches between the Headquarters of the 
respective commands. 

~L5th to 26th. Orders from Washington have been received 
at Corps Headquarters which direct the immediate preparation 
of all papers necessary for our muster out; and we learn, 
unofficially, that the 34th is the first organization in the 
Corps to be discharged. Quartermaster Howland has been 



404 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

despatched to Norfolk to bring up all our books and papers ; 
they having been sent there for safe keeping, at the opening of 
this Spring s campaign. And, now our joy is turned into grief, 
and we are overwhelmed with mortification, at the announce 
ment that one of our men, C- - G , of " E," is a prisoner 

in Castle Thunder, 011 a charge of larceny. Upon the repre 
sentation of Col. Lincoln, made to Gen. Ord, commanding 
department, so soon as the fact of arrest was known to him, 
G s release from imprisonment was ordered. Thereupon the 
Provost Marshal General, by whose officers G. was arrested, 
demanded an investigation of all the facts of the case. By 
order from Department Headquarters, this investigation was 
directed to be made by Gen. Turner, commanding the Division, 
who honored Col. Lincoln by charging him with the duty of 
ascertaining and reporting the facts in the case. It appeared, 

upon enquiry, that G , upon returning from the city a few 

days previously, fell in with an old, ill-conditioned horse, loose, 
and grazing by the wayside, but a little distance from our 
camp. Mindful of the comfort to be derived on a march from 
having an animal on which to pack one s baggage, instead of 

being one s self a pack-horse, G caught the animal, led it 

into camp, and turned it out to graze within the lines of our 
sentinels. He set up no claim to the animal, nor attempted in 
any way to conceal its presence in camp. And for this, Gen. 
Patrick s officers, without enquiring into the character of the 
man, or into the circumstances connected with the presence of 
the horse in camp, without so much as saying to the Regimental 

or Brigade Commander, " by your leave, sir," hurried G 

from camp, to the comforts and safe keeping of this old and 
filthy Rebel prison. True he was not long in custody ; but 
it was none the less an outrage that he was in custody at all. 
Report of the foregoing was duly made ; and Brigade orders 
were issued directing the arrest of any one who, in future, should 
attempt the arrest of any man of the command, within the 
limits of the brigade, without the knowledge of the Colonel 

commanding. G s freedom was not again interfered with. 

We shall have to leave behind all men recruited in 1863; 
our order for muster out excluding all men whose period 



IN RICHMOND. 405 

of enlistment extends beyond October next. We are ordered to 
transfer these recruits to a regiment from Illinois, forming part of 
the 2d Brigade, our Division, against which order a remonstrance 
has been forwarded, and request made that they may be trans" 
ferred to the Massachusetts 24th, in which request Col. Ord- 
way, commanding that regiment, has joined. 

Capts. Willard and Belser, and Lieut. Blake, are desirous of 
remaining in the military service of the country; and have given 
notice of their intention to avail themselves of the provisions of 
the order, upon that subject, just issued by the War Department. 

2bth to June 1st. We were agreeably surprised to-day by a 
visit from Col. Ivers Philips, of Worcester, whose interest in us, 
and our welfare, was shown by his walking from the city to our 
camp, in a driving rain. 

Col. Wetherell, of Gov. Andrew s staff, also honored us with a 
call. 

We are, as we have been for some time, busied in completing 
the papers, and making other necessary arrangements requisite 
to our being mustered out. Our rolls have been diminished 
this month by more than sixty men, by death, discharge, and 
transfer to the Veteran Reserve Corps. And now that we are 
ready and almost prepared to cast off all that pertains to military 
life, down comes an order directing the entire command to be 
re-clothed, even to the extent of new uniforms. It is difficult to 
understand the reason of such order, beyond the fact that it 
indicates a series of inspections and reviews. 

This month s muster roll shows present for duty, seven 
teen officers, and five on extra or daily duty; nine absent on 
detached duty; one absent sick. Of the enlisted men, two 
hundred and ninety-eight are present for duty, forty-seven on 
daily or extra duty, fourteen sick. Absent on detached service, 
one hundred and ten ; with leave twenty-six ; without leave 
eight ; sick, one hundred and fifty-three ; in arrest, two ; and 
prisoners of war, twenty-nine. The regiment has lost by dis 
charge, on account of disability, one officer and nineteen men; 
by order, eight men. Ten men have been transferred; three lost 
by death, from wounds ; and twenty-three by disease, 
30 



406 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Col. Lincoln still commands the Brigade, and Capt. Willard 
the Regiment. 

Capt. Willard is on Court Martial duty. 

Lieut. Cobb has resigned, and his resignation has been 
accepted. 

Lieut. Col. and Brevet Col. Potter is serving on Military 
Commission in the City of Richmond. 

We learn, much to our gratification, that we are to be soon 
discharged; that we are to be mustered out in this city; and 
that we are to receive our final pay and discharge papers at 
Readville, or Galloup s Island, which is quite as much to our dis 
gust. We have hoped that we should be discharged on the 
ground where we were mustered in; and efforts are being made 
to get such modification of our orders, as will admit of our 
going to, and through the City of Worcester, if we cannot be 
discharged there.

WALSH OF A GENERAL ORDERS 24 TH ARMY CORPS 
u MUSTER OUT." 

June 1st to oth. Our muster out waits only for the comple 
tion of their rolls, by company commanders. 

Orders, Adjutant General s office, Commonwealth of Massa 
chusetts, require commanders of regiments, to forward recom 
mendations for promotion to all existing vacancies in their 
commands ; said recommendations, in all cases, to be governed 
by considerations which would rule, provided the commands 
were to be continued in service. 

By orders from this military department, Regimental Com 
manders are directed to prepare lists of officers who have 
" particularly distinguished themselves for bravery and military 
qualities," and forward them through brigade, division, and 
corps Headquarters ; the commanding officers of each of which 
will append their respective comments. Brigade and division 
commanders are required, in like manner, to report upon their 
respective staff officers. As if this were not enough, there is 
also to be organized in each division, an Examining Board ; 
which board is to be charged with examining and reporting 
upon the qualifications of such officers, in the volunteer force, 
as may desire to remain in the military service of the country. 
This, with the ulterior view of their appointment to commis 
sions in the regular army. 

General Orders, Independent Division, appoint to this board 



408 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Col. and Acting Brig. Gen. Wm. S. Lincoln, 34th Massachu 
setts, President ; Lieut. Col. Titus, commanding 116th Ohio ; 
Major R. R. Clarke, Surgeon 34th Massachusetts, Surgeon 
in Chief, and Acting Medical Director Independent Division 
24th army corps ; and Capt. Frank T. Leach 34th Massachu 
setts ; all from our brigade, and all but one from our own 
regiment. The duty will be delicate, and the work somewhat 
arduous, as many officers in the division have already applied 
to be examined, hoping to be continued in the service ; one, a 
Col., expressing a strong desire to be retained, " providing he 
can remain with the rank he now holds." This, considering 
Gen. Turner, who commands our division, holds only a Capt. s 
commission in the regular service, is pretty good. 

Orders from Corps Headquarters directed a review of the 
Division, by Gen. Gibbon, on the first instant ; but these were 
countermanded on receipt of proclamation designating that day 
as a day of National fasting. The ceremony actually came off 
on the third instant. All three Brigades passed in column of 
Companies, before General Gibbon, Corps Commander, who was 
attended by the commanders of the other Divisions, and Gen. s 
Potter, and Curtis, of Fort Fisher fame. As we wheeled into 
line, an aide-de-camp brought orders for the 1st (our) Brigade 
to pass again, this time at a double quick ; while the other two 
were dismissed, arid ordered to their quarters. All were loud 
in commendation of the appearance of the Brigade ; especially 
complimenting our own regiment. "A fine regiment," said 
Gen. Gibbon, " and shows the close attention paid to it in its 
early days." " A fine regiment, indeed," said Gen. Potter, "and 
I envy you, Colonel, the taking it home." Our " muster out," or 
rather the preparations for it, seem to have come to a stand ; 
partly because of an insufficient supply of the required blank 
forms, and partly, perhaps, by reason of the receipt of orders 
from the War Department, which direct the careful examination, 
by a competent Board, of every officer, in the different com 
mands of the army. 

We learn, by an announcement from Division Headquarters, 
that it is now determined that the 34th is to be mustered out 
last of all the regiments which constitute the Division. This, 



RICHMOND AND MUSTER OUT. 409 

we conjecture, is because a majority of the clerks and orderlies, 
besides a goodly number of the General Staff at those Head 
quarters, are detailed from our regiment. 

Heavy and frequent rains, with intense heat by day, and cool 
and damp weather by night, have caused considerable addition 
to our number of " sick in quarters." Fortunately we have no 
serious sickness among us as yet. 

8th. The Board of Officers charged with examining such 
officers as desire to be continued in the service, visited our 
camp to-day in discharge of their duty. The regular drill was 
suspended; but the men were under Capts. Willard and Belser 
to enable those officers to show their tact in drilling Company, 
and Battalion. Everything went off well. Leaving our camp, 
the Board visited that of the th Virginia, to examine Colonel 
and Acting Brigadier H y, of that Regiment. Head- 
quarter s guard was found marching his beat, bare-footed, in 
shirt sleeves, with his pants rolled up to his knees, and his 
suspenders hanging from his shoulders, well down his back. 
The Colonel himself was mounted, and leading his men, back 
ward and forward, across a neighboring field. Being asked to 
get his men into a certain specified position, " What order 
shall I issue ? " he asked ; and being informed that that was a 
matter for his determination, " Oh, well," he replied, " I can 
give the necessary order, but I want my Battalion to appear 
well, and I have never put them through the specified move 
ment." The result of a whole afternoon s labor was entirely 
lost, if it failed to convince him that he had a great deal to 
learn in the school, even of the Company. It is said that upon 
an examination, upon matters not purely military, he betrayed 
an ignorance hardly conceivable ; placing New Jersey among 
the New England States; unable to determine in what State 
the Hudson River was ; or to name those which bounded on the 
Atlantic Ocean ; was ignorant of the number of pounds which 
made a ton ; and answered that a bushel of corn weighed fourteen 
pounds, and a bushel of oats twelve pounds. For any apparent 
errors, he apologized, by saying that he feared he might be a 
little rusty, as it was some years since he had graduated from 
(William and Mary) College ; a fear which was converted into 
certainty, as the examination progressed. 



410 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

~LQth. An order came down yesterday, directing a review of 
the 24th Corps for this afternoon. Division line was ordered 
for 4i; Brigade for 4i ; and Regimental for 4 o clock P. M. 
Our distance from the field on which the ceremony was to have 
been had, w r as six long miles; the route being over the roads 
into and through the city, and, far beyond on the other side. 
To-day has been intensely hot, and the sky unclouded. About 
3 P. M. a dense mass of heavy black clouds, fast rising in the 
west, gave warning of both wind and rain. To us inferiors in 
rank, this gave unmistakable sign that no review would be had. 
But it had been ordered, and our duty was to be on the ground. 
So with a wise shake of the head, and a rather reluctant step, 
we started, warming to our work as we got fairly on the road. 
Long before the ground was reached, the storm burst upon us in 
terrible fury. Heavens ! how the wind did blow ! and how the 
rain did pour ! Soon after we halted 011 the field, the Acting 
Brigadier and Staff rode up ; and, under his command, we halted 
at our designated position in line, at three minutes past the hour 
mentioned in Brigade order. But of all the troops composing 
the Corps, our own Brigade was the only one to put in an 
appearance, on the field. We held our place in line till past 5 
o clock, when an Aid of Gen. Gibbon rode up and announced 
the indefinite postponement of the ceremony. We should have 
received the announcement with as much cheerfulness, if it had 
been made before we were so thoroughly drenched. As it was, 
Brigade line was dismissed; a faint cheer was given; and eacli 
command made the best of its way to its OAVH encampment. 

\\th. It is officially announced, that at this Review, when 
ever it shall come off, bronze medals, awarded by the Depart 
ment at Washington, are to be given to enlisted men dis 
tinguished for gallant conduct in the last campaign: four 
coming to our Brigade, and two to men of our own Regiment. 

It is also given out that the order transferring our recruits to 
the Regiment from Illinois, is to be countermanded, and they 
are to be incorporated with the 24th Massachusetts, now serv 
ing as Provost Guard in this city. It is understood, also, that 
Capts. Willard and Macomber, and Lieuts. Belser and Horton, 
are to remain with them. 



RICHMOND AND MUSTER OUT. 411 

Lieut. Hall has been ordered to take charge of our rolls, and 
deliver them to the proper officer. To facilitate our final pay 
ment and discharge, he is to be despatched to " Readville," in 
advance of the Regiment. 

And now, when every man was anxiously counting the hours 
which must elapse before he received his final discharge from a 
service which he has helped render immortal, occurred one of 
those acts of insubordination, which, while bringing temporary 
discredit upon the command, is attended with serious injury 
only to the party immediately concerned. 

Our own Regimental discipline has always been rigid; the 
esprit de corps of the command, admirable. At all times, and 
in all places, our reputation has been enviable ; and since our 
encampment in this city, in Division General Orders which 
censured irregularities in other Brigades, the men composing 
the first Brigade have been excepted from rebuke. 

In order that our men might gratify their natural desire to 
inspect whatever was of interest in Richmond, passes have been 
issued, by which they could go freely to and from the city. 
Brigade orders, however, forbid any man leaving the limits of 
the command unless provided with such pass ; prohibited spend 
ing the night out of camp on any pretense ; and announced that 
trial by court martial would follow any violation of the order. 
And to enforce the observance of the order, a Patrol was estab 
lished, and the order directed to be read at the head of each 
company, at retreat, daily. 

Now, this evening, directly after the reading of the order in 
question, private Perry, of F, serving as Provost Guard at Brig 
ade Headquarters, threw off his equipments, and went out on a 
little reconnoisance, on his own account. Unfortunately for 
him, his scouting was directly in the path of this patrol, into 
whose hands he fell. The result to him was arrest, charges, 
trial, and the promulgation, this morning, of " Special Orders, 
Headquarters Independent Division, 24th Army Corps, announ 
cing the approval of the General commanding, of the findings 
and sentence of the court martial before which he was tried : 
which is, that " he be dishonorably discharged the service, with 
loss of all pay due, and final bounty." 



412 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS USTFANTRY. 



Orders came down after retreat this evening, announc 
ing a review of the Corps, by Gen. Ord, for to-morrow, " rain 
or shine ; " and it looks sure to rain. Well ! if only the 
reviewing officers share the water with us ! 

We are all made sad by the announcement, to-night, of the 
almost certain fate of Walsh, of "A," who, poor fellow ! lies 
now in the hospital, near to death. How singular his case ! 
While the regiment was lying at Fort Lyon, he was accidentally 
shot, supposed mortally, the ball penetrating his abdomen. He 
recovered ; went through the service of 63, and the campaign 
of 64 in which he was once or twice wounded ; and now, at 
the very instant of being discharged, is stricken down by 
disease, with hardly a possibility of living more than a day or 
two. 

V&th 9 P. M. We are all pretty well tired thoroughly 
drenched ; some not a little cross, and a good deal disgusted ; 
and yet pleased and gratified at the general result of to-day s 
proceedings. 

The review came off as ordered brass bands warned us to 
"see the conquering hero comes!" drums were ruffled 
arms presented colors dipped at the bidding of commanding 
officers ; and, to crown all, the men, at the request of Gen. 
Turner and others, and to gratify Madame, the wife of the 
reviewing officer, gave three lusty cheers to Gen. Ord, as he 
rode down the line in review. Although the rain came down 
as never before in our experience in this region, it " held up" 
and the sun shed his brightest beams upon the troops, during 
the actual review. There was less of that tiresome waiting, 
which, although not laid down in the books as a necessary, 
always is an incidental accompaniment of such ceremony. The 
column looked and marched splendidly. The appearance and 
bearing of the 34th drew words of praise from more than one 
general officer. Having completed their "march in review," 
the troops were drawn up, forming three sides of a square, that 
all might witness the ceremony of presenting the bronze medals 
to the men deemed most worthy of receiving them. Two of 
ours, Hunter of E, and Gardner of K, were made both proud 
and happy by receiving these testimonials to their bravery and

gallantry. As a little squint-eyed corporal of another com 
mand stepped forward in answer to the call of his name, and 
stood, covered with blushes, while Madame, wife of the review 
ing officer, pinned to his breast the coveted medal, we could 
hardly control ourselves at hearing the General himself admon 
ish him " always to wear it, and guard it sacredly as a precious 
heir-loom to your (his) ancestors I mean your posterity 
and if you have not got any, take my advice and go right to 
work and get some." 

Previous to the dismissal of the troops the following was 
issued : 

"HEADQUARTERS 24TH ARMY CORPS, 
"REVIEW GROUND, 

"RICHMOND, VA., June 13, 1865. 

" SOLDIERS OF THE 24TH CORPS : 

" This probably is the last occasion in which you, as a corps, 
" will be assembled. Many of you are about to re-enter civil 
" life ; to resume those domestic duties, which, by your service 
" to the great cause of your country, have been so long neglected. 
" Before we separate, 1 desire to thank you, in the name of a 
" grateful country, for the service you have rendered her. By 
"your discipline, long marches, and hard fighting, you have 
" established for generations a name second to none in the army. 
" Your badge has become an emblem of valor and patriotism, 
" and is a source of just pride to all who wear it. 

" Those of you who are entering civil life should still wear it, 
" on all occasions, as an evidence to your brothers who remain 
" in the service, of your pride in a badge made sacred by the 
" blood of so many men, and of your disposition, should your 
" country ever again call you to arms, to again assemble under 
" that proud emblem, and revive the glory of the 24th Corps. 

" To our comrades who are leaving the service we pledge a 
4 kind farewell, and a wish that their career in civil life may be 
44 as successful and prosperous as their military life has been, 

" alike honorable to themselves and beneficial to their country.

TER OUR DISCHARGE. 



Brigade Headquarters were broken up yesterday, 
immediately upon the muster out of the 116th Ohio; and to-day, 
our own regiment was paraded and subjected to the same 
ceremony. At the close of the formal proceedings, the Colonel 
commanding was served with an order, directing him to march, 
with his command, at 5 A. M. to-morrow, for Readville ; where 
final payment is to be made, and the men to receive their 
discharge papers. Lieut. Hall, who is charged with the custody 
of our muster out rolls and records, and wlio was to have been 
despatched in advance, is now directed to accompany the com 
mand. We must march, leaving poor Walsh, who is but just 
alive, here in hospital. 

16A to 2lst. Our bugles roused us at an early hour on the 
morning of the 16th, and soon after, in heavy marching order, 
with our haversacks filled to overflowing with our three days 
rations, we moved on our homeward way. Reaching the city, 
we halted long enough to leave, at the Headquarters of the 24th 
Massachusetts, our recruits, who, organized into two companies, 
under the temporary command of Capt. Macomber and Lieut. 
Horton, were ordered to be transferred to that regiment ; and 
resuming our march, we soon reached "Rockett s," where we took

boat for Baltimore. Steaming down the James, passing Drury s 
Bluff, Dutch Gap canal, which looked like nothing but a deep 
ditch cut through dry land, and the many points made famous 
in this long struggle for the control of the river, and the pos 
session of Richmond, past City Point, and Fortress Munroe, 
out on to the broad bosom of the Chesapeake, through the 
waters of the Patapsco, and by the walls of Fort McHenry, we 
entered the city of Baltimore, in the early forenoon of the 17th. 
Here, a short delay was rendered unavoidable by the necessity 
of procuring, from the Post Quartermaster, orders for our 
further transportation. It was a pleasant surprise for us to find 
that our application was to be made to, and our orders to be 
received from our warm friend and old time comrade, Maj. 
Bowman, now on duty as such officer. Furnished with the 
needed authority, we lost no time in taking the cars provided for 
us, and were soon again on our Avay. Not now, however, as in 
those days of 62, met with averted head, and scowling face, but 
everywhere greeted with hearty cheers. A rapid run carried 
us to Philadelphia, which was reached as the morning sun was 
breaking through the fog, and smoke, and haze, which lay 
heavily upon the city ; and to the regular, but monotonous tap, 
tap, of our drums, we marched to the Cooper Shop Refreshment 
Saloon, where a warm breakfast awaited our coming. Almost 
three years had passed since such a temptation had been placed 
in our way, and then on this very spot ! But the boys were 
equal to the emergency. No words can describe the vigor of 
their first attack, nor the steady and dogged perseverance with 
Avhich they continued their assault upon the tables. Not a soul 
faltered ; and at the close of the repast, looking down the long 
table, we had to mourn that for once we had been unequal to 
the demands made upon us. 

The bugles soon sounded to the color, and we reluctantly 
turned to leave. But the employees of the Quartermaster s 
department were looking, among our horses, for animals which 
the Government, from former ownership, might now lay claim 
to. All such, or at least all believed to be such, had been 
turned over, previous to our leaving Richmond. But alas, for 
our brave, warm hearted, guileless, old Surgeon ! While in the 



416 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

valley, lie had traded his own undeniably private horse, with 
one of Sheridan s troopers. There would have been no trouble, 
if the Dr. had been contented with his first trade ; when he got 
a nice mare, stolen to be sure, in all probability, from some 
secesh farmer, but to which the Government, at least, could lay 
no title. But when in course of time, and because of embar 
rassment resulting from a whinnying colt, jogging along at his 
heels, the Dr. allowed himself to be seduced into trading with 
another trooper, he paved the way for his final loss. His new 
purchase bore the fatal " U. S." branded upon its shoulder. 
There were not wanting rogues among us, who advised him to 
set up the claim, that the fatal letters were the initials of Uriah 
Saunders, a noted breeder of horses, living in the valley ; and 
perhaps certificates to the fact could have been procured. But 
like the Father of his country, the Dr. "couldn t tell a lie;" and 
he parted with commendable grace, though reluctantly, with 
the faithful old animal, which had born him safely on the weary 
marches of the past year s campaigning. This impediment to 
our progress being removed, we embarked and were whirled 
swiftly along on our journey. Our run to New York was 
without noticable incident. Disembarking in the early after 
noon, we were conducted to Battery barracks, where we were 
comfortably quartered. In the temporary absence of Col. 
Howe, our own State military agent, the regiment was gener 
ously treated to a bountiful feast of strawberries, by 

military agent of the State of New York. 

The first person to extend greeting to us was Hon. D. Waldo 
Lincoln, Mayor of the City of Worcester; who, in the hope 
that our homeward route would include that City, had come on 
to give us welcome. He brought with him the National Flag 
presented to the regiment, by the ladies of that City, just pre 
vious to our departure for the seat of war ; and which we had 
exchanged, at their request, for the one we had borne through 
this Spring s campaign. Every possible effort was now made to 
secure our further transportation by the Worcester route ; that 
all might enjoy the public reception ready for us at home. An 
offer was made to defray any difference in cost of transporta 
tion, and a guaranty that there should be no material variance 



JOURNEY HOME AND DISCHARGE. 417 

in the time of arrival at Readville, if allowed to change our 
route. All efforts to this end, though warmly seconded by Col. 
Howe, who had now reached the city, and who was indefatigable 
in ministering to our wants, were of no avail. The harmoni 
ous working of the Quartermaster s Department teemed to 
require that the waters of Providence, rather than New Lon 
don Harbor, should be plowed by the keel of our transport 
boat. The comfort of the men, and the gratification of their 
pride, alike natural and praiseworthy, was of little comparative 
consequence. And yet, by the orders of this same Quarter 
master, our stay in New York was prolonged for more than a 
day. Its irksomeness was measurably relieved by attentions 
shown us by warm and Sympathizing friends, who in many 
ways contributed to make our enforced stay a pleasant one. 

At length marching orders came; and on the afternoon of the 
19th, in the dying glory of an unclouded sky through streets 
thronged with applauding citizens beneath flags gayly wav 
ing from windows and house-tops amid the discharge of can 
non, and the acclamations of the multitude, we made our slow 
progress through the city. It was an ovation which stirred the 
heart of every man in the command, and brought tears to the 
eyes of many a battle-scarred veteran. There was no delay in 
our embarkation or departure. Providence was reached at an 
early hour the next morning, and marching by the shortest 
route to the depot, paying to Maj.-Gen. Burnside the honor of a 
marching salute as we passed his residence, we took our seats 
for this last stage of our journey. Noon found us at Readville. 
Upon reporting to Maj. Gen. Pierce, commanding, quarters 
were assigned us in camp. Other Regiments had preceded us. 
Theoretically these were all occupying tents in camp; practically, 
the camp was deserted, hardly a man in uniform being visible. 
Oar discharge was to await the final payment and discharge of 
all troops, whose arrival at the rendezvous was prior to our 
own; and this payment awaited the leisure or the pleasure of the 
Paymasters. It was a dreary look for men, many of whom had 
not seen the face of a relative, for nigh three years, and all of 
whom, now at least, were anxious once again to put on citizen s 
dress. There was little information to be obtained at Post 



418 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Headquarters. So, Regimental General Orders directed the 
immediate turning over, to the proper officers of the Post, all arms 
and equipments, and camp and garrison equipage, everything, 
in fact, for which any officer was accountable. This done, we 
had neither arms, with which to do guard duty, instruments 
on which to sound a call, or utensils with which to cook a ration; 
in fact, we were paupers. What was now to be done? To remain 
in a camp which all other commands had vacated, when in sight 
of our own hearth stones, to eat the rations of the Government, 
when our own home bread was prepared for us, longer to wear 
the blue, when now that there was no farther occasion for our 
service it galled our backs, were questions which came up 
and pressed for answer. They were all solved by dismissing 
the regiment, to assemble again at the call of its commander. 
At the order, like bees swarming from their hive, the boys 
rushed from the camp ground, and hurrying to a train just 
drawing up at the station, took their seats for Boston. 

Here, at the station of the Boston & Albany Road, new 
trouble awaited us. The Government had provided transpor 
tation for us only to Readville. Hardly one of us had a cent of 
money. Upon representing our condition to the president of 
the corporation, upon our promise that his road should be 
reimbursed, whenever we should be paid off, he kindly fur 
nished passage to our respective homes. 

The Regiment left the State on the 15th day of August, 1862, 
with an aggregate strength of 1022 men. Three hundred and 
eight (308) recruits joined our ranks during our service.

July 6th. The regiment assembled at Readville to-day, in 
obedience to regimental general order, published in the news 
papers. At the call of his name, each man responded and 
received his final pay, seventy-five dollars, the balance of 
Government Bounty promised at his enlistment, and his dis 
charge papers ; having served, within twenty-five days, his full 
term of three years. There was one notable exception, however, 
in the case of John E. Calligan. This man enlisted as a member 
of- Company E ; was at once appointed a Sergeant, and detailed 
as color bearer. For gallant conduct at New Market, he was 
promoted to a 2d Lieutenancy, vice Robert W. Walker, reported 
killed. Walker, however, was wounded and taken prisoner 
instead of being killed. Notwithstanding, Calligan was assigned 
to duty as 2d Lieutenant, and served as such, receiving his 
commission in July following. 



420 THIRTY-FOURTH MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY. 

Why he was not mustered in as 2d Lieutenant does not 
appear ; as he served in such capacity until the engagement on 
the 13th of October following, when he was taken prisoner. 
The apparent negligence is hard to be accounted for ; as during 
all this period he was borne upon the rolls as an officer. Of 
course from the time of his promotion to the line, he ceased to 
draw rations or clothing, as an enlisted man. In March, 1865, 
having been exchanged, he was recommended for and received 
a commission as 1st Lieutenant ; but his muster to that rank 
was refused o n the ground that his company was so reduced in 
numbers, as not to be entitled to such officer. He served in 
his new rank however. And now, when there was no time to 
remedy the error, the Government ignored both his commission 
and his service and discharged him as Sergeant; paying him as 
an enlisted man only, and refusing every allowance for the 
rations, and clothing, during the time he had provided them 
from his own resources. Powerless to help, his associates could 
only extend to him their sympathy under such gross injustice. 

With the receipt of their discharge papers, the men ceased 
to be in the service of the country, and with hurried adieus, 
each went his separate way. So the 34th passed to history. 

It remained only that the white flag of the State, entrusted 
to our keeping, should be returned to the Executive of the 
Commonwealth. Its tattered remnants were endeared to us by 
the sad but glorious memories of New Market, and Piedmont, 
and Lynchburg; of Winchester, and Fisher s Hill, .and Cedar 
Creek; of Hatcher s Run, and Fort Gregg; of High Bridge, and 
Appomatox Court House. It was sanctified to us by the blood 
of Bacon, and Woods, and Walker, and Thompson, and Pratt, 
and Dempsey, and Wells, and all the other heroic dead of the 
command. Unsullied as when first committed to our keeping, 
it was given to the honored hands of him from whom we 
received it. 

And now that this work is to be given to the public, justice 
requires that proper acknowledgment should be made to the 
medical officers of the staff of the value of their services. Dr. 
R. R. Clarke, originally commissioned as Surgeon, was, for our 
whole term, in the immediate charge, or had the close super- 



, JOURNEY HOME AND DISCHARGE. 421 

vision of our Hospitals. He was subjected to much abuse while 
the Regiment was being organized, abuse entirely uncalled 
for and undeserved, yet it was to his good judgment and 
skill as a Physician, at this time, as well as afterward to his 
unwearied devotion to the sick and wounded and his unre 
mitting zeal and fidelity to the well-being of the men of the 
command, at all times and in all places that much very 
much of its efficiency was due. And this is equally applicable 
to his Assistants Thorndike and Smith each of whom received 
promotions, in reward for faithful service and Allen and Mil- 
lard, who came to us at a later day, but who, nevertheless, ren 
dered invaluable service. 

Arid so of the Quartermaster s Department ! Howland went 
out and came back with us as a plain Regimental Quartermas 
ter; although at different times and for long periods he 
served in the same capacity on Brigade Staff. Few Regiments 
were served as well as none better than our own ; and this 
whether in the field or garrison in camp or 011 the march. 

Of the manner in which the duties of the Adjutant s office 
was discharged, too much cannot be said in praise ; more 
especially when Woods filled the position. Always affable 
easily approached accomplished both as gentleman and officer, 
master of the duties of his office, he won the love and respect 
of his associates, and the regard and admiration of those to 
whose staff he was detailed. Fortunate very fortunate 
indeed, was the . Regiment in its Staff, both Commissioned and 
Non-Commissioned.

IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE 



LIEUT. COLONEL LINCOLN. 



THE close of the 15th of May, 1864, left me, with many of my companions in 
arms, wounded and in the hands of the enemy. We had marched, the day before, a 
distance of twenty-one miles in seven hours, with hut one halt, and that of only ten 
minutes. Now the sun had sent down his fiercest rays, now the clouds had poured 
their contents, in torrents, upon our devoted heads. Tired, wet through, and hungry, 
for we had not a morsel to eat with us, in the thick darkness of the overhanging 
woods, we lai&lt;J down, in line of battle, upon our arms. Twice the vollies of musketry 
from opposing parties on our left had caused us to spring up in line; and again, we had 
been roused, before dawn, by our own officers, and held in readiness for any move 
ment which might be made. Later on in the morning, we had passed hours in 
marching and countermarching for position, and still later had met the attack of the 
enemy, and after a sharp and severe fight, had been badly beaten. As the day 
closed, some sixty of us found ourselves stretched in and around an old barn, near the 
battlefield, closely guarded by Rebel soldiers. During the early hours of the evening, 
and well into the night, our party received accessions from such wounded Union 
soldiers as were able to make their way unaided ; or, too severely wounded to walk, 
were brought in by the enemy. Occasionally, by the light of a lantern, some Rebel 
officer would examine us. " Are there any Confederate wounded here ? " was asked 
by Major Meem, Medical Director on the staff of Gen. Breckenb ridge, as he stood at 
the head of a goodly sized party of Rebel surgeons. No answer was returned by any 

of us, as the question was addressed to no one in particular. "I say, you d d 

Yankee sons of b s, are there any Confederate wounded here?" "No, sir !" was 

the reply. "Then this is no place for us, gentlemen! " said the Major; and he turned 
away. Among the wounded was Capt. Graham of the 54th Pennsylvania. He had 
been shot directly through the right lung, and each breath he drew sent the air 
lohistling through the wound, disturbing the dying, who laid near. "I wish, Major," 
said I to Meem, "you would give a look to this officer, before you go." " We ve got 
enough to do to attend to the confederate wounded," said he; but spite of the remark 
turned to comply with the request. As he drew the shirt from the wound in the 

Captain s breast, he broke out with " All he wants is a d d good horn of whiskey," 

and walked off. All his companions followed, save one, (I wish I knew and could 
give his name), who, lingering behind, closed the wound with a piece of plaster, and 
gave him to drink from a jug in the hands of an Orderly. 

With the morning light we were able to recognize, and enquire as to each others 
condition. Another night passed, with the addition of a few more to our number, 
among whom was Capt. Fox of ours, from whom we learned of the death of Capt, 
Bacon, of our color company. 



2 IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE. 

Late in the afternoon of this day (Tuesday), with an armed Rebel on each side of us, 
Capt. Fox and myself made a slow march into town, and to the office of the Provost 
Marshal. Here our names and rank were registered, and we were directed to report 
ourselves at the hospital. At this place our wounds were examined and partially 
dressed; a thick slice of bread (the only food which either of us had had since Sunday 
morning), was given to each, and we were told that we might " look out for ourselves" 
till we were wanted. We procured lodgings at the Village hotel, where we staid till 
Thursday, when we were informed that we \vere wanted again at the hospital. 
Reporting, we found drawn up before the door of the building a long wagon, without 
cover, without springs, with no seat, and not even straw upon which to sit or lie, into 
which we were directed to get, as we were to be sent, in this way, to Harrison burg, 
some twenty miles away. We were now joined by Lieut. Ammidon, of ours, who 
had been captured, but fortunately not wounded. Our journey was a sad and tire 
some one. But it had an end; and late in the afternoon, when our teams stopped in 
the middle of the main street of Harrisonburg, opposite the Court House, we stepped 
down and out, at the invitation of our guard. It was a curious coincidence, that here, 
as on the battlefield, the first question asked me by the guard was the ivliispered one, 
"Are you a Mason?" In the light of subsequent experience, I can t help thinking 
that I should have fared better, while a prisoner, if I could have answered this 
question in the affirmative. Here we took a sad farewell of Ammidon, who was at 
once hurried on further south to Andersonville, and his death. We were now escorted 
to the hospital which was established in the buildings of the Academy, at the out 
skirts of the town, and reporting to the Surgeon, were by him ordered to report to the 
officer in charge of prisoners at the Court House. Entering, we were warmly greeted 
by Lieut. Walker and some forty or fifty of our own wounded men who had preceded 
us. We were assigned to the upper story of the building. There was the bare floor to 
sleep on; no straw was furnished us. Our blankets, tin cups, canteens, indeed every 
thing of the kind had previously been taken from us. Three times a day, coffee, 
bread and sheep meat, as the Rebel soldiers called it, cut in cubes about two by two, 
were brought us. It so happened that my place on the floor, was next the door, as 
the room was entered. The coffee was brought in a large water pail, a small tin cup 
floating in it, from which we were to drink. As the bearer entered, he turned to me. 
Filling the cup I put it to my lips, to take it away again with my thirst unquenched. 
My lips were blistered by the boiling liquid. And when, after going the rounds of 
the room, the soldier was at the door, on his way out, I reached again for the cup, I 
was met with the pleasant remark, " Let that alone, you ve had your chance before." 
And so it happened always. We had many visitors, most of them apparently coming 
to see how we looked, as they exchanged no words with us. Some came, however, 
from interest in the cause for which we suffered ; or drawn by sympathy for us, on 
account of our wounds. Among the latter was a Mrs. Lewis, wife of a prominent 
merchant in the place, whose kindness of heart overbalanced the contempt in which 
she held the "myrmidons of the Tyrant Lincoln," and who furnished to many of us 
supplies from her own table as long as we remained in the Court House. Among the 
former was Col. Asa S. Gray, and his daughter, Miss Orra Gray, staunch lovers of 
the Union, both of them; ministering angels in our hours of despondency, of want, 
of suffering, and of death! To their unwearied attention, and unstinted supply of 
whatever they could procure, which in any way would contribute to our welfare, all of 
us were indebted for comfort, and some of us for restored health and life. Dr. 
George H. Gilmer, a physician of the town, not only visited us, but attended to our 
wounds, till the arrival of Dr. Allen, assistant Surgeon on the Staff of the 34th 
regiment; and in other ways did much to relieve us. Capt. McNiel, too, old 
Guerilla that he was, called often, and showed us much kindness, after his fashion. 
" Have you written home, Colonel? " asked he one day. " Yes, Captain ! " " How 



LTETT. COL. L1XCOLX. 3 

did you send your letter?" "By way of Richmond and flag of truce boat." 
" Pshaw! " said he, " your folks will never hear from you by that route! Here," said 
he, " here is some paper; I see you ve got pen and ink; write a letter if you want to; 
pay for a Confederate Post Office stamp, I must make you contribute that much to 
our cause, give me your word that you won t write anything you ought not to seal it 
up and eive it to me and I ll put it into one of your post offices for you, though, 
mind, I don t promise that 1 won t rob it first" He was as good as his word; and, 
of all the letters written home by me while a prisoner, all of which were forwarded via 
Richmond and flag of truce boat, this one was the only one which reached its destina 
tion. Major Meem too, called occasionally. Once, before our surgeon came up, as he 
entered the room, I asked him if he would not look at a little fellow of ours, whose 
wrist was terribly shattered by a Minie ball. "I suppose you wan t I should look at 
you, too! Why the devil didn t you leave one of your own surgeons to take care of 
you?" said he: but the little fellow had already taken off his handkerchief, and held 
out his wrist, swollen, mangled, and of a dark, deep red color. "Erysipelas there, 
Major, isn t there?" "Yes." "His arm will have to be amputated, won t it?" 
"Yes." " Won t you operate?" "We can t be troubled with your men, Colonel! 
we ve got our hands full with our own," said the Major, as he turned and walked 
away. So life went on with us; till, on the afternoon of the 25th, ten days after the 
battle, we were gladdened by the arrival of Dr. Allen, one of our own surgeons, who 
had come up to take care of our wounds. Finding that we were packed too closely, he 
at once applied himself to securing other and more airy, and comfortable quarters; and 
having effected our removal, set about examining our wounds. The little fellow, 
whose wrist was so badly shattered, and whose arm Major Meem had at a later day 
amputated, was among the first to receive attention. Upon removing the bandage 
from the stump, the bone was found to project three and one-half inches beyond the 
"flap : " this, by actual measurement. Was this accidental? or was it in furtherance 
of the interest, as explained below, in the case of Ryan, whose left knee joint was 
shattered badly, and who now was low and sinking. " This man," said Dr. Allen to 
Major Meem, "ought to have had his leg amputated immediately after being 
wounded." " Yes!" said the Major, "I thought so." "You saw him, then? " "Oh 
yes!" "Well, why didn t you operate?" "Oh, Doctor!" was the reply, "you 
know its for our interest to kill all your men we can" and the conversation ended. 

After Dr. Allen s arrival, and before he had removed us to our new quarters, and 
while he was temporarily absent, from the Court House, an ambulance was driven up, 
and a guard, getting out, announced that "Col. Lincoln, Capt. Fox, Capt. Graham, 
and Lieut. Walker would take seats in it," as they were about to be started off South. 
To hear was to obey. In the effort to comply with the order, Lieut. Walker fainted, 
before he had reached the ground floor ; Col. Lincoln managed to get down, and part 
way to the ambulance; while the two Captains succeeded in reaching and taking 
their seats in the vehicle. At this stage in the movement, Dr. Allen made his appear 
ance. In much excitement, he remonstrated at the cruelty of the order; and obtained 
a promise of delay, till he could find the proper authorities, and remonstrate against 
its execution. He might as well have whistled against the wind, for all the effect he 
produced. The order had been issued, and would not be countermanded. Dis 
couraged, he was returning, when he accidentally met Major Hunter Johnson, Acting 
Post Quartermaster, who hearing his representation that the removal of Col. Lincoln 
and Lieut. Walker would .greatly endanger their lives, took the responsibility of 
countermanding the order, so far as those officers were concerned. He could not save 
the two Captains, however, and they were driven away. The days dragged their 
slow length along. Nothing but an occasional death varied the monotony of our life ; 
till one morning we were visited by a rebel officer, who asked us for our parole. We 
demurred, till, upon his solemn assurance that there was no Union force nearer than 



4 IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE. 

Cedar Creek, and at present, not the most remote possibility of our being recaptured, 
we yielded, and gave the required pledge. The next day, however, Hunter, with his 
army, marched into town! Before marching away, he visited the hospital cheered 
us by his promise, that, upon reaching Stanton, he would send down a train with 
ambulances enough to take us all to Martinsburg ; and left with us liberal supplies of 
flour, coffee, tea, sugar, &c., morphine, quinine, chloroform, stimulants and other 
medicines, and bandages sufficient for our wants. He left a large supply of all 
these articles for the rebel wounded, of whom there were more than two hundred in 
town. He left also clothing, stockings, uniforms and boots for all of our men. He 
had hardly gone, before the hospital was entered by a party of soldiers, headed by a 
man in rebel uniform, who gave his name as Capt. Jourdan of Rosser s command, 
and who robbed it of all the liquors, all the morphine, quinine, and chloroform ice 
had; all the coffee, sugar, and tea they could carry off; each man taking one and some 
two suits of uniforms, and one or more pairs of boots. Days passed; and as with 
their passage, without the appearance of the train promised by Hunter, hope of 
speedy liberation fled, some of our men lost courage, drooped, and died ! 

We were denied the privilege of burying our dead in the village cemetery ; and it 
was only by the persevering energy of Miss Gray, that permission was given us to 
deposit their remains in the long disused graveyard belonging to the Methodist 
society of the town. 

In the absence of any better astringent, Allen sent out the nurses to cut down the 
only wild cherry tree we knew of; and to dig up, and bring in the roots of blackberry 
bushes, of which to make tea. 

The Rebel authorities, who had&gt; run off at Hunter s approach, now returned, and 
resumed control. To our surprise, and indignation, we found that a guard was again 
stationed over us. We demanded its removal. Maj. Johnson replied that the ques 
tion of the validity of our parole had been referred to Richmond for determination. 
He removed the guard, till he should be informed of the decision. Meanwhile, Early 
came down the valley with his army; and the guard was replaced over us. 

In consequence, a note was written and sent to Maj. Johnson, Acting Post Com 
mandant, setting forth that our paroles were valid, or of no binding force; that if 
valid, there was neither propriety or right in keeping us under guard; that if they 
were deemed invalid, we had no cause of complaint: but, that unless the guard was 
withdrawn, we should consider ourselves discharged from the obligations which the 
parole imposed. Although no reply was made to our note, the guard was continued 
over the hospital, and we left to draw our own inferences from such continuance. 

During this period, occasionally one or more of our wounded, now convalescent, 
made their escape from the hospital in the village. No attempt at escape was made at 
our own, however. Maj. Meem, at this time, re-appeared in the village. With his 
return, an effort was made to send away such of us as were well enough to bear the 
journey south. The means of transportation were limited, however". If the regular 
stage coach, from Winchester and below, came up empty, they would load in fourteen 
of us ; if it was filled with passengers, our party would have to wait a more con 
venient season for their journey. Up to this time it had been left to Dr. Allen to 
determine who must go : he being directed only as to the number to be sent. But 
now Allen announced that he had orders to send off the next day, fourteen of us ; 
" and Colonel," said he, " you are named as one to be ready. I told Major Meem," 
said Allen, "that you were in no condition to travel yet, and he is coming up to see 
you, and judge for himself." And so we were prepared when he made his appearance 
that morning. " Pshaw! " said he, as he replaced my shirt, after making his exami 
nation, " Why in hell don t you get well, Colonel! I reckon you don t try very hard, 
do you? But you ll have to go! Don t you think now, you could take the journey if it 
was to your home?" "I d try to, Major," was my reply. "Well, this is to Rich- 



LIEUT. COL. LINCOLN. 5 

mond! " "By the way of Lynchburg? as Capt. Fox went," asked I. "How did 
you know anything ahout that?" "Oh! I didn t dream it." "Well, get well!" 
said he, " we ll let you off this time, but we can t keep you here forever, you know." 
" I don t want to stay that long," I replied, and the subject was dropped. " By the way 
Allen," he rejoined, "did you get your whiskey, to-day?" This, in allusion to the 
fact, that since Rosser s captain had robbed the hospital of every thing of the kind, he 
(Meem) had undertaken to supply us with what was needed. "I got what you sent 
me, Major!" said Allen, "but its queer whiskey 7 Lincoln here, had rather take his 
quinine clear, than in that stuff" "Where is it? get a tumbler, and let s try it," 
said the Major. He did so: not once only, but twice, and not by tasting merely, but 
by drinking, till he emptied one of the two bottles he had filled for our sick. He left 
us after a while, much to my relief, if to that of no one else. My respite was short 
however: for not many days afterward, upon Allen s return from the lower hospital, 
he again announced, that he was ordered to get another party ready to be sent away, 
and that I was again included among those to go. As before, so now, Major Meem 
was to come up, in the evening, to examine my condition for himself. 

Allen, Lieut. Walker, and myself, Avere the only occupants of one of the rooms, and as 
the Doctor left to make up his list of those best able to bear the journey, I made known 
to Walker, (who, poor fellow! was on crutches and could not go), my determination of 
trying to effect my escape that night. He tried to dissuade me, on the ground that, 
weak as I was from my wounds and long confinement, I could not possibly succeed. 
But I felt that if I could get beyond the guards, I could manage it some how. Of course, 
I placed my chief reliance upon the aid I confidently expected to receive from any 
negroes I should meet on my way; and preferred the risk incurred in the attempt, to 
the entertainment which would be furnished me at any of the rebel prisons farther 
South. So I cast about for a companion, and calling Snow, of our G, to my side, 
made known my plans, and sent him out with some money, to hunt up the "Old 
Auntie " who had done our washing, and get from her some suits of clothes with 
which to disguise ourselves. He returned, having procured for himself, only, the suit 
required. While he was gone, I had enlisted another recruit, in the person of 
Doherty, a man of the 54th Pennsylvania. Snow was again despatched, with 
instructions to tell the old "mammy " what I intended to do; and also that she must 
send me a suit of her "old man s" clothes; no matter how ragged; and get him to 
meet us that night, at a spot designated, to guide us on our way. I had enquired of 
our visitors, at different times, as carefully as possible, of the direction of the different 
roads in sight from the hospital; the nature- of the country, and the character and 
disposition of the people along each route; and now pitched upon the road leading by 
Rawley Springs, through Pendleton County, to Beverly, within the Union lines, as 
the most safe to be taken. But we wanted a guide at any rate, till we were fairly in 
the mountains. Snow s second attempt resulted in his bringing in a complete suit of 
well worn Grey for Doherty: an old white hat, minus crown and part of its brim, for 
me; and a promise from the old negress, that her husband should go to the rendezvous 
agreed upon, that night, and wait for us; and should take with him a suit of old 
clothes for me to wear. 

So we waited with comparative composure for the appearance of Major Meem. He 
came at last; bringing with him a Dr. King, also a rebel surgeon. They examined 
me thoroughly, but gave no intimation of the opinion they reached, The Major dis 
cussed his whiskey as before; and between drinks, indulged in reminiscences of his 
life, while studying his profession at the Northern colleges, and confessed to having 
had many a good time among the Yankees. "Do you know, Colonel, how much 
pleasure it would give me to dine with you at your own home?" he asked. " How I 
should like, Major, to extend an invitation to you now, if I could only fix upon a 
particular day," was my reply. " Well," said he laughing, "it does look as if there 



6 IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE. 

was a little difficulty about that, doesn t it?" "By the way, Allen," said he, 
" Haven t you got a pair of boots for me? mine are almost gone !" " I m afraid," 
said Allen, " I ve none that will fit you. There are none left smaller than nines, and 

you wear" "fives," said the Major ; "but we can t be too nice about the fit!" So 

Snow was directed to bring in a pair. Meem literally stepped into them, they were so 
large, but nevertheless was pleased : so much so that he insisted that King should also 
have a pair, and Allen sent for another one, which gave equal satisfaction, though 
none the less a misfit. Still they kept their seats! What else did they want? I was 
becoming nervous: now wondering whether Snow had not been careless, and now 
whether the old "Auntie " had not been treacherous, when Meem got up, and taking 
me by the hand, and wishing me a pleasant journey, went away with his friend King 
and their new loves, the Boots. Allen now closed the hospital, and crawled between 
his blankets; and, contrary to his usual custom, laid still, and almost instantly fell 
asleep. Nothing broke the quiet that settled down upon us, save an occasional snore 
from some heavy sleeper, or the measured tread of the sentinels around the building 
in which we were confined. We had planned to attempt our escape at as early an 
hour as possible. To aid it, one of our fellows, good singer, and capital story teller that 
he was (he had lost a leg and could not travel), volunteered to go out by the front door, 
and entertain the guard, in the hope that the sentinels, stopping occasionally to listen, 
would get irregular on their beats, and thus give us a chance to slip from the back of 
the building, between them. Another comrade, on his bunk at a back window, was to 
give a low whistle when the coast was clear. Close to the rear of the hospital was a 
small shed, which was to be the first step of our flight; a little way beyond was a 
board fence, our second step; while beyoud, and till we reached the cover of the corn 
field, all was open to observation. Well in among the growing corn was the white oak 
tree agreed upon as the place of rendezvous. Doherty was to try his luck first, I next, 
and Snow was to follow last. Warned by Allen s low and regular breathing that he 
was asleep, I got up carefully, and, giving Walker s hand a hearty grasp as I passed 
him, left the room. My appearance was the signal for the others to set about their 
work. Almost instantly we heard the rich voice of our one-legged comrade, as he 
charmed our friends, the guards. With but little intervals the low whistle of our 
other friend was heard, and Doherty slipped out! I soon followed, and with but lit 
tle delay gained the rendezvous, where I found Doherty. Snow soon joined us. But 
there was no guide! What should we do? Snow and Doherty in their suits of home 
spun grey were capitally disguised ; but for myself, if once seen in our own blue, de 
tection and capture was almost sure. Still, I was the most unwilling to remain where 
we were. With the directions which Dr. Gilmer (to whom late in the afternoon I had 
confided my intention of trying to escape) had given me, I felt confident of finding the 
house of a negro, in whom we could trust ; and, finding him, of obtaining somehow, 
whatever disguise was necessary for my wants. But Snow was so confident that our 
guide would soon make his appearance that he absolutely refused to move from the 
spot. So, with an injunction to him not to wait a great while, Doherty and I left him, 
and made our way up to a corner of the field, abutting upon a piece of wood-land, 
where we could better conceal ourselves. While waiting somewhat impatiently for 
Snow to join us, we were startled by a musket shot, from the direction of the hospital ; 
quickly followed by loud talking, and the sound of horses in quick gallop along the 
road near us. Had our escape been so soon discovered? Why is not Snow alarmed? 
and what keeps him from joining us? were questions each asked of the other. Every 
minute of waiting seemed an age ; and after much urging, Doherty consented to go 
down, keeping covered by the fence, with a message to Snow to join us immediately. 
In his absence, I fancied the voices were getting nearer and nearer, and was much 
relieved by the hurried tread of Doherty, who came up with the story that beneath the 
tree where we had left Snow he had caught sight of from six to eif/ht persons, who 



LIEUT. COL. LINCOLN. 



were talking loud and angrily together. I may as well say here, what I afterward 
learned from Snow, (who, tired of waiting, attempted to find us, and failing in that, 
succeeded in making his way back into the hospital again, from which, at a later day, 
he succeeded in escaping, ) that the shot which so alarmed us was an accidental one, 
from a falling stack ; that the loud talking we heard was in a detachment of Cavalry 
men on their way down the pike to join Early sarmy ; and that at no time in the night, 
after we left, was there anybody but himself under the tree. But this we did not then 
know ; and jumping to the conclusion that our escape had been discovered, and Snow 
already retaken, we also came to the conclusion, that our only hope of final escape laid 
in immediate flight. So we struck across the fields in a southerly direction, under 
cover of woods wherever practicable. Our plan was to reach the road which led, via 
Rawley Springs, to Beverley, in our lines ; traveling by a line paralell to it, through 
the yields and woods, as far as possible. Dr. Gilmer, who alone of all my new made 
friends, knew of my intention to escape, had given some general directions as to the 
route, and also, the names of one or two persons whom I could safely trust, provided, 
(and there was the difficulty) I could succeed in reaching their houses. We continued 
our way, crossing one or two roads, which we left, because not answering the descrip 
tion of the one we were in search of. Morning came upon us, literally wanderers in 
a strange land. If we could only have found a "little cabin inhabited by a negro 
family, with a wheelwright s shop, by the banks of a little creek," we should have 
found safe hiding place, something to eat, and faithful guide on our way ! ! As it was 
however, we hunted for, and found some thick underbrush, under cover of which we 
laid down and slept. Voices, in loud conversation, woke us late in the morning ; 
but, satisfied that we were well screened, we took another nap ! By noon we were 
awake again. We now held a long consultation ; but as we did not know where we 
loere ; as it was not safe to attempt to move while it was light ; and as we were both 
dry and hungry, it was thought best to get another nap, if possible. We did not wake 
again till near sundown ! To while away the time, Doherty cut and trimmed a good 
hickory stick for each of us ; while I laid still, husbanding what strength I had, 
for our coming night s march. My wound was very painful ; and though / suffered 
much from thirst, Doherty professed to want nothing but food. Each of us was 
supported by the hope that we should yet find the house which had been fixed upon, 
as our refuge, after our first night s travel ; (wherein dwelt our much needed guide 
across the mountains,) and which we hoped Snow might have reached ; and when it 
was dusk, we left our cover, and with undiminished courage resumed our tramp, still 
keeping the direction of our previous night s route. vVe carefully felt among the 
stubble of a large wheat-field in our way, for any chance heads of grain with which to 
satisfy our hunger ; and we quarrelled with an old sow for the possession of a stagnant 
pool, in which she was peacefully reclining, that we might satisfy our thirst. Here 
we held council again. Looking south-west over the town, from our place of confine 
ment in Harrisonburg, a solitary hill, sugar-loaf in shape, rose high above the sur 
rounding country. From the information we had, we ought, upon looking to our rear 
to have seen this hill on our right, but we did see it on our left ; and we were forced 
to the conclusion, that, by some mistake, we had crossed the road which led to the 
Springs. It had been represented as widely laid out, thrown up in turnpike shape, and 
pretty well travelled. So, taking another drink, (it didn t taste so ivell this time) we 
turned our faces northward, and kept on till we came to a road, which, in the belief 
that it was the one we sought, we followed for a while under some of the pines by its 
side. This seemed to run out into a mere wood s path, when we left it, and keeping 
still more to the north, across the fields, soon came out into another road, along which 
we kept till the morning light warned us to take to the mountains, and hide. Hunger, 
and thirst, and anxiety as to our whereabouts prevented sleep ; and crawling beneath 
the shelter of some thick underbrush, we spent the day in watching the farm-houses 



IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE. 



which dotted the plain below, in hopes of catching sight of some "contraband." A t 
times, we speculated as to what had become of Snow, and what effect our escape had 
had on the fate of our comrades left at Harrisonburg. The sight of Rebel Cavalrymen 
near, riding from house to house below us, and holding short colloquy with the inmates 
of each, did not add to our peace. Our day watch came to an end at last; and at dusk, 
flanking the houses at our feet, we descended the mountain for the purpose of obtain 
ing food, and, if possible, information as to our whereabouts. Our watch of the day 
had shown us that the house near by had no inmates, save the aged and grey-headed 
couple, who had responded to the calls of the Rebel horsemen during the day. 

Of course, dressed as I was in my own proper uniform, save that a private s blouse had 
been substituted for the regulation coat ; with my arm confined, and useless, by reason 
of my wound, it was not prudent for me to show myself. So Doherty left me seated 
with my back to a stone wall, and went up to the house alone. He soon rejoined me, 
having in one hand a pitcher of milk, and in the other two slices of bread, which we 
attacked without ceremony. The old man had followed Doherty, unperceived ; and 
now, while we were eating, reached over the wall and placed his hands on my shoulder. 
" Who are you ? Where do you come from ? Where are you going ? and what are 
" you doing here, at this time of night," he asked. Too many questions to answer at 
once; so he was told merely that we were Conscripts, on our way to report at Harrison- 
burg, to the Rebel commandant. There had been a late conscription ; and all con 
scripts had been ordered to report the day after we left. " You ought to have reported 
"yesterday." "Yes! but we lost pur way in crossing the mountains !" "Where 
"did you come from?" "Moorfield." "How did you pass the picket at Brock s 
" Gap ? " "We wa n t challenged ! " "That s strange ! " There was a good deal 
of like questioning and answer ; the result of it being to give us the information that 
we were on the road to "Brock s Gap," instead of "Rawley Springs," and that 
we were only nine miles from Harrisonburg. Having eaten our supper, we rose 
and followed the man as far as his house, on the toay to Harrisonburg. Here we 
exchanged with him a pleasant good night, and continued our way in apparent uncon 
cern. But, so soon as we were fairly screened from his observation, we retraced our 
steps. Having re-passed his house, we sat down to discuss our situation. Here we 
were, on a road we knew to be a very dangerous one, for ( McNeil s company was at 
"Moorfield,") and parties of his men were continually passing between that place and 
Harrisonburg. Besides, while prisoners, in conversation with our guards, as well as 
those well disposed toward us, we had learned that in many respects an unsafe road to 
take. Still I could not make up my mind to turn back, in search of another route. 
My feet were already very sore, and inflamed, and I dreaded any increase of travel. 

At length, with much difficulty, I persuaded Doherty it was best to keep on. It was 
nearly morning when we neared the entrance to the Gap. We were walking after the 
fashion of the country, Doherty leading a few paces, when, at a turn in the road, I 
caught sight of the light of a picket fire, which Doherty had not seemed to notice. My 
low whistle, or the snapping of a twig, upon which Doherty had incautiously stepped, 
attracted attention ; and a sharp who goes there," followed. We each threw ourselves 
upon the ground, close to the bushes which lined the road, and after a little delay, 
crawled through the brush to the river bank, (the Shenandoah) plunged into the water, 
which we forded somehow ; and, climbing the mountain, hid in a thick clump of 
evergreens. Here we passed the next day undisturbed. Heavy clouds gathered in 
the afternoon sky, but we started at dusk, in spite of the rain which had begun to fall . 
At the foot of the mountain, we found a creek running across our way . We forded it 
safely, carefully feeling the way with our canes, and sat down on its bank to empty the 
water from our boots, and wring it out of our stockings. We had not finished, when 
the tread of horses feet, and rattlir/g of sabres, warned us of near danger. How my 
heart beat, as the foremost rider pulled up his horse, (a step farther and he would have 



LIEUT. COL. LINCOLN. 

been actually upon me,) to settle with his companion the dispute between them, 
whether or not they were at the Ford. Fortunately for us they concluded that it was 
at a point lower down the creek, and reining round their horses, they rode away. Of 
course we moved as soon as they were fairly off ; and after a little waiting, every 
thing being still, put on our boots, and walked away. But a new trouble met us soon 
after. We came to where the road forked. In the darkness of the night we could 
hardly see a hand before us ; so, kneeling, we tried, by careful feeling of the road, to 
ascertain which was the most traveled, meaning to take it. But we could not satisfy 
ourselves, and concluded to hide again and wait for the morning. So we climbed the 
mountain, and laid down to rest and sleep. It was late when we woke, cold and stiff, 
and of course wet through, for it was raining hard, as it had all the night long. All 
day we watched the roads in sight, hoping that some of McNeil s men would pass, and 
so we be able to select our route; for we had now determined to make for " Romney " 
and " Moorefield," and our lines at " Cumberland." Late in the afternoon, it having 
cleared away, we descended the mountain part way, and hid in a thick clump of laurel 
bushes, almost directly over the road. After long waiting and watching, we caught 
sight of two Rebel soldiers, slowly riding toward Harrisonburg ; and as they passed, 
heard : " Well, they can t be on this road, for the Colonel was never out of. the hospi 
tal till the night he got away ; and he could not have traveled so far ; and recog 
nized in one of the party, a soldier who had been guard over us for weeks. 

We knew now that we had been pursued; and that our pursuers, on this road, unable 
to hear anything of us in advance, were returning, satisfied that we must have taken 
some other route. Of course we felt greatly relieved at what we had just seen and 
heard ; and waited, with a good deal of impatience, for the coming on of evening, that 
we might resume our journey. At near dusk we picked our way to the foot of the 
mountain, and soon after started. Our road wound up and round the side of the 
mountain ; it was narrow, bordered on each side by tall trees growing thickly together, 
which made it pretty dark ; and we trudged along with a good degree of confidence, 
greatly relieved by the knowledge that we were no longer being pursued. Once or 
twice, we stopped to consult at a divergent path, but were not tempted to wander from 
our better travelled road. Hours had passed, and we were still climbing ; the road 
had been gradually getting worse, and worse ; we occasionally stumbling over project 
ing roots, and stumps ; when, all at once, we stood on the summit of the mountain, 
face to face with the newly risen moon ! It should have been at our backs ! How had 
we gone astray ? and how far from our true route had we been led ? Alas ! there was 
no opportunity to enquire, if enquiry would have been safe ; and with feelings a good 
deal depressed, we turned to retrace our steps, carefully examining the way, as we 
walked on, to determine, if possible, at what point we had wandered. Morning broke 
upon us, while still upon our backward way ; and we went into the woods, for con 
cealment, a good deal dispirited. We were roused from sleep by the crowing of cocks, 
and the barking of dogs, in the door-yard of a house not far away ; and which had 
been unnoticed before. The clear notes of a bugle, sounding the reveill^&gt; drew our 
attention to a party of Rebel horsemen in another direction, who were engaged 
grooming their "cattle." We were almost in "the open," so far as this party was 
concerned ; and, digging our heels into the ground, slowly but carefully worked our 
selves, upon our backs, under cover. We watched anxiously the departure of these 
soldiers; and, relieved by their riding away, were amused later in the day, by observ 
ing the females and children of the family near us, as, with straight poles for flails, 
they kept hard at work pounding out their crop of wheat. Way off, in another 
direction, by itself, and apparently in the middle of a large field of grain, was a small, 
one-story house, at which we determined we would apply for food, when night should 



10 IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE. 



We felt gloomy enough ! My own condition called for all the nerve I was 
possessed of. My wound, from want of attention, was extremely painful, and besides, 
my feet were so badly swollen, and blistered, that I could hardly walk. In addition, 
I was weak from want of food, and suffering for water. Doherty, not having been 
wounded, was in better condition ; still he suffered a good deal. Notwithstanding all 
this, we started as soon as it was dark ; and going up to the house, Doherty obtained a 
couple of slices of bread, well-covered with apple butter, and, what he did not want so 
much, the company of the owner of the place, out to where I was seated. Of course it 
was natural that we should be questioned, and perhaps equally natural that we should 
not tell all the truth, or nothing but the truth. Again we passed ourselves off as Rebel 
soldiers, this time as returning from furlough ; and were not a little startled to find 
that we had been on the road to Franklin County. Professing to belong to Imboden s 
command, our friend kindly undertook to pilot us across the country, to a road which 
led to Winchester, where Imboden was. We followed him until we reached a road, 
which lie assured us led direct to Winchester ; thanked him for his kindness, and paid 
him for his bread, and left him. Now here was a dilemma ! If we did not want to go 
to " Franklin," neither did we wish to go to Winchester, which we had good reason to 
believe must now be occupied by Early and his army. Still, in the uncertainty of 
being able to find the road from which we had strayed in some unaccountable man 
ner, it seemed the best course to keep on. By keeping to the mountains, we believed 
we could avoid all the Rebel pickets ; and there would be but little more danger in 
taking this route, than the one by "Romney." True, if retaken, we should fare better 
at the hands of McNiel, than in the keeping of Mosby or Harry Gilmor. Besides, 
the distance to Martinsburg was less than to any point in our lines by way of Romney. 

So we accepted our new situation with comparative cheerfulness. Once in the course 
of the night, we were brought to a stand-still, by the apparent running out of the road, 
in the thick brush, at what appeared to be the bed of a mountain brook, now completely 
dried. On our hands and knees we felt, (for in the darkness we could see nothing) for 
the foot marks of horses, or fresh horse dung, which would be^, guide. But we failed 
to find either ; and after long hunting, came into a foot path, which gradually widened 
out and gave us a way of escape from the difficulty which threatened us. Warned by 
the coming daylight, we again hid on the mountain. After a sound sleep, we woke, 
and cautiously made our way through the woods to a point, from which we could 
plainly see what was going on in a farm house beneath. We were interested in watch 
ing the Rebel soldiers, who occasionally stopped on their way to chat with the young 
girls of the family, and in endeavoring to hear what was said. We heard enough to 
satisfy us that there had been a late battle between the two armies in the valley; but 
not enough to learn at what place it was fought, or which party were victors. 

Early in the afternoon, Doherty announced his determination of going to the house, 
for food. Although we could plainly enough see that there were no males about the 
house, I tried to dissuade him from venturing at any rate, while it was daylight ; 
but he declared he should die unless he had something to eat, and off he started. I 
was relieved at seeing him reach the house, make known his wants (as I well knew 
by seeing one of the girls go to the " spring house "), and leave with some bread in 
his hands. But I was equally disturbed when, as soon as he was fairly away, one of 
the girls sounded a conch, and I saw a man, who was cradling oats in a field not far 
off, start on a run for the house. Hurrying to meet Doherty, we climbed the moun 
tain, flanked the house, and, keeping under cover of the woods, continued our flight, 
till warned by the setting of the sun of the danger of again losing our way. 

Seating ourselves, each discussed his single slice of bread. Now, Doherty found 
leisure to tell the cause of his rapid retreat from the house. He had asked for a larger 
allowance of bread than was first given him ; and while incautiously asking his way,

and the distance to Winchester, one of the girls accused him of being a runaway 
prisoner from Harrisoriburg , and, in his confusion, he left without waiting for the 
additional supply he had asked for. But he learned that the road we had been 
traveling did not lead to Winchester. So we had lost our way again! Nothing 
daunted, however, we started as soon as it was dark. Morning saw us once more in 
hiding, with no house in sight. We slept pretty much through the day ; and were on 
our road again as soon as it was prudent to travel. It had now become very hard 
work for me to walk. Not only were the soles of my feet badly blistered, but the toes 
were much swollen and festered, and the nails of some of them had come off ; so that 
when day began to break, warning us to seek a hiding place, I felt really unable to 
climb so far as prudence dictated; and, entirely exhausted, threw myself down along 
side a fallen tree, in some underbrush, not half way up the mountain side. The 
violent barking of a hound which had found us out disturbed us. How mad I was as 
the whelp stood there, with glaring eyes and standing hair, regarding none of my 
coaxings! The voices of children crying out "Watch em, Brave!" the specula" 
tion as to what "Brave" had found; and the promise of the father, that, after 
breakfast, they would go up and see, admonished us of our imprudence. But flight, 
at the moment, would only make matters worse; so we laid quiet, in hope that 
" Brave " would soon tire of his barking watch as he did. When his yelping ceased, 
we rose, hurried to another part of the mountain, and, with a prayer for safety, laid 
down, and, after a while, slept soundly. In this manner, traveling by night, hiding 
by day, avoiding every house, except when driven to one by the pangs of hunger, we 
made our way for eleven successive nights; once becoming so hopelessly lost as to feel 
compelled, by very despair, to rouse the inmates of a farmhouse, to get directions as to 
our route. Fortunately, here again, the only occupants of the dwelling were aged 
people. The suspicion of the old man, who, in answer to our request, good-naturedly 
got up from his bed to put us on our way, was allayed by our telling him that we 
belonged to McNeil s command, and were in a hurry to get toMoorfield, as we had over 
stayed our leave of absence. "Then you don t want to go to Moorefield," said he, 
"for McNeil moved to Komney yesterday." "It s McNeil, and not Moorefield or 
Romney that we are after," said we ; and, changing his direction, the old fellow led 
us through the bushes, and putting us on a road, which he said led to Romney, forty 
miles distant, left us with a hearty wish for success. Our situation was thus much 
bettered. We not only knew where we were, but the distance between us and our 
lines at "Clear Spring," for which place we now determined to aim; but had the more 
important information that McNeil was directly in our path. Our progress had been, 
and must still necessarily be, slow; owing not only to my feeble condition, but also 
because the weather was intensely hot, and, owing to the drought, water seldom to be 
met with; and it was dangerous to ask for food. We had depended upon finding 
berries in plenty; and running across a contraband occasionally. But we had seen 
neither during any part of our journey. As for water, there was almost literally 
none. The bed of every stream was dry; and we came across no springs. Never 
shall I forget my feelings at seeing, one night, by the faint light of a just rising 
moon, the glimmer of water a short distance ahead of us! We made short work of 
reaching it, and driving out a hog, which .had made his bed in it! Sitting down, 
Doherty filled our canteen. It had been two nights and two days since either of us 
had had a drop to drink! I emptied the canteen at a draught! and Doherty, after 
filling it again, did the same ! We sat a while to rest and cool ourselves, for the night 
was exceeding hot. Before starting, we thought best to take another drink; but now 
both taste and smell were sickening! Neither of us could swallow a drop! But we 
filled the canteen, lest we should find no more, and started again. I am amused now, 
as I recall the calculations we made of our probable progress. Three nights more, and 
we should be safe beneath the "old flag " I The 54th Penn. had been stationed in the 



12 IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE. 



neighborhood of "Romney;" and Doherty claimed to know every cross-road and 
mountain path between that place and Clear Spring. Alas! how vain all our calcula 
tions proved! On our next night s travel we came. to a fork of the road which puzzled 
us. After reconnoitering a house near by, and finding it occupied by ivomtn only, 
we enquired of them, and learned that we were but eighteen miles from " Roinney " 
by either road; and that there was little choice between the two. 

Our route led up over the range which divided two valleys. The way was steep, and 
the latter part of it rough and uneven. I had been for some time anxious to stop for the 
night; when suddenly the loud baying of hounds warned us of our nearness to some 
house, and a step or two opened into a clearing, and showed us plainly to the gaze of its 
owner, standing at the just opened door of his cabin. It would only excite suspicion to 
retreat; so we boldly announced our desire to join McNeil at Eomney, expressing a 
fear that we had lost our true road. Sure enough, we had. The old man kindly gave 
us directions by which to regain our route, and, following them, we soon got out of his 
sight, when we took to the woods for concealment. It had been cloudy, which, per 
haps, was one cause of our going astray. At night we were again on the road, taking 
now the right, now the left hand path ; and in the morning laid ourselves down beside 
a fence in a thick piece of woods which bordered upon the roadside. A dense fog laid 
heavily upon the land, and hid from us a house standing but a short distance from our 
resting place. We were both so nearly exhausted, and our feet were so sore from 
repeated blisters, that we took no more steps than we felt to be absolutely necessary. 
Still, had not the fog so completely hid the house, we should not have dared to have 
laid down where we did. We had not slept, when we were roused by the dropping of 
a set of bars, the passing by of some cows, and a good-natured voice asking us what 
we were doing there. It was the same class of man we had encountered twice 
before old, gray -headed, long past his prime. There seemed to be no others in this 
country ! He was a Philadelphia lawyer for questions; some of which were hard to be 
evaded. Our old story, that we were McNeil s men, anxious to rejoin him, and 
traveling at night because we had overstayed our time of absence, seemed to satisfy 
him. He insisted upon our going to his house with him, which we did, thinking on 
the whole it would be safer to do so than to refuse. Seeing how difficult it was for us 
to walk, he became suspicious again at my explanation of blistered feet. " Why, yoxi 
soldiers ought to be toughened to it," said he. " You forget that we are mounted 
soldiers," said I. "That s so," said he. We each got a slice of bread of the old 
fellow, and learned that we had again lost our way, being now twenty-six miles from 
Romney, instead of eighteen, as two nights before. I am ashamed to say that I stole 
from the house a piece of bar soap, as a dressing for my sore and inflamed feet. I 
would have bought it; but I had nothing but greenbacks, and was afraid to show 
them. Leaving the old man and his aged partner, we took to the road again, and, as 
soon as hidden by the fog, took to the cover of the heavy timber. 

Never could anything afford greater relief than this soap gave, spread in thick slices 
over the raw spots on my feet! I slept nearly all day. At night we got along with no 
accident; and by morning came out on to the pike leading from Winchester to 
Romney, about five miles from the latter place. Here we begged a drink from a 
young girl who was milking by the roadside; and turned to the hill again for hiding. 

The day was spent in speculating as to the probable presence of McNeil at Romney; 
the danger of being seen by any of his scouting parties, or of falling upon any of his 
pickets; and my ability, if not interrupted, of walking the distance remaining before 
us during the coming night. Doherty repeated, over and over again, the fact of his 
intimate acquaintance with the surrounding country, and his perfect knowledge of all 
the mountain paths and roads in the neighborhood. So that at night we started with 
increased confidence of success. We traveled slowly, and with great care; stopping 
frequently to listen for any noise which would indicate the approach of any party, 



LIEUT. COL. LLXCOLX. 13 

and to peer through the darkness for the faintest glimpse of any picket fire. We had 
no cause for alarm till we came in sight of Romney ; but it seemed as if every house in 
that village was lighted up; and, after a moment for consultation, Doherty led the 
way across the fields, leaving the town well to the left I following as fast as my 
crippled condition would allow. Each of us had many, but no serious, falls, in this 
cross cut over the uneven country. We struck the road again about a mile and a half 
north and east of the town. It was necessary to do this; because, directly ahead, ran 
the south branch of the Potomac, which we must cross on the bridge which spanned 
it there, or be compelled to keep on along the mountains, for, we did not know how 
many more, days and nights. 

It was a night " as dark as Egypt," and we were tramping along, Doherty leading 
and I following as fast as I was able, when suddenly, from the darkness ahead, came 
the startling " halt! who comes there?" Before I could get up and interpose, Doherty 
answered "refugees." But to the next question I answered, giving my Christian 
and omitting my surname, as, on the whole, somewhat dangerous. To all the other 
questions, I answered with just the least grain of truth, drawing from the sentinel the 
somewhat doubtful " Well! I suppose it is all right, isn t it? " and in a confident tone 

my own " Yes, you d d fool, do you suppose we should be here, with McNeil just 

in front, if it was nt?" The sentinel (for such he was) made some reply, but in a 
tone of voice too low to be heard plainly. " Let s run," said Doherty. " No," said I, 
"He ll alarm the camp if we do; and there will be an end of me, if not of both of 
us." The sentinel s cross " what are you standing there for? " " are you going to keep 
me here all night?" admonished us, and we started towards him. It was too dark 
to enable either of us to see the other with any distinctness. Evidently, however, 
our new friend had some misgivings; for he joined us as we came up, and walked 
some distance, questioning us somewhat closely, particularly as to where we came 
from, and where going. As he left us to go back to his post, a most unaccountable 
noise, on our left, gave us new alarm; and it took some time and careful examination 
before we could determine that it came from a body of horses champing their rations 
of whole corn. A good deal relieved by this discovery, we came to the conclusion 
that the party had bivouacked in the woods, leaving a sentinel only on the road; and 
that we had successfully passed all danger. Doherty still wanted to take to the fields 
and run; but I wouldn t, for I couldn t; so we continued on the highway. A few 
steps brought us to a sharp turn of the road, where was a collection of long low build 
ings; among them a large barn. As we made the turn the scene which broke sud 
denly upon us, sent the blood curdling to our hearts, and almost completely paralyzed 
us. Directly in our front was a large mansion, brilliantly lighted from ground floor 
to garret, filled with a merry party of both sexes, enjoying themselves with music and 
dancing; while in the grounds around, groups of rebel soldiers, gathered about their 
camp fires, were busily engaged in cooking. Fortunately for us, we had not passed 
from the shade of the barn; and still more fortunately, the water, at some previous 
rains, had worn a gully across the road, at the very spot where our flight had been 
thus arrested. Instinctively we threw ourselves upon the ground, hardly daring to 
breath, fearing each moment that we might be discovered. The sentinel who had 
allowed us to pass, now rode by, and asked of one of his comrades if he had " seen any 
thing of two strange men." " I hain t seen nobody," was the reply. " Is that you, 
Bill? " was asked in turn. " Yes! " " Well, you d better go back to your post; for if 
the old man finds out you ve left it, you ll catch hell!" " Well, I don t know as I 
done right in letting them pass!" " No matter; they can t get out if they have got 
in;" and, comforted by this assurance, our friend rode back to his post. Soon the 
order to " fall in for supper " drew the whole party round the fires; and under cover of 
the darkness, caused by this movement, we crawled on our hands and knees across the 
road, in the gully in which we had been concealed, to what we thought a safe distance 
up the mountain side. We laid there a long while, listening anxiously for each sound 



14 IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE. 

from the party below. At length there was a lull in the music ; a heavy tread on the 
piazza floor, and a voice which was recognized at once as McNeil s, called " Sergeant 
Allen." "Aye, aye, Sir," responded the Sergeant. " Wake up Lieuts. Bradshaw 
and Scott, and then saddle." There were a few moments busy preparation; and then 
the same voice, with these preliminary words, "half-past four is the time, boys," 
gave the order to " march." It seemed an age after the command filed away, before 
all was quiet in and around the house. During all the time, no persons ever hugged 
the ground with a closer embrace than we did. The noise of closing doors at length 
satisfied us that everybody had left. We raised ourselves to a sitting position, and 
" which way did they go? " was asked by each of the other at the same time. One 
knew no more than the other; and in this uncertainty neither of us cared to move. 
Three miles ahead, upon our projected route, was a wire suspension bridge across the 
south branch of the Potomac; and McNeil, as we well knew, whichever way he went, 
was too wary a soldier to leave that unpicketed. There was nothing left for us, but 
abandoning all hope of escape that night, to take to the mountains again for safety. 
So we did ; and made our bed in earthworks thrown up in the first year of the war. 
Here we enjoyed a sound sleep. At daybreak, Doherty, looking out upon the valley 
below us, informed me that the large brick building at our feet, where the "sound of 
revelry by night" had so startled us, was upon an estate owned by a Mr. Inskip, a 
well-known rebel. "I know," said he, "every path across these mountains; have 
taken them thousands of times on my way to and from picket. There is a house a 
little way off, where we can get a good, square meal. I have had many a one in it; 
and I wan t to get on to Hanging Rock, (so called from its projecting partway 
over the pike beneath it) while it is light, and see if there is any picket on the bridge." 
I acknowledged that these were all good reasons, but still I told him I would not 
move; it was dangerous enough at night, as our last night s experience proved; it 
would be much more so in the day; and besides, after getting safely so far, I should 
feel ashamed enough to be caught, as it were, within sight of home. And to convince 
him that I was in earnest, I stretched myself out for another nap. When I awoke, 
Doherty resumed the subject, and after hesitating long, I consented to start. The 
movement came near being a fatal one for us, however; for all at once, without any 
thing to give us warning, we came out upon a clearing where young men the 
only ones we had seen on our whole tramp were engaged in mowing. As we came 
out from the woods, they caught sight of us, and dropping their scythes, made for 
their horses, which, saddled, were hitched to the fence. We dodged back to the pro 
tection of the woods, and bending to the right, hurried away as fast as we could. 
Whether they searched for us or not we could not tell. We kept on with all the speed 
we could muster, till in making our way down a mountain, we came to a deep gully, 
bordered on each side by high blackberry bushes, at the bottom of which ran a stream 
of beautifully clear water. We had now been out thirteen days, and had had but six 
slices of bread (each) to eat; and we had suffered more than lean tell for want of 
water. So we gave ourselves up to this indulgence; eat and drank, and drank and 
eat, till we could hold no more. With a parting sip, we turned away, having first 
filled our "canteen." We were now making our last climb before coming to " Hang 
ing Rock." " I thought you told me that there was but one or two houses about 
here," said I to Doherty. " So I did," said he. " What s all this noise then, of driv 
ing cattle?" asked I. He could not tell, and we made our way more slowly, and with 
greater caution. 

Just before sundown we reached the top of the mountain, made our way carefully 
to "Hanging Rock," from which we were to get a sight of the bridge, and, to our dismay 
saw that the flats near it, on both sides of the river, were filled with cattle, horses, and 
wagons, all within a line of Rebel sentinels. Evidently our situation was not a safe 
one: and we started at once in search of a secure hiding place, and, deeming ourselves 
safe from observtaion, laid down among some bushes. Hardly had we done so, when 



LIEUT. COL. LINCOLN. 15 



our attention was attracted by the sound of voices, and the tread of a picket guard, as 
it passed on its way to some point in our rear, higher up the mountain. It marched 
past so near, and we saw them so distinctly, it seemed impossible they should not see 
us. But, thank God ! they did not discover us ! So soon as they were out of hearing, 
crawling close to the ground, and stepping with the utmost care, we descended the 
mountain, and squeezed ourselves in between some huge rocks, whose sides rose far 
above our heads. From here we could catch a glimpse of the soldiers on the opposite 
side of the river, and could plainly hear what was said by those who passed on the 
road beneath us. In this way we learned that the party was McNeil s; which, having 
made a raid on "Oldtown," in Maryland, the night before, was now returning with 
their plunder. Feeling that we were safe, we moved the loose stones which interfered 
with our comfort, and resting our backs against the rocks, which hid us from observa 
tion, gave ourselves to sleep. 

Morning dawned, and showed us that this party was still encamped. Towards 
noon all had gone, save a party (a picket, probably), who, although not visible, we 
could hear conversing beneath us. Nothing disturbed us during the day or night. 
We were wakened the next morning by the sound of distant cannonading, which fell 
faintly but with perfect distinctness upon our ears. Doherty, who alone, from his 
service in this region, might have made something of it, could not locate it. Before 
long, a small party of Rebel Cavalry came in sight. Soon a larger party appeared, 
wounded men in carriages, supporting each other, or held up by comrades apparently 
unwounded, army wagons, pieces of artillery, ambulances, caissons, all mingled in 
confusion, and a party of mounted Infantry, each man having a large bundle of straw 
strapped behind him, and all urging their animals to a speed unusual on a march. 
What did it all mean? The sound of the cannonading, and the sight of the wounded 
men, plainly enough indicated that the party had been engaged. Which party was 
victorious was a matter of more concern to us; and we strained our ears to catch, if 
possible, some word which would relieve our anxiety. At length the voice of some 
one urging his horse along the road and past the confused mass, enquiring " Where s 
the General? Where s McCausland?" gave us a knowledge of whose the command 
was. The anxious enquiry by one, of " Where do you suppose Averill is?" was met 
by the taunting reply, "Don t you fret; you 11 see him as soon as you want to!" 
The question by one, " Where do you suppose McNeil is? " was answered by another, 
who gave the confident assurance that He promised he would tear up the railroad, 
and he never yet had disappointed them." All these things, and many others, were 
full of interest to us, but did little to relieve our anxiety. The column had passed by, 
and the perfect silence below and above us was leading to the belief that the pickets 
had been withdrawn, when the rapid tread, on the pike below, of a horse coming from 
the direction of Romney ; the sharp question, " Where are you going, Major?" and 
the reply, "Over to the other Brigade," drove from the minds of each of us all 
thoughts of further travel that night. We had learned at Harrisonburg, on the march 
of the Rebel army down the Valley, that McCausland was brigaded with Bradley 
Johnson; and now the inference was irresistible that the "other Brigade" was 
Johnson s probably at Springfield, across the river.. So another night s confinement 
was before us, and still longer acute suffering (for such it had now become) from 
hunger and thirst. With the early morning the rear guard of this force marched 
away, and all became silent as death. This silence was so long and unbroken, that 
Doherty urged our leaving at once. I refused to stir. " Look down there, Colonel," 
said he; pointing to a house on the flat below us; "I have eaten many a good meal at 
that house, and / shall die if I don t get something to eat right away. Come, now! 
We can t either of us stand this longer! Let s start!" But I refused, and urged 
him strongly to bear our condition till evening. It was to no purpose, however; and 
with a promise on his part to be very careful in making his way out from our hiding 
place, we shook hands, and, with a wish for mutual success, parted. Left thus alone, 



16 IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE. 



I was wondering whether I had not been foolish to consent to the separation, when 
Doherty s hurried return roused me. He had, while still within the protection of the 
woods, caught sight of the glimmer of the bayonets of a picket, on the mountain. 
He wasn t now so hungry as he had been! and, if only he had not been seen, was 
willing to stay in hiding as long as I pleased. 

AYe remained closely hid all day, nothing occurring which gave us any uneasiness. 
Late in the afternoon, a horseman jogged along below us, unchallenged. In the belief 
that our way was now clear, we crept from our hiding place, and cautiously made our 
way down the mountain, and skirted its base till we reached a point opposite the 
bridge. There was no picket stationed at it. But what seemed worse was the fact 
that its suspension wires had been thrown off their supporting piers, on one side ; and 
it was hanging by the strands of the wire ropes of one side alone. It didn t seem possible 
to cross it, if we waited for night, if, indeed, we could pass it anyhow; and in very 
desperation we determined to attempt the matter at once. Our footing was the railing 
on the side of the bridge. Steadying ourselves as well as we could, by grasping the 
connecting stay rods, we did cross. ( E could not have done it with my one serviceable 
arm, had not Doherty helped me.) Almost immediately we came full upon a party 
of men, by the side of the road, whose nods and whisperings alarmed us much. There 
was nothing for us but to march by as unconcernedly as possible, and, once out of 
their sight, to take to the woods and hide again. It was near morning when we 
started again; and having succeeded in Hanking Springfield, turned away for our last 
rest before reaching our lines. We were now nearing a new danger. The old 
soldiers, who had been detailed to guard the bridges and stations along the Baltimore 
and Ohio Railroad, had been drawn off by Sigel and Hunter, for their expedition up 
the Valley; and their places had been filled by the 100 days men, as they were 
called, who were neither well drilled or disciplined. There was danger on approach 
ing the outposts, at any of these stations, after dark, lest the sentinel, in the nervous 
ness springing from his inexperience, should fire before he challenged. So, in view of 
this danger, we started early in the afternoon, kept the cover of the woods for a while, 
and when within two or three miles of our journey s end, came out upon the pike, 
which we boldly followed. No sign of life disturbed us as we limped along. We 
reached the smouldering fires and smoking ruins which marked where a rail 
road station had been, unchallenged. One house only of the little village was 
standing ; at the door of which stood two females exulting over the destruction. An 
application for admittance to the house, and for food, was denied ; and we turned 
away, to cross the Potomac into "Oldtown," Maryland. The foot bridge had been 
also destroyed; and Doherty led the way to the "ford" below. We entered the 
water, which sent a chill through our bodies. The stream was swift, and it was with 
great difficulty that we made way against the force of the current. Tbe crossing 
made, we sat down on the bank, to wring the water from our clothes. That done, we 
set out for the village. "Halt there! " sang out a long-legged fellow, dressed in the 
uniform of our cavalry, and who came out of a house near by, and made his way to 
us. But we did not care to stop; and he soon overtook us. "Where are you going?" 
he asked. " Up to a tavern, if there is any here," was answered, and he led the 
way. It was quite dark; so that, unnoticed by us, quite a crowd followed on after. 

Just as we reached the door of the hotel, the old landlady was about shutting up 
for the night. Our civil request to be furnished with supper brought the ungracious 
response " that we could not have any." " Why not, my dear Madame?" "It s 
too late to be cooking supper for anybody, to-night." " You can give us some bread 

and milk, can t you? we are very hungry." "No." "Why not?" "Thatd d 

McNeil has driven away all my cows." " Well, you can give us some bread and 
butter, surely! " "Yes; I suppose I can do that," and off she went on the errand. 
The crowd which had followed us, now pressed round, clamorous to know our names, 
and business, and destination, and where we came from; to but few of which questions 



LIEUT. COL. LINCOLN. 17 

were any direct replies made. Matters were fast getting unpleasant for us, when the 
old lady announced that our supper was ready. We ate it without ceremony; and 
almost stifled by the closeness of the room (every window being shut down) and un 
suspicious of any pending trouble, stepped to the door for a breath of fresh air. A 
crowd of some eighty to one hundred people stood crowding around the door, and 
shouts of " make them answer " greeted us as we made our appearance. A little ban 
tam of a fellow, with a musket almost as large as he was, touching me on the shoulder 
demanded to be informed who we were, etc. * Friends," I answered. " But that 
won t do," he said. " Where did you come from?" " Romney." " Where are you 
going?" " Martinsburg," (most unfortunate answer for Early held the place, a fact 
which at the time was unknown to us. ) " What do you want there." "That s none of 
your business," and thereupon the crowd shouted "They are spies, take them to the 
guardhouse." It was getting serious; and I offered if there was a decent man among 
them, who would come into the house and listen, that I would tell our story, and 
satisfy him that there was nothing to fear from us; but that I would not talk to the 
crowd around. So a spruce, gentlemanly-looking man was pushed to the front, who led 
the Avay into a side room, wherein lay a wounded rebel officer, victim of the little affair 
of the Tuesday before, the* cannonading from which had awakened us in our retreat. To 
this man, I told, without reservation, the whole history of our escape, and everything 
connected with it; and I confess was indignant when I concluded, to hear him say 
" that he reckoned it wa3 all right, but he " was peculiarly situated, and he didn t think 
he could satisfy the people outside." Of course, nothing more could be done on our 
part, and so we followed him to the door. He did nothing to try and relieve us; and 
again my little friend with the musket, ordered us to go with him to the guard house. 
We still refused; and some one in the crowd sang out " Where s Thresher? send for 
Thresher!" A short, thick-set man soon made his appearance, to whom I gave our 
history as before, and from whom I received a hearty grasp of the hand, and an assu 
rance that he would set all right. He did so in a few words, and the crowd at once 
dispersed. It was now past one o clock, and I turned to the landlady with a request 
for a bed. "You can t sleep in this house to-night," she said. " Why, what s the 
matter, now?" I asked. " Why, McNeil may come back to-night; and if he should, 
and you were in the house, you could not get away so easily," was her answer. 
" Well, come Doherty, its only one night more; let us be ofEJ " But as I turned, this 
Mr. Thresher announced his intention of going into the woods with us. Waiting for 
him to go after a covering, we followed as he led the way into the mountains, where 
already some twenty of the citizens of the place, afraid to remain at their homes, were 
soundly sleeping. A dense fog had settled down upon the earth. We lay and shivered, 
but could not sleep; and at the early dawn, made orr way to the tavern which had 
been so inhospitably closed against us the night before. Here, at breakfast, we met 

Capt. Squires, of the Virginia Cavalry, down from Cumberland, in command of 

a small scouting party. We learned from him the situation of affairs in the Valley, 
and by his advice concluded to make our way to Cumberland. It was nineteen miles 
there, and neither of us were in condition to walk any farther. But horses were not 
to be obtained for love or money. All that McNeil had not robbed these people of, 
had been driven into the mountains for safety. We must walk or stay where we were. 
So taking directions from Capt. Squires, we got on to the tow path of the canal, and 
started. It wanted a few minutes to seven o clock when we set forth. Nobody can 
imagine how we suffered, as we struggled on in this, our first exposure for months to 
the rays of the sun. At half -past two we were at the mouth of Patterson s Creek 9 
only seven miles from our starting place, and looking across the river, caught sight of 
a repair party at work upon a partially burned railroad bridge; and what seemed 
better, something which we took to be a locomotive engine. So, spite of the shouts 
and gestures of the working party, who watched us narrowly, we plunged into the

river, and after many tumbles and much trouble, succeeded in crossing. Our friends 
had been endeavoring to make us understand, by their gestures, etc., that the river 
was not ford able; but we could not hear what was said, till it seemed easier to keep on 
than to return. As we came up from the river, faint and exhausted, our appearance 
attracted tbo attention of three gentlemen who were enjoying the shade of some large 
trees at the station house. I had called a young boy to me, and sent him off to get us 
some milk. At his departure one of these gentlemen came up to where we were silting, 
with the remark "You are pretty well played out, I see; how far have you been travel 
ing?" " From Oldtown." " That would not have worn you so !" " The sun is dreadful 
ly hot, and we are n t used to it." Eyeing us still more sharply " You are soldiers! " 
he said. " Well, that s a good one," said I. " Oh, you need not deny it; I can see 
that plainly enough ! But you need not be afraid of me, if you are in Virginia. My 
name is Everett. I m a cousin of Edward Everett, who was Governor of Massachu 
setts; you ve heard of him, I reckon, and I am a thorough-going Union man. You 
want to go to Cumberland? Well, come up to my house, eat dinner with me, and 
to-night, when the engine comes down to take back these men here, I ll get a place 
for you on the train." I met this frank speech with equal plainness, and told him our 
story. As we were on the way to his house, we met the boy (his son) with a pitcher of 
milk. "Don t drink that now," said he, "wait and, have some whiskey first, and 
then, with your dinner, you may have all the milk you want. That s my advice as a 
medical man." And so we went to his house, drank his whiskey, ate his dinner, took 
his milk, and engaged in conversation till the noise of the engine warned us it was 
time to separate. Accompanying us to the train, he helped us on board, shook hands 
as he bid us good-bye, with a wish for our success, and we steamed away. 

Reaching Cumberland, I reported at Department Headquarters. "How are you, 
Colonel? how did you get here? and where, in heaven s name, have you been?" 
exclaimed Gen. Kelley, as, jumping from his seat, he grasped my hand. "I heard of 
you, long ago, as having escaped ; and not seeing you, or hearing anything of you, 
concluded you had been retaken, or had died on your way." " Heard of me, General! 
How could that have been?" "Some one of our men, who got away when you did, 
came in more than ten days ago, and reported!" The mystery was soon solved, by 
the appearance of our hospital cook. He had been allowed by the guard to pass and 
repass at all hours; was out of the hospital when w4 left; at his return, looked first for 
Doherty, and then for Snow, neither of whom could he find; recalled the fact that 
they had been consulting closely the day before; came to the conclusion that they had 
escaped; turned on his heels, was allowed to pass out, went to a neighboring house, 
where lived a young girl he had been making love to; roused her, and exchanged his 
clothes for an old suit of her father s, which she threw out of the window; started off; 
walked all night; and, after a good nap, started the next day, in broad daylight; was 

halted by one of a party of loyal men called , organized to resist conscription 

in their region; was conducted to the officer in command, to whom he told his story; 
was taken to a neighboring house, where he was given his meals, and kept secreted 
till night; then mounted on horseback and guided safely on his way till morning; 
when he was again ushered into a farmhouse, where he was fed and kept through the 
day, as before; when, mounted upon another horse, he was again guided on his way. 
And so, concealed and well-cared for by day, and riding from station to station by 
night, he made, in a week s time, a pleasant journey; while we, unaided, had had 
seventeen days of toil, exposure, suffering and danger. 

Seeing my enfeebled condition, Gen. Kelley sent for Dr. Lewis, surgeon at the 
General Hospital at Claryville, to whom he gave me in charge. Here I was given the 
luxury of a warm bath : was furnished with a change of underclothing, after my 
wounds, which were in a sad state, were dressed ; and, refreshed by a delicious supper 
and the cool breezes of the mountain, I rested in the quiet enjoyment of my accom 
plished escape.
