TO JAMES MADISON, ESQ. 
</p><p>
WILLJAMSBURG, March 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1778">1778</a>. 
</p><p>
HONOEED SIR, 
</p><p>
We have no news here that can be depended on. It is said 
by Mr. King, who is just from Petersburg, that a gentleman was 
at that place who informed that sundry persons had arrived at 
Edenton from Providence Island, who affirmed that they saw in 
Providence a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> paper giving an account that Bourgoyne's 
disaster had produced the most violent fermentation in England; 
that the Parliament had refused to grant the supplies for carrying on the war, and that a motion for acknowledging our independence was overruled by a small majority only. 
</p><p>
The people who bring this news to Edenton, as the story 
goes, were prisoners with the enemy at Providence, when they 
were relieved by a New England privateer, which suddenly 
landed her men, took possession of the small fort that commanded the harbor, and secured several vessels that lay in it, 
one of which was given up to these men to bring them to the 
continent. I leave you to form your own judgment as to the 
credibility of this report. I wish it carried stronger marks of 
truth. 
</p><p>
The Governor has just received a letter from the captain of 
the French frigate I mentioned in my last, informing him of his 
safe arrival in North Carolina with a rich cargo of various 
useful and important articles, which will be offered for sale to 
us. The frigate belongs to a company at Nantes, in France. 
We also hear, but in a less authentic manner, that 7,000 tents 
have arrived at Martinique, on their way from France to the 
grand army. 
A letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> town, this moment received, informs 
us that an exchange of prisoners is at last agreed on between 
</p><p>
W. and H. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate son.
