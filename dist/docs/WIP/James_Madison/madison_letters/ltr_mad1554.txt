</p><p>
DEAR SIR, The recommendation from the meeting at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>, of a plenipotentiary Convention in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> in May 
next, has been well received by the Assembly here. Indeed, 
the evidence of dangerous defects in the confederation has at 
length proselyted the most obstinate adversaries to a reform. 
The unanimous sanction given by the Assembly to the inclosed 
compliance with the Recommendation marks sufficiently the 
revolution of sentiment which the experience of one year has 
effected in this country. The deputies are not yet appointed. 
It is expected that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a>, the present Governor, 
E. Randolph, and the late one, Mr. Henry, will be of the number. 
</p><p>
The project for bartering the Mississippi to Spain was brought 
before the Assembly after the preceding measure had been 
adopted. The report of it having reached the ears of the Western Representatives, as many of them as were on the spot, 
backed by a number of the late officers, presented a memorial, 
full of consternation and complaint; in consequence of which, 
some very pointed Resolutions, by way of instruction to the 
Delegates in Congress, were unanimously entered into by the 
House of Delegates. They are now before the Senate, who will 
no doubt be also unanimous in their concurrence. 
</p><p>
The question of paper money was among the first with which 
the session opened. It was introduced by petitions from two 
Counties. The discussion was faintly supported by a few obscure patrons of the measure, and, on the vote, it was thrown 
out by 85 against 17. A petition for paying off the public securities according to a scale of their current prices was unanimously rejected. 
</p><p>
The consideration of the Revised Code has been resumed, and 
prosecuted pretty far towards its conclusion. I find, however, 
that it will be impossible, as well as unsafe, to give an ultimate 
fiat to the system at this session. The expedient I have in view 
is to provide for a supplemental revision by a Committee, who 
shall accommodate the bills skipped over, and the subsequent 
laws, to such part of the Code as has been adopted, suspending 
the operation of the latter for one year longer. Such a work 
is rendered indispensable by the alterations made in some of 
the bills in their passage, by the change of circumstances, which 
call for corresponding changes in sundry bills which have been 
laid by, and by the incoherence between the whole Code and 
the laws in force of posterior date to the Code. This business 
has consumed a great deal of the time of two sessions, and has 
given infinite trouble to some of us. We have never been without opponents, who contest, at least, every innovation inch by 
inch. The bill proportioning crimes and punishments, on which 
we were wrecked last year, has, after undergoing a number of 
alterations, got through a Committee of the whole; but it has 
not yet been reported to the House, where it will meet with 
the most vigorous attack. I think the chance is rather against 
its final passage in that branch of the Assembly; and if it should 
not miscarry there, it will have another gauntlet to run through 
the Senate. 
</p><p>
The bill on the subject of Education, which could not safely 
be brought into discussion at all last year, has undergone a 
pretty indulgent consideration this. In order to obviate the 
objection from the inability of the Country to bear the expence, 
it was proposed that it should be passed into a law, but its operation suspended for three or four years. Even in this form, 
however, there would be hazard in pushing it to a final question, and I begin to think it will be best to let it lie over for 
the supplemental Reviserv. who may, perhaps, be able to put it 
into some shape that will lessen the objection of expence. I 
should have no hesitation at this policy if I saw a chance of 
getting a Committee equal to the work of compleating the revision. Mr. Pendleton is too far gone to take any part in it. 
Mr. Wythe, I suppose, will not decline any duty which may be 
imposed on him, but it seems almost cruel to tax his patriotic 
zeal any farther. Mr. Blair is the only remaining character in 
which full confidence could be placed. 
</p><p>
The delay in the administration of Justice from the accumulation of business in the General Court, and despair of obtaining a reform according to the Assize plan, have led me to give 
up this plan in favor of district Courts, which differ from the 
former in being clothed with all the powers of the General 
Court within their respective districts. The bill on the latter 
plan will be reported in a few days, and will probably, though 
not certainly, be adopted. 
</p><p>
The fruits of the impolitic measures taken at the last session 
with regard to taxes are bitterly tasted now. Our Treasury is 
empty, no supplies have gone to the federal treasury, and our 
internal embarrassments torment us exceedingly. The present 
Assembly have good dispositions on the subject, but some time 
will elapse before any of their arrangements can be productive. 
In one instance only, the general principles of finance have been 
departed from. The specie part of the tax under collection is 
made payable in Tobacco. This indulgence to the people, as it 
is called and considered, was so warmly wished for out of doors, 
and so strenuously pressed within, that it could not be rejected 
without danger of exciting some worse project of a popular 
cast. As Tobacco alone is made commutable, there is reason 
to hope the public treasury will suffer little, if at all. It may 
possibly gain. 
</p><p>
The repeal of the port bill has not yet been attempted. Col. 
Mason has been waited for as the hero of the attack. As it is 
become uncertain whether he will be down at all, the question 
will probably be brought forward in a few days. The repeal, 
were he present, would be morally certain. Under the disadvantage of his absence, it is more than probable. The question 
of British debts has also awaited his patronage. I am unable 
to say what the present temper is on that subject, nothing having passed that could make trial of it. The repeated disappointments I have sustained in efforts in favor of the Treaty 
make me extremely averse to take the lead in the business 
again. 
</p><p>
The public appointments have been disposed of as follows: 
The contest for the chair lay between Col. Bland and Mr. Prentis. The latter prevailed by a majority of near 20 votes. Mr. 
Harrison, the late Speaker, lost his election in Surrey, which he 
represented last year; and since has been equally unsuccessful 
in his pristine County, Charles City, where he made a second 
experiment. In the choice of a Governor, Mr. E. Randolph 
had a considerable majority of the whole in the first ballot. 
His competitors were Col. Bland and R. H. Lee, each of whom 
had between 20 and 30 votes. The delegation to Congress contained, under the first choice, Grayson, Carrington, R. H. Lee, 
Mr. Jones, and myself. Col. H. Lee, of the last delegation, was 
dropped. The causes were different, I believe, and not very 
accurately known to me. One of them is said to have been his 
supposed heterodoxy touching the Mississippi. Mr. Jones has 
since declined his appointment, and Col. Lee has been reinstated 
by an almost unanimous vote. A vacancy in the Council, produced by the resignation of Mr. Roane, is filled by Mr. Boiling 
Starke. Cyrus Grififin was a candidate, but was left considerably in the rear. The Attorney Generalship has been conferred 
on Col. Innes. Mr. Marshall had a handsome vote. 
</p><p>
Our summer and fall have been wet beyond all imagination 
in some places, and much so everywhere. The crops of corn 
are in general plentiful. The price up the country will not 
exceed 8 or 10s. In this district it is scarcest and dearest, 
being already as high as 12 or 15s. The crop of Tobacco will 
fall short considerably, it is calculated, of the last year's. The 
highest and lowest prices in the Country, of the new crop, are 
25 and 20s. A rise is confidently expected. 
</p><p>
My next will be from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, whither I shall set out as 
soon as the principal business of the Session is over. Till my 
arrival there I postpone communications relative to our national 
affairs, which I shall then be able to make on better grounds, 
as well as some circumstances relative to the affairs of this 
State, which the hurry of the present opportunity restrains me 
from entering into. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
