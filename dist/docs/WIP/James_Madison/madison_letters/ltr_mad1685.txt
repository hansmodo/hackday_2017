TO JAMES MONBOE.

DEAR SIR, You will find by one of the Gazettes herewith 
sent, that the bill fixing the permanent seat of Government on 
the Potowmac, and the temporary at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, has got 
through the Senate. It passed by a single voice only, Izzard 
and Few having both voted against it. Its passage through the 
House of Representatives is probable, but attended with great 
difficulties. If the Potowmac succeeds, even on these terms, it 
will have resulted from a fortuitous coincidence of circumstances 
which might never happen again. 
</p><p>
The provision for the public debt has been suspended for 
some time in the Senate by the question relating to the seat of 
Government. It is now resumed in that House, and it is to be 
hoped will soon be brought to an issue. The assumption sleeps, 
but I am persuaded will be awakened on the first dawn of a favorable opportunity. It seems, indeed, as if the friends of the 
measure were determined to risk everything rather than suffer 
that finally to fail. 
</p><p>
We hear nothing further of the controversy between England 
and Spain.
