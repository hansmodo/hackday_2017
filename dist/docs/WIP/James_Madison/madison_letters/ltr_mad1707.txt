DEAR SIR, You will find by the inclosed papers that the 
President's negative has saved us from the unconstitutional allotment of 120 Representatives proposed by the Bill on that 
subject. The contest is now to be between a ratio of 1 for 30, 
and one for 33 thousand. If the next bill should begin with 
the former, I think it most likely to end in the latter, this being 
most favorable to the northern part of the Union the circumstance which produced the curious project contained in the 
other Bill. The assumption of the remainder of the State debts, 
amounting to about 41,000,000 dollars, has been lately on the 
anvil. The first vote was in its favor. On the 2 d , it was thrown 
out. It will, however, be pretty certainly renewed, and, in the 
end, not improbably carried. Besides a legion of objections 
against the measure, its being pressed is the more extraordinary, as the progress of the Commissioners for settling the final 
balances among the States promises a conclusion of the work 
almost as soon as provision can be made for paying the first 
interest on the debts to be assumed. For the plan is, to pass 
the assumption now, and leave the revenue to be provided hereafter. The obligation of public faith will then be an answer to 
all objections against the new taxes, or contrivances that will 
be called for. The ways and means for the Western defence 
have been the subject of latest discussion. They consist of increased duties on imports; and it is to be feared that advantage 
will be taken of the occasion to make the increase permanent, 
although the object is temporary. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> continues to be 
a scene of Bankruptcies, resulting from 's fate, and the 
fall of the Stocks. Every day exhibits new victims, and opens 
new scenes of usury, knavery, and folly. If the Stocks should 
not be artificially revived, it is suspected that the ensuing week 
will be a very trying one to this City.
