<p>
TO JAMES MADISON, SEN K . 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Sepf 30th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>. 
</p><p>
HON'D SlR, By Mr. Blair, who left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> immediately 
after the rising of the Convention, I sent to the care of Mr. F. 
Maury a copy of the new Constitution proposed for the U. S. 
Mr. Blair set out in such haste that I had no time to write by 
him, and I thought the omission of the less consequence, as your 
last letter led me to suppose that you must, about that time, be 
absent on your trip to Frederick. 
</p><p>
I arrived here on monday last. The act of the Convention 
was then before Congress. It has been since taken up, and by 
a unanimous vote forwarded to the States, to be proceeded on 
as recommended by the Convention. What reception this new 
system will generally meet with cannot yet be pronounced. 
For obvious reasons, opposition is as likely to arise in Virginia 
as anywhere. The city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> has warmly espoused 
it. Both parties there, it is said, have united on the occasion. 
It may happen, nevertheless, that a country party may spring 
up and give a preponderancy to the opposite scale. In this city 
the general voice coincides with that of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, but there 
is less apparent unanimity, and it is pretty certain that the 
party in power will be active in defeating the new system. In 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> the reception given to it is extremely favorable, we are 
told, but more will depend on the country than the town. The 
echo from Connecticut and New Jersey, as far as it has reached 
us, denotes a favorable disposition in those States. 
</p><p>
I inclose a few plumb-stones from an excellent tree. I am 
aware that this is not the true mode of propagating the fruit, 
but it sometimes succeeds, and sometimes even improves the 
fruit. 
</p><p>
With my affectionate regards to my mother and the family, 
I remain, your dutiful son.
