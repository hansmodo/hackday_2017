DEAR SIR, I have been duly favoured with yours of the 3rd 
instant. The length of the interval since my last has proceeded 
from a daily expectation of being able to communicate the final 
arrangements for introducing the new government. The place 
of meeting has undergone much discussion, as you conjectured, 
and still remains to be fixed. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> was first named, 
and negatived by a voice from Delaware. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> came 
forward next, Lancaster was opposed to it, and failed. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> was next tried, and, to the surprise of every one, had seven 
votes. It was easy to see that that ground, had it been free 
from objections, was not maintainable. Accordingly, the next 
day <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> was inserv.d in the place of it, with the aid of 
the vote of Rhode Island. Rhode Island, however, has refused 
to give a final vote in the business, and has actually retired 
from Congress. The question will be resumed between New 
York and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. - It was much to be wished that a fit 
place for a respectable outset to the government could be found 
more central than either. The former is inadmissible, if any 
regard be to be had to the Southern or Western country. It is 
so with me for another reason; that it tends to stop the final 
and permanent seat short of the Potowmac certainly, and probably in the State of New Jersey. I know this to be one of the 
views of the advocates for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. The only chance the 
Potowmac has, is to get things in such a train that a coalition 
may take place between the southern and Eastern States on the 
subject, and still more, that the final seat may be undecided for 
two or three years, within which period the Western and south 
Western population will enter more into the estimate. Whereever Congress may be, the choice, if speedily made, will not be 
sufficiently influenced by that consideration. In this point of 
view, I am of opinion <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> would have been unfriendly to 
the true object. It would have retained Congress but a moment, so many States being north of it, and dissatisfied with it; 
and would have produced a coalition among those States, and a 
precipitate election of the permanent seat, and an intermediate 
removal to a more northern position.

You will have seen the circular letter from the Convention 
of this State. It has a most pestilent tendency. If an early 
general Convention cannot be parried, it is serv.usly to be 
feared that the system which has resisted so many direct attacks may be at last successfully undermined by its enemies. It 
is now, perhaps, to be wished that Rhode Island may not accede till this new crisis of danger be over. Some think it 
would have been better if even <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> had held out till the 
operation of the government could have dissipated the fears 
which artifice had created, and the attempts resulting from 
those fears and artifices. 
</p><p>
We hear nothing yet from North Carolina more than comes 
by the way of Petersburg. 
</p><p>
With the highest respect and attachment, I remain, D'r Sir, 
your affect 6 serv.
