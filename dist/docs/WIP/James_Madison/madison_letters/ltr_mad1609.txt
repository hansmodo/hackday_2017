TO COL. JAMES MADISON.

HON B SIR, No question has yet been taken by which the 
strength of parties can be determined. The calculations on 
different sides do not accord, each making them under the bias 
of their particular wishes. I think, however, the friends of the 
Constitution are most confident of superiority, and am inclined 
myself to think they have, at this time, the advantage of 3 or 4, 
or possibly more, in point of number. The final question will 
probably decide the contest in a few days more. We are now 
on the Judiciary Department, against which the last efforts of 
the adversaries seem to be made. How far they will be able to 
make an impression, I cannot say. It is not probable that many 
proselytes will be made on either side. As this will be handed 
to you at Court, you can make its contents known to Major 
Moore and other friends, to whom I have not time separately 
to write. 
</p><p>
With my regards to my mother and the family, I remain, your 
affectionate son. 
</p>
