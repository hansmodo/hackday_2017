BEAR SIR, I am particularly obliged by your favor of the 
3d, which incloses your remarks on the Judiciary bill. It came 
to hand yesterday only, and I have not had time to compare 
your suggestions with the plan of the Senate; nor do I know 
the alterations which may have taken place in it since it has 
been under discussion. In many points, even supposing the 
outline a good one, which I have always viewed as controvertible, defects and inaccuracies were striking. 
</p><p>
It gives me much pleasure to find your approbation given to 
the decision of the House of Representatives on the power of 
removal. This appears to be the case with several of our 
friends in Virginia, of whose sentiments I had formed other 
conjectures. I was apprehensive that the alarms with regard 
to the danger of Monarchy would have diverted their attention 
from the impropriety of transferring an Executive trust from 
the most to the least responsible member of the Government. 
Independently of every other consideration, the primary objects 
on which the Senate are to be employed seem to require that 
their executive agency should not be extended beyond the minimum that will suffice. As the Judiciary tribunal which is to 
decide on impeachments, they ought not to be called on previously for a summary opinion on cases which may come before 
them in another capacity; and both on that account, and the 
necessity of keeping them in a fit temper to controul the capricious and factious counsels of the other Legislative branch, they 
ought to be as little as possible involved in those questions of 
a personal nature, which, in all Governments, are the most frequent and violent causes of animosity and party. 
</p><p>
You will find in one of the inclosed papers the act imposing 
duties, as it finally passed. The collection bill has passed the 
House of Representatives, and awaits the last hand of the Senate. It is very long, and has cost much trouble in adjusting 
the regulations to the various geographical and other circumstances of the States. It is in many respects inaccurate and 
deficient, but may do to begin with. We have endeavored to 
make the part relating to Virginia a little more palatable than 
the late State laws. On Rappahannock, vessels are to report 
at Urbanna, enter at Hobbshole, and deliver at any of the ports, 
including <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> and Port Royal, and foreign as well 
as American vessels. The like on the other rivers. 
</p><p>
To secure the opportunity by this mail, I must hasten my assurances that I am, dear sir, yours affectionately.
