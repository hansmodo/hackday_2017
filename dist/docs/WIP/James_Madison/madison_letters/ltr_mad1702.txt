MY DEAR Sm, Mr. Marshall called last evening with your 
favor of the 17th, but not being at home I have not yet seen 
him. The subject of Western defence is not yet over. In 
relation to it I have nothing to add to the communications in 
my last. You will see in Freneau's paper of to-morrow morning the justifying memorial of the Executive against the charge 
of neglecting the requisite pacific measures. 
</p><p>
Your ideas of reformation in the Western system appear to 
me to be just in every point on which I can presume to judge. 
I wish they may occur to those who can give them due effect. 
</p>
