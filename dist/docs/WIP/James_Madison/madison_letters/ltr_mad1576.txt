HON D SlK, ******** 
</p><p>
I am sorry that I cannot gratify your wish to be informed of 
the proceedings of the Convention. An order of secrecy leaves 
me at liberty merely to tell you that nothing definitive is yet 
done, that the Session will probably continue for some time yet, 
that an adjournment took place on thursday last until Monday 
week, and that a Committee is to be at work in the mean time. 
Late information from Europe presents a sad picture of things 
in Holland. Civil blood has been already spilt, and various 
circumstances threaten a torrent of it. Many, it is said, are 
flying with their property to England. How much is it to be 
lamented that America does not present a more inviting asylum! 
</p><p>
Congress have been occupied for some time past on Western 
affairs. They have provided for the Government of the Country by an ordinance, of which a copy is herewith inclosed. 
They have on the anvil, at present, some projects for the most 
advantageous sale of the lands. Col. Carrington informs me that 
Indian affairs wear a very hostile appearance; that money must 
in all probability be expended in further treaties; that a General Confederacy has been formed of all the nations and tribes 
from the six nations, inclusive, to the Mississippi, under the auspices of Brandt; that a General Council was held in December 
last in form, near Detroit, in which was considered as grievances the surveying of lands on the North West side of the 
Ohio, the pretext being, as usual, that the treaties which preceded that measure were made by parts only of the Nations 
whose consent was necessary, and that a united representation 
of this grievance has been received by Congress. That as to 
the hostilities on Kentucky, the superintendent of Indian affairs, 
or, in case of his inability to go, Col. Harmar, is ordered to 
proceed immediately to some convenient place for holding a 
Treaty with the hostile tribes, and by that means restore, if 
possible, peace in that quarter. In the mean time, Col. Harmer 
is so to fort the federal troops as to provide the best defence 
for the country, and to call for such aids of Militia as he shall 
find necessary.

The crops of wheat in this and the neighbouring States, and, 
indeed, throughout the Continent, as far as I can learn, have 
been remarkably fine. I am sorry to hear that your crops of 
corn are likely to be so much shortened by the dry weather. 
The weather has been dry in spots in this quarter. At present 
it is extremely seasonable just here, and I do not know that it 
is otherwise elsewhere. I hope Virginia partakes of the blessing. 
</p><p>
A letter from my brother gave me the first notice of your indisposition. It is my most fervent wish that this may find your 
health thoroughly re-established, and that of my mother and the 
rest of the family unimpaired. Being, with entire affection, your 
dutiful son.
