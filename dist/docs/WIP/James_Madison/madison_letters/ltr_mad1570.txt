DEAR SIR, The vigorous measures finally pursued by the 
Government of Massachusetts against the insurgents had the 
intended effect of dispersing them. By some it was feared that 
they would re-embody on the return of favorable weather. As 
yet, no symptom of such a design has appeared. It would seem 
that they mean to try their strength in another way ; that is, 
by endeavoring to give the elections such a turn as may promote their views under the auspices of Constitutional forms. 
How far they may succeed is not yet reducible to. certainty. 
That a great change will be effected in the component members 
of the Government is certain, but the degree of influence imputable to the malcontents cannot be well known till some 
specimen shall be given of the temper of the new rulers. A 
great proportion of the Senate is changed, and a greater proportion of the other branch it is expected will be changed. A 
paper emission, at least, is apprehended from this revolution in 
their councils. 
</p><p>
Considerable changes are taking place, I hear, in the County 
elections in Virginia, and a strong itch beginning to return for 
paper money. Mr. Henry is said to have the measure in contemplation, and to be laying his train for it already. He will, 
however, be powerfully opposed by Col. Mason, if he should be 
elected and be able to serv.; by Monroe, Marshall, and Ludwell Lee, (son of R. H. Lee,) who are already elected ; and 
sundry others of inferior rank. Mr. Harrison, the late Governor, has so far regained the favor of Charles City as to be reinstated a representative. The part which he will take is uncertain. From his repeated declarations he ought to be adverse 
to a paper emission.

l. Faiiureof thestates l - s evil has been so ful1 ^ experienced 
to comply with the Con- both during the war and since the peace, 
stitutional requisitions. ^^ g() naturally frQm the number and 
</p><p>
independent authority of the States, and has been so uniformly 
exemplified in every similar Confederacy, that it may be considered as not less radically and permanently inherent in, than 
it is fatal to the object of, the present system. 
</p><p>
2. Encroachments by 2 ' Examples of this are numerous, and 
the States on the federal repetitions may be foreseen in almost every 
</p><p>
case where any favorite object of a State 
shall present a temptation. Among these examples are the 
wars and treaties of Georgia with the Indians, the unlicensed 
compacts between Virginia and Maryland, and between Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the troops raised and to be kept up 
by Massachusetts. 
</p><p>
3. Violations of the 3 ' From the number of Legislatures, the 
law of nations and of sphere of life from which most of their 
</p><p>
members are taken, and the circumstances 
under which their legislative business is carried on, irregularities of this kind must frequently happen. Accordingly, not a 
year has passed without instances of them in some one or other 
of the States. The Treaty of Peace, the treaty with France, 
the treaty with Holland, have each been violated. [See the 
complaints to Congress on these subjects.] The causes of these 
irregularities must necessarily produce frequent violations of 
the law of nations in other respects. 
</p><p>
As yet, foreign powers have not been rigorous in animadverting on us. This moderation, however, cannot be mistaken 
for a permanent partiality to our faults, or a permanent security 
against those disputes with other nations, which, being among 
the greatest of public calamities, it ought to be least in the 
power of any part of the community to bring on the whole. 
</p><p>
4. Trespass of the 4 * These are alarming symptoms, and 
States on the rights of may be daily apprehended, as we are admonished by daily experience. See the 
</p><p>
law of Virginia restricting foreign vessels to certain ports; of 
Maryland in favor of vessels belonging to her own citizens; of 
N. York in favor of the same. 
</p><p>
Paper money, instalments of debts, occlusion of courts, making 
property a legal tender, may likewise be deemed aggressions 
on the rights of other States. As the citizens of every State, 
aggregately taken, stand more or less in the relation of creditors or debtors to the citizens of every other State, acts of the 
debtor State in favor of debtors affect the creditor State in the 
same manner as they do its own citizens, who are, relatively, 
creditors towards other citizens. This remark may be extended 
to foreign nations. If the exclusive regulation of the value 
and alloy of coin was properly delegated to the federal authority, the policy of it equally requires a controul on the States 
in the cases above mentioned. It must have been meant 1. 
To preserv.uniformity in the circulating medium throughout the 
nation. 2. To prevent those frauds on the citizens of other 
States, and the subjects of foreign powers, which might disturb 
the tranquillity at home, or involve the union in foreign contests. 
</p><p>
The practice of many States in restricting the commercial 
intercourse with other States, and putting their productions 
and manufactures on the same footing with those of foreign 
nations, though not contrary to the federal articles, is certainly 
adverse to the spirit of the Union, and tends to beget retaliating regulations, not less expensive and vexatious in themselves 
than they are destructive of the general harmony. 
</p><p>
5. Want of concert in 5 s defect is strongly illustrated in 
matters where common the state of our commercial affairs. How 
</p><p>
much has the national dignity, interest, 
and revenue, suffered from this cause ? Instances of inferior 
moment are the want of uniformity in the laws concerning 
naturalization and literary property ; of provision for national 
seminaries; for grants of incorporation for national purposes, 
</p><p>
for canals, and other works of general utility; which may at 
present be defeated by the perverseness of particular States 
whose concurrence is necessary. 
</p><p>
6. Want of Guaranty 6 - The Confederation is silent on this 
to the States of their point, and therefore by the second article 
Constitutions and laws ,-, , j f ,-, j -, ,1 , , j 
against internal vio- the hands ot the federal authority are tied. 
</p><p>
lence - According to Republican Theory, Right 
</p><p>
and power, being both vested in the majority, are held to be 
synonymous. According to fact and experience, a minority 
may, in an appeal to force, be an overmatch for the majority: 
1. If the minority happen to include all such as possess the 
skill and habits of military life, and such as possess the great 
pecuniary resources, one-third only may conquer the remaining 
two-thirds. 2. One-third of those who participate in the choice 
of the rulers may be rendered a majority by the accession of 
those whose poverty excludes them from a right of suffrage, 
and who, for obvious reasons, will be more likely to join the 
standard of sedition than that of the established Government. 
3. Where slavery exists, the republican Theory becomes still 
more fallacious. 
</p><p>
7. A sanction is essential to the idea of

</p><p>
in the Government of ^he federal system being destitute of both, 
the Confederacy. J 
</p><p>
wants the great vital principles of a Political Constitution. Under the form of such a Constitution, it is 
in fact nothing more than a treaty of amity, of commerce, and 
of alliance, between independent and Sovereign States. From 
what cause could so fatal an omission have happened in the 
articles of Confederation? From a mistaken confidence that 
the justice, the good faith, the honor, the sound policy of the 
several legislative assemblies would render superfluous any appeal to the ordinary motives by which the laws secure the obedience of individuals; a confidence which does honor to the 
enthusiastic virtue of the compilers, as much as the inexperience 
of the crisis apologizes for their errors. The time which has 
since elapsed has had the double effect of increasing the light 
and tempering the warmth with which the arduous work may 
"be revised. It is no longer doubted that a unanimous and punctual obedience of 13 independent bodies to the acts of the federal Government ought not to be calculated on. Even during the 
war, when external danger supplied in some degree the defect 
of legal and coercive sanctions, how imperfectly did the States 
fulfil their obligations to the Union? In time of peace we see 
already what is to be expected. How, indeed, could it be otherwise? In the first place, every general act of the Union must 
necessarily bear unequally hard on some particular member or 
members of it; secondly, the partiality of the members to their 
own interests and rights, a partiality which will be fostered by 
the courtiers of popularity, will naturally exaggerate the inequality where it exists, and even suspect it where it has no existence; thirdly, a distrust of the voluntary compliance of each 
other may prevent the compliance of any, although it should be 
the latent disposition of all. Here are causes and pretexts 
which will never fail to render federal measures abortive. If 
the laws of the States were merely recommendatory to their 
citizens, or if they were to be rejudged by county authorities, 
what security, what probability would exist that they would be 
carried into execution? Is the security or probability greater 
in favor of the acts of Congress, which, depending for their execution on the will of the State legislatures, are, tho' nominally authoritative, in fact recommendatory only?

the Constitution. In others, however, it 
has received no other sanction than that of the legislative authority. From this defect two evils result: 1. Whenever a law 
of a State happens to be repugnant to an act of Congress, particularly when the latter is of posterior date to the former, it 
will be at least questionable whether the latter must not prevail; and as the question must be decided by the Tribunals of 
the State, they will be most likely to lean on the side of the 
State. 
</p><p>
2. As far as the union of the States is to be regarded as a 
league of sovereign powers, and not as a political Constitution, 
by virtue of which they are become one sovereign power, so far 
it seems to follow, from the doctrine of compacts, that a breach 
of any of the articles of the Confederation by any of the parties 
to it absolves the other parties from their respective obligations, and gives them a right, if they choose to exert it, of dissolving the Union altogether. 
</p><p>
9. Multiplicity of laws 9. In developing the evils which viciate 
in the several States. t j ie political system of the United States, 
it is proper to include those which are found within the States 
individually, as well as those which directly affect the States 
collectively, since the former class have an indirect influence on 
the general malady, and must not be overlooked in forming a 
compleat remedy. Among the evils, then, of our situation, may 
well be ranked the multiplicity of laws, from which no State is 
exempt. As far as laws are necessary to mark with precision 
the duties of those who are to obey them, and to take from 
those who are to administer them a discretion which might be 
abused, their number is the price of liberty. As far as laws 
exceed this limit they are a nuisance; a nuisance of the most 
pestilent kind. Try the Codes of the several States by this 
test, and what a luxuriancy of legislation do they present. The 
short period of independency has filled as many pages as the 
century which preceded it. Every year, almost every session, 
adds a new volume. This may be the effect in part, but it can 
only be in part, of the situation in which the revolution has 
placed us. A review of the several Codes will shew that every 
necessary and useful part of the least voluminous of them might 
be compressed into one-tenth of the compass, and at the same 
time be rendered ten-fold as perspicuous. 
</p><p>
10. Mutability of the 10. This evil is intimately connected 
laws of the states. w jth the former, yet deserv. a distinct 
notice, as it emphatically denotes a vicious legislation. We 
daily see laws repealed or superseded before any trial can have 
been made of their merits, and even before a knowledge of them 
can have reached the remoter districts within which they were 
to operate. In the regulations of trade, this instability becomes 
a snare not only to our citizens, but to foreigners also. 
</p><p>
11. Injustice of the H- If the multiplicity and mutability of 
laws of the States. laws prove a want of wisdom, their injus
tice betrays a defect still more alarming; more alarming, not 
merely because it is a greater evil in itself, but because it brings 
more into question the fundamental principle of republican 
Government, that the majority who rule in such Governments 
are the safest guardians both of public good and of private 
rights. To what causes is this evil to be ascribed? 
</p><p>
These causes lie 1. In the representative bodies. 2. In the 
people themselves. 
</p><p>
1. Representative appointments are sought from 3 motives: 
1. Ambition. 2. Personal interest. 3. Public good. Unhappily, the two first are proved by experience to be most prevalent. Hence, the candidates who feel them, particularly the 
second, are most industrious and most successful in pursuing 
their object; and forming often a majority in the legislative 
Councils, with interested views, contrary to the interest and 
views of their constituents, join in a perfidious sacrifice of the 
latter to the former. A succeeding election, it might be supposed, would displace the offenders, and repair the mischief. 
But how easily are base and selfish measures masked by pretexts of public good and apparent expediency? How frequently will a repetition of the same arts and industry which 
succeeded in the first instance again prevail on the unwary to 
misplace their confidence? 
</p><p>
How frequently, too, will the honest but unenlightened representative be the dupe of a favorite leader, veiling his selfish 
views under the professions of public good, and varnishing his 
sophistical arguments with the glowing colours of popular eloquence? 
</p><p>
2. A still more fatal, if not more frequent cause, lies among 
the people themselves. All civilized societies are divided into 
different interests and factions, as they happen to be creditors 
or debtors, rich or poor, husbandmen, merchants, or manufacturers, members of different religious sects, followers of different political leaders, inhabitants of different districts, owners 
of different kinds of property, <fec., &c. In republican Government, the majority, however composed, ultimately give the law. 
Whenever, therefore, an apparent interest or common passion 
unites a majority, what is to restrain them from unjust violations of the rights and interests of the minority, or of individuals? Three motives only: 1. A prudent regard to their own 
good, as involved in the general and permanent good of the 
community. This consideration, although of decisive weight 
in itself, is found by experience to be too often unheeded. It is 
too often forgotten, by nations as well as by individuals, that 
honesty is the best policy. 2 dly . Respect for character. However strong this motive may be in individuals, it is considered 
as very insufficient to restrain them from injustice. In a multitude its efficacy is diminished in proportion to the number 
which is to share the praise or the blame. Besides, as it has 
reference to public opinion, which, within a particular society, 
is the opinion of the majority, the standard is fixed by those 
whose conduct is to be measured by it. The public opinion 
without the society will be little respected by the people at 
large of any Country. Individuals of extended views and of 
national pride may bring the public proceedings to this standard, but the example will never be followed by the multitude. 
Is it to be imagined that an ordinary citizen or even Assemblyman of R. Island, in estimating the policy of paper money, ever 
considered or cared in what light the measure would be viewed 
in France or Holland, or even in Massachusetts or Connecticut? It was a sufficient temptation to both that it was for 
their interest; it was a sufficient sanction to the latter that it 
was popular in the State; to the former, that it was so in the 
neighbourhood. 3 dly . Will Religion, the only remaining motive, be a sufficient restraint? It is not pretended to be such, 
on men individually considered. Will its eifect be greater on 
them considered in an aggregate view? Quite the reverse. 
The conduct of every popular assembly acting on oath, the 
strongest of religious ties, proves that individuals join without 
remorse in acts against which their consciences would revolt 
if proposed to them under the like sanction, separately, in their 
closets. When, indeed, Religion is kindled into enthusiasm, 
its force, like that of other passions, is increased by the sympathy of a multitude. But enthusiasm is only a temporary 
state of religion, and, while it lasts, will hardly be seen with 
pleasure at the helm of Government. Besides, as religion in 
its coolest state is not infallible, it may become a motive to 
oppression as well as a restraint from injustice. Place three 
individuals in a situation wherein the interest of each depends 
on the voice of the others, and give to two of them an interest 
opposed to the rights of the third. Will the latter be secure? 
The prudence of every man would shun the danger. The rules 
and forms of justice suppose and guard against it. Will two 
thousand in a like situation be less likely to encroach on the 
rights of one thousand? The contrary is witnessed by the notorious factions and oppressions which take place in corporate 
towns, limited as the opportunities are, and in little republics, 
when uncontrouled by apprehensions of external danger. If an 
enlargement of the sphere is found to lessen the insecurity of 
private rights, it is not because the impulse of a common interest or passion is less predominant in this case with the majority, but because a common interest or passion is less apt to be 
felt, and the requisite combinations less easy to be formed, by a 
great than by a small number. The society becomes broken 
into a greater variety of interests and pursuits of passions, 
which check each other, whilst those who may feel a common 
sentiment have less opportunity of communication and concert. 
It may be inferred that the inconveniences of popular States, 
contrary to the prevailing Theory, are in proportion not to the 
extent, but to the narrowness of their limits. 
</p><p>
The great desideratum in Government is such a modification 
of the sovereignty as will render it sufficiently neutral between 
the different interests and factions to controul one part of the 
society from invading the rights of another, and, at the same 
time, sufficiently controuled itself from setting up an interest 
adverse to that of the whole society. In absolute Monarchies 
the prince is sufficiently neutral towards his subjects, but frequently sacrifices their happiness to his ambition or his avarice. 
In small Republics, the sovereign will is sufficiently controuled 
from such a sacrifice of the entire Society, but is not sufficiently 
neutral towards the parts composing it. As a limited monarchy 
tempers the evils of an absolute one, so an extensive Republic 
meliorates the administration of a small Republic. 
</p><p>
An auxiliary desideratum for the melioration of the Republican form is such a process of elections as will most certainly 
extract from the mass of the society the purest and noblest 
characters which it contains; such as will at once feel most 
strongly the proper motives to pursue the end of their appointment, and be most capable to devise the proper means of attaining it.
