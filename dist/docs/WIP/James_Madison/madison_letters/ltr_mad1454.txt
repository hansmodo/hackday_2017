MY DEAR B., You moralize so prettily, that if I were to 
judge from some parts of your letter of October 13, I should 
take you for an old philosopher that had experienced the emptiness of earthly happiness; and I am very glad that you have 
so early seen through the romantic paintings with which the 
world is sometimes set off by the sprightly imaginations of the 
ingenious. You have happily supplied, by reading and observ.ion, the want of experiment; and therefore I hope you are 
sufficiently guarded against the allurements and vanities that 
beset us on our first entrance on the theatre of life. Yet, however nice and cautious we may be in detecting the follies of 
mankind, and framing our economy according to the precepts 
of Wisdom and Religion, I fancy there will commonly remain 
with us some latent expectation of obtaining more than ordinary happiness and prosperity till we feel the convincing argument of actual disappointment. Though I will not determine 
whether we shall be much the worse for it if we do not allow it 
to intercept our views towards a future state, because strong 
desires and great hopes instigate us to arduous enterprizes, 
fortitude, and perseverance. Nevertheless, a watchful eye must 
be kept on ourselves, lest while we are building ideal monuments of renown and bliss here, we neglect to have our names 
enrolled in the annals of Heaven. These thoughts come into 
my mind because I am writing to you, and thinking of you. 
As to myself, I am too dull and infirm now to look out for any 
extraordinary things in this world, for I think my sensations 
for many months past have intimated to me not to expect a 
long or healthy life; though it may be better with me after 
some time, [but] I hardly dare expect it, and therefore have 
little spirit and alacrity to set about anything that is difficult 
in acquiring and useless in possessing after one has exchanged 
time for eternity. But you have health, youth, fire, and genius, 
to bear you along through the high track of public life, and so 
may be more interested and delighted in improving on hints 
that respect the temporal though momentous concerns of man. 
</p><p>
I think you made a judicious choice of History and the science 
of morals for your winter's study. They seem to be of the 
most universal benefit to men of sense and taste in every post, 
and must certainly be of great use to youth in settling the 
principles and refining the judgment, as well as in enlarging 
knowledge and correcting the imagination. I doubt not but 
you design to season them with a little divinity now and then, 
which, like the philosopher's stone, in the hands of a good man, 
will turn them and every lawful acquirement into the nature of 
itself, and make them more precious than fine gold. 
</p><p>
As you seem to require that I should be open and unreserv., 
(which is indeed the only proof of true friendship,) I will 
venture to give you a word of advice, though it be more to 
convince you of my affection for you than from any apprehension of your needing it. Pray do not suffer those impertinent 
fops that abound in every city to divert you from your business 
and philosophical amusements. You may please them more by 
admitting them to the enjoyment of your company, but you 
will make them respect and admire you more by showing your 
indignation at their follies, and by keeping them at a becoming 
distance. I am luckily out of the way of such troubles, but I 
know you are surrounded with them; for they breed in towns 
and populous places as naturally as flies do in the shambles, 
because there they get food enough for their vanity and impertinence. 
</p><p>
I have undertaken to instruct my brothers and sisters in 
some of the first rudiments of literature; but it does not take 
up so much of my time but I shall always have leisure to 
receive and answer your, which are very grateful to me, 
I assure you; and for reading any performances you may be 
kind enough to send me, whether of Mr. Freneau or anybody 
else. I think myself happy in your correspondence, and desire 
you will continue to write as often as you can, as you see I 
intend to do by the early and long answer I send you. You 
are the only valuable friend I have settled in so public a place, 
and I must rely on you for an account of all literary transactions in your part of the world. 
</p><p>
I am not sorry to hear of Livingston's getting a degree. I 
heartily wish him well, though many would think I had but 
little reason to do so; and if he would be sensible of his opportunities and encouragements, I think he might still recover. 
Lucky (?) and his company, after their feeble yet wicked assault 
upon Mr. Erwin, in my opinion, will disgrace the catalogue of 
names ; but they are below contempt, and I spend no more 
words about them. 
</p><p>
And now, my friend, I must take my leave of you, but with 
such hopes that it will not be long before I receive another 
epistle from you, as make me more cheerfully conclude and 
subscribe myself 
</p><p>
Your sincere and affectionate friend. 
</p><p>
Your direction was right; however, the addition of " Jr." to 
my name would not be improper.
