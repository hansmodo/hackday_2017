TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>, Nov r 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1789">1789</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, It was my purpose to have dropped you a few 
lines from Philad*, but I was too much indisposed during my 
detention there to avail myself of that pleasure. Since my arrival here, I have till now been without a fit conveyance to the 
Post office. 
</p><p>
You will recollect the contents of a letter shewn you from 
Mr. Innes to Mr. Bf own. Whilst I was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> I was 
informed by the latter, who was detained there by indisposition, 
as well as myself, that he had received later accounts, tho' not 
from the same correspondent, that the Spaniards have finally 
put an entire stop to the trade of our citizens down the river. 
The encouragements to such as settle under their own Government are continued. 
</p><p>
A day or two after I got to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> I fell in with Mr. 
Morris. He broke the subject of the residence of Congress, and 
made observ.ions which betrayed his dislike of the upshot of 
the business at N. York, and his desire to keep alive the Southern project of an arrangement with Pennsylvania. I reminded 
him of the conduct of his State, and intimated that the question 
would probably sleep for some time in consequence of it. His 
answer implied that Congress must not continue at N". York, 
and that if he should be freed from his engagements with the 
Eastern States, by their refusal to take up the bill and pass it 
as it went to the Senate, he should renounce all confidence in 
that quarter, and speak serv.usly to the Southern States. I 
told him they must be spoken to very serv.usly after what had 
passed, if Pennsyl* expected them to listen to her; that, indeed^ 
there was probably an end to further intercourse on the subject. 
He signified that, if he should speak, it would be in earnest, and 
he believed that no one would pretend that his conduct would 
justify the least distrust of his going through with his undertakings; adding, however, that he was determined, and accordingly gave me, as he had -given others, notice that he should 
call up the postponed Bill as soon as Congress should be reas 
sembled. I observ. to him that if it were desirable to have 
the matter revived, we could not wish to have it in a form more 
likely to defeat itself. It was unparliamentary, and highly inconvenient; and would therefore be opposed by all candid 
friends to his object as an improper precedent, as well as by 
those who were opposed to the object itself. And if he should 
succeed in the Senate, the irregularity of the proceeding would 
justify the other House in withholding the signature of its 
Speaker, so that the Bill could never go up to the President. 
He acknowledged that the Bill could not be got through unless 
it had a majority of both Houses on its merits. Why, then, I 
asked, not take it up anew? He said he meant to bring the gentlemen who had postponed the Bill to the point, acknowledged 
that he distrusted them, but held his engagements binding on 
him until this final experiment should be made on the respect 
they meant to pay to theirs. I do not think it difficult to augur 
from this conversation the views which will govern Pennsyl* at 
the next Session. Conversations held by Grayson, both with 
Morris and others, in Philadel a , and left by him in a letter to 
me, coincide with what I have stated. An attempt will first 
be made to alarm N. York and the Eastern States into the plan 
postponed, by holding out the Potowmac and Philad 1 as the alternative; and if the attempt should not succeed, the alternative will then be held out to the Southern members. On the 
other hand, N. York and the Eastern States will enforce the 
policy of delay by threatening the Southern States, as heretofore, 
with Germantown or Trenton, or at least Susquehannah, and 
will no doubt carry the threat into execution if they can, rather 
than suffer an arrangement to take place between Pennsyl a and 
the Southern States. 
</p><p>
I hear nothing certain from the Assembly. It is said that 
</p><p>
an attempt of Mr. H y to revive the project of commutables 
</p><p>
has been defeated; that the amendments (to the federal Constitution) have been taken up and are likely to be put off to the 
next Session, the present House having been elected prior to 
the promulgation of them. This reason would have more force 
if the amendments did not so much correspond, as far as they 
go, with the propositions of the State Convention, which were 
before the public long before the last election. At any rate, 
the Assembly might pass a vote of approbation, along with the 
postponement, and assign the reason for referring the ratification to their successors. It is probable that the scruple has 
arisen with the disaffected party. If it be construed by the 
public into a latent hope of some contingent opportunity for promoting the war against the GEN'L Government, I am of opinion 
the experiment will recoil on the authors. As far as I can 
gather, the great bulk of the late opponents are entirely at rest, 
and more likely to censure a further opposition to the Government, as now administered, than the Government itself. One 
of the principal leaders of the Baptists lately sent me word that 
the amendments had entirely satisfied the disaffected of his sect, 
and that it would appear in their subsequent conduct. 
</p><p>
I ought not to conclude without some apology for so slovenly 
a letter. I put off writing it till an opportunity should present 
itself, not knowing but something from time to time might turn 
up that would make it less unworthy of your perusal. And it 
has so happened that the opportunity barely gives me time for 
this hasty scrawl.
