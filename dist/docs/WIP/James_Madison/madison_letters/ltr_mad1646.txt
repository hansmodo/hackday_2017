DEAR SIR, My last was of the 29th March. A few days ago 
I had the pleasure of yours of the 12 January. I thank you 
for your attention to the works of the Abbe BartheLemy and 
the Marquis Condorcet, and wish much that your attempts to 
procure me a genuine copy of the King of Prussia's may succeed. 
</p><p>
I send you herewith the first N . of the Congressional Register, which will give you some idea of the discussions in the 
new Legislature. You will see at once the strongest evidences 
of mutilation and perversion, and of the illiteracy of the Editor.

The following Numbers shall go after it, as conveyances occur, 
unless they should be found wholly unworthy of it. The deliberations of the House of Representatives have been chiefly employed on the subject of an Impost. Opinions have been considerably divided on the quantum of duties that would be practicable, and, in some instances, on the ratio of different duties 
likely to operate differently in different States that would be 
just. In general, the interests and ideas of the Northern and 
Southern States have been less adverse than was predicted by 
the opponents or hoped by the friends of the new Government. 
Members from the same State, or the same part of the Union, 
are as often separated on questions from each other as they are 
united in opposition to other States or other quarters of the 
continent. This is a favorable symptom. The points on which 
most controversy has been raised are: 1 st . The duty on molasses. 
2. The discrimination between nations in and those not in 
Treaty. The arguments against what appears a proportionate 
duty on molasses to that of rum turned on its disproportion to 
the value of the article; the effect on the trade in it, which 
yields the only market for certain exports from the Eastern 
States; the effect on the fisheries, in which both rum and molasses are consumed; and, finally, the effect on the poor in that 
part of the Union where the latter enters into their ordinary , 
diet. The opposite arguments have been, that a proportion to 
the duty on rum was essential to the productiveness of the fund, 
as well as to the rules of justice as applied to different States, 
some of which consume foreign and some country rum; that if 
the proportion was not violated, the trade in molasses could not 
be affected nor the distilleries injured; that the effect on the 
fisheries would be too small to be felt; and that the poor who 
consume molasses would escape the burden falling on the poor 
who consume sugar. By the inclosed printed resolutions you 
will see the rates on these articles as they yet stand. It is not 
improbable that further efforts will be made to reduce that on 
molasses. Some of the other rates have been altered since they 
were printed. I do not note them because they are not yet in 
their final state. It will become a serv.us question whether a 
general reduction of the rates shall be made or not, on the idea 
of the danger of smuggling. The distinction between nations 
in and not in Treaty has given birth to three distinct and 
urgent debates. On the last, the minority was very small for 
putting Great Britain at once on the same footing with the most 
favored nation. This policy, though patronized by some respectable names, is chiefly abetted by the spirit of this City, 
which is steeped in Anglicism. It is not improbable, from the 
urgency of its representative, that a further effort may be yet 
made.

Not knowing how far the present conveyance may be a certain one, I decline, on reflection, inclosing the Register until a 
more direct opportunity offers, when I will add sundry matters 
which I have not time now to put in cypher. Inclosed is the 
Speech of the President, with the Address of the House of Representatives, and his reply. You will see in the caption of the 
address that we have pruned the ordinary stile of the degrading 
appendages of Excellency, Esquire, &c., and restored it to its 
naked dignity. Titles to both the President and Vice President were formally and unanimously condemned by a vote of 
the House of Representatives. This, I hope, will shew to the 
friends of Republicanism that our new Government was not 
meant to substitute either Monarchy or Aristocracy, and that 
the genius of the people is as yet adverse to both.
