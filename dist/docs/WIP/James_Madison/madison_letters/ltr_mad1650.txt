DEAR SIR, ****** 
</p><p>
My last inclosed copies of the President's inaugural Speech, 
and the answer of the House of Representatives. I now add 
the answer of the Senate. It will not have escaped you that 
the former was addressed with a truly republican simplicity to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">George Washington</a>, President of the United States. The latter 
follows the example, with the omission of the personal name, 
but without any other than the Constitutional title. The proceeding on this point was, in the House of Representatives, 
spontaneous. The imitation by the Senate was extorted. The 
question became a serv.us one between the two Houses. J. 
Adams espoused the cause of titles with great earnestness. His 
friend, R. H. Lee, although elected as a Republican enemy to an 
aristocratic Constitution, was a most zealous second. The projected title was, his Highness the President of the United States 
and protector of their liberties. Had the project succeeded, it 
would have subjected the President to a severe dilemma, and 
given a deep wound to our infant Government. 
</p><p>
It is with much pleasure I inform you that Moustier begins 
to make himself acceptable; and with still more, that Madame 
Brehan begins to be viewed in the light which I hope she 
merits, and which was so little the case when I wrote by Master Morris. 
</p><p>
The collection bill is not yet passed. The duties have been 
settled in the House of Representatives, and are before the Senate; they produced a good deal of discussion, and called forth, 
in some degree, our local feelings. But the experiment has 
been favorable to our character for moderation, and, in general, 
the temper of the Congress seems to be propitious.
