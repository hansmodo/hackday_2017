TO COL. JAMES MADISON.

HON D Sm, The anti-federalists are everywhere exerting 
themselves for an early Convention. The circular letter from 
this State, and the rejection of North Carolina, give them great 
spirits. Virginia, I suppose, from the temper of the present 
Legislature, will co-operate in the plan. 
</p><p>
Congress have not yet settled the place for the meeting of 
the new Government. It is most probable that the advocates 
for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, who form at present the greater number, will 
prevail. In that case, although I think it a very unreasonable thing for the Southern and Western parts of the Union, the 
best face must be put on it.
