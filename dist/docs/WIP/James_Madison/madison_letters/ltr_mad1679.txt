DEAR SIR, The House of Representatives are still at the 
threshold of the Revenue business. The assumption of the State 
debts is the great obstacle. A few days ago it was reconsidered, and rejected by 31 against 29. The measure is not, however, abandoned. It will be tried in every possible shape by 
the zeal of its patrons. The Eastern members talk a strange 
language on the subject. They avow, some of them at least, a 
determination to oppose all provision for the public debt which 
does not include this, and intimate danger to the Union from a 
refusal to assume. We shall risk their prophetic menaces if we 
should continue to have a majority.
