DEAR SIR, The day fixed for the meeting of the Convention 
was the 14th ultimo. On the 25th, and not before seven States 
were assembled, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> was placed, una voce, in 
the chair. The secretaryship was given to Major Jackson. 
The members present are: from Massachusetts; Mr. Gerry, Mr. 
Gorham, Mr. King, Mr. Strong. From Connecticut; Mr. Sherman, Doctor S. Johnson, Mr. Ellsworth. From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>; 
Judge Yates, Mr. Lansing, Mr. Hamilton. New Jersey; Governor Livingston, Judge Brearley, Mr. Patterson, Attorney 
General; [Mr. Houston and Mr. Clarke are absent members.] 
From Pennsylvania; Dr. Franklin, Mr. Morris, Mr. Wilson, 
Mr. Fitzsimmons, Mr. G. Clymer, General Mifflin, Mr. Gouverneur Morris, Mr. Ingersoll. From Delaware; Mr. John Dickenson, Mr. Reed, Mr. Bedford, Mr. Broome, Mr. Bassett. From 
Maryland; Major Jenifer only. Mr. McHenry, Mr. Daniel 
Carroll, Mr. John Mercer, Mr. Luther Martin, are absent 
members. The three last have supplied the resignations of 
Mr. Stone, Mr. Carroll of Carrolton, and Mr. T. Johnson, as 
I have understood the case. From Virginia; <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a>, Governor Randolph, Mr. Blair, Col. Mason, Doctor 
McClurg, J. Madison. Mr. Wythe left us yesterday, being 
called home by the serv.us declension of his lady's health. 
From North Carolina; Col. Martin, late Governor, Doctor 
Williamson, Mr. Spaight, Col. Davy; Col. Blount is another 
member, but is detained by indisposition at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. From 
South Carolina; Mr. John Rutledge, General Pinckney, Mr. 
Charles Pinckney, Major Pierce Butler; Mr. Laurens is in 
the Commission from that State, but will be kept away by the 
want of health. From Georgia; Col. Few, Major Pierce, formerly of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a>, and aid to General Greene, Mr. Houston. Mr. Baldwin will be added to them in a few days. 
Welton and Pendleton are also in the deputation. New 
Hampshire has appointed Deputies, but they are not expected, 
the State treasury being empty, it is said, and a substitution of 
private resources being inconvenient or impracticable. I mention this circumstance to take off the appearance of backwardness, which that State is not in the least chargeable with, if we 
are rightly informed of her disposition. Rhode Island has not 
yet acceded to the measure. As their Legislature meet very 
frequently, and can at any time be got together in a week, it is possible that caprice, if no other motive, may yet produce a 
unanimity of the States in this experiment. 
</p><p>
In furnishing you with this list of names, I have exhausted 
all the means which I can make use of for gratifying your 
curiosity. It was thought expedient, in order to secure unbiassed discussion within doors, and to prevent misconceptions 
and misconstructions without, to establish some rules of caution, 
which will for no short time restrain even a confidential communication of our proceedings. The names of the members 
will satisfy you that the States have been serv.us in this business. The attendance of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> is a proof of the 
light in which he regards it. The whole community is big 
with expectation, and there can be no doubt but that the result 
will in some way or other have a powerful eifect on our 
destiny. 
</p><p>
Mr. Adams' book, which has been in your hands, of course 
has excited a good deal of attention. An edition has come out 
here, and another is in the press at N. York. It will probably 
be much read, particularly in the Eastern States, and contribute, 
with other circumstances, to revive the predelictions of this 
country for the British Constitution. Men of learning find 
nothing new in it; men of taste many things to criticise; and 
men without either, not a few things which they will not understand. It will, nevertheless, be read and praised, and become 
a powerful engine in forming the public opinion. The name 
and character of the author, with the critical situation of our 
affairs, naturally account for such an effect. The book also has 
merit, and I wish many of the remarks in it which are unfriendly to republicanism may not receive fresh weight from 
the operations of our governments. 
</p><p>
I learn from Virginia that the appetite for paper money 
grows stronger every day. Mr. Henry is an avowed patron 
of the scheme, and will not fail, I think, to carry it through, 
unless the County [Prince Edward] which he is to represent 
shall bind him hand and foot by instructions. I am told that 
this is in contemplation. He is also said to be unfriendly to an 
acceleration of Justice. There is good reason to believe that 
he is hostile to the object of the Convention, and that he wishes 
either a partition or total dissolution of the Confederacy. 
</p><p>
I sent you a few days ago, by a vessel going to France, a box 
with peccan nuts planted in it. Mr. John Vaughan was so 
good as to make arrangements with the captain, both for their 
preserv.ion during the voyage and the conveyance of them 
afterwards. I had before sent you, via England, a few nuts 
sealed up in a letter. 
</p><p>
Mr. Wythe gave me favorable accounts of your nephew in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a> ; and from the President of Hampden Sidney, 
who was here a few days ago, I received information equally 
pleasing of your younger nephew. 
</p><p>
I must beg you to communicate my affectionate respects to 
our friend Mazzei, and to let him know that I have taken every 
step for securing his claim on Dorman which I judged most 
likely to succeed. There is little doubt that Congress will 
allow him more than he owes Mr. Mazzei, and I have got from 
him such a draught on the Treasury board as I think will ensure 
him the chance of that fund. Dorman is at present in Virginia, 
where he has also some claims and expectations, but they are 
not in a transferable situation. I intended to have written to 
Mazzei, and must beg his pardon for not doing it. It is really 
out of my power at this time. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Yours affectionately.
