DEAR SIR * * * * * * 
I am sorry the development of the interesting subject before 
Congress had so little effect on the members. I did not see 
General St. Clair, and if I had, my acquaintance is too slender 
to have warranted my broaching a conversation with him. I 
have conferred freely with Mr. Wilson. What his ultimate 
opinion may be on a full view of the measure in its details, I 
cannot say. I think he is not unaware of strong objections 
against it, particularly as it tends to defeat the object of the 
meeting at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>, from which he has great expectations.
