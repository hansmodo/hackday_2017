DEAR SIR, The last favor for which I am to thank you is 
of June 9th. For some time past I have been obliged to content myself with inclosing you the newspapers. In general, they 
give, though frequently erroneous and sometimes perverted, yet, 
on the whole, fuller accounts of what is going forward than 
could be put into a letter. The papers now covered contain a 
sketch of a very interesting discussion which consumed great 
part of the past week. The Constitution has omitted to declare 
expressly by what authority removals from office are to be made. 
Out of this silence, four constructive doctrines have arisen: 1. 
That the power of removal may be disposed of by the Legislative discretion. To this it is objected that the Legislature 
might then confer it on themselves, or even on the House of 
Representatives, which could not possibly have been intended 
by the Constitution. 2. That the power of removal can only 
be exercised in the mode of impeachment. To this the objection is that it would make officers of every description hold 
their places during good behaviour, which could have still less 
been intended. 3. That the power of removal is incident to the 
power of appointment. To this the objections are that it would 
require the constant session of the Senate; that it extends the 
mixture of Legislative and Executive power; that it destroys 
the responsibility of the President, by enabling a subordinate 
Executive officer to intrench himself behind a party in the Senate, and destroys the utility of the Senate in their Legislative 
and Judicial characters, by involving them too much in the 
heats and cabals inseparable from questions of a personal nature; in fine, that it transfers the trust in fact from the President, who, being at all times impeachable, as well as every fourth 
year eligible by the people at large, may be deemed the most 
responsible member of the Government, to the Senate; which, 
from the nature of that institution, is and was meant, after the 
Judiciary, and in some respects without that exception, to be 
the most irresponsible branch of the Government. 4. That the 
Executive power being in general terms vested in the President, 
all power of an Executive nature not particularly taken away 
must belong to that department; that the power of appointment 
only being expressly taken away, the power of removal, so far 
as it is of an Executive nature, must be reserv.. In support 
of this construction it is urged that exceptions to general positions are to be taken strictly, and that the axiom relating to 
the separation of the Legislative and Executive functions ought 
to be favored. To this are objected the principle on which the 
3 d construction is founded, and the danger of creating too much 
influence in the Executive Magistrate. 
</p><p>
The last opinion has prevailed, but is subject to various modifications, by the power of the Legislature to limit the duration 
of laws creating offices, or the duration of the appointments for 
filling them, and by the power over the salaries and appropriations. In truth, the Legislative power is of such a nature that 
it scarcely can be restrained, either by the Constitution or by 
itself; and if the federal Government should lose its proper 
equilibrium within itself, I am persuaded that the effect will 
proceed from the encroachments of the Legislative department. 
If the possibility of encroachments on the part of the Executive 
or the Senate were to be compared, I should pronounce the danger to lie rather in the latter than the former. The mixture 
of Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary authorities, lodged in 
that body, justifies such an inference; at the same time, I am 
fully in the opinion that the numerous and immediate representatives of the people composing the other House will decidedly predominate in the Government. 
</p><p>
Mr. Page tells me he has forwarded to you a copy of the 
amendments lately submitted to the House of Representatives. 
They are restrained to points on which least difficulty was apprehended. Nothing of a controvertible nature ought to be 
hazarded by those who are sincere in wishing for the approbation of of each House, and | of the State Legislatures.
