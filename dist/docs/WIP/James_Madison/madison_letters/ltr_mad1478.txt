DEAR SIR, Having sent you the arguments on one side of 
the judiciary question relating to the property of Virginia 
seized by Mr. Nathan, it is but reasonable that you should see 
what was contended on the other side. With this view, although 
I in some measure usurp the task of Mr. Jones, I enclose the 
paper of Wednesday last. As it may escape Mr. Jones, I also 
enclose a copy of Mr. Adams's memorial to the States general. 
I wish I could have informed you of its being lodged in the 
archives of their High Mightinesses instead of presenting it to 
you in print. 
</p><p>
I am, Dr Sir, ys affectionately.
