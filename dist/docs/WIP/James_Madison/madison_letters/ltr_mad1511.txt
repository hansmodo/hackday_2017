DEAR SIR, I was yesterday honored with yours of the 28th 
ultimo, accompanying the Report of the Conferees, &c., &c. 
The latter has been laid before the House of Delegates, and a 
committee appointed to report a Bill and Eesolutions "corresponding with those of Maryland. The only danger of miscarriage arises from the impatience of the members to depart, and 
the bare competency of the present number. By great efforts 
only they have been detained thus long. I am not without 
hopes, however, that the business of the Potowmac at least will 
be provided for before the adjournment, and some provision now 
depending be compleated in favor of James River. Before the 
receipt of your dispatches a Bill had been passed by the House 
of Delegates for surveying the former as well as the latter river, 
on a plan which we shall endeavour, by concert with the Senate, to accommodate to the provisions of Maryland. A Resolution has passed both Houses instructing the Commissioners, 
appointed in June last to settle with Maryland Commissioners 
the jurisdiction of the Potowniac, to join in a representation to 
Pennsylvania on the subject of the waters of the Ohio within her 
limits. This instruction ought rather to have been committed to 
the late conference; but when the Commission, under which you 
attended it, passed, I was confined to my room, and it did not 
occur to any other member. And, indeed, if I had been well, the 
haste which necessarily prevailed might have precluded me from 
comprehending the object within your mission, especially as I 
had not previously digested my ideas on the subject, nor accurately examined the text of the Confederation. It were to be 
wished too, I think, that the application to Pennsylvania on the 
subject of the road could have been blended with that of the 
River. As it is, it will, I think, be best to refer it, after the 
example of Maryland, to the Executive. I beg you, Sir, to excuse the brevity which our hurry has imposed upon me. As 
soon as I have leisure, I will endeavour to make amends by a 
fuller communication on this subject.
