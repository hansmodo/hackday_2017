MY DEAR FRIEND, I have been favored with yours of the 
30th ultimo, and thank you for your remarks on the Judiciary 
bill. 
</p><p>
I am glad to find you concurring in the decision as to the 
power of removal. It seems to meet with general approbation 
North of Virginia, and there, too, as far as I yet learn. Mr. 
Pendleton is fully in opinion with you. So is Monroe, I am 
told. The more the question is weighed the more proper I think 
it will be found to reduce the ex-agency of the Senate to the 
very minimum that will satisfy the Constitution. To say nothing of their being the least responsible member of the Government, the nature of their other functions forbids an extension 
of their executive. As a judiciary body for impeachments, they 
ought not to be called on for a summary opinion in cases that 
may come judicially before them; and as a controul on the passions of the House of Representatives, they ought to have as 
little as possible to do with those personal questions, which are 
sources in all Governments of the most frequent and violent 
animosities and factions. The Senate have not yet declared 
themselves on the question. The event there is doubtful. 
</p><p>
You will find among the enclosed papers the impost act, as it 
finally passed. The Collection Bill is gone to the Senate. It 
is very long, has cost a great deal of trouble, and is by no means 
in a very correct state. It will do only to begin with. We endeavored to make the regulations for Virginia more palatable 
than the State laws, by relaxing the plan of the port Bills. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
