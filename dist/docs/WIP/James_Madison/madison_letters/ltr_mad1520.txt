DEAR SIR, Finding from a letter of Mr. Mazzei that you 
have never been furnished with a copy of the Bill for establishing the Christian Religion in this State, I now inclose one, 
regretting that I had taken it for granted that you must have 
been supplied through some other channel. A very warm opposition will -be made to this innovation by the people of the 
middle and back Counties, particularly the latter. They do 
not scruple to declare it an alarming usurpation on their fundamental rights, and that though the General Assembly should 
give it the form, they will not give it the validity of a law. If 
there be any limitation to the power of the Legislature, particularly if this limitation is to be sought in our Declaration of 
Rights or form of Government, I own the Bill appears to me to 
warrant this language of the people. 
</p><p>
. A gentleman of credit lately from Kentucky tells me that he 
fell in with two persons on the Ohio, who were going down the 
River in the character of Commissioners from Georgia, authorized to demand from the Spanish Governor of New Orleans the 
posts within the limits of that State, and a settlement of the 
boundary in general between it and the Spanish possessions. 
The Gentleman did not see their Commission, but entertains no 
doubt of their having one. He was informed that two others 
were joined in it, who had taken a different route. Should 
there be no mistake in this case, you will no doubt be able to 
get a full account of the Embassy. I would willingly suppose 
that no State could be guilty either of so flagrant an outrage 
on the federal Constitution, or of so imprudent a mode of pursuing their claims against a foreign nation. 
I observ.in a late Newspaper that the commercial discontents of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> are spreading to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 
Whether they will reach Virginia or not, I am unable to say. 
If they should, they must proceed from a different interest; from 
that of the planters, not that of the Merchants. The present 
system here is as favorable to the latter as it is ruinous to the 
former. Our trade was never more compleatly monopolized by 
Great Britain, when it was under the direction of the British 
Parliament, than it is at this moment. But as our Merchants 
are almost all connected with that Country, and that only, and 
as we have neither ships nor seamen of our own, nor likely to 
have any in the present course of things, no mercantile complaints are heard. The planters are dissatisfied, and with rea 
son; but they enter little into the science of commerce, and 
rarely of themselves combine in defence of their interests. If 
any thing could rouse them to a proper view of their situation, 
one might expect it from the contrast of the market here with 
that of other States. Our staple has of late been as low as a 
guinea per hundred on Rappahannock, and not above 32 or 33 
Shillings on James River. The current prices in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
during the same period have been 44 shillings of this currency 
for tobacco of the latter inspections, and in like proportion for 
that of the former. 
</p><p>
The prices of imports of every kind in those two markets 
furnish a contrast equally mortifying to us. I have not had the 
same information from other States northward of us, but I have 
little doubt that it would teach us the same lesson. Our planters 
cannot suffer a loss of less than fifty per cent, on the staple of 
the country, if to the direct loss in the price of the staple be 
added their indirect loss in the price of what they purchase 
with their staple. It is difficult, notwithstanding, to make them 
sensible of the utility of establishing a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> or* a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> among ourselves, as one indispensable step towards relief; and the difficulty is not a little increased by the pains 
taken by the merchants to prevent such a reformation, and by

the opposition arising from local views. I have been told that 
Arthur Lee paved the way to his election in Prince William by 
promising that, among other things, he would overset the Port 
bill. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> writes me that the Port Bill has been published in all the Gazettes in Europe, with the highest approbation every where except in Great Britain. It would indeed be 
as surprising if she should be in favor of it, as it is that any 
among ourselves should be against it. I see no possibility of 
engaging other nations in a rivalship with her without some 
such regulation of our commerce.
