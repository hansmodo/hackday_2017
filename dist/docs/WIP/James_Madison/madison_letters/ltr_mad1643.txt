DEAR SIR, You will not learn without some surprize that 
the sixth of this month arrived before a quorum was made up 
in both branches of the new Legislature, and the first of the 
month before a Quorum was attained in either. The first and 
only joint step taken by the Congress was the examination of 
the ballots for President and vice president. The votes were 
found, as was expected, to be unanimously given to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a>; and a sufficient number, though smaller than was 
expected, to give the secondary dignity to Mr. Adams. The 
entire number of votes was 69. Mr. Adams had 34 only. 
Governour Clinton had not a single vote except those of his 
three friends in Virginia. Mr. Charles Thomson set out yesterday as the herald to Mount Vernon, and a private gentleman 
with notice to the vice president. The Speaker of the House 
of Representatives is Mr. Muhlenburg, of Pennsylvania. The 
Clerk, Mr. Beckley. Mr. Langdon was placed in the chair of 
the Senate for the special purpose of opening the ballots, and 
will remain in it until Mr. Xdams arrives. The Clerk of that 
House is not yet appointed. 
</p><p>
I inclose a copy of the Rules agreed on yesterday. They are 
to receive a supplement as soon as prepared by a Committee. 
The first regular business to be discussed will relate to commerce, which is in a state of anarchy at present. Some propositions on that subject will be taken up to-morrow. It is thought 
proper that the preparatory work should be done before the arrival of the President. The subject of amendments has not yet 
been touched. From appearances there will be no great difficulty in obtaining reasonable ones. It will depend, however, 
entirely on the temper of the federalists, who predominate as 
much in both branches as could be wished. Even in this State, 
notwithstanding the violence of its anti-federal symptoms, three 
of its six representatives at least will be zealous friends to the 
Constitution; and it is not improbable that a fourth will be of 
the same description.

By a late British packet we understand that the King continues under his disability, though without mortal symptoms ; that 
the care of his person is committed to the Queen, and that the 
Prince of Wales is sole Regent by an act of the two Houses, 
but under certain limitations of power, which have produced 
a pointed and public discussion between him and Mr. Pitt.
