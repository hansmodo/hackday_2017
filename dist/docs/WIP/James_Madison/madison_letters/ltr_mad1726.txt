DEAR SIR, Your account of the ticklish situation with respect to Genet in the 14 th is truly distressing. His folly would 
almost beget suspicions of the worst sort. The consequences 
you point out, in case matters come to an extremity, are so certain and obvious, that it is hardly conceivable he can be blind 
to them. Something must be done, if possible, to get him into 
a better train. I find by the paper of the 27, that Pacificus has 
entered, and I suppose closed, his last topic. I think it a feeble 
defence of one important point I am striking at, viz: the making a declaration, in his sense of it, before the arrival of Genet. 
I argue that the act does not import a decision against the cas. 
fed., from the manifest impropriety of doing so, on the ground 
that France was the aggressor in every war, without, at least, 
waiting for evidence as to the question of fact who made the 
first attack, admitting, for the sake of argument, that to be the 
intention.
