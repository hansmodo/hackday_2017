DEAR SIR, Herewith inclosed are a letter for yourself, forwarded to my hands from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a>, and two others 
for the Marquis, one from the same quarter, the other from 
myself. I put both the last under cover to you, not knowing 
what regard may be due to newspaper authority that the Marquis is under the open displeasure of the court, and may therefore be the less likely to receivethrough any other 
channel. Sometimes the report runs that he is in the Bastile; 
at another, that he is at the head of a resome one of the 
Provinces.

My last have followed each other so quickly, and the 
last of all is of such recent date, that this opportunity by a 
gentleman going to France enables me to add but little to what 
has been already communicated. The result of the meeting at 
Harrisburg was the latest event worthy of notice at the date of 
my last. Nothing has since taken place in relation to the new 
Government but the appointment of Mr. Robert Morris and 
Mr. Maclay to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate. A law 
has also passed in that State providing for the election of members for the House of Representatives, and of electors of the 
President. The act proposes that every citizen throughout the 
State shall vote for the whole number of members allotted to 
the State. This mode of election will confine the choice to 
characters of general notoriety, and so far be favorable to 
merit. It is, however, liable to some popular objections urged 
against the tendency of the new system. In Virginia, I am 
inclined to think, the State will be divided into as many districts 
as there are to be members. In other States, as in Connecticut, 
the Pennsylvania example will probably be followed. And in 
others, again, a middle course be taken. It is, perhaps, to be 
desired that various modes should be tried, as by that means 
only the best mode can be ascertained. 
</p><p>
There is no doubt that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> will be called to 
the Presidency. For the vice Presidency are talked of principally Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams. Mr. Jay or General Knox 
would, I believe, be preferred to either, but both of them will 
probably chuse to remain where they are. It is impossible to 
say which of the former would be preferred, or what other candidates may be brought forward.

I have a letter from Mr. George Lee Turberville, of Virginia, 
requesting me to mention to you a report proceeding from 
Greenwich, that a Doctor Spence and his lady (the former a 
Virginian, of respectable family, in the lower end of the Northern neck, and whose mother is still living in a second marriage 
with a Doctor Thomson, of Westmoreland County) were captured on their way to Virginia, and carried into Algiers. This 
event is said to have happened seven or eight years ago, though 
discovered but lately, it having been taken for granted that the 
vessel and all on board had perished at sea. I am much inclined to believe that this supposition is the true one, and that 
the Greenwich story has no foundation. I communicate it, 
nevertheless, as requested by Mr. Turberville, that you may have 
an opportunity of collecting for the friends of Doctor Spence 
any information which may be interesting to them, and of taking 
any steps that such information may suggest in behalf of the 
distressed.
