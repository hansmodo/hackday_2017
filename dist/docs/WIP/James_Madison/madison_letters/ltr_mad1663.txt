DEAR SIR, The pressure of unfinished business has suspended the adjournment of Congress till Saturday next. Among the 
articles which required it was the plan of amendments, on which 
the two Houses so far disagreed as to require conferences. It 
will be impossible, I find, to prevail on the Senate to concur 
in the limitation on the value of appeals to the Supreme Court, 
which they say is unnecessary, and might be embarrassing in 
questions of national or Constitutional importance in their principle, though of small pecuniary amount. They are equally inflexible in opposing a definition of the locality of Juries. The 
vicinage they contend is either too vague or too strict a term; 
too vague if depending on limits to be fixed by the pleasure of 
the law, too strict if limited to the county. It was proposed to 
inserv.after the word Juries, " with the accustomed requisites," 
leaving the definition to be construed according to the judgment 
of professional men. Even this could not be obtained. The 
truth is, that in most of the States the practice is different, and 
hence the irreconcileable difference of ideas on the subject. In 
some States, jurors are drawn from the whole body of the community, indiscriminately; in others, from large districts comprehending a number of Counties; and in a few only from a 
single County. The Senate suppose, also, that the provision 
for vicinage in the Judiciary bill will sufficiently quiet the 
fears which called for an amendment on this point. On a few 
other points in the plan the Senate refuse to join the House of 
Representatives.

The bill establishing the permanent seat of Government has 
passed the House of Representatives in favour of the Susquehannah. Some of the Southern members despaired so much of 
ever getting anything better, that they feil into the majority. 
Even some of the Virginians leaned that way. My own judgment was opposed to any compromise, on the supposition that 
we had nothing worse to fear than the Susquehannah, and could 
obtain that at any time, either by uniting with the Eastern States 
or Pennsylvania. The bill, however, is by no means sure of 
passing the Senate in its present form. It is even possible that 
it may fall altogether. Those who wish to do nothing at this 
time, added to those who disapprove of the Susquehannah, either 
as too far South or too far North, or not susceptible of early 
conveniences for the fiscal administration, may form a majority 
who will directly or indirectly frustrate the measure. In case 
of an indirect mode, some other place will be substituted for 
Susquehannah, as Trenton or Germantown, neither of which 
can, I conceive, be effectually established, and either of which 
might get a majority composed of sincere and insidious votes.

The inclosed papers contain very interesting accounts from 
France. I have a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> of July 22 and 23, 
confirming the substance of them. -The King has thrown himself finally on his people, recalled Neckar, dismissed the troops, 
and, in short, given a Carte Blanche to the National Assembly, 
who are at work in forming a regular Constitution. The tumults in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> have been dreadful, but at the same time mixed 
with a steady attention to the main object. The City has 
formed a Militia and put Fayette at the head, and committees 
of safety according to the American model.
