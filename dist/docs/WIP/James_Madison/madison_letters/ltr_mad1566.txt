HON'D SlR, The general attention is now directed towards 
the approaching Convention. All the States have appointed 
deputies to it except Connecticut, Maryland, and Rhode Island. 
The first, it is not doubted, will appoint, and the second has 
already resolved on the expediency of the measure. Rhode 
Island alone has refused her concurrence. A majority of more 
than twenty in the Legislature of that State has refused to follow the general example. Being conscious of the wickedness 
of the measures they are pursuing, they are afraid of everything 
that may become a controul on them. Notwithstanding this 
prospect of a very full and respectable meeting, no very sanguine expectations can well be indulged. The probable diversity of opinions and prejudices, and of supposed or real interests among the States, renders the issue totally uncertain. The 
existing embarrassments and mortal diseases of the Confederacy 
form the only ground of hope that a spirit of concession on all 
sides may be produced by the general chaos, or at least partitions of the Union, which offers itself as the alternative.
