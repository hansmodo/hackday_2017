SIR, The delay in acknowledging your letter of the 6th 
June last proceeded from the cause you conjectured. I did not 
receive it till a few days ago, when it was put into my hands 
by Mr. James Pemberton, along with your subsequent letter of 
the 8th August. 
</p><p>
The petition relating to the Militia bill contains nothing that 
makes it improper for me to present it. I shall, therefore, readily comply with your desire on that subject. I am not satisfied 
that I am equally at liberty with respect to the other petition. 
Animadversions such as it contains, and which the authorized 
object of the petitioners did not require, on the slavery existing 
in our country, are supposed by the holders of that species of 
property to lessen the value by weakening the tenure of it. 
Those from whom I derive my public station are known by me 
to be greatly interested in that species of property, and to view 
the matter in that light. It would seem that I might be chargeable at least with want of candour, if not of fidelity, were I to 
make use of a situation in which their confidence has placed me 
to become a volunteer in giving a public wound, as they would 
deem it, to an interest on which they set so great a value. I 
am the less inclined to disregard this scruple as I am not sensible that the event of the petition would in the least depend on 
the circumstance of its being laid before the House by this or 
that person. 
</p><p>
Such an application as that to our own Assembly, on which 
you ask my opinion, is a subject, in various respects, of great 
delicacy and importance. The consequences of every sort ought 
to be well weighed by those who would hazard it. From the 
view under which they present themselves to me, I cannot but 
consider the application as likely to do harm rather than good. 
It may be worth your own consideration whether it might not 
produce successful attempts to withdraw the privilege now allowed to individuals, of giving freedom to slaves. It would at 
least be likely to clog it with a condition tliat the persons 
freed should be removed from the country; there being arguments of great force for such a regulation, and some would concur in it, who, in general, disapprove of the institution of 
slavery. 
</p><p>
I thank you, sir, for the friendly sentiments you have expressed towards me, and am, with respect, your obt, humble serv. 
</p>
