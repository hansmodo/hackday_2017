<p>
TO COL. JAMES MADISON.

We have heard little of late from Europe, except that the 
mediation proffered by Russia in the dispute between England 
and Holland has been referred by the former to the general 
pacification, in which the mediation of the Emperor will be 
joined with that of Russia. As this step is not very respectful 
to Russia, it can only proceed from a distrust of her friendship, 
and the hopes entertained by Britain as to the issue of the campaign, which, as you will see in an intercepted letter from Germaine to Clinton, were extravagantly sanguine. We have no 
late intelligence from the West Indies. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> 
is going on with his preparations and operations against New 
York. What the result will be can be decided by time alone. 
We hope they will at least withdraw some of the invaders from 
Virginia. The French fleet is still at Rhode Island. The 
British, it is reported, has lately left the Hook.

August 2. Information has been received from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, 
through a channel which is thought a good one, that orders are 
gone to Virginia for a large part of the troops under Cornwallis immediately to sail for that place. Should this be well 
founded, the execution of the orders will announce it to you. 
Among other advantages attending an evacuation of Virginia, 
it will not be the least that the communication with this place 
by the bay will supply the State with many necessary articles 
which are now transported by land at so much expense, and 
will enable you to pay for them easier by raising the price of 
your commodities. It gives me pain to hear that so many of 
the people have incautiously sold, or rather given away, their 
tobacco to speculators, when it was in no danger from the 
enemy. The destruction of that article, which alarmed them, 
was an obvious cause of its future rise, and a reason for their 
retaining it till the alarm should be over. Goods of all kinds, 
particularly dry goods, are rising here already. Salt, in particular, has risen within a few days from two dollars to a guinea 
per bushel.
