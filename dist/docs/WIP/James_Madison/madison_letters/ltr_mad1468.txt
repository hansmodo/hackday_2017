TO HON. EDMUND PENDLETON, CAROLINE COUNTY, VIRGINIA. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">PHILADELPHIA</a>, November 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>.

DR SIR, Your favor of the 6th instant came to hand yesterday. Mr. Griffin, by whom you appear also to have written, 
has not yet arrived. 
</p><p>
It gives me great pleasure to find that the enemy's numbers 
are so much less formidable than was at first computed; but 
the information from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> makes it not improbable that 
the blank in the computation may shortly be filled up. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> wrote to Congress on the 4th instant that another 
embarkation was going on at that place, and in another letter 
of the 7th he says that, although he had received no further 
intelligence on the subject, he had reason still to believe that 
such a measure was in contemplation. Neither the amount nor 
the object of it, however, had been ascertained. 
</p><p>
The inroads of the enemy on the frontier of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> have 
been distressing and wasteful almost beyond their own example. 
They have totally laid in ashes a fine settlement called Schoharie, 
which was capable, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> says, of yielding no 
less than 80,000 bushels of grain for public consumption. Such 
a loss is inestimable, and is the more to be regretted because 
both local circumstances and the energy of that Government 
left little doubt that it would have been applied to public use. 
</p><p>
I fancy the taking of Quebec was a mere invention. Your 
letter gave me the first account of such a report. A different 
report concerning the second division of the French fleet has 
sprung up, as you will see by the enclosed paper. It is believed 
here by many, and some attention given to it by all. It is also 
said that Rodney has sailed from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> with twenty ships 
for Europe. If he has sailed at all, and the first report be true 
also, it is more likely that he has gone out to meet the French. 
</p><p>
The late exchange has liberated about one hundred and forty 
officers and all our privates at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, amounting to four 
hundred and seventy-six. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> has acceded 
to a proposal of a further exchange of the convention officers 
without attaching any privates to them, which will liberate 
almost the whole residue of our officers at that place. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with the highest esteem and regard, your obt friend 
and serv. 
</p>
