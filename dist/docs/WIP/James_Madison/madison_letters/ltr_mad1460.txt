<p>
TO MR. WILLIAM BRADFORD. 
</p><p>
VIRGINIA, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> COUNTY, January 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>.

MY WORTHY FRIEND, Your very acceptable favors by Mr. 
Rutherford arrived safe, but I perceived by the date had a 
very tedious passage, which perhaps may be attributed to the 
craziness of the vessel in which you embarked them. I ought 
to mention, in particular, that I did not receive them till after 
I wrote my last, as an apology for my not then acknowledging it. 
</p><p>
I entirely acquiesce in your opinion of our friend Brackenridge's talents, and think his poem an indubitable proof of what 
you say on that head. It certainly has many real beauties in 
it, and several strokes of a strong original genius; but at the 
same time, as you observ. some very obvious defects, which I 
am afraid, too, are more discernible to common readers than its 
excellencies. If this be the case, I am apprehensive it will not 
answer the end proposed, which, as I collect from his letter to 
me, was to raise the character of his academy by the fame of 
its teacher. It is on this account, he says, he desires it might 
have a pretty general reading in this Government. For my 
own part, I could heartily wish, for the honor of the author and 
the success of the performance, that it might fall into the hands 
only of the impartial and judicious. I have shewn it to some 
of our middling sort of folks, and I am persuaded it will be not 
much relished by that class of my countrymen. The subject is 
itself frightful; blank verse, in some measure unintelligible, at 
least requires stricter attention than most people will bestow; 
and the antiquated phraseology, however eligible in itself, disgusts such as affect modern fashion. In short, the theme is not 
interesting enough, nor the dress sufficiently a la mode to attract 
the notice of the generality. The same merit in a political 
or humorous composition would have rung the author's fame 
through every Province on the continent. Something of this 
kind I am encouraged to expect soon from a passage of his letter in which he mentions a design of finishing a poem then in 
hand, on the present times; and from the description he gives 
of it, (if it be not too local,) I doubt not will meet with the 
public's applause. He informed me it would be ready for the 
press in three months from the time he wrote. If so, you must 
have seen it by this time. 
</p><p>
We are very busy at present in raising men and procuring 
the necessaries for defending ourselves and our friends in case 
of a sudden invasion. The extensiveness of the demands of the 
Congress, and the pride of the British nation, together with the 
wickedness of the present ministry, seem, in the judgment of our 
politicians, to require a preparation for extreme events. There 
will, by the Spring I expect, be some thousands of well-trained, 
high-spirited men ready to meet danger whenever it appears, 
who are influenced by no mercenary principles, but bearing 
their own expenses, and having the prospect of no recompense 
but the honor and safety of their country. 
</p><p>
I suppose the inhabitants of your Province are more reserv. 
in their behavior, if not more easy in their apprehension, from 
the prevalence of Quaker principles and politics. The Quakers 
are the only people with us who refuse to accede to the Continental association. I cannot forbear suspecting them to be 
under the control and direction of the leaders of the party in 
your quarter; for I take those of them that we have to be too 
honest and simple to have any sinister or secret views, and I 
do not observ.anything in the association inconsistent with 
their religious principles. When I say they refuse to accede to 
the association, my meaning is that they refuse to sign it; that 
being the method used among us to distinguish friends from 
foes, and to oblige the common people to a more strict observ.ce of it. I have never heard whether the like method has 
been adopted in the other Governments. 
</p><p>
I have not seen the following in print, and it seems to be so 
just a specimen of Indian eloquence and mistaken valor, that I 
think you will be pleased with it. You must make allowance 
for the unskilfulness of the interpreters.

The speech of Logan, a Shawanese Chief, to Lord Dunmore: 
" I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's 
cabin hungry, and I gave him not meat; if ever he came cold or 
naked, and I gave him not clothing. During the course of the 
last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his tent, an 
advocate for peace; nay, such was my love for the whites, that 
those of my own country pointed at me as they passed by, and 
said, ' Logan is the friend of white men.' I had even thought 
to live with you but for the injuries of one man. Col. Cressop, 
the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked, cut off all the 
relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. 
There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any human 
creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it; I 
have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my 
country I rejoice at the beams of peace; but do not harbor a 
thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. 
He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to 
mourn for Logan ? not one ! "

If you should see any of our friends from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">PRINCETON</a> a little 
before the time of your intending to write to me, and could 
transmit any little intelligence concerning the health, &c., of my 
little brother there, it would be very acceptable to me, and very 
gratifying to a fond mother; but I desire it may only be done 
when it will cost you less than five words.

We had with us a little before Christmas the Rev. Moses 
Allen, on his return from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> to Charlestown. He told me 
he came through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, but did not see you, though he expresses a singular regard for you, and left his request with me 
that you would let him hear from you whenever it is convenient, 
promising to return the kindness with punctuality. He travelled with considerable equipage for a dissenting ecclesiastic, 
and seems to be willing to superadd the airs of the fine gentleman to the graces of the spirit. I had his company for several 
days, during which time he preached two serv.ns with general 
approbation. His discourses were above the common run some 
degree; and his appearance in the pulpit on the whole was no 
</p><p>
discredit to [ ?] He retains too much of his pristine 
</p><p>
levity, but promises amendment. I wish he may for the sake 
of himself, his friends, and his flock. I only add that he seems 
to be one of those geniuses that are formed for shifting in the 
world rather than shining in a college, and that I really believe 
him to possess a friendly and generous disposition. 
</p><p>
You shall ere long hear from me again. Till then, Five, 
vole et Loetare.

HON. SIR ******* 
</p><p>
It is impossible for me to say when the Convention will adjourn; but am pretty certain it will not be so soon as was 
expected when I wrote by . 
</p><p>
It is said that seven ships, some of them very large, have 
within a few days past come to the aid of Dunmore. Whether 
they be transports or ships of war is not yet determined. 
I am, dear sir, yours affectionately.
