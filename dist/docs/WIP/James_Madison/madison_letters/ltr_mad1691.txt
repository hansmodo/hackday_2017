DEAR Sr * * * * * * * 
I send you herewith a copy of Priestley's answer to Burke, 
which has been reprinted here. You will see by a note, page 
56, how your idea of limiting the right to bind posterity is 
germinating under the extravagant doctrines of Burke on that 
subject. Paine's answer has not yet been received here. The 
moment it can be got, Freneau tells me it will be published in 
Childs' paper. It is said that the pamphlet has been suppressed 
in England, and that the author withdrew to France before or 
immediately after its appearance. This may account for his 
not sending copies to his friends in this country.

From conversations which I have casually heard, it appears 
that among the enormities produced by the spirit of speculation 
and fraud, a practice is spreading of taking out administration 
on the effects of deceased soldiers and other claimants leaving 
no representatives. By this knavery, if not prevented, a prodigious sum will be unsaved by the public, and reward the 
worst of its citizens. A number of adventurers are already 
engaged in the pursuit, and as they easily get security as administrators, and as easily get a commission on the usual suggestion of being creditors, they desire nothing more than to 
ascertain the name of the party deceased or missing, trusting 
to the improbability of their being detected or prosecuted by 
the public. It cannot but have happened, and is, indeed, a fact 
well understood, that the unclaimed dues from the United States 
are of very great amount. What a door is here open for collusion also, if any of the clerks in the account offices are not 
proof against the temptation ?

We understood in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> that during the suspension 
of the Bank bill in the hands of the President, its partizans here 
indulged themselves in reflections not very decent. I have reason 
to believe that the licentiousness of the tongues of speculators 
and Tories far exceeded anything that was conceived. The 
meanest motives were charged on him, and the most insolent 
menaces held over him, if not in the open streets, under circumstances not less marking the character of the party.

In returning a visit to Mr. King yesterday, our conversation 
fell on the conduct of Great Britain towards the United States, 
which he evidently laments as much as he disapproves. He 
took occasion to let me understand, that although he had been 
averse to the appearance of precipitancy in our measures, he 
should readily concur in them after all probability should be 
over of voluntary relaxations in the measures of the other 
party; and that the next session of Congress would present 
such a crisis if nothing to prevent it should intervene. He 
mentioned, also, that a young gentleman here (a son of W. 
Smith, now Chief Justice of Canada) gives out, as information 
from his friends in England, that no Minister will be sent to 
this country until one shall have previously arrived there. 
What credit may be due to this person or his informers I do 
not know. It shews, at least, that the conversation and expectations which lately prevailed are dying away.
