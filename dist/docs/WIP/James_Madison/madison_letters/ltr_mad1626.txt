DEAR SIR, I send you the enclosed paper chiefly for the 
sake of the edict, which fixes on May for the meeting of the 
States General in Francefrom <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> authenticate the document. They mention also the disgrace, as it is 
called, of the Marquis. The struggle at present, in that kingdom, seems to be entirely between the monarchy and aristocracy, 
and the hopes of the people merely in the competition of their 
enemies for their favour. It is probable, however, that both 
the parties contain real friends to liberty, who will make events 
subserv.nt to their object. 
</p><p>
The Count Moustier and the Marchioness Brehan are to set 
out this day for Mount Vernon. I take it for granted you are 
not only apprised of the intended visit, but of the time at which 
the guests may be expected. 
The State of Connecticut has made choice of Doct r Johnson 
and Mr. Ellsworth for its Senators, and has referred that of its 
representatives to the people at large; every individual citizen 
to vote for every Representative. 
</p><p>
I have not heretofore acknowledged your last favor, nothing 
material having turned up for some time, and the purpose of 
Col. Carrington to see you on his way to Virginia superseding 
all the ordinary communications through the epistolary channel. 
</p><p>
It gives me much pleasure to find that both the opposition, at 
first, and finally the accession, to the vote fixing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> for 
the first meeting of the new Congress, has your approbation. 
My fears that the measure would be made a handle of by the 
opposition are confirmed in some degree by my late information 
from Virginia. Mr. Pendleton, the chancellor, tells me he has 
already met taunts from that quarter on this specimen of Eastern equity and impartiality. Whether much noise will be made, 
will depend on the policy which Mr. Henry may find it convenient to adopt. As <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> is at the head of his party, he 
may be induced by that circumstance not to make irritating 
reflections; though the fact is, that the party in this State which 
is with him is supposed to be indifferent, and even secretly 
averse, to the residence of Congress here. This, however, may 
not be known to him. 
</p><p>
I am, Dear Sir, yours most respectfully and affecte'y .
