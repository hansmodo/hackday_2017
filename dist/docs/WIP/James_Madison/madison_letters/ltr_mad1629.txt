MY DEAR FRIEND, Your two favors of the 5th and 10th instant have been duly received. The appointments for the Senate, communicated in the latter, answer to the calculations I 
had formed, notwithstanding the contrary appearances on which 
the former was founded. My only surprise is, that in the present temper and disproportionate number of the anti-federal part 
of the Assembly, my name should have been honored with so 
great a vote as it received. When this circumstance is combined with that of the characters which I have reason to believe 
concurred in it, I should be justly chargeable with a very mistaken ambition if I did not consider the event in the light which 
you anticipated. I shall not be surprised if the attempt should 
be equally successful to shut the door of the other House against 
me, which was the real object of my preference, as well for the 
reason formerly suggested to you, as for the additional one that 
it will less require a stile of life with which my circumstances 
do not square, and for which an inadequate provision only will 
probably be made by the public. Being not yet acquainted 
with the allotment of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> in the districts, I can form no estimate of the reception that will be given to an offer of my serv.es. The district in which I am told it is likely to be thrown, 
for the choice of an Elector, is a very monitory sample of what 
may and probably will be done in that way. 
</p><p>
My present situation embarrasses me somewhat. When I 
left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I not only expected that the choice for the 
Senate would be as it is, but was apprehensive that the spirit 
of party might chuse to add the supposed mortification of dropping my name from the deputation to Congress for the fraction 
of a year remaining. I accordingly left that place under arrangements which did not require my return. At the same 
time, I had it in view, if left entirely to my option, to pass the 
winter or part of it there, being desirous of employing some 
of the time in matters which need access to the papers of Congress, and supposing, moreover, that I should be there master 
more of my time than in Virginia. The opportunity of executing my plan is given me, I find, by one of the votes of the Assembly. On the other hand, I am now pressed by some of my 
friends to repair to Virginia, as a requisite expedient for counteracting the machinations against my election into the House 
of Representatives. To this, again, I am extremely disinclined, 
for reasons additional to the one above mentioned. It will 
have an electioneering appearance,, which I always despised and 
wish to shun. And as I should shew myself in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> only, 
where there will probably be little difficulty, my presence could 
have no very favorable effect; whilst it is very possible that 
such a mark of solicitude, strengthened by my not declining a 
reappointment to Congress, and now declining to serv.in it, 
might, by a dexterous misinterpretation, be made to operate on 
the other side. These considerations are strong inducements 
to join my colleagues at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and leave things to their 
own course in Virginia. If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> should fall into a federal 
district, it is probable I shall not be opposed; if otherwise, a 
successful opposition seems unavoidable. My decision, however, is not finally taken.
