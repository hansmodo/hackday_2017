MY DEAR FRIEND, Your favor of the 15th, which requests 
an immediate acknowledgment, by some irregularity did not 
come to hand till I had received that of the 18th, nor till it 
was too late to comply with the request by the last mail. I 
have been so unlucky, also, as to miss seeing the President 
</p><p>

twice that I have waited on him, in order to intimate the circumstances which you wish him to know. I shall continue to 
repeat my efforts until I shall have an opportunity of executing 
your commands. 
</p><p>
The House have recommitted the Resolutions on the report 
of the Treasury. Those relating to the assumption of State 
debts were recommitted by a majority of two votes. The 
others, from an extreme repugnance in many to a separation of 
the two subjects. N. Carolina has 2 votes on the floor, which 
turned the scale. The final decision is precarious. The immediate decision will repeal the former one in favour of the assumption, unless the composition of the House or the Committee 
should be varied to-morrow. Of six absent members, a majority 
will be opposed to the measure.
