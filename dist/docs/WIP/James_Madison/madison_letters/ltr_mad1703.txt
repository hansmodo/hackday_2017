MY DEAR SIR, I have your favor of the 29th ultimo. The 
Senate have disagreed to that part of the Military Bill which 
augmented the regular establishment to about 5,000 men, and 
will probably send it back with that alteration. They prefer 
a completion only of the old Regiments, and a liberal provision 
for temporary forces. Nothing has passed from which I can 
conjecture, in the most remote degree, whether you may have to 
decide the point on which I consulted you. It was, as I observ. to you, a mere contingency suggested by my own reflections, and so continues. The moment I discover what is meant 
to be done on that subject, whether correspondent with my own 
ideas, or not, I shall drop you notice, as you desire. 
With respect to the light in which an exchange of Station* 
might be regarded within the State, it is not possible for me to 
judge so well as others. I feel the delicacy involved in your 
contemplation of the subject. Perhaps this may be one of the 
cases in which your own feelings will be the best counsellor.

The papers herewith inclosed will give you the current information, both foreign and domestic. Cornwallis and Tippbo 
cut the principal figure in those of latest date. The situation 
of the former is more problematical than it was a few months 
before the siege of York. An assumption of the State debts is 
reported, and printed for the members. The motive of State 
interest in its favor, it appears, can be felt only by about onethird of the house, and yet I shall not be much surprised if the 
measure be carried.
