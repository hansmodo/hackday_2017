DEAR SIR, We got through the Constitution by paragraphs 
to-day. To-morrow, some proposition for closing the business 
will be made. On our side, a ratification, involving a few declaratory truths not affecting its validity, will be tendered. 
The opposition will urge previous amendments. Their conversation to-day seemed to betray despair. Col. Mason, in particular, talked in a style which no other sentiment could have 
produced. He held out the idea of civil convulsions as the 
effects of obtruding the Government on the people. He was 
answered by several, and concluded with declaring his determination for himself, to acquiesce in the event whatever it might 
be. Mr. Henry endeavored to gloss what had fallen from his 
friend; declared his aversion to the Constitution to be such that 
he could not take the oath; but that he would remain in peaceable submission to the result. We calculate on a majority, but 
a bare one. It is possible, nevertheless, that some adverse circumstance may happen.

I am, dear Sir, in haste, yrs entirely.
