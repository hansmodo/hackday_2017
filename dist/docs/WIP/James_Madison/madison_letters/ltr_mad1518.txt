DEAR SIR, I have written several within a little time 
past, which were sent to you partly by the post, partly by Mr. 
Burnley, a young gentleman of this county. In one of the letters I enclosed a cypher, which will serv.all the purposes of 
our future correspondence. This covers a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>, which you will be so good as to forward by the first 
packet or other equally eligible conveyance. Our elections, as 
far as I hear, are likely to produce a great proportion of new 
members. In some counties they are influenced by the Bill for 
a general assessment. In Culpeper, Mr. Pendleton, a worthy 
man, and acceptable in his general character to the people, was 
laid aside in consequence of his vote for the Bill, in favor of an 
adversary to it. The delegates from Albemarle are your friend 
Mr. W. C. Nicholas and Mr. Fry. Mr. Carter stood a poll, but 
fell into the rear. The late Governor Harrison, I am told, has 
been baffled in his own County, meant to be a candidate for 
Surry, and in case of a rebuff there to throw another die for 
the Borough of Norfolk. I do not know how he proposes to 
satisfy the doctrine of residence.

I hear frequent complaints of the disorders of our coin, and 
the want of uniformity in the denominations of the States. Do 
not Congress think of a remedy for these evils? The regulation of weights and measure seem also to call for their attention. Every day will add to the difficulty of executing these 
works. If a mint be not established and a recoinage effected 
while the federal debts carry the money through the hands of 
Congress, I question much whether their limited powers will 
ever be able to render this branch of their prerogative effectual. 
With regard to the regulation of weights and measures, would 
it not be highly expedient, as well as honorable to the federal 
administration, to pursue the hint which has been suggested by 
ingenious and philosophical men, to wit: that the standard of 
measure should be first fixed by the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds at the Equator or any given latitude; and that the 
standard of weights should be a cubical piece of gold, or other 
homogeneous body, of dimensions fixed by the standard of 
measure? Such a scheme appears to be easily reducible to practice; and as it is founded on the division of time, which is the 
same at all times and in all places, and proceeds on other data 
which are equally so, it would not only secure a perpetual uniformity throughout the United States, but might lead to universal standards in these matters among nations. Next to the inconveniency of speaking different languages, is that of using 
different and arbitrary weights and measures. 
I am, dear sir, your affectionate friend.
