MY DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 9th I received late last 
night by a messenger from the neighbourhood of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, who returns early this morning. I have therefore not had 
time to read the papers inclosed in it, and even the letter itself 
but hastily. Its silence as to France is a cordial to the fears we 
have been kept in by the newspapers and reports here, of hearing every moment of her final catastrophe. If the army had 
stood by Dumouriez's treason, as was the uncontradicted idea 
for a time, scarce a possibility seemed to remain of any other 
result. I fell in two days ago with French Strother, who was 
returning circuitously from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>. He had seen W. C. 
Nicholas on his way, and spoke of him as among the decided 
friends of the French cause. In general, I discovered that his 
testimony and conviction corroborated the fact that the people 
of this Country, where you cannot trace the causes of particular 
exceptions, are unanimous and explicit in their sympathy with 
the Revolution. He was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> during the session of the 
Court of the United States, and heard the opinions of the Judges 
on the subject of the British debts. Jay's, he says, was, that the 
depreciated payments into the Treasury discharged the debtor, 
but leaves the State liable to the creditor. It would be a hard 
tax on those who have suffered themselves by the depreciation 
to bear Such a burden. It would be severely felt by those who 
put money into the Treasury on loan, and have received certificates by the scale, and those again further reduced by the modifications of the assumption.
