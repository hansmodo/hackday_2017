DEAR SIR, I have put off, from day to day, writing to my 
friends from this place, in hopes of being able to say something 
of the Convention. Contrary to every previous calculation, the 
bare quorum of seven States was not made up till the day before yesterday. The States composing it are <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina,' and 
South Carolina. Individual members are here from Massachusetts, Maryland, and Georgia, and our intelligence promises a 
complete addition of the first and last, as also of Connecticut, 
by to-morrow. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> was called to the chair 
by a unanimous voice, and has accepted it. The secretary is a 
Major Jackson. This is all that has yet been done, except the 
appointment of a committee for preparing the rules by which 
the Convention is to be governed in their proceedings. A few 
days will now furnish some data for calculating the probable 
result of the meeting. In general, the members seem to accord 
in viewing our situation as peculiarly critical, and on being 
averse to temporizing expedients. I wish they may as readily 
agree when particulars are brought forward. Congress are 
reduced to five or six States, and are not likely to do anything 
during the term of the Convention.

A packet has lately arrived from France, but brings no news. 
</p><p>
I learnt with great pleasure, by the Governor, that you continued to enjoy a comfortable degree of health, and heartily 
wish this may find it still further confirmed; being, with sincere 
affection and the highest esteem, 
</p><p>
Your obed. friend and serv.
