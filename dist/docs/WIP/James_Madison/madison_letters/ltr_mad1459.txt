TO WILLIAM BRADFORD, JR. 
</p><p>
July 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, I am once more got into my native land, and into 
the possession of my customary employments, solitude and contemplation; though I must confess not a little disturbed by the 
sound of war, blood, and plunder, on the one hand, and the 
threats of slavery and oppression on the other. From the best 
accounts I can obtain from our frontiers, the savages are determined on the extirpation of the inhabitants, and no longer leave 
them the alternative of death or captivity. The consternation 
and timidity of the white people, who abandon their possessions 
without making the least resistance, are as difficult to be accounted for as they are encouraging to the enemy. Whether it 
be owing to the unusual cruelty of the Indians, the want of 
necessary implements or ammunition for war, or to the ignorance and inexperience of many who, since the establishment of 
peace, have ventured into those new settlements, I can neither 
learn, nor with any certainty conjecture. However, it is confidently asserv.d that there is not an inhabitant for some hundreds 
of miles back which have been settled for many years except 
those who are [forted ?] in or embodied by their military commanders. The state of things has induced Lord Dunmore, 
contrary to his intentions at the dissolution of the Assembly, to 
issue writs for a new election of members, whom he is to call 
together on the llth of August. 
</p><p>
As to the sentiments of the people of this Colony with respect 
to the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>ians, I can assure you I find them very warm in 
their favor. The natives are very numerous and resolute, are 
making resolves in almost every county, and I believe are willing to fall in with the other Colonies in any expedient measure, 
even if that should be the universal prohibition of trade. It 
must not be denied, though, that the Europeans, especially the 
Scotch, and some interested merchants among the natives, discountenance such proceedings as far as they dare; alledging the 
injustice and perfidy of refusing to pay our debts to our generous creditors at home. This consideration induces some honest, 
moderate folks to prefer a partial prohibition, extending only 
to the importation of goods. 
</p><p>
We have a report here that Governor Gage has sent Lord 
Dunmore somerelating to public matters in which he 
says he has strong hopes that he shall be able to bring things 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> to an amicable settlement. I suppose you know 
whether there be any truth in the report, or any just foundation 
for such an opinion in Gage. 
</p><p>
It has been said here by some, that the appointed fast was 
disregarded by every Scotch clergyman, though it was observ. 
by most of the others who had timely notice of it. I cannot 
avouch it for an absolute certainty, but it appears no ways 
incredible. 
</p><p>
I was so lucky as to find Dean Tucker's tracts on my return 
home, sent by mistake with some other books imported this 
spring. I have read them with peculiar satisfaction and illumination with respect to the interests of America and Britain. 
At the same time his ingenious and plausible defence of parliamentary authority carries in it such defects and misrepresentations, as confirm me in political orthodoxy after the same 
manner as the specious arguments of Infidels have established 
the faith of inquiring Christians. 
</p><p>
I am impatient to hear from you; and do now certainly [earnestly?] renew the stipulation for that friendly correspondence 
which alone can comfort me in the privation of your company. 
I shall be punctual in transmitting you an account of everything that can be acceptable, but must freely absolve you from 
as strict an obligation, which your application to more important business will not allow, and which my regard for your ease 
and interests will not suffer me to enjoin. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your faithful friend.
