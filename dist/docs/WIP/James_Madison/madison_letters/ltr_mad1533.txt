DEAR SIR, The past week has been rendered important by 
nothing but some discussions on the subject of British debts. 
The bill brought in varied from that which miscarried last 
year : 1 . By adding provision in favor of the creditors for securing payment at the dates of the instalments. 2. By annexing 
a clause empowering the Executive to suspend the operation of 
the act in case Congress should notify their wish to that effect. 
Great difficulty was found in drawing the House into Committee on the subject. It was at length effected on Wednesday. 
The changes made in the Bill by the Committee are: 1. Striking out the clause saving the Creditors from the act of limitation, which makes the whole a scene of mockery. 2. Striking 
out the provision for securities. 3. Converting the clause authorizing Congress to direct a suspension of the act into a 
clause suspending it until Congress should notify to the Executive that Great Britain had complied with the Treaty on her 
part, or that, they were satisfied with the steps taken by her for 
evacuating tlie posts, paying for Negroes, and for a full compliance with the Treaty. The sentence underlined was proposed 
as an amendment to the amendment, and admitted by a very 
small majority only. 4. Exonerating the public from responsibility for the payments into the Treasury by British debtors 
beyond the real value of the liquidated paper. Since these proceedings of the Committee of the whole the subject has slept 
on the table, no one having called for the report. Being convinced myself that nothing can be now done that will not extremely dishonor us and embarrass Congress, my wish is that 
the report may not be called for at all.

In the course of the debates no pains were spared to disparage the Treaty by insinuations against Congress, the Eastern 
States, and the negociators of the Treaty, particularly J. Adams. 
These insinuations and artifices explain, perhaps, one of the 
motives from which the augmentation of the federal powers and 
respectability has been opposed. 
The reform of the County Courts has dwindled into directions for going through the docket quarterly, under the same 
penalties as now oblige them to do their business monthly. The 
experiment has demonstrated the impracticability of rendering 
these courts fit instruments of Justice; and if it had preceded 
the Assize Question, would, I think, have ensured its success. 
Some wish to renew this question in a varied form, or at least 
under a varied title, but the session is too near its period for 
such an attempt. When it will end I know not. The business 
depending would employ the House till March. A system of 
navigation and commercial regulations for this State alone is 
before us, and comprises matter for a month's debate. The 
compact with Maryland has been ratified. It was proposed to 
submit it to Congress for their sanction, as being within the 
word Treaty used in the Confederation. This was opposed. It 
was then attempted to transmit it to our Delegates, to be by 
them simply laid before Congress. Even this was negatived by 
a large majority.
