DEAR SIR, On our arrival here we found that the number 
of Representatives on the spot had been stationary from the 
second day of the meeting. Mr. Page, Mr. Lee, and myself, 
raised it to 21, and Mr. S. Griffin and Mr. Moore have been 
since added. The number of attending Senators continues at 
eight. When a quorum will be made up in either House rests 
on vague conjecture rather than on any precise information. It 
is not improbable, I think, that the present week will supply 
the deficiency in one, if not in both of them. The States most 
convenient are among the defaulters. It will not be known, I 
am told, in this State, who the Representatives are, till some 
time next month. The federal party calculate on an equal 
division of the six. Mr. Lawrence for the city district, Mr. 
Floyd for the Long Island district, and Mr. Benson for a third. 
In New Jersey the election has been conducted in a very singular manner. The law having fixed no time expressly for closing 
the polls, they have been kept open three or four weeks in some 
of the counties, by a rival jealousy between the Eastern and 
western divisions of the State; and it seems uncertain when 
they would have been closed if the governor had not interposed, 
by fixing on a day for receiving the returns, and proclaiming 
the successful candidates. The day is passed, but I have not 
heard the result. The Western ticket in favor of Skureman, 
Boudinot, Cadwallader, and Sennickson, if this be the name, is 
supposed to have prevailed; but an impeachment of the election 
by the unsuccessful competitors has been talked of. Two of the 
Representatives from Massachusetts are also unknown to us. 
In one of the districts it is supposed that a disaffected man has 
prevailed.

An English packet has been long expected, and is not yet 
arrived. The state of foreign news remains, of consequence, 
little altered. The accounts of latest date, through other 
channels, shew that the progress in France towards a constitutional establishment is unchecked, and that a coalition between 
the king and the commons against the nobility and clergy will 
direct the innovations. 
</p><p>
With respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington and the 
rest of the family, I am, dear sir, truly and affect'y. your obt 
serv.
