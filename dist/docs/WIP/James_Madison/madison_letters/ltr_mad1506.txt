HON'D SlR, Having a moment's time to drop you a line, I inform you that the Bill for confirming surveys against subsequent 
entries has been negatived by a large majority, rather on the 
principle that it was unnecessary and retrospective than that 
it was unjust in itself. On the contrary, all the principal gentlemen were of opinion that it was just, but already provided for 
by the law. Mr. Innes, the late Judge of the Kentucky Court, 
in particular, told me he thought such surveys could not be 
overset. You will have heard of the vote in favor of the General Assessment. The bill is not yet brought in, and I question 
whether it will; or if so, whether it will pass. This day a vote 
passed without a dissent for Circuit Courts. What opposition 
may be made to its passage I know not.
