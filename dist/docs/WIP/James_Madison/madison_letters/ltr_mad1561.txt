DEAR SIR, Some little time before my arrival here, a quorum 
of the States was made up, and General St. Clair put in the 
Chair. We have at present nine States on the ground, but shall 
lose South Carolina to-day. Other States are daily expected. 
What business of moment may be done by the present or a fuller 
meeting is uncertain. 
</p><p>
The objects now depending and most immediately in prospect 
are: 1. The Treaty of Peace. The Secretary of foreign Affairs 
has very ably reported a view of the infractions on both sides, 
his exposition of the contested articles, and the steps proper to 
be taken by Congress. I find, what I was not before apprized 
of, that more than one infraction on our part preceded even the 
violation on the other side in the instance of the negroes. Some 
of the reasoning on the subject of the debts would be rather 
grating to Virginia. A full compliance with the Treaty according to judicial constructions, and as a ground for insisting on a 
reciprocal compliance, is the proposition in which the Report 
terminates. 2. A recommendation of the proposed Convention 
in May. Congress have been much divided and embarrassed 
on the question whether their taking an interest in the measure 
would impede or promote it. On one side it has been urged 
that some of the backward States have scruples against acceding to it without some constitutional sanction; on the other, 
that other States will consider any interference of Congress as 
proceeding from the same views which have hitherto excited 
their jealousies. A vote of the Legislature here, entered into 
yesterday, will give some relief in the case. They have instructed their delegates in Congress to move for the reconsideration in question. The vote was carried by a majority of one 
only in the Senate, and there is room to suspect that the minority were actuated by a dislike to the substance, rather than by 
any objection against the form of the business. A large majority 
in the other Branch a few days ago put a definitive veto on the 
Impost. 
</p><p>
It would seem as if the politics of this State are directed by 
individual interests and plans, which might be incommoded by 
the controul of an efficient federal Government. The four States 
north of it are still to make their decision on the subject of the 
Convention. I am told by one of the Massachusetts delegates 
that the Legislature of that State, which is now sitting, will 
certainly accede and appoint Deputies if Congress declare their 
approbation of the measure. I have similar information that 
Connecticut will probably come in, though it is said that the 
interference of Congress will rather have a contrary tendency 
there. It is expected that South Carolina will not fail to adopt 
the plan, and that Georgia is equally well disposed. All the 
intermediate States between the former and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> have 
already appointed Deputies, except Maryland, which, it is said, 
means to do it, and has entered into some vote which declares 
as much. Nothing has yet been done by the new Congress with 
regard to the Mississippi. 
</p><p>
Our latest information from Massachusetts gives hopes that 
the meeting, or, as the Legislature there now style it, the Rebellion, is nearly extinct. If the measures, however, on foot for 
disarming and disfranchising those concerned in it should be 
carried into effect, a new crisis may be brought on. 
</p><p>
I have not been here long enough to gather the general sentiments of leading characters touching our affairs and prospects. 
I am inclined to hope that they will gradually be concentered 
in the plan of a thorough reform of the existing system. Those 
who may lean towards a monarchical government, and who, I 
suspect, are swayed by very indigested ideas, will of course 
abandon an unattainable object whenever a prospect opens of 
rendering the Republican form competent to its purposes. Those 
who remain attached to the latter form must soon perceive that 
it cannot be preserv. at all under any modification which does 
not redress the ills experienced from our present establishments. Virginia is the only State which has made any provision for the late moderate but essential requisition of Congress, 
and her provision is a partial one only. 
</p><p>
This would have been of earlier date, but I have waited for 
more interesting subjects for it. I shall do myself the pleasure 
of repeating the liberty of dropping you a few lines as often as 
proper occasions arise, on no other condition, however, than 
your waiving the trouble of regular answers or acknowledgements on your part. 
</p><p>
With the greatest respect and affection, I am, D'r Sir, your 
obt friend and serv.
