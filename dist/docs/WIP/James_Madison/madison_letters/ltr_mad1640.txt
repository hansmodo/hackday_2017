DEAR SIR, The inclosed copy of Morgan's invitation to his 
fellow-citizens was obtained from one of his friends, and forwarded to me from Pennsylvania. It is the most authentic and 
precise evidence of the Spanish project that has come to my 
knowledge. The instrument referred to as retained in Morgan's 
hands, in order to be signed by the adventurers, would still further explain the transaction. 
</p><p>
No Quorum is yet formed in either house. The Senate want 
two members; the House of Rep 8 four. It is probable that 
the members from N. Jersey, who are at length proclaimed, two 
remaining members from Penn, and Col. Coles, who halted in 
Philad, will come in this evening, and supply the deficiency in 
one Branch. The Senate have no precise prospect of the small 
addition required to their numbers. 
</p><p>
With unfeigned attachment, <fcc., &c. 
</p><p>
[Put into the hands of confidential people in Pennsylv" and N. 
Jersey, for the purpose of procuring followers.] 
</p><p>
Several gentlemen who propose to make settlements in the 
Western Country mean to reconnoitre and survey the same 
the ensuing winter. All farmers, Tradesmen, &c., of good characters, who wish to unite in the scheme and to visit the Country under my direction, shall be provided with boats and provisions for the purpose, free of expense, on signing an agreement, which may be seen by applying to me at Prospect, near 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">PRINCETON</a>, on or before the 8th day of October next, or at Fort 
Pitt by the 10th day of November next. The boats which will 
be employed on this expedition are proposed to be from 40 to 
60 feet long, to row with 20 oars each, and to carry a number 
of swivels. Each man to provide himself with a good fire-lock 
or rifle, ammunition, and one blanket, or more if he pleases. 
Such as choose tents or other conveniences must provide them 
themselves. Every person who accompanies me on this undertaking shall be entitled to 320 acres of land, at | of a dollar 
per acre. Those who first engage to have the preference of 
surveys, which, however, each person may make on such part 
of the whole tract as he pleases, taking none but his choice of 
the best lands, providedt such survey is either square or oblong, 
whose sides are East, West, North, and South; 640 acres or more 
being first reserv. for a Town, which I propose to divide into 
lots of one acre each, and give 600 of them in fee to such Merchants, tradesmen, &c., as may apply on the spot, and 40 of 
them to such public uses as the inhabitants shall from time to 
time recommend, together with one out-lot of ten acres to each 
of the first 600 families who shall settle in the Town. All persons who settle with me at New Madrid, and their posterity, 
will have the free navigation of the Mississippi, and a market 
at New Orleans, free from duties, for all the produce of their 
lands, where they may receive payment in Mexican Dollars for 
their flour, Tobacco, &c. 
</p><p>
It is proposed, after fifing on the spot, to clear and fence in 
one hundred acres in a convenient situation, to plant it with 
corn, to hire suitable hands to tend it thro 7 the summer, and in 
the next fall, winter, and spring, to distribute it tot new settlers 
at of a dollar per bushel, that they may have a dependence 
so far as this will go. And as buffaloes and other game are 
very plenty in the neighborhood there can be no want of provision, contractors being ready to engage to deliver fresh beef 
and venison throughout the year at 1 penny per pound. Credit 
will be given to those who desire it, as well for the land as| for 
the provisions, and payment received in future produce. All 
persons will be assisted in building a House, clearing a spot of 
ground, and in getting in their first crops. Horned cattle, 
horses, and swine, will be delivered to the settlers at New 
Madrid in such quantities as they shall stand in need of at first, 
at very reasonable rates for cash|| or future produce. Those who 
settle at New Madrid in this or the ensuing year shall have 
plough-irons, or other Iron works, and farming utensils, transported down the Ohio gratis; also their clothing, bedding, 
kitchen furniture, and certain other articles which may not be 
too bulky. 
</p><p>
Schoolmasters will be engaged immediately for the instruction of youth. Ministers of the Gospel will meet with encouragement, 
and grants of land made in fee to each of every denomination who may agree with a congregation before the year 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1790">1790</a>, besides particular grants of tracts of land to each Society. 
</p><p>
This new city is proposed to be built on a high bank of the 
Mississippi River, near the mouth of the Ohio, in the richest 
and most healthy part of the Western Country, about the latitude of 37. 
</p><p>
Those who wish for further information will be pleased to 
apply to me in person as above mentioned, or at the new City 
of Madrid after the first day of next Dec'r , where the Surveyors 
will attend to lay out the lands. 
(Signed.)
