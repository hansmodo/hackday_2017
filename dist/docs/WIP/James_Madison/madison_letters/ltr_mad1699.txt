MY DEAR SIR, I have received your favor of the 8th, and 
handed to Freneau the subscriptions inclosed for him. His 
paper, in the opinion here, justifies the expectations of his 
friends, and merits the diffusive circulation they have endeavoured to procure it. 
</p><p>
I regret that I can administer no balm to the wound given 
by the first report of our Western disaster. You will have seen 
the official account which has gone into all the Newspapers. It 
does not seem to contain any of the saving circumstances you 
are so anxious to learn. The loss of blood is not diminished, 
and that of impression is as great as the most compleat triumph 
of the savages can render it. The measures planning for the 
reparation of the calamity are not yet disclosed. The suspected 
relation of Indian hostility to the Western posts became here, 
as with you, a subject of pretty free conversation. 
</p>
