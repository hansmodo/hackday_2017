MY DEAR FRIEND, My last stated a question relating to the 
power of removal from offices then on the anvil of the House 
of Representatives. I now inclose the discussions, as conveyed 
to the public thro' the newspapers. It is not necessary to apprize you that the reasonings on both sides are mutilated, often 
misapprehended, and not unfrequently reversed. You will perceive yourself that much of the reasoning is also founded on a 
misconception of the ideas of the adverse side.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> has at length obtained formal leave to visit 
his own country. Mr. Short is to be charged with the affairs 
of the United States in his absence. 
</p><p>
.The President has been ill, but is now in a safe way. His 
fever terminated in an abscess, which was itself alarming, but 
has been opened with success, and the alarm is now over. His 
death, at the present moment, would have brought on another 
crisis in our affairs. 
</p><p>
Yrs most truly.
