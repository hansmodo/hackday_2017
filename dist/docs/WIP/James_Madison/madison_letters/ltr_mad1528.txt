</p><p>
DEAR SIR, In pursuance of the plan intimated in my last, I 
came to this city about three weeks ago, from which I continued my trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. I returned last night, and in a day 
or two shall start for Virginia. Col. Monroe had left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> a few days before I reached it, on his way to a treaty 
to be held with the Indians about the end of this month on the 
Wabash. If a visit to the Eastern States had been his choice, 
short as the time would have proved, I should have made an 
effort to attend him. As it is, I must postpone that gratification, with a purpose, however, of embracing it on the first convenient opportunity. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 11 May, by Mons r Doradour, inclosing 
your cypher, arrived in Virginia after I left it, and was sent 
after me to this place. Your notes which accompanied it remained behind, and consequently I can only now say on that 
subject that I shall obey your request on my return, which rny 
call to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> will give me an early opportunity of doing. 
</p><p>
During my stay at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> I had several conversations 
with the Virginia Delegates, but with few others, on the affairs 
of the confederacy. I find with much regret that these are, as 
yet, little redeemed from the confusion which has so long mortified the friends to our national honor and prosperity. Congress have kept the vessel from sinking, but it has been by 
standing constantly at the pump, not by stopping the leaks 
which have endangered her. All their efforts for the latter 
purpose have been frustrated by the selfishness or perverseness 
of some part or other of their constituents. The desiderata 
most strongly urged by our past experience and our present 
situation are: 1. A final discrimination between such of the 
unauthorised expences of the States as ought to be added to the 
common debt, and such as ought not. 2. A constitutional apportionment of the common debt, either by a valuation of the 
lands, or a change of the article which requires it. 3. A recognition by the States of the authority of Congress to enforce 
payment of their respective quotas. 4. A grant to Congress 
of an adequate power over trade. 
</p><p>
It is evident to me that the first object will never be effected 
in Congress, because it requires in those who are to decide it 
the spirit of impartial judges, whilst the spirit of those who 
compose Congress is rather that of advocates for the respective 
interests of their constituents. If this business were referred 
to a commission filled by a member chosen by Congress out of 
each State, and sworn to impartiality, I should have hopes of 
seeing an end of it. The 2 d object affords less ground of hope. 
The execution of the 8 th article of Confederation is generally 
held impracticable, and Rhode Island, if no other State, has put 
its veto on the proposed alteration of it. Until the 3 d ' object 
can be obtained, the Requisitions of Congress will continue to 
be mere calls for voluntary contributions, which every State 
will be tempted to evade, by the uniform experience that those 
States have come off best which have done so most. The present plan of federal Government reverses the first principle of 
all Government. It punishes not the evil-doers, but those that 
do well. It may be considered, I think, as a fortunate circumstance for the United States, that the use of coercion, or such 
provision as would render the use of it unnecessary, might be 
made at little expence and perfect safety. A single frigate 
under the orders of Congress could make it the interest of any 
one of the Atlantic States to pay its just quota. With regard 
to such of the ultramontane States as depend on the trade of 
the Mississippi, as small a force would have the same effect; 
whilst the residue trading through the Atlantic States might be 
wrought upon by means more indirect, indeed, but perhaps sufficiently effectual. 
</p><p>
The fate of the 4 th object is still suspended. The Recommendations of Congress on this subject, past before your departure, have been positively complied with by few of the States, I 
believe; but I do not learn that they have been rejected by any. 
A proposition has been agitated in Congress, and will, I am 
told, be revived, asking from the States a general and permanent authority to regulate trade, with a proviso that it shall in 
no case be exercised without the assent of eleven States in Congress. The Middle States favor the measure; the Eastern are 
zealous for it; the Southern are divided. Of the Virginia delegation, the president* is an inflexible adversary, Grayson unfriendly, and Monroe and Hardy warm on the opposite side. 
If the proposition should pass Congress, its fate will depend 
much on the reception it may find in Virginia, and this will depend much on the part which may be taken by a few members 
of the Legislature. The prospect of its being levelled against 
Great Britain will be most likely to give it popularity. 
</p><p>
In this suspence of a general provision for our commercial 
interests, the more suffering States are seeking relief from partial efforts, which are less likely to obtain it than to drive their 
trade into other channels, and to kindle heart-burnings on all 
sides. Massachusetts made the beginning; Pennsylvania has 
followed with a catalogue of duties on foreign goods and tonnage, which could scarcely be enforced against the smuggler, if 
New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, were to co-operate with 
her. The avowed object of these duties is to encourage domestic manufactures, and prevent the exportation of coin to pay 
for foreign. The Legislature had previously repealed the incorporation of the Bank, as the cause of the latter and a great 
many other evils. South Carolina, I am told, is deliberating 
on the distresses of her commerce, and will probably concur in 
some general plan, with a proviso, no doubt, against any restraint from importing slaves, of which they have received from 
Africa since the peace about twelve Thousand. She is also deliberating on the emission of paper money, and it is expected 
she will legalize a supension of Judicial proceedings, which has 
been already effected by popular combinations. The pretext 
for these measures is the want of specie occasioned by the unfavorable balance of trade. 
</p><p>
Your introduction of Mr. T. Franklin has been presented to 
me. The arrival of his Grandfather has produced an emulation 
among the different parties here in doing homage to his character. He will be unanimously chosen president of the State, 
and will either restore to it an unexpected quiet or lose his 
own. It appears, from his answer to some applications, that he 
will not decline the appointment. 
</p><p>
On my journey I called at Mount Vernon, and had the pleasure of finding the General in perfect health. He had just returned from a trip up the Potomac. He grows more and more 
sanguine as he examines further into the practicability of opening its navigation. The subscriptions are completed within a 
few shares, and the work is already begun at some of the lesserv.
obstructions. It is overlooked by Rumsey, the inventor of the 
boats, which I have in formermentioned to you. He 
has not yet disclosed his secret. He had of late nearly finished 
a boat of proper size, which he meant to have exhibited, but the 
House which contained it and materials for others was consumed by fire. He assured the General that the enlargement 
of his machinery did not lessen the prospect of utility afforded 
by the miniature experiments. The General declines the shares 
voted him by the Assembly, but does not mean to withdraw the 
money from the object which it is to aid, and will even appropriate the future tolls, I believe, to some useful public establishment, if any such can be devised that will both please himself and be likely to please the State. 
</p><p>
This is accompanied by a letter from our amiable friend, Mrs. 
Trist, to Miss Patsy. She got back safe to her friends in August, and is as well as she has generally been; but her cheerfulness seems to be rendered less uniform than it once was by the 
scenes of adversity through which fortune has led her. Mrs. 
House is well, and charges me not to omit her respectful and 
affectionate compliments to you. 
</p><p>
I remain, dear sir, yours.

* E. H. Lee.
