</p><p>
DEAR SIR, On my arrival here I found that Mr. Short had 
passed through on his way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and was there at the 
date of my last. I regret much that I missed the pleasure of 
seeing him. The inclosed was put into my hands by Mrs. House, 
who received it after he left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. My two last, neither 
of which were in cypher, were written, as will be all future 
ones in the same situation, in expectation of their being read 
by postmasters. I am well assured that this is the fate of all 
, at least to and from public persons, not only in France 
but all the other Countries of Europe. Having now the use of 
my cypher, I can write without restraint. 
</p><p>
In my last I gave you a sketch of what passed at Fort Schuyler during my stay there; mentioning in particular that the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="friend colleague met">Marquis</a> had made a speech to the Indians, with the sanction 
of the Commissioners, Wolcot, Lee, and Butler. The question 
will probably occur how a foreigner, and a private one, could 
appear on the theatre of a public Treaty between the United 
States and the Indian nations, and how the Commissioners 
could lend a sanction to it. Instead of offering an opinion of 
the measure, I will state the manner in which it was brought 
about. It seems that most of the Indian tribes, particularly 
those of the Iroquois, retain a strong predilection for the French, 
and most of the latter an enthusiastic idea of the Marquis. 
This idea has resulted from his being a Frenchman, the figure 
he has made during the war, and the arrival of several important events which he foretold to them soon after he came to this 
country. Before he went to Fort Schuyler, it had been suggested, either in compliment or sincerity, that his presence and 
influence might be of material serv.e to the treaty. At Albany, 
the same thing had been said to him by General Wolcot. On 
his arrival at Fort Schuyler, Mr. Kirkland recommended an 
exertion of his influence as of essential consequence to the treaty, 
painting in the strongest colours the attachment of the Indians 
to his person, which seemed indeed to be verified by their 
caresses, and the artifices employed by the British partizans to 
frustrate the objects of the treaty, among which was a pretext 
that the alliance between the United States and France was 
insincere and transitory, and, consequently, the respect of the 
Indians for the latter ought to be no motive for their respecting 
the former. Upon these circumstances, the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="friend colleague met">Marquis</a> grounded a 
written message to the Commissioners before they got up, intimating his disposition to render the United States any serv.e 
his small influence over the Indians might put in his power, and 
desiring to know what the Commissioners would chuse him to 
say. The answer, in Mr. Lee's hand, consisted of polite acknowledgments, and information that the Commissioners would 
be happy in affording him an opportunity of saying whatever 
he might wish, forbearing to advise or suggest what it would 
be best for him to say. The Marquis perceived the caution, 
but imputed it to Lee alone. 
</p><p>
As his stay was to be very short, it was necessary for him to 
take provisional measures before the arrival of the Commissioners, and particularly for calling in the Oneida Chiefs, who 
were at their town. It fell to my lot to be consulted in his 
dilemma. My advice was, that he should invite the Chiefs in 
such a way as would give him an opportunity of addressing 
them publicly, if on a personal interview with the Commissioners it should be judged expedient, or of satisfying their expectations with a friendly entertainment in return for the civilities 
his visit to their town had met with. This advice was approved; but the Indians brought with them such ideas of his 
importance as no private reception would probably have been 
equal to. When the Commissioners arrived, the Marquis consulted them in person. They were reserv.; he was embarpassed. Finally, they changed their plan, and concurred explicitly in his making a Speech in form. He accordingly prepared 
one, communicated it to the Commissioners, and publickly pronounced it, the Commissioners premising such an one as was 
thought proper to introduce his. The answer of the Sachems, 
as well as the circumstances of the audience, denoted the highest reverence for the orator. The Chief of the Oneidas said 
that the word which he had spoken to them early in the war 
had prevented them from being misled to the wrong side of it. 
</p><p>
During this scene, and even during the whole stay of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="friend colleague met">Marquis</a>, he was the only conspicuous figure. The Commissioners 
were eclipsed. All of them probably felt it. Lee complained 
to me of the immoderate stress laid on the influence of the Marquis, and evidently promoted his departure. The Marquis was 
not insensible of it, but consoled himself with the serv.e which 
he thought the Indian Speech would witness that he had rendered to the United States. I am persuaded that the transaction is also pleasing to him in another view, as it will form a 
bright column in the Gazettes of Europe. As it is blended 
with the proceedings of the Commissioners, it will probably not 
be published in America very soon. 
</p><p>
The time I have lately passed with the Marquis has given me 
a pretty thorough insight into his character. With great natural frankness of temper, he unites much address and very considerable talents. In his politics, he says his three hobby-horses 
are the alliance between France and the United States, the 
union of the latter, and the manumission of the Slaves. The 
two former are the dearer to him, as they are connected with 
his personal glory. The last does him real honor, as it is a 
proof of his humanity. In a word, I take him to be as amiable 
a man as can be imagined, and as sincere an American as any 
Frenchman can be; one whose past serv.es gratitude obliges 
us to acknowledge, and whose future friendship prudence requires us to cultivate. 
</p><p>
The Committee of the States have never reassembled. The 
case of Longchamps has been left both by the Legislative and 
Executive of this State to its Judiciary course. He is sentenced 
to a fine of 100 crowns, to two years' imprisonment, and security 
for good behaviour for seven years. On tuesday morning I set 
off for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, where I ought to be to-morrow, but some delays have put it out of my power. 
</p><p>
The ramble I have taken has rather inflamed than extinguished my curiosity to see the Northern and N. W. Country. 
If circumstances be favorable, I may probably resume it next 
summer. Present my compliments to Miss Patsy, for whom, as 
well as yourself, Mrs. House charges me with hers. She has 
lately had a letter from poor Mrs. Trist, every syllable of which 
is the language of affection itself. She had arrived safe at the 
habitation of her deceased Husband, but will not be able to 
leave that country till the spring, at the nearest. The only 
happiness she says she is capable of, is to receive proofs that her 
friends have not forgotten her. I do not learn what is likely 
to be the amount of the effects left by Mr. T.; former accounts 
varied from 6 to 10,000 dollars. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Sir, yours very affect 6 ' 7 .
