I have hitherto not been inattentive to the request of Mrs. 
J., and shall, in consequence of your letter, renew my efforts 
for the books, which the return of peace renders more likely to 
be attainable for her. I see few books in the catalogue which 
you have sent which are worth purchasing, but I will peruse it 
more carefully, and send you the titles of such as I may select.

I received a letter from Mr. Joseph Chew a few days ago, by 
which, and the information of Colonel Wadsworth, who brought 
it and is a friend of his, I find that he is in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> with his 
family; that they are all well; that he continues as yet to hold 
a post which supports them comfortably; that although he has 
enjoyed opportunities of honestly laying up profits, his generosity of temper has prevented it. I cannot learn whether he 
proposes to remain in this country or not, but am inclined to 
think he will go to Canada, where he has some little expectations. He seems to be exceedingly anxious to hear of his 
friends in Virginia, and I have written as fully to him on the 
subject as my knowledge would admit. I wish some of his 
friends on the spot, and particularly yourself, would write to 
him. Besides the information he would receive, it would be a 
pleasing proof to him that he still retained a place in their 
remembrance and regards.

We are without information of late as to the progress of the 
definitive treaty, and of the bill in the British Parliament for 
opening trade with the United States. The confusions produced in their counsels by the long suspension of the Ministry 
seem to put everything to a stand. The paper which I enclose 
will give you the latest information on that subject. 
Y r dutiful son.
