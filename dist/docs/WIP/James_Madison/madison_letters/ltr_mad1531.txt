DEAR SIR, Supposing that you will be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> by the 
time this reaches it, I drop a few lines for the post of to-day. 
Mr. Jones tells me he informed you that a substitute had been 
brought forward to the commercial propositions which you left 
on the carpet. The subject has not since been called up. If 
any change has taken place in the mind of the House, it has not 
been unfavorable to the idea of confiding to Congress a power 
over trade. I am far from thinking, however, that a perpetual 
power can be made palatable at this time. It is more probable 
that the other idea of a Convention of Commissioners to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>, from the States, for deliberating on the state of commerce and the degree of power which ought to be lodged in 
Congress, will be attempted. Should it fail in the House, it is 
possible that a revival of the printed propositions, with an extension of their term to twenty-five years, will be thought on 
by those who contend that something of a general nature ought 
to be done. My own opinion is unaltered. The propositions 
for a State effort have passed, and a bill is ordered in, but the 
passage of the bill will be a work of difficulty and uncertainty; 
many having acquiesced in the preliminary stages who will 
strenuously oppose the measure in its last stages. 
</p><p>
No decisive vote has been yet taken on the assize bill. I 
conceive it to be in some danger, but that the chance is in its 
favour. The case of the British debts will be introduced in a 
day or two. We have got through more than half of the Revisal. The criminal bill has been assailed on all sides. Mr. 
Mercer has proclaimed unceasing hostility against it. Some 
alterations have been made, and others probably will be made, 
but I think the main principle of it will finally triumph over all 
opposition. I had hoped that this session would have finished 
the code, but a vote against postponing the further consideration of it till the next was carried by so small a majority, that 
I perceive it will be necessary to contend for nothing more 
than a few of the more important bills, leaving the residue of 
them for another year. 
</p><p>
My proposed amendment to the report on the Memorial of 
Kentucky was agreed to in a Committee of the whole without 
alteration, and with very few dissents. It lies on the table for 
the ratification of the House. The members from that district 
have become extremely cold on the subject of an immediate separation. The half tax is postponed till March, and the September tax till November next. Not a word has passed in the 
House as to a paper emission. I wish to hear from you on your 
arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and to receive, in particular, whatever 
you may be at liberty to disclose with regard to the Treaty of 
peace, &c., with Great Britain.

</p><p>
DEAE SIE, Your favor of November 30 was received a few 
days ago. This would have followed much earlier the one 
which yours acknowledges, had I not wished it to contain some 
final information relative to the commercial propositions. The . 
discussion of them has consumed much time, and though the 
absolute necessity of some such general system prevailed over 
all the efforts of its adversaries in the first instance, the stratagem of limiting its duration to a short term has ultimately disappointed our hopes. I think it better to trust to further experience, and even distress, for an adequate remedy, than to try 
a temporary measure, which may stand in the way of a permanent one, and confirm that transatlantic policy which is founded 
on our supposed distrust of Congress and of one another. 
</p><p>
Those whose opposition in this case did not spring from illiberal animosities towards the Northern States seem to have been 
frightened, on one side, at the idea of a perpetual and irrevocable 
grant of power, and, on the other, flattered with a hope that a 
temporary grant might be renewed from time to time, if its 
utility should be confirmed by the experiment. But we have 
already granted perpetual and irrevocable powers of a more 
extensive nature than those now proposed, and for reasons not 
stronger than the reasons which urge the latter. And as to the 
hope of renewal, it is the most visionary one that perhaps ever 
deluded men of sense. 
</p><p>
Nothing but the peculiarity of our circumstances could ever 
have produced those sacrifices of sovereignty on which the federal Government now rests. If they had been temporary, and 
the expiration of the term required a renewal at this crisis, 
pressing as the crisis is, and recent as is our experience of the 
value of the Confederacy, sure I am that it would be impossible 
to revive it. What room have we, then, to hope that the expiration of temporary grants of commercial powers would always 
find a unanimous disposition in the States to follow their own 
example ? 
It ought to be remembered, too, that besides the caprice, jealousy, and diversity of opinions, which will be certain obstacles 
in our way, the policy of foreign nations may hereafter imitate 
that of the Macedonian Prince who effected his purposes against 
the Grecian Confederacy by gaining over a few of the leading 
men in the smaller members of it. Add to the whole, that the 
difficulty now found in obtaining a unanimous concurrence of 
the States in any measure whatever must continually increase 
with every increase of their numbers, and, perhaps, in a greater 
ratio, as the ultramontane States may either have, or suppose 
they have, a less similitude of interests to the Atlantic States 
than these have to one another. 
</p><p>
The propositions, however, have not yet received the final 
vote of the House, having lain on the table for some time as a 
report from the committee of the whole. The question was suspended in order to consider a proposition which had for its 
object a meeting of Politico-commercial Commissioners from 
all the States, for the purpose of digesting and reporting the 
requisite augmentation of the power of Congress over trade. 
</p><p>
What the event will be cannot be foreseen. The friends of 
the original propositions are, I am told, rather increasing; but 
I despair of a majority, in any event, for a longer term than 
25 years for their duration. The other scheme will have fewer 
enemies, and may, perhaps, be carried. It seems naturally to 
grow out of the proposed appointment of Commissioners for 
Virginia and Maryland, concerted at Mount Vernon, for keeping up harmony in the commercial regulations of the two States. 
Maryland has ratified the Report; but has invited into the plan 
Delaware and Pennsylvania, who will naturally pay the same 
compliment to their neighbours, &c. 
</p><p>
Besides the general propositions on the subject of trade, it 
has been proposed that some intermediate measures should be 
taken by ourselves; and a sort of navigation act will, I am apprehensive, be attempted. It is backed by the mercantile interest of most of our towns, except <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a>, which alone seems 
to have liberality and light on the subject. It was refused even 
to suspend the measure on the concurrence of Maryland or N. 
Carolina. This folly, however, cannot, one would think, brave 
the ruin which it threatens to our Merchants, as well as people 
at large, when a final vote comes to be given. 
</p><p>
We have got through a great part of the Revisal, and might 
by this time have been at the end of it, had the time wasted in 
disputing whether it could be finished at this session been spent 
in forwarding the work. As it is, we must content ourselves 
with passing a few more of the important Bills, leaving the 
residue for our successors of the next year. As none of the 
Bills passed are to be in force till January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>, and the residue unpassed will probably be least disputable in their nature, 
this expedient, tho' little eligible, is not inadmissible. 
</p><p>
Our public credit has had a severe attack and a narrow 
escape. As a compromise, it has been necessary to set forward 
the half tax till March, and the whole tax of September next 
till November ensuing. The latter postponement was meant to 
give the planters more time to deal with the Merchants in the 
sale of their Tobacco, and is made a permanent regulation. 
The Assize Bill is now depending. It has many enemies, and 
its fate is precarious. My hopes, however, prevail over my apprehensions. The fate of the Port Bill is more precarious. 
The failure of an interview between our Commissioners and 
Commissioners on the part of North Carolina has embarrassed 
the projected Canal between the waters of the two States. If 
North Carolina were entirely well disposed, the passing an act 
suspended on and referred to her Legislature would be sufficient; 
and this course must, I suppose, be tried, tho' previous negociation would have promised more certain success. 
</p><p>
Kentucky has made a formal application for Independence. 
Her memorial has been considered and the terms of separation 
fixed by a committee of the whole. The substance of them is, 
that all private rights and interests derived from the laws of 
Virginia shall be secured; that the unlocated lands shall be applied to the objects to which the laws of Virginia have appropriated them; that non-residents shall be subjected to no higher 
taxes than residents; that the Ohio shall be a common highway for Citizens of the United States, and the jurisdiction of 
Kentucky and Virginia, as far as the remaining territory of 
the latter will lie thereon, be concurrent only with the new 
States on the opposite shore; that the proposed State shall take 
its due share of our State debts; and that the separation shall 
not take place unless these terms shall be approved by a Convention to be held to decide the question, nor until Congress 
shall assent thereto, and fix the terms of their admission into 
the Union. The limits of the proposed State are to be the same 
with the present limits of the District. The apparent coolness 
of the Representatives of Kentucky as to a separation since 
these terms have been defined indicates that they had some 
views which will not be favored by them. They disliked much 
to be hung up on the will of Congress.
