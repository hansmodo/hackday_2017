DEAR SIR, I have seen Col. Smith more than once. He 
would have opened his budget fully to me, but I declined giving 
him the trouble. He has written to the President a statement 
of all his conversations with the British Ministry, which will 
get into your hands of course. He mentioned to me his wish 
to have put them there in the first instance, and your situation 
on his arrival as an apology for not doing it. From the complexion of the little anecdotes and observ.ions which dropped 
from him in our interviews, I suspect that report has, as usual, 
far overrated the importance of what has been confided to him. 
General professions, which mean nothing, and the sending a 
Minister, which can be suspended at pleasure, or which, if executed, may produce nothing, are the amount of my present 
guesses.

Mr. Adams seems to be getting faster and faster into difficulties. His attack on Paine, which I have not seen, will draw 
the public attention to his obnoxious principles more than everything he has published. Besides this, I observ.in M c Lean's 
paper here a long extract from a sensible letter republished 
from Poughkeepsie, which gives a very unpopular form to his 
anti-republican doctrines, and presents a strong contrast of them 
with a quotation from his letter to Mr. Wythe in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>.
