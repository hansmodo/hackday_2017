DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 19th inst. came to hand yesterday. On the same evening arrived our illustrious general, 
returning to his position on the North river. We shall probably, however, have his company here for some days at least, 
where he will be able to give Congress very seasonable aid in 
settling the military establishment for the next year, about 
which there is some diversity of opinion. Whatever the total 
requisition of men may be on the States, I cannot but wish that 
Virginia may take effectual measures for bringing into the field 
her proportion of men. One reason for this wish is the calumnies which her enemies ground on her present deficiency ; but 
the principal one is the influence that such an exertion may 
have in preventing insults and aggressions, from whatever 
quarter they may be meditated, by shewing that we are able to 
defy them.

The Delegates have lately transmitted to the G-overnor, for 
the Assembly, all the proceedings which have taken place on 
the subject of the Territorial cessions. The tenor of them, and 
the reception given them by the Assembly, will, I doubt not, be 
communicated to you by some of your correspondents in it.

There is pretty good reason to believe that a descent on 
Minorca has actually taken place. It is a little problematical 
with me whether successes against Great Britain in any other 
quarter except America tend much to hasten a peace. If they 
increase her general distress, they at the same time increase 
those demands against her which are likely to impede negotiations, and her hopes from the sympathy of other powers. They 
are favorable to us, however, in making it more the interest of 
all the belligerent powers to reject the uti possidetis as the 
basis of a pacification.

The report of Rodney's capture never deserv. the attention, 
it seems, which was given to it.

I am, Dr Sir, yrs sincerely.
