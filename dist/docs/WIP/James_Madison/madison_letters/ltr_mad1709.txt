MY DEAR SIR, Since I got to the end of my journey I have 
been without an opportunity of dropping you a line, and this is 
written merely to be ready for the first casual conveyance to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>.

I received yesterday your two favors, No. 1 and 2. The Gazettes, under a preceding cover, had come to hand some days 
before. Your answer to Hammond has, on the whole, got triumphantly through the ordeal. It is certainly not materially 
injured, though, perhaps, a little defaced, by some of the criticisms to which you have yielded. The points on which you did 
not relax appear to me to be fully vindicated; the main ones 
unanswerably so. The doctrine which would make the States 
the contracting parties could have been as little expected from 
that quarter as it is irreconcilable with the tenor of their confederation. The expectation of Hammond, if sincere, of final 
instructions by the meeting of Congress, throws light, I think, 
on the errand of Bond. He can scarcely calculate on the result of his Court's reconsideration of the subject within the 
short time allowed by five months, after deducting the double 
voyage.

I have from Kentucky down to the 8th May. Little 
depredations from the savages continue to be complained of. 
The people, however, are chiefly occupied with the approaching 
distribution of the new offices. Nothing is said as to their probable Gov r . Congress and the Judiciary are thought of more 
importance to the State. Brown can be what he pleases. Some 
are disposed to fix him on the Bench. None will object to his 
going into the Senate, if that should be his choice. Campbell 
and Muter are the other names in conversation for the Senate, 
and Brackenridge and Greenup for the House of Representatives. I have this information from a Mr. Taylor, a pretty intelligent man, engaged in their public affairs. George Nicholas 
specifies no names, observ.g that it is impossible to conjecture 
those that will succeed in the competitions. Among the contents of the enclosed letter is a printed copy of the Constitution 
of Kentucky, as finally agreed to. You can take out that or 
anything else for perusal, as you please, after which you will be 
good enough to have the letter handed in such way as you may 
judge best. I would not have thrown the trouble on you if 
any other channel had occurred.

The unpopularity of the excise has evidently increased in this 
quarter, owing partly to the effect of Sidney',* who has found 
his way here, and partly to the unavoidable vexations it carries into the family distilleries. 
</p><p>
The tax on newspapers is another article of grievance. It is 
not very well understood, but if it were, it would not be satisfactory: first, because too high; secondly, because suspected of 
being an insidious forerunner of something worse. I am afraid 
the subscriptions will soon begin to be withdrawn from the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> papers, unless some step be speedily taken to prevent it. The best that occurs seems to be to advertize that the 
papers will not be put into the mail, but sent, as heretofore, to all 
who shall not direct them to be put into the mail. Will you 
hint this to Freneau? His subscribers in this quarter seem 
pretty well satisfied with the degree of regularity and safety 
with which they get the papers, and highly pleased with the 
paper itself.

I found this country labouring under a most severe drought. 
There had been no rain whatever since the 18th or 20th of 
April. The flax and oats generally destroyed; the corn dying 
in the hills. No Tobacco planted, and the wheat in weak land 
suffering; in the strong, not injured materially; in the very 
strong, perhaps benefited. Eight days ago there was a very 
local shower here. A day or two after, a better, but still very 
local. Neither of them, from appearances, extended as far south 
as Albemarle. For several days past it has rained almost constantly, and is still raining, with the wind from North East, 
with every appearance of a general rain; so that the only danger now is of too much wet for the wheat, which I am happy to 
find has effectually supplanted tobacco in the conversation and 
anxieties of our crop-mongers, and is rapidly doing so in their 
fields.

I met the President on the road. I had no conversation 
with him, but he handed me a letter which he had written to 
me at home. Its contents are very interesting, but do not absolutely decide the problem* which dictated yours to him. 
</p><p>
Monroe and his lady left us on Wednesday, on their way 
home. He is to meet the revisors at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> about the 15th. 
I understood Mrs. M. was to be added to the family at Monticello during his absence. 
</p><p>
Will you be so good as to cover under your next a copy of 
Mease's inaugural oration on the Hydrophobia? Rush sent me 
a copy, which had just been printed, the morning I set out, for 
D r Jones. I wished to have got one for another friend, but had 
not time. If the bulk will permit, send two, and I will send 
one for the amusement of Gilmer, who, I hear, though through 
imperfect channels, is still in a critical situation. 
Always and affectionately yours.

The promised list of names is enclosed. When your Tableau 
of national debts and polls is made out, may I ask a copy?
