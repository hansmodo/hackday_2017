DEAR SIR, Yours of August 3d has just come to hand. All 
the preceding have been acknowledged. I am extremely mortified, in looking for the Key to the Cypher, to find that I left 
it in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. You must therefore repeat anything that 
may be of use still to be known, particularly anything that may 
relate to the time of your leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, which I wish to 
know as long as possible before it takes place. The task on 
which you have put me must be abridged, so as not to go beyond 
that period. You will see that the first topic is not yet completed. I hope the 2 d and 3 d , to wit, the meaning of the Treaty 
and the obligations of gratitude, will be less essential. The 
former is particularly delicate, and tho' I think it may be put 
in a light that would reflect ignominy on the author of P., yet 
I had rather not meddle with the subject, if it could be avoided. 
</p><p>
I cannot say when I shall be able to take up those two parts 
of the job. Just as I was embarking in the general subject, I 
received from the reputed Author of Franklin a large pamphlet, 
written by him against the fiscal system, particularly the Bank, 
which I could not but attend to. It is put on a footing that requires me to communicate personally with Monroe, whom I 
ought to have seen before this, as the publication of the work 
is to be contrived for the Author. It really has merit, always 
for its ingenuity, generally for its solidity, and is enriched with 
many fine strokes of imagination, and a continued vein of pleasantry and keen satire, that will sting deeply. I have received 
a letter from the Author, wishing to hear from me. I must, 
therefore, take a ride as far asCharlottesville,as soon as I make 
out the next packet for you, and suspend the residue of the business till I return. I shall endeavour in my absence to fulfil a 
promise to Wilson Nicholas, which will lengthen the suspension. I forward to F. a copy of the little thing of L d Ch.; the 
last sentence is struck out as not necessary, and which may, 
perhaps, wound too indiscriminately certain characters not at 
present interested in supporting public corruptions. 
The paper for J. F. could not otherwise get to him than with 
your aid. You must therefore take the trouble of having it 
handed into the Post Office, whence the penny post will take it, 
unless you can do it at some shorter hand. I wish you would 
look over what is said critically, and if you think there be any 
thing of importance wrong, or that may do more harm than 
good, that you will either erase it, where that will not break the 
sense, or arrest the whole till I can make the correction. Delay, I know, is bad; but vulnerable parts that would be seized 
for victories and triumphs would be worse. I beg you, also, to 
attend particularly to those passages slightly marked with a 
pencil: the first, the declaration of the principles and sentiments 
of the Author; the 2 d , beginning with, "Writers such as Locke 
and Montesquieu," &c., to the pencil mark in the IT. 3 d . The 
quotation from the Federalist. If you think the first had better 
be omitted, it can come out without leaving the least gap; so 
can the 2 11 . My doubts as to that proceed from the danger of 
turning the controversy too much into the wilderness of books. 
I use Montesquieu, also, from memory, tho', I believe, without inaccuracy. The 3 d can also come out without affecting the piece; 
and I wish you to erase it, if you think the most scrupulous delicacy, conjecturing the Author, could disapprove it. One N. 
more, or two short Nos., will close the first topic and supersede 
the last. They will be sent as soon as finished and copied. 
These would have been sent somewhat sooner, but for the delay 
caused by the last circumstance.

The drought has done irreparable injury to the corn in many 
parts of the country. It has been interrupted, within a few days 
past, by a pretty extensive rain. We shared in it here but 
scantily. I understand that at Charlottesville, which had been 
favored with preceding ones, it was plentiful. Be good enough 
to contrive an excuse to Mr. Randolph, at Monticello, for my 
not forwarding the Gazettes latterly, if you have not already 
thought of it. I know not how to apologize myself, and shall 
feel some awkwardness, as I shall not carry them when I go 
into his neighborhood.
