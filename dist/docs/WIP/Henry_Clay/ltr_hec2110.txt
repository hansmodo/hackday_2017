Dear Sir, I have received as well your letter by Mr. H. Taylor, as the one written a few days after, by the post. 
</p><p>
I must request the favor of you to execute a small commission 
for me. The Acts of the Virginia Legislature, passed prior to 
the separation of this State, are extremely difficult to be procured, 
even by collecting fugitive Acts, in this country ; but few indeed 
of the public offices possess entire collections. If ill you be so 
obliging as to obtain for me, if you can, the old revisal, which 
reaches, I believe, to the year 1766, the Chancellor revisal, and 
the Acts passed since that, in a regular series to the year 1792. 
The last is most desired, but I could wish to possess all. Your 
revisal of 1791 would not answer my purpose, because it contains laws not in force in this country, and, if my recollection 
serves me, omits to give the respective dates of the passages of 
each law, all-important in many cases. These books you will 
be pleased to forward to William Taylor, Esq., merchant, in 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, from whom I can easily procure them ; or to either 
of our representatives in Congress, Mr. Brown, Mr. Breckenridge, 
Fowler, or Davis, who will contrive some mode for them to get 
to me. I suppose they may be obtained from the Council Chamber. 
</p><p>
What has become of the son of my much regretted friend, 
your brother? I feel myself under obligations of gratitude to 
the father, which I should be happy of having an opportunity of 
discharging to the son. What is the progress he has made in 
his education? We have in this place an university in a very 
flourishing condition. Could you not spare him to me in this 
country for two or three years? I live at a short distance from 
the buildings, have a small family, and need not add, that from 
the cheapness of living in this country, his expense to me would 
be extremely inconsiderable. We have, too, a distant hope of 
getting <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison</a>, from William and Mary, to take the management of our seminary. Be pleased to let me hear from you on this subject.
