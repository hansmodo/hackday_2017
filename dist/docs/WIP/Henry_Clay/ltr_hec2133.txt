My dear Sir, I have received the three last letters which 
you have done me the favor to write to me. On the subject to 
which they relate, there appears to be an eddy at this moment. 
We shall soon see which way the currents will break out. Information from -every quarter assures us that the caucus here has 
impaired, instead of advancing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> prospects. The 
convention at Harrisburg, no doubt, the day before yesterday, 
recommended <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> ; and they probably forebore to 
make any recommendation of a Vice-President ; or, if they did 
/ make any, I think it was <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>. At Albany they are 
probably looking to Harrisburg, and waiting for events. It is 
now believed, that the Senate of New York will reject the Electoral Bill, the committee of that body having made a report 
against it. But, rest assured, that all inferences derived from 
that fact in favor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> are utterly fallacious. He 
can not obtain the vote of that State. 
</p><p>
I concur with you in thinking that my friends at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> 
 
</p><p>
and in Virginia ought to avoid, if possible, all misunderstanding 
with those of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> ; and a temperate and conciliatory 
character would therefore be best to be given to any appeal made 
to the people in my behalf. 
</p><p>
I have just heard that De Witt Clinton has arrived here. I 
pray you not to think it necessary to answer every letter which 
I may address to you. I should be glad to hear from you occasionally, and when perfectly convenient.
