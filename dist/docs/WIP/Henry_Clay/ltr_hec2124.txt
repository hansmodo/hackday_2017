My dear Sir, You will have seen a note which I addressed 
to the editors of the " Intelligencer," on the subject of the business of Ghent. I wish to say one word to you on it. To those 
who have attentively read the controversial papers between 
Messrs. Russell and Adams, and particularly the appendix to the 
book of the latter, it must be apparent that the honorable secretary has labored to draw me into the controversy, by the manner 
in which he has alluded to my name, and the inconsistency 
which, on one occasion, he imputes to me. I had but one alternative, either to acquiesce, by my silence, in all misrepresentations ; or, by a sort of protest, to reserve to myself the right of 
correcting errors on some future fit occasion. I might, indeed, 
have rushed into the controversy between those two gentlemen, or 
commenced a new one ; but I hope my friends will believe me 
incapable of committing such an indiscretion, as I conceive that 
would be, of doing at this time the one or the other. I chose 
the latter because of the alternative stated, and I hope you will 
approve of the step I have taken. My purpose is answered, my 
ground is taken, and those who know me will not want to be 
assured that I will adhere to both. I shall write no more until 
I think the period has arrived which I have indicated. The 
honorable secretary seems to deplore its possible distance. I 
shall remain unmoved by any regrets he may feel on account of 
the want of fresh aliment for new strife.

The newspapers will communicate to you the events which have occurred here. As they chose to have a second caucus, I 
was glad it took place before I reached Columbus. Considering 
the great efforts made from without to prevent any legislative 
expression of public opinion, the proof which is afforded by the 
vote here is extremely strong. My friends believe that from 
eighty to ninetj^ out of the one hundred and three members, who 
compose the General Assembly, are in my favor ; and there is 
among the former the greatest zeal, animation, and confidence. 
</p><p>
I am anxious to learn the names of your commissioners. Expecting to reach  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> by the 22d instant, I shall be glad 
to have the pleasure of hearing from you on my arrival there.
