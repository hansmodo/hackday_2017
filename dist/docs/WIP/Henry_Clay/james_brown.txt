Washington, September 16, 1804. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, - Your last letter was dated at the Springs, where 
you were reveling in the enjoyments of ease, mirth, and engaging 
society. Since that time you have probably experienced the 
bustle and solicitude attendant on an election, for I discover youi 
name at the head of the list of successful candidates. 
</p><p>
Nancy [Mrs. Brown] was delighted at finding that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="kin friend met">Lucretia</a> 
[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="kin friend met">Mrs. Clay</a>, sister of Mrs. Brown] had overcome her repugnance to writing, and by the next post replied to her letter. She begs 
me to press upon you the task of urging her to write more frequently, and authorizes me to declare that although her correspondents are numerous, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="kin friend met">Lucretia</a>'s letters shall ever receive prompt answers. 
</p><p>
I have written to so many of my friends to-day, that I have 
much against my inclination, defrauded you of your share. My 
affectionate wishes for the happiness of yourself and family wait 
upon you.

New Orleans, March 12, 1805.
</p><p>
Dear Sir, - I received, two mails ago, your very acceptable 
favor of the 28th of January, and should sooner have answered 
it but for the pressure of business arising from two courts in 
session at the same time. I rejoice at every assurance I receive 
of the health and happiness of a family to whom I feel every 
attachment which a consciousness of their worth and a recollection of their friendship can inspire. The hope of a rapturous 
meeting with ^''ou shortly, consoles me under an absence which, 
without this delightful expectation, would be insupportable. 
With the young portion of my relations I feel confident of an 
interview, but poor old Colonel Hart* - am I never to see him 
again ? He has frightened me by the very circumstance which 
he mentions as flattering to his hope of long life. He informs 
me that his weight has increased twenty-three pounds since his 
return from the Springs. I consider this as an unfavorable 
omen, but will feel perfectly relieved from all apprehensions if 
he survives the month of March. 
</p><p>
It gives me real pleasure to hear from every quarter that you 
stand in Kentucky at the head of your profession. May you 
soon grow rich, and be able to retire from a profession, the duties 
of which are too severe in that inclement climate for the most 
robust constitution. My retreat from your State saved my life. 
One winter more would have fixed upon me a confirmed consumption. Her^ I have renewed my youth. 
</p><p>
Nancy has written to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="kin friend met">Lucretia</a>. She enjoys good health, good 
spirits, and, as you may suppose, the esteem of all who know 
her. 
</p><p>
Let me hear from you more frequently.

New Orleans, September 1, 1808. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, - Before I had the pleasure of your last very 
agreeable letter, the news of the death of our venerable friend 
[Colonel Hart] had reached us. Although in some degree prepared for the melancholy event by the account given in your 
former letter of the state of his health, I yet felt the loss with a 
degree of sensibility which was heightened by the regret I experienced by being forever denied the long expected pleasure of 
giving him a gleam of happiness in his last days, by restoring him the society of his beloved daughter. I need not tell 
you that she has suffered. You know the sensibility of her 
heart, and the warmth of her gratitude and attachment to the 
best of fathers. Reflection, however, should teach us the duty 
of yielding to the decrees of heaven. Our friend was not prematurely snatched away from us. He has left no needy infant orphans. He lived long and he lived well. His character 
is set before his family as a model of public and private virtues, 
worthy of their imitation. While they cherish his memory 
may they never depart from the example he has left them. 
</p><p>
I am sorry that you do not live in better times, for you have 
talents to adorn a public station, and to be useful to your country. But to me character is more dear than every other thing ; 
and can any man hope long to preserve it in the present miserable state of things ? You have carried your election. I am 
rejoiced at it. Your enemies will be wounded. But I pray 
you to quit public life, or muster up sufficient philosophy to bear 
up under all the hard names with which you will be christened 
in the papers. You are, it seems, a Burrite. If Wilkinson deserves to be believed, seven, thousand men in your State deserved 
the same opprobrious title. What you may next be called is 
uncertain ; but as long as you retain your brains and your independence you will be abused. Republicanism demands that a 
man of talents should be kept down by detraction. Too much 
genius, like too much wealth, destroys equality, the very soul 
of democracy. But I forbear. You will say I have become 
splenetic, or rather that I have always been subject to that infirmity. Nothing is further from the fact. Ever since my arrival 
in this merry dancing country my temper has remained unruffled, with the exception of Wilkinson's winter of horrors. In domestic Kfe I have nothing to wish, and my practice has been 
more prosperous than I had any right to expect. It is with pleasm-e that I discover that your rage for electioneering has not 
diverted your mind from the main point ; and that the people, 
while they rail at the profession of 'aw, vie with each other in 
filling the coffers of its professors. Happy in the bosom of your 
family may you long enjoy the fruits of your labors, and transmit liberal educations and competent fortunes to your descendants
</p><p>
Present my affectionate regards to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="kin friend met">Lucretia</a> and the family.

Paris, October 13, 1825. 
</p><p>
Sir, - I had the pleasure of receiving your letter sent by the 
Brandywine, and most sincerely sympathize with you and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met kin"><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="kin friend met">Mrs. Clay</a></a> in the sad calamity you have suffered in the loss of your 
dear little daughter. She had attained that age at which children 
are particularly interesting, and in the absence of her sisters, 
would have been for many years an agreeable companion to her 
mother. These, however, are misfortunes which it pleases 
Providence to inflict, and for which time and resignation are the 
only remedies. It has, perhaps, been fortunate that this melancholy event has been succeeded immediately by the variety of 
traveling, and the occupation attendant on forming a new establishment. These serve in some degree to divert the mind from 
its afflictions, and to blunt the edge of misfortune. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="">General Lafayette</a> has arrived in good health at Lagrange, and I sincerely hope he will wisely avoid any interference in 
public affairs, and content with the honors he has received in the United States, will pass the remainder of his days in tranquillity.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - I am happy to find that you have borne your 
disappointment and loss of place with so much true philosophy. 
If you have lost your office, you will regain your health and improve your fortune, and therefore I think you may felicitate 
yourself on the result. I hope, as you love a little agitation, 
you will obtain a seat in the House of Representatives, where 
your weight of talents will be felt, and where, by resuming your 
cheerfulness and former popular manners, you will again fill a 
high place in the esteem of the nation. The outs have acted 
wisely in resolving not to set up opposition until the new Administration shall have done something which merits opposition.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - You will see by the papers our safe arrival 
announced in the unusually short passage of twenty-four days, 
during which time we enjoyed fine weather, excellent accommodations, and good society, in a splendid packet with an obliging captain. Mrs. Brown suffered throughout the voyage from seasickness, but I am happy in assuring you that her general health, 
if not materially improved, is certainly not impaired by the 
voyage. We have been received with the most flattering attentions by the respectable inhabitants of the city. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to write to me in Philadelphia and let us know 
how you are, and what you are doing. They say here that 
many are anxious to make you President. Are you not tired of 
the troubled ocean of politics, or will you again launch into the 
busy strife ? I hope my poor bark is once more safe in port, and 
it is not my intention again to meddle with politics unless driven 
to it by ill usage or persecution, which I do not now apprehend. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to present our love to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="kin friend met">Mrs. Clay</a> and all our dear relations. We are impatient to see them, but find Mrs. Brown's health too delicate to bear the journey.

Philadelphia, September 3, 1832. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, - I have received, with feelings of the deepest 
sorrow, the intelligence of the decease of our lamented Mrs. Hart, conveyed by your letter. I had resided, for twelve months 
after my marriage, under her hospitable roof, during which time, 
and ever since, I received from her every proof of kindness and 
affection which could have been bestowed on me by my own 
mother. Alas ! how much, in many essential particulars, she resembled my dear Nancy, and how soon she has followed her ! 
I fondly trust that that beneficent Father of the Universe who 
has, during their lives, bestowed on them so many blessings, has 
graciously re-united them in the regions of everlasting bliss.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, - I had the pleasure to receive, by the newspapers, 
the intelligence of Henry's marriage, and to learn by your last 
letter that his choice is every way agreeable to his family, and 
what is more important, such as to promise him future happiness. Be so kind as to accept my congratulations on the event, 
^ and to offer to the newly married pair my sincere wishes that 
they may enjoy a long life of union and prosperity. 
</p><p>
The intelligence of your death was accompanied, perhaps preceded, by its contradiction. I sincerely hope that you may feel 
no serious consequences from your indisposition, and that you 
may resume your seat in the Senate with a disposition to be 
satisfied with a place which I would have preferred to any within the reach of American ambition. You know that I have 
never for a moment doubted that General Jackson would be reelected. He will have a large majority in this State, and I shall 
not be surprised should he be the choice of every State south of 
the Potomac, and west of the Alleghany. If I have proved 
more generally correct in my calculations than many of our active politicians, it may be accounted for by the fact that I derive 
my information almost exclusively from my knowledge of the 
American tendencies, my acquaintance with nearly all the prominent actors in the political theater, and the perusal of the journals, without entering into the busy scenes of active electioneering, by which my deliberate judgment might be warped, or 
conversing with eloquent and heated partisans, who might inflame my imagination.
