 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, June 21,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a>.

Dear Sir, I received your obliging favor of the 7th instant 
from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, with the proclamation of the Governor of 
New York inclosed. I was of course prepared to expect that 
measure, the only effect of which will be, should the Legislature 
pass the proposed law, to place the vote of that State to some 
candidate other than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>. 
</p><p>
We have nothing new at the West, where I find every thing 
to be as I expected. You will see candidates announced for 
election in this State for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, etc. This is the result of the absence of all sort of concert by means of 
caucuses, or other nominating appendages in Kentucky. Every 
body who chooses puts himself forward as a candidate. The 
State is divided into three districts, according to which it has given 
its electoral vote for many years past. No change was made in 
consequence of one of its own citizens being brought forward, 
because it was known that no change was necessary to insure 
him the entire vote of the State. Nor is there a county, parish, 
or a respectable neighborhood in the whole State, in which he 
would not obtain the majority over all competition. In Ohio, 
Indiana, and Illinois, as well as in Missouri, the result I believe 
to be equally certain. I shall go to Columbus to attend the 
Federal Court, which begins there on the second Monday in July. 
Should you write to me at any time after the receipt of this 
letter, and before the 20th of July, be pleased to address me at 
that place. I am anxious to see the indications, which will 
shortly be given at the South, of the dispositions of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> friends, should he be withdrawn, of which I do not doubt, 
sooner or later. My interest, I think, will be benefited by his 
being continued to be held up for some time to come. The 
tariff fever will have then somewhat abated. My respectful 
compliments to Mrs. Johnston.
