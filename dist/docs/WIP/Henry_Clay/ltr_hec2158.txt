My dear Sir, I received your kind letter of the 29th ultimo, 
and thank you for the friendly expression of sympathy which it 
contains. Our late affliction was rendered still more severe by 
the circumstances under which it occurred. I did not yield to 
the urgent calls of duty here, until I had the strongest assurances 
from the attending physician that there was no danger. And, 
after leaving Lebanon, the first information I received of the sad 
event which occurred there, reached me, when I was within 
about twenty miles of this place, through the " Intelligencer."

I received, perused, and now retain Judge Duval's letter. His 
wishes in behalf of his son will be considered ; but the fact that 
he has one son a governor under the general Government and 
another holding a captain's commission (this latter now applying 
for another appointment), will operate somewhat against his success. 
</p><p>
You must feel gratified that our old friend Troop has finally 
concluded to abstain from surveying the Creek lands, and of 
course that all danger is dissipated of disturbing the public peace.
