Dear Sir, The contemplated changes in the judicial establishment of the United States, were not made during the session 
of Congress just terminated. The opinion that these changes 
are necessary acquires daily additional strength ; and I think 
there is reason to believe that they will be effected at the next 
session.

I am glad to learn that there exists a prospect of doing something towards turnpiking in Kentucky. I shall be very happy 
to co-operate with you in an object so worthy of the utmost 
exertions.
