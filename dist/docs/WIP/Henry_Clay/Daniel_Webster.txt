</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, - I am obliged to you for a copy of your address 
to your constituents. It has been widely circulated here, is 
universally read, and highly commended. I have heard but one 
opinion as to its general merits. Some think that part which 
relates to Mr. Kremer's letter, and the incidents connected with 
it, was an unnecessary labor, at least so far as regards the state 
of public opinion this way. That transaction seems to have 
made no impression here. The part of your address which sets 
forth your reasons for preferring another candidate to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> is composed, in my opinion, with great skill and ability, 
and I have no doubt it will produce a very strong effect. It is 
a very good case, very ably managed. 
</p><p>
We are very quiet in this quarter. There is very little dissatisfaction, and no disposition, that I discover, to opposition. 
</p><p>
With almost all there prevails a very good spirit ; and the exceptions are not important, from weight of character or influence. 
</p><p>
I have heard nothing, since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, respecting the 
English mission. If any thing has occurred, not improper for 
me to know, I should be glad to learn it from you at your leisure ; and I shall be gratified also to hear from you on other subjects and occasions.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, - Under another cover I send you what has occurred to me on the subject of our trade with England. The 
object of this is, to express my sympathy for your domestic calamity, and to offer my congratulations on the welcome so ardent 
and so universal, which seems to have greeted you among your 
fellow-citizens of the West. The same kindness of feeling 
which has been expressed in that quarter, exists, I believe, in 
other places. I have been through New York in the course of 
the summer, and I found almost every where, a hearty approbation, and every where else, at least, an entire and not uneasy 
acquiescence, in regard to the events of last winter, and to your 
own agency in producing those events. In New England, with 
here and there a little expression of spleen from the disappointed, 
the great majority of the people have the best disposition toward 
the Government, in all its parts. Our ability in Congress is not 
so great as it might have been, and as it ought to have been. 
But that evil admits of no immediate cure. 
</p><p>
You must allow me to admonish you to take care of your 
health. Knowing the ardor and the intensity with which you 
may probably apply yourself to the duties of your place, I fear 
very much you may overwork yourself. Somebody (was it not 
an Austrian minister?) on being asked how he could get through 
so much business, replied that he did it by repudiating two false 
maxims, which had obtained currency among men ; that, for 
his part, he never did any thing to-day, which he could put off 
till to-morrow ; nor any thing himself, which he could get 
another to do for him. Without following his example, strictly 
and literally, I still think you ought to be a good deal governed 
by the same rules, especially the last.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - We are glad to learn, through the papers, that 
you have been able to leave the city for a little visit into Marylaud, as it gives us reason to hope that you have recovered from 
your recent indisposition. 
</p><p>
You will have noticed Mr. Lloyd's resignation. I did not expect it at this moment, although I was apprised of his wish to 
leave the Senate as soon as he could. It was with difficulty he 
was persuaded to attend the last session. The Legislature being 
now in session, his place will be immediately filled. I incline 
to think that the appointment will fall on Mr. Silsby, It has 
been intimated to me, indeed, that a different arrangement might, perhaps, be made, if I should approve it ; but my impression at present is against it, and I believe for very good reasons. 
</p><p>
Mr. Silsby you know. He is entirely well disposed, and is a 
well-informed merchant and a respectable man. It is not likely 
he would take much part in the discussions of the Senate ; but 
would bring a good deal of useful knowledge into the body, and 
might be entirely relied on to support all just and proper measures. According to general usage here, a senator would now be 
appointed for six years, commencing next March, at the end of 
Mr. Mills' present term of office ; but I think it probable enough, 
that having to fill the vacancy, occasioned by the resignation of 
Mr. Lloyd, now, the Legislature may choose to postpone the 
other election to the winter. If the choice should come on now, 
I understand Mr. Mills will be re-elected. If postponed, it may 
be a little uncertain, it is said, as some suppose our Governor has 
an inclination for the place. There are here, in the Legislature 
and out, a few very busy persons, who are hostile to the administration. They have no system, but act, in every case, pro rata, and content themselves with the general principle, applied 
in all cases, and indiscriminately, of opposing. They will probably support Mr. Lincoln against Mr. Mills, from an idea that Mr. Mills' appointment would gratify the friends of the President, or 
is a thing arranged by his friends, although Mr. Lincoln is known 
to be equally friendly. Some embarrassment may happen from 
this source, very possibly ; but I trust it can be overcome. 
</p><p>
I have great pleasure in assuring you that nothing can be 
more correct or more decisive than public opinion in this part 
of the country, in regard to the various transactions of the last 
session. 
</p><p>
The sentiment of the people is exactly what you would expect and wish it to be. 
</p><p>
In New Hampshire the Legislature meets next week. The 
two senators will doubtless be present on that occasion, and we 
are looking with some interest to see whether Mr. Woodbury 
and the editor of the " Patriot" (publisher of the laws !) will be 
able to bring the Legislature and people of that State to their 
way of thinking.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - The subject of the recent British order is exciting some little attention, as you will have observed, in the commercial cities, and there are those, doubtless, v/ho would embrace this, as they would any opportunity, to find fault. 
</p><p>
Mr. Lloyd has probably written you in regard to it. He feels 
more than a common share of interest on the occasion, as he 
recommended negotiation in preference to meeting the English 
proposition by an act of Congress. It may be well, perhaps, that 
some little statement, made at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, would appear, for 
the satisfaction of the public. I would not intimate that there 
is in this part of the country at least, any dissatisfaction ; but I 
see attempts are making, in New York and other places, to produce an impression that the national interests have, in this instance, been overlooked. 
</p><p>
As to the general course of political affairs, we have nothing 
of much interest in this quarter. Our elections take place next month. In some districts there may be personal changes, but 
nobody will be proposed on the ground of opposition, nor any 
body chosen who is suspected, on good grounds, of being inclined 
to join the opposition. Some few, perhaps, may be chosen, who 
profess friendship, and who will yet fly off on the first, and on 
every close question, according to the example of last winter. 
But, on the whole, the great majority from this quarter will be 
well inclined, and steady in their course. The Jackson paper in 
this city (for we have also a Jackson paper), seems to occupy itself at present very much with Mr. Everett. Mr. Everett, however, is likely to be re-elected with great unanimity. I think, 
my dear sir, without intending a compliment, that your speech 
at Lewisburg has done real service. It was happy and excellent, 
even for you, both in matter and manner. We all rejoice here 
- I mean all who do not fear that you were born to prevent 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General J.</a> from being President - in the improvement of your 
health ; and you must allow me to express my most anxious and 
earnest hope that you will not overwork yourself the ensuing 
session and winter. What can not be done without the sacrifice 
of your health must be left undone, at whatever expense or 
hazard. I have often thought of suggesting to you one practice, 
if you have not already adopted it, which I have found very useful myself, when my own little affairs have occasionally pressed me ; that is, the constant employment of an amanuensis. The 
difference between writing at the table and dictating to another, 
is very great. The first is tedious, exhausting, debilitating labor ; 
the last may be done while you are pacing a large room, and enjoying in that way the benefit of an erect posture, and a healthy exercise. If I were you I would not touch a pen, except to write 
my frank. Make the clerks do all that clerks can do, and for 
the rest dictate to an amanuensis. I venture to say, that if you 
once get accustomed to this, you will find your labor greatly 
lightened. 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of hearing from several Kentucky and 
Ohio friends during the summer ; and have had much gratification in learning the favorable state of opinion in those important states. The only incident to be regretted much, in the West, is 
the loss of Cook's election. His friends must remember him, 
and sustain him, in some public service, according to his merits.

My dear Sir, - After company went out last night, and I had

Probably, I should have voted against any further publication ; 
but I am now fully satisfied this will do good. The statement 
is clear, and the evidence irresistible, I am satisfied, upon my 
conscience, that the whole business originated with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General J.</a>

My dear Sir, - Your reply to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a>'s letter is admirable, and has been most favorably received every where, at least on this side the Allegheny. It places the General in a position where he can not remain. He must move, in some direction ; and, whatever movement he makes, will either embarrass 
his friends, or still more embarrass himself. I have a suspicion 
that the respectable member of Congress is Mr. Buchanan. If 
this should turn out so, it will place him in an awkward situation, since, it seems, he did recommend a bargain with your 
friends, on the suspicion that such a bargain had been proposed 
to them on the part of the friends of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. I am curious

My DEAR Sir, - My letter to Colonel Johnson was not important, and the delay in its transmission is of no moment. 
</p><p>
You speak very modestly of recent events, in which you 
have borne so distinguished and so successful a part. I can 
not think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> will ever recover from the blow 
which he has received. Your speech at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, in point of 
merit, as a clear and well stated argument, is certainly at the 
head of all your efforts ; and its effects on public opinion have 
not been exceeded by those of any political paper, I may almost 
say, within my recollection. Buchanan is treated too gently. 
Many persons think his letter candid. I deem otherwise. It 
seems to me he has labored very hard to protect the General, as 
far as he could without injury to himself. Although the General's friends this way, however, affect to consider Buchanan's letter as supporting the charge, it is possible the Genera] himself, and the Nashville Committee may think otherwise, and complain of Buchanan. I should expect this, with some confidence, if they received the letter a little earlier than they may have seen the turn which the Atlantic editors have attempted to 
give it. As these last have pretty generally agreed to say that 
the letter does support the General, the Nashville commentators, 
if they see the example in season, may be disposed to follow it. 
I do not yet learn what answer comes from that quarter to your 
speech.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - You will have seen some proofs of the prevailing sentiments, on public subjects, in this quarter. The best possible feeling was indicated at the meeting on the 5th. I do 
not mean in regard to myself, but on general subjects, and in 
respect to others. The toast in which you were named was received with the most enthusiastic applause. I do not think I have ever seen, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, a meeting comprising so much character, talent, influence, and respectability. I hope it may do good. 
</p><p>
One objection, my dear sir, which I have to writing to you, 
is, that your courtesy and kindness lead you always to answer 
me, and I feel that it is wrong, in the present state of your health 
and of your engagements, to impose any new duty, though it be 
a trifling one, upon you. I will really take it as a greater proof 
of friendship and confidence, if, how often soever I may write, 
you will forbear all reply, unless when there is something which 
you wish to say.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - We have heard with great pleasure of your 
safe arrival at your own home, after your interesting trip down 
the great river ; and we all enjoyed, as sincerely as you could 
have done, the tokens of regard and affection which the good 
people manifested toward you at the various points of your tour. 
More than all, it was gratifying to hear from Mr. Poinsett such 
excellent accounts of your health. 
</p><p>
The President means to be re-elected. He has meant so all 
along. Seeing this. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague">Van Buren</a> has been endeavoring to make 
a merit of persuading him to do so, on the ground of its being 
necessary to keep the party together. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague antagonist">Calhoun</a> is more than 
half reconciled to it from two considerations : first, he hardly feels 
as confident as he has done, of his own present strength ; second, 
he regards the chance of succession, in seven years, as pretty 
important. If any thing should prevent <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> from 
being a candidate for re-election, my hopes would now be exceeding strong of beating both <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague">Van Buren</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague antagonist">Calhoun</a>. How it will be expedient for us to act, in case the present incumbent 
should actually be candidate again, we can better determine 
hereafter. My own firm belief is, that if we were to let the 
Administration, this session and the next, have their own way, 
and follow out their own principles, they would be so unpopular 
as that the General could not possibly be re-elected. I do not 
mean by this, that we should let them disturb the Tariff, or 
injure any other existing interest ; still less that we should, in 
the slightest degree, vote or act against our own principles. All 
these being safe, and all existing interests preserved, I still think 
if we leave to them to decide on new measures of internal improvement, etc., according to their own will, they will soon find what the sense of the people is. Bat I forbear further talk.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - We are all with the foot in the stirrup, and are 
not leaving in a very composed state. The passage of the Indian bill, and the rejection of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=maysville" rel="city">maysville</a> Turnpike bill, have occasioned unusual excitement. The quarrel, yesterday, between Stansbury and others who voted for the bill, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">Polk</a>, Bell, etc., was -very warm. There is more ill blood raised, I 
should think, than would easily be quieted again. 
</p><p>
We think all recent occurrences have been quite favorable, 
and that the present prospect is cheering. We have had no formal 
meeting. After much consideration, that idea was given up. 
We found it difficult to assemble a few friends without giving 
offense ; or a great number without the danger of attracting too 
much notice. We have had, however, a very full and free interchange of opinions, for the last three weeks, and are all harmonious in purpose and design, and in good spirits. We incline 
to think no formal nominations at present advisable, though 
friends press us to such a measure from divers quarters of the 
country. It has seemed to us, on the whole, that a formal 
nomination would not be popular enough in its character and 
origin, to do good. It would be immediately proclaimed to be 
the act of your friends acting at your instance. It would excite 
jealousies on the one hand, which are now fast dying away, and 
on the other, check discontents and schisms among our opponents, from which much is now to be hoped. Such is our 
view. 
</p><p>
I am much pressed to assent to a nomination of you by the 
Massachusetts Legislature now in session. Bat to this I steadily 
object, on the ground that every body knows we are perfectly 
safe and strong in Massachusetts, and a nomination there would 
only raise the cry of coalition revived. It has seemed to me the 
proper scene for the first formal action is Maryland. Her Legislature is elected in October. Our friends have the utmost confidence they will carry the State. Indeed there can be little doubt 
of it. In that event, the Maryland Legislature, next December, 
will occupy a position from which they can speak to advantage. 
Without detail, you will see, I think, at once, many advantages 
in a nomination from this quarter. None could be more favorable, unless it be 
, or Pennsylvania, neither of which, I fear, is as likely to be so soon ready for it. 
</p><p>
I hope you will think that, under all circumstances, we have 
done wisely in doing nothing. If you run against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a>, there will be an election by the electors ; and, as you justly state. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> will be chosen, unless either Virginia, 
Pennsylvania, or New York can be detached from him. Of the 
three, I have, at present, most hope of New York, and least of 
Virginia. Late occurrences will strengthen <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> in 
Virginia, and weaken him much in Pennsylvania, and perhaps 
also in New York. I am in hopes that "working men", "antimason", and "anti-auction men," etc., etc., will break down the regency. This we shall know in October. If it should turn 
out so, New York will then open a very fair field. For myself, 
I reckon on recent events as having insured us Maryland, Ohio, 
Kentucky and Indiana. This is one very good breadth. South 
of it I look for nothing but Louisiana, every thing north of it is worth a contest. 
</p><p>
I hope your friends at the West keep a steady regard to Missouri. I am told there is a good chance, or some chance, of Mr. Barton's re-election. This is matter of very great importance. 
Nothing, indeed, is more momentous to the country than the approaching election of Senators to the next Congress. 
</p><p>
On the whole, my dear sir, I think a crisis is arriving, or 
rather has arrived. I think you can not be kept back from the 
contest. The people will bring you out, nolens volens. Let 
them do it. I advise you, as you will be much watched, to stay 
at home ; or, if you wish to travel, visit your old. friends in Virginia. We should all be glad to see you at the North, but not now. You will hear from the North, every town and village in 
it, on the 4th of July. Parties must, now, necessarily, be started 
out anew ; and the great ground of difference will be Tariff and 
Internal Improvements. You are necessarily at the head of one 
party, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> will be, if he is not already, identified with the other. The question will be put to the country. Let the country decide it. 
</p><p>
I had intended to say a word about myself, but it would be to 
make a long letter still longer. When I came here it was my 
purpose to follow your example, and to vacate my seat at the end 
of this session. Events have suspended the execution of that 
purpose. How I shall think of it when I get home, I do not know. 
</p><p>
I pray kind remembrance to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="aquaintance met">Mrs. Clay</a>, and beg to assure you

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, October 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1831">1831</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, - Mr. Everett was kind enough to show me 
your letter to him, stating the results of the Kentucky election. 
</p><p>
It is doubtless true that some regret was felt in this quarter, 
that those results were not more strongly in our favor, but, upon 
the whole, a general satisfaction as to that matter now prevails, and 
all think that Kentucky has at least, by a certain, if not by a 
great majority, declared against the present Administration. For 
my own part, I can say, with great truth and sincerity, that I 
know no political men more deserving the thanks of the country, than our friends in Kentucky. I have some conception of the obstacles with which they have had to contend, not for once, 
but for many times, and their spirit, zeal, and perseverance in 
maintaining the cause of good government, place them, in my 
judgment, in the first class of really patriotic citizens. This opinion 
I often express, and it gives me always pleasure to express it. 
Whatever events may come upon us, I feel, for one, a debt of gratitude to the good men of Kentucky, for the firmness with 
which they have breasted a storm, which has threatened, and I 
think still threatens, to overturn, not only the interests and institutions, but the Constitution of the country. 
</p><p>
You must be aware, my dear sir, of the strong desire manifested in many parts of the country, that you should come into the Senate. There is, certainly, a strong feeling of that sort, 
all along the Atlantic coast. I learn its existence from private 
letters, as well as from the public newspapers. The wish is entertained here, as earnestly as any where. For myself, I hardly 
know what my own wishes are, because I suppose <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crittenden</a> will, of course, be thought of again. He has so much 
talent and fitness for the place, is, according to my apprehension 
of his character, so true and trustworthy, has done so much for 
the general good, and been so marked an object besides, for the 
opposition and reproach of the present dominant party at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, that I find myself incapable of desiring any thing incompatible with his wishes or expectations. But I know not 
what his wishes are. Independent of considerations of this 
kind, the force of which you can weigh infinitely better than I 
can, I should entirely concur with others in deeming it most expedient for you to come now into the Senate. We are to have an interesting and an arduous session. Every thing is to be 
attacked. An array is preparing much more formidable than 
has ever yet assaulted, what we think, the leading and important 
public interests. Not only the Tariff, but the Constitution itself, in its elementary and fundamental provisions, will be assailed with talent, vigor, and union. Every thing is to be 
debated, as if nothing had ever been settled. You perceive 
imposing proceedings, under high names, going on in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, You see measures adopted to try the Constitution, further South. You see, every where, I think, omens of a contest of no 
ordinary character. At the same time, discouraging things are 
happening, such as the Baltimore nomination and its acceptance. 
I assure you, my dear sir, with the prospect of toil and labor 
which is before me, if honor and conscience were not in the 
way, I would give my place to another. But these dictate to me, 
or seem to, that, so far as depends on so humble an individual 
as myself, the crisis must be met. But it would be an infinite 
gratification to have your aid, or rather your lead. I speak in 
unaffected sincerity and truth, when I say that I should rejoice, 
personally, to meet you in the Senate. I am equally sincere in 
saying that the cause would, under present circumstances be 
materially benefited by your presence there. I know nothing so 
likely to be useful. Every thing valuable in the Government 
is to be fought for, and we need your arm in the fight. At the 
same time, my dear sir, I would not, even thus privately and 
confidentially to you, say any thing not consistent with delicacy and friendship for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crittenden</a>, for whose character I have great regard, and toward whom you and ct' ^^"s have 
taught me to entertain the feelings of a friend. Would to God 
we could have you both, at this crisis in the public councils. 
</p><p>
I ought to thank you for your kindness to several friends of 
mine, who have visited you in the course of the season. They 
express themselves highly gratified by your hospitality and good 
offices. 
</p><p>
I pray a most respectful remembrance to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="aquaintance met">Mrs. Clay</a>, and hope 
that at some time, on one or the other side of the mountains, 
Mrs. Webster may have the pleasure of making her acquaintance. Clark, Letcher, and Kincaird, I believe, are not at great 
distances from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. If you see them, tender my regards 
to them. I hope you will let me hear from you.

My dear Sir, - I have at length reached this point, after having been greatly delayed by the state of the roads, produced by excessive rains. Such are the accounts here of the state of 
health, in the towns and near the rivers, and to the southward 
of it, that my future movements, and the extent to which I may 
prosecute my journey, have become uncertain. The season, too, 
seems now rapidly advancing into hot weather. I have thought 
it due to your kindness and proffered hospitality to make this 
suggestion, lest you should stay at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, in expectation of 
my being there, after the time when it would be agreeable to 
you, under existing circumstances, to leave home. I pray you 
not to stay a day for me, since it is so uncertain whether I shall 
get to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. 
</p><p>
I have heard only to-day the dreadful account about poor Johnston. It is inexpressibly shocking.

My DEAR Sir, - Your kind letter of the 17th was put into my 
hands at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, on the morning of the 20th, just as I was 
getting into the carriage on my departure for this place. With 
whatever reluctance, and it was certainly very great, I found it 
unavoidable that I should give up the Kentucky portion of my 
journey ; since, even though I felt no fear about personal safety, 
I should yet find those whom I wished to see either in alarm or 
in affliction. Now that the scourge has departed, as I hope, 
from your immediate neighborhood, and although Providence 
has kindly protected your own roof, yet I can well conceive that 
you must have lost valued friends, and that so terrible a visitation 
has left a shock which must continue to be felt for some time. 
</p><p>
It is my purpose to proceed immediately to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, and 
thence by the shortest route to New York and New England. 
I find Mr. Ewing here, as well as General M. Arthur and 
other friends. He expresses great pleasure at the escape of your 
family from the calamity. There is no sickness here, though a 
case of cholera is reported as having occurred at Portsmouth. 
</p><p> 
I sincerely hope you will not give up your intended visit to 
the North. All along the country there is a very general expectation of seeing you, and the disappointment will not be small, should you not come. 
</p><p>
I beg you to make my best regards to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="aquaintance met">Mrs. Clay</a>, and say to 
her, that I will venture to give her my word that if she will 
visit the North, she will find her tour pleasant and agreeable, and 
her welcome every where hearty. 
</p><p>
