My dear Sir, I received your obliging favor of the 14th. 
The ticket formed by my friends at Richmond, appears to me, 
upon the whole, to be extremely judicious ; and its good effect 
elsewhere, I think I am not deceived in. The Senate of New 
York, has by a vote of seventeen to fourteen, postponed the 
Electoral Bill. The first and most certain effect of that note is 
to prevent Mr. Clinton from being a candidate ; and I have no 
doubt that that was the principal object with the majority. If 
there had been a popular election of electors, he would probably 
have come out, and very likely would have obtained the vote 
of that State.

The course of Mr. Randolph's friends about Richmond surprises me. My conscience acquits rtie entirely of all blame 
toward that gentleman. Throughout all our acquaintance he 
has ever been the assailant. I have ever been on the defensive. 
The House of Representatives has ever taken part with me, and 
against him, in every collision that I ever had with him.
