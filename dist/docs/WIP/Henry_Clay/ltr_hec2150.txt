[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">MR. CLAY</a>] TO FRANCIS P. BLAIR.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 29,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>. 
</p><p>
My DEAR Blair, I received this morning your very agreeable 
favor of the 17th instant. A letter from you is always refreshing ; and I wish that I could entitle myself to expect them more 
frequently, by more punctuality and diligence on my part in 
our correspondence. My last letter informed you of the unction that was unceasingly applied to me by all the returned candidates for the Presidency, or rather their friends. Since then 
I have avowed my intention to support <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, under actual circumstances, and thereupon the oil has been instantly 
transformed into vinegar. The friends of have turned 
upon me, and with the most amiable unanimity agree to vituperate me. I am a deserter from democracy ; a giant at intrigue ; have sold the West sold myself defeating General Jackson's election to leave open the Western pretensions that 
I may hereafter fill them myself blasting all my fair prospects, 
etc., etc. To these are added a thousand other of the most gentle and kind, and agreeable epithets and things in the world. 
</p><p>
', who are themselves straining every nerve to elect 
</p><p>
Jackson that the claims of the West may be satisfied and I be 
thereby pretermitted, are accusing me of acting on their own 
principles. The knaves can not comprehend how a man can be 
honest. They can not conceive that I should have solemnly 
interrogated my conscience and asked it to tell me seriously 
what I ought to do. That it should have enjoined me not to 
establish the dangerous precedent of elevating, in this early 
stage of the Republic, a military chieftain, merely because he 
has won a great victory? That it should have told me that a 
public man is undeserving his station who will not, regardless 
of aspersions and calumnies, risk himself for his country? I 
am afraid that you will think me moved by these abuses. Be 
not deceived. I assure you that I never in my whole life felt 
more perfect composure, more entire confidence in the resolutions of my judgment, and a more unshakable determination to 
march up to my duty. And, my dear sir, is there an intelligent 
and unbiased man who must not, sooner or later, concur with 
me? <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> you know well I should never have selected, 
if at liberty to draw from the whole mass of our citizens xor a 
President. But there is no danger in his elevation now, or in 
time to come. Not so of his competitor, of whom I can not believe that killing two thousand five hundred Englishmen at 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, qualifies for the various, difficult, and complicated 
duties of the chief magistracy. I perceive that I am unconsciously writing a sort of defense, which you may possibly think 
implies guilt. What will be the result? you will ask with 
curiosity, if not anxiety. I think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> must be elected, 
such is the prevailing opinion. Still I shall not consider the matter as certain until the election is over.
