[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">MR. CLAY</a>] TO <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ftb" rel="colleague friend met">FRANCIS BROOKE</a>.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, May 28,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a>.

My dear Sir, The state of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> health is such as 
scarcely to leave a hope of his recovery. It is said that he has 
sustained a paralytic stroke. His friends begin to own that his 
death is now but too probable, and that in any event he can no 
longer be held up for the presidency. 
</p><p>
I conjecture that a visit which <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> and Governor Dickinson, of New Jersey, are about to make to Virginia, is connected with this circumstance, and that they are about to take 
measures for a fresh campaign. I thought, prior to my departure 
to-morrow, I would put you in possession of these matters. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to make my best respects to Mr. Call, and believe 
me ever faithfully your friend. 
</p><p>
[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">Henry Clay</a>]
