 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, December 20,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1823">1823</a>.

My DEAR Sir, A friend informs me that, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, my 
arrangement of the committees of the House of Representatives 
has been the subject of some animadversion, in consequence of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jab" rel="colleague met">Mr. Barbour</a>, late Speaker, not being at the head of any committee. The truth is, that it was my intention to have appointed 
him chairman of one of the most prominent committees, of the 
House, but he entreated me not to put him at the head of any 
committee, nor on any committee, which might require much of 
his time, as he wished to employ it exclusively in study. I should 
certainly not offer, even to a friend, any explanation of my official 
conduct in such a matter, if it were not to prevent misconception 
 
</p><p>
of my motives in respect to a gentleman between whom and 
myself unfortunately some competition existed. I am sure if he 
were apprised (he is now absent from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>) of the erroneous impression existing at Richmond, he would himself hasten 
to correct it. I have a full share of human frailties ; but a want 
of consideration for a competitor, in relation to any object, does 
not, if I know myself, happen to be one of them. 
</p><p>
Did you get a lengthy letter that I wrote you in August or 
September last?
