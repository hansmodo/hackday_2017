Sir, Having met with General Brown to-day, and fearing 
that I might not have the pleasure to see you, I requested him to 
make a communication to you respecting an incident which occurred in the President's house a few days ago. Upon calling 
at your lodgings this morning I was unfortunate in not finding 
you at them. The incident to which I allude is this : Upon 
leaving the President, with whom I had been engaged in official 
consultation, I unexpectedly met, on coming out of his receiving-room, at the door of it, in the adjoining room, General 
</p><p>
Brown, yourself, and a young gentleman, Mr. , to whom, as your aid, I was introduced by General Brown. Both the meeting and the introduction were entirely unexpected by me. Upon being presented to Mr. I walked up to him and offered him 
my hand in my usual manner, which he declined receiving. I remarked nothing offensive in his countenance, but he distinctly 
evinced an unwillingness to reciprocate that mode of salutation. 
Attaching no particular virtue to the touch of his hand, I turned 
off and left the room. Upon reflection on the occurrence, it appeared to me that if the young gentleman designed an affront to 
a total stranger, he could not have possibly selected an apartment 
of the President's house, at the very door of his receiving-room, 
and within the hearing, if not in the view, of the Chief Magistrate, to give the affront. I had a right, therefore, to conclude 
that he had some cutaneous disease with which he was unwilling to infect me, or that, as he kept his hand inclosed in his 
coat or waistcoat, that some newly-established etiquette forbade 
the ancient and unfashionable mode of salutation. But on my 
return from the office to my lodgings yesterday afternoon, I perceived your visiting-card, unaccompanied by that of any other 
person ; from which I have supposed that I may have misconceived the intentions of Mr. and that he really meditated offering me an insult. Upon that supposition this note is addressed to you, with the sole object that you may impress upon 
the member of your family, to whom I refer, the utility of the observance of urbanity as a necessary part of that discipline for 
which the American army, generally, is so eminently distinguished.
