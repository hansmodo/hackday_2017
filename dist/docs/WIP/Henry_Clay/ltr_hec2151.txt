My dear Sir, I received your obliging letter of the 1st inst. 
Although my letter, to which it is an answer, was not intended 
for publication, I would rather that it should be published, and 
speak for itself, than that its contents should appear through the 
medium of Mr. Ritchie's representation of them. With regard to 
its publication, you will be pleased to do as you may think proper. 
All that I feel anxious about is, that the public should not receive 
an impression that it was my intention that it should be published. 
</p><p>
My condition at this moment is most peculiar. The batteries 
of some of the friends of every man who would now be President, 
or who, four or eight years hence, would be President, are directed against me, with only the exception of those of Mr. 
Adams. Some of the friends of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, and Mr. Clinton, with very different ultimate ends, agree for the present to unite in assailing me. The object now 
is, on the part of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, to drive me 
from the course Avhich my deliberate judgment points out ; and 
for the future, on the part of Mr. Clinton and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, to 
remove me as an obstacle to their elevation. They all have yet 
to learn my character if they suppose it possible to make me 
swerve from my duty, by any species of intimidation or denunciation. But I did not expect that my old friend Ritchie would 
join in the general cry. He ought to recollect that he is struggling for a man, I for the country ^he to elevate an unfortunate 
gentleman worn down by disease, I to preserve our youthful 
institutions from the bane which has destroyed all the republics 
of the old world. I might have expected, from the patriotism 
of Thomas Ritchie, that he would have surrendered his personal 
predilections, and joined with me in the effort to save us from a 
precedent fraught with the most pernicious consequences. I am 
so far disappointed : I say it with mortification and regret. But 
all attempts to make me unite with him, to induce me to give 
up the defense of our institutions, that we may elect a sick gentleman, who has also been rejected by the great body of the 
nation, are vain and utterly fruitless. Mr. Ritchie ought to 
awake, should be himself again, and love Rome more than Caesar. 
</p><p>
I observe what you kindly tell me about the future cabinet. 
My dear sir, I want no office. When have I shown an avidity 
</p><p>
for office? In rejecting the mission to Russia, and the department of war under one administration? In rejecting the same 
department; the mission to England, or any other foreign mission, 
under the succeeding administration? If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> is elected, 
I know not who will be his cabinet ; I know not whether I 
shall be offered a pladPfe in it or not. If there should be an offer, 
I shall decide upon it, when it may be made according to my 
sense of duty. But do you not perceive that this denunciation 
of me, by anticipation, is a part of the common system between 
the discordant confederates which I have above described? 
Most certainly, if an office should be offered to me under the 
new administration, and I should be induced to think that I 
ought to accept it, I shall not be deterred from accepting it, either 
by the, denunciations of open or secret enemies, or the hypocrisy 
of pretended friends.
