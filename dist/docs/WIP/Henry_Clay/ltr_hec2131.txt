 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, February 23,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a>.
My DEAR Sir, It is some time since I had the pleasure of 
hearing from you. In the interval, several events of importance 
have occurred. The miserable attempt at a caucus, you will 
have seen accounts of. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> never could have been 
elected, but I venture to predict that the mere fact of seeking, 
by means of a caucus so got up, and so constituted, will destroy whatever prospects he ever had. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> has with- ! 
drawn. This has been produced by events in Pennsylvania, 
evincing, beyond all doubt, the determination of that State to 
support <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. The circle of competition is thus 
much circumscribed, and you may rely upon it, that you will 
have, as your next President, Adams, Jackson, or myself. You 
will have, in Virginia, to choose between these three evils. It 
is madness, it is perfect infatuation, to think, at this time, of any 
body else. Our intelligence from New York, continues to be 
favorable to the hopes of my friends. Still we shall have nothing absolutely decisive from that quarter, until time has elapsed 
to enable us to hear what the consequences there will be of the 
caucus. The present moment is one of great importance to me 
in Virginia. Now is the time to make a demonstration for me 
there, if ever. My friends accordingly, I understand, contemplate the formation of an electoral ticket for me, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
and think of putting you at the head of it, if you consent. 
Such a ticket, announced at this time, whatever may be its ultimate fate to Virginia, will have the very best effects out of Virginia. 
</p><p>
As soon as I hear from New York, I will communicate to 
you. In the mean time, I should be glad to hear from you. Mr. Crawford's friends will make an effort as long as they adhere to 
him, to exclude me from the House of Representatives, in the 
hope that my Western friends will take him, if they can not 
get me. They utterly deceive themselves. If they accomplish 
that object, and bring him into the house with Adams and Jackson, to my exclusion, he can not be elected. As I have told you 
before, the north-western States will go for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, if they 
can not get me. They will vote for no man residing in a slave 
State but me, and they vote for me because of other and chiefly 
local considerations, outweighing the slave objections. On that 
you may depend. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, then, will have the six New 
England States, and three north-western States, with the chance 
(and the best chance), for New York (if I am out of the way), 
New Jersey, Maryland, to say nothing of Alabama, Mississippi, 
and Louisiana,
