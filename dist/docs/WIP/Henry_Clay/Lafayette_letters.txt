Lagrange, October 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, - The letter of which Mr. Newcomb was the 
bearer, is the last communication I have had from you. Permit 
me to solicit a more frequent correspondence. In this exchange 
of information you may be a loser as I now am returned to a 
private, solitary life, and can hardly write any thing but what 
you will collect from European papers. Indeed the gazettes of 
France, shackled as they are, to such a reader as you, may tell, 
and even foretell a great deal. 
</p><p>
The French, or rather the European revolution, had raised 
against us the passions and the exertions of Coblentz and Pilnitz. In subsequent excesses, although it had put a stop to proselytism, it did not so generally operate abroad as the ambitious 
despotism of Napoleon who estranged from France the speculative love of freedom, and roused against her the masses of the 
people, our natural allies. In that situation of universal oppression and enmity, Bonaparte did tvv^ice squander away the moral 
and military resources of this nation, first in Russia, afterward, 
at Dresden, and Leipsic, and brought in the hosts of the coalition, leaving on the Niemen, the Oder, and the Elbe, the material means of defense which he had taken from our stores and 
fortresses. He capitulated for himself, while a restoration ushered by the Allies, and not unpleasing to the nation, Avas generally considered as a tolerable transaction between old princes 
and modern institutions. A month had sufficed to prepare 
the people for a change. It was impossible for any combination, 
but the folly of the royal Government, to make Bonaparte 
welcome, which proved to be the case with many, although 
few could love and trust him. But these interior vicissitudes 
were of no etfect upon foreign courts and foreign nations. The 
latter, having no time to explain, were hurried again against 
their own interest, with revengeful and desperate fury. The 
courts were the more eager to avail themselves of their error, as 
they saw that Napoleon, unable to reassume his arbitrary doctrines, had been forced to acknowledge the first principles of the Revolution. 
</p><p>
Two modes of resistance were left for France, to launch out 
of the imperial circle of men and measures into a national insurrection : or to support the actual ruler who, although he was a 
check upon the exertions of a people whom he did no more 
trust than he could be trusted by them, was justly reckoned the 
ablest of generals, and enjoyed the confidence of a standing 
army amounting to two hundred thousand men. The active 
majority having prefered this method, it remained for those who 
would have proposed a bolder and more popular system, to slide 
in with the adopted plan of defense, which vras done with candor and determination. 
</p><p>
Two weeks after the opening of the session, Napoleon had 
lost the only army that bore a proportion with the opposed 
forces, and leaving it to its fate, he flew back to the national 
representation, not to consult, but to dissolve it, recurring to a 
wild and desperate arbitrariness which, while it countenanced 
the attack, could not but damp and dishearten the defense. He 
was checked in the attempt, and with the assent of his best 
friends, obliged to abdicate. 
</p><p>
Time was short. An attempt to raise some sort of pudeur in 
the Allies, and construe their word of honor into a suspension 
of arms proved fruitless. In the mean while the troops being 
rallied under the walls of the capital, more divested of Bonapartism, more actuated by patriotism than they had been said to 
be, were all alive to national colors and national independence. 
On my return from the diplomatic errand which I could not refuse, I was much disappointed to hear of the capitulation. The 
provisory Government and peers dissolved themselves. The 
House of Representatives were dissolved by force, but not before they had, in their declaration of the 5th of July, expressed 
what I think to have been for five-and-twenty years the true 
sense of the nation. 
</p><p>
Further resistance to foreign powers was impeded. The 
President of the popular Government was a minister of the King 
before he had entered Paris. The imperial system of administration having been, during thirteen years, calculated for absolute 
monarchy had precluded the means of exertion. A Royal Government being reinstalled in the capital, many trusted its influence with the Allies, those who did not were afraid the impend 
</p><p>
ing evils should be imputed to their obstinacy. And above all, 
the high powers, made a more Machiavelian use of the King's 
name and hand successively to undo all the means of French 
resistance, after which you know what treaty has been dictated 
by them. 
</p><p>
Two administrations have been tried. That of Talleyrand and 
Fouche, although the former had solicited and signed the coalition of Vienna, and the second put his name to the proscription 
of many of his associates and friends, and to the suppression of 
the liberty of the press, was not thought a match for the royalism of the two new chambers. The present ministry, the head 
of which, although for twenty-five years a Russian officer, is a 
Frenchman by birth, the last of the illustrious family of Richelieu, and among whom our friend Barbi Marbois is seal-keeper, 
have gone great lengths toward the spirit of reaction. You have 
in the papers the bills proposed by them, and their speeches in 
both Houses, which, nevertheless, keep ahead of the Executive. 
Among the influencing powers you may distinguish a British 
and a Russian interest, to both of which I am, thank God, a 
perfect stranger. 
</p><p>
Unfit as I shall ever be for such complicated politics, and having, in my doctrines of legitimacy, much to say for the rights 
of men and the sovereignty of nations, I am returned to my 
retirement of Lagrange, and my agricultural pursuits. Here my 
son, his wife, two daughters, and eleven grandchildren, are now 
with me. We expect in a few days the pleasure to receive General Scott and Major Mercer. 
</p><p>
The happy tidings we receive of increasing prosperity in the 
United States, fill my heart with delight. I hope the work of 
liberty and independence in the other parts of America, is going 
on, and am I to be discouraged with respect to the final establishment of freedom in the European world ? The liberal part of 
the Revolution shall not be lost. 
</p><p>
You have been pleased, my dear sir, to promise your kind 
inquiries and good care with respect to my Orleans business. 
The Pointe Coupee lands have been purchased by Sir John Coghill, Mr. Seymour, and the parish. The two former gentlemen 
complain that M. Duplansier, by refusing to answer some questions relative to a land tax, has exposed their property to be sold. They were ignorant of the duty. I hastened to write to 
the President and explain their situation. 
</p><p>
There remain five hundred and twenty acres to be located, or 
I rather think, located in the vicinity of the town. Under the 
pressure of my affairs I have parted with one half of those town 
lots to Sir John, whose large capital, being employed on his 
alternate lots, would soon bring my share to a value much superior to the actual totality. Should the location be at a distance 
of more than two miles, the space between the bayou and the 
town, it becomes a common tract and the whole would have 
been paid above its value. In the contrary case, one half is 
mine. It is true. Sir John might challenge me to take back 
this half for the given price and interest. But if the location 
was made on the spot, I would, I think, easily find a capitalist 
to take Sir John's bargain. Let me add that he is willing, in 
case there was not room for a location of five hundred and twenty acres, to enter into some aiTangements with the claimants, to 
make it complete. Such is, my dear sir, as far as I know it, 
the present state of the affair. M. Duplansier, who has been 
very unfortunate in his own concerns, has not, for several years, 
written to me. M. Allen Michel had the powers of Sir John 
who has since, I believe, sent a relation of his. The President, 
to whose kind concern in my behalf, I am highly obliged, knows 
probably more of my affairs than myself. 
</p><p>
This letter will be delivered by Mr. Lakanal, member of the 
French Institute of the Academy, and Rector General of the Medical System with a handsome treatment, all which he abandons 
for a settlement in the neighborhood of Lexington, State of 
Kentucky. The high rank he holds in the scientific world, and 
his having been a distinguished member of our former assemblies will recommend him to your notice. But I have presumed 
to engage in your name you Avould favor him with your good 
advice, and with letters of introduction to the country which 
he intends to inhabit. I know you will be so kind as to render 
him in that way, the services which I beg leave to solicit on 
account of his own merit and my earnest desire to oblige him. 
Permit me to depend upon you to ask the same favor from our 
friends, Mr. Monroe, and Crawford, and others who may recommend him to public and private characters in the State.

My DEAR Sir, - Permit me to entreat yom* kind welcome and 
good advice in behalf of M. Pette and M. Menardi, who are going 
to settle in the State of Ohio. Their partner, M, La Barthe, 
is already fixed near New Athens, and there enjoys the freedom 
which old Athens now struggles to obtain. Our cause has been 
unfortunate in Italy, but can not fail ultimately to prevail. European liberty chiefly depends on the interior politics of France. 
I hope our American newspapers take their paragraphs from the 
" Constitutionnel," the '' Courier," or at least the semi-oflicial 
"Moniteur," in what relates to the debates of the Chamber of 
Deputies ; all the other journals make it a point to disfigure them 
scandalously. Where M. Pette and M. Menardi will find you I 
do not know, but am sure you will have the goodness to give 
them all the advice and recommendation in your power.

My DEAR Sir, - I am too happy in an opportunity to keep our 
friendly acquaintance, and would be still happier to converse 
with you on the business of freedom, as it relates to both sides 
</p><p>
of the Atlantic. You have had the pleasure, in which I was long 
ago ready to sympathize, of the acknowledgment of Columbian 
independence by the United States. May every part of that 
continent be also free, independent, and universally acknowledged ! It is to be expected the nonsense of an American emperor can not last long. Bat while I rejoice in the emancipation 
of what was called the Spanish dominion, while I lament the 
hesitation of the Cortes in the acknowledgment which policy and 
necessity point out to them, I would be very sorry to hear of a 
serious quarrel between Spain and the United States. The embers of European freedom are now to be cherished in the peninsula. Old Governments, England particularly,, employ a great 
deal of cunning in fomenting divisions among the nations, and 
in every nation among the parties, nay, the individuals who enlist in the cause of mankind. Their friendship is almost as bad 
as their enmity. The British papers, Whig and Tory, seem to 
vie in recommending an intervention, under the form of protection, in the affairs of this very Greece against whom Great Britain and Austria have acted so cruel and dishonorable a part. 
How happy should I be to see an American squadron in those 
seas ! The American flag should be the natural, disinterested 
protector for the Grecian confederacy. Should the Ottoman 
navy prove impertinent, it might be crushed at once. A Grecian 
citizen who has left Corinth with orders from the Federal Government, tells me that two millions of dollars, two ships of the 
line, or three or four large frigates, could they obtain that sum 
and naval means from mercantile enterprise, would suffice to insure the liberties of that classic country. It is to be feared the 
assistance will be either withheld or lent with interested views, 
if not under degrading conditions. The decisions of the Vienna 
Congress are every day expected. While a common antipathy 
to the rights of men and nations link them together, the old systems and potent views of each Cabinet interfere with the general 
plan of the Holy Alliance. The situation of France under its 
counter-revolutionary Government is better understood by a 
series of intelligences lately collected from the papers of both 
parties, than I could explain in a letter. An actual invasion of 
Spain by foreign troops may be postponed from the fear of uniting the whole people in the defense of the country ; but every 
countenance and protection will more and more be afforded to 
the enemies of the Constitution ; and if the patriots are driven to excesses, in consequence of their provoked irritation it will 
become a pretense against them, against the liberals of every 
country, and the cause itself, much depends on the spirited resistance of Spain in the present crisis. 
</p><p>
I have been requested by my former aid-de-camp in the national guards, and constant friend, M. de la Rue, to mention to 
you a claim of his lady, Beaumarchais' daughter, now under the 
examination of Congress. Their wish is that the affair may be 
referred to a judicial, I suppose the Supreme Court. It does not 
belong to me to decide on the propriety of the measure, nor the 
circumstances of the claim, further than to say, I have been a witness to very active exertions of Beaumarchais in the first period of 
our American contest ; but I owe it to those remembrances, and to 
my affection for M. de la Rue, to make to you the mention of this 
affair, very important to him and family. It appears that American claims upon France are on the point of being examined in 
this country. I much wish justice may be rendered on all sides. 
</p><p>
I have often the pleasure to talk of you with two amiable 
friends of ours. Miller and Wright, who are now in France, and 
most of the time in our family colony of Lagrange.

My dear Sir, - I have been applied to by the amiable Madame 
de la Rue for a letter of introduction to my friend Mr. Clay ; 
she is daughter of the celebrated Beaumarchais, whose name 
has been connected with the five years of our American contest ; 
she is the wife of one of my faithful and zealous aides-de-camp 
in the National Guard ; two motives which make it a very agreeable duty for me to present her to you. 
</p><p>
Madame de la Rue has a claim upon the public treasury, long 
debated in Congress, the documents o'f which have been laid before you. It does not belong to me to anticipate your opinion 
in a matter upon which you have more data than I "could oiler ; 
but I find a pleasure in contributing to gratify Madame de la 
Rue's wishes to be introduced to your personal acquaintance.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - I am the more anxiously waiting for the 
packet of the 1st instant, as an account of your having been sick, 
since my departure, has appeared in the French papers. Yet 
there are evident inaccui'acies in the report. Now I must hasten 
these lines to the Cadmus, which sails on the 1st November. I 
have written to the President, sending him an article of the Journal des Dehats, which may interest him and you. I also tell 
him a few words of what I have heard respecting the affairs of 
Greece, upon which I have seen nothing to alter my opinion. 
I came directly from Havre to Lagrange, and have been very 
friendly received by the people on the road, and here, on my 
arrival. Ministerial and court people have either kept aloof, or 
acted foolishly to their own damage. I have been only four 
days in Paris, to see several friends, and do not intend returning 
to town before the first days of January. The mass of the nation is quiet and industrious, though dissatisfied with the measures 
of the Government, and the incroachments of nobles and priests. 
I found Mr. Brown much better than I expected, indeed, almost 
quite well. Mr. Sheldon is better, also, and has wisely, I think, 
determined to nurse his health in Paris, rather than go to ennuyer 
himself in the South, while his time here is usefully employed. 
Mr. Somerville has been very sick ; I hope he will be soon on 
his travels. Present my afiectionate respects to Mrs. Clay and 
family. Receive those of my children and Le Valleur.

LAGaANGE, November 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>. 
</p><p>
My i>ear Friend, - This letter will find you in the full occupation of Congressional business, and although your duties as 
Speaker are over, there will be enough for the Secretary of State 
to do. I am ever anxiously waiting for news froru the United 
</p><p>
States, and particularly from Washington. My American habits 
have been so happily renewed in the blessed thirteen months I 
have passed on your side of the Atlantic, that I can not easily 
submit to an inteiTuption in these communications. Let me 
hear from you as often as you can. 
</p><p>
You have but too melancholy motives to sympathize with 
the cruel anxiety I have had lately to experience ; one of my 
granddaughters, the third daughter of George, has been on the 
eve of death. She is now out of danger. How often and how 
feelingly I have thought of you and Mrs. Clay you will easily 
conceive. I was gone to town, and expected to see Mr. Brown 
the next morning when a courier, announcing the dear girl's 
situation, recalled me suddenly to Lagrange. I suppose he has 
more than me to write about European politics. Indeed the 
politics of the Republican hemisphere, until this is greatly 
mended, appear to me the principal business of mankind, 
</p><p>
I much wish to know what answer you have had to your 
South American and Mexican communications respecting the 
Congress of Panama, and who has been sent as minister from 
the United States to that momentous meeting where his good 
and honest advice will, no doubt, prove highly useful. They 
say the Empire of Brazil has been invited also to send a minister 
to Panama. I wish it might be to give Don Pedro a passport 
to Europe ; for I apprehend this Brazilian spot will be a focus 
of European intrigues until it has adopted the Republican form 
of Government. 
</p><p>
While British publications speak of their half recognition of 
American independence, as if no such feat of liberalism had ever 
existed elsewhere, the French Government are wavering between a sense of public discontent at their backwardness and 
their ridiculous notions of legitimacy ; and when lately they 
thought of grasping at something like a mezzo termine on the 
part of Spain, they have been momentarily discomfited by a 
change in the Spanish ministry. Such is the diplomacy of Europe, and the fitness to have an American era of foreign as well 
as interior policy. However, an invisible current must soon 
wash away those difficulties. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the quarreling spirit of the Grecian chiefs, 
and abuses attending a long interruption of national Government, there is an admirable heroism in the resistance of that people and a moral obligation to every liberal man, or body of men, to give them encouragement and the assistance which special 
situations can allow. The British Government is, as usual, under a conflict of interests opposed to each other, and wants to 
obtain, as cheap as possible, the first place in the poor career of 
European liberalism. While French committees are sincere and 
eager iii their concern for the cause of Greece, the Tuileries 
holds a connection, most unpopular in France, with the Egyptian despot. The rumor of very peculiar acts of benevolence 
from the American squadron and Commodore Rogers in behalf 
of the Greeks, which has produced no party complaint that I 
know of, has in the enlightened and liberal part of the world 
added to the popularity and dignity of the American name. 
What has really passed I do not know, but very much lament the 
illness of Mr. Somerville which possibly keeps him in Paris. I 
have pressed him to come to Lagrange to refit himself, and from 
there pursue his journey ; but when he will be able to support 
this short ride to our country residence I can not yet say. He 
is, however, a little better, as he himself writes to me, and you 
will no doubt get from him a later and more positive account. 
Present my aifectionate respects to Mrs. Clay, to the President, to 
your colleagues, and all other friends in Washington as well as to 
their families. George and Le Yalleur beg to be respectfully remembered. Be so kind as to forward the inclosed letters ; and 
remember me to your own family, present and absent, and believe me forever your sincere friend. 
</p><p>
I have received, before I left the United States, communications from my old comrades of the Connecticut and Massachusetts lines, intimating the purpose to presgit Congress, during 
this session, with a petition relative to the manner in which old 
accounts have been settled in their very interesting claims on 
their country's bounty, and also respecting the interpretation 
given in 1820, to the pension law of 1798. At all times I would 
have taken the most lively interest in their behalf, but now 
loaded as I am with the munificent bounty of Congress, I am 
more than ever anxious to hear they have had cause to be satisfied. There are few survivors ; any thing done for them would, 
I hope, be gratifying to the people, and you know it would have 
an excellent effect abroad. 
</p><p>
Mr. Connel returns to England by way of Liverpool. He 
will talk with you of several claims upon Europe, namely, that 
of Antwerp which he had been commissioned to pursue. I have 
</p><p>
seen M. and Mme. De la Rue. They know you are of opinion 
that Congress might with all propriety, and without hurting any 
person, instead of taking it for granted that the President is enlisted to introduce this French claim in the negotiation, express 
a positive vote upon it, and indeed I don't see any objection to 
express what every one considers as being already understood. 
</p><p>
Here is a bundle of letters which, with proper confidence in 
your goodness, I beg you to forward.

</p><p>
Although no direct information from you, my dear friend, has 
confirmed the fatal report communicated to me for the first time 
by Mr. Brown and your sister, I but too well know I have again 
to sympathize with you in a most heavy calamity. I have also 
to mourn for myself. It was impossible to have formed an acquaintance with the most valuable daughter you have lately lost, 
to have been favored with her friendly welcome and affectionate 
attentions, without feeling a deep and lively personal regret. I 
condole most tenderly and mournfully with you, my dear friend, 
with Mrs. Clay, and the whole family so cruelly visited of late, 
and want words to express what I feel on the lamentable occasion. 
</p><p>
A similar kind of misfortune has been very near attending me. 
My granddaughter, Clementine, the youngest daughter of George, 
has passed several days in a hopeless state ; she is now recovering. I was then thinking of a former, although a late loss. Far 
was I from suspecting what new blow had fallen upon you, 
</p><p>
I have no heart to talk with you of other matters. The 
President will receive a letter from me. My son and Le Valleur 
share in my sad feelings, and beg to be remembered most affectionately. 
</p><p>
I have written to the President that Mr. Somerville expected 
to proceed slowly toward his destination. Mr. Brown, whom I 
have just now seen, gives me a much more sad account than what 
I had received from poor Somerville himself.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - No letter from you, since your last most lamentable loss, and you can not write to a more sympathizing 
friend, has yet reached me ; but I have heard of you and Mrs. 
Clay by your sister and Mr. Brown. We have been here on the 
edge of a similar affliction, and I am sure you will feel with me 
at the not-expected recovery of my granddaughter. Poor Somerville, after a long and painful lingering, has breathed his last 
at Auxerre, on his way to Italy ; he hoped, while the physicians 
had no hope of him. Mr. Brown will inform you of the measures taken to secure his papers. He has expressed the affectionate wish to be buried at Lagrange, which was received with 
our best gratitude and respect, and, after consulting the pubHc 
officers of the United States in Paris, executed in the properest 
manner we could, ignorant as we were of Somerville's religious 
persuasion. It was thought the parish cemetery, where two of 
my grandchildren are interred, was the proper spot, and I am 
taking measures, by an exchange, to annex it to the grounds of 
the farm. You easily will guess what title I would like to mention 
in the inscription. Bat it can not properly be done until you find 
no inconvenience in it. I have every day lamented an unavoidable delay. Every circumstance confirms me in that opinion. 
</p><p>
Although the interior politics of Russia have been kept in the 
dark, two points seem to be ascertained : that Nicholas is the 
definitive Emperor, and that a plan to obtain constitutional guaranties had a great share in the late commotion at Petersburg. 
The Holy Alliance has received a blow. It is said another disappointment awaits them from the bad health of Emperor Francis, whose son, more of a fool than his father, which amounts to 
complete idiotism, is pretended to hate Metternich, the great 
counter-revolutionary intriguer. I believe the bad situation of 
the Greeks has been exaggerated, even by well-meaning persons. 
There is in the revolutionary spirit of freedom an elasticity which 
is seldom well appreciated. On no European power they can 
confide. But posterity, and it will begin immediately after their 
success as it would begin immediately after their fall, can not 
fail to give full credit to every honest measure taken in their behalf. I am very anxious to hear the name, or names, of the mission to Panama, and have with much pleasure heard of a Republican success over the imperial troops of Brazil. I more and 
more am confirmed in my eagerness to see the monarch of Brazil 
removed from his American throne. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear friend. My best respects wait on Mrs. Clay 
and family.

Paris, February 28, 182G. 
</p><p>
My deak Sir, - Your letter of the 13th December is the las* 
I have received from you. I know your avocations, but when 
ever you have time to drop a few lines, they will be received 
with the grateful feelings of patriotic interest and personal friendship. 
</p><p>
My hopes of Greece have not been disappointed. They still 
fight, and often conquer, abandoned as they have been by all, 
and attacked or betrayed by many of the Christian powers. It 
seems now that England regrets not to have been more generous 
</p><p>
before an unforeseen and extensive conspiracy in Russia may 
make it a matter of necessity for Emperor Nicholas to wage war 
against the Turks. The Western powers would like to patch 
up some arrangement favorable to the independence of Greece, 
that they may not be dependent on the Russian empire. I wrote 
to you some private exertions were taking place, from only one 
part of the French Greek Committee, in favor of Duke d'Orleans' 
second son. Now the Duke himself does not deny it, but 1 
doubt his obtaining a sincere support from the Court of the 
Tuileries. Under those circumstances I did more lament the 
misfortune that has deprived' poor Somerville of the pursuit 
of his mission, and I wish a respectable American squadron may 
appear again in those seas. My notions of the moral influence 
of the people of the United States are lofty and extensive, I confess ; but at least I would sadly regret if it were not fully exercised at the Congress of Panama, and in every concern of South 
America, it would be, in my opinion, leaving the field to the 
intrigues of European monarchy and aristocracy. Nor can I be 
easy until the throne of Brazil is no more. 
</p><p>
Present my afiectionate respects to Mrs. Clay and family, to 
the President and family, to yom- colleagues in the cabinet, to 
all friends. Receive those of my son and Le Valleur, and believe me forever your affectionate sympathizing friend.

My dear Sir, - We are anxiously waiting for the arrival of two 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> packets. I hope they will bring me some lines from 
you. At all events I will know what is going on at Washington and other parts of the United States, a food to my mind, a 
consolation of my heart, which has become more than ever 
necessary to me. I am happy to think the Panama mission is 
now on its way. I believe it of high moment for the welfare 
of South America and Mexico, for the prospects of mankind, and 
for the dignity of the people of the United States, that they 
preserve and exert the moral influence to which they are so 
justly entitled. 
</p><p>
This letter accompanies an ofl'er presented to you of the collection of General Foy's speeches, which have the additional 
merit of being a compliment of the national subscription in behalf of his children. The conduct of the people in that circumstance has been marked with feeling and propriety. The editors 
"are men of remarkable talents. 
</p><p>
The European newspapers, your correspondence with the 
American ministers, leave me but little to say on political topics. 
I am by this same opportunity writing to the President, and 
think it needless to repeat my observations. Present my best 
respects to Mrs. Clay and family, remember me to our friends, 
and receive the sincere wishes, in which my companions heartily 
join, of your affectionate friend.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, - I have not by the last packet heard from 
you, or the President, or any of ^Jie pubhc men at Washington, 
which I readily explain on account of your pressing avocations 
in these Congressional times. Mr. Brown writes, no doubt, to 
you. Mr. Dodge, consul at Marseilles, contemplates going from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> to the seat of Government, which is a very good 
channel of late information. I shall therefore confine myself to 
expressing my satisfaction at the result of a debate which has 
given me much anxiety, as you know nobody sets a greater 
value than I do on the moral influence of the United States, for 
their own sakes, for the sake of the new American Republics, 
for the sake of mankind, the general cause of which, the Government model, whenever they allow themselves to act, is called 
to further. I wish the commissioners may not have been too 
long detained. 
</p><p>
My anticipations relative to the heroic resistance of the Greeks, 
have not been disappointed, but unless European policy, I mean 
that of their Governments, finds a selfish interest in rescuing 
them from the efforts of the barbarians, nothing is to be expected 
from the feelings of the Holy Alliance, Great Britain included. 
In the meanwhile, we have the joyful account of a complete 
repulse of Ibrahim Pasha, from the shattered walls of Missolonghi. 
</p><p>
Present my most affectionate respects to Mrs. Clay, to the 
President, and both families, to your colleagues, to all friends at 
Washington. I have had a visit of the gout, which had very 
properly refrained from interrupting my enjoyments on the 
sacred beloved ground of the United States, but am now much 
better.

Lagrange, May 28, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1826">1826</a>. 
</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, - My affection and regard for you are sure, and, 
I hope, anticipated pledges of the interest I take in every thing 
where you are concerned, and it were superfluous to expand on 
my feelings, which, I know, are not to you a matter of doubt. 
</p><p>
Your official correspondent and good brother gives you regular 
accounts of political matters on this side of the Atlantic. I have 
already communicated my private observations on the strange and' 
portentful contrast that exists between the liberal sentiments, the 
improving good sense of the people on this continent, more particularly in France, and the bold, but, I expect, imprudent encroachments of power and priesthood on the actual state of 
civilization. This anomaly is very striking in the dispositions 
relative to Greece. It appears that Great Britain and their continental partners have succeeded in tampering with the co-religionary movement of the Russians. The British commander of 
the Ionian Islands has boldly invited the heroic population of 
Missolonghi to surrender to the Turks, which amounts to the 
massacre of every man, the rape of every woman, and the conversion to Mohammedanism, if not the death, of every child, prisoners of war in their hands, while a scanty supply to the starving garrison, or at least the starving women and children, was so 
very easy a matter. On the other hand, renegade officers, protected by the French Government, have assisted in reducing that 
unfortunate population who have resolved to blow up, along with 
their enemies, such part of themselves as could not fight, and 
devote the other to destruction, among the havoc they made in 
the barbarian ranks of the Austrians. I shall only say that nothing 
can exceed or equal the infamy of their conduct. In the meanwhile, the popular feeling in favor of the Grecian cause has never 
been so warm and so general. Their adversaries are branded 
with the most poignant reproaches. Collections are going on, 
supplies are sent. The people of France, the ladies of Paris, 
and successively of every town, are acting a conspicuous and useful part in their behalf. I see in an English paper that some 
stipulations have been made at Petersburg in favor of Greece. 
But although public opinion is much excited, I question even this 
dilatory interference. I need not tell you, my dear friend, that I 
have been anxiously waiting for the arrival of the two private 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> frigates, and persisting in the opinion that the presence of an American squadron on those seas would afford honorable opportunities, consisting with the rules of neutrality, to 
render essential services. And, indeed, such I have found the 
popular feeling in the United States. Such is now the general 
feeling in Europe, that every service rendered to those people 
would be looked upon with very favorable constructions. 
</p><p>
I see in the papers that a Penitentiary is to be erected in the 
District of Columbia, under the control of the President ; and I 
remember with pleasure the conformity of our ideas respecting 
the deviations from the late system of reformation, and namely 
the prevalence of solitary confinement that was contemplated at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. Not that I object to solitary cells, not only as a 
transitory punishment, but also as a great improvement to separate the prisoners at night, a time when they spoil each other. I 
only think that in day-time they ought to be together in a certain number, which is susceptible of very useful modifications. I 
intrude upon this matter because I believe this is a good opportunity for the United States to give one more example, among so 
many, to the rest of mankind. 
</p><p>
Permit me to put under your cover a letter to Mr. Skinner, 
inclosing one to Mr. Cormick and the Report of the Agricultural 
Society of Paris, with their very advantageous opinion about a 
new plow which I had been desired to present to their examination. Here is also a letter to my Memphis friends. 
</p><p>
Present my best respects to Mrs. Clay and family, to the President and family, to your colleagues and other friends in Washington. I have been long suffering from the gout, and depend 
on the country air and country occupations to make me quite 
well. Part of my family are still in town, namely my daughterin-law, who is one of the female collectors for the Greeks,

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - Mr. Brown who is in the city, Mr. Gallatin, 
whom I had the pleasure to see for two days, give you French 
and English news, with the reports from other parts of Europe. 
I have therefore very little to say, and what should I say but 
that the British and the Continental Cabinets are patching up 
every gap from which liberty and equality might pop out on this 
side of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the public mind is making 
slow progress, and at the end of a chapter, too long I fear, things 
will definitely come to rights. 
</p><p>
I have given the President an account of my conversation, 
sought on their part with the last commissioners, from Hayti to 
this Government, the main point of which was to tell me that 
one of the American objections to the acknowledgment of their 
independence, might easily be removed, as they might even now 
assure you that the privileges complained of as a kind of vassalage, were not, at any rate, to last more than the time fixed for 
the payment of the stipulated money. 
</p><p>
Permit me to inclose a letter to the President, containing the 
application of a lady, a packet for Mr. Graham, relating to my 
landed concerns, and one to my dear friends Fanny and Camilla 
Wright, the elder of whom had but lately recovered from a very 
alarming fever. I would much like to have your opinion of 
their philanthropic experiment. 
</p><p>
I beg you to present my best respects to Mrs. Clay and family, 
to remember me to our friends, particularly Governor Barbour, 
to whom I will have the pleasure to w^rite by the next packet. 
Here is the copy of a letter I have received from General Bolivar. 
It has been published in France, as well as my letter from 
Washington, at the request of M. Madrid, the Colombian agent 
to this Government.

Lagrange, December 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1826">1826</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, - After having passed a very pleasing summer 
m this rural abode, we have been lately afflicted with a sad 
calamity, the death of Louis Lasteyrie (husband to my daughter 
Virginia, and father to four children), whom we have lost after 
a cruel illness of two months. You are but too Avell acquainted 
with the feelings of family mournings, and will sympathize 
in our regrets. The so very strange murder of Doctor Brown 
has given me much pain, not only from motives of friendship 
to his brother and other relations, but on account of my personal 
acquaintance with him and his amiable family. 
</p><p>
You are now in the midst of Congressional debates. I much 
wish they may relax of the unusual bitterness that has marked 
the last session. The choice of Mr. Poinsett to the Congress 
of Panama has afforded me great pleasure, as he well knows the 
concerns of South America and Mexico, including those of Guatimala, and will be a good adviser of the Republican measures, 
as well as a guardian against European influence. How do you 
find Mr. Canning's assertion in the British Parliament that he, 
Mr. Canning, has called to existence the new Republics of the 
American hemisphere ? when it is known by what example, 
what declaration, and what feelings of jealousy the British Government has been dragged into a slow, gradual, and conditional 
recognition of that independence. 
</p><p>
Gallant Greece is still struggling against the Ottomans and 
Egyptians ; whatever has been the revolutionary tone of the 
British prime-minister, and in spite of the counter-revolutionary 
ultraism in France and Spain, it is well understood between all 
Governments in Europe, that a general commotion might carry 
them on a ground not very favorable to the interests of aristocracy and despotism ; so that as long as they can keep the nations 
within the bounds of ancient institutions, or at best, of old and 
new octroyed charters, they will ever ultimately find means to 
patch up every political question that may annoy European 
slumbers. 
</p><p>
Among the several publications relative to Lagrange and its 
inhabitants, which I have found in the papers of the United 
Slates, there is one that I am prompted to notice, as you will 
have, at Washington, frequent opportunities to contradict it. 
 
</p><p>
The writer, with a kind intention, I don't doubt, but under a 
complete mistake, asserts that I am assailed by Americans in 
Europe, with demands for money. Happy I would be, to be 
sure, of an opportunity to oblige friends in distress. But those 
opportunities have not been offered. 
</p><p>
Be pleased, my dear friend, to present me very affectionately 
to IVIrs. Clay, your family, the President, Mrs. Adams and family, 
your colleagues in the cabinet. General Brown, Commodore Morris, General Bernard, Mr. Graham, and all other friends at Washington. Be pleased also to take care of the inclosed letter, and 
believe me forever your affectionate friend.

My dear Friend, - Your kind congratulations and affectionate

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, - Having accidentally missed the last opportunity 
to answer your most valued favor, August 10th, I avail myself 
of the next packet to oifer my affectionate thanks, and request, 
as much as the pressure of business allows it, the very high gratification of your correspondence. 
</p><p>
Your diplomatic accounts from Europe have little to say, and 
although a member of that House, by courtesy, called Representative, I am not the wiser, nor shall I be the more useful for it. 
A dissolution of the House is much spoken of. The ministry are 
recording the new electoral lists, in consequence of a late bill 
mingling the vote of election with the duties of juror, to which, 
however, some additions have been made. As the public mind 
is progressing, and several willful errors have been forcibly rectified, a liberal opposition can not fail to be more numerous. The 
question with Government is, whether they will this year meet 
a larger minority, with a seven years' new lease, or hereafter risk 
to have a majority against them, or at least a stronger opposition 
than that to which, in case of dissolution, they must. now submit. 
</p><p>
The account of the funeral of Manuel having been indicted 
before an inferior tribunal, and our speeches on his tomb making 
a part of the impeachment of the publishers, it became the duty 
of Messrs. Lafitte, Dechiness, and myself, to claim our share in 
the trial, which we could not obtain. But a judgment of the 
 
</p><p>
court, very properly and liberally worded, has acquitted the selected objects of the accusation. An appeal from that decision 
to the Superior Court, has, it is said, taken place. 
</p><p>
The intervention of three great powers in the affairs of Greece 
seems to promise a respite, although it has not prevented the arrival of an Egyptian fleet, and a body of soldiers. There is, 
however, some good in the notifications made by the French 
and English admirals, impeding further progress. The mediation 
has been accepted by the Greeks. The Ottoman Porte hitherto 
refuses it. So far they oblige the mediators to commit themselves a little more, and, if they are sincere, the Porte must yield 
at last. It is obvious to every looker-on that those powers are 
jealous of liberty, of complete emancipation, and jealous of each 
other. If any body can play the difficult game, it must be Capodistria, who is now on his third station, that of Paris, before he 
proceeds to the Presidential chair. He unites in his person an 
exclusive coincidence of happy circumstances. After he has 
managed those discordant elements, there will be other discordances to be managed at home, for which he also seems to be the 
proper and exclusive man. Upon the whole, the existence of 
Greece is rather more secure than it has been of late. 
</p><p>
I have received a letter from our friend Poinsett, and can not 
but observe with him the general and especial attempts that have 
been lately directed against the peace, harmony, and institutions 
of the Republican States of South America and Mexico. It is 
very natural to see the Republican minister of North America a 
butt to those monarchical and aristocratical factions. That the 
impression is given from Europe is not, I think, to be questioned. 
But I have received with deep regret the part of your letter alluding to a man whose glory, great talents, and hitherto experienced patriotism I have delighted to cherish. Several painful 
informations had reached me, which, all together, and many 
more beside, could not weigh so much with me as your own 
sense of the matter. I beg you to continue to write on the subject, and on every matter relative to public concerns, to my 
friends, and particularly to yourself, who know my old, grateful, 
and sincere affection. 
</p><p>
Blessed as I have lately been with the welcome, and conscious, 
as it is my happy lot to be, of the affection and confidence of all 
parties, and all men in every party within the United States, 
feelings which I most cordially reciprocate, I ever have thought 
myself bound to avoid taking any part in local or personal divisions. Indeed, if I thought that, in these matters, my influence 
could be of any avail, it should be solely exerted to deprecate, 
not, by far, the free, Republican, and full discussion of principles 
and candidates ; but those invidious slanders which, although 
they are happily repelled by the good sense, the candor, and, in 
domestic instances, by the delicacy of the American people, tend 
to give abroad incorrect and disparaging impressions. Yet that 
line of conduct, from which I must not deviate, except in imminent cases now out of the question, does not imply a forgetfulness of facts, nor a refusal to state them occasionally. My remembrance concurs with your own on this point, that in the 
latter end of December, either before or after my visit to 
Annapolis, you being out of the Presidential candidature, and, 
after having expressed my above-mentioned motives of forbearance, I, by way of a confidential exception, allowed myself to 
put a simple unqualified question respecting your electioneering 
guests, and your intended vote. Your answer was, that in your 
opinion, the actual state of the health of Mr. Crawford had limited the contest to a choice between Mr. Adams and General 
Jackson, that a claim founded on military achievements did not 
meet your preference, and that you had concluded to vote for 
Mr. Adams. Such was, if not the literal wording, at least 
the precise sense of a conversation which it would have been inconsistent for me to carry further and not to keep a secret, while 
a recollection of it, to assist your memory, I should not now deny, either to you, as my friend, or to any man in a similar situation. 
</p><p>
Present my affectionate respects to Mrs. Clay. Remember me to all your family, and to our friends in Washington. I will write by the same packet to the President.

Lagrange, October 28, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1828">1828</a>.
 
My dear Sir, - The critical time of Presidential election is 
now come ; the busy time of the session is coming on ; yet I 
know you ever have a thought to spare for your affectionate 
friend on this side of the Atlantic, Mr. Brown, whose excellent lady, to our inexpressible gratification, is now in much better health, keeps you mformed of European political news. The 
Russians have met with more difficulties than was expected. 
It is said that mistrusts relative '.o the suppressed conspiracy have somewhat added to them. Mahmond is a spirited sultan. 
Yet at the long run the power of .Russia is considered to have 
the better chance, unless the influence of England and Austria 
succeed in patching up a peace during the winter. Amid these 
broils and intrigues, France is acting a noble part quite the 
reverse of the Spanish Expedition, a contrast which has been 
observed by Ibrahim Pacha himself in his conversation with 
the French Generals. The session will not open until the 20th 
of January. Some particular points we wish to obtain have 
been stated in a public dinner at Meaux, an account of which I 
inclose. There are some others that will be mentioned ; but 
while the present ministry are less advanced in their own liberalism than we wish them to be, they find at court a heavy drawback in their endeavors to move on the popular road. Some 
progress, however, is made. 
</p><p>
Mr. Cooper is now on his travels ; his late publication will 
give to European readers more correct notions of the United 
States than are found in most books on that matter, and yet I 
hear it is criticised in America as being too complimentary to 
his own countrymen. I don't find it is so, and while foolish 
slander is propagated in almost every British publication, don't 
think that feeling, or rather profession of humility, to be seasonable. 
</p><p>
I understand Mr. Cooper has resigned his Consulship of Lyons. 
The emoluments of the station do not allow a special mission 
from the United States. I am told applications have been made 
in favor of my friend Mr. Bradford, a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>er, nephew to 
Mr. Philip Hone, late mayor of that city, and I hope I don't 
break upon my determination, not to solicit preferments, when I 
tell you that Mr. Bradford, whose intimacy with us has given 
me full scope to know him well, is one of the best, most sensible, and noble-minded young gentlemen I ever met in my life. 
He is universally beloved. 
</p><p>
Be pleased, my dear sir, to remember me very respectfully 
and affectionately to Mrs. Clay and family.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, - A precious book, beautifully bound, and containing several of your admirable speeches, has been lately presented to me, by your excellent brother, Mr. Brown, as a new 
token of your friendship. That it has been received with every 
sentiment of affection and gratitude I need not, I know, to assert, but I want to express, and so I want to add that while I 
am happy to acknowledge your personal kindness along with 
your public eloquence, there is one speech, strongly tinctured 
with both, which although not recorded in the book, as it relates 
to a more private object, shall ever be engraved in my heart. 
</p><p>
Four days are now elapsed, my dear friend, since you have 
been restored to a life of repose ; it will probably not last long, 
and I anticipate the approaching time v/hen you will be returned 
to Congress, and probably to the Chair of the House. I hope 
the intervals will be consecrated to the restoration of your health, 
above which, and also above every thing that concerns yourself 
and family, I beg you to give me frequent and minute information. They become the more necessary to me as we are going 
to lose Mr. and Mrs. Brown, a loss that is deeply felt by every 
American on this side of the Atlantic, by none m_ore than by 
rae, and my family who are attached to them by every tie of 
gratitude, afl'ection, and respect. Mrs. Brown's health is now 
better than when they took the resolution to return home. We 
have been much alarmed on her account ; it is now over, as to 
danger, and a few days ago she looked quite well. But all the 
particulars relative to her health she, no doubt, gives to her sister, and these lines will go by the same opportunity. Packets now run three times in the month. Miss Brown, who lives with 
them, is a most amiable young lady. 
</p><p>
Of the affairs of Europe you have, in your official capacity, 
heard a great deal, and much of them is to be found in the public papers. It appears the two great despots of the East will try 
the fortune of war. The conduct of the French Government 
has been liberal and disinterested. Not so with the rulers of 
England ; they strive to contract the limits and independence of 
Greece. Their connections with Don Miguel, and late behavior 
at Terceira, have roused a general cry against them. The American stars have lately lighted on a dextrous and honorable private attempt, of which I feel very proud. Austria is as bad as 
ever. Italy deserves the leaden inquisitorial yoke. It is impossible for Spain and Portugal to go on as they are now governed. 
The downfall of the Villele administration, and a better choice 
of deputies which occasioned it, has set the interior affairs of 
France on a somewhat improved line of march. But very slow, 
timid steps indeed. Far even from what could be done within 
the so very limited circle of an octroid charter. Yet, I think it 
a duty to assist in the little progressive good that can be obtained. 
</p><p>
On reading again your observations on our Colonization Society, of which to have been chosen a Vice-President is to me 
a great honor, and a most highly valued gratification, I have 
thought you will employ some of your time of leisure in promoting the most important object that it remains, in my opinion, 
for our part of America finally to obtain. The settlement of 
Liberia may in future times civilize Africa, and facilitate a gradual abolition of slavery. I have seen with much pleasure that 
measures of the kind were talked of for the District of Columbia. You know that while I feel, as much as any man, the 
cursed evil entailed upon America by Great Britain, I am not 
insensible of the immense difficulties, but think that if an incessant attention, in the Southern States, to that momentous object 
of self-interest as well as of humanity, is directed that way, 
means may be found out consistent with prudence and possession, to limit, lessen, and perhaps, in time to eradicate that only 
obstacle to Southern improvements, that only objection to the 
example proposed to the world in the superior state of American civilization. 
</p><p>
I am told our friend Mr. Adams intends to remain with his family in the District of Columbia ; if you see them, and your 
former colleagues in the Cabinet, remember me very affectionately to them all. Present my best respects to Mrs. Clay and family. 
</p><p>
My son requests me to present his best respects. Le Yalleur is now a partner in a bookselling firm under the name of Malker & Co., Faubourg, St. Germain, where he has settled his family and himself. You know that M. David, one of the first statuaries in the world, and the first in Paris, member of the Institute, etc., has presented Congress with a marble bust, made on purpose to be offered as a tribute to them. It has been much admired by the artists of Paris.
