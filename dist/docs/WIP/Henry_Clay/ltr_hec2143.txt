My dear Sir, In respect to the Vice-Presidency, I wrote you 
some days ago. When my name was brought forward seriously, 
I resolved neither to offer nor to accept any arrangement in regard to myself, or to office for others. I have adhered to that 
resolution hitherto, and shall continue to abide by it to the last. 
I Considered that I was and ought to be in the hands of the 
public, to be disposed of as it pleased. Most undoubtedly the 
office of Vice-President is one of high respectability and great 
dignity, preferable, in my opinion, to any place in the cabinet. 
If the acceptance of it were offered to me (I mean by the public 
having the right to tender it), I could not decline it ; but I can 
not seek it, much less make any sacrifices of honor or duty to 
obtain it.
