THEODORE WYTHE CLAY TO HIS FATHER. 

Lexington, November 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>. 

My dear Father, - I received yours with great concern for 
the deep distress in which our great loss [death of Eliza and 
Mrs. Duralde] must have thrown both yourself and my mother. 
I have not the power of deriving any consolation to myself, 
and have not, therefore, the means of offering you any. I 
would gladly render you happy by any sacrifice in my power. 

As I advance in years I feel the value of a relation more and 
more, because they must and should be the best friends, I 
hope, however, that you may not suffer your spirits to be too 
much depressed, for it is an inevitable effect that the health is 
thereby impaired ; and that of yourself and my dear mother, by 
these repeated shocks, is more and more necessary to our happiness. 

* Theodore Wytbe Clay, the oldest son, has now (1855) been in the Lunatic 
Asyluro, at Lexington, over twenty years.

THOMAS H. CLAY TO JAMES B. CLAY. 

Washington, May 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1852">1852</a>. 

Dear Jamt:s, - Summoned by a telegraphic dispatch of the 
27th ultimo, I arrived here on Tuesday evening last, the 5th 
instant. For forty-eight hours after my arrival, my father appeared better than he had been for a week previous. He is 
very feeble, and there is no longer any hope of his reaching 
Kentucky alive. 

Dr. Jackson thinks that there may be a termination of his 
case in a few hours, and it may be possible that he may live a 
week or ten days longer. He is greatly reduced in flesh ; the 
same cough yet continues to harass and weaken him, and he is 
noAV unable even to walk across the room. Yesterday evening, 
supported by a friend on each side, he was very near fainting. 
He has now to be carried from his bed to his couch. He can 
not talk five minutes in the course of the day without great 
exhaustion. 

He has directed me to say in answer to your letter of the 24th 
ultimo, that he is too weak to attend to the matter you write of 
with Corcoran and Riggs. 

He is calm and composed, and will meet the enemy without 
any fears of the result. The Sacrament was administered to 
him yesterday, by Mr. Butler, the Episcopalian chaplain of the 
Senate. Give my love to your wife and children.

THOMAS H. CLAY TO HIS WIFE. 

Washington, May 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1852">1852</a>. 

My dear Mary, - Had you seen, as I have, the evidences of 
attachment and interest displayed by my father's friends for him, 
you could not well help exclaiming, as he has frequently done, 

*' Was there ever man had such friends !" The first and best in 
the land are daily and hourly offering tokens of their love and 
esteem for him.

MR. THOMAS H. CLAY TO HIS WIFE. 

City of Washington, June 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1852">1852</a>. 

My DEAR Mary, - Shortly after I wrote to you this morning, 1 
was summoned by James to my father's bedside. " Sit near 
me, my dear son," he said ; " I do not wish you to leave me for 
any time to-day." In about an hour after, he said, " Give n\e 
some water." I gave him about half a glassful, which he drank, 
and still retained the tube in his mouth. In a few moments he 
released the tube, and said, " I believe, my son, I am going." 
Five minutes after, he told me " to button his shirt collar," which 
I did. He then caught my hand, and retained it in his pressure 
for some time. When he relinquished it, I discovered he was 
dying. I summoned Governor Jones, of Tennessee, who occupied the room above him, and in five or ten minutes after he had 
ceased to breathe. 

May my mother, and all of you, be prepared for it. A nation 
mourns, but it is his gain. He is free from pain, and I thank 
God. Oh ! how sickening is the splendid pageantry I have to 
go through from this to Lexington. 

My love to all. 

My father died at seventeen minutes past eleven. I telegraphed Mr. Harrison at twelve m.
