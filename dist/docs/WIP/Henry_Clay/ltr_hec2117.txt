 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, July 27,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1810">1810</a>.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Dr. Beatty</a>, I received your favor of the 24th June. The nett yield of our merino (owing to the neglect or fraud of the 
shearer of him) was not sufficient to make me a coat. Mrs. 
Clay therefore determined to have it spun, and either applied to 
other uses, or retained until we could get an additional quantity. 
A Captain M'Call, in this neighborhood, has undertaken to weave 
and full, for Jordan, some yarn spun from the merino wool ; and 
if you can not better dispose of yours, I have no doubt Mr. 
Jordan can procure him to weave and full yours also. 
</p><p>
I learned with pleasure your decision in favor of again offering 
for the Legislature. Your success, I am told, is not doubted. 
The Republican interests will require, and, I am sure, will receive your best support. Whether the Federalists will or will 
not attempt a Senator of their own kind depends on the issue of 
the election. I believe Daviess will not be elected here ; and 
even Humphrey dreads the result of the Franklin election. 
</p><p>
P. S. I requested a Mr. Fowke, of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, to call on you for professional aid, which I hope you will afford.
