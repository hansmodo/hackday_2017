My dear Sir, I duly received your obliging letter of the 18th 
instant. I am glad to hear of the probability of the recovery of 
Colonel Taylor's health. With respect to his opinions on the 
subject to which you refer, whatever they may be, they can not 
diminish that habitual veneration for him which I have ever 
cherished.

On the point of a caucus, in a spirit of perfect desperation, a 
continual effort is making to get one up. It will be defeated, 
you may rely, either by being voted down, in a general attendance of the Republican members, or by a resolution of a large 
majority of them not to attend. If they make one, it will be a 
faction â€” a cabal. My friends say, that on the score of mere expediency, they have no objection to a caucus which shall be 
composed of the Republican members generally ; that they have no 
fears of the result of such a caucus ; but that they have no idea 
of consenting to make part of a caucus in which they should act 
the part of mevefguranti, which would be the case if the friends 
of other candidates, who, it is well known, would not attend, 
should be absent. ******

With great regard, I am faithfully your friend.
