My dear Sir, You will have seen that the Supreme Court 
has decided against the validity of our occupying claimant laws. 
The dissatisfaction which will be felt by the people of Kentucky, with the decision, will be aggravated in no little degree, 
by the fact, that the decision is that of three judges to one, a minority, therefore, of the whole court ; and this aggravation will 
be further increased by considerations which belong to either of 
these three judges. 
</p><p>
At the moment of some vexation about this unhappy result of a 
cause, the effects and possible consequences of which, fill me with extreme concern, I wrote you my last letter, and I fear that 
I expressed myself in it, on some points, in a manner which I 
ought not to have done, even to one whom I have ever regarded 
as one of my best friends. I must pray you, therefore, to commit it to the flames, and its contents to oblivion. * * * 
</p><p>
I shall leave this place in a few days, for Kentucky, by the way 
of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and I shall be glad to have the pleasure of 
hearing from you, when I reach home.
