I received, my dear sir, your very obliging letter of the 14th 
instant, and I pray you to believe that I do not place less value 
on your friendship because you have nothing to communicate 
"more favorable to my prospects." On the subject to which you allude, I assure you most sincerely I look with great calmness, 
and with a most perfect determination to acquiesce cheerfully in 
whatever choice the nation may make. It would be a poor compliment to our institutions, to say that their solidity, or the public 
happiness, materially depended upon any election that shall 
take place. I really think, however, that Virginia can not justify herself to the Union for the apathy which you say prevails 
there on the question. Judging, as I have done at this distance, 
from the " Enquirer" and other Virginia prints, I had supposed 
that great interest was felt and generally taken in its decision, 
and that there was even danger of her overstepping the line of 
cautious circumspection, which her leading politicians were understood to have marked out for her. 
</p><p>
This indifference, you say, arises from the absence of any 
pledge that the great interests of the people of Virginia will be 
taken care of by any of the competitors for the chief magistracy. 
If, indeed, no such pledge is to be found in the principles, integrity, and characters, as heretofore developed, of either of the 
candidates, it is, I should think, quite too late in the day now 
for any pledge to be given or received. But, my dear sir, what 
interests have Virginia and the South separate from the Union? 
You have mentioned a single subject only, that of the encroachments of the Federal judiciary on State rights ; and, as connected 
with this, the broad doctrine now inculcated, that Congress has 
the right to extend, not to regulate only, the jurisdiction of the 
Federal Courts." On that subject I am entirely at a loss to conceive any peculiar interest in the State of Virginia, and the 
Southern States. All are equally concerned in the jurisdiction 
of the State sovereignties. All would be equally affected by 
Federal usurpation. But I must confess that it is the first time 
that I ever heard asserted such a doctrine as you say is now inculcated. The limit of the Federal judiciary is to be found in 
the Constitution, and Congress can vest in it no power which is 
not there found. If such a doctrine as you state is really attempted to be inculcated, you will find Kentucky now, as in the 
epoch of 1799, in spite of all your unkindness toward her, ready 
to co-operate with you in opposing it, and no man in the Union 
will be more prompt than I shall be to second the opposition. 
I can not suppose you to refer to the power that is claimed for 
the general Government, to give effect to its laws through its own 
judiciary. For, without that power, without Federal means to effectuate the constitutional resolves of the Federal will, there is 
an end to the general Government — that is inevitable, if not instantaneous anarchy. 
</p><p>
But, my dear sir, on this subject of the Federal judiciary and 
State rights, I mean to say a few words to you, in the spirit of 
Virginia independence, and in the frankness of sincere friendship. 
Has not Virginia exposed herself to the imputation of selfishness, 
by the course of her conduct, or of that of many of her politicians? 
When, in the case of Cohans and Virginia, her authority was 
alone concerned, she made the most strenuous efforts against the 
exercise of power by the Supreme Court. But when the thunders of that Court were directed against poor Kentucky, in vain 
did she invoke Virginian aid. The Supreme Court, it was imagined, would decide on the side of supposed interests of Virginia. It has so decided ; and, in effect, cripples the sovereign 
power of the State of Kentucky more than any other measure 
ever affected the independence of any State in this Union, and 
not a Virginia voice is heard against the decision. The Supreme 
Court is viewed with complacency, and as a very different sort 
of tribunal from that Supreme Court which decided Cohans' 
case. 
</p><p>
Again : of all the irregular bodies, none can be more so than 
a Congressional caucus at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. None have a more consolidating tendency. Indeed, it is espoused upon the principle 
of preventing the exercise of State or Federal rights through the 
medium of the House of Representatives. Yet the Virginia 
politicians (at least if we are to judge from the papers) warmly 
advocate the constitution of such a caucus. Will it not be said 
that they are influenced by the consideration, not of preserving 
unimpaired State rights, but of giving to the State power of 
Virginia the utmost effect of which it is capable? Or that of 
securing the election of the alleged favorite, who, without the 
instrumentality of such an assemblage, is in danger of losing the 
election? It is in vain to speak of the inconveniences of a 
warmly-contested election. They are incident to our system, 
and are happily provided for by it. And the transitions from a 
Congressional caucus to a pretorian cohort or hereditary monarchy, to escape from those vexations, are not so great as we 
might at first imagine. 
</p><p>
I am aware that on two subjects I have the misfortune to 
differ with many of my Virginia friends — internal improvements and home manufactures. My opinion has been formed after 
much deliberation, and my best judgment yet tells me that I am 
right. I have not time, nor would it be fitting as regards your 
comfort, now to discuss the policy or the power of fostering these 
interests. I believe Virginia and the Southern States as much 
interested, directly or indirectly, as any other parts of the Unior, 
in their encouragement. When the Government was first adopted 
we had no interior. Our population was inclosed between the 
sea and the mountains which run parallel to it. Since then the 
west part of your State, the western parts of New York and 
Pennsylvania, and all the Western States, have been settled. 
The wars of Europe consumed all the surplus produce on both 
sides of the mountains. Those wars have terminated, and emigration has ceased. We find ourselves annually in possession of 
an immense surplus. There is no market for it abroad ; there is 
none at home. If there were a foreign market, before we, in the 
interior, could reach it, the intervening population would have supplied it. There can be no foreign market adequate to the consumption of the vast and growing surplus of the produce of our 
agriculture. We must, then, have a home market. Some of us 
must cultivate ; some fabricate. And we must have reasonable 
protection against the machinations of foreign powers. On the 
sea-board you want a navy, fortifications, protection, foreign 
commerce. In the interior we want internal improvements, 
home manufactures. You have what you want, and object to 
our getting what we want. Should not the interests of both 
parties be provided for? 
</p><p>
It has appeared to me, in the administration of the general 
Government, to be a just principle to inquire what great interests 
belong to each section of our country, and to promote those interests, as far as practicable, consistently with the Constitution, 
having always an eye to the welfare of the whole. Assuming 
this principle, does any one doubt that if New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and the Western States 
constituted an independent nation, it would immediately protect 
the important interests in question? And is it not to be feared 
that, if protection is not to be found for vital interests, from the 
existing systems, in great parts of the confederacy, those parts 
will ultimately seek to establish a system that will afford the 
requisite protection? I would not, in the application of the principle indicated, give to the peculiar interests of great sections all the protection which they would probably receive if those sections constituted separate and independent States. I would, 
however, extend some protection, and measure it by balancing 
the countervailing interests, if there be such, in other quarters of 
the Union. 
</p><p>
I concur entirely with you in thinking that the north and 
east, but particularly New England, have laid, in a great measure, the other parts of the Union under contribution. And of 
all the ill-advised measures, of all the wasteful expenditures of 
public money, the Revolutionary pension list pre-eminently takes 
the lead. Never was there more public money spent, with less 
practical benefit. But who proposed it? Your own <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="">Monroe</a>. 
I thought of it then as I think of it now ; but opposition would 
have been silly and vain. 
</p><p>
You will oppose my election, I suppose, in Virginia. I have 
no right to complain. Silence and submission are my duty. You 
will oppose me because I think that the interests of all parts of 
the Union should be taken care of ; in other words, that the interests of the interior, on the two subjects mentioned, as well as 
that of the maritime coast, ought to be provided for. You will 
give your suffrages to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> ; and if Mr. Crawford or Mr. Adams be elected, I venture to predict that we 
shall find, either in his inaugural speech, or in the first message 
or speech (perhaps the latter mode of communication may be revived) to Congress, a recommendation of efficient encouragement 
to domestic manufactures and internal improvements. 
</p><p>
I am afraid that you will think me in a very bad humor. Far 
from it. I repeat that I never enjoyed more perfect composure. 
My health, it is true, is extremely bad, and I am now confined 
at home by the endeavor to re-establish it. But it neither affects 
my tranquillity or gives me the spleen. In regard to the election, 
as to which I will make no professions of affecting an indifference, which I do not feel, my friends continue to be very confident ;. and my own opinion is that my prospects are not surpassed by those of either of the other gentlemen, still I am not 
unaware that all things are uncertain ; and I therefore continue 
resolved to preserve my philosophy, my principles, and my conscience, be the event what it may. 
</p><p>
Has not our friend Southard been rapidly advanced? He 
certainly has merit, and his friend, the Secretary of War, has 
discernment. 
 
</p><p>
It would have given me great pleasure to see you, as it will 
to meet you any where again. Can you not run up to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> next winter? To a close observer there will be a scene 
there exhibited worth surveying. Wherever you are, I pray you 
to be persuaded that my best wishes attend you. 
</p><p>
P. S. I send you my elusions as they are poured out through 
a mercurial course, on which the doctors have put me ; and wish 
no copy for others. I write for yourself alone.
