My dear Sir, I received your letters of the 6th and 8th inst. 
In the former was inclosed a ten dollar note, about which not 
one word was contained in your letters. Was it inclosed by 
mistake? or did you intend that I should apply it to some object 
for you? Be pleased to instruct me.

The " long agony" was terminated yesterday, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> 
was elected on the first ballot. Exertions to defeat, and even to 
defer the result, of the most strenuous kind, were made up to the 
last moment. Without referring to the issue of the election, the 
manner in which the whole scene was exhibited in the House 
of Representatives was creditable to our institutions and to our 
country.

I have not yet received the " Enquirer," in which my letter 
has been published. It did not arrive to-day.
