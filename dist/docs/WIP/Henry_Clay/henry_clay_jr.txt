HENRY CLAY JR. TO HIS FATHER. 

West Point, March 2*7, 1827. 

Dear Father, - Since I last heard from you, Mr. and Mrs. 
Smith, with Margaret Ross, have been here. They remained 
but a day or two, and seemed delighted with the place. From 
them I learned that you were well, and that Theodore is going 
as a bearer of dispatches to the Congress of Panama, likewise, 
that it is your intention to visit Kentucky some time in May, 
but they do not inform me whether my mother goes with you 
or not. Should you come to the determination of leaving 
Washington, I should be extremely happy to see you here. 
The lakes will then be open, and will afford you a speedy and 
pleasant route. Worthihgton will be very little out of your 
way, and by calling, you will gratify James. * * *

HENKY CLAY JR. TO HIS FATHER. 

West Point, June 24, ISST. 

Dear Father, - I arrived here last Thursday, the 21st, and 
have already been examined, and, I am glad to add, have been 
admitted. Yesterday we came into camp, and I am now in my 
tent, sitting on my knapsack and writing on my chair. I am 
better pleased than ever with the Academy. I was well received 
by the officers on my return, and now start with the prospect of 
success hereafter - am delighted with the hardships accompanying a military life, but still give the civil the preference. My 
duties will prevent my writing more, although I had intended 
to have written a long letter concerning the discipline and course 
of study in use here. Give my respects to all my relations and 
friends. Tell Cousin Nannette that I am daily expecting an 
answer to my letter which was written before I left Washington.

West Point, December 16, 1828. 

My dear Father, - When last in Washington, I mentioned 

to my mother that it would be in my power to be absent from 

West Point during the two months of the next encampment ; 

and intimated that it would be highly agreeable to me to visit 
Kentucky. My feelings on this subject still remain the same, 
but I must confess that 1 am not very eager to go, all things being 
considered. For if I am to remain in the army, it will be of the 
last importance to me to enter as honorable a corps as possible, 
and this may, in some measure, be influenced by my going, for 
it is but reasonable to suppose that my mind will be somewhat 
estranged from study. You will perceive that I am beginning 
to lose all other ambition than that of being an honest man. A 
professorship of mathematics in some college, or, lastly, a post in 
the army, are all that I now aspire to. My talents, I am forced to 
coincide with you in what I have long supposed to be your 
opinion, are not above mediocrity. This presents to me an insurmountable obstacle to the profession of law ; for in this profession there is no medium. A good lawyer and a great man, a 
poor lawyer and a contemptible man, are synonymous terms.

West Point, January 21, 1829. 

My dear Father, - I have received your letter of the 14th 
instant. By it all my fears are quieted ; and I can now look forward to something honorable. You can hardly conceive of a 
more wretched state than that in which I was before this letter 
was received. I have always had an inclination for the law, 
which arose from an entire conviction that it was the path which 
led to distinction. When, therefore, it was first proposed to me 
to come to West Point, I thought that I saw all my hopes blasted 
forever, and, though I desired to acquire the education given 
here, yet I must confess to you that I looked upon my stay at 
this place with a kind of horror. But now that I see that your 
intentions have all along been in unison with my wishes, I feel 
sensibly how much I have erred in the supposition, too hastily 
formed, that you purposed that I should become a member of the 
army. Feeling as I now do, I can not but beseech you to forgive me for the uneasiness which my but half-suppressed discontent must have caused you.

HENRY CLAY, JR., TO HIS FATHER. 

West Point, May 19, 1829. 

My dear Father, - You caution me against remitting my efforts in my present pursuits, in my eagerness to enter upon the 
study of the law. I hope, and at present feel confident, that I 
shall preserve my rank in my class. The course of studies of 
his year is by no means so difficult as that of the last, or of 
the coming year. I now find time to attend to some studies 
which I believe will be useful to me when I commence the study 
of law. I am reading Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws. I take 
much interest in it. The subjects treated of are such as would 
present themselves continually to a man's mind in our country 
of laws and of free inquiry. The style of the work is very dif
ferent from the general style of the French, for it is both concise 
and comprehensive. 

I shall be with you by the 1st of July. Remember me to 
our friends. 

P. S. - I would be glad if you would send me an application 
by you for a furlough for me. I believe I have not mentioned 
this to you before, although it ought to have been done, for by 
a regulation of the Academy, it is required that the application 
of the parent or guardian should be handed in, together with 
that of the cadets, on the 1st of June.

HENRY CLAY, JR., TO HIS FATHER. 

West Point, September 18, 1829. 

My DEAR Father, - I received your favor of the 3d instant. 
I am glad to be able to write, in answer to a portion of it, that 
I am not only satisfied about West Point, but, in fact, am so 
well persuaded that advantages closely connected with my future welfare may result from the continuation of mjr academic 
course, that nothing would now induce me to leave this place. 
My dear father, your kindness and indulgence have convinced 
me that I have greatly erred, and that I can not too soon ask 
your forgiveness of my offense. When I wished to act in direct opposition to your decided advice, by not returning to 
West Point, my unwillingness to return did not arise from any 
obstinacy of opinion as to the utility of the course of this school, 
but merely from a sanguineness of success which so often leads 
young men to suppose that they are as competent to contend 
against the difficulties of the law, at eighteen years of age, as 
they will be at any future time. However, all this has passed 
by, and I am now completely submissive. You tell me that you 
wish me to receive your opinions, not as commands, but as advice. Yet I must consider them as commands, doubly binding, 
for they proceed from one so vastly my superior in all respects, 
and to whom I am under such great obligations, that the mere 
intimation of an opinion will be sufficient to govern my conduct.

Camp Eaton, July 4, 1830. 

My dear Father, - The anniversary of the Declaration of 
Independence was celebrated here on yesterday. From peculiar 
considerations I again appeared before an audience of between 
four and five hundred, and was once more eminently successful. 
At the dinner given by the corps, at which about one hundred 
invited guests were present, the wit and eloquence of the sons 
of Kentucky were toasted with applause. But the toast of IVIr. 
Skinner, the editor of " The American Farmer and Turf Register," " The orator of the day, in the language of the turf, blood 
will show itself," drew forth enthusiastic cheers. Do not accuse me, my father, of too broad an exhibition of vanity. I confess that I, in common with all my fellow-men, am subjected to 
that besetting sin of the human race. But I have thought that, 
to you, a candid expression of my sentiments would be far more 
acceptable than any affected air of indifference that I might force 
from my self-love.

HENRY CLAY, JR., TO HIS FATHER. 

West Point, December 20, 1830. 

My dear Father, - I have just learned vv^ith certainty by 
your letter, that you and my mother are going to New Orleans. 
You will find there such a reunion of friends and relations, 
that I am sure you can not fail to spend a very agreeable winter. Would that I formed one of your party, but next to enjoying your society myself, is the pleasure I feel in knowing that 
you are re-established in health and spirits, and surrounded by 
your friends. 

In regard to study, an object has presented itself to my view, 
and I eagerly pursue it. My perseverance and assiduity in this 
pursuit, may perhaps be to my prejudice in others, but still I am 
willing to give up excellence in every other department of 
knowledge, to attain an honorable rank as a speaker. I am 
well aware that a general acquaintance with the whole circle 
of arts and sciences, and in fact with every branch of human 
knowledge, is indispensable to the accomplished orator, and this 
I shall endeavor to acquire, without weakening or confusing my 
mind by too abstracted an attention to minutiae. I am glad that 
you are improving Ashland. I have a kind of filial affection for 
it, which seems to increase with my years, and distance from it.

West Point, June 21, 1831. 

Dear Father, - I have favorable news to give you in regard 
to myself. I have finished my examination and have graduated 
second ; and in the engineer corps. You know that it is the 
highest honor conferred upon graduates to be admitted into the 
engineers ; and one not often conferred upon the heads of classes. 

General Scott is President of the Board for this year ; you 
know he is your warm friend, and consequently mine. I have 
received from him many manifestations of the kindest attention 
to my interests. He wishes me to be stationed in New York, 
should I remain in the army. If you should advise me so to 
do, I shall be employed on the fortifications of New York Bay 
and Harbor. In the mean time I deem it proper to say that my 
talents remain the same as before this honor, and I believe I may 
say my inclinations also.

HENRY CLAY, JR., TO HIS FATHER. 

New Orleans, February 28, 1832. 

Dear Father, - I am now living at Judge Porter's, on the 
coast. I found that in the city I was so much interrupted by 
the kindness of friends and acquaintance, that I could not devote that time to study which I desired. At the solicitation of 
the Judge, I therefore determined to spend in the country the 
few months that I shall be in Louisiana. 

Judge Porter's residence, as you will recollect, is near the 
battle-ground, three or four miles from the city. He has an excellent library, and is himself a learned man in the law, animated with the best spirit of learning, that which applies useful 
maxims to the common wants of mankind. 

The civil law begins to open before me. What I thought the 
study of a year, I perceive now would exhaust the energies of 
a lifetime. But I am determined, if ever I shall arrive at an independence of fortune, to caiTy what little talents and attainments I may possess to another tribunal than the bar of justice, 
the tribunal of public debate. 

I am at present making all exertions to gain a knowledge of 
the law, and I have no reason, I think, to be dissatisfied with 
my progress. By the winter after next, I shall be able to come 
to the bar with a fair prospect of ultimate success.

HENRY CLAY, JR., TO HIS FATHER. 

Ashland, April 24, 1832. 

I wish to communicate the joyful intelligence that you are 
grandfather by a new title. Heaven, as if jealous of our fondness for Anne, has attempted to divide it by a new object of affection, but it will only give rise to a new source of feeling. 
Yesterday, between 2 and 3 p. m,, Anne gave life and light to a fine daughter. 
 
We shall be happy to introduce you when you come, to the youthful stranger. Mary is to be her name, and her aunt, Miss 
Mary Erwin, her godmother. 

I am now, for the first time for many years, enjoying the 
pleasures and scenes of a youthful spring in Kentucky. It is a 
charming country, and Ashland and the Woodlands have a thousand interests for me. I do not at all envy you your heated political atmosphere at Washington. I much prefer the serene 
happiness which the perusal of the elegant Thompson infuses, 
while surrounded with the beauties which the season of bloom 
opens to the view. 

When may we expect you ? My mother, I suppose, will not 
precede you. I hope to show her when she comes, that Ashland 
has not fallen into bad hands. A little severity, which I used in 
the fir t place, and a continued exertion of energy, have introduced a system and regularity into the concerns of the place, which were much wanting when I came.

HENRY CLAY, JR., TO HIS FATHER. 

Louisville, November 2*7, 1832. 

My DEAR Father, - In regard to myself I am now perfectly 
happy. I am united to a lady who possesses my entire love and 
veneration, and who returns me, in over-measure, the affection 
to which I am entitled. We are not rich, but it will be a source 
of pleasurable occupation to become so. Like all young men of 
ambition and aspiring temperaments, the mere possibility of ill 
success keeps alive in me a thousand unnecessary and annoying 
fears. But I hope ere long to become settled in life, and then I 
shall begin in good earnest to mold my future destinies. In the 
meantime, I shall devote my principal energies to the law, and 
shall endeavor to compose my mind to a state of profitable study. 

Whatever, my dear father, may have been my errors, I haye 
always entertained for you the most unvarying filial attachment; 
and it shall always be my highest pleasure to endeavor to meet 
your wishes and commands. 

Julia desires me to express her love to you all in the most 
tender and affectionate terms.

New Orleans, March 11, 1833. 

Dear Father, - This morning I stood my examination in open 
court before the Judge of the Supreme Court, and I intend immediately to commence the practice. My visit to Mobile and my 
examination and license there were entirely unnecessary. I was 
admitted to an examination on the plea of residentship. I am 
full of hope and energy, and loving the civil law as I do, I indulge 
a subdued confidence of ultimate success. At all events, I shall 
continue the trial for two seasons after the present.

HENRY CLAY, JR., TO HIS FATHER. 

Maplewood, December 14, 1833. 

My dear Father, - I must now write you upon a very painful subject. Anne, Mr. Erwin, and the rest of the family, with 
the exception of myself, determined, from the great and apparent 
increase of Theodore's malady, and from the positive risk and 
danger of his going at large, that he ought to be again placed 
in the Hospital in this place. The Commissioners have taken 
him once more under their protection. They applied to me to 
know if I consented to it. I told them that I should have nothing to do in the matter, but that as one nearly related, but without any authority or desire to act, I had no objection. When 
he was placed in the Hospital I was applied to as his brother^ 
the nearest relation present, to advance $50 for his board, and to 
give my bond for $500. I advanced the money promptly, and 
have expressed my willingness to give my bond. This is my 
part in the affair. I am not the mover in the business, nor, I 
may say, a participant, for Anne selected her course without 
consulting with me. She placed him where he is. But now 
let me say, my dear father, without I beseech ^''our having my 
motives impugned, that Anne has done right. Theodore endangered the lives of all in the house with him. He was worse 
than he ever had been. But he is now doing better. To look 
at him was enough to melt the heart. His health wasting away, 
his face pale and emaciated. The day exhausted in forming 
suspicions of plots and conspiracies, the night in ceaseless and 
terrible alarms. Let me say, with a full knowledge of what I 
owe to you and to my mother, that we should allow the best 
physicians to operate with this most subtle and distressing disorder. When he was in the Hospital before, his health was reestablished and his mind certainly improved. Let us then curb 
our feelings and not destroy our brother and our child by mistimed affection. If the malady is a great affliction to us all, and 
the most awful calamity to which a human being is subject, then 
let the remedies be applied with proportionate care. Let the 
wisest men and the most skillful in cures take our patient under 
their charge. I have every hope, and others entertain hope 
also that Theodore will be eventually cured, if left in the Hospital. His disorder, from being confined to a few subjects has, 
I think, become more general, and 1 hope unsettled. At all 
events we ought never to resign hope ; and the experience of 
mankind informs us that the living and discipline of a Hospital 
are the best remedies for the disease. Is the discipline, even 
when the worst, as painful as the amputation of a limb, and 
shall we do less to preserve our mind than our body ? But you 
know the truth of what I write and my mother too will adopt 
it, I hope ; for I think if she will reflect upon Theodore's case, 
she will recognize the exact coincidence with it of what I write. 
Theodore is now doing well, and I, at least, feel much better 
satisfied with what is going on for his good than when he was 
at large, a source of mortification and affliction to you and his 
friends, and in a progress to the gradual but complete destruction 
of his mind, his health, and happiness.

BoRBEAUX, September 17, 1835.
 
Dear Father, - I send to-day by the ship Tuskina, the Spanish ass Don Manuel. Mr. Haggerty in New York will have 
him put upon grass until he can hear from you. I have written 
to him to draw upon you for the expenses of transportation. 
The captain carries him for $50, I finding every thing. The 
captain's bill, and the charges in New York and on the way 
to Kentucky, will be all that are to be paid. May I beg that 
you will meet this bill, and that you will write to James Haggerty of New York, whom you know, such directions as will 
be proper. The ass has been rode and he is as gentle as a dog, 
so that a small boy might ride him. He is a very fine ass, about 
thirteen and a half hands and half an inch or one inch high. 
I am induced to send him because the Tuskina is a large packet 
and the only fine one in port. I shall go in a few days to the 
Hautes Pyrenees department where I hope to procm-e some good 
Spanish asses. There is a mistake about them in America. 
The few I have seen are very handsome.

HENRY CLAY JR. TO HIS BROTHER JAMES. 

Louisville, May 25, 1846. 

Dear James, - Your letter was thankfully received. The 
Governor left here yesterday morning. The night before I offered him five companies, and a sixth reported themselves through their officers the same night. I could easily raise the ten. Indeed I have been much complimented by offers to serve with me. When I offered the Governor the companies he told me that he would not be bound by their election, after having given me reason to believe that he would issue the commissions according to their choice. 

At present, having done all that a proper sense of duty requires, in having offered my services, I have determined to do nothing more. The rest remains with his Excellency. 

Tell Henry Erwin if he desires to go out I would advise him to be elected, if possible, captain or lieutenant of one of the companies. My love to Susan and all our friends.
