My dear Sir, During your sojourn at home, I did not write 
you any letter except one, which I addressed to you some days 
ago, at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, with a direction to the post-master at that 
place, to forward it to you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, if you had gone 
thither. I hope it has safely come to hand. I am glad that you have returned to the metropolis. Inclosed, I transmit to you 
two letters which I have received to-day from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, which 
you may return or destroy, after perusing the contents. Other 
letters, to other persons, have, from Albany, corroborated their 
statements, and represent, first that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> can not possibly obtain the vote of New York ; secondly, that great dissatisfaction prevails at Albany, with such a caucus as was held 
here, and especially with the person nominated as Vice-President; and thirdly, that there is no contest in New York, but between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and me. Pennsylvania has gone inevitably to Jackson.
