 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, December 30,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1801">1801</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, I have received as well your letter by Mr. H. Taylor, as the one written a few days after, by the post. 
</p><p>
I must request the favor of you to execute a small commission 
for me. The Acts of the Virginia Legislature, passed prior to 
the separation of this State, are extremely difficult to be procured, 
even by collecting fugitive Acts, in this country ; but few indeed 
of the public offices possess entire collections. Yf ill you be so 
obliging as to obtain for me, if you can, the old revisal, which 
reaches, I believe, to the year 1766, the Chancellor revisal, and 
the Acts passed since that, in a regular series to the year 1792. 
The last is most desired, but I could wish to possess all. Your 
revisal of 1791 would not answer my purpose, because it contains laws not in force in this country, and, if my recollection 
serves me, omits to give the respective dates of the passages of 
each law, all-important in many cases. These books you will 
be pleased to forward to William Taylor, Esq., merchant, in 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, from whom I can easily procure them ; or to either 
of our representatives in Congress, Mr. Brown, Mr. Breckenridge, 
Fowler, or Davis, who will contrive some mode for them to get 
to me. I suppose they may be obtained from the Council Chamber. 
</p><p>
What has become of the son of my much regretted friend, 
your brother? I feel myself under obligations of gratitude to 
the father, which I should be happy of having an opportunity of 
discharging to the son. What is the progress he has made in 
his education? We have in this place an university in a very 
flourishing condition. Could you not spare him to me in this 
country for two or three years? I live at a short distance from 
the buildings, have a small family, and need not add, that from 
the cheapness of living in this country, his expense to me would 
be extremely inconsiderable. We have, too, a distant hope of 
getting <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison</a>, from William and Mary, to take the management of our seminary. Be pleased to let me hear from you on this subject.

</p><p>
Sir, Yours of the 15th instant, addressed to me at the Olympian Springs, did not reach me until a few days ago at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, or 
it should have been earlier answered. 
</p><p>
I recollect, during the session of the Assembly of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1803">1803</a>, having 
had one or more conversations with you relative to the amendment of the Federal Constitution, providing for a deb;^,'Tntion of 
the President and Vice-President in the votes to be given for 
those officers. But I regret that my memory does not enable me 
to detail the particulars of those conversations. I remember, 
however, that you expressed doubts as to the propriety of the 
proposed amendment, urged some arguments to prove that the 
existing provision was best, and suggested your fears that a 
change would produce mischievous consequences. Whether 
your opinion was matured or not I can not say, but I do not 
think you expressed one decisively. If the name of General 
Pinckney was mentioned, and how or by whom it was introduced, at the times of the conversations, or at any of them, it 
has escaped my memory. I have heard you speak of that gentleman, I think, more than once, in terms of high respect, and 
it may have been when the topic of conversation was the amendment ; but I do not believe that you drew any parallel between 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> and him, or contended that he was equally well 
qualified to fill the presidential chair. 
</p><p>
When I saw the handbill to which you allude, I was surprised 
at some of the sentiments there ascribed to you ; and am inclined 
to think had they been avowed in my presence and hearing, that 
they would have made an impression which would be still fresh.

</p><p>
City of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, February 15, 18O7. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, I received your agreeable favor, with its inclosure, 
for which accept my thanks. Your New Year's ode was well 
adapted to the object in view, and the perusal of it afforded me 
much pleasure. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> has supplied much fund of conversation. No 
doubt is now entertained here of his having engaged in schemes 
of the most daring and illegal kind. Having left Kentucky under a 
belief that he was innocent, it was with no little surprise upon 
my arrival here that I found I had been deceived. Entertaining 
ihe opinion I did, I ventured at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chillicothe" rel="city">Chillicothe</a> to speak with some 
freedom upon measures proposed there of a harsh character, and 
unjustified, as it appeared to me, by public exigences. It is to 
this cause that the strictures upon my conduct, alluded to in 
yours, are owing. They give me no pain, as I am conscious of 
having participated in no illegal projects of Burr, and know that 
I will not be suspected of having done so by any who know 
me. 
</p><p>
Alexander has been discharged for want of proof Bollmar 
and Swartwout remain in custody. They applied to the Supreme Court of the United States, now in session, for a writ of 
habeas corpus. Some of the judges doubted their power to 
grant it, as it was not included within the enumerated powers 
conferred upon that tribunal in the Constitution. The question 
has been discussed, and three judges to two [Chase and Johnson] have determined in favor of the application. The prisoners 
are to be brought before the Court to-day. 
</p><p>
The papers inform you of the great events passing upon the 
European theater. A measure has been lately taken by Bonaparte of a most gigantic nature, the declaration that the islands 
of Great Britain are in a state of blockade. It is said that our 
minister at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> has written on to Government that our commerce is not to be affected by it ; I apprehend, however, that it 
will subject it to much embarrassment. 
</p><p>
The session of Congress has not been so interesting as I had 
anticipated. No questions in relation to our foreign intercourse, 
involving much discussion, have been agitated ; every thing depends upon the result of pending negotiations, and this will not 
be known, it is probable, until the session expires. 
</p><p>
I expect to be accompanied to Kentucky by two young gentlemen, one proposing the practice and the other the study of 
the law, The latter will continue with me. I am glad to find 
that you have been getting acquainted with Strange. He is a 
valuable reporter, but occupies a second station only in the grade 
of merit. I calculate upon finding you much improved in your 
law knowledge. Two words will make any man of sound intellect a lawyer, industry and application, and the same words 
with a third, economy, will enable him to make a fortune. 
</p><p>
My respects to your fellow-students ; and tell them they have 
been very inattentive to me in not writing. 
</p><p>
Present me also to the very amiable and sensible man with 
whom you reside.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor inclosing a statement 
relative to Garland's debt, and bank notes amounting to $35, 
being $3 more than was the balance agreeably to the statement. I have since received a letter from Mr. Hoomes, in 
which he acknowledges that I have overpaid the proportion of 
the purchase of Buzzard coming from me. But as I have the 
collection, in Kentucky, of some money for his father's estate, 
there will be no difficulty in adjusting the excess. I am much 
indebted to the kindness of your brother and yourself for your 
attention to this matter, and I can not agree that he shall be 
without compensation for his trouble. I must, therefore, request 
that you will pay him $20, for which, as well as for the $3 
above mentioned, you shall be credited in the taxes upon your 
land. I do not think the present a very favorable period for 
selling your land, which I have no doubt is gradually rising in 
value. If, however, you are desirous to effect a sale, your object would probably be facilitated by such a descriptive survey 
of it as you mention. I can hardly suppose a survey necessary 
to the perpetuation of the boundaries ; surveys in that county 
having been generally made in connection, in such manner that 
they tend to prove each other, and the removal of the corner 
of one would derange the whole block. Instances have, indeed, 
occurred there of such fraudulent attempts ; but I believe they are 
rare. Should you desire to possess such an account of the quality of your lands as will enable you to satisfy the inquiries of 
purchasers, I need not say that, on this, as well as any other 
matter interesting to you, I shall take pleasure in promoting 
your wishes.

</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Dr. Beatty</a>, This day was fixed by resolution of the two 
Houses of Congress for its adjournment, but that resolution has 
been rescinded, and the session protracted one week longer. On 
the great subject of our foreign affairs, I believe we shall adjourn 
without adopting any efficient measure. A bill to augment the 
duties fifty per cent, has passed the House of Representatives, 
but I fear, like Macon's bill, it will not be concurred in by the 
Senate. One of its valuable effects, if it passes, will be the encouragement of our manufactures. As the increase is not" contemplated, however, to be permanent, I should prefer a smaller 
augmentation, and that it should be durable. 
</p><p>
Two committees of the House of Representatives are engaged in investigating Wilkinson's conduct (who has at length arrived), 
one into the Spanish conspiracy, and the other into the causes 
of the mortality of the army last summer. On this latter subject 
it is expected a report will be made this session ; upon the other 
a report will hardly be made before the next. 
Howard is appointed Governor of Louisiana.

Frankfort, May 31,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1810">1810</a>. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Dr. Beatty</a>, I received your favor, with the specimen inclosed of your merino's fleece, and compared it with one which 
I took from a full-blooded merino of General Mason's, and find 
very little difference between them. If you could send your 
wool, or the yarn, to a manufacturer in Danville, he would make 
you the best piece of cloth that you could obtain from it. I do 
not recollect his name, but he is an Englishman, accustomed to 
the business, and has undertaken, for Judge Todd, to make him 
a coat which he warrants shall not be inferior to the best imported cloth in the State. I propose sending mine to him. If, 
however, you prefer having it made in the neighborhood of 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, there will be no difficulty in getting it wove, fulled, 
etc. 
</p><p>
I am glad to learn that your election to the Legislature is 
deemed certain. Your presence there will be extremely necessary. I am solicitous for it on various accounts. You will have 
heard that I am no longer a candidate for the Senate, and that 
my successor will consequently be appointed. May not the 
Federalists attempt to rally in support of one of their party? 
This should be looked to. 
</p><p>
In offering for the House of Representatives, I was influenced 
by a partiality for the station, and by the wishes of some of my 
friends, as well here as to the East. I contemplate, however 
serving out the term for which I am already appointed in the 
Senate, not wishing to give the trouble of supplying my place 
for the ensuing session, and being desirous to prevent the possibility of the State being partially represented daring a considerable portion of it.

</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Dr. Beatty</a>, I received your favor of the 24th June. The 
nett yield of our merino (owing to the neglect or fraud of the 
shearer of him) was not sufficient to make me a coat. Mrs. 
Clay therefore determined to have it spun, and either applied to 
other uses, or retained until we could get an additional quantity. 
A Captain M'Call, in this neighborhood, has undertaken to weave 
and full, for Jordan, some yarn spun from the merino wool ; and 
if you can not better dispose of yours, I have no doubt Mr. 
Jordan can procure him to weave and full yours also. 
</p><p>
I learned with pleasure your decision in favor of again offering 
for the Legislature. Your success, I am told, is not doubted. 
The Republican interests will require, and, I am sure, will receive your best support. Whether the Federalists will or will 
not attempt a Senator of their own kind depends on the issue of 
the election. I believe Daviess will not be elected here ; and 
even Humphrey dreads the result of the Franklin election. 
</p><p>
P. S. I requested a Mr. Fowke, of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, to call on you for professional aid, which I hope you will afford.

for the term of one year, when Henry Clay left  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> it

My dear Sir, In great haste I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 13th March. Walker would undertake 
to explore your lands, and report to you particularly their situation, quality, and value. He would charge for the service, only 
his expenses, that is to say, about $2 per day, for twelve or 
fifteen days. He is a man of perfect integrity, and may be 
relied on for such an undertaking. When I spoke, in a former 
letter, of him, I did not mean to imply any question of his veracity, but merely to convey the idea, that he was a laughing, 
talking, good-natured sort of a fellow, who might express himself somewhat at random, unless he knew precision to be necessary. 
</p><p>
He himself recommends Daniel Ashley at Madisonville as a 
person on whom you may rely to report the desired information.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, I received your favor of the 9th. You mention 
that you have thought of becoming a candidate for the Senate, 
and, justly viewing me as one of your friends, you have asked 
my opinion. 
</p><p>
In the first place, I beg leave to state that I have always felt 
a most lively and sincere interest in your welfare, and that it 
would give me, personally, much satisfaction to see you in the 
situation suggested. With respect to your prospect of success I 
am not a very good judge, having been so much of late years 
out of the State, and therefore knowing but little of the weight 
and standing of different individuals. I hinted at the subject to 
Barry, who seemed to think that, living in one extreme of the 
State, however much esteemed there, you were probably hardly 
well enough known at the other to comment with any certainty upon 
your success. I did not mention it to Breckenridge, because I 
am quite sure that he proposes to himself the career of politics, 
and I have heard, though not from him, nor from any one that 
as far as I know, was authorized by him, that he is looking himself to the situation. I should think the event would greatly depend upon the persons who might happen to be your competitors. 
Should Colonel Johnson offer, (he has been talked of, with what 
authority from himself I know not,>) or perhaps Breckenridge, 
you would probably fail. 
</p><p>
I will now give you, in the frankness which is due from the friendship I feel for you, my opinion. I do not think yon ought 
to accept the situation, if you had a moral certainty of getting it. 
Although comfortable in your pecuniary condition, you are not 
rich, and you have a growing family. Instead of making additions to your fortune, you would most probably make annual subtractions from it, during your service. For if your pay should 
cover your expenses, while absent from your family, affairs would 
go on less profitably at home than they do now. Such, at least, 
is my experience ; and such I believe to be in the nature of 
things. Congress, too, has greater attractions at a distance than 
near. After the novelty wears off (which it commonly does in 
the course of two or three months), the interest which was at 
first felt is diminished, if not extinguished, with most of those, 
at least, who are nx)t perfectly at their ease in their circumstances, 
or who are not in pursuit of place, and are willing to venture 
every thing on getting it, or, lastly, those few individuals whose 
great attainments give them a high degree of prominence in the 
body and in the nation. 
</p><p>
With respect to yourself (I write, you see, with the frankness 
and freedom which you have invited,) your talents are of the 
most respectable kind ; but they are better adapted to the career 
which you have been wisely pursuing than to that of politics. 
While you would never fail to speak sensibly, your elocution 
would not perhaps procure for you that high degree of eminence 
which I am sure you would be ambitious of reaching. Besides, 
you have great reason to expect promotion in the judiciary of 
either the State or the United States, when vacancies shall occur. 
While judicial appointment might also be acquired in the situation to which we refer, it is perhaps not so direct a road to it as 
by a faithful and enlightened discharge of the duties of your 
present office. There is, moreover, always some risk (and it is 
greater as we are more advanced in hfe) in quitting an occupation 
with which one is familiar, and entering upon another with which 
he is less conversant. The intimate alliance between law and 
politics, and the habit which is so common in our country of 
participating in the consideration of its political affairs, diminishes 
but does not entirely remove this objection. 
</p><p>
I have given you my candid sentiments. Yom- own better 
judgment will, at last, guide you, as it ought ; and that you may 
be successful and prosperous, however you may decide, is my 
sincere wish.

Dear Sir, I received your obliging favor of the 10th inst., 
from Frankfort, and thank you for the friendly feelings toward 
me of which it furnishes the evidence. On the subject of the 
next Governor I had communicated my views, prior to the receipt of your letter, to several friends at Frankfort, from whom 
you must have learned them before you left that place. I have 
regretted exceedingly my inability to conform to the wishes of 
those whose kindness has made them look to me for that office. 
</p><p>
I am glad to find that the course which it seems to me fitting 
for this country to pursue, in respect to Spanish affairs, meets with 
your concurrence. The extraordinary one recommended by the 
President excited much surprise in Congress, and has, I think 
very few of that body disposed to adopt it. The general embarrassments throughout the country, the deficit in the Treasury, 
and other causes, have communicated their influence to Congress, 
and produced the efiect of great repugnance to war and to any 
augmentation of the national expenditure. Add to which the 
various alternatives which the failure of Spain to ratify the treaty 
presents to our choice, and I should not be surprised if the result 
should be that Congress will do nothing on Spanish affairs, but 
leave them where it found them. I should regret this very much, 
because I think it would be precisely the result most gratifying 
to Spain. 
</p><p>
At present Spanish affairs, manufactures, and every other matter of public concern, have given way to the Missouri question, 
which engrosses the whole thoughts of the members, and constitutes almost the only topic of conversation. It is a most unhappy question, awakening sectional feelings, and exasperating 
them to the highest degree. The words, civil war, and disunion, 
are uttered almost without emotion, and a Senator of the United 
States, in his place, as I understand, said the other day that he 
would rather have both than fail in the resolution. I witnessed 
yesterday a display of astonishing eloquence, in the Senate, on 
the part of Mr. Pinkney of Indiana against the restriction. In 
that body the majority is with us ; in the House of Representatives it is doubtful. 
</p><p>
I think nothing will be done by Congress respecting the currency.

My dear Sir, ^You will have seen a note which I addressed 
to the editors of the " Intelligencer," on the subject of the business of Ghent. I wish to say one word to you on it. To those 
who have attentively read the controversial papers between 
Messrs. Russell and Adams, and particularly the appendix to the 
book of tlie latter, it must be apparent that the honorable secretary has labored to draw me into the controversy, by the manner 
in which he has alluded to my name, and the inconsistency 
which, on one occasion, he imputes to me. I had but one alternative, either to acquiesce, by my silence, in all misrepresentations ; or, by a sort of protest, to reserve to myself the right of 
correcting errors on some future fit occasion. I might, indeed, 
have rushed into the controversy between those two gentlemen, or 
commenced a new one ; but I hope my friends will believe me 
incapable of committing suclj^an indiscretion, as I conceive that 
would be, of doing at this time the one or the other. I chose 
the latter because of the alternative stated, and I hope you will 
approve of the step I have taken. My purpose is answered, my 
ground is taken, and those who know me will not want to be 
assured that I will adhere to both. I shall write no more until 
I think the period has arrived which I have indicated. The 
honorable secretary seems to deplore its possible distance. I 
shall remain unmoved by any regrets he may feel on account of 
the want of fresh aliment for new strife. 
</p><p>
The newspapers will communicate to you the events which have occurred here. As they chose to have a second caucus, I 
was glad it took place before I reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbus" rel="city">Columbus</a>. Considering 
the great efforts made from without to prevent any legislative 
expression of public opinion, the proof which is afforded by the 
vote here is extremely strong. My friends believe that from 
eighty to ninetj^ out of the one hundred and three members, who 
compose the General Assembly, are in my favor ; and there is 
among the former the greatest zeal, animation, and confidence. 
</p><p>
I am anxious to learn the names of your commissioners. Expecting to reach  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> by the 22d instant, I shall be glad 
to have the pleasure of hearing from you on my arrival there.

My dear Sir, T have received your obliging favor of the 
29th instant. The considerations were so many and so powerful, calling upon your State to ratify the convention with Kentucky, that I confess to you frankly I did not anticipate the 
event which you say will probably happen. In that event I 
shall deeply regret that Virginia ever again opened the negotiation, after respecting the professions which Mr. Bibb and I submitted to your Legislature last winter. Why did Virginia ask 
a reference of the claim of her State limit? Could she suppose 
that Kentucky would refer it and leave herself exposed, after the 
decision of the referees, to the claim, as if it had never been 
submitted to arbitration? Could she think that the mockery of 
creating a tribunal was to be presented to decide a controversy, 
respecting which the parties were to be as free and unbound after 
the decision as before the reference. If she had no power to 
refer ; if she had no authority to bind her constituents, then she 
ought not to have moved in the business; and the first error was 
committed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and not at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. For my part 
I believe the State line hound by the decision, and that the 
guaranty is the mere expression of a fair implication from the 
whole transaction without it. And it was only to render the 
convention more explicit, and to preclude the necessity of resorting to any interpretations about which disputes might arise, that 
it appeared to me to be expedient to insert the clause of guaranty. 
Upon the whole I must say, that if you reject the convention, 
</p><p>
I think the impartial world will look upon you as being clearly 
in the wrong. 
</p><p>
I am extremely sorry to find that any of my friends believe 
that I was not called upon to address the note which was recently published in the Intelligencer, respecting certain questions 
arising at Ghent. Had <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, either before or after his 
several publications, designed to consult me about the use which 
he has freely made in them of my name ; had he said to me " Mr. 
Clay, I have imputed to you such and such opinions, and made 
statements about the part you acted at Ghent ; if I am inaccurate in any of them I will take pleasure in correcting the error," 
I should have felt myself required to address <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> personally, and not the public. But he never communicated to me 
any one of his publications, and I never had an opportunity even 
of seeing his book until my arrival here. Having chosen, without my knowledge or consent, to usher my name into the public 
journals ; having imputed to me, as he does in his appendix, inconsistencies, and by an innuendo insinuated that I was the author 
of an editorial article in Kentucky, which I never saw until I 
read it in the paper in which it was printed, I felt myself absolved from all obligation to make any direct appeal to Mr. 
Adams himself. In addressing the note which I did to the public, it was my intention merely to enter a caveat against the correctness of all his statements, and to exhibit a public reservation 
of a right on my part to rectify mistakes, when the proper occasion should arrive. Considering the relation in which both of 
us now stand to the public, I thought the present an unsuitable 
moment even to hazard any controversy with him ; and if I 
could prostrate him in the dust I would not write at this time. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind information respecting the state of 
the public mind in Virginia.
</p><p>
I look upon this struggle with all the philosophy which I ought 
to do. On one resolution my friends may rest assured I will 
firmly rely, and that is, to participate in no intrigues, to enter 
into no arrangements, to make no promises or pledges ; but that, 
whether I am elected or not, I will have nothing to reproach 
myself with. If elected I will go into the office with a pure 
conscience, to promote with my utmost exertions the common 
good of our country, and free to select the most able and faithful 
public servants. If not elected, acquiescing most cheerfully in 
the better selection which will thus have been made, I will atleast have the satisfaction of preserving my honor unsuihed, and my heart uncorriipted. 
</p><p>
I shall remain here during the greater part of the term of the 
Supreme Court, in which I have some professional business, particularly the cause between the bank and the State of Ohio. 
</p><p>
I shall be glad that your leisure may allow you to give me 
the pleasure of again hearing from you. 
</p><p>
P. S. What course does Virginia mean to take after refuting 
the guaranty? Does she intend again to open the negotiation? 
To propose that the Board of Commissioners shall now proceed 
without the clause of guaranty? Or to make a rupture of all 
negotiations and fly to arms? I mean forensic arms.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received your friendly letter of the 19th inst., as I did the preceding one to which it refers. The course 
which the business between our respective States has taken, fills 
me with so much regret and concern, that I will not dwell upon 
it, especially as it has probably terminated finally, and had, therefore better be forgotten as soon as it can be. What is done can 
not be changed, and it is not conformable to my temper or habit, 
to indulge in unavailing regrets. I prefer always looking to the 
future. I observe vv^hat you state with respect to the condition 
of the public feeling in Virginia, in regard to the next Presidency. 
I ever thought that the line of conduct which the Virginia gentleman had marked out for that State, that is, to take no forward 
part in the ensuing election, but rather to leave the decision of 
it to the residue of the Union, was wise and discreet. It would 
have been thought that Virginia was dictatorial, if after ceasing 
to furnish a chief magistrate, she should have displayed any early 
and anxious solicitude about the successor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="">Mr. Monroe</a>. But 
has Virginia acted in consonance with this avowed purpose? Has 
not that point, which heretofore has invariably indicated her pleasure, distinctly taken its ground? Has it not been confidently proclaimed, and been believed, every where out of Virginia, that her 
choice was fixed? May not the effect of all this be, to jeopardize, not only that preference, if it be actually made, but also the 
election of him who would be her second choice? 
</p><p>
Virginia may possibly decide the election by bestowing her suffrage on the gentleman referred to, though I doubt it extremely. 
But she certainly can decide it by lending her support to him 
who is said to be her second choice. She will, of course, as she 
ought to, determine as she pleases in such contingencies.
</p><p>
In saying that it is my firm conviction that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> is at 
present the most formidable, I pray you to believe that I do not 
mean (far from it), to indicate any preference for him, nor am I moved, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> expense, by the desire of advancing 
my own interests.
</p><p>
Connect yourselves with the West, and are you not, whether 
the election is won or lost, on the vantage ground? You see, 
my dear sir, that I write you with all the freedom of an ancient 
friendship, which could alone excuse the presentation to you of 
views, which, I dare say, have often been taken by you. 
</p><p>
I pray you to give my best respects to your associate, Judge 
Green, whose acquaintance I had the pleasure of making last 
winter, and for whose character I have a high regard. '

</p><p>
My dear Sir, You will have seen that the Supreme Court 
has decided against the validity of our occupying claimant laws. 
The dissatisfaction which will be felt by the people of Kentucky, with the decision, will be aggravated in no little degree, 
by the fact, that the decision is that of three judges to one, a minority, therefore, of the whole court ; and this aggravation will 
be further increased by considerations which belong to either of 
these three judges. 
</p><p>
At the moment of some vexation about this unhappy result of a 
cause, the effects and possible consequences of which, fill me with extreme concern, I wrote you my last letter, and I fear that 
I expressed myself in it, on some points, in a manner which I 
ought not to have done, even to one whom I have ever regarded 
as one of my best friends. I must pray you, therefore, to commit it to the flames, and its contents to oblivion. * * *

</p><p>
I received, my dear sir, your very obliging letter of the 14th 
instant, and I pray you to believe that I do not place less value 
on your friendship because you have nothing to communicate 
"more favorable to my prospects." On the subject to which you allude, I assure you most sincerely I look with great calmness, 
and with a most perfect determination to acquiesce cheerfully in 
whatever choice the nation may make. It would be a poor compliment to our institutions, to say that their solidity, or the public 
happiness, materially depended upon any election that shall 
take place. I really think, however, that Virginia can not justify herself to the Union for the apathy which you say prevails 
there on the question. Judging, as I have done at this distance, 
from the " Enquirer" and other Virginia prints, I had supposed 
that great interest was felt and generally taken in its decision, 
and that there was even danger of her overstepping the line of 
cautious circumspection, which her leading politicians were understood to have marked out for her. 
</p><p>
This indifference, you say, arises from the absence of any 
pledge that the great interests of the people of Virginia will be 
taken care of by any of the competitors for the chief magistracy. 
If, indeed, no such pledge is to be found in the principles, integrity, and characters, as heretofore developed, of either of the 
candidates, it is, I should think, quite too late in the day now 
for any pledge to be given or received. But, my dear sir, what 
interests have Virginia and the South separate from the Union? 
You have mentioned a single subject only, that of the encroachments of the Federal judiciary on State rights ; and, as connected 
with this, the broad doctrine now inculcated, that Congress has 
the right to extend, not to regulate only, the jurisdiction of the 
Federal Courts." On that subject I am entirely at a loss to conceive any peculiar interest in the State of Virginia, and the 
Southern States. All are equally concerned in the jurisdiction 
of the State sovereignties. All would be equally affected by 
Federal usurpation. But I must confess that it is the first time 
that I ever heard asserted such a doctrine as you say is now inculcated. The limit of the Federal judiciary is to be found in 
the Constitution, and Congress can vest in it no power which is 
not there found. If such a doctrine as you state is really attempted to be inculcated, you will find Kentucky now, as in the 
epoch of 1799, in spite of all your unkindness toward her, ready 
to co-operate with you in opposing it, and no man in the Union 
will be more prompt than I shall be to second the opposition. 
I can not suppose you to refer to the power that is claimed for 
the general Government, to give effect to its laws through its own 
judiciary. For, without that power, without Federal means to effectuate the constitutional resolves of the Federal will, there is 
an end to the general Government that is inevitable, if not instantaneous anarchy. 
</p><p>
But, my dear sir, on this subject of the Federal judiciary and 
State rights, I mean to say a few words to you, in the spirit of 
Virginia independence, and in the frankness of sincere friendship. 
Has not Virginia exposed herself to the imputation of selfishness, 
by the course of her conduct, or of that of many of her politicians? 
When, in the case of Cohans and Virginia, her authority was 
alone concerned, she made the most strenuous efforts against the 
exercise of power by the Supreme Court. But when the thunders of that Court were directed against poor Kentucky, in vain 
did she invoke Virginian aid. The Supreme Court, it was imagined, would decide on the side of supposed interests of Virginia. It has so decided ; and, in effect, cripples the sovereign 
power of the State of Kentucky more than any other measure 
ever affected the independence of any State in this Union, and 
not a Virginia voice is heard against the decision. The Supreme 
Court is viewed with complacency, and as a very different sort 
of tribunal from that Supreme Court which decided Cohans' 
case. 
</p><p>
Again : of all the irregular bodies, none can be more so than 
a Congressional caucus at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. None have a more consolidating tendency. Indeed, it is espoused upon the principle 
of preventing the exercise of State or Federal rights through the 
medium of the House of Representatives. Yet the Virginia 
politicians (at least if we are to judge from the papers) warmly 
advocate the constitution of such a caucus. Will it not be said 
that they are influenced by the consideration, not of preserving 
unimpaired State rights, but of giving to the State power of 
Virginia the utmost effect of which it is capable? Or that of 
securing the election of the alleged favorite, who, without the 
instrumentality of such an assemblage, is in danger of losing the 
election? It is in vain to speak of the inconveniences of a 
warmly-contested election. They are incident to our system, 
and are happily provided for by it. And the transitions from a 
Congressional caucus to a pretorian cohort or hereditary monarchy, to escape from those vexations, are not so great as we 
might at first imagine. 
</p><p>
I am aware that on two subjects I have the misfortune to 
differ with many of my Virginia friends internal improvements and home manufactures. My opinion has been formed after 
much deliberation, and my best judgment yet tells me that I am 
right. I have not time, nor would it be fitting as regards your 
comfort, now to discuss the policy or the power of fostering these 
interests. I believe Virginia and the Southern States as much 
interested, directly or indirectly, as any other parts of the Unior, 
in their encouragement. When the Government was first adopted 
we had no interior. Our population was inclosed between the 
sea and the mountains which run parallel to it. Since then the 
west part of your State, the western parts of New York and 
Pennsylvania, and all the Western States, have been settled. 
The wars of Europe consumed all the surplus produce on both 
sides of the mountains. Those wars have terminated, and emigration has ceased. We find ourselves annually in possession of 
an immense surplus. There is no market for it abroad ; there is 
none at home. If there were a foreign market, before we, in the 
interior, could reach it, the intervening population would have supplied it. There can be no foreign market adequate to the consumption of the vast and growing surplus of the produce of our 
agriculture. We must, then, have a home market. Some of us 
must cultivate ; some fabricate. And we must have reasonable 
protection against the machinations of foreign powers. On the 
sea-board you want a navy, fortifications, protection, foreign 
commerce. In the interior we want internal improvements, 
home manufactures. You have what you want, and object to 
our getting what we want. Should not the interests of both 
parties be provided for? 
</p><p>
It has appeared to me, in the administration of the general 
Government, to be a just principle to inquire what great interests 
belong to each section of our country, and to promote those interests, as far as practicable, consistently with the Constitution, 
having always an eye to the welfare of the whole. Assuming 
this principle, does any one doubt that if New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and the Western States 
constituted an independent nation, it would immediately protect 
the important interests in question? And is it not to be feared 
that, if protection is not to be found for vital interests, from the 
existing systems, in great parts of the confederacy, those parts 
will ultimately seek to establish a system that will afford the 
requisite protection? I would not, in the application of the principle indicated, give to the peculiar interests of great sections all the protection which they would probably receive if those sections constituted separate and independent States. I would, 
however, extend some protection, and measure it by balancing 
the countervailing interests, if there be such, in other quarters of 
the Union. 
</p><p>
I concur entirely with you in thinking that the north and 
east, but particularly New England, have laid, in a great measure, the other parts of the Union under contribution. And of 
all the ill-advised measures, of all the wasteful expenditures of 
public money, the Revolutionary pension list pre-eminently takes 
the lead. Never was there more public money spent, with less 
practical benefit. But who proposed it? Your own <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="">Monroe</a>. 
I thought of it then as I think of it now ; but opposition would 
have been silly and vain. 
</p><p>
You will oppose my election, I suppose, in Virginia. I have 
no right to complain. Silence and submission are my duty. You 
will oppose me because I think that the interests of all parts of 
the Union should be taken care of ; in other words, that the interests of the interior, on the two subjects mentioned, as well as 
that of the maritime coast, ought to be provided for. You will 
give your suffrages to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> ; and if Mr. Crawford or Mr. Adams be elected, I venture to predict that we 
shall find, either in his inaugural speech, or in the first message 
or speech (perhaps the latter mode of communication may be revived) to Congress, a recommendation of efficient encouragement 
to domestic manufactures and internal improvements. 
</p><p>
I am afraid that you will think me in a very bad humor. Far 
from it. I repeat that I never enjoyed more perfect composure. 
My health, it is true, is extremely bad, and I am now confined 
at home by the endeavor to re-establish it. But it neither affects 
my tranquillity or gives me the spleen. In regard to the election, 
as to which I will make no professions of affecting an indifference, which I do not feel, my friends continue to be very confident ;. and my own opinion is that my prospects are not surpassed by those of either of the other gentlemen, still I am not 
unaware that all things are uncertain ; and I therefore continue 
resolved to preserve my philosophy, my principles, and my conscience, be the event what it may. 
</p><p>
Has not our friend Southard been rapidly advanced? He 
certainly has merit, and his friend, the Secretary of War, has 
discernment.

It would have given me great pleasure to see you, as it will 
to meet you any where again. Can you not run up to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> next winter? To a close observer there will be a scene 
there exhibited worth surveying. Wherever you are, I pray you 
to be persuaded that my best wishes attend you. 
</p><p>
P. S. I send you my elusions as they are poured out through 
a mercurial course, on which the doctors have put me ; and wish 
no copy for others. I write for yourself alone.

My DEAR Sir, A friend informs me that, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, my 
arrangement of the committees of the House of Representatives 
has been the subject of some animadversion, in consequence of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jab" rel="colleague met">Mr. Barbour</a>, late Speaker, not being at the head of any committee. The truth is, that it was my intention to have appointed 
him chairman of one of the most prominent committees, of the 
House, but he entreated me not to put him at the head of any 
committee, nor on any committee, which might require much of 
his time, as he wished to employ it exclusively in study. I should 
certainly not offer, even to a friend, any explanation of my official 
conduct in such a matter, if it were not to prevent misconception 
 
</p><p>
of my motives in respect to a gentleman between whom and 
myself unfortunately some competition existed. I am sure if he 
were apprised (he is now absent from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>) of the erroneous impression existing at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, he would himself hasten 
to correct it. I have a full share of human frailties ; but a want 
of consideration for a competitor, in relation to any object, does 
not, if I know myself, happen to be one of them. 
</p><p>
Did you get a lengthy letter that I wrote you in August or 
September last?

My dear Sir, I duly received your obliging letter of the 18th 
instant. I am glad to hear of the probability of the recovery of 
Colonel Taylor's health. With respect to his opinions on the 
subject to which you refer, whatever they may be, they can not 
diminish that habitual veneration for him which I have ever 
cherished. 
</p><p>
On the point of a caucus, in a spirit of perfect desperation, a 
continual effort is making to get one up. It will be defeated, 
you may rely, either by being voted down, in a general attendance of the Republican members, or by a resolution of a large 
majority of them not to attend. If they make one, it will be a 
faction a cabal. My friends say, that on the score of mere expediency, they have no objection to a caucus which shall be 
composed of the Republican members generally ; that they have no 
fears of the result of such a caucus ; but that they have no idea 
of consenting to make part of a caucus in which they should act 
the part of mevefguranti, which would be the case if the friends 
of other candidates, who, it is well known, would not attend, 
should be absent. ****** 
</p><p>
With great regard, I am faithfully your friend.

My DEAR Sir, It is some time since I had the pleasure of 
hearing from you. In the interval, several events of importance 
have occurred. The miserable attempt at a caucus, you will 
have seen accounts of. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> never could have been 
elected, but I venture to predict that the mere fact of seeking, 
by means of a caucus so got up, and so constituted, will destroy whatever prospects he ever had. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> has with- ! 
drawn. This has been produced by events in Pennsylvania, 
evincing, beyond all doubt, the determination of that State to 
support <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. The circle of competition is thus 
much circumscribed, and you may rely upon it, that you will 
have, as your next President, Adams, Jackson, or myself. You 
will have, in Virginia, to choose between these three evils. It 
is madness, it is perfect infatuation, to think, at this time, of any 
body else. Our intelligence from New York, continues to be 
favorable to the hopes of my friends. Still we shall have nothing absolutely decisive from that quarter, until time has elapsed 
to enable us to hear what the consequences there will be of the 
caucus. The present moment is one of great importance to me 
in Virginia. Now is the time to make a demonstration for me 
there, if ever. My friends accordingly, I understand, contemplate the formation of an electoral ticket for me, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
and think of putting you at the head of it, if you consent. 
Such a ticket, announced at this time, whatever may be its ultimate fate to Virginia, will have the very best effects out of Virginia. 
</p><p>
As soon as I hear from New York, I will communicate to 
you. In the mean time, I should be glad to hear from you. Mr. Crawford's friends will make an effort as long as they adhere to 
him, to exclude me from the House of Representatives, in the 
hope that my Western friends will take him, if they can not 
get me. They utterly deceive themselves. If they accomplish 
that object, and bring him into the house with Adams and Jackson, to my exclusion, he can not be elected. As I have told you 
before, the north-western States will go for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, if they 
can not get me. They will vote for no man residing in a slave 
State but me, and they vote for me because of other and chiefly 
local considerations, outweighing the slave objections. On that 
you may depend. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, then, will have the six New 
England States, and three north-western States, with the chance 
(and the best chance), for New York (if I am out of the way), 
New Jersey, Maryland, to say nothing of Alabama, Mississippi, 
and Louisiana,

My dear Sir, During your sojourn at home, I did not write 
you any letter except one, which I addressed to you some days 
ago, at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, with a direction to the post-master at that

you may return or destroy, after perusing the contents. Other 
letters, to other persons, have, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, corroborated their 
statements, and represent, first that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> can not possibly obtain the vote of New York ; secondly, that great dissatisfaction prevails at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, with such a caucus as was held 
here, and especially with the person nominated as Vice-President; and thirdly, that there is no contest in New York, but between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and me. Pennsylvania has gone inevitably to Jackson.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I have received the three last letters which 
you have done me the favor to write to me. On the subject to 
which they relate, there appears to be an eddy at this moment. 
We shall soon see which way the currents will break out. Information from -every quarter assures us that the caucus here has 
impaired, instead of advancing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> prospects. The 
convention at Harrisburg, no doubt, the day before yesterday, 
recommended <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> ; and they probably forebore to 
make any recommendation of a Vice-President ; or, if they did 
/ make any, I think it was <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> they are 
probably looking to Harrisburg, and waiting for events. It is 
now believed, that the Senate of New York will reject the Electoral Bill, the committee of that body having made a report 
against it. But, rest assured, that all inferences derived from 
that fact in favor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> are utterly fallacious. He 
can not obtain the vote of that State. 
</p><p>
I concur with you in thinking that my friends at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> 
 
</p><p>
and in Virginia ought to avoid, if possible, all misunderstanding 
with those of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> ; and a temperate and conciliatory 
character would therefore be best to be given to any appeal made 
to the people in my behalf. 
</p><p>
I have just heard that De Witt Clinton has arrived here. I 
pray you not to think it necessary to answer every letter which 
I may address to you. I should be glad to hear from you occasionally, and when perfectly convenient.

My dear Sir, I received your obliging favor of the 14th. 
The ticket formed by my friends at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, appears to me, 
upon the whole, to be extremely judicious ; and its good eifect 
elsewhere, I think I am not deceived in. The Senate of New 
York, has by a vote pf seventeen to fourteen, postponed the 
Electoral Bill. The first and most certain eifect of that note is 
to prevent Mr. Clinton from being a candidate ; and I have no 
doubt that that was the principal object with the majority. If 
there had been a popular election of electors, he would probably 
have come out, and very likely would have obtained the vote 
of that State. 
</p><p>
The course of Mr. Randolph's friends about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> surprises me. My conscience acquits rtie entirely of all blame 
toward that gentleman. Throughout all our acquaintance he 
has ever been the assailant. I have ever been on the defensive. 
The House of Representatives has ever taken part with me, and 
against him, in every collision that I ever had with him.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received your favor of the 16th inst. 
I did not become acquainted with Colonel Gooch while he was 
here. An incident that occurred may serve to explain the charge 
to which you refer. It is the duty of the Speaker to admit 
stenographers. Mr. Stevenson said to me, " Colonel Gooch is 
here, and probably would like to take down the debates, etc., 
for the '' Enquirer" during his stay, but I am not authorized to 
apply for his admission." I replied, if Colonel Gooch wants a 
seat within the hall, bond fide for that purpose, he shall be admitted ; but that I could not consent to his admission merely 
to give him a comfortable place, without reference to the duties 
of a stenographer. Mr. Stevenson said he should advise him 
not to apply, etc. He did not make an application. I afterward understood that he complained ; but I was also told that, 
after an explanation with Mr. Stevenson, he left here entirely 
satisfied with my conduct. 
</p><p>
I inclose you the extract of a letter which has been sent me 
from New York, respecting a contemplated call of the Legislature. I have very little doubt that such a measure has been 
determined on, and will take place, unless the Governor changes 
his intention. If my efforts on the tariff have injured me in 
Virginia, they have benefited me in other quarters.

My dear Sir, The state of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> health is such as 
scarcely to leave a hope of his recovery. It is said that he has 
sustained a paralytic stroke. His friends begin to own that his 
death is now but too probable, and that in any event he can no 
longer be held up for the presidency. 
</p><p>
I conjecture that a visit which <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> and Governor Dickinson, of New Jersey, are about to make to Virginia, is connected with this circumstance, and that they are about to take

Dear Sir, I transmit you the inclosed just as I have received 
it. The person who writes it (and whose acquaintance I would 
like you to make, if convenient) became known to me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbus" rel="city">Columbus</a>, in Ohio, in January,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1823">1823</a>. He traveled with Judge Burnett and myself from that place to Wheeling, and interested us 
both by the variety and extent of his information, particularly in 
regard to characters now on the stage. He subsequently manifested a good deal of zeal in my behalf, and has frequently written me letters, to which I have sometimes replied, respectfully but 
</p><p>
cautiously. If the communication from Mr. is to be 
</p><p>
considered in the nature of an overture, there can be but one 
answer given. I can make no promises of office, of any sort, to 
any one, upon any condition whatever. Whatever support shall 
be given to me, if any, must be spontaneous and unbought. I 
</p><p>
can not but believe that Mr. 's friend must have allowed 
</p><p>
his zgal to cary him further than was authorized. 
</p><p>
We have nothing new in this quarter. All that we believed 
in respect to the favorable disposition toward me is well founded.

Dear Sir, I received your obliging favor of the 7th instant 
from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, with the proclamation of the Governor of 
New York inclosed. I was of course prepared to expect that 
measure, the only effect of which will be, should the Legislature 
pass the proposed law, to place the vote of that State to some 
candidate other than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>. 
</p><p>
We have nothing new at the West, where I find every thing 
to be as I expected. You will see candidates announced for 
election in this State for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, etc. This is the result of the absence of all sort of concert by means of 
caucuses, or other nominating appendages in Kentucky. Every 
body who chooses puts himself forward as a candidate. The 
State is divided into three districts, according to which it has given 
its electoral vote for many years past. No change was made in 
consequence of one of its own citizens being brought forward, 
because it was known that no change was necessary to insure 
him the entire vote of the State. Nor is there a county, parish, 
or a respectable neighborhood in the whole State, in which he 
would not obtain the majority over all competition. In Ohio, 
Indiana, and Illinois, as well as in Missouri, the result I believe 
to be equally certain. I shall go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbus" rel="city">Columbus</a> to attend the 
Federal Court, which begins there on the second Monday in July. 
Should you write to me at any time after the receipt of this 
letter, and before the 20th of July, be pleased to address me at 
that place. I am anxious to see the indications, which will 
shortly be given at the South, of the dispositions of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> friends, should he be withdrawn, of which I do not doubt, 
sooner or later. My interest, I think, will be benefited by his 
being continued to be held up for some time to come. The 
tariff fever will have then somewhat abated. My respectful 
compliments to Mrs. Johnston.

Before I came to this State, popular meetings in various counties had been held. Some have occurred since I entered it. 
The evidence derivable from their expression of preference 
among the presidential candidates, places beyond all sort of doubt 
the final result here.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, Your obliging favor of the 9th inst., dated at 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saratoga" rel="city">Saratoga</a>, and those subsequently at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, have all safely 
arrived. They reached  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> during my absence on a short 
excursion to one of our watering-places, from which I am but 
just returned. 
</p><p>
I concur with you in thinking that, considering all the combinations that may arise, and the contingences that may happen, 
my friends ought to persevere in their support of me. That, I 
believe, is the course which they have determined on generally. 
And I think the six States heretofore supposed to be disposed to 
support me, may still be relied on. You have no doubt heard 
from Louisiana. Your Governor elect passed through  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, 
and I presume you will have seen him. The information derived from him and other sources, assures us of the unaltered 
state of Louisiana, although in the city of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, the 
Jackson ticket prevailed in the greater part. Those opposed to 
me in that State, admit a plurality of the Legislature to be for 
me, while my friends confidently claim the majority. What is 
most to be apprehended, is, that my friends in the West, or at 
least in some of the more doubtful States, may become discouraged by the little prospect of my being supported to any 
extent in the East, and especially by the statements in the "National Intelligencer," and other papers, according to which it 
would seem that I have not a friend in the New York Legislature. 
</p><p>
The anticipated coalition in New York, I should suppose was 
very probable, unless it should be prevented by the apprehension 
of the imputation of corruption, bargaining, etc. Perhaps there 
may be nerve enough to encounter all the odium of those imputations, considering the quarter from which they must emanate. 
If there be a majority of the Legislature who prefer either of 
two candidates to a third, there is surely reason in an equal division of its vote between those two. The effect of such a division would doubtless be to exclude the third from the House 
of Representatives, and it would lead to the election of one or 
the other of them most certainly. In the actual state of the 
circumstances of the election. New York would have two 
strings to her bow by dividing her suffrage, and more certainly 
secure influence in the new administration, than by risking her 
whole vote upon one of the candidates, since, if she were so to 
concentrate it, she could not be sure of effecting his election. 
</p><p>
What about the Vice-President? Is New York desirous of electing Mr. Sanford? Has he any, arid what interest there? 
In Ohio there is a strong disposition to elect a Vice-President from New York, and Mr. Sanford has been favorably brought 
forward there. Here, also, his name has been advantageously announced to the public, and there would not be the slightest 
difficulty in his obtaining the votes of both States, and probably of the other States inclined to give me their suffrages. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my respects to Mrs. Johnston, and believe me faithfully and cordially your friend.

My DEAR Sir, I received to-day your favor under date the 
4th, with its inclosures, as I did your former letters, including 
General M'Clure's letter. I thank you for them. I have directed 
twenty copies of the circular prepared by the Kentucky Committee of Correspondence (which I have not seen), to be forwarded to you for distribution. Copies have also been ordered 
to most of our friends in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> and New York. Although 
I have not perused it, I presume, from the pen from which it 
issues, that it is well composed. An address from the same 
quarter has been written to Virginia, intended for that region, 
but so guarded as to do mischief nowhere, if it be published, 
which is to be anticipated. These papers will, I think, contribute to arouse and animate my friends. The remark which you 
make is but too true, that there has not been sufficient united exertion among them. Every thing is yet going well in the West. 
It is amazing to see the mistakes or misstatements made about it 
at the East. For example : Stratten was said to be elected in 
Missouri, and was claimed by the " Franklin Gazette" for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. No, says the " National Journal," although he is 
elected, we know he is for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. Now, it turns out that 
Scott is elected, and that Stratten declared himself for me.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, I duly received your obliging favor of the 19th 
ultimo, under date at New York, transmitting a letter from Mr. Ingalls, from whom I had previously received a duplicate. I did 
not, however, answer his letter. Eight months ago, I supposed 
there would be no difficulty in my election as Vice-President, if 
my friends had thought it advisable to press me for that office. I 
It would now be extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to effect that object, if it were desirable. My friends in the West do 
not attach any very great, perhaps not sufficient, importance to 
that station ; and it would be, I apprehend, nearly impossible now 
to induce them to divert their support of me from the first to the 
second office. And if they could be prevailed on to do it, the 
electoral colleges would hardly be induced, by any possible exertion, to unite their individual suffrages on any other candidate 
for the Presidency. There could, therefore, be no support se- . 
cured for me in the Atlantic States for the Vice-Presidency, if it I 
depended on concert among my Western friends, in regard to the 
office of President. And consequently, if I received any, it must 
be spontaneous, without reference to the direction which my interest would take as to the Presidency. If my Eastern friends 
think proper to bring me forward for the office of Vice-President, 
I wish it distinctly understood, that it is their own movement, 
unprompted by me. If an idea were taken up that the office 
was sought by me, after all that has occurred, it could not fail 
to be injurious to me. It would be said to display a most inordinate desire for office, which I certainly am not conscious of 
feeling. It would not look well, in any respect, if it were supposed that I was instrumental in the attempt to elect me. It is 
certainly a high and dignified office, such as no American citizen 
could readily decline. 
</p><p>
With respect to the movement in Massachusetts to which Mr. 
Ingalls refers, while I concur with you entirely in the state of 
public feeling in New England toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, I do not believe that there is the smallest prospect of diverting the vote of 
Massachusetts from him. There may be some probability of 
such a diversion in other States of that section, but none whatever, I apprehend, in Massachusetts. Depend upon it, that local 
pride, if not attachment, will secure to each of the candidates 
the support of his own State, doubtless with more opposition in 
some instances than in others. It would, therefore, be an act of 
extreme indiscretion, justified by no motive whatever, for me, or 
for any of my friends out of Massachusetts, to say to Mr. Ingalls, 
and to those who are co-operating with him, that I am willing 
to give up all pretensions to the office of President, and to be 
contented with that of Vice-President. 
</p><p>
By the by, it has been said here that a feeling is prevailing in 
some of the Atlantic cities to make the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="colleague met">Marquis Lafayette</a> Vice President. Such a disposition of the office would be highly 
creditable to the national gratitude, if it could be made without 
any constitutional impediment. 
</p><p>
I do not anticipate much from the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> meeting. It 
is a little remarkable, that my support of the tariff has excited 
against me, in the South, a degree of opposition which is by no 
means counterbalanced by any espousal of my cause in Pennsylvania and other quarters, where the tariff was so much desired. 
Is this owing to the greater activity which the losing party 
almost always displays than the gaining? 
</p><p>
I expect every day that the Committee of Correspondence, appointed by the Legislature of the State, will prepare their general circular, as suggested in my last. A copy of it shall be forwarded to you. Do you correspond with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pbp" rel="colleague friend met">General Peter B. Porter</a>? His residence is Black Rock. 
</p><p>
I can not close without expressing to you my thanks for the 
zeal and interest which you manifest in my favor ; nor without 
adding, that you have fulfilled entirely all my expectations as to 
the discretion which you would manifest.

My dear Sir, In respect to the Vice-Presidency, I wrote you 
some days ago. When my name was brought forward seriously, 
I resolved neither to offer nor to accept any arrangement in regard to myself, or to office for others. I have adhered to that 
resolution hitherto, and shall continue to abide by it to the last. 
I Considered that I was and ought to be in the hands of the 
public, to be disposed of as it pleased. Most undoubtedly the 
office of Vice-President is one of high respectability and great 
dignity, preferable, in my opinion, to any place in the cabinet. 
If the acceptance of it were offered to me (I mean by the public 
having the right to tender it), I could not decline it ; but I can 
not seek it, much less make any sacrifices of honor or duty to 
obtain it.

Mr. Holley, just returned from an Eastern trip, saw <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>

I thank you for your kind admonition about the unceitainty

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I felt, in your prompt public contradiction of 
the letter of Mr. Dayton, stating that my name had been withdrawn as a candidate for the Presidency, a new proof of your 
friendship, which I have ever so highly valued, and at the same 
time a self-reproach for my not having written to you since the 
adjournment of Congress. The truth is, that in the first letter 
which I received from you, after I reached home, you stated 
your intention to visit the watering places, and I did not well 
know where to address you ; and the last which you did me the 
favor to write, was received but a few days before I sat out on 
this journey. I concluded, therefore, to defer the pleasure of 
writing you until I passed the mountains. 
</p><p>
Your prediction has been well nigh verified as to General 
Jackson's taking the Western vote from me. My friends have 
prevailed over him in Ohio by only about seven or eight hundred votes. 
</p><p>
Events on this side of the mountains have surprised me, particularly in New York, and North Carolina ; in the former State 
especially. I know not the secret springs which have produced 
such a strange result as has occurred in New York. I have 
moved none of them. I know nothing but what we see in the 
public prints. From those it is evident, that, if the friends of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> and myself had all amicably co-operated, the vote 
of that State might have been secured to one or the other, or been divided between us. I am uninformed of what prevented that contest. 
</p><p>
I propose visiting <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> to-morrow, and afterward 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison</a>. I shall remain a day or two with each of them,

it unnecessary for me to say any thing in regard to Mr. Ritchie's communication about the Vice-Presidency. I have also received your obliging letter of the first instant. I had before 
learned the issue of the electoral vote of Virginia. I was prepared to expect it by all that I had previously observed. Two 
weeks ago a course might have been taken which would probably have prevented that result of the Presidential election now 
most likely to happen ; and that was to have prevailed upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> to withdraw, which might have been done, I should 
suppose, without mortification to his friends, by placing it on the 
ground of the continued precarious state of his health. As it is, 
I shall yield a cheerful acquiescence in the public decision. I 
should indeed have been highly gratified if my native State had 
thought me worthy of even a second place in her confidence and 
affection. The obligations and respect which I owe her forbid 
my uttering one word of complaint on account of her having 
thought otherwise.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, My position in relation to the friends of the 
three returned candidates is singular enough, and often to me 
very amusing. In the first place they all believe that my friends 
have the power of deciding the question, and then that I have 
the power of controlling my friends. Acting upon this supposition, in the same hour, I am sometimes touched gently on the 
shoulder by a friend, for example, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, who will 
thus address me, " My dear Sir, all my dependence is upon you, 
don't disappoint us, you know our partiality was for you next to 
the hero ; and how much we want a Western President." Immediately after a friend of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> will accost me, " The 
hopes of the Republican party are concentrated on you, for 
God's sake preserve it. If you had been returned, instead of Mr. Crawford, every man of us would have supported you to the 
last hour. We consider him and you as the only genuine Republican candidates." Next a friend of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> comes with 
tears in his eyes, " Sir, Mr. Adams has always had the greatest 
respect for you, and admiration of your talents. There is no 
station to which you are not equal. Most undoubtedly you 
are the second choice of New England, and I pray you to consider seriously whether the public good and your own future 
interests do not point most distinctly to the choice which you 
ought to make." How can one withstand all this disinterested 
homage and kindness? Really the friends of all three gentlemen are so very courteous and affectionate that I sometimes almost 
wish that it was in my power to accommodate each of them, 
but that being impossible, we are beginning to think seriously 
of the choice which we must finally make. I will tell you then 
that I believe the contest will be limited to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> personal condition precludes 
the choice of him if there were no other objection to his election. As the only alternative which is presented to us it is 
sufficiently painful, and I consider whatever choice we may 
make will be only a choice of evils. To both of those gentlemen there are strong personal objections. The principal difference between them is that in the election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> we shall 
not by the example inflict any wound upon the character of our 
institutions, but I should much fear hereafter, if not during the 
present generation, that the election of the General would give 
to the military spirit a stimulus and a confidence that might lead 
to the most pernicious results. I shall, therefore, with great regret on account of the dilemma in which the people have placed 
us, support <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. My friends are generally so inclined. 
What has great weight with me is the decided preference which 
a majority of the delegation from Ohio has for him over General 
Jackson. If, therefore, Kentucky were to vote for the General 
it would probably only have the effect of dividing our friends, 
without defeating ultimately the election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. Three 
of the four States favorable to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> are believed to prefer <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> to the General. Virginia is one of them. I am 
inclined to think that nearly three-fourths of our delegation have 
yielded to the influence of these views, and will vote for Mr. 
Adams. My friends entertain the belief that their kind wishes 
toward me will in the end be more likely to be\accomplished 
by so bestowing their votes. I have, however, most earnestly 
entreated them to throw me out of their consideration in 
bringing their judgments to a final conclusion, and to look 
and be guided solely by the public good. If I know myself, 
that alone has determined me. Your Representative is in 
clined to concur with us in these sentiments and views, and if 
they should meet your approbation, as I know he has great respect for your opinions, I would be glad if you would by the return mail address a letter to him to strengthen him in his inclination.

My dear Sir,— My position, in regard to the Presidential 
election, is highly critical, and such as to leave me no path on 
which I can move without censure. I have pursued, in regard 
to it, the rule which I always observe in the discharge of my public duty I have interrogated my conscience as to what I ought 
to do, and that faithful guide tells me that I ought to vote for 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. I shall fulfill its injunction. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> state 
of health, and the circumstances under which he presents himself to the House, appear to me to be conclusive against him. 
As a friend of liberty, and to the permanence of our institutions, 
I can not consent, in this early stage of their existence, by contributing to the election of a military chieftain, to give the 
strongest guaranty that the Republic will march in the fatal 
road which has conducted every other republic to ruin. I owe 
to our friendship this frank exposition of my intentions. I am, 
and shall continue to be, assailed by all the abuse, which partisan zeal, malignity, and rivalry, can invent. I shall risk, without emotion, these effusions of malice, and remain unshaken in 
, my purpose. What is a public man worth, if he will not expose himself, on fit occasions, for the good of his country? 
</p><p>
As to the result of the election, I can not speak with absolute 
certainty; but there is every reason to believe that we shall 
avoid the dangerous precedent to which I allude. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to give my respects to Mr. , and believe me 
</p><p>
always your cordial friend.

[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">MR. CLAY</a>] TO FRANCIS P. BLAIR. 
</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 29,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>. 
</p><p>
My DEAR Blair, I received this morning your very agreeable 
favor of the 17th instant. A letter from you is always refreshing ; and I wish that I could entitle myself to expect them more 
frequently, by more punctuality and diligence on my part in 
our correspondence. My last letter informed you of the unction that was unceasingly applied to me by all the returned candidates for the Presidency, or rather their friends. Since then 
I have avowed my intention to support <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, under actual circumstances, and thereupon the oil has been instantly 
transformed into vinegar. The friends of have turned 
upon me, and with the most amiable unanimity agree to vituperate me. I am a deserter from democracy ; a giant at intrigue ; have sold the West sold myself defeating General Jackson's election to leave open the Western pretensions that 
I may hereafter fill them myself blasting all my fair prospects, 
etc., etc. To these are added a thousand other of the most gentle and kind, and agreeable epithets and things in the world. 
</p><p>
', who are themselves straining every nerve to elect 
</p><p>
Jackson that the claims of the West may be satisfied and I be 
thereby pretermitted, are accusing me of acting on their own 
principles. The knaves can not comprehend how a man can be 
honest. They can not conceive that I should have solemnly 
interrogated my conscience and asked it to tell me seriously 
what I ought to do. That it should have enjoined me not to 
establish the dangerous precedent of elevating, in this early 
stage of the Republic, a military chieftain, merely because he 
has won a great victory? That it should have told me that a 
public man is undeserving his station who will not, regardless 
of aspersions and calumnies, risk himself for his country? I 
am afraid that you will think me moved by these abuses. Be 
not deceived. I assure you that I never in my whole life felt 
more perfect composure, more entire confidence in the resolutions of my judgment, and a more unshakable determination to 
march up to my duty. And, my dear sir, is there an intelligent 
and unbiased man who must not, sooner or later, concur with 
me? <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> you know well I should never have selected, 
if at liberty to draw from the whole mass of our citizens xor a 
President. But there is no danger in his elevation now, or in 
time to come. Not so of his competitor, of whom I can not believe that killing two thousand five hundred Englishmen at 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, qualifies for the various, difficult, and complicated 
duties of the chief magistracy. I perceive that I am unconsciously writing a sort of defense, which you may possibly thi ik 
implies guilt. What will be the result? you will ask with 
curiosity, if not anxiety. I think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> must be elected, 
such is the prevailing opinion. Still I shall not consider the matter as certain until the election is over.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your obliging letter of the 1st inst. 
Although my letter, to which it is an answer, was not intended 
for publication, I would rather that it should be published, and 
speak for itself, than that its contents should appear through the 
medium of Mr. Ritchie's representation of them. With regard to 
its publication, you will be pleased to do as you may think proper. 
All that I feel anxious about is, that the public should not receive 
an impression that it was my intention that it should be published. 
</p><p>
My condition at this moment is most peculiar. The batteries 
of some of the friends of every man who would now be President, 
or who, four or eight years hence, would be President, are directed against me, with only the exception of those of Mr. 
Adams. Some of the friends of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, and Mr. Clinton, with very different ultimate ends, agree for the present to unite in assailing me. The object now 
is, on the part of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, to drive me 
from the course Avhich my deliberate judgment points out ; and 
for the future, on the part of Mr. Clinton and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, to 
remove me as an obstacle to their elevation. They all have yet 
to learn my character if they suppose it possible to make me 
swerve from my duty, by any species of intimidation or denunciation. But I did not expect that my old friend Ritchie would 
join in the general cry. He ought to recollect that he is struggling for a man, I for the country ^he to elevate an unfortunate 
gentleman worn down by disease, I to preserve our youthful 
institutions from the bane which has destroyed all the republics 
of the old world. I might have expected, from the patriotism 
of Thomas Ritchie, that he would have surrendered his personal 
predilections, and joined with me in the effort to save us from a 
precedent fraught with the most pernicious consequences. I am 
so far disappointed : I say it with mortification and regret. But 
all attempts to make me unite with him, to induce me to give 
up the defense of our institutions, that we may elect a sick gentleman, who has also been rejected by the great body of the 
nation, are vain and utterly fruitless. Mr. Ritchie ought to 
awake, should be himself again, and love Rome more than Caesar. 
</p><p>
I observe what you kindly tell me about the future cabinet. 
My dear sir, I want no office. When have I shown an avidity 
</p><p>
for office? In rejecting the mission to Russia, and the department of war under one administration? In rejecting the same 
department; the mission to England, or any other foreign mission, 
under the succeeding administration? If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> is elected, 
I know not who will be his cabinet ; I know not whether I 
shall be offered a pladPfe in it or not. If there should be an offer, 
I shall decide upon it, when it may be made according to my 
sense of duty. But do you not perceive that this denunciation 
of me, by anticipation, is a part of the common system between 
the discordant confederates which I have above described? 
Most certainly, if an office should be offered to me under the 
new administration, and I should be induced to think that I 
ought to accept it, I shall not be deterred from accepting it, either 
by the, denunciations of open or secret enemies, or the hypocrisy 
of pretended friends.

My dear Sir, I received your letters of the 6th and 8th inst. 
In the former was inclosed a ten dollar note, about which not 
one word was contained in your letters. Was it inclosed by 
mistake? or did you intend that I should apply it to some object

</p><p>
The " long agony" was terminated yesterday, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> 
was elected on the first ballot. Exertions to defeat, and even to 
defer the result, of the most strenuous kind, were made up to the

manner in which the whole scene was exhibited in the House 
of Representatives was creditable to our institutions and to our 
country.

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, February 18,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, When the subject of the offer of the Department of State to me was first opened to my congressional friends, 
there existed among them some diversity of opinion as to the propriety of my accepting it. On the one hand, it was said that, 
if I took it, that fact would be treated as concUisive evidence of 
the justice of the imputations which have been made against 
me ; that the House of Representatives was my theater ; that 
the administration would want me there, if it should prove itself 
worthy of support, more than in the cabinet ; and that my own 
section would not like to see me translated from the legislative 
hall to the executive departments. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, it was urged that, whether I accepted or 
declined the office, I should not escape severe animadversion ; 
that, in the latter contingency, it would be said that the patriotic 
Mr. Kremer, by an exposure of the corrupt arrangement, had 
prevented its consummation ; that the very object of propagating 
the calumny would be accomplished ; that, conscious of my own 
purity of intentions, I ought not to give the weight of a feather 
to Mr. Kremer's affair ; that there would be much difficulty in 
filling the administration without me ; that either of the other 
candidates, if he had been elected, would have made me the 
same offer ; that it would be said of me that, after having contributed to the election of a President, I thought so ill of him, 
that I would not take the first place under him ; that he was 
now the constitutional head of the Government, and, as such, I 
ought to regard him, dismissing any personal objections which I 
might have heretofore had to him ; that I had, perhaps, remained 
long enough in the House of Representatives ; and that my own 
section could not be dissatisfied with seeing me placed where, 
if I should prove myself possessed of the requisite attainments, 
my services might have a more extended usefulness. 
</p><p>
On mature consideration, those of my friends who were 
originally averse to my entering the office, changed their 
opinion, and I believe they were finally unanimous in thinking 
that I ought not to hesitate in taking upon myself its duties. 
Those of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, especially in New England, were alike 
unanimous, and indeed extremely urgent in their solicitations. 
Several of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> friends (Mr. McLane, of Delaware, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a>e, Mr. Mangum, etc., etc.), and also some of those of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, in Pennsylvania, have expressed to me their 
strong convictions that I ought to accept. The opposition to 
my acceptance is limited chiefly to the violence of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>'s 
friends, and to some of those of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. 
</p><p>
From the first, I determined to throw myself into the hands 
of my friends, and if they advised me to decHne the office, not 
to accept it, but if they thought it was my duty, and for the 
public interest, to go into it, to do so. I have an unaffected repugnance to any executive employment, and my rejection of the 
offer, if it were in conformity to their deliberate judgment, would 
have been more compatible with my feelings, than its acceptance. 
</p><p>
But as their advice to me is to accept, I have resolved 
accordingly, and I have just communicated my final determination to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. I am not yet at liberty to communicate the names of the persons who will fill the other vacant 
departments ; but I will say to you, that they will be Republicans. 
I entertain a strong behef, and sanguine hopes, that the administration will be conducted upon principles which will entitle it to 
liberal and general support. An opposition is talked of here ; 
but I regard that as the ebullition of the moment, the natural 
offspring of chagrin and disappointment. There are elements 
for faction ; none for opposition. Opposition to what? To 
measures and principles which are yet to be developed ! Opposition may follow, it can not precede the unknown measures of 
administration, without incurring the denomination of faction. 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> is on his trial. Hear him, and then decide. This is 
the natural sentiment of every candid and impartial mind. He 
would not have been my President, if I had been allowed to 
range at large among the great mass of our citizens, to select a 
President ; but I was not so allowed, and circumscribed as I was, 
I thought that, under all circumstances, he was the best choice 
that I could practicably make. 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of the 16th instant, and I am happy 
to find that your better judgment points to the course which I 
am about to take. I hope that, on further reflection, my other 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> friends will probably unite in sentiment with you. 
</p><p>
This is not written for publication in whole, or in part, but I 
request you to show it to Mr. Call, Mr. Leigh, and Mr. Ritchie, 
who will have the goodness to regard it in the same confidential 
light.

My dear Sir, From your letter of the 5th instant, which I 
this day received, I perceive you are at home, and not at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, to which I had transmitted to you one of my addresses to 
my constituents. The favorable opinion entertained of it by 
such early and valuable friends as yourself and Nicholas, is highly 
gratifying. Among other similar testimonies from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, I 
have received, from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jom" rel="colleague met">Chief Justice</a>, a very satisfactory letter. 
Prior to the publication of my address, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jot" rel="colleague met">Mr. Tyler</a> wrote me a 
letter, approving of my course (since he believed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> 
to have been out of the question), and declaring, in strong terms, 
his unabated confidence in me. From all quarters, in short, 
information is constantly pouring in upon me, in every form, 
evincing general and hearty approbation of my late public 
course. My triumph will be, as it ought, complete and entire 
over the base confederacy against me. As to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsythe</a>, he certainly advised me, in unqualified terms, to accept the Department 
of State. I myself attached no particular importance to his 
opinion, though I supposed others might. He was with me on 
the 30th or 29th of last month, had a long conversation, in the 
course of which he praised my address, and, e7itre nous, gave in 
his adhesion. I have no curiosity to see his letter. I understand him thoroughly. He did not mention one word about his 
letter to you, or his correspondence with you. What could he 
say to me? 
</p><p>
I share with you in your grief for the death of Mrs. Randolph. 
I have known her from my earliest youth. She deserved all 
that you have so well said in behalf of her memory. 
</p><p>
I find my office no bed of roses. With spirits never more 
buoyant, twelve hours work per day are almost too much for my 
physical frame. An entire harmony as to public measures exists 
between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and me. 
</p><p>
I return you Nicholas' letter. 
</p><p>
P. S, Was ever any thing so silly as for Eaton to pubHsh his 
correspondence with me? I am greatly deceived if he has not 
come out worse than he stood before.

</p><p>
Sir, Having met with General Brown to-day, and fearing 
that I might not have the pleasure to see you, I requested him to 
make a communication to you respecting an incident which occurred in the President's house a few days ago. Upon calling 
at your lodgings this morning I was unfortunate in not finding 
you at them. The incident to which I allude is this : Upon 
leaving the President, with whom I had been engaged in official 
consultation, I unexpectedly met, on coming out of his receiving-room, at the door of it, in the adjoining room, General 
</p><p>
Brown, yourself, and a young gentleman, Mr. , to whom, as your aid, I was introduced by General Brown. Both the meeting and the introduction were entirely unexpected by me. Upon being presented to Mr. I walked up to him and offered him 
my hand in my usual manner, which he declined receiving. I remarked nothing offensive in his countenance, but he distinctly 
evinced an unwillingness to reciprocate that mode of salutation. 
Attaching no particular virtue to the touch of his hand, I turned 
off and left the room. Upon reflection on the occurrence, it appeared to me that if the young gentleman designed an affront to 
a total stranger, he could not have possibly selected an apartment 
of the President's house, at the very door of his receiving-room, 
and within the hearing, if not in the view, of the Chief Magistrate, to give the affront. I had a right, therefore, to conclude 
that he had some cutaneous disease with which he was unwilling to infect me, or that, as he kept his hand inclosed in his 
coat or waistcoat, that some newly-established etiquette forbade 
the ancient and unfashionable mode of salutation. But on my 
return from the office to my lodgings yesterday afternoon, I perceived your visiting-card, unaccompanied by that of any other 
person ; from which I have supposed that I may have misconceived the intentions of Mr. and that he really meditated offering me an insult. Upon that supposition this note is addressed to you, with the sole object that you may impress upon 
the member of your family, to whom I refer, the utility of the observance of urbanity as a necessary part of that discipline for 
which the American army, generally, is so eminently distinguished.

My dear Sir, I have just received your favor of the 2Tth. 
1 aid not know that the extract published by Mr. Pleasants was 
from a letter written by you. The same thing has been told 
to me by several, and, among others, by Mr. Wilson Allen, of 
the Bowling Green, and Colonel H. Mercer. I think you ought 
to take no notice of the contradiction of Mr. Ritchie. Your 
name is not before the public as the writer of the letter. If it 
were, you might be considered as pledged to sustain the assertion. 
Mr. Allen told me that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> warmest friends in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, after seeing him, admitted his incompetency for the

From all quarters, the testimony which I get, public and private, of the public approbation of my late conduct, is full, complete, and triumphant. They are preparing in Kentucky to give 
me an enthusiastic reception. But you see they will not let me 
alone. Ingham has just made his appearance, and I wish he 
would write by the league instead of the yard. The next shot 
will be from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gmd" rel="colleague met">McDuffie</a>, or from Nashville, or from both.

My dear Sir, I received your kind letter of the 29th ultimo, 
and thank you for the friendly expression of sympathy which it 
contains. Our late affliction* was rendered still more severe by 
the circumstances under which it occurred. I did not yield to 
the urgent calls of duty here, until I had the strongest assurances 
from the attending physician that there was no danger. And, 
after leaving Lebanon, the first information I received of the sad 
event which occurred there, reached me, when I was within 
about twenty miles of this place, through the " Intelligencer." 
</p><p>
I received, perused, and now retain Judge Duval's letter. His 
wishes in behalf of his son will be considered ; but the fact that 
he has one son a governor under the general Government and 
another holding a captain's commission (this latter now applying 
for another appointment), will operate somewhat against his success. 
</p><p>
You must feel gratified that our old friend Troop has finally 
concluded to abstain from surveying the Creek lands, and of 
course that all danger is dissipated of disturbing the public peace.

If Virginia is to designate a Senator upoi\ the principle of 
opposition to the administration, let that Senator be Mr. B. Giles. 
He would be a real friend, though a nominal enemy. I mean 
that his indiscretions, always great, and now greater than ever, 
would benefit more than his hostility would injure. But I 
should hope that no such principle would govern the choice. I 
should be delighted to see Governor Pleasants here, or General 
Tucker, or Mr. C. Johnson. Of the latter I know personally 
but little ; but the accounts I have always had of him are highly 
favorable. It is of no great consequence, in respect to the success or movement of the Administration, who may be sent. The 
judgment which the public will form of it, depends upon its 
measures. And one Senator out of forty-eight can not, in that 
view of the matter, be very essential. You will hear with 
pleasure, that our harmony, in the cabinet, continues without 
the slightest interruption, and that we have daily testimonies 
of increased strength and confidence. 
</p><p>
The President has acceded to the wishes of several of the 
new American Republics, that the United States should be represented at Panama. Our friends need have no fears of our 
contracting there unnecessary or onerous engagements, or menacing the peace or neutrality of the country. 
</p><p>
There is a treaty now going on in this city with the Creeks, 
with prospects of a successful issue.

therefore indulge the hope of a speedy return to health. 
</p><p>
As to the Panama mission, it has encountered much delay and 
a good deal of opposition in the Senate, owing principally to the 
actual composition of that body at present. There are some 
fifteen or sixteen Senators determined to oppose the administration at all events, and that measure especially. There are eight 
or ten others whose private feelings are inimical, but who are 
restrained by the state of things at their respective homes. When 
these eight or ten unite (and they are disposed to lend to the 
regulars of opposition all the collateral countenance they can, 
without committing themselves), with the others, together they 
form a majority. The delay which has occurred in the Panama 
affair has been produced by a majority thus compounded ; and 
the expedients to which it has resorted, to procrastinate the decision, will surprise the country, if it is ever allowed to know 
them. Nevertheless, it is confidently believed that a majority 
of the Senate will finally oppose the mission. It is understood 
they are to act on it to-day, and they may probably get through 
it this week, though that is by no means certain. In the House, 
and with the country, the administration need not desire to be 
stronger than it is. As to the peculiar condition, at this time, 
of the Senate, you can well imagine the cause.

My DEAR Sir, I duly received your kind letter of the 12th 
instant. Prior to my going out on the affair to which it refers, 
the only letter I wrote about it was addressed to you, and put 
into the hands of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">General Harrison</a>, to be forwarded on a contingency which did not happen. In that letter, which he still 
retains, I briefly assigned the reasons which determined me on 
the course I took. The circumstances which most embarrassed 
me was the opinion which is entertained by some, as to the state 
of Mr. Randolph's mind. But I thought I ought not to be governed by that opinion which was opposed by the recent act of 
my native State electing him to the Senate. As for the future, it must be left to itself. Most certainly I should reluctantly engage in any similar affair. 
</p><p>
Will you not come and see us this session? I should be glad 
if you would come up and pass some days at my house. On 
Wednesday next I expect some company to dine with me, as I 
generally do on that day of every week. Suppose you be of the 
party, and take your lodgings with me? My family is very 
small, and we have several spare bed-rooms.

My dear Sir, My visit home has been altogether highly 
gratifying. Far from any abatement, there is an increase in the 
number and ardor of my friends, who have given me the strongest testimonies of their attachment. From Missouri I learn that 
Scott's prospect of re-election is promising. Cook's is unattended with any doubt. Senator Reed writes me from Mississippi in 
great confidence of his re-election, upon the distinct ground of 
supporting the Administration. In Ohio and Indiana things could 
not look better. I think we may assume, first, that the Western 
States, whose delegation voted for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, will continue to 
support him ; and secondly, that Mississippi will probably be added 
to the number. You will have heard of Gurley's re-election,

</p><p>
I shall set out on the 11th for  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> via Kanawba. I 
go that route to take advantage of the Virginia Springs, to improve my health, which just begins to feel the benefit of absence

My dear Sir, I arrived without accident the day before 
yesterday, and after remaining about a week at it, for the use of 
the mineral waters, I propose resuming my journey about the 
1st of September, and hope to reach the city the 10th or 12th. 
My health has improved on the journey, although I have not 
been able to secure all the tranquillity and abstraction from 
crowds which is necessary to its re-establishment ; for they 
have invited me to a public dinner at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lewisburg" rel="city">Lewisburg</a>, and not being 
able to assign any sufficient reason for declining it, I have accepted it. The administration has many friends in this quarter 
of Virginia. 
</p><p>
There is much company at this place, but it shifts as frequently as the dramatis personse of a theater. It is chiefly from 
the Southern States. 
</p><p>
I am driving a gig-horse, which, though not so fine or showy 
as your finest carriage-horse, I am inclined to think might answer as a tolerable match for him. 
</p><p>
With my best regards to Mrs. Johnston, and the hope of seeing you both very soon, I am truly your friend.

My DEAR Sir, I have occasion for all possible indulgence from my friends, on account of my irregularity in acknowledging 
and answering their esteemed favors. They will do me great wrong, if, in any case, they attribute my silence to insensibility 
to the value of their letters. I perceive from yours of the 7th inst., that you feel that I had neglected answering some of your 
prior letters. I must plead guilty, and ask for mercy. I am glad to learn that the message takes well at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, or rather, that 
it is only objected to because it is without fault. Political prospects are good every where, to the North, East and West, and I 
think less gloomy in the South. In Kentucky, an Adams representative has been sent from one of the two Jackson districts, 
vacated by the death of their members, and my confidence in the support of that State to the administration, and in the reelection of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> is entire. In Pennsylvania, the Governor comes out in his message in support of the administration, and 
sanctioning the late election of President. In New York, the 
great body of both parties is with us, and I verily believe that if 
the electoral law should even remain unaltered, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> will obtain every vote. 
</p><p>
I invite your attention to the documents (of which I will forward a copy by the mail), concerning the colonial question. I 
think we have put Great Britain unquestionably in the wrong.

My dear Sir, I have yielded to the wish that I should write 
in behalf of Mr. Taylor, but a great deal too much weight is 
attributed to my recommendation, and I fear that the bank will 
hardly be prevailed on to deviate from their practice of sending 
out a cashier educated under their own eye. 
</p><p>
From all recent indications at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, we are to conclude 
that Mr. Ritchie has succeeded in putting a majority of the General Assembly in the honor of a permanent opposition to the 
general administration. I regret it extremely, not more on our 
account here, than on that of Virginia herself. It is consoling 
that every where else, things are going well, and the final issue 
is perfectly certain. Mr. McKinley, the new Senator lately 
elected in Alabama, is believed to have brought with him good 
dispositions toward the Administration. In that branch of Congress where it was weakest, it is now entirely safe.

My dear Sir, I duly received your favor of the 24th instant. 
You will have since seen the late Convention with England, 
which has been communicated to Congress, and published. A 
great and somewhat general mistake has prevailed in respect to 
the extent of the claim which existed on Great Britain, on account of slaves, and other property, taken away or destroyed. 
The claim, on the part of American citizens, arises out of the 
fiirst article of the Treaty of Ghent, which stipulates, " All territory, places, and possessions, whatsoever, taken by either party 
from the other, during the war, or which may be taken after 
signing this treaty, excepting only the islands hereinafter mentioned, shall be restored without delay, and without causing any 
destruction, or carrying away any of the artillery, or other public property, originally captured in the said forts or places, and 
which shall remain therein upon the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, or any slaves, or other private property." The parties differed about the meaning of this clause, and referred 
their dispute to the Emperor Alexander. He decided it in favor 
of the United States, and a Tripartite Convention was concluded 
at St. Petersburg, to give effect to this decision. The mixed 
commission (composed of Messrs. Jackson and Cheves), was created to execute that commission ; but they could not agree, and the late Convention, by which the United States agree to accept, 
in behalf of the claimants, a gross sum, was substituted to the commission. 
</p><p>
Now it is evident, from this narrative, that the new Convention could only provide for that class of complainants who were comprehended in the first article of the Treaty of Ghent. Government, in fact, was only an agent or trustee for that class. If you go back beyond the Treaty of Ghent, perhaps one class of 
persons who had their property taken away or destroyed, during 
the late war, has as much equity as another. But the treaty 
did not provide for any but one class. To that limited extent. 
Great Britain has always been dissatisfied with the stipulation 
and the interpretation put upon it. Government, now, can do no 
more than see that the class provided for shall have the benefit 
of a most fortunate provision made for them in the treaty. It 
can not undertake to divide a fund, intended exclusively for that 
class, among those who are, unfortunately, not comprehended 
in the Treaty of Ghent. If it were to go out of the treaty, where 
would be the stopping-place? 
</p><p>
A board will probably be created by Congress, during the 
present session, but its duty will be restricted to a fair execution 
of the Treaty of Ghent, the Imperial decision, and the late Convention. The average value fixed by the mixed commission, 
and the definitive list sent to it from the Department of State, 
in pursuance of the Convention at St. Petersburg, will govern 
the new Board ; and it will belong to that to decide, under the 
limitations stated, upon all cases thus presented to it, and upon 
the sufficiency of the evidence by which they are made out. 
</p><p>
Should there be a surplus in the fund, Congress alone possesses the power to dispose of it.

My dear Sir, I send by this mail the copies of the British 
Acts of Parliament desired. 
</p><p>
It is a subject of deep regret with me (and I beg you to say 
so to Governor Tyler) that his friendly letter to me, on the occasion of my vote in the House of Representatives, on the late 
Presidential election, should have been used to assail or annoy 
him. In any casual allusion which I ever made to that letter, it 
was far from my intention that it should have been made instrumental to his prejudice. The truth is, that it is one of a 
hundred similar letters which I received, about the period of its 
date, from all quarters of the Union, and from some of the most 
distinguished men in it. I have heard that the letter was inadvertently (and certainly with no unfriendly purpose toward the 
Governor) spoken of by a Mr. Clarke, a lawyer of Winchester, 
who had been, a few days before, with me, and to whom I expressed, what I certainly felt, much gratification with his election, 
and stated that I had the satisfaction to believe that Governor 
Tyler did justice to the motives which had influenced me on the 
above memorable occasion, as he had addressed to me, at the 
time, a letter couched in the most friendly terms. I understand 
that Mr. Clarke incidentally spoke of this conversation, not recollecting that a printer was by, who felt himself at liberty to make 
the matter a topic in his next paper. 
</p><p>
"Whether it was in this way or not that it got out, I can not 
tell. It may have been in some other manner ; for there is an 
espionage prevailing which spares no privacy, and which, unless 
checked, must destroy all confidence. 
</p><p>
Tell the Governor that he must not take the matter much at 
heart ; to recollect how much I have borne, and with what philosophy and fortitude. Tell him, moreover, that we shall certainly prevail, and that I do not even despair of our native State. 
When he comes here, no one entertains the idea that he will 
renounce any of the great principles of his public action, and 
least of all, that by which he judges of men and things as they 
are, and not as passion, party, or prejudice may represent them.

My dear Sir, The volume of the British Acts of PaiHament, 
containing those which <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> desires, is in possession 
of the clerk of the House of Representatives. We have not 
been able to get it back, and I fear may not in time for the use 
of the General. But if I can regain it, I will send it by mail 
for his use. 
</p><p>
I do not wish you to write to Governor Tyler. It will do to 
speak to him when you see him, I should regret very much if 
he feels hurt about the letter. I can only repeat, that any allusion which I made to it in conversation was far from any design 
to prejudice him, or any expectation that it should get into the 
pubhc prints. I hope, on the other hand, that he has not permitted himself to attribute to me the violation of any confidential correspondence. His letter had nothing confidential in it. 
It was public in its nature, public topics were treated of, and it 
was addressed to a public man. It was spontaneous, and therefore more prized by me. We have no news.

I will attend to your wish about the note to your speech, so far 
 
</p><p>
as it is practicable. Since you left us, the city has been very

as to ultimate success, about which, I think, they can hardly be 
mistaken. The developments of the " Intelligencer" have produced great effect in that quarter, and from other parts of Pennsylvania than those which you visited, our information still runs 
in a favorable current. They tell this anecdote of Buchanan. 
At a tavern in Harrisburg, where he was electioneering, he remarked that he " had heard much of changes from Jackson to 
Adams, but could see nobody that had changed." A member

My dear Sir, I took the liberty of sending you a few days 
ago, a copy of some speeches, etc., of mine, which have been 
recently published in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and which I hope you will 
have safely received. 
</p><p>
Have you read the accounts about the execution of the six 
militia-men at Mobile, early in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>? I think the Nashville 
Committee are entitled to the public thanks for bringing that 
matter to light. I had a vague impression about it, but I had 
really put it in the large class of doubtful reports. The Committee have undeceived me ; and I think if they favor the public with many more similar disclosures, they will serve most 
effectually the cause they have espoused. What has become of 
the eloquent pen of Algernon Sidney? I think the case of 
 
</p><p>
these poor deluded militia-men furnishes a theme on which it 
might be employed with as much instruction and benefit as when 
it was formerly exercised with such powerful influence.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, June 4,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1827">1827</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, Long accustomed to regard you as one of the 
fathers of the Republican church, to which we both belong, I 
hope I shall be excused from that circumstance, if I am not authorized by our acquaintance, in taking the liberty of addressing 
this letter to you. 
</p><p>
You have felt too deep an interest and had too much agency 
in the public aflairs of our country to admit of your beholding 
with indifference what is now passing, or to allow you to forbear from giving, while you are spared among us, the benefit 
of your matured counsels. And I am greatly mistaken in the 
estimate I have made of your judgment and character, if you 
can approve the conduct of the opposition to the General Administration, or the object, or the means which they are employing to accomplish that object, of supplanting <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> 
and electing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. 
</p><p>
During the administration of the father of our present Chief 
Magistrate, I was too young and too poor to take any part in the 
public councils ; but I, nevertheless, had very decided opinions, 
to which I gave all the effect I could in private circles, against 
some of the prominent measures of that administration, and 
what I believed to be its tendency, if not the ultimate aim of 
some of its principal supporters. But I could not allow myself 
to transfer my dislike of the Administration of the father to the 
person and public character of the son, who, I firmly believe, 
after an acquaintance with him of more than twenty years, to 
be sincerely attached to our free institutions, and to the general 
cause of liberty. When, therefore, the only alternative presented, on a late occasion, to my choice in the House of Representatives, was between him and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, who appeared 
to me to possess no other than military pretensions, I could not 
doubt the side on which duty and safety lay. Far from regretting the choice which I then made, I should make it again, under 
similar circumstances, and I must ever think that the election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> at that or any other time, would be a most 
unfortunate event for this country. I accepted a place in the 
Administration from a full conviction that it was a duty I owed 
myself, after the flagitious attacks made upon me, one object of 
which was to intimidate me, and under the unanimous advice 
of all my Congressional friends. 
</p><p>
If there be one characteristic which, more than any other, 
distinguishes the Republican party, and of which, more than any 
other, they may be justly proud, it is their devotion to liberty and 
to the guarantees for its preservation which experience and reason 
demonstrate to be necessary. Does not the history of all nations and of all times prove, that the greatest danger to freedom 
is from mere military men? With this light before them, can 
the Republican party, if they are faithful to their own principles, and desirous to perpetuate to their posterity that liberty 
which they themselves enjoy, lend themselves to the election of 
a chief magistrate, who possesses no other qualification than 
that of being a successful military commander? I thought they 
could not, and yet believe that they can not. 
</p><p>
It would be a great satisfaction to me to find that the opinions 
which I have now expressed receive your approbation. But 
whether I am so fortunate or not, I hope you will do justice to 
my motives in communicating them, and in addressing you at 
the present period, and at the same time be fully persuaded that 
I have the greatest respect and veneration for your character.

My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 2d instant. You 
ask me if I am going to Kentucky soon, and if I can be spared. 
I am compelled by my private business, and particularly by that 
of the estate of my deceased friend. Colonel Morrison, of which 
I am the only acting executor, to go to Kentucky, and I shall 
leave this city for that purpose on the 10th instant. It is my intention to return by the 1st of August. I shall leave the business 
of the Department in such condition, that I do not believe that 
any prejudice to the public will arise from my absence.

1 hope you are not mistaken in the good effect of my  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> speech. Mr. Buchanan has presented his communication to 
the public ; and although he evidently labors thronghoat the 
whole of it to spare and cover <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, he fails in every 
essential particular to sustain the General. Indeed, I could not 
desire a stronger statement from Mr. Buchanan. The tables are 
completely turned upon the General. Instead of any intrigues 
on my part and that of my friends, they were altogether on the 
side of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> and his friends. But I will ' leave the 
statement to your own reflections. I directed a copy to be inclosed yesterday to Mr. Southard. It must confirm any good 
impression produced by my speech. 
</p><p>
Tell Mr. Southard that his children are much better, and that 
he need not entertain any fear about them.

With my best wishes that you may both realize much benefit 
from the mineral waters.

My DEAR Sir, We have only imperfect accounts from some 
of the Congressional districts in Kentucky. These authorize 
the belief that Metcalf, Trimble, and Clarke are re-elected. 
And so far as I learn, the Administration tickets have generally prevailed in their districts. Captain Byers appears to 
have declined, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Beatty</a> and Morris were elected without any 
great struggle. The inclosed letter from Mr. Robertson, late 
</p><p>
Speaker of the House of Representatives, on his return home 
from Harrisburg, would justify the hope that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crittenden</a> is 
elected, and Mr. Walton defeated by the Administration candidate in his district ; but I do not think we ought yet to count 
upon these auspicious results. 
</p><p>
The city has been extremely hot since you left us ; but, for 
the last two days, the heat has been tempered by misty weather. 
I think you have made a lucky escape. I should find it very 
lonesome, if the occupations of business did not constantly engage me. 
</p><p>
My best respects to Mrs. Johnston ; and I pray you also to 
communicate them to Mr. and Mrs. Madison, and to Mrs. Cutts.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, I received yesterday your letter of the 23d instant. 
After its date you must have received other dispatches from the 
Department of State, transmitted by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alg" rel="colleague met">Mr. Gallatin</a>. From them 
you will perceive that he did not take the two points, proposed by 
the British plenipotentiaries, for reference to his Government, but 
for his own consideration (see his dispatch No. 87), and that he 
afterward decided to reject them, and gave to the British plenipotentiaries two written arguments, one relating to the point respecting the Commercial Convention, and the other to that respecting the North-western Boundary (see his dispatch No. 88). 
In this state of the case the matter stands. It does not appear 
that the British plenipotentiaries had, in consequence of that determination of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alg" rel="colleague met">Mr. Gallatin</a>, refused to renew the Convention of 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a> ; but that, on the contrary, they had again taken the subject of the North-western Boundary into consideration. So the 
affair, I understand, was left on the 14th of July,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1827">1827</a>, when 
Mr. Huskisson was compelled, by indisposition, to withdraw from 
the negotiation. It was expected that Mr. Grant would be substituted for him (see <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alg" rel="colleague met">Mr. Gallatin</a>'s dispatch No. 96). 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, shall I instruct <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alg" rel="colleague met">Mr. Gallatin</a> to accede to the British demands on the two points referred to? I 
shall await your further directions, founded on the dispatches 
which must have been received by you subsequent. to the date 
of your letter. Shall I confer with the other members of the 
Administration who may be here? 
</p><p>
I am inclined to think that the British Government may waive 
both points. I should be sorry that the negotiation should break 
off on these points, but there will be still another year to go upon. 
As to the discrimination between rolled and hammered iron, I 
am inclined to think the weight of the argument is with the 
British ; but Congress has at least twice decided otherwise. 
You will recollect Mr. Baldwin's argument, which, however, I 
think, was refuted by that of Mr. S. Canning. 
</p><p>
On the other point, we should, by consenting to the restraint 
which the British Government wishes to impose against our 
military occupation of any part of the territory on the north-west 
coast, come into direct collision with the House of Representatives. What shall we lose if that part of the Convention is not 
renewed? What danger shall we encounter? None, unless 
from our own acts. What shall we gain by the renewal with 
the British modification? What danger avoid? None. We 
shall only have tied those hands by a treaty, which we may keep 
still without it. And it will be the Executive who will have 
co-operated in fastening the hands of Congress. 
</p><p>
I do not think that we ought to be hastening any settlements 
beyond the Rocky Mountains. We ought to do nothing more, 
in my opinion, there than may be necessary to preserve our 
rights for posterity.

Sir, Mr. Wheaton having delivered to me this day a letter

your belief be well-founded or not, in each of the cases therein

Stated, I take much pleasure in saying, First, that I have no 
recollection of having hefore or since the month of December,

injurious in their consequences with regard to you ; Secondly, 
that I am fully persuaded you labor under an entire mistake in 
supposing that, by any expressions or representations of mine, 
the Department of War was induced to adopt a line of conduct 
in respect to you which defeated the object of your mission to 
Florida last winter. I had no agency in your appointment, nor 
had I any thing to do with the relations which subsequently 
arose between the Department of War and yourself. I remember to have heard with satisfaction of the appointment about the 
time it was made, and I assure you that I could not possibly 
have entertained any other wish in regard to your mission, but 
that it should have been attended with full success ; and. Thirdly, so far from being the author of the piece to which I understand you to refer, in the " National Journal," of the 25th ult. 
(the piece under the editorial head), I had not even read it, until 
since I have received your note. The paper is generally left at 
my house before breakfast, and I do generally throw my eye 
over it, but the number containing the article in question, was 
either not left as usual, or was not seen by me.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, A speech of Mr. Senator Branch, of North Carolina (of which I transmit you a copy herewith), has been recently published as having been delivered by that gentleman on 
the occasion of the Senate's confirmation of my nomination to 
the office which I now hold. It is brought forward to impugn 
a statement contained in a speech which I delivered in July 
last, at Noble's, near  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. In the course of an argument, 
wfiich I urged against the improbability of any such overtures 
having been made, as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> stated himself to have 
received from my friends, I contended that if ^hey had been received, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> was bound, when, as a Senator of the 
United States, he was required to act upon the nomination, to 
have disclosed them to the Senate, and to have moved the ap
pointment of a Committee of Inquiry ; and that it was especially 
incumbent on him to have adopted that course, as it did not 
then appear that any other Senator knew of the alleged overtures. 
I observed that I had requested a Senator of the United States, 
when my nomination should be taken up, to ask of the Senate 
the appointment of such a committee, unless it should appear 
to him to be altogether unnecessary ; and I added that I was 
afterward informed, " that when it was acted upon. General 
Jackson, and every other Senator present, were silent as to the 
imputations now made ; no one presuming to question my honor 
or integrity." 
</p><p>
Although it can not be regarded as material to the validity of 
the argument, as urged against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, whether Mr. 
Branch did or did not make a speech in opposition to my appointment, I am desirous that in the statement of any matter of fact 
made by me, even on a collateral or unimportant point, there 
should be perfect accuracy ; or that, if a mistake has been committed, it should be rectified. You will, I think, recollect, that 
I desired you, as my friend, with much earnestness, to ask from 
the Senate the appointment of a Committee of Investigation into 
INIr. Kremer's charge, if, from the course the nomination should 
take in the Senate, it should appear to you to be at all necessary ; 
that you afterward informed me that nothing had occurred to 
render the appointment of such a committee necessary, and that 
you had, therefore, forbore to ask it. The Senate acted, as 
usual, with closed doors, and, consequently, no one was present 
but the members and the officers of the body. The injunction 
of secrecy was removed after the decision upon the nomination. 
</p><p>
After the publication of my speech at Noble's, upon seeing a 
statement in some of the public prints that Mr. Branch had addressed some observations to the Senate, in opposition to my 
nomination, an indistinct recollection occurred to me that you 
did inform me that no Senator but Mr. Branch had said any 
thing on the subject of my appointment ; that he made a few 
remarks, which were but little attended to, and which appeared 
to produce no impression. I think you did not state, particularly, what they were, for, I am quite sure, if you had mentioned 
that Mr. Branch had assigned the reasons which he now puts 
forward, a more distinct and durable impression would have been 
made on my mind. It would, however, have been too late, at 
that time, for me to have applied to the Senate for the appoint 
</p><p>
ment of a committee, if I had even thought it to be necessary, 
as the Senate had finally acted upon the nomination. 
</p><p>
My object in addressing this letter to you being to obtain 
from you a statement, according to your recollection, of the 
above transactions, so far as you had an agency in them, I shall 
be very much obliged to you to furnish me with a reply as soon 
as may be convenient.

Dear Sir, I have received your favor of yesterday, and 
thank you for the agreeable intelligence which it communicates. 
If we can succeed in the coming Maryland elections, in the Delaware election, and in that in the city of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, our cause 
wi]l again be put in good heart. From Kentucky my late information is more encouraging. The partial defeat in the Congressional elections has aroused our friends, and they think it will 
ultimately have a good effect. Letcher says he is more confident than ever of our cause prevailing. I think the exultation 
on the one side, and the depression on the other, will be found 
to be without any sufficient ground, and that it will be temporary. 
</p><p>
I am glad that you conversed with Markley. It may be

though I think that not necessary till we hear from the Hermitage. At the last date I saw from Nashville, Buchanan's statement had just reached there.

My dear Sir, I received your obliging favor of the 21st instant, with its inclosure. Mr. Southard on his return from the 
Springs, brought home with him high spirits and good health, 
and communicated to me all interesting occurrences on his journey. The result of the Kentucky elections, though in some 
respects to be regretted, ought not to be regarded in the discouraging light in which it is. It should be recollected that 
they took place before Mr. Buchanan's statement reached the 
State, and before the extensive circulation of the spe'ech which 
you and Mr. S. too highly extolled. Many local and other causes 
had also an inauspicious effect, which it is believed will not 
operate in future. Notwithstanding all circumstances the Legislature, in both of its branches, is decidedly friendly to the Administration, and of those who actually voted for members of 
Congress, there is a considerable majority for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. This 
happened by the Jackson members being elected, in several instances by small majorities, and the Adams, either without competition, or by large majorities. My letters speak with good 
confidence on the final vote of the State. Mr. Letcher writes 
that his confidence is greater now than ever. 
</p><p>
As to Mr. Ritchie's boastful statement, that is all a 7'use de 
guerre. My belief is that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> will be re-elected and 
with ease. I speak of course with all the diffidence which one 
ought to feel when expressing himself on such a subject. It is 
a part of the system of the friends of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> to make 
demonstrations speak boldly claim every body and every 
State, and carry the election by storm. The circumstance most 
to be deprecated is that this system has too much success in dispiriting our friends. You ask my opinion as to the project of a 
convention in Virginia to nominate, in January next, electors 
for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. It appears to me to be an excellent project, and 
one that can not fail to have good effect, even if it should not 
succeed. It will take by its novelty, and it will command respect by its fairness. 
</p><p>
There is a great portion (I believe a majority) of the population of Virginia opposed to the domination of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> 
party. That majority is kept down by the principle of representation, according to territorial division, instead of population. 
The election of electors is the only election in Virginia in which 
that principle does not prevail, and in which the decision is according to numbers, without regard to counties. There is reason 
to believe that the greatest strength of the Administration in 
Virginia is where there are the greatest numbers, and consequently it will be manifested in the vote for electors. This is, 
or will be known, and the desire of pulling down the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> influence will stimulate many to the greatest exertion, and 
may operate, in numerous instances, to induce men to discard 
their preference for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, in order to defeat the party 
of the metropolis. In every view of the matter I think it of the 
first importance to push the plan. You are to have the first 
meeting, I understand, at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, There should be 
great exertion to make it respectable. So matters strike me. I 
thank you for the opportunity of perusing my letter of 4th 
February,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>. I think its publication would have good effect. 
Perhaps it had better be deferred a little while. You could take 
it with you to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> ; show it to Pleasants, and he could, 
at a proper time, publish it by your permission. When published, 
it ought to be accompanied with the explanation of the first 
paragraph ; that my letter to you of the 28th January,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a> (the 
letter referred to in that paragraph) had found its way into the 
" Enquirer" where it was not correctly represented, owing, no 
doubt, to the erroneous information of its contents received by 
the editor ; that you wrote to me expressing regret that it had 
been the subject of newspaper animadversion, and hence my 
letter of the 4th February. I return the letter, having retained 
a copy. Are you coming here, as Southard (now absent) told 
me was possible? or are you going shortly from home? If you 
come, pray come at once to my house, where there is always a 
bed for you. I have been a little indisposed ; and I have some 
thoughts of an excursion of a week or ten days, to get out of 
the dust of the office and the smoke of the city. I know not 
whether I shall be able to get off ; but if I do, I have a thought 
of a little tour, first to Harper's Ferry, and then round by Mr. 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="">Monroe's</a>, and probably to your house. I beg you not to mention my visit in this respect first, because I do not know that I 
can execute it ; and second, if I should, I desire to go as much 
incog, as possible.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received your favor of the 20th inst., 
and most truly do I participate in the wish which it expresses, 
that it was practicable for us to have a personal interview. 
</p><p>
On the affair of the V. P., it was understood at the last session, that at the one novv?" near at hand the friends of the Administration should bring together and compare the public opinion 
prevailing in the respective quarters of the country, as to the 
proper individual to be selected, and that measures should then 
be adopted to give effect to it. As for myself, I have no wish 
one way or the other about it, so far as I am personally concerned. 
</p><p>
On the subject touched in your letter the propriety of an address from the Convention about to assemble at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> ^I 
concur with you entirely as to its expediency. The occasion 
calls for it. It will be expected from the enlightened men there 
assembled. And the public will be disappointed if it be not 
able, patriotic, and striking. There are so many members of the 
Convention more competent than I am to suggest what should 
be its character and its contents, that I will only barely take the 
liberty of hinting, that it should make a peaceful appeal to the 
</p><p>
uniform devotion of Virginia to the cause of human liberty, and 
to the providing of all possible guarantees of its preservation. 
</p><p>
Then I should think you might awaken the magnanimity of 
Virginia, She has had four Presidents ; the North but two. 
</p><p>
Is it not her true interest to evince that she is not actuated 
by selfish ambition? 
</p><p>
The influence of Virginia can only be preserved in this Union 
by numbers or by moral power. The first she has not. The 
last she has ; and what augmentation of it would she not produce, by making the present generation feel, and posterity own, 
that she had thrown herself into the military crevasse which is 
letting in a fatal current, threatening to sweep all before it? 
Should the election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> be secured by the aid of Virginia, to her weight distinctly would it be attributed. She 
would then be the primary power. 
</p><p>
These hints are respectfully suggested. They might be 
much extended ; but I have neither time to enlarge them, or to 
throw them into the form of a regular composition. I am acquainted with Mr. Semple. He is ardent in the cause, but 
thinks that he can aid more effectually by indirect than direct exertion.

Dear Sir, Shortly after my arrival in this city in the fall

the session, I conversed with you freely on the subject of the 
Presidential election more than once. I think one of these conversations was after I had seen <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, on whom I called 
the next day after that on which I reached the city. In the 
course of these conversations I fully expressed to you my views

upon to decide between them. I shall be greatly obliged if you 
would state, in writing, the purport of these conversations, or of 
any other which I had with you in November or December,

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, November 29, ISSY. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I have to thank you for Mr. Giles' book, and 
him for writing it. I care not how widely he diffuses my 
Tariff speech. I believe its principles will stand the test of 
the severest scrutiny. I hope, however, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> 
will now publish his speech. I understood from him that he 
had come under some promise to do so. 
</p><p>
The two parties are beginning to assemble in great numbers, 
and we shall, doubtless, have a full house on the election of a 
Speaker. The contest will be close, and if luck did not seem 
to be running somewhat against us at this particular period, I 
should say Mr. Taylor will be chosen. 
</p><p>
The rumor of the day is that Chilton is elected in Kentucky 
by twenty- seven votes.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, I received your favor of the 2d instant. Mr. Sergeant informed me that he would, in answer to a letter from 
Mr. Call, put your Committee in correspondence with the contemplated convention at Harrisburg, etc. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pbp" rel="colleague friend met">General P. B. Porter</a>, 
who, as a member of the Legislature, will be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> from the 
first of next month to some time in April, and will be a very 
suitable person to correspond with. I will obtain some other 
names hereafter. 
</p><p>
We were beaten in the Speaker's election. The truth is, that 
Mr. Taylor was heavy to carry, and the burden could not be 
well thrown off. Had some person been run on our side free 
from the objections applicable to him, the difference would not 
have been greater than two or three votes, but would still, perhaps, have been against us. Now that the Opposition have obtained the Speaker, I suspect that both he and they are greatly 
embarrassed as to the use which ought to be made of their triumph. If an opposition complexion is given to the committees, 
they assume all the responsibility of public measures. If another 
character is stamped upon them, it will be a virtual admission 
that no change of measures is desirable. 
</p><p>
If any allusion is made in the public prints to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsj" rel="colleague friend met">Mr. Johnston's</a>
favorable opinion of the Panama mission, I hope the fact will be 
put on incontestible ground.

My dear Sir, I am sorry to learn that you are indisposed 
and suflering much pain from a swelled knee ; but I hope you 
will soon get over it. 
</p><p>
1 congratulate you on the proceedings of your Convention. I 
was particularly gratified that you were made its President. £ 
hear the most flattering accounts of the address to the people 
which the Convention has adopted. Although I am eager to see 
it, I have not yet had an opportunity of perusing it. But I am 
prepared, in advance, to make my grateful acknowledgments for 
the friendly notice which is taken of me. I am rendered quite 
happy by the kind feelings which have been cotemporaneously 
expressed toward me by my native and adopted State. 
</p><p>
The address of the Convention in the latter, I send you herewith, and after you have done with it I will thank you to hand it

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I have duly received your favor of the 14th 
instant, prior to which I addressed a short letter to you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. 
</p><p>
The proceedings of your Convention have been seen here 
with the greatest satisfaction. They are all marked by wisdom 
and discretion. The address is admired by every body, and 
fully realizes the high expectation which we formed when it was 
understood who was to compose it. 
</p><p>
The duty assigned you as to the communication to Messrs. 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Madison</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="">Monroe</a>, is very delicate ; but it appears to me that, 
by giving them beforehand sufficient notice of your intention 
hereafter to make an official communication to them, you have 
adopted the most prudent course. I am apprehensive that they 
will decline, which I should very much regret. If they do, it 
will be very desirable that it should not be done in such manner 
as to injure our cause. 
</p><p>
Oiir news from the West is very cheering. Ohio is beyond 
all doubt safe. So is Indiana, and I think Illinois. Oar friends 
in Kentucky are very confident of success, as is exhibited by a 
proposition in the Legislature, proceeding from them, for a general ticket. It was not decided when I last heard from Frankfort, 
</p><p>
Southard has just returned from Annapolis. I have not yet 
seen him.

</p><p>
My dear Sib, I am sorry to learn by your letter of the 31st 
ultimo, that you have continued to be afflicted with the complaint in your knee, but as you proposed going to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> 
(where I address you), I hope you hjave by this time recovered 
from it. 
</p><p>
Our late information from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> is highly encouraging. 
The partisans of Clinton and Y. B. are beginning already to 
display their suspicion and jealousy of each other; and my correspondents assure me that there is very little prospect of a union 
between them to nominate a P. and Y, P. In the mean time, it is 
stated that a powerful reaction has taken place throughout tne 
State. 
</p><p>
I shall be glad to have the earliest information of the decision of Messrs. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Madison</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="">Monroe</a>, as to their names continuing on the electoral ticket. 
</p><p>
Should you be able to execute your intention of visiting this 
city, I pray you to come at once to my house, where we have 
plenty of room for such accommodations as we shall take pleasure in affording you. It would add to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a>'s gratification

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your letter of the 4th instant, and 
I will take pleasure in having forwarded the letter which it inclosed, to Mr. Poinsett, with the first public dispatches. I should 
not hesitate to intimate to him my wish that he would comply 
with your request for the Mexican seeds, etc., if I were not persuaded that it would be altogether unnecessary for me to second 
any expression of your desire to him. Our country needs much 
the multiplication of the products of the earth, as well as of industry otherwise applied, and he deserves well of it, who will 
introduce a new, or more successfully cultivate an old article of 
agriculture. 
</p><p>
I do, my dear sir, know you too well to suppose that you ever 
countenanced the charge of corruption against me. No man of 
sense and candor at least none that know me ever could, or 
did countenance it. Your frank admission that you would have 
voted as I did, between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, accords 
with the estimate I have always made of your intelligence, your 
independence, and your patriotism. Nor am I at all surprised, or 
dissatisfied with the expression of your opinion that I erred in 
accepting the place which I now hold. When two courses present themselves in human affairs, and one only is pursued, experience develops the errors of the selection which has been made. 
Those which would have attended the adoption of the opposite 
course, can only be matter of speculation. Thus it is in the 
case referred to. We see, or think we see, distinctly, the errors 
^f the alternative which I embraced. But are we sure that, if I 
had chosen the other, I should not have been liable to greater 
hazard, or more animadversion? The truth is (as I have often 
said), my condition was one full of embarrassments, whatever 
way I might act. My own judgment was rather opposed to my 
acceptance of the Department of State, but my friends, and let 
me add, two of your best friends (Mr. McLane, of Delaware, 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a>), urged me strongly not to decline it. It was 
represented by my friends that I would get no credit for the forbearance, but that, on the contrary, it would be said that that 
very forbearance was evidence of my having made a* bargain, 
though unwilling to execute it. The office, they thought, was 
an office of the nation, not of the actual Presidential incumbent, 
and I was bound to look to the good of the country, and not to 
regard any personal objections which I had to him. Can you, 
v/ho have contributed, said they, to the election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, 
decline the Department of State? Will you not be charged if 
you do, with having co-operated in the election of a man, of 
whom you think so ill, that you will not serve in one of the 
highest places in the public councils with him? Even if he 
should be wanting in any of the requisite qualifications for the 
Station to which he has been elevated, yon are the more bound 
for that very reason to accept, in order to endeavor to guard the 
country against any danger from his mal-administration. Your 
enemies have sought by previous denunciation to frighten you. 
They do not believe that you have acted otherwise than from 
motives of the purest patriotism ; but they wish to alarm you, 
and prevent you from entering the Department of State. 
</p><p>
These, and other similar arguments were pressed on me, and 
after a week's deliberation, I yielded to their force. It is quite 
possible that I may have erred, and you may be right in predicting, as a consequence of my decision, that, being identified with 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>' administration, if he falls, I also shall fall. Should 
such be my fate, I shall submit to it, I hope, with the fortitude 
of a philosopher, if not with the resignation of a Christian. I 
shall at least have no cause of self-reproach, for I will undertake 
to affirm (and I appeal with confidence to Him who knows 
best the human heart, for the truth of the affirmation) that, 
throughout my public life, in the many trying situations in which 
I have been placed, I have been guided exclusively by the consideration of the good of my country. You say that I ought to 
have foreseen that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>' administration could hardly fail 
to be unpopular. I certainly did not foresee that the tree would 
be judged of, otherwise than by its fruits. Bat the popularity 
of a particular course or proceeding (although I will not pretend 
that I have been altogether regardless of it), has not been the 
deciding motive with me of my public conduct. Is the measure 
right? Will it conduce to the general happiness, and the elevation of the national character? These have been always my 
first and most anxious inquiries. 
</p><p>
I had fears of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>' temper and disposition, but I must 
say that- they have not been realized, and I have found in 
him, since I have been associated with him in the Executive 
Government, as little to censure or condemn as I could have 
expected in any man. Truth compels me to say that I have 
heartily approved of the leading measures of his administration., 
not excepting those which relate to Georgia. I have not time-, 
if I had ability, and it were necessary, to vindicate them. But, 
my dear sir, I must invoke your frankness and justice to reconsider the only exceptionable measure which you have specified, 
that of his recommendation of light-houses to the skies. It is 
not the metaphor, I presume, but the thing (an observatory), which has provoked your censure. And can you justly censure 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> for a recommendation which almost every previous 
President had made? If there be no power in the general Government to authorize the erection of an observatory within the 
limits of a State, is there none to sanction its location in this 
District? The message, I believe, was silent as to the place 
where it should be built. But I will dwell no longer on public 
affairs. I should not have touched the topic but for your friendly 
allusion to it. I turn from it with pleasure to the recollection of 
our amicable relations. Whatever you may have thought, or may 
have been sought to be infused into your mind, my friendly 
feelings toward you have never ceased ; and, although our correspondence has been interrupted four or five years, I have always 
entertained a lively solicitude for your welfare, and availed myself of every opportunity to inquire particularly about your 
health and situation. I have heard with unaffected pleasure of 
the improvement of your health. That it may be perfectly reestablished, and that you may be long spared for the benefit of 
your family, and the good of your country, is the sincere wish 
of your faithful friend and obedient servant.

My dear Sir, Your favor of yesterday is received. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pbp" rel="colleague friend met">General Porter</a> had been ill and absent from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>. He had returned, 
however, and I have a late letter from him. All accounts concur that the political efl'ect of Mr. Clinton's death will be favorable to the Administration ; and intelligence generally from that 
State, especially from the western portion of it, is very cheering. 
</p><p>
I really do not know (and who does ?) what Mr. R. means 
by his allusion to my letter addressed to you. I do not think 
there is any necessity for you or myself saying any thing on that 
subject. As to a statement of a conversation which he represents 
himself to have held with me, he has been so contradictory in 
the House about it, that, although my first impression, when I 
heard of it, was to have authorized a counter-statement, my 
friends think it is not worthy of such a notice. If I take any 
of it, I shall do it in some other way, and at a future day. 
</p><p>
I have a curious but friendly letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, in 
</p><p>
■which he says he never countenanced the calumny against me ; 
that he would have voted, as I did, between Jackson and Adams, 
etc. I have answered it in the most friendly terms, combatting, 
howex^er, some of his opinions. 
</p><p>
The inquiry in the Senate of Kentucky has terminated with 
the adoption of resolutions friendly to the Administration and 
myself. My friends there claim a decided and triumphant 
victory.

Mt dear Sib, Your favor of the 25th instant is received. 
The House of Representatives of Kentucky having been limited 
to an adjournment on a fixed day, when the resolution came to 
it from the Senate, there was not time to act on them, and it 
adjourned without taking them up. My friends there think we 
have gained a great victory. It will possibly lead to some further 
publications that may render it more decisive. The general 
ticket has passed, so that the entire vote of Kentucky may, I 
think, be now anticipated. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> letter to me has been seen by several of my 
friends, and has been spoken of, I understand, generally in this 
city. I should regret that the subject should get into the newspapers, but with that exception I do not know that I ought to 
object to its being mentioned. It is not confidential ; and, in 
my opinion, does <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> as much credit as it does me.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I was prepared to anticipate the declension, 
communicated in your letter of the 28th ultimo, of Messrs. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Madison</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="">Monroe</a>, to stand on your electoral ticket I regret that 
there should be any thing ambiguous in the terms which they 
have employed to express their refusal, though in that, also, I 
am not much disappointed. It will, for the moment, produce a 
bad ejffect, but I am persuaded that it will soon pass off. Our 
prospects are better, at this time, than they have been for many months. 
</p><p>
You will have seen the allusion made in Kentucky to a correspondence between Mr. Blair and myself,* and the defiance 
that has been thrown out as to my allowing the publication of it. 
I have a copy of the letter, on which reliance is placed. It is 
written in a style of playfidness,' and friendly familiarity, which 
constitutes the only objection I could possibly have to its publication. I shall let them go on making confident assertions in 
regard to its contents, and perhaps I may hereafter cause it to 
be published. With honorable men, it will do me good rather 
than harm. By the by, this is not a bad time to have the letter 
published which you did me the favor to submit to my inspection, last fall. 
</p><p>
At present, we have no messenger to send abroad. We rarely 
employ one to go to France or England, on account of the great 
regularity of the packets. I will bear in mind your wish concerning your nephew, should an occasion arise to dispatch a 
messenger.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I have received your favor of the 8th instant. 
If you do not, I do, feel the attacks on you, because I fear that 
they are the effect of our long-standing friendship. Their effect is less, it is true, considering the quarter from which they proceed. Pleasants, of " The Whig," has not the merit of first 
evincing a thorough knowledge of that being, Mr. . <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> long ago understood him, when he made an allusion to 
the same physical defect. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves, in 
reflecting that such a thing should be capable of inflicting any pain. 
</p><p>
I wish my letter to you of February 4,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>, could be drawn 
out ; but how is that to be done? I have a copy of mine to 
Blair, mentioned by you, and although there is a playfulness, 
not to say levity, about it, which renders it, perhaps, unfit for 
the public eye, I do believe that good, rather than evil, would 
attend its publication. The difliculty, and the only difficulty, 
with me, is, whether I ought to lend my sanction to such a violation of private intercourse, and whether, after yielding to it, 
there would not be other and further efl'orts and insinuations to 
deceive public credulity? If I authorize its publication, I do 
not think the time has yet arrived when that ought to be done. 
I will, if I do not forget it, send you hereafter a copy of the letter. 
</p><p>
Since the publication of my address, I have received a large 
mass of additional evidence, to the same tenor. Some of it is 
as strong as, if not stronger than, any which is now before the 
public. Ought I to publish it? I am afraid, on the one hand, 
of teasing the public, and on the other, of omitting any thing 
that is due to the occasion. 
</p><p>
You are assailed for the first time seriously. May I take the 
liberty of suggesting that you should not allow this wanton attack to afl^ect you, in the smallest degree? Above all, you should 
not permit yourself to use one expression, or to perform any act 
hastily. An unsullied character of more than threescore years 
duration, can surely successfully withstand the imbecile assaults 
of a miserable creature. 
</p><p>
I will send you a copy of the report of the committee respecting the six militia men. 
</p><p>
I am sorry for Leigh, quite as much on his as on public account. The gratification of private antipathy will never be allowed, before God or man, as a sufficient motive for the neglect 
</p><p>
of patriotic duty. Unless he fears R more even than he 
</p><p>
hates MR., the world and his own conscience will both 
</p><p>
condemn him. 
</p><p>
Our accounts are truly encouraging. From New York the 
current of favorable intelligence is steady, unchecked, and such 
as to justify a confident anticipation of our success. The Kentucky prospects, too, are good ; and if, as I believe, we shall succeed there, we shall owe our good fortune, in no small degree, 
to our Virginia friends.

My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 20th mstant. I 
had previously seen in the Whig my letter to you of the 4th of 
February,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>. It is believed here that its publication will do 
good. 
</p><p>
I am glad that you do not allow yourself to be affected by the 
calumnies of Mr. . Here, I assure you, they do you no prejudice, and create no other than a feeling of detestation tov/ard 
the author. " The Whig" has found out his sensitive part, and if 
man ever forfeited all claim to commisseration, on account of a 
physical misfortune, and justified the allusion to it by the wanton and unprovoked attacks which he makes upon others, Mr. 
is that man. 
</p><p>
I hope you will not fail to visit us in April. I think you 
would pass a week or two here very agreeably, and you are so 
near home that half a day will at any time take you there. 
Southard and Taliaferro are my next door neighbors, so that at 
my house you would be in the midst of y#ur friends.

The general aspect of our political news continues good, especially from Kentucky and New York.

of the appointment of our friend T . New York has not, in 
</p><p>
the person of any citizen of that State, a single representative at

the esteem of the people in that State. Under these views, the 
President thought he ought to be appointed, and his appointment 
has given very great satisfaction.

My dear Sir, I received your favor of 2d instant. My 
health remains pretty much in statu quo. I do not anticipate 
any considerable improvement of it until I commence my journey, 
which I propose doing about the 15th instant. I shall go through 
Virginia, but by what route I have not yet positively decided. 
I think I shall go to the mountains by the shortest. 
</p><p>
I have prepared a letter to the Central Administration Committee of Kentucky, in answer to one received from it on the 
subject of Amos Kendall, and his correspondence with me. I 
think some letters from him which I have authorized to be published, will fully establish his infamy. 
</p><p>
I am not preparing, nor shall I prepare, any answer to the address of the Jackson Central Committee of this place. My opinion is, that it is unworthy of notice from me. But I shall probably, publish, by way of supplement to my former address, a mass 
of testimony which has since accumulated on my hands, and I 
may publish it without comment. I have also addressed a letter 
to Kentucky to a friend (which he is authorized to publish), respecting my private affairs, which will relieve my friends from 
any anxiety on that account. 
</p><p>
Judge Savage declined the office of Treasurer, and it has been 
given to General Clarke, late Treasurer of Pennsylvania, who 
was turned out by the Jackson party last winter, because he is a 
friend to the Administration. There is some reason to hope that 
circumstances will hereafter admit of something being done for 
your friend. 
</p><p>
I regret that I have no copies of Mr. Burgess' two speeches, 
which I have never seen.

recommending Mr. Gibson, editor of " The Argus," as Surveyor

person should be appointed one who is not tainted with Jacksonism, and who may be agreeable to friends. Will you confer 
with Mr. Bouligny on the matter? 
</p><p>
We are now about one hundred and twenty miles from the

is excessive. I shall stop a few days at the White Sulphur

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, October 15,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1828">1828</a>. 
</p><p>
My DEAR Doctor, I observe that some of the Jackson party 
in Kentucky, for the purpose of withdrawing public attention 
from the alleged connection between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a>, have gotten up a charge against me of participation 
in the schemes of the latter. I have not myself thought it necessary to notice this new and groundless accusation ; but, prompted 
by the opinions of some of my friends, and actuated also by the 
desire to vindicate the memory of an inestimable but departed 
friend, who fell in the military service of his country, I communicate the following statement, which you are at liberty to 
publish. 
</p><p>
Public prosecutions were commenced in the Federal Court of 
Kentucky, against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a>, in the fall of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1806">1806</a>. He applied 
to me, and I engaged as his counsel, in conjunction with the 
late Colonel John Allen, to defend him. The prosecutions were 
conducted by the late Colonel Joseph Hamilton Daviess, a man 
of genius, but of strong prejudices, who was such an admirer of 
Colonel Hamilton that, after he had attained full age, he (Colonel D.) adopted a part of his name as his own. Both Colonel Allen 
and myself believed that there was no ground for the prosecutions, and that Colonel Daviess was chiefly moved to institute 
them by his admiration of Colonel Hamilton, and his hatred of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a>. Such was our conviction of the innocence of the 
accused, that, when he sent us a considerable fee, we resolved 
to decline accepting it, and accordingly returned it. We said to 
each other, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> has been an eminent member of the 
profession, has been Attorney-General of the State of New York, 
is prosecuted without cause in a distant State, and we ought not 
to regard him in the light of an ordinary culprit. The first 
prosecution entirely failed. A second was shortly afterward instituted. Between the two I was appointed a Senator of the 
United States. In consequence of that relation to the General 
Government, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a>, who still wished me to appear for 
him, addressed the note to me, of which a copy is herewith 
transmitted. I accordingly again appeared for him, with Colonel 
Allen ; and when the grand jury returned the bill of indictment 
not true, a scene was presented in the Court-room which I had 
never before witnessed in Kentucky. There were shouts of 
applause from an audience, not one of whom, I am persuaded, 
would have hesitated to level a rifle against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a>, if he believed that he aimed to dismember the Union, or sought to 
violate its peace, or overturn its Constitution. 
</p><p>
It is not true that the professional services of either Colonel 
Allen or myself were volunteered, although they were gratuitous. 
Neither of us were acquainted with any illegal designs whatever 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a>. Both of us were fully convinced of his innocence. A better or braver man, or a more ardent and sincere 
patriot than Colonel John Allen never lived. The disastrous 
field of Raisin, on which he fell, attests his devotion to his country. 
</p><p>
The affidavit of a Mr. John Downing has been procured and 
published, to prove that I advised him to enlist with Colonel Burr, and that I told him I was going with him myself. There 
is not one word of truth in it, so far as it relates to me. The 
ridiculous tale will be credited by no one who knows both of 
us. The certificate of some highly respectable men has been 
procured as to his character. His affidavit bears date on the 
third, and the certificate, on a detached paper, on the fourth instant. ] have no doubt that it was obtained on false pretences, and with an entire concealment of its object. I was at the 
period of the last prosecution preparing to attend the Senate of 
the United States at the seat of Government, many hundred miles 
in an opposite direction from that in which it afterward appeared 
Colonel Burr was bound. So far from my having sent any message to Mr. Downing, when I was last in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, I did not 
then ever dream that the malignity of party spirit could fabricate 
such a charge as has been since put forth against me. 
</p><p>
It is not true that I was at the ball given to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> in 
Frankfort. I was at the time in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. It is not true that 
he ever partook of the hospitality of my house. It was at that 
time a matter of regret with me that my professional engagements, and those connected with my departure for  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, 
did not allow me to extend to him the hospitality with which it 
was always my wont to treat strangers. He never was in my 
house, according to my recollection, but once, and that was the 
night before I started to this city, when, being myself a stranger 
in this place, he delivered me some letters of introduction, which I never presented. 
</p><p>
On my arrival here, in December,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1806">1806</a>, I became satisfied, 
from the letter in cypher of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> to General Wilkinson, 
and from other information communicated to me by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> had entertained illegal designs. At the 
request of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>, I delivered to him the original note 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> to me, of which a copy is now forwarded, and 
I presume it is yet among <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="">Mr. Jefferson's</a> papers. I was furnished 
with a copy of it, in the handwriting of Colonel Coles, his private secretary, which is with my papers in Kentucky. 
</p><p>
This, my dear doctor, is a true and faithful account of my connection with Colonel Burr.

My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 7th as I did the 
previous one, inclosing a letter from Mr. Spotswood. I need 
not say that it would have afforded me much satisfaction if I 
could have gratified this gentleman with the appointment to the 
vacant clerkship in the Department of State. But Mr. Trist 
came recommended to me by so many powerful considerations, 
of ample qualifications, a knowledge of foreign languages, etc., 
the necessity of his appointment to the personal comfort of Mr. 
R., that I could not decline appointing him. In his behalf, I 
declined appointing a brother-in-law of the President, who was 
urged on me. 
</p><p>
I can give you no satisfactory news about the election. The 
most discouraging aspect of our cause is that it is necessary that 
we should succeed in five or six disputed States to insure Mr. 
Adam's election. It will be wonderful if we do not fail in some 
one of them. The same mail that carries this letter will take 
you some information from New York, which will enable you 
to make an approximation. My solicitude about Kentucky is 
extreme. 
</p><p>
Have you read my Russell correspondence? I am deceived 
if the publication of it does not essentially benefit me. I wish, 
after the smart of the election is dissipated, that Pleasants 
would republish it.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, November 13, 182S. 
My dear Sir, I received your letter of the 6th instant. 
From the information which it communicates, and that which I 
derive from other channels, there is reason to apprehend that the 
vote of Kentucky has been given to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. Without 
that event, there is but too much probability of his election. 
To this decision of the people of the United States, patriotism 
and religion both unite in enjoining submission and resignation. 
For one, I shall endeavor to perform that duty. As a private 
citizen, and as a lover of liberty, I shall ever deeply deplore it. 
And the course of my own State, should it be what I have rea 
</p><p>
son to apprehend it has been, will mortify and distress me. I 
hope, nevertheless, that I shall find myself able to sustain with 
composure the shock of this event, and every other trial to which 
I shall be destined. 
</p><p>
You kindly promise me the suggestion of your ideas as to my 
future course. I shall await it with anxiety, and shall receive 
and deliberate upon it in the friendly spirit by which I know it 
will be dictated.

</p><p>
My dear Sib, I received your favor of the 11th instant, from 
which I am very sorry to learn that a late political event has 
produced on you so serious an effect. It is certainly not very 
agreeable, and, though feared, was not expected by me. It is 
undoubtedly calculated to weaken our confidence in the stability of our free institutions. But we ought not to allow this, 
or any other of the ills of human life, to deprive us of hope 
and fortitude. For myself, I declare to you most sincerely, that 
I have enjoyed a degree of composure, and of health too, since 
the event was known, greater than any I experienced for many 
months before. I shall continue at my post, honestly and faithfully discharging my duty, until the 4th of March, when I shall 
surrender my trust to other hands, which I hope may serve the 
public with more success with more patriotic zeal they can not. 
In my retirement to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, I shall find tranquillity, and whatever my future situation may be, I shall continue to employ my 
best exertions for the preservation and perpetuation of those 
great principles of freedom and policy, to the establishment of 
which my public life has hitherto been sincerely dedicated. I 
believe the other members of the Administration, including its 
head, will, in their respective spheres, calmly exercise equal diligence, till the arrival of the same period. 
</p><p>
A most wild and reprehensible suggestion has been made by 
some anonymous correspondent of the Editors of "The Intelligencer," whose letter is published in their paper of this day, to 
defeat the election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, by the Electoral Colleges, or some of them, taking up a new candidate. Nothing 
could be more exceptionable than such an attempt at this time. 
</p><p>
It would be a gross violation of the pledge which has been implied, if not expressed, in the choice of all the electors. Calamitous as I regard the election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, I should consider the defeat of his election, at this time, by any such means, 
as a still greater calamity.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 22d. The inauspicious issue of the election has shocked me less than I feared 
it would. My health and my spirits, too, have been better, 
since the event was known, than they were many weeks before. 
And yet all my opinions are unchanged and unchangeable, about 
the dangers of the precedent which we have established. The 
military principle has triumphed, and triumphed in the person of 
one devoid of all the graces, elegances, and magnanimity, of the 
accomplished men of the profession. 
</p><p>
Our course is a plain one. We must peaceably submit to 
what we have been unable to avert, firmly resolved to adhere to 
our principles, and to watch over the Republic like faithful sentinels. We should especially avoid gratuitous propositions of 
support to the new Administration, or, on the other hand, a rash 
and precipitate opposition. Many of our friends have got under the hostile standard. We should endeavor to recall them to 
their duty by kindness. A blind and precipitate attack would 
produce union where now there is nothing but the elements of 
discord. 
</p><p>
I thank you and Mrs. Niles for the high compliment you 
</p><p>
have lately paid me. It is a better evidence of the fidelity of 
your friendship than of your discretion, at this time. With my 
best wishes for the mother and son, I remain your friend.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, Having nothing to offer you from this place, I 
am anxious to learn from you what is passing at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. 
Here we are in a political eddy, the currents from which will not 
break out and show themselves until about the Ides of March. 
There is nothing but vague speculation in regard to the intentions of the President-elect, with which it is not worth while to 
trouble you. Toward the bottom, indeed, there is some movement in the water already, but it does not show itself upon the 
surface. It is said that a good deal of jealousy is felt, and in 
private circles sometimes manifests itself, among the partisans of 
the Vice-President and the Governor-elect of New York. 
</p><p>
I get a great many letters from all quarters, conveying strong 
sentiments of unabated confidence and ardent attachment. I am 
frequently, too, favored with the advice of friends of a directly 
opposite tenor. One tells me, for example, that I should retire 
from public life for two or three years ; while another is equally 
positive that I should forthwith return to the House of Representatives. I have as yet decided upon no course for myself, 
and shall decide upon none until my return to Kentucky. In 
the meantime, I should be glad to be favored with your opinion, 
and that of other friends whom you may think proper to consult. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison's</a> letters are sought after with great avidity. They 
have produced much effect, and I think are likely to produce 
much more. This is evidenced by the violence of some of those 
who are opposed to the Tariff. You will he shocked when I 
tell you that one of them, and one, too, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison's</a> own 
State, I have been told, said that he ought to have died, or that 
he wished he had died, five years ago. 
</p><p>
But to return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. What will be done with the Convention question? What is the tone of party spirit? Is it a 
proscription there, as in some other places?

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 10,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1829">1829</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I perceive from your letter of the 5th instant, 
at St. Juhen, that you had not then received one which I addressed to you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, where I presume it is now awaiting your return. 
</p><p>
We are here absokitely without any thing new or interesting. 
Congress is in no disposition to do business. The present Administration is winding up their public affairs, originating no new 
measures, and endeavoring to turn their stewardship over to their 
successors in the best state possible. In respect to the purposes 
of the new Administration, or rather the intentions of the President-elect, nothing seems to be known here. We have vague 
speculations only in place of positive information.  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, therefore, is not at present the source of news. We must 
look to other quarters for it. And accordingly we have been 
turning our attention toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. There appears in 
your Legislature to be so many projects in regard to the basis of 
the representation in your Convention, that Vv'^e are at a loss to 
conjecture whether any thing or what will be done. 
</p><p>
As far as I can learn (and on that subject a good deal of information reaches me), there is a good spirit prevailing among 
our friends every where. They seem to be generally impressed 
with the belief that our true policy, at present, is to do nothing 
but look on ; that they ought to avoid alike hostility or professions of support toAvard the new Administration ; that until it 
begins to act, there are no means of judging what its course will 
be ; that in the mean time, holding fast to all our principles, and 
keeping constantly in view the danger to civil liberty of the predominance of the military spirit, we should preserve stout hearts, and be prepared to act, under contingences, according to the 
impulses of a generous patriotism. 
</p><p>
Whether I ought to be brought out, and when, must be left 
exclusively to my friends. This latter point, supposing the first 
affirmatively settled, is one of great delicacy. Precipitancy and 
tardiness should be equally avoided. The public wants tranquillity after the late agitation. To present formally candidates 
for the succession, before the President-elect enters on the duties 
of his office, would be premature and offeiftive to the quiet, 
that is, the larger portion of the community. It would be otherwise if the candidates of the Jackson party were announced. 
</p><p>
Where Jacksonism has prevailed, and secured majorities in the 
Legislatures of the different States, those majorities are more inimical to me, at this time, than majorities in those Legislatures 
ever will be hereafter. They have been elected under an excitement, and I have remarked always that the representatives of 
the people, when so elected, are ahead of the people themselves 
in reference to that particular excitement. 
</p><p>
It will be time enough, upon my return to Kentucky after the 
4th of March, to decide whether I shall remain in private, or 
again seek to enter public life. I should be glad to know your 
views, and those of other friends, on that point. I presume there 
will be no difficulty in my return to the House of Representatives, if I should permit myself to be a candidate. 
</p><p>
The health of Mr. Southard has been bad throughout the 
session. He is now confined to his house, but I hear is better 
to-day. Without, perhaps, there being any cause of immediate 
apprehension, I think his situation is one full of anxiety to his 
friends and connections. 
</p><p>
Do you not mean to visit us? I need not say that I should 
see you with great pleasure, and although this city presents less 
attractions than usual at this season to the ladies, we should be 
most happy to see Mrs. Brooke also with you at my house.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, Ten days confinement from a severe indisposition produced by cold, has delayed my answer to your favor 
of the 14th inst. I am now better, though I still feel much debility from the attack. 
</p><p>
I should be extremely gratified to be able to accept for myself 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a> your kind invitation to visit you and Mrs. Brooke, 
at St. Julien, but I regret that it will not be in our power to 
avail ourselves of it. At the season of the year when we shall 
return to Kentucky, that is, about the 10th of March, we have 
no alternative but to proceed to Wheeling or Pittsburg. The 
roads on every other route will be then almost impassable. 
From the present time, until the period of our departure, we 
shall be constantly occupied with winding up my official business ; with packing up, sending off, and disposing of fmiiiture; 
and with other arrangements for the journey. 
</p><p>
I should be very much pleased to visit <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. It would 
afford me much satisfaction to see my friends, and I doubt not 
that there are many of them that would be happy to meet 
me. But I must own to you frankly, that I should not expect to 
derive any political benefit from such a visit. The contest has 
been too recent, passions have not yet sufficiently abated, prejudices are yet too high and strong, to make me an acceptable 
guest at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, where a large majority of the Legislature is 
of an opposite faith from that which I profess. I should, undoubtedly, find among that majority much of the courtesy which 
characterizes our native State. I should even, now and then find a friend, but the great mass would be animated by a spirit, 
positively, if not bitterly hostile. You must have remarked 
what I have often observed, that when a particular popular current prevails, the representatives of the people elected under its 
impulse, are in advance of the people themselves in violence. 
It is on this principle that I am inclined to think that the Jackson majorities in the Legislatures, this winter, are more adverse 
to me than they will probably be at any future time. 
</p><p>
With respect to any movements in regard to the successor of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, I believe I have already said to you that I think 
it would be premature now to commence them. The next six 
months the next six weeks may develop important events, 
and shed brilliant light upon our path. At all events, I do not 
wish that our friends should disturb the public in the enjoyment 
of that tranquillity, of which, after the late violent agitation, it 
has so much need. As to the danger which some apprehend, 
of the separation and dispersion of our friends, I do not participate in their fears. The same principles which have guided 
them heretofore, will continue to unite them together. In every 
demonstration which has been made during the present winter 
(witness the Senatorial elections in Ohio, Delaware, Maine, etc.), 
they stand firm and unshaken. 
</p><p>
Should any thing occur to me prior to my departure for Kentucky, as being expedient to be done, in relation to the Presidential succession, I will communicate it to you.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received the last letter which you did me 
the favor to write me, and I have since received the publication 
relating to the TarilT, to which it refers. From the course which 
that business is taking in your Legislature, I apprehend that a 
majority will oppose itself to the opinions of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison</a>. 
</p><p>
After a great deal of speculation in relation to the new Cabinet, an arrangement of it is now spoken of with great confidence. If that be executed it will consist of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> for the State Department, Ingham for the Treasury, Eaton for the 
War, Branch for the Navy, Berrian for Attorney-General, M'Lean 
to continue Post-master General, or to be put upon the bench 
of the Supreme Court ; and, in the latter case, Colonel Johnson, 
of Kentucky, to be appointed Post-master General. Yan Buren 
has, from the first, run upon all the tickets for the State Department, and I conclude, therefore, that he will be appointed. I 
was at first incredulous as to the other persons spoken of as Secretaries ; but I have been compelled at last to believe that they 
are, at least at this time, designed for these respective places. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to hear from you after the decision of the 
Tariff resolutions in your House of Delegates. Let me know 
if there is any diminution in the number of those who have 
heretofore opposed the power. From your silence in your last 
letter, I infer, as I had anticipated, that the tone of the Jackson 
portion of your Legislature, with two or three exceptions, is decidedly hostile to me.

</p><p>
Mr DEAR Sir, I have not written you very lately, because, 
having nothing to communicate which the papers did not contain, I did not wish to make you pay postage for the thousand 
rumors with which this city has been filled. Among the official 
corps here there is the greatest solicitude and apprehension. The 
members of it feel something like the inhabitants of Cairo when 
the plague breaks out ; no one knows who is next to encounter 
the stroke of death ; or which, with many of them is the same 
thing, to be dismissed from office. You have no conception of 
the moral tyranny which prevails here over those in employment. It is, however, believed that the work of expulsion will 
not begin till after the adjournment of the Senate. 
</p><p>
It is said that Amos Kendall, of Kentucky, is to be appointed 
an auditor, and Tom Moore minister to Colombia ! 
</p><p>
I take my departure to-morrow. My inclination at present is 
not to return to the next Congress, but I shall reserve a final 
decision of the question, for a consideration of all circumstances, 
after my return home. The major part of my friends, whom I 
have consulted, think a seat in the next Congress inexpedient. 
Among them all the best spirit prevails, and high and confident 
hopes are cherished by them. Every movement of the President, 
though dictated by personal resentment toward me, conduces to 
my benefit, especially his Kentucky appointments. 
</p><p>
Let me hear often from you, and believe me ever your devoted 
friend.

Mt dear Friend, W. C. C. Claiborne having decided rather 
suddenly to throw himself on board a steamboat about departing 
for Louisville, I have only time to say that we reached this place 
the day before yesterday, nine clays after you, in good health. 
I found here your letter, informing me of your journey, 
etc. The same snow that you left on the mountains remained, 
and smoothed our passage over them, although it rendered us 
somewhat uncomfortably cold. 
</p><p>
My journey has been marked by every token of warm attachment and cordial demonstrations. I never experienced more 
testimonies of respect and confidence, nor more enthusiasm. 
Dinners, suppers, balls, etc. I have had literally a free passage. 
Taverns, stages, toll-gates have been generally thrown open to 
me, free from all charge. Monarchs might be proud of the reception with which I have been every where honored. 
</p><p>
The work of proscription has commenced at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> and elsewhere. Our poor friends, Cutts, Watkins, and Lee, are 
among the sufferers. Editor Hill has succeeded the first, Editor Kendall the second, and Major Lewis the last. So we go. 
</p><p>
Let me hear from you, and often, I entreat of you, for no one feels more warmly actuated in the welfare of you both than your constant friend.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, Your favor of the 29th ultimo is duly received. I must refer you to the public prints for the incidents 
of a journey which, though performed at an unpleasant season, 
and over bad roads, was full of gratification, on account of the 
testimonials of esteem, public and private, by which it was attended. On Saturday next I am to attend a public dinner, 
which promises to be the largest ever given in this State. 
</p><p>
I have been much occupied, since my return, with repairs to 
my house, grounds, and farm. As far as I have yet been able 
to learn the state of public feeling and sentiment toward me, it 
is far from being unfavorable, except with a few of the most 
violent of the Jackson party. Many of them have come out 
openly for me, and several of the most prominent of them in this 
district have communicated their wishes that I would offer for 
Congress. I could not only be elected with the most perfect 
ease, but I have reason to believe that there would be no opposition from any quarter whatever. The public, nevertheless, 
confiding, perhaps, too much in my judgment as to what is best 
to be done, is entirely disposed to acquiesce in any resolution I may take. That which I have adopted, is, to offer for no office 
at present, and until I can see more distinctly than I do now 
how I can be useful, but to remain in private life, attending to 
the care of my private affairs, and the re-establishment of my 
health. I was consulted repeatedly to know if I vv^ould serve in 
the Legislature, but I thought it best to decline. 
</p><p>
There is enough in passing events, God knows, to alarm, to 
arouse, and to urge to the most strenuous exertions ; but, if I 
were to put myself forward, my motives and my actions would 
be questioned, and perhaps the reaction so desirable would be 
retarded, instead of being accelerated. Others, I think, had 
better take the lead, who stand in attitudes less likely to excite 
passion and prejudice. Above all, we must rely upon the reflections and convictions among the Jackson party themselves. 
Already they begin to repent, that is, many of the better portion 
of them. Pride restrains them from denouncing openly, with 
their mouths, an Administration which they detest from their 
hearts. As time elapses, and new events are developed, they 
will take courage, and finally concur in restoring the civil rule. 
</p><p>
I have not determined to return to the practice of my old profession, and nothing but necessity will compel me to put on the 
harness again. That I hope to be able to avoid. 
</p><p>
I must request that you will keep me informed of ail that relates to your Convention, its composition, etc., etc.

My dear Sir, I have lately purchased in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> County, Pennsylvania, fifty full-blooded Merino ewes, the choice out 
of three hundred, part of one of the finest flocks in the country, 
which belonged to the late IVIr. K. W. Meade, whose persecution 
and sufferings were so well known in Spain. The choice was 
made by a friend of mine, himself one of the largest sheep owners in Pennsylvania, and one of the best judges that I know of. 
There are about sixteen or eighteen lambs with them, and I suppose an equal portion of rams. I expect them all ar Maysville 
in the course of eight or ten days, on their way to my residence. 
</p><p>
It is my intention to let a few of my particular friends have 
about a dozen of them, at reasonable prices. If you wish any 
of them you may have your choice of an ewe with the ram 
lamb belonging to her, at ^25 for both. Should you decide to 
take them, you may show this letter to Messrs. January & Co., 
as their authority for delivering them to you. 
</p><p>
Is there not danger, my dear sir, of an adverse result to the 
Congressional election in your district? I fear it, and I hear perhaps some things that you do not. There is much dissatisfaction among our friends in Bom'bon, as I regret to learn. They 
think that they are entitled to the member. Can you not devise some plan to collect and concentrate public opinion in behalf of one candidate of the party of our friends? There is no 
one in the district that I should be more happy to see elected 
than yourself ; and I hope, if you continue to offer, that you may 
be. But if it be impracticable, from any cause, perseverance 
might display resolution without leading to any good issue. 
Perseverance indeed, without success, might lead to the worst 
consequences to yourself and to the district. It might give a 
permanently unfriendly character to the district. Such I have 
several times observed to be the effect of divisions elsewhere 
among our friends. 
</p><p>
There is always danger, which I trust I need not guard you 
against, of the opposite party practicing deception in regard to 
the prospects of candidates among their opponents. 
</p><p>
I pray you, my dear sir, to appreciate the friendly motives 
which have dictated these observations, to which you will give 
just so much weight as they deserve. 
</p><p>
Under all circumstances and every contingency I pray you to 
believe me sincerely your friend.

My dear Sir, I have been mortified by the late movements 
in Bourbon, in bringing out Mr. Marshall for the House of Representatives, lest you might suppose that when I wrote to you a 
few days ago, I had some knowledge that they were in contemplation. Such a supposition would be very far from the fact. 
I had no more knowledge or information about them, when I 
wrote that letter, than the man in the moon. I had indeed understood from Mr. Marshall himself, that he would not be a candidate, and I was well pleased with that decision, because I believed it to be in conformity with the best interests of his family. 
And now I have no doubt, indeed I have heard that he had been 
brought out, most reluctantly on his part, in consequence of the 
state of things to which I alluded in my last, as existing in 
Bourbon. 
</p><p>
I derived information of that state of things, principally from 
Mr. Rain, the sheriff of Bourbon, and Mr. Spiers, who were at 
my house the day after the dinner at Fowler's garden. They 
both represented the dissatisfaction in Bourbon, among our 
friends, to be very great, because a candidate was not selected 
from that county, and they both concurred in expressing the 
belief that they could not be prevailed upon to rally at the polls 
on any candidate out of Bourbon, Mr. Rain expressing that opinion with more, and Mr. Spiers with less, confidence. I urged 
them to support you. Tliey said that they hoped some measure 
would be yet adopted to collect the sense, and unite the exertions 
of our friends throughout the district. I of course supposed that 
that measure would be some such as was adopted last year. I 
went to Madison on Tuesday last, and it was not until my return 
on Thursday, that I learned what had transpired in Bourbon. 
</p><p>
I have thought these statements due to our long and warm 
friendship, and I hope they will be received in the spirit in which 
they are made. 
</p><p>
I have not yet heard of my sheep having been started.

My dear Sir, I quit this city with much regret, on account 
of my not seeing you. The trial of young Wickliffe, fixed for 
Tuesday next, and the preparations incident to it, oblige me to 
go. I have, during four days, been in constant expectation of 
your arrival. I am informed by rumor only, of your being on 
board the Hibernia. 
</p><p>
I have not time to enter into details on public affairs. Unless 
my friends are greatly deceived, there is not a particle of doubt 
about the disposition of Kentucky, to support me, and although 
it is too early to draw the line between those who are for, and 
those who are against me, we have reason to hope the friendship 
of the majority of the next Legislature. 
</p><p>
I should be extremely delighted to see you at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>. Can

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received and have attentively read your 
favor of the 26th ultimo, with the inclosure, the address to the 
voters of the Second Congressional district. I entertain no doubt 
that you have correctly represented the purport of your interviews 
with Major Allen, and that you have been unjustly dealt by on 
account of them. 
</p><p>
I view with inexpressible regret the state of things in your district, and I should be most happy to learn that any mode had 
been adopted to concentrate on yourself, or any other friend, the 
votes of those who concur in their political principles. Can no 
such mode be fallen upon? Is it not yet practicable to convene 
persons together from all parts of the district? Of what avail to 
the present candidates, on the same side, can it be to persevere, 
with the certainty of defeat before them all? How will the 
honor of any one of them be vindicated by such a course? Defeat can neither gratify friends nor the candidate himself. It 
may display his resolution, but it can prove nothing else. Most 
certainly neither of the candidates can feel gratified by being the 
instrument (should such be the resuU) of the failure of his competitor on the same side. 
</p><p>
The existing state of things can afford pleasure to none but our 
opponents. They alone will profit by it. And I fear that it 
may lead, in yoiu: district, to pernicious consequences permanently. 
</p><p>
I have not seen nor heard directly from Mr. Marshall since he 
was announced. I believe him utterly incapable of deception ; 
and I therefore feel confident that he has been brought out contrary to his wishes ; for he told me in April that he had no desire 
whatever to be a candidate. I do not know him, if he would 
not concur in any honorable expedient by which a member can 
be returned favorable to those views of national policy which 
both he and you entertain. 
</p><p>
But I must leave this painful subject, fearing, I confess, that 
owing to the unhappy divisions among friends, we are destined 
to add another to the long catalogue of defeats, from the same 
cause, which we have sustained within a few years. 
</p><p>
I have been disappointed in not receiving the Merino sheep, 
which, I presume, have been kept to be sent when the weather 
is somewhat cooler. You shall be advised of their amval.

</p><p>
My bear Sir, I received your obliging letter of the "Sth instant, under date at Maysville, and I perused with great satisfaction the information and reflections it contains. Although I have 
an aversion to some long letters, it does not extend to that, and 
you would greatly oblige me by frequently writing me similar ones. I agree with you in most of the reflections -which you 
have communicated. The elements undoubtedly exist for a 
serious, if not doubtful struggle, at t!ie next presidential election. 
I believe with you, that, on certain contingences, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> will be again brought forward. But whether he should be 
or not, if the party that elected him can be kept together, in 
any considerable extent, it will be formidable, whoever else may 
happen to be taken up. The next session of Congress will, I 
think, greatly add to the dissolvents of that party which are now 
operating. Whatever the President may say or recommend in 
his message to Congress, his friends in the body must divide on 
certain leading measures of policy. Each section of it will claim 
him as belonging to it, if he should be silent, and a quarrel between them is inevitable. On the contrary, if he speak out his 
sentiments (probably the safest course for him, whatever they 
may be), he must throw from him all of his party v\^ho are opposed to his sentiments, and those thus cast off, must, sooner or 
later, attach themselves to the party which has all along been 
adverse to the General. If, for example, he comes out for the 
Tariff, the South leaves him, and will try another change, if it can 
effect it, of the office of chief magistrate. If he comes out in 
opposition to the Tariff, there will be such an opposition to him 
in the Tariff States, as must prevent his re-election. 
</p><p>
The worst course for those who were opposed to his election, 
and are now unwilling to see him re-elected, is that he should 
declare himself unequivocally for the Tariff. The best course for 
them is, that he should come out clearly against the Tariff. In 
the former case, it would be difficult to detach, in sufficient numbers, the friends of the system from him, and make them comprehend the expediency of supplanting the head of an Administration favorable to their views. This was done in the case of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, but that was an exception, from various causes. In 
the latter supposition it would not, I think, be at all difficult or 
impracticable to unite the friends of the Tariff, and place at the 
head of the Administration one who would promote their policy. 
In short, I think matters have come, or are rapidly tending, to 
such a state of things, that those who are in favor, or those who 
are against certain measures of policy, must govern. Masks must 
be cast off, and the real color and complexion of men and their 
opinions must be seen. 
</p><p>
In respect to my future personal movementSj I hope so to conduct myself as to satisfy my friends. I appeared for young 
Wickliffe with some reluctance. I would have avoided doing 
so, if I could have avoided it honorably. But the case had such 
a triumphant issue, that I have been greatly benefited by it, in 
this State, instead of being injuriously affected. 
</p><p>
I will write you after the result of the August elections is certainly known. Prospects continue very good, but they are better for the State Legislature than for Congress. In Chambers' 
late district you saw what they were. Mr. Marshall has declined, 
but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Beatty's</a> election is still regarded uncertain.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, The result of our Congressional elections was 
not as favorable as might have been, owing to bad arrangements. 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Beatty</a> was beaten by a majority of only twelve, owing to Bedinger's perseverance as a candidate, and his own want of tact. 
In Tom Moore's old district our triumph is complete. 
</p><p>
In both branches of our General Assembly we have large majorities, bordering upon two thirds in each, of friends of the late 
Administration. The majorities friendly to me are still larger. 
</p><p>
Ought our Legislature to do any thing, and what, at the ensuing session? Let me knov/ your opinion, and that of our 
friends in your quarter. 
</p><p>
It may adopt either of two courses : Make a direct nomination, 
or, avoiding that, limit itself to an expression of undiminished 
confidence and attachment, and a discrediting of calumnies, etc., 
etc. What is best? Or is it best to embrace neither course? 
</p><p>
My health continues good. Mrs. Erwin remains at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>,

My dear Sir, My friend Mr. Ewing informs me that he sent 
my sheep on the 26th ultimo, from his residence, near  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, in Pennsylvania, in the care of a man whose name he has 
omitted to mention. They were to proceed by land, and were 
expected to travel at the rate of about fifteen miles per day. If 
no accident has happened, they ought to be at Maysville about 
the time this letter reaches you. I will thank you to take measures to secure a knowledge of their arrival, so that you and Mr. Foreman may make choice of the ewe and ram lamb which I 
have reserved for each of you. Should you prefer not to take 
the dams of the particular lambs which you may choose, you 
are at liberty to take other ewes, without lambs, in lieu of them. 
As the weaning-time is at hand, I thought this option might be 
agreeable to you. This letter is an authority for the selection 
which you may make, as well as your friends. 
</p><p>
I received your favor in regard to the unfortunate issue of the 
election. You have no friend who more sincerely regrets it than 
I do ; but as that is now unavailing, I hope, with you, that it 
may lead to no lasting consequences of a nature to be deprecated.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received both your favors of the 11th July 
and 4th ultimo, to which I should have sooner replied; but for 
my absence from home, and that I did not suppose there was 
any urgency in my transmitting a reply. 
</p><p>
On public affairs, I have but little to say in addition to what 
you will find in the public prints. The result of our election to 
the Legislature of Kentucky, gave a decided majority, beyond 
all doubt, to our friends, in both of its branches. The people 
of the State would, to-morrow, give a different decision from 
what they did in November last, upon the same state of the question on which they then acted ; that is, a contest between the 
same parties. The manner in which the power of patronage 
has been exercised, has dissatisfied thousands who voted for 
Jackson. There is a large class of his supporters who now 
avow that their opposition was to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, and not to me. 
This same distinction is taken in other Western States. I have 
every reason to be satisfied with the state of things in Kentucky. 
Whether any measures, in relation to myself, will be adopted at 
the next session of our Legislature, and if any, what its character may be, will depend upon intervening events, and upon consultation among my friends after they assemble at the seat of 
Government. 
</p><p>
I hardly know what to say about your land near Madisonville. It would afford me much pleasure to render you any 
assistance in my power, but I am afraid to assume any direction about it, lest I should not be able to do what might be 
necessary. The land is remote from me, and it would be as 
difficult for me to attend to the tenanting or processioning of it 
as it would be for you to perform the same operation on a tract 
of land in Franklin or Pittsylvania. I have great confidence in 
Triplett, and I think when you hear from him, he will account 
satisfactorily for his silence. My personal acquaintance in that 
quarter is very limited. I shall set out, in a few days, on a trip 
to Russellville, and perhaps I may meet with some one, during 
the performance of it, who may give me useful information in 
regard to your land, and I will bear the subject in mind, so as 
to make inquiries when opportunities shall occur. But I must 
advise that you would rely more particularly on some one residing nearer the land than I do. If it fias no intruder upon it, 
you are in no danger. But if there be any person settled on it, 
claiming under an adverse title, it may be necessary for you to 
adopt measures, by bringing suit, or otherwise, to prevent the 
operation of the law of this State, commonly called the Seven 
Years' Limitation Law. According to that law, a peaceable and 
undisturbed possession, during seven years, under a title derived 
from the State, protects the occupant against any outstanding 
adverse claim. I need not tell you that the validity of the law 
is controverted ; but it is wise not to be obliged to depend upon 
that plea exclusively. Pray remember me affectionately to Mrs. 
Brooke, and believe me ever cordially your friend.

My dear Sir, I received with great thankfulness your several interesting communications from Northampton, which shall 
be returned as you desire. I have also received your last favor, 
without date, from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. I have perused with great attention these several letters. The contents of some of them 
are highly curious. 
</p><p>
I envy you your pleasure at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. How much should I 
have been delighted, if I could have shared them with yourself and Mrs. J. 
</p><p>
I have just returned from my dreaded tour to the southern 
part of this State. I went as far as Hopkinsville. Mr. and 
Mrs. Erwin, and four or five ladies from Mississippi, accompanied me to Russellville. From that point they proceeded to 
Nashville. The tour was full of gratification. Every sort of 
enthusiastic demonstration of friendship and attachment, on the 
part of the people, was made toward me. Barbecues, dinners, 
balls, etc., etc., without number. 
</p><p>
I have been really in danger of that gout with which I have 
been threatened by some of the Jackson party. And tell Mrs. J. 
that if I had a younger heart, that also would have been in danger 
amid the blaze of beauty in the State of Green River. I thought 
the men, and women too, would devour me. I devoured many 
of their good dishes at their numerous festivals. 
</p><p>
In spite of all my prudence, which nobody, I am sure, will 
question, I was forced to speak often and long. At Russellville, 
and Hopkinsville, I spoke upward of three hours together, to at 
least three thousand persons at each place. My addresses were 
never better received by all parties, nor were they ever more 
satisfactory to myself. 
</p><p>
Things could not be expected to be more favorable in Kentucky than they are at this time. I entertain not a particle of 
doubt of there being at this moment a decided majority for me 
against all and every person whatever. 
</p><p>
From what I hear, the Legislature will do something at the 
next session, to testify its regard for me. What that will be 
may depend .on subsequent events. But something will be done. 
Should things remain pretty much as they now are, it may not, 
and I think, ought not to be a nomination. We ought not to 
take upon ourselves the responsibility of a premature agitation 
of a certain question. Still, events at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> may possibly 
occur early in the winter, to render necessary, and to justify 
that measure. I think our friends may place all reliance on 
Kentucky, and on the discretion of the next general assembly. 
</p><p>
Present me affectionately to Mrs. J., whose leisure I hope will 
permit her often to write me during your abode at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>.

My dear Sir, Will you think of the suggestion contained 
in the inclosed letter, from a very worthy and intelligent friend, 
formerly in Congress, and send it to Niles, or some other complacent person to act upon, if you do not disapprove it? 
</p><p>
I have nothing to send you from this quarter. In Kentucky 
and I believe generally in the West, we have every reason for 
encouragement.

I shall go to the last (I must sincerely hope) of the public 
barbecues in this State next week. That is in Mercer, to which 
I am invited by a majority of Jackson men. You know Mercer is the center of our State and Tom Moore's headquarters. 
If my addresses should satisfy me as well as those did at Russellville and Hopkinsville, it will do good.

and I thank you for the views and information which it communicates. 
</p><p>
There is the best and most friendly disposition prevailing so 
far with our Legislature at Frankfort. They are disposed to do 
any thing right and politic ; but, from what I learn, I [resume 
nothing will be done but to present an argumentation-report in 
favor of the Tariff and Internal Improvements, in which will be 
embodied same friendly expressions concerning me. The Governor gets along without difficulty. Much good spirit exists in 
regard to the State's doing something for its own improvement ; 
but the great obstacle is the want of means, and the want of 
union as to objects to be first undertaken. 
</p><p>
I am busy in making preparation for my intended voyage to 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>. I purpose leaving home in less than a fortnight, 
about the 12th of next month. I regret to find that my expected 
visit there has already excited more expectation than I would 
have wished. I have heard nothing of General Van Rensselaer. 
I am afraid that the frightful state of our roads has deterred him 
from making his intended detour. I shall lament this the more, 
because I think we should have arranged it to descend the river 
together. 
</p><p>
P. S. Should you address me, as I hope you may, while I am 
at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, your letters put under cover to Nicholas Bertrand, Esq., Shipping-port, Kentucky, would quickly reach me.

My dear Sir, Your Alma Mater is a petitioner to Congress. 
The affliction which has recently occurred, presents her in that 
posture. Transylvania University was the first temple of science 
erected in the wilds of the West. Do not these circumstances 
give some claim to the charity of a generous Government? If 
you think so, will you say one friendly word in behalf of the 
application?

My dear Sir, Your several letters addressed to me in Kentucky, and at this place, have been received. Owing to the 
Ohio river being closed by ice, I did not receive the former as 
early as they would have reached me by land. That obstruction 
being now removed, and boats daily arriving from Louisville, I 
shall receive the letters of my friends with more regularity, 
during the ten or twelve days that I propose yet to continue in 
this city. Except the two short excursions to Mr. Goniot's and 
Mr. Millegan's, I have not been out of the city and its immediate neighborhood. I have been treated throughout with the 
greatest respect and attention. Some of the more prominent 
Jacksonians, especially those who are expecting offices, keep 
at a distance ; but all others, embracing many of that party, 
have been extremely civil. I have been invited to public 
dinners at Memphis, Vicksburg, Fort Gibson, Natchez, and 
Baton Rouge, but I have declined all, except that proposed at Natchez. 
</p><p>
I have been often with your friend. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pbp" rel="colleague friend met">Judge Porter</a>, who I think 
worthy of all the fine things you have said of him to me. I 
like him extremely, and hope that our acquaintance will leave 
impressed upon him toward me the same sentiments of esteem 
and friendship which I feel for him. 
</p><p>
I shall expect eagerly <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster's</a> second speech on Mr. Foote's resolution, of which your letters and those of other friends 
have communicated such flattering accounts. The triumph which 
he enjoyed was a noble one. I fear his resolution against Duff 
Green was premature, and dictated by a chafed and proud spirit, 
indignant at his vile misrepresentations. His ninth Thermidoi 
has not, I fear, yet arrived. 
</p><p>
I have been agreeably surprised to find the opinion in favor 
of the Taritf so general and so strong in this State. You must 
not be surprised to find yourself shortly instructed by the Legislature to support it. From what I learn, at least two thirds of the 
Legislature, if not more, are in favor of it ; but they have great 
difficulty in collecting and keeping the members at Donaldsville. 
</p><p>
Duralde has declined being a candidate for Governor, at a moment when, they tell me, his election would have been certain, 
if Roman had declined, and probably if he would not. He did not wish to produce divisions among friends, and really cared 
nothing about the office. 
</p><p>
My best respects to Mrs. Johnston.

My dear Sir, ^You will perceive, from the inclosed, that my 
anticipation has been realized. You will now be at liberty to 
pursue your own judgment in relation to the great measure referred to. On that subject two grounds will naturally suggest themselves to you, as forming a justification for your future course : 
1st, the will of your constituents ; and, secondly, that you will 
not assist in disturbing an established policy. 
</p><p>
I expect to reach Natchez to-morrow morning, and I shall remain there until Sunday the 14th, when I shall ascend in the George  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
All parties tell me that your re-election is safe. I think you 
were wise in declining being a candidate for the office of Governor. Roman, I believe, will be elected. I think it the interest of our friends to unite on him. There is a good prospect of 
our returning those friends to the House of Representatives ; 
and yet I am not without fears that we may lose the majority in 
your Legislature. The city of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> is the pivot ; and 
it is extremely difficult there to animate our friends to proper 
exertion. It will be well for you to come here after the close of 
Congress. My cordial regards always to Mrs. Johnston.

My dear Sir, I reached this place this morning from Louisville. My passage from Natchez in the George  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> 
comprehended all the agreeable circumstances. Nothing could 
surpass the warmth of my reception in Mississippi. Both parties 
attended the dinner and ball at Natchez, and they vied with each 
other in their testimonies of respect. I had the satisfaction to 
make the acquaintance of Drs. Duncan and Mercer, with both 
of whom I was much pleased. 
</p><p>
I believe that I have not heretofore said to you, that I found in 
Louisiana an unanimous and strong opposition to the acquisition 
of Texas. Your brother is disinclined to offer at the next election for the Legislature. I endeavored to overcome his repugnance. I think he ought to be there, where he might essentially 
serve you. He has an excellent standing in the House. General Thomas will beat Ripley with ease for Congress, if those 
two only offer.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 14th ultimo, 
transmitted through a friend. It discloses a state of public 
affairs at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, both curious and mortifying. Your accounts and conclusions are substantially concurred in by other 
friends who write me. If the incompetency of the President 
could be manifested to the public, I have no doubt, with you, 
that his re-election would be impracticable. But how is that 
to be done? How, especially, will that large portion of it 
which contributed to place him where he is, be made to believe 
his unfitness? particularly when majorities in both Houses continue to support all, even his most exceptionable acts? 
</p><p>
I say, continue to support them. For I infer, from what I 
have seen, that the principle of removal, in its most odious 
form, has been sanctioned by the majority. What does the 
Senate believe will be thought of its dignity and independence, 
in after time, when it will sanction (as in the case of the 
Treasurer of the United States) the removal, without cause, of 
a high public officer, whose appointment it only a few months 
before approved? Does it imagine that the miserable sophistry 
of that pliant tool, Felix Grundy, will justify it? According to 
him, the Senate can not look beyond the mere question of fitness of the person nominated ; the President acts upon his responsibility, and there is no remedy but in impeachment ! Does 
he not see that he strips the body of one of its most important 
constitutional functions that of operating as a check upon the 
executive? Does he not see that the Senate, after making itself 
a particeps with the President in a dangerous and pernicious 
proceeding, will be a very unfit and unsafe tribunal to arraign 
him before for that identical proceeding? 
</p><p>
The consequence, I fear, will be, of this approbation in both 
houses of the worst acts of the President, that the Jackson portion of the public will be lulled into secm-ity, and believe that 
all is right. In this point of view, I have thought it of much 
importance that, when any great principle was involved (such 
as the appointment of editors, or removals without cause), the 
Senate would show itself worthy of the esteem which it once 
enjoyed, by putting itself against the evils to be dreaded. 
</p><p>
You perceive no effect, at a distance, from the state of things 
which you describe at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. Witness the result in New 
Hampshire. 
</p><p>
If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> really intends to set himself up in opposition 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, I should begin to think there was a prospect of some division that might lead to beneficial results. 
</p><p>
Do not imagine from any thing that I have said that I at all 
despair of the Republic. I only fear that the day of soundness 
and sanity is more distant than you believe. 
</p><p>
Mr. Chilton's last letter on the comparative expenditures of 
the two Administrations, like his first, will do good. 
</p><p>
I shall not disappoint my friends in remaining still. I shall 
remain more than ever at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, the occupations of which I 
relish more than ever. 
</p><p>
Daralde writes me that the Tariff resolution, which I informed 
you had passed the Senate of Louisiana unanimously, has passed 
the House with only seven dissentients. I sent yon a copy of 
the resolution, which I hope you received. 
</p><p>
I heard nothing more, after I wrote you, of Waggerman's opposition to you. I hope it will not take place. Our friends 
were very confident of your success, but ^''ou should go home 
after the session. Duralde thinks Roman will be elected Governor. 
</p><p>
I will thank you to remit me the amount you may receive 
from Mann, in a check of the office of Discount and Deposit, at

Dear Sir, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your very 
friendly letter of the 5th instant, and to thank you for the information which it contains, and for your kind endeavor to vindicate me from the aspersions to which I have been exposed on account of my public conduct. I have almost daily proofs of 
the general conviction which prevails of my having been 
wronged ; and I have full confidence that my fellow citizens 
will ultimately render me perfect justice. These good feelings 
were strongly manifested toward me during a late visit I made 
to Louisiana. Every where I was received with warmth and 
cordiality, and, in some instances, with enthusiasm. When the 
passions lately so strongly excited, shall subside, and the people 
come to reflect on the past, and to reason upon the promises made 
by or for the successful Presidential candidate, and the shameful 
violation of all of them at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, they can not fail to come 
to right conclusions.

I met Colonel Drake to-day and delivered him your message,

you are engaged, and for your individual prosperity.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 8th instant. I 
returned from Louisiana about three weeks ago. My visit to 
that State and to Mississippi, was full of gratification. Not a 
single painful incident occurred. Every where my reception was 
warm and cordial, and sometimes enthusiastic. The Legislature 
of Louisiana paid me a compHment, the more estimable because 
it was spontaneous, and without previous concert. When I unexpectedly attended it, the whole body (Speaker and all), without distinction of party, rose to receive me. While I was in 
that State, its Senate passed unanimously a resolution in favor of 
the Tarifli", which has since been concurred in by the House of 
Representatives, with only seven dissentients. Nothing could 
have surpassed the cordiality of my reception and entertainment 
at Natchez. At one of the largest public dinners I ever attended, 
I found myself in the midst of about equal numbers of both 
parties. A Jackson man sat on my right, an Adams man on my 
left. From all that I learned, I should think that the vote of Louisiana would certainly be given me against any one, and 
that of Mississippi against any one but Jackson. Against him 
also, if he continues, during the next two years, to lose his popularity there in proportion to his loss this last year. 
</p><p>
As to the state of things at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, you are probably as 
well, if not better informed than I am. My friends, prior to the 
recent nomination in Pennsylvania, were sanguine, extremely 
sanguine, of success. They represent great animosity as existing between the partisans of Calhoun and Van Baren, insomuch that each party prefers me to the other ; and that there are 
not thirty members of Congress who desire Jackson's re-election. 
</p><p>
Events which may have already happened, or which may 
occur in the course of the residue of the present session of Congress, will throw great light on the future. If the three great 
States of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York, should unite 
on any particular candidate, opposition to that candidate will 
be unavailing, in all probability. If there should be no such 
union, Jackson himself or either of the two prominent members 
of his party, may be beaten. Of the prospect of the supposed 
union, you can form as correct a conjecture as I can. 
</p><p>
Meantime I assure you, most sincerely, that I feel myself more 
and more weaned from public affairs. My attachment to rural 
occupation every day acquires more strength, and if it continues 
to increase another year as it has the last, I shall be fully prepared to renounce forever the strifes of public life. My farm is 
in fine order, and my preparations for the crop of the present 
year, are in advance of all my neighbors. I shall make a better farmer than statesman. And I find in the business of cultivation, gardening, grazing, and the rearing of the various descriptions of domestic animals, the most agreeable resources. 
</p><p>
I presume your new Constitution will be adopted. It has incorporated in it some very exceptionable elements of aristocracy. 
I should, nevertheless, vote for it, if I had a vote, as being, 
with all its defects, preferable to the old Constitution. I am curious to learn those anecdotes occurring at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, which 
you are afraid to intrust to the mail. I think a letter communicating them, put under cover to the Honorable R. P. Letcher, 
at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, would reach me in safety. I have never been 
able to comprehend <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison's</a> course. At a distance, it appeared to me marked by some inconsistency, which I regretted.

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, April 24,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1830">1830</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, Upon my return home from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, I 
found here your two favors of the 28th December last, and 6th 
ult. Although I met a vast accumulation of correspondence 
and of business, I should have immediately answered your letters but, to tell the truth, for my desire to see the issue of the 
elections in your Legislature. My anxious looks were directed 
toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, on account of yourself especially, and other 
friends. The papers have at length brought the intelligence I 
desired, and I offer you my cordial congratulations on your election, which, under all circumstances, is as honorable as I hope 
it will prove satisfactory to you. You are not, I remark again, 
appointed President of the Court, but, considering every thing, 
I do not think you should be mortified or even regret that the 
choice and the responsibility have fallen on a younger man. It 
would have given me inexpressible pain if I could have believed that your friendship to me, which has been of such long 
duration, and such great value, had affected you injuriously. 
</p><p>
Important events at home and abroad have happened since 
I last wrote you. These changes in Europe are so rapid that 
we have scarcely time to speculate on one before it is succeeded 
and supplanted by another. You will have heard probably by 
the time this letter reaches you, the decision of the question of 
a general war in Europe. I regret that such a war now seems 
to me almost inevitable. That regret will be diminished if we 
can remain at peace. But if there should be a general war, 
embracing England, she will make every endeavor to involve 
us in it. Such a purpose was openly avowed to me by men 
high in authority, when I was in England, on the contingency 
supposed. 
</p><p>
Among the incidents at home, the correspondence between 
the President and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Van Buren</a>, is perhaps the most important occurrence during the late session of Congress. I think it lowers 
them both, although confining our consideration to the parties 
to the controversy, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> must be allowed to have obtained the advantage. 
</p><p>
What course he may take in respect to the next election I am 
uninformed. From the knowledge I possess of his character 
and disposition, I believe he will be regulated altogether by his estimate of the probability of successful opposition to Jackson. 
If he thinks he can be defeated by himself or another, he will 
oppose his re-election directly or collaterally, according to circumstances. If he believes he can be defeated by no one, he 
will support his re-election, make a merit of a magnanimous sacrifice of his sense of his wrongs, and endeavor to enlist the 
gratitude and sympathies of the Jackson party to elevate himself hereafter. In any event, we can not fail to profit by the 
controversy. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> conduct, in respect to myself, surprised me. 
That he should, at the very period of holding such language 
toward me as he did in his letters, have been addressing letters 
to others containing the most improper expressions, betrays great 
duplicity. But, after his letter to me of March, in the last year, 
ought Ave to be surprised at anything he may do? I have never 
written to him since I received that letter, nor do I desire any 
correspondence with him again. I shall not, however, permit 
the publication of his letter of March. It could only be justified 
by some public good, and I see none that it would accomplish. 
The public feeling of Louisiana in regard to the President is all 
that we could desire. Not a doubt can be entertained of the 
vote of that State by any one acquainted with it. There have 
been numerous changes, and some of very influential individuals. 
In Kentucky, both parties are preparing for a vigorous campaign. 
Our friends are confident of carrying majorities both in the 
General Assembly and in the House of Representatives. I was 
so greatly mortified with the issue of our last August election, 
that I am unwilling either to indulge or inspire hopes. I can not, 
however, but believe that nothing but a corrupt and most extensive use of money can defeat us. Of that there is some reason 
to fear. 
</p><p>
As to the issue of the contest generally, my opinion remains 
the same that it has been for the last eighteen months. If Jackson loses either New York, Pennsylvania, or Virginia, he will be 
defeated. If he unites the votes of all three of those States, he 
will succeed. And I have generally supposed that the degrees 
of probability of loss to him of those States were in the order in 
which I have placed them. If I am right, he is most certain of 
Virginia. Of course I am unable to estimate the effect upon her 
of recent transactions, especially the correspondence and votes 
of your Senators. 
</p><p>
The movement in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> is strong and encouraging. It 
remains to be seen whether it will be seconded in other parts of 
the State. I am afraid it will be. In New York some progress 
has been made toward effecting an union of the various parties 
opposed to the present Administration, but the problem is yet to 
be solved whether such an union can be accomplished. 
</p><p>
The whole case presents one encouraging view. Jackson 
has lost, is losing, and must continue to lose. If the ratio of his 
loss hereafter shall equal what it has been in the two last years, 
he will be defeated. 
</p><p>
I am much pressed to visit the north this summer ; and although my judgment is opposed to any journey having a political 
object, or which might be construed into such an object, I have 
been somewhat shaken in my resolution by the great anxiety 
manifested. But I believe I shall resist it, and remain in Kentucky, where (will you believe it ?) I am likely to make an excellent farmer. I am almost tempted to believe that I have heretofore been altogether mistaken in my capacity, and that I have, 
though late, found out the vocation best suited to it. 
</p><p>
I received from our friend Call a very kind letter, and I have 
to request that you will ask him to consider this equally intended for his eye and your own. It has been a long time since 
I heard from him, but I see nobody from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> of whom I 
do not inquire about him ; and I learn from all that he retains 
generally his good spirits, and his attachments with great constancy ; of mine to him and you I pray you both to be fully persuaded.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 13th instant, 
communicating the rejection of Hill, and your expectation that 
Kendall will follow the same fate. This latter anticipation, from 
what others tell me, I apprehend, has not been realized. I attach some consequence to the rejection of these men. Who is 
the uncertain Senator? Is he from Indiana? If he be, it is to 
be attributed to his approaching election. If my information 
from that State be correct, he need not fear the issue, unless he* 
proves treacherous to our cause. 
</p><p>
I observe that you regard the movements of Harrisburg and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> as putting Jackson in nomination. They may bear that 
interpretation, but they are also susceptible of another. The 
terms in Vv^hich the two caucuses express themselves do not 
necessarily import the presentation of Jackson as a candidate. 
May not the movements be regarded as a stratagem of Van 
Buren to gain time, to disconcert his rival, to concentrate the 
Jackson party upon himself, and to come out, at a suitable time, 
as a candidate? 
</p><p>
Ask <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a> to show you a letter which I wrote him a 
few days ago, stating a proposition which I received from Mr. 
Crawford, and be pleased to regard that matter as strictly confidential, resting between you two. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, supposing 
him to be in the secrets of Yan Buren and his faction, does not 
appear, on the 31st of March, to have suspected that Jackson 
would be a candidate. 
</p><p>
You inform me that my friends contemplate taking some decisive measures in regard to me, before they separate. I shall 
acquiesce in whatever decision they may make. If Jackson 
should be a candidate, and can unite upon himself the three 
States of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York, opposition to 
him will be unavailhig. If either of those States can be detached from his support, I think he can be beaten. Whether 
that be practicable or not, you have better means, and are otherwise more competent to judge, than I am. * * * 
</p><p>
The disadvantage of delay, if we mean to act, is the uncertainty in which our friends among the great body of the people, 
are left. Already I have been frequently spoken to, and sometimes have been written to, to know if I am a candidate. Of 
course I give but one answer, which is, that I shall never present 
myself as a candidate.

Dear Sir, I received to-day your favor of the 29th ult. I 
had received from Mr. Yates a similar letter to that which he 
addressed to you, which I immediately answered, communicating 
all the information I could give him upon the subject to which it 
related. I therefore now return his letter to you, with the accompanying papers. 
</p><p>
There is not the smallest ground for the intimation which 
you have received of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> being disposed to decline 
in favor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>. On the contrary, there is the greatest 
animosity prevailing between these two rivals and their respective partisans. The late movements at Harrisburg and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, 
are well understood to have been prompted by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>, 
to arrest the progress which <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> was making with the 
Jackson party, and I have no doubt that they are not to be taken 
as evidence that Jackson will ultimately be a candidate. 
</p><p>
It is impossible that any reception could have been more 
warm and cordial than that which was given me below. 
</p><p>
I am very busy farming, to which I am becoming every day 
more and more attached.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favors of the 28th and 29th 
ult. I do not think that the object of Colonel Benton and 
Colonel Hayne, in detaching the West from New England, has 
been at all promoted by their speeches on Foote's resolution. It 
has been well understood, and I think has entirely failed. Hoavever extensively their speeches have been circulated, they have 
not been so widely or so generally read as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster's</a>, and 
his triumph in that matter has been complete. Great aid has 
been afforded to him by the speeches of Mr. Spragne and Mr. Holmes. We are waiting anxiously, however, to see yours, and 
I hope you will not omit to send me the proof-sheets promised 
by you. 
</p><p>
I am rejoiced at the passage in the House of Representatives, 
of the bill for the Maysville road. I sincerely hope, you are 
correct in your anticipation of the concurrence of the Senate. 
The South will of course be opposed to it. If, as I hope, the 
New England Senators shall generally vote for it, there will 
be a fine commentary upon Colonel Benton's text. We shall 
then be able practically to know who are our real friends. Give 
my respects to our friends from New England, and tell them not 
to deprive us of the benefit of this weapon. The road, considered 
as a section of one extending from the Muskingum or Scioto, 
through Kentucky and Tennessee, to the Gnlf of Mexico, is 
really of national importance. We observe that the New England delegation well entertained the measure in the House, and 
we trust that similar support will be given to it by her senators. 
</p><p>
I have much information from both ends of the State of New 
York. It substantially corroborates the letters which you sent 
me. There seems to be perfect chaos in that State, and no one 
now can see what will come of it. If the friends of the late 
Administration, the workingmen party, and the anti-masons, 
should unite, they will compose a majority. Is it not probable 
that they will? The anti-masons will bring out Granger. I 
should think that the friends of the late Administration would 
support him against Troop or Foote ; and even supposing those 
parties only were to co-operate, Granger would be elected. 
</p><p>
By the time of the close of the Tariff debate, which Mr. McDuffe, I suppose, has precipitated, you will have a clearer view 
of the whole ground. Its effect can not fail to widen the 
breach between the sections of the Jackson party. 
</p><p>
I have entire confidence in the discretion of my friends as to 
the course which they may mark out. If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> should 
be announced as a candidate, it will be clear. If not, the question will be as to the consequences of delay, or immediate action. The first part of it (delay) involves a consideration of the 
discouragement or separation of our friends which might ensue, 
and the second the concentration of all the fragments of the 
Jackson party upon Jackson, which might be the result. I shall 
be glad to hear from you soon.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received to-day your favor of the 30th ult., 
with the first part of the proof-sheets of your speech, which I 
have perused with much satisfaction. The editor of " The 
Reporter" promises to publish it in his next week's paper. With 
the candid its views will be regarded as large and liberal, and 
its vindication complete. 
</p><p>
I regret Hendrick's course. It was not necessary to secure, 
but may endanger his re-election. He was already distrusted in 
his State, but was forgiven, or rather there was a disposition to 
overlook his course, in consideration of the circumstances under 
which he was placed. But if he votes for the printers, I think 
it probable he will be abandoned. 
</p><p>
I am very anxious, as you may well suppose, about the passage of the Maysville bill. I hope our New England friends will 
not desert us in that measure. Their support of it will be worth 
a thousand of Benton's speeches.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, ^Your favor of the 10th instant was safely 
conveyed to me through the friendly channel to which you 
committed it, and I have perused its contents with much interest. The project of IVIr. Yan Buren, and his partisans in Virginia, of attaching that State to his support upon the ground of 
an overthrow of the Bank of the United States, I should suppose 
was frustrated, for the present, by the events which have occurred at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, on that subject. The President's message, in referring to it, committed two radical errors : First, it 
was premature ; and in the second place, he brought forward a 
rival institution, far wors« than the Bank of the United States 
can be supposed to be by its most violent enemies. A comparison has been naturally made between the two institutions, and 
the result of it has been every where the same. The reports 
of the two committees of Congress have been widely circulated, 
and have confirmed the unfavorable impression which that part 
of the message produced, when it was first published. It is too 
soon yet to entertain, much less decide, on the question of the 
renewal of the charter. We have yet to acquire the experience 
of five years, which may bring about important developments. 
The national debt will, in the meantime, be paid, the duties reduced, etc., etc. 
</p><p>
I have no intention of visiting the North, or any other place, 
this season, with any political object. I am urgently solicited 
to go to almost every quarter of the Union. If I were to yield 
to these entreaties, I should be perpetually traveling. My own 
judgment is decided, that I ought to go nowhere for any political purpose, but remain at home. Should I make any excursions 
this summer, they will relate entirely to business or to my 
health. 
</p><p>
I have received a most singular letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, of 
which I beg, however, you will speak to no one, as I can not 
but think, from the nature of the proposal which it contains, it 
indicates some want of self-possession. He says, that he perceives from the papers, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Van Buren</a>, and myself, will be run for the next Presidency ; that his friends also 
think of bringing him forward ; that no one candidate would be 
elected ; but that, if the contest be limited to the three first, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> would be finally elected by the House of Representatives ; that I should not get a vote in New England, which 
would support <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> ; and that all the South would go 
for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>. Therefore, he proposes that I should not be 
brought forward, but support him, whereby he would get the 
votes of all the Western States, which, with the aid of Virginia, 
North Carolina, Georgia, Delaware, New Jersey, and probably Maryland, with some few other States, would secure his election. 
Then, he says, I would, of course, come again into the cabinet, 
and finally succeed him ! He intimates that his friends may 
make a similar proposal to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>, but he prefers that I 
should accede to it. He supposes that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> will not 
be again a candidate. I have not answered this most extraordinary letter, which bears date the 31st day of March last. I shall 
not answer it. I could not answer it in terms consistent with 
the friendship which I once bore to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>. 
</p><p>
I think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> has sealed his fate by his recent vote 
for Kendall. He had previously boasted to some of my friends 
that he had constantly adhered to principle ; that he would still 
pursue it, and that he disapproved the system of proscription, 
and the appointment of editors, etc. Now it so happens, that a 
finer opportunity could not have occurred to test the sincerity of 
these declarations. Kendall was a printer, and, besides, a man 
of unenviable character. Yet, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>'s casting vote saved 
him ! I knew, weeks before the nomination was decided, that 
it depended upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>'s vote ; and, knowing him as 
well as I do, I stated to some of my friends what the issue would 
be. It is remarkable that, weeks before the event, Kendall 
wrote to some of his Frankfort correspondents, that, if the Senate was full, it would be equally divided, and that he would get 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>'s vote. This fact ought to be generally known. 
</p><p>
I perceive that your new Constitution is adopted. I noticed 
the provision in relation to the judiciary, both on account of the 
principle which it involves, and as it affected you. I most sincerely wish you may be re-appointed ; and, considering the stability which has generally characterized your State, I presume 
you will be. If you submit the question to the consideration of 
those who best know you, they will be unanimous for your reelection. Twenty years hence it will be time enough to talk 
of old age, and its too frequent concomitants. 
</p><p>
I have received several copies of the new edition of Algernon 
Sidney sent me by MR.White. I wish that the principles which 
they so eloquently illustrate and establish, could be every where 
diffused. Bolivar appears to be reading us a lesson on the same 
subject, which ought not to be lost. I hope you approved of my 
letter to him, recently published. 
</p><p>
As to the other publication to which you refer, I can not so 
well judge as you can, as to the most fit time of its appearance. 
 
</p><p>
I should, however, think that it would not be too early after the 
adjournment of Congress. 
</p><p>
I can not return this letter through the channel that you sent 
yours, for an obvious reason.

My dear Sir, I have just received your favor of the 26th 
ultimo. I had intended, this summer, to visit Black Rock,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saratoga" rel="city">Saratoga</a>, and New England. But I believe I shall decline it. I 
expect here my daughter and some friends from Louisiana, to 
pass some time with me, and that consideration, together with 
the interest which I now, more than ev^er, take in my farms, and 
the various occupations to which they give rise, will keep me 
here. I am at the same time very gratefel to yourself and other 
friends in New England for the desire to see me there. I reciprocate, cordially and sincerely, all their friendship ; and I have 
no doubt, if circumstances admitted of my going there, that I 
should every where find warm hearts and kind treatment. 
There is not a spot in the Union that I should visit with more 
pleasure; and I should be distressed if I did not hope that I 
may have that satisfaction at some not distant day. Whenever 
I shall be able to realize it, I will not fail to embrace your 
friendly invitation. 
</p><p>
I perceive by the last papers that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gmd" rel="colleague met">Mr. McDuffie</a> has at length 
opened the whole subject of the Tariff. Well, so much the 
better. The question was not to be avoided long, and I think 
our friends could not have met it at a more fortunate time. I 
presume you have read a capital little pamphlet reviewing Mr. 
Cambreleng's report. Ask our friend <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsj" rel="colleague friend met">Mr. Johnston</a> how it happened that the adhesion of Louisiana to the Tariff, which took 
place at the last session of its Legislature, has been nowhere 
published in the Eastern papers?

My DEAR Sir, I received your obliging letter of the 18th 
ultimo. I regret that the hope there expressed of defeating the 
Indian Bill was not realized. I have received and read with much profit and satisfaction, the speech you delivered on the 
occasion. It is much sought after, and I am sorry that more 
copies were not sent here. But two, that I know of, have 
reached us, and they have been in constant circulation. Mr. 
Smith will republish it as soon as he can get rid of the mass of 
matter upon the all-engrossing topic of the day the President's 
course on Internal Improvements. 
</p><p>
As to the Indian measure, I think our efforts should now be 
directed to the rejection of treaties negotiated in pursuance of 
that abominable law, and to the withholding of appropriations to 
carry it into effect. With that end, its flagitious character, the 
disgrace which it would bring upon our name and nation, and 
its enormous expense, should be spread fully before the people. 
We shall do much, I trust, in this quarter ; public meetings of 
the people are getting up in various places, at which spirited 
resolutions, on both the above subjects, will be adopted. 
</p><p>
The opposition founded on the inherent injustice of the Indian 
Bill will be increased here, in consequence of the expense which 
it occasions, being one of the pretexts for the course pursued in 
regard to Internal Improvements. 
</p><p>
The veto will also be assailed here, not for the purpose of destroying it, but so to amend the Constitution as to require only 
a majority of all elected instead of two thirds of each house. 
Such an amendment is, in my opinion, proper ; and if it be 
thought so by you, can you not aid us? I have concluded, after 
much consideration, that it is inexpedient for me to leave home 
this summer, except to go where business calls me. I should 
have been truly glad to have visited my friends at the North. 
My heart is with them. But waiving the matter of personal inconvenience, I am convinced that the public effect would not 
be good. I hope you will make this decision acceptable among 
the circle of your acquaintances.

My dear Sir, We are all shocked and mortified by the rejection of the Maysville road and other events occurring at the 
close of the late session. Meetings of the people are contemplated in several counties in this quarter, to give expression to 
public sentiment and feelings. At those meetings it has been 
suggested that the public sentiment may be expressed in terms 
of strong disapprobation of the act of the President. 2d. In 
favor of Internal Improvement. 3d. Disapproving Mr. Bibbs' 
conduct and recommending to the Legislature his recall. 4th. 
Approbation of Mr. Letcher, particularly, and of the other members who voted with him. 5th. Against the nullifying doctrines 
of the South. 6th. Against the re-election of Mr. Rowan, because he supports them, is opposed to Internal Improvements, and 
the Tariff, in opinion, and has supported the most obnoxious 
nominations. 7th. Proposing an amendment to the Constitution, 
substituting a majority of all the members elected to Congress, 
instead of two thirds, to pass a bill returned by the President. 
This is right I think, on principle. Your own reflections will 
suggest the immense advantages that we shall derive from supporting this amendment, while our opponents will oppose it. It 
is thought by my friends that these public meetings will furnish 
suitable occasions for making a nomination for the next Presidency, and recommending to the next Legislature to second and 
support it. They urge that this will be a popular measure, and 
not one of caucus agency. That the nomination connects itself 
naturally with the question of Internal Improvements. That 
the time has come. That Congress having adjourned, no counteracting measure can be adopted by members of Congress at 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. That other States look to Kentucky for the first 
movement. That it will have good effect on the August elections. That it can do no harm, and may do much good, etc. I 
think there is much force in these suggestions. Will you have 
a meeting in Macon? If you do it will have beneficial consequences that there should be as many meetings as practicable in 
adjoining counties. Let me hear from you ; and believe always 
that I am with constant and cordial regard yours, etc. 
</p><p>
P. S. My opinion is that, with powerful, bold', and decided 
action, much may be made of the events of the moment.

I am perfectly contented with the course my friends took at

</p><p>
The decisions of the President in respect to Internal Improvement have produced great effect in this quarter of Kentucky. 
The larger number of all who supported Jackson, in the circle 
of my immediate acquaintance, have left him. Few but desperate leaders remain to him. Measures have been devised, and 
are now in a train of execution, to give expression to public 
sentiment. It is contemplated to disapprove of the exercise of 
the Yeto, the Indian bill, etc, and to propose an amendment of 
the Constitution, requiring only a majority of both Houses of 
Congress (of all elected to each) to pass a bill returned by the 
President. I think such an amendment right, and I attach much 
importance to the discussion which it will provoke.

6th instant. In regard to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> strange letter, I could 
not answer it without violating the regard I once had for him 
and the respect due to myself, and therefore I did not answer it. 
I think his proposal was insulting and derogatory. I do not apprehend that the injury to me, which you fear from my silence, 
can accrue ; 1st, because he says in his letter '' Do not suppose 
that I feel any solicitude upon the subject of the letter. I feel 
none. But supposing from what I have seen in the public 
press that you may feel some, it occurred to me that the most 
certain mode of gratifying that feeling was to adopt the course 
which I have suggested. If you should be of a different opinion, let the matter rest where it is, and there will have been no 
harm done. On the contrary, should you concur in the suggestion I have made, I will be happy to hear from you as soon as 
leisure will permit." This, you will agree, is a strong manifestation of sang froid and disinterestedness. But it also evinces 
that no answer was expected in the event of my disapproval of 
the proposal, which he seems to have anticipated as possible. 
</p><p>
In the second place, I have communicated the contents of the 
letter, in confidence, to a sufficient number, to protect me against 
the presumption of any assent of mine, from my silence. Besides, there will be no sort of evidence, direct or collateral, of 
such assent. It seems to me, that when a base proposition is 
made, as I regard this, the most proper treatment of it is silent 
contempt. 
</p><p>
As to publishing his letter, although I feel no objection of 
honor or of confidence which forbids it, I incline to think that 
under all circumstances it had better not now be done. Mr. 
Crawford is not, nor likely to be, formidable. His friends, 
though few of them were mine, are generally respectable. 
Their feelings would be affected. He has been high in public 
confidence. Ought that to be shown as having been misplaced, 
especially as he may not be in his right mind? 
</p><p>
In regard to Blair's letter, I took some time ago public ground, 
from which I think I ought not to recede. I stated that I would 
not publish it, at the instance of Mr. Amos Kendall, but that it 
might be seen by any gentleman, and it was seen by many, and 
by him, though not of that number. The infamous story is now 
stale, and it can not be revived, even by Thomas Ritchie. I 
long since resolved to say nothing more to the public about it. 
I feared indeed that some portion of it [the public] may have 
considered me to have manifested too much sensitiveness concerning it. Such, I am sure, would be the judgment of many, 
if I were, in any form, again to present myself to the public re^^pecting that matter. 
</p><p>
Great sensation has been produced in this quarter about the 
President's course relative to Internal Improvements. Public 
meetings of the people, in various places, are about to be had, at 
which spirited resolves, etc., will be passed. They mean to attack the Yeto, by proposing an amendment of the Constitution, 
requiring only a majority of all elected to each branch of Congress, instead of two thirds of a house, to pass a returned bill. 
Such an amendment I think right. If Congress pass a bill on 
their own reasons, and again pass the same bill, after a full consideration of the reasons of the President in opposition to it, the 
bill ought to be a law. The policy of proposing such an 
amendment, in the present condition of parties, is obvious. If 
our opponents agree to it, it will be adopted. If they oppose it, 
we shall get the weather guage of them. Will you mention 
this matter to Pleasants? As he and others of my friends in 
Virginia approve of the recent exercise of the Veto, there may 
be some objection in espousing an amendment of the Constitution, which has been suggested by what we deem an abuse. 
But if, on principle, you should agree with us that the amendment is proper, it might be supported by you without reference 
to the late exercise of power.

My dear Sir, I received your obliging favor of the 13th 
instant, and, at the same time, the paper containing the proceedings of the meeting in Macon. I perused the preamble and 
resolutions with much satisfaction. They appear to me to be very appropriate and judicious. I find but one sentiment prevailing here in respect to the late popular movements in Kentucky, and that is, that they are very proper, must do good, and 
can do no harm. It was well enough, for a certain time, to 
leave the other party to its own divisions, but that time is now 
passed. The fact can not, and need not be concealed from that 
party, that an opposition will be made to the re-election of its 
chief. So far as that fact will prevent the creation of divisions 
in its ranks, that consequence will attend it whether we act or 
not ; and by not acting, I apprehend, more loss among our friends 
than gain among those of the other side. 
</p><p>
I have seen here many persons from New England and New 
York-, as well as all parts of this State. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wic" rel="colleague met">Mr. Creighton</a> has just 
got home, after having made the tour of the former, passing from 
the city of New York to Buffalo. Without troubling you with 
the details, the information derived from all these sources is highly 
encouraging. I shall leave this place in a few days to return 
home by the way of Cincinnati.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your letter of the 20th of July. A 
letter, purporting to have been written by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> to some 
manufacturer in Massachusetts, has been recently published ii^ 
the "Literary Subaltern." It first caught my eye in the public 
prints, when I was recently on my way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbus" rel="city">Columbus</a>, and I confess to you that I then had some doubts of its genuineness. 
They arose from two considerations, one of which was that it 
uses the terms American system, the first application of which, 
within my recollection, to the Tariff, was made by myself in 
my published speech on that subject in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a>"><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a></a>, posterior to the 
date of the letter. The other was, that, although it bore a 
strong resemblance to the style of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>, I thought it 
spoke with more explicitness in relation to the election to the 
Presidency of myself, than he would permit himself to do, in. 
respect to any person. I communicated these doubts to General 
Vance at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbus" rel="city">Columbus</a>, and to one or two other friends, before I 
saw the authenticity of the letter questioned in the public prints. 
I had even thought of indicating my suspicion to the public in 
some form ; but then I did not know but that the letter might 
be genuine ; and if it should prove to be so, my calling it in 
question would seem very strange. I therefore remained silent. 
Subsequent occurrences have tended to strengthen instead of 
removing the doubts. And I now fear that Mr. Southworth 
(with whom I have no personal acquaintance, although I think 
it probable I may have seen him) has acted improperly. He 
had before given me several occasions to regret his intemperate 
zeal. , 
 
Under- these circumstances, ought I to do any thing? Or to 
leave him to get out of the scrape as he can? 
</p><p>
One thing has occuri'ed to me, about which I wish to trouble 
you. The late Colonel T. M. Randolph, about three years ago 
attributed to MR.Jefferson some very disparaging opinions of 
me, and published them. I knew they were inaccurate at the 
time. I know that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> entertained friendly and favorable opinions of me, although I did not know the extent. And 
I know that Colonel Randolph greatly misrepresented the purport 
of a conversation between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> and me, in his presence, 
and in the presence of Governor Metcalf, who, although I have 
never spoken to him about it, I am sure would contradict Colonel Randolph. 
</p><p>
Shortly after the appearance of Colonel Randolph's statement, 
I received from his son, Thomas J. Randolph, a letter of M^hich 
the inclosed is a copy, addressed to me spontaneously. I could 
make no use of it during the life of the father, for obvious reasons. After his death, I obtained from the son permission to 
use it as I pleased, although I have never availed myself of it. 
I observe that the statement of Colonel Randolph is again relied 
upon to obviate the effect of the South worth letter. Now, it 
has occurred to me, that it may be useful to publish Mr. T. J. 
Randolph's letter ; and if you think so, I would be glad that 
you would obtain his second permission to publish it. It might 
then be stated in " The Whig," or some other paper, that it had 
obtained a copy of the letter, with authority to publish it. I 
should prefer, if published, that it should not appear as my act 
or to be done at my instance. 
</p><p>
The publication of this letter will destroy the effect of Colonel Randolph's statement, and prove that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> entertained friendly sentiments, although not the extent of them. 
</p><p>
Our elections are just over, and have secured us a majority of 
not less, on joint ballot in the Legislature, than twelve, and perhaps eighteen. They show that there is about five thousand in 
the whole State against Jackson, which would have been sv^^elled 
to from ten to fifteen thousand, if the direct question of the next 
Presidency had been before the people. Our majority in the 
Legislature would have been thirty, but for the operation of 
local causes, divisions, and the impossibility of making the 
Presidential question every where bear on the election. Mr. 
Rowan will be permitted to retire. 
</p><p>
The results in Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, so far as tsre have 
yet heard from them, are still more favorable. Benton's re-election is considered certain. 
</p><p>
P. S. Should you decide to publish the letter of Mr. T. J. R., 
perhaps, it will be better to make no allusion to the letter of Mr 
Southworth.

My DEAR Sir, I have received several letters from you, which 
I should have acknowledged, had I known where to address you. 
The last, from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, communicates the death of Mrs. 
Brown, an event which has filled us with affliction, although we 
were not altogether unprepared to expect it. To Mr. Brown it 
must have been irreparable. They had lived so long together, 
and entered so entirely into each other's pleasures, pursuits, and 
habits, that I fear he will hardly ever recover from the shock. 
He ought forthwith to leave  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> and travel. 
</p><p>
I have received a confidential communication that Senator 
Barnard has renounced Jacksonism, and, at a time when he may 
deem suitable, will exhibit evidence of his renunciation, I put 
you in possession of the fact that, if true, you may not be unapprised of it. Should it prove correct, the change may neutralize 
the loss of Marks, which, I suppose, is inevitable. We shall 
gain, I think, one Senator in Kentucky ; and there being now 
two to elect in Illinois (Mr. M'Lean is dead), if v^e are in good 
luck, we shall gain at least one there. On the other hand, I 
fear, from all that has reached me, Barton may not be re-elected. 
Ohio will re-elect Burnet, or some other friend. Indiana will 
re-elect Hendricks, or some less equivocal friend. On these data 
you can estimate the probable state of the Senate. 
</p><p>
Should the elections to the Legislature terminate favorably in 
New York (as some friends calculate), you may possibly get a 
friendly Senator there. Of that you will be able to judge by 
the time this letter reaches you. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole (let the issue of the New York election be 
what it may), I think the campaign of this year has not closed 
discouragingly. Great faults have been committed, but they are 
not exclusively confined to our side. In this State, the proposed 
Convention will take effect, and one of its best results, I hope, 
will be to guard us against future faux pas. 
</p><p>
My best regards to Mrs. Johnston.

My dear Sir, The same information communicated to you, and which is contained in your letter of the 5th instant, respecting the rupture between two high officers, has come to me from Nashville, pretty directly. I think, therefore, it may be presumed true. I should not be surprised if Jackson should denounce the nullifiers in his next message, and mount that hobby to regain his popularity. But what will what can the Vice-President do? South Carolina is rather too contracted a position for him to start from. Besides, he is not very secure in that. It appears to me that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Van Buren</a> has completely out-maneuvered him.
</p><p>
In regard to the attempt to turn out Duff, I can supply you with some facts which may throw light upon the object. Blair, of "The Kentucky Argus," is now on his way to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, with his family, to set up a new paper, and it is highly probable that the alternatives which the Jackson party mean to offer you, are Duff and Blair ! Will not their division admit your friends appointing some respectable editor? If not, I think it will be most expedient for them to present such an editor, and adhere to him to the last, without mixing in the contest between the above two. 
</p><p>
The divisions in New York have led, I perceive, to the issue that might have been anticipated : the triumph of the Jackson party in all the elections. 
</p><p>
I believe I mentioned to you, in a former letter, that Poindexter dined with me, and that he talks like an independent man, who felt that he was denounced, and was resolved to cling to principle.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, November 24,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1830">1830</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, I received your favor of the 18th inst., communicating a very full and satisfactory account of your late election, 
and of the causes which led to its results. Upon the whole, 
we have much reason to be satisfied with those results, although 
we may regret that our friends in the reserve did not bestir them 
</p><p>
selves more. On the subject of the operation of Anti-Masonry 
on the interests of our cause, respecting which you request my 
views, I will explain them very frankly. 
</p><p>
The leaders of Anti-Masonry are in the pursuit of power ; 
the great body of their party are endeavoring to remove what 
they honestly believe to be a great evil. The former would 
desire power, without regard to the means of acquiring it ; the 
latter seek it only as an instrument of effecting their paramount 
object. To accomplish this object they believe, and' their 
leaders industriously inculcate the belief, that a change of the 
administration of the actual Government (whether general or 
State) is necessary. Hence, in the Western reserve, and in 
Vermont, where our friends are in the majority, the Anti-Masons 
connected themselves with the Jacksonians to get hold of the 
Government, and to dispossess those who possessed it. For the 
same reason, in New York and Pennsylvania, when the Jackson 
party was in power, the Anti-Masons sought a coalition with our 
friends. If this coalition was not complete, and if the Anti- Masons did not succeed, it was not their fault. 
</p><p>
I think it may be assumed that whenever Anti-Masonry is in 
the minority, it will seek a connection with any other party, 
which, in the same place, is also in the minority. This will 
account for the various and apparently conflicting directions 
which it takes. It is only an apparent inconsistency, for the 
object every where is the same, the acquisition of power. 
</p><p>
In this respect, Anti-Masonry does not difler from any other 
party, for the natural tendency of all the divisions of a minority, 
is to cohesion. This will generally take place unless it is counteracted by some stronger feeling or sentiment than that of 
hatred to those in power, as was the case with a portion of our 
friends in the late New York election. 
</p><p>
I do not know that it is to be regretted that the Anti-Masons 
did not succeed in Pennsylvania and New York. If they had 
been successful, they would probably have brought out an AntiMasonic candidate for President. Still, if I had been in New 
York, with a right to vote, I should have given my suffrage to 
Granger. I will not now trouble you with the reasons. 
</p><p>
I regret that the failure of Mr. Granger is so well ascertained 
to have been, because our friends about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, and in the river 
counties, would not concentrate on him. Unless this circumstance should produce an alienation between our friends and the 
Anti-Masons, I should think we will ultimately obtain their support, for the following reasons : 
</p><p>
1. It is in conformity" with the general nature of minorities, 
already noticed, that they should vote with us, if they have no 
candidate of their own party. 
</p><p>
2. They agree with us as to the American System. 
</p><p>
3. They have been violently assailed in New York by the 
Regency. 
</p><p>
4. They believe that, although I am a Mason, that I have no 
bigotry, and that I have no very great ardor for the institution. 
</p><p>
5. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> has, as they think, persecuted them, 
which they believe I should not do, as most certainly I should not. 
</p><p>
I can hardly believe that they will now present a Presidential 
candidate, although they still talk about it. Immediately after 
the election in New York, Mr. Ward (the editor of the "AntiMasonic Review") told a friend of mine that they could not 
support me, and would present a candidate of their own, etc. 
The next day he called on that same friend, and informed him 
that the Executive Committee of the Anti-Masons had resolved , 
1st. That the late election in New York had shown that they 
could not directly support me : 2d. That it be recommended to 
the convention at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, to nominate an Anti-Masonic candidate ; and 3d. That the papers of the party in New York, be 
advised to abstain from attacking me, and to conciliate my friends. 
</p><p>
If there be an Anti-Masonic candidate, I am inclined to think 
that it would operate in Pennsylvania and New York, more 
against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> than me, should we both be the candidates, while in your State, it would operate more against me 
than him. In that contingency, should our friends in New York 
and Pennsylvania unite with the Anti-Masonic party, Jackson 
would probably lose one or both of those States, in either of 
which cases I think he would be defeated. 
</p><p>
What I think not unlikely, is, that this time two years hence, 
the Anti-Masonic party will present in New York a candidate 
for Governor, without any electors for President and Vice-President, and that our friends will offer these, without any candidate 
for Governor. Upon that supposition, if there be concert between 
the two parties, each would succeed in its object. I do not 
know that any such arrangement has ever been thought of. 
None such has ever been suggested to me, and I infer it only 
from the natural operation of causes. 
 
I am inclined to think, upon the whole, that a conciliatory 
course on our part, toward the Anti-Masons, is wisest. There 
is no occasion for our friends to attack them. Let us leave that 
to the Jackson party. 
</p><p>
We shall have some trouble about a Senator, though I yet 
think we shall succeed in the election of a friend. I have 
been pressed of late to offer. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>' example is quoted. 
But both my feelings and judgment are strongly opposed to my 
return to Congress. Nothing but a contingency, which I sincerely hope may not arise, would overcome them.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I believe I am in arrears to you, and that I 
omitted to answer your last, in which you requested me to say 
something on French affairs. Events followed in such rapid 
succession, that I had no time, except to put in a flying shot, 
which seemed to me hardly necessary. I sincerely hope that 
the work, so gloriously begun, will be happily consummated. 
They have two dangers : the first, in retaining a Bourbon on 
the throne, which they thought ought to be done to conciliate 
foreign powers ; and the second, the humane desire to screen 
the former ministers from punishment. It would have been 
better to have suffered the law to proceed against them, and to 
have forborne the offer of the project of abolishing capital punishments until it had pronounced its sentence. It would have 
been better not to have mixed the two subjects together, or not 
to have given color to such an imputation. After their conviction, if convicted, I think it would have been easier to have commuted the punishment for banishment, or some other milder 
form. As to Belgium, the rock on which I feared the French 
Government would split, they appear to me to have acted discreetly. Belgium will ultimately go to France, unless a totally 
new way of thinking has taken place since I was there. 
</p><p>
But I did not commence to write you now on French affairs. 
Perhaps, before my letter reaches you, some new and important 
turn may have taken place in them. 
</p><p>
My object was to say to you, that I go in a day or two to 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, to pass a portion of the winter there with Mrs. 
Clay, and to request you to let me hear from you at that city. 
</p><p>
I am extremely" anxious to know how your Legislature disposes 
of the Judiciary, or rather, Judges. In these late times of political trouble and strife, nothing. has distressed me so much as 
the suffering of my friends, and I have feared that they would 
make a victim of you on my account. Do let me know what 
may be done. 
</p><p>
The political events of the year, taken altogether, are not discouraging. Except in Maine and New York, they justify strong 
hopes of the future. And in New York, so far as the election 
of Governor was concerned, it is far from certain that the issue 
should be regretted. 
</p><p>
In this State, the Legislature has not yet appointed a Senator. 
Our friends are in good spirits, and count upon success. But 
the vote will be a close one, owing to the fact that five or six 
members, opposed to the Administration, believe themselves 
pledged to vote for a Jackson Senator. It is not impossible that 
no election will be made this session.

My dear Sir, Prior to the receipt of your favor of the 17th 
ultimo, I had written you a long letter, which I hope will safely 
reach you. I infer from your last a determination to accept your 
recent appointment. I think you ought to accept it, and I should 
regret that you did not. Under all circumstances, it was an 
honorable testimony. I share with Messrs. Johnson and Leigh 
in their disappointment in not getting Mr. Stanard on the bench ; 
and I concur with them in the superiority which they assign to 
him over his successful competitor.

We live in an age of revolution. Who could have imagined 
such a cleansing of the Augean stable at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>? a change, 
almost total, of the Cabinet. Did you ever read such a letter as 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>'s? It is perfectly characteristic of the man a 
labored effort to conceal the true motives, and to assign assumed 
ones, for his resignation, under the evident hope of profiting by 
the latter. The "delicate step," I apprehend, has been taken, 
because, foreseeing the gathering storm, he wished early to secure a safe refuge. Whether that will be on his farm, or at 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, we shall see. Meantime, our cause can not fail to be 
benefited by the measure. It is a broad confession of the incompetency of the President's chosen advisers, no matter from 
what cause, to carry on the business of the Government. It is a 
full admission of that unfitness of those advisers for their respective stations, which the whole country felt when they were first 
selected. And if, as I presume, Ingham and Branch were dismissed, or compelled to resign, further dissentions must be sown 
in a party on the verge of dissolution. 
</p><p>
Nor can the injury to his cause be repaired by any successors 
to the vacant places, whom the President may call around him 
certainly not by those whom rumor designates. Edward Livingston to be Secretary of State a recorded defaulter to an 
enormous amount the re viler of Jefferson, whom he pursued 
in his retirement with a malicious and vexatious suit a man 
notoriously destitute of all principle. Louis McLane to be Secretary of the Treasury a man who glories in his federalism, 
to be appointed by the Republican party one whose degrading 
supplications, at the Court of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, for a worthless privilege, 
must have disgusted every man who was not insensible to the 
honor and dignity of his country. 
</p><p>
I expressed, in my former letter, my conjectures as to the 
course of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>. Late events, tending to show the great 
probability of the defeat of Jackson, may now determine him to 
take bolder and firmer ground against the President. The occurrence at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> is certainly not intended or calculated 
to subserve <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>. The rumored successors will all be 
adverse to him. I understand that Judge Smith was one of the 
advisers of the President in respect to the recent change, and he 
will advise nothing which can promote <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>'s views. 
Thus situated, the Vice-President may declare, or cause himself 
to be declared, a candidate, or aid, without such declaration, any 
and every opposition to the President. Unless I am deceived as 
to his strength, he will not be a candidate himself, but will push 
forward, most probably. Judge McLean. I observe a hint of 
such a purpose, on the part of his friends, in  "The Whig." 
I long since learned that there was (what shall I call it? a bargain ?) between the Judge and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, an understanding that he of the two was to be supported who could command the greatest probability of success. 
</p><p>
I observe what you state, as to the impression, in regard to 
my constitutional principles, which Mr. Ritchie has made on the 
Virginia public ; but I can not concur with you as to the utility, 
at this time, of any publication about them, from myself, in any 
form. If I am not now understood by the public, nothing that 
I could say, during the pendancy of a warm canvass, would make 
me intelligible, and I must submit to any misconception of me 
which may, unfortunately, prevail. I need not say to you that 
my constitutional doctrines are those of the epoch of 1798. I 
am against all power not delegated, or not necessary and proper 
to execute what is delegated. I hold to the principles of Mr. 
Madison, as promulgated through the Virginia Legislature. I 
was with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison</a> then ; I am with him now. I am against 
all nullification, all new lights in politics, if not in religion. 
Applying the very principles of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison's</a> famous interpretation of the Constitution, in the Virginia address, I find in the 
Constitution the power to protect our industry, and to improve 
our country by objects of a national character. I have never 
altered my constitutional opinion which I ever entertained, and 
publicly expressed, but that in relation to the bank ; and the experience of the last war changed mine, and almost every other 
person's, who had been against the power of chartering it. 
Such are my views, but I will not consent to any publication of 
them, under existing circumstances, if I were even sure of achieving the conversion of my old friend Ritchie, who, by the by, 
knows them perfectly well. 
</p><p>
I adhere to my opinion, that there is no sufficient public reason, at this time, for publishing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> letter. I should 
be glad that that of Mr. T. J. Randolph could be published, without any direct agency of mine ; but if it can not be so published, 
I must acquiesce. 
</p><p>
What am I to do with the perpetual importunities to visit the 
North, etc., etc.? My judgment is against all and every excursion for, or which might be fairly construed to have in view, mere political effect. But I should like to be fortified or corrected by the opinion of yourself and other Virginia friends.

Mr DEAR Sir, I received both of your favors of the 15th 
ult., from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and of the 26th from St. Julien. I should 
be very happy to meet you in August at the White Sulphur Springs and  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lewisburg" rel="city">Lewisburg</a> ; but I believe I shall find it necessary 
to remain this summer in Kentucky. My private affairs require 
some portion of my time. I have several Executorships also to 
close, and I wish to avail myself of the leisure I can command 
this summer to settle them. 
</p><p>
I regret that I have not a copy of the pamphlet of Mr. Livingston to which you refer. I will endeavor to procure one 
from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>. Lately I have seen extracts from it, in which 
the author speaks very harshly of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>. 
</p><p>
I should be very glad if you could obtain the consent of Mr. 
T. J. R. to the publication of the letter, but I fear his apprehensions will lead him to withhold it. 
</p><p>
Can you not, when at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lewisburg" rel="city">Lewisburg</a>, extend your journey this far? I should be delighted to see you here, and beg you will come, if it be possible.

Dear Sir, I received your favor of the 31st ultimo, with the 
newspaper communicating the death of our friend Colonel Rochester. I offer you my sincere condolence on that afflicting 
event. To his family and numerous friends it is no small alleviation that he lived to a ripe old age, honored and beloved, and 
dies with the deep and general regret of all who knew him, as 
the " Rochester Gazette" truly testifies. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the improvement in the price of wool, 
and the consequent encouragement to the cultivation of sheep. 
I received for my common wool, unwashed, 33 cents, and was 
offered 62 for my merino, washed on the back of the sheep. 
</p><p>
A lame ram of mine was left the summer before the last with, 
I think, a Mr. Foreman, in your neighborhood, and I have never 
since heard of him. Will you be good enough to apply for the 
ram, if living, and use him this fall if you want him?

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 12th instant. I 
believe I have answered all your previous favors, although my 
last, at the date of yours, had not, I suppose, reached you. In 
that I informed you that I could not visit' Le wish urg. It would 
have afforded me very great satisfaction to have been able to 
visit it, on account of yourself and other friends whom I should 
have met there, or at the Springs ; but it will not be in my 
power. Can you not come here, when you will, at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lewisburg" rel="city">Lewisburg</a>, 
have penetrated so far to the West? I assure you that we would 
give you a warm and cordial reception, if you would visit us ; 
and I hope you will be able and inclined to do so. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to have troubled you with Mr. T. J. Randolph and 
his letter. Certainly their prudence is much to be admired. As 
it is but a small affair, I beg you to desist from the pursuit of it, 
if you encounter any further obstacle. I am not insensible to 
the value of the good opinion of his grandfather, as I desire indeed to deserve and possess that of all men. His father bore 
evidence, which was widely promulgated, of an unfavorable 
opinion entertained of me by his grandfather. He voluntarily 
contradicted it in a private letter to me. During his father's 
lifetime, from considerations of delicacy, I did not desire the 
publication of the contradiction. After his (lather's) death, he 
expressly permitted it. If he now refuses the publication, and 
chooses to allow his father's erroneous testimony to stand unrefuted, I must, without repining, acquiesce in the decision. 
</p><p>
Our flattering prospects in Kentucky daily increase, instead of 
declining. And letters which reach me from all quarters of the 
Union (the four Southern Atlantic States excepted) exhibit a 
tone of the greatest confidence. Anti-Masonry seems to be the 
only difficulty now in the way of certain success, both in Pennsylvania and New York. I have been urged, entreated, importuned, to make some declaration, short of renunciation of masonry, which would satisfy the Antis. But I have hitherto declined all interference on that subject. While I do not, and 
never did, care about Masonry, I shall abstain from making myself any party to that strife. I tell them that Masonry or AntiMasonry has, legitimately, in ray opinion, nothing to do with 
politics ; that I never acted, in public or private life, under any 
Masonic influence ; that I have long since ceased to be a member of any lodge ; that I voted for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, no Mason, against 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, a Mason, etc. « 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rir" rel="colleague friend met">Mr. Rush</a>, among others, has urged me to make some declaration. Notwithstanding his late impassioned address, he is firm 
in his devotion to our cause, and, I think, is worthy of all confidence. I do not believe that he would accept a nomination for 
the Presidency from the Antis, nor that he would allow of any 
use of his name prejudicial to me. 
</p><p>
How Anti-Masonry will finally operate is an important question. They may, and probably will make a nomination at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, in September, of some person who is not a Mason. They 
can not nominate Calhoun, on account of his political principles. 
They will not nominate <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Van Buren</a>. If they nominate Rush, I 
think he will not accept the nomination. It is said that Judge 
M'Lean will not. Granger they intend to run as Governor of 
New York. If they do make a nomination which shall be accepted, I think they will, before the next spring, discover how 
hopeless it is, and abandon it virtually, if not formally. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, I do not apprehend ultimately any serious mischief from it.

Dear Sir, The same anxiety displayed by our friend. Mr. 
Rochester, as evinced in the extract from his letter which you 
were good enough to send me, in regard to the pending Kentucky elections, pervades our friends throughout the Union. 
And I do believe that, if they should result, as we hope and believe they might be made to result, the Presidential contest 
would, in effect, be decided. My information as to our prospects in the State is highly flattering. Still no energy or exertion ought to be spared that can be thrown into the canvass. I 
concur with you fully in the efficiency of the plan suggested 
by you for bringing out the voters, and hope you will have it 
carried into effect in your quarter. Such a proceeding is contemplated here, and it will be also suggested to the Central Committee. 
</p><p>
We can not tell, at this distance of time and theater, how the 
Anti-Masonic excitement will result. Should they make a nomination in September, their first difficulty will be to prevail on 
any prominent person to accept. I am quite sure, from the tenor 
of recent letters from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rir" rel="colleague friend met">Mr. Rush</a> to me, that he will not. I have 
heard that Mr. M'Lean would not. They can not nominate Calhoun, without utter ruin to themselves. But if they should succeed in getting some prominent person to stand, I think, before 
one year, they would discover the hopelessness of the effort, and perceive that perseverance might be highly injurious. As 
between Jackson and me, I have every reason to count upon their preference.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, According to the wish expressed in your letter of the 2d instant, duly received, I transmit a copy of Mr. 
Randolph's letter to me. I have another from him, written subsequent to his father's death, on which, however, I have not 
been able to lay my hands, in which he expresses his consent to 
ray publication of the letter now sent. Notwithstanding, if there 
be any objection now existing to its publication, on his part, I 
do not desire it to be done. 
</p><p>
I have been much importuned to make some declaration in regard to Masonry (not a formal renunciation or denunciation), 
"which would conciliate and satisfy the Anti-Masons. I have 
declined to do so, and shall not depart from this resolution. I 
think it best not to touch the subject. Principle and policy are 
both opposed to my meddling with it. At the same time I believe it vv'ould be politic to leave the Jackson party exclusively 
to abuse the Antis. 
</p><p>
Information has reached me, in which I confide, that about 
one hundred of the most prominent Jacksonians in and about 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, have addressed the hero, and requested him not to 
run again. He had not answered them at my last dates.

Harrodsburg, July 23,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1831">1831</a>. 
</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, In passing through  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> from my residence, yesterday, to this place, where I purpose spending a few 
days, I received your favor dated at the Balize, and sincerely 
hope that this letter may find you safe in port. I should have 
written you before, as at Louisville I intimated I would do, but 
you appeared to be in such constant motion in Louisiana, that I 
did not know how to take you on the wing. 
</p><p>
Of the events at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> which have occurred since I saw 
you, I need say but little. Every one, fond of his country, 
must have seen them with mortification and regret. The only 
consolation deducible from them is, that they may contribute to 
dispel the delusion which placed those in power who have occasioned them. 
</p><p>
I think we are authorized, from all that is now before us, to 
anticipate confidently <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>'s defeat. The question 
of who will be the successor, may be more doubtful. The 
probabilities are strongly with us. It seems to me that nothing 
can disappoint the hopes of our friends, but Anti-Masonry. If 
that party should nominate a candidate at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, and adhere 
to him, they may prevent any election by the colleges, and possibly may lead to the election of the present incumbent. I believe they will make a nomination of an Anti-Mason. The wish 
of many of them, I understand, has been to make such a nomination, and then, that the person designated should decline. 
Accordingly an application was made to Judge M'Lean, to sound 
him, and to the surprise of the party he has expressed, it is said, 
a willingness to accept the nomination ! »This has produced 
embarrassment. Whether they will now nominate the Judge, 
or some person not so accommodating, remains to be seen. 
Should they nominate <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rir" rel="colleague friend met">Mr. Rush</a>, I presume he will decline. 
This gentleman has written me several letters since the publication of his famous address, in all of which he has expressed the 
strongest sentiments of attachment and friendship to me. His 
main object in them was to prevail upon me to make some declaration against Masonry, which would satisfy and conciliate the 
Antis. I was opposed to it, both upon principle and policy. I 
was opposed, not exclusively upon Masonic, but also upon other 
grounds. I think we ought not to admit the right of mixing 
Masonry or Anti-Masonry, or any other society, whether literary, 
benevolent, or religious, with politics. I concluded, and so informed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rir" rel="colleague friend met">Mr. Rush</a>, not to touch the subject, but to stand still. 
Reflection since has confirmed my resolution. 
</p><p>
Should the Antis make a nomination, as supposed, in September, of an Anti-Mason for the Presidency, it will be an 
interesting question what course our friends ought to take m 
relation to it in New York and Pennsylvania, I submit some 
observations : 
</p><p>
I think our friends in New York erred, last summer, in not 
hoisting their own colors. The consequence was, that, as a 
party, they acted with no concert, neither with the Antis nor 
with the Regency, exclusively, but with both. They got the 
gratitude of neither. What is more, the Antis were more embittered by the loss of some eighteen or twenty thousand of our 
friends, than they were gratified by their gain of upward of 
sixty thousand of them. And they obtained these sixty thousand as a clear addition to their own ranks, or, in fact, so many 
Antis. The further consequence was, to exhibit a great nominal increase of Anti-Masons since the election of the previous 
year. This apparent augmentation has had the effect of extending the Anti-Mason principle to other States, which had before 
been almost exempt from it. If, last fall, Anti-Masonry had, in 
New York, been restricted to its own legitimate numbers, it 
would now be less formidable there, or any where else, than 
it is. 
</p><p>
We are taught by past errors what to do in future. That, I 
think, ought to be done this fall which was omitted the last. 
Our standard should be raised, whatever may be the number, 
small or great, flockijig to it. There may then be in New York 
and Pennsylvania, three distinct tickets. Three consequences 
will ensue : First, that the Anti-Masons will be reduced to 
their proper numbers, and be taught by the reduction, moderation ; secondly, that the Jackson party may be the strongest of 
the three ; thirdly, by union, that the Jackson party may be defeated, whereas, by division between the Antis and the National 
Republicans, the Jackson party may succeed. And if the canvass should be conducted in a conciliatory manner by our friends 
toward the Antis (which policy evidently enjoins), this final 
consequence next fall may follow : that they (the Antis) will 
then come to our support. 
</p><p>
The policy of the Antis is to force us into their support. 
Ours should be to win them to ours. Taking the Union at 
large, we are certainly the strongest party. Taking any single 
State in the Union (New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, for 
example), we are the strongest party. Upon the laws of gravitation, we ought to draw them to us, instead of being drawn to 
them. They and we agree as to every thing the general Government can or ought to do. We differ only about Masonry, 
respecting which the general Government has nothing to do. 
In what part of the Federal Constitution can they find any warrant or authority to put down Masonry? If they, by a pursuit 
of the delusive object which, as it respects federal politics, they 
are prosecuting, should endanger the safety, or occasion the loss 
of great political principles, they will incur a great responsibility, 
and an overwhelming odium. 
</p><p>
I would not abuse them ; I would not even attack them. I 
would leave that to the Jackson party. 
</p><p>
Such are my general views on this perplexing question. 
</p><p>
We are on the eve of our great Kentucky contest. I think 
we shall achieve a signal victory. As to the Legislature, we 
can not fail. But such is the arrangement of the Congressional 
Districts, and so nicely are many of them balanced, that we 
may be deceived as to some. Yet I believe we shall gain, at 
least, seven or eight out of the twelve. Prodigious efforts, seconded by a vast expenditure of money, are making from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> ; and if we fail, it will be because the power of corruption 
is superior to the power of truth. Be pleased to make my best 
regards to Mrs. Johnston.

</p><p>
Olympian Springs, August 15,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1831">1831</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I avail myself of the conveyance afforded by 
a passing traveler to drop you a few lines in respect to our recent 
elections. 
</p><p>
I have not seen all the returns, but the results of enough are 
ascertained to enable me to say, that we shall certainly have the 
majority in the Legislature, and consequently will elect the 
United States Senator. As to the members of the House of 
Representatives, we have heard of the election of five of our 
friends. There are opposite rumors as to the sixth. If he be 
elected, the parties will probably stand six to six. Two years 
ago they were ten to two. 
</p><p>
The most extraordinary efforts have been made by the general 
Government to carry the election ; and there is reason to believe 
</p><p>
that, in some instances, highly improper means have been employed. For example, in the comity of Floyd, composing a part 
of the district from which I now write, where, in the contest between Daniel and Trimble, the vote was nearly equally divided, 
Daniel obtained a majority of upward of three hundred votes 
out of six or seven hundred. That county is in the mountains 
of Sandy, the most eastern county of the State. It is almost 
inaccessible. Yet an engineer of the United States arrived there 
in seven days from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, on the 27th ultimo, just four 
days before the election, upon a service of reconnoissance, to effect objects of internal improvement. It is strongly suspected 
that he used some efficacious instruments. In every other county 
of the district, Daniel lost upon the vote between him and Trimble ; other parties in the recent contest received respectively 
about the same support that was given on that occasion. But 
in Floyd, Daniel got the majority that has been stated. That 
extraordinary majority is believed to be the result of extraordinary causes. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, the issues of our late elections ought, perhaps, 
to be deemed satisfactory.

would not have been more than two or three Jackson members 
elected to Congress.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, T was rejoiced to learn, by your letter of the 
4th ultimo, that both your health and spirits were good. I hope 
they have so continued, and may long remain. 
</p><p>
I have received no letter from Mr. Randolph lately. I do not 
think it worth while longer to press him on a point which he 
evidently evades. 
</p><p>
It appears to me to be right that I should put you in possession 
of at least a brief outline of the policy which I think adapted to 
the present state of the country. This I do, not for the purpose 
of publication, but that you may have the means of correcting 
any error that may fall in your way as to my real opinions. 
Such a correction might also, if necessary, be made in " The 
Whig ;" not, however, to be done at my instance, nor upon 
my authority. 
</p><p>
I agree with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, that the next session of Congress is 
a suitable time for such a modification of the Tariff as is called 
for by the near approach of the payment of the public debt. 
The modification may be prospective, to take effect on the happening of that event ; or, if there be any particular article, the 
duty on which is burdensome, there might, as to that duty, be 
an immediate reduction, or abolition. There is a great advantage to merchants, as well as to consumers, to have adequate notice of a change in the existing Tariff". The Executive, too, 
might avail itself of the contemplated and distant alteration, to 
secure, in consideration of it, more favorable terms of commercial intercourse with foreign nations. 
</p><p>
There ought, I think, to be a dispensation with duties to an 
amount, after the payment of the public debt, equal to the sinking fund of ten millions, which are annually appropriated to 
that object. This should be effected by an abolition or reduction of duties on articles not coming into competition with the 
produce of our agriculture, or the fabrics of our manufacturers. 
In other words, I think the principle of protection should be 
preserved unimpaired, in its application to our domestic industry ; but, at the same time, that no more revenue should be collected than is necessary to an economical Administration. Laws ought to be passed to enforce strict execution of the Tariff, by 
defecting and punishing all evasions. An arrangement of the 
Tariff upon the principles stated, would be in conformity with 
what was always admitted by Southern statesmen, that is, that 
protection might be incidentally afforded in the collection of 
revenue. 
</p><p>
I have no idea of the propriety of laying or continuing duties for the purpose of accumulating surpluses. And as to the 
doctrine of distributing any such surpluses among the several 
States, I think there is not the slightest authority for it in the 
Constitution. The general Government can no more devolve 
upon the States the duty of discharging any one of its own 
powers than the States can delegate to the general Government, 
without an annulment of the Constitution, the duty of local or 
municipal legislation. 
</p><p>
In regard to internal improvements, I never have thought 
or contended, that a single cent of duty ought to be laid or continued for their promotion. I believe the power is possessed by 
the general Government. In any prudent adjustment of the 
Tariff to produce a revenue, say of twelve millions, sound policy requires that a deficit should be guarded against by laying 
duties enough. In some years, owing to the fluctuations of 
commerce, there may be a surplus, which might not be wanted. 
Such an occasional surplus, I would apply to the purpose of internal improvements. 
</p><p>
But the great resource on which I think we should rely for 
that object, after the payment of the public debt, is the proceeds 
of the sales of the public lands. There is an obvious fitness in 
such an appropriation. And I think that a more liberal application to the Western States ought to be made, of this fund, than 
to the others, for two reasons ; 1st. That the public domain is 
there situated, and improvements in that quarter have a tendency 
to enhance the value of the unsold residue ; 2d. As a sort of 
counterbalance to the expenditures on a navy and fortifications, 
which are for the more immediate benefit of the maritime frontier. It is true^ that each part of the Union is concerned in the 
safety and prosperity of every other part. But this interest is 
sometimes only indirect. The maritime States would have 
quite as much of this indirect interest in internal improvements 
made under the authority of the general Government, in the 
West, as the Western States would have in Eastern fortifications 
and a navy. But I would leave the consideration of what is 
due to the Western States, from the above views, to the enlightened sense of Congress. 
</p><p>
I think the Charter of the Bank of the United States ought to 
be renewed upon equitable conditions. I am perfectly willing 
to abide by the reasons which I assigned for a change of my 
opinion (the only change of opinion I ever made on a great political question) relative to that institution, and which are to be 
found in my published speeches. 
</p><p>
I have thus hastily sketched my views of the policy which is 
applicable to the present condition of our country. I repeat 
that they are not intended for publication, nor, for reasons which 
will readily occur to you, do I wish any copy of this letter given 
to any one, for any purpose. 
</p><p>
The doings of the Anti-Masonic Convention at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, 
have not yet reached us. From all I have heard, I presume 
Mr. M'Lean, of Ohio, has been nominated. I do not believe 
that he has the moral courage to accept the nomination. But, 
to quote from your neighbor, 7ioiis verrons. If the alternative 
be between Andrew Jackson and an Anti-Masonic candidate, 
with his exclusive prescriptive principles, I should be embarrassed in the choice. I am not sure that the old tyranny is not 
better than a new one. That can endure, at the furthest, only 
four or five years more, while the latter might be of indefinite 
duration. The one is an exhausted volcano, the other would 
be the bursting of a new eruption, spreading no one can tell to 
what extent, nor how long it would last. 
</p><p>
I believe, either that Mr. McLean will not accept, or, if he 
does, that he will be ultimately abandoned, from the impracticability of his election, in which case the great body of the AntiMasons will support me, not because they love me, but- because 
they hate Jackson more, and because there is greater coincidence 
between their political principles and mine. 
</p><p>
You suggest the propriety of publishing an extract from a letter you addressed to me, disclaiming any wish for a federal appomtment in any contingency. I have seen nothing which questions your disinterestedness ; and, therefore, why make the 
publication? Might not such a publication be deemed a gratuitous and unnecessary display? I request your reconsideration. 
</p><p>
I am glad that Virginia resolves to be represented in the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> Convention. Whatever doubts might originally have existed about the policy of that movement, it has now proceeded 
too far to be abandoned. And it is therefore desirable that 
there should be a full and respectable assembly. 
</p><p>
I am strongly urged to go to the Senate, and I am now considering whether I can subdue my repugnance to the service.

My dear Sir, I have received your favor of the 7th instant. 
That to which it refers was not received by me until after my 
return from Ilh'nois, and after my election to the Senate. As 
this latter event brought me nearer to you, I concluded to postpone writing until I reached this citj^, and even now I have nothing material to communicate which the papers do not present. 
Parties have not yet exhibited their respective strength ; nor, 
except the election of Speaker, has there been any occasion for 
its display. In that instance, there was evidently no concert 
between those opposed to the Administration ; and such a concert I apprehend to be extremely difficult, if not impossible. 
You will have seen from the message, and from the reports of 
the Secretary of the Treasury, and his colleagues, that the entire policy of the Government, in relation to every one of the 
great interests of the country, is proposed to be changed. Was 
there ever a wilder scheme than that respecting the public lands? 
</p><p>
The impression here is, that the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> Convention will 
make a nomination of me. I wish I could add that the impression was more favorable than it is of the success of such a nomination. Something, however, may turn up (and that must be 
our encouraging hope) to give a brighter aspect to our affairs. 
</p><p>
I shall be glad to receive the long letter promised in your last.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, With the compliments of the season, I acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 15th instant. Here 
we have nothing new. Opinions are in a progress of formation 
on the leading measures of the session. That of the Tariff will 
be the most difficult and agitating. I fear that there will be no 
agreement among parties, either as to the amount of the reduction of the revenue, or the objects on which it shall be effected. 
The ultras of South Cai'olina are very wrong-headed on the latter 
point. They appear to be bent on the destruction of the system 
of protection, or on their own destruction. 
</p><p>
The Executive is playing a deep game to avoid, at this session, 
the responsibility of any decision on the Bank question. It is 
not yet ascertained whether the bank, by forbearing to apply for 
a renewal of their Charter, will or will not conform to the wishes 
of the President. I think they will act very unwisely if they 
do not apply. 
</p><p>
You say the Calhoun party has almost disappeared at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. Judging from the number of the members of the General Assembly who attended the late caucus, I should suppose all 
parties but that of Jackson had disappeared in Virginia. I see "The Whig" has repeatedly admitted that the National Republican party is in the minority. I suppose it is so, but is it politic 
to make such an admission? Will such an admission secure additional strength, or any credit even for candor? Is it consistent 
with the purpose of making a struggle, if that be designed in 
Virginia?

My dear Sir, I have been so constantly occupied, that I 
have not been able to write you as much or as often as I wished. 
That terrible long speech of mine in the Senate, which gave me 
less trouble in its delivery than it has since occasioned me, is 
now in the hands of the printer, and being disposed of, leaves 
me at leisure to say a few words. 
</p><p>
Every thing is going on well. Yan Buren, old Hickory, and 
the whole crew, will, I think, in due time, be gotten rid of. 
The attempt to excite public sympathy in behalf of the little 
Magician has totally failed ; and I sincerely wish that he may 
be nominated as Vice-President. That is exactly the point to which I wish to see matters brought. Do urge our Jackson 
friends (if there be any that you can approach) to nominate him 
on the 28th. It will be so consistent that they should support 
him who is, or at least pretends to have been, for the Tariff, and 
oppose all others who are for it. 
</p><p>
We have had various affairs here, and of which the papers 
will give you some account. The most bitter of the opposition 
is the Calhoun element. I heard to-day that a South Carolina 
Governor is in correspondence with a Virginia Lieutenant-Governor. Will our friend Lloyd on that occasion call out the 
posse, as he was supposed by some here to have intended to 
prevent the removal of the remains of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>?

My DEAR Sir, I received your favor of the 15th. I am sorry 
that I can give you no satisfactory information as to the course 
of Georgia in respect to the recent decision of the Supreme Court. 
It is rumored that the President has repeatedly said that he will 
not enforce it, and that he even went so far as to express his 
hope, to a Georgia member of Congress, thai Georgia would support her rights.

The Committee of Investigation into the conduct of the Bank, 
leave here on Wednesday, for  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. The impression 
now is, that the Bank Charter will pass at this session. Mr. 
Adams, being appointed one of the Committee, took the occasion 
to ask to be excused from serving on the Committee of Manufactures, as its Chairman ; whereupon the head was immediately 
knocked out of a barrel of oil, and the whole quantity poured on 
him by Southern gentlemen, and other anti-Tarifiites. He was 
induced to postpone his motion. 
</p><p>
I have requested Messrs. Gales & Seaton to send fifty of my peeches to Mr. White.

My dear Sir, You will have seen the disposition made on 
Thursday last of my resolution respecting the Tariff. - On that 
occasion some developments were made of a scheme which I have 
long since suspected that certain portions of the South were disposed to purchase support to the anti-Tariff doctrines, by a total 
sacrifice of the public lands to States within which they are situated. 
 
A more stupendous, and more flagitious project was never conceived. It will fail in its object, but it ought to be denounced, 
A majority of the Senate (composed of all the anti-Tariff Senators, 
and some of the Jackson Tariff Senators), referred a resolution 
concerning the public lands to the Committee of Manufactures ! 
Can you conceive a more incongruous association of subjects? 
There were two objects. The first I have suggested ; the second 
was to affect me personally, by placing me in a situation in which 
I must report unfavorably to the Western and South- Western 
States, which are desirous of possessing themselves of the public 
lands. I think I shall disappoint the design, by presenting such 
views of that great interest as will be sanctioned by the nation. 
Meantime, I should be glad if you would give some hints to our 
friend Pleasants, and let him sound the tocsin. In Illinois there 
are about forty millions of acres of public land, and about one 
hundred and fifty or one hundred and sixty thousand people. 
What think you of giving that large amount of land to that comparatively small number of people? If it were nominally sold 
to them, it would, in the end, amount to a mere donation. 
</p><p>
We have nothing new about the course of Georgia, and the 
President's intention as to the decision of the Supreme Court. 
The current opinion is that he will not enforce it. 
</p><p>
We shall report in part, in a day or two, a bill limited to a 
repeal of duties on the unprotected class of foreign imports, reserving for future report the other class, as to which, however, 
I do not anticipate that any thing can be done to satisfy South 
Carolina.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 29th ultimo, communicating the tenor of a conversation with Governor Floyd. 
At the time that the Governor appeared as a witness before the 
public to testify against me, during the late Administration, I was 
surprised and hurt, and thought he took a course utterly inconsistent with the friendly relations which had previously existed 
between us, to say nothing of the opposite views which he and 
I took of the matter to which his testimony related. But, whatever feelings were excited in my mind at the time, they have 
</p><p>
been long since thrown aside, with a mass of analogous feelings 
awakened during an ardent and angry Presidential contest. My 
nature is such as to prompt me to forget these things, and I 
should be sorry if it were otherwise. 
</p><p>
The clew to the motives which induced Governor Floyd 
voluntarily to make that explanation, I have discovered here 
since I received your letter. A design exists, on the part of Mr. Calhoun and his friends, to have his name presented as a candidate, provided they conceive that he will stand any chance of 
getting three or four Southern States ; and provided, as the 
means of their accomplishing that object, our friends will cooperate in Virginia, and south of it, with his, to give him their 
votes. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> had, at his instance, a conversation with a 
friend of mine, which was general, and understood by that friend 
to be preliminary to another which Duff Green subsequently sought 
with him. In the course of this latter, Duff explained fully the 
views and wishes of the Calhoun party. These are, that his name 
shall, in the course of the ensuing summer (say August), be presented as a candidate ; that, if no ticket is run in Virginia by our 
friends, and if they will co-operate with his, he can obtain the vote 
of that State ; that, with a fair prospect of receiving the vote of 
Virginia, he will obtain those also of North Carolina, Georgia, 
and South Carolina, and probably of Alabama and Mississippi; 
that the result would be to defeat the re-election of General 
Jackson, and to devolve the election on the House ; that there 
they suppose I would be elected ; and that they would be satisfisd with my election. Such is the general outline of their 
project, the details of which were communicated by DiilT after 
the previous general conversation with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>. My friend 
presumed their intention was that he should communicate to me 
what passed, and he has accordingly communicated it. Duff 
stated that the success of the whole plan of the campaign, on 
their part, required that our friends should not present an electoral 
ticket ; and, moreover, should support them in Virginia. 
</p><p>
I have neither said nor done any thing in reply to all this, to 
commit my friends or myself. I. could not, without dishonor, 
have ventured upon any sort of commitment of them. They 
are, in fact, free, and so I wish them to remain, to act according 
to their own sense of propriety. 
</p><p>
As to the project itself, I have supposed that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> has 
too little capital any where, r>ut of South Carolina, to engraft upon : that it would be impracticable, if it were desirable, to induce our friends in Virginia to abandon all purpose of supporting a ticket on our side, and of co-operating in the support of 
one for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> ; that if such a concocted movement were 
made, it would be very probably defeated by the imputations 
which would be brought against it ; and that the whole idea has 
sprung out of the desperate condition of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>'s prospects. 
If there could be any movement at the South which would secure to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> the vote of three or four Southern States, 
{lext to their being given to our cause, it would, undoubtedly, 
be the best thing that could happen for us. It would every 
where else stimulate our friends to the greatest exertions, by 
holding oat the hope of certain success. It would break the 
power of Jacksonism, and discourage his friends in other States 
quite as much as it would animate ours. 
</p><p>
Let me, my dear friend, hear from you on this matter, and 
particularly your views as to the strength of the party of Mr. 
Calhoun in Virginia. Has it not relapsed into Jacksonism? 
Could it be brought forth again, in its original force, to the 
support of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>? Supposing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> is not put forward as a candidate, what course, generally, will his friends in 
Virginia pursue? Could our friends be prevailed upon to unite 
on a ticket for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>? Or, in the event of no ticket being 
put up for our cause, would they not divide between Jackson 
and Calhoun, the larger part probably going to Jackson? When 
do our friends contemplate bringing out the ticket which has 
been thought of for our side? 
</p><p>
How long will you remain at St. Julien? that is, when will 
you return to your official duties at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>? 
</p><p>
If I am to judge of what I see and hear, and know, there is 
a general persuasion in the public mind of the insecurity and 
danger in the existing state of the general Administration. 
That there is too much cause for that persuasion, I sincerely believe. The important inquiry is, what ought to be done what 
can be done? As to myself, I am ready to consent to any disposition that would rid the country from impending perils, if any 
disposal of myself could contribute to that most desirable result. 
You are upon the judgment bench, and, perhaps, may there see 
more calmly than we can who are in the contending arena, 
what the good of our common country, in the present crisis, 
really demands from her true and devoted sons, among whom, whatever to the contrary others may profess to think or say,
know none to be more sincerely and zealously attached, than 
your faithful friend.

My dear Sir, I have received your affectionate letter of the 
23d instant, and the interest which it manifests in my health and 
prosperity has affected me sensibly. Among the many circumstances to disgust me with life and my fellow man, the waraith, 
fidelity, and duration of your friendship have ever been a source 
of cheering satisfaction. You have described, I believe correctly, the true causes of my indisposition ; and your advice is full 
of wisdom. Naturally ardent, perhaps too ardent, I can not 
avoid being too much excited and provoked by the scenes of 
tergiversation, hypocrisy, degeneracy, and corruption which are 
daily exhibited. I would fly from them, and renounce forever 
public life, if I were not restrained by a sentiment of duty, 
and of attachment to my friends. I shall endeavor to profit by 
your kindness, and to avoid as much as possible, in future, all 
causes of irritation. I have quit the use of tobacco, in one of 
the two forms to which I had been accustomed, and will gradually discontinue the other. I will also endeavor to moderate the 
interest excited by public affairs. 
</p><p>
Since my return I have felt, with the exception of one day, better. I wish I could have remained longer with you. Should 
I not feel my strength and health returning, I will make another 
excursion to Maryland or  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
Nothing material has transpired here. Our friends are acquiring daily more confidence, and the Jackson party are greatly 
alarmed. It was remarked to me this morning that they have 
become panic struck. 
</p><p>
A report is anticipated from a bare majority of the Bank Committee, recommending further investigation to be prosecuted in 
the recess. There will probably be a counter report. 
</p><p>
Two reports may be expected from the Secretary of the 
Treasury, and the Committee of Manufactures, next week, on 
the Tariff, and presenting different plans of modification.

My DEAR Sir. I did not answer your last, because I had some 
hopes of seeing you here, and because I wished to be able to 
communicate to you something about the proceedings of the 
N. R. Convention at Harrisburg. The inclosed letter from Mr. 
Sergeant (which you can return after reading) will give you the 
latest information from that place. Other letters which I have 
received corroborate his views. The progress of the work of 
co-operation between the Anti-Masons and N. R.'^s in New York 
continues, and every day adds to our confidence that it will be 
secured, and that its result will be to deprive Jackson of the support of that State. It is an affair, however, of much delicacy 
and of no little difficulty, from the fanaticism of some, and the 
perverseness of others, of the Anti-Masons. The letter which you 
procured <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jab" rel="colleague met">Governor Barbour</a> to write to Rose has had good effect, 
and if he could repeat the anodyne it would not be amiss. Stevens (the Anti-Masonic candidate for Lieutenant-Governor in 
New York) was here a few days ago, and assured me that he 
v/as fully persuaded that we should succeed in New York. 
Lieutenant-Governor Pilcher (now a member of the House of 
Representatives from that State, and elected as a Jackson man) 
said to me, last evening, that he had no doubt of our success 
there. 
</p><p>
We are going on with the Bank in the Senate, and, I presume, will pass the bill on Monday or Tuesday. In the House 
of Representatives Mr. M'Duffie's Tariff bill had only about 
forty-four supporters. No time of adjournment yet spoken of. 
Mr. Hith, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, is here, and I am highly pleased 
with him.

My dear Sir, Pennsylvania continues daily to exhibit signs 
of the most cheering character, and there is just reason to hope 
that she is lost to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. 
</p><p>
A Tariff has passed the House of Representatives by a large 
majority. It will finally pass the Senate with or without modifications. It is a law which, with some alterations, will be a 
very good measure of protection. 
</p><p>
The Bank bill will, I think, pass the Senate in a few days ; 
and if Jackson is to be believed, he will veto it. 
</p><p>
Congress will adjourn on the 9th or 16th, most probably on 
the latter day. Afterward I believe I shall go to the White 
Sulphur Springs, but it may not be until the 1st of August that 
I shall reach there. I hope I shall find you there.

My DEAR Sir, ^We reached here safely on Thursday last 
and find a very great crowd. Two of your sons are here, and 
we saw the third at Staunton. They are all well. I feel much 
better already, and hope the water will completely eradicate the 
disease under which I was suffering at St Julien. 
</p><p>
I am informed, from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, that the President has resolved to suspend the execution of the parts of the law passed 
at the last session, relating to internal improvements, to which 
he" objects. What think you of this high-handed measure? 
What of his daring violation of the Constitution, in re-appointing 
Gwinn? Is proud Virginia ready to bend her neck to these usurpations? 
</p><p>
Speaking of your State, I do believe, with proper exertions, 
it might be carried against Jackson. The two parties exhibit, 
at this time, apathy and confidence on one side, and despondency 
on the other. If you would exchange for your despondency 
zeal and concert, I am half persuaded that you would triumph. 
Your strength is greater than you are aware of. The weakness 
of the other side is greater than is believed. Let our friends 
organize, throughout the State ; let each county be divided into 
sections, -and let one or more members of your Committees of 
Vigilance be designated in each to bring the voters to the polls, 
and I incline to think that you would win the day. All this 
should be put in motion by some central committee. What 
would serve to animate our friends, and to dispirit our opponents, 
is the high probability of success, whatever may happen to be 
the vote of Virginia. 
</p><p>
We shall remain here until the 15th. Be pleased to make the 
respects of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a> and myself to Mrs. Brooke and the young 
ladies, and believe me your affectionate friend.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, On my arrival here, a few days ago, I found 
your favor of the 28th ultimo. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a> did not accompany 
me, but remained at home, in consequence of the shortness of 
the session, and the apprehended bad state of the roads, both in 
coming and returning. 
</p><p>
It is useless to dwell on the issue of the Presidential election, 
respecting which we were so greatly disappointed. From whatever causes it proceeded, it is now irrevocable. 
</p><p>
You ask, what is to be done with nullification? I must refer 
you to the President's proclamation. One short week produced 
the message and the proclamation the former ultra on the side 
of State rights, the latter ultra on the side of consolidation. How 
they can be reconciled, I must leave to our Virginia friends. As 
to the proclamation, although there are good things in it, especially what relates to the Judiciary, there are some entirely too 
ultra for me, and which I can not stomach. A proclamation 
ought to have been issued weeks ago, but I think it should have 
been a very different paper from the present, which, I apprehend, 
will irritate instead of allaying any excited feeling. 
</p><p>
Congress has not yet been called upon, and I sincerely hope it 
may not be necessary to call upon it, in this unfortunate affair. 
How is the proclamation received at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>? 
</p><p>
I shall leave here to-morrow, to accompany my fourth son as 
far as  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, on his way to New England. And, in great 
haste, I add assurances of my constant and cordial esteem.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your two last favors, and should 
lave written to you before and oftener, but that I really have 
lad nothing interesting to communicate. As to politics, we 
lave no past, no future. After forty-four years of existence unler the present Constitution, what single principle is fixed? The 
Bank? No. Internal Improvements? No. The Tariff? No. 
Who is to interpret the Constitution? We are as much afloat 
It sea as the day when the Constitution went into operaion. There is nothing certain but that the will of Andrew 
rackson is to govern ; and that will fluctuates with the change 
)f every pen which gives expression to it. As to the Tariff", 
row pending before the House, whether it will pass or no in 
hat body depends upon his command. 
</p><p>
I have been thinking of some settlement of that question, but 
[ have not entirely matured any plan ; and if I had, I am not 
satisfied that it would be expedient to off'er it. Any plan that I 
night offer would be instantly opposed, because I offered it. 
Sometimes I have thought that, considering how I have been 
md still am treated by both parties (the Tariff and the AiitiPariff), I would leave them to fight it out as well as they can. 
rhe lingering hopes for my country prevail over these feelings 
Df a just resentment, and my judgment tells me, that disregarding them, I ought to the last to endeavor to do what I can to 
preserve its institutions and re-establish confidence and concord. 
[ shall act in conformity with this judgment, but I am far from 
being sanguine that I have the power to effect any thing. 
</p><p>
You will have seen the late Message. It is able and elaborate, 
freer from passion than the proclamation, but not more compatible with the doctrines which prevail at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, You mistake very much my feelings in supposing that the doubt which I sometimes entertained of making 
any effort to rescue the country from its present difficult situation, proceeded from any spirit similar to that which actuated 
Coriolanus. That doubt sprang from the facts, that there was 
an organized party ready to denounce any proposition that I 
would make, because I made it ; and that the other party (the 
Anti-Tariff party) contained many individuals, in whose view the 
great interests and even the peace of the country, were subordinate to the success of the dominant party to which they belong, 
and to the success of the designated successor of the present 
chief magistrate. It is mortifying inexpressibly disgusting 
to find that considerations affecting an election now four years 
distant, influence the fate of great questions of immediate interest more than all the reasons and arguments which intimately 
appertain to those questions. If, for example, the Tariff now 
before the House should be lost, its defeat will be owing to tv/o 
causes 1st, The apprehension of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>'s friends, that 
if it passes, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> will rise again as the successful vindicator of Southern rights ; and 2d, Its passage might prevent the 
President from exercising certain vengeful passions which he 
wishes to gratify in South Carolina. And if it passes, its passage may be attributed to the desire of those same friends of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> to secure Southern votes. Whether it will pass or 
not, and if it does, what will be its fate in the Senate, remains 
altogether uncertain. 
</p><p>
You ask me in your last letter if Tyler is not a nullifier? I 
understand him to be opposed both to nullification and the proceedings of South Carolina. Will he be re-elected? We feel 
here some solicitude on that point, being convinced, that under 
all circumstances, he would be far preferable to any person that 
could be sent. I hope, if you can say a proper word in his behalf, you will do so.

My dear Sir, I had forborne to communicate to you the plan of accommodation which I intended to submit, because, 
although I had long since settled in my mind the principle of the plan, I had not finally arranged the details. That work was 
only completed a few days ago. You will see in the papers 
that I have presented it to the Senate in the shape of a bill. I was fully aware of all the personal consequences, and personal 
risks to which I exposed myself; but ''what is a public man worth that will not sacrifice himself, if necessary, for the good 
of his country ?" The measure has been well secured. Still every contrivance will be resorted to by the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Van Buren</a> men, 
and by some of the Administration party, to prostrate or defeat the project. That, you know, I anticipated. What will be the 
final issue of the plan, I can not certainly say. I hope for success. We had a meeting this morning of the Committee with 
the constitution of which I am satisfied and things look as well there as I expected. Webster, and some other of the New 
England Senators, will oppose the plan.

My dear Friend, The compromise of the Tariff proposed 
by me is likely to be adopted with great eclat. It has passed the House, and will pass the Senate by a large majority. It will be 
popular everywhere, even in the East. The Eastern vote in the House has been given against it, rather from policy than from 
any dislike of the measure. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a> and I came in conflict, and I have the satisfaction to tell you that he gained nothing. 
My friends flatter me with my having completely triumphed. There is no permanent breach between us. I think he begins already to repent his course. 
</p><p>
As to the publication of my letter, do as you please ; but I think it hardly merits it. 
</p><p>
I shall go to the North, or directly to the West, immediately after the close of the session. I regret that I can not have the 
pleasure of seeing you. Make my best respects to Mrs. Brooke.

Wheeling, for Kentucky. I have been detained by the Court. 
I regret that I could not have seen you. 
</p><p>
You ask how amity was restored between Mr. Randolph and 
me? There was no explanation, no intervention. Observing 
him in the Senate one night, feeble, and looking as if he was not 
long for this world, and being myself engaged in a work of 
peace, with corresponding feelings, I shook hands with him. 
The salutation was cordial on both sides. I afterward left a card 
at his lodgings, where, I understand, he has been confined by 
sickness. 
</p><p>
I heard to-day that Livingston is to go to France, Barry to 
Spain, and Stevenson to England ; and that M'Lane will be 
made Secretary of State, Woodbury of the Treasury, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsythe</a> 
of the Navy, and Colonel Wilham Wilkins Post-master General. 
Caring nothing about these arrangements, I vouch for nothing. 
</p><p>
You may like to know that there is no breach between Webster and me. We had some friendly passes, and there the matter ended. Since, we have occasionally met on friendly terms. 
I think (of course I do not know) that if he had to go over 
again the work of the last few weeks, he would have been for 
the compromise, which commands the approbation of a great 
majority.

My dear Sir, You observe that your letter of the 13th 
found me here. I had, prior to its receipt, sent you a copy of my 
speech which is to be published by Gales & Seaton in the order 
of the debates. They have not published one word of the commendation of the bill, which has been put forth by other editors. 
To preserve an attitude of impartiality they, in eftect, make 
themselves partisans of those who oppose the measure. Do you 
think it necessary that I should revise the speech which I made 
on the introduction of the bill? That which was published for 
me was done without my seeing it. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry that Sergeant and Binney disapprove the measure, but I can not help it. I communicated it to them confidentially before I brought it forward, and they opposed no remonstrance. As for Walsh, he has but one god, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a> is

I have been detained here by the most violent cold I ever had ;

My dear Sir, I duly received your favor. I should have 
written to you before, but in this remote quarter we have rarely 
any thing interesting to communicate. Since my return from 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, I have been principally occupied with the operations of my farm, which have more and more interest for me. 
</p><p>
There is a great difference, I tliink, between a farm employed 
in raising dead produce for market, and one which is applied, as 
mine is, to the rearing of all kinds of live stock. I have the 
Maltese ass, the Arabian horse, the merino and Saxe merino 
sheep, the English Hereford and Durham cattle, the goaj;, the 
mule, and the hog. The progress of these animals from their 
infancy to matm'ity, presents a constantly-Varying subject of 
interest, and I never go out of my house, without meeting with 
some of them to engage agreeably my attention. Then, our 
fine green sward, our natural parks, our beautiful undulating 
country, every where exhibiting combinations of grass and trees, 
or luxuriant crops, all conspire to render home delightful. Notwithstanding, I shall leave it early in July, to make a journey 
which I have long desired to perform. I shall go through Ohio 
to Lake Erie, thence to Buffalo, Niagara, Montreal, Quebec,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saratoga" rel="city">Saratoga</a>, and toward September, to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, where I have a young 
son of sixteen. The papers have attributed to me an intention 
of visiting New England, as if it were the principal object of 
my excursion. It is the least important one, and I should not 
go there but for the sake of my son. I intend traveling with 
as much privacy as practicable, and absolutely to decline every 
species of public entertainment. I wished to have been accompanied by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a>, and my son, and son-in-law, with their 
respective wives ; but neither of the young ladies are in a traveling condition, and my <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="spouse met">wife</a> hesitates about going without either 
of them. 
</p><p>
You perceive that the journey I have sketched will not admit of my having the pleasure of meeting you at the White 
Sulphur Springs. I visit no place in the summer with more 
gratification than that finest of all, our mineral springs ; but I 
have never seen the Falls of Niagara, and unless I avail myself 
of this summer to go there, I shall probably never have another 
opportunity. 
</p><p>
I have not decided whether I shall return to the Senate or 
not. If the Land bill had passed, I certainly should not have 
gone there again ; and the condition in which that measure has 
been left, creates the only doubt which I feel. But have 
I not done all that was incumbent on me? Twice have I 
pressed the bill in the Senate, where it has twice passed, and 
once in the House. I regret most deeply that the South, 
hitherto, has opposed that measure. They will regret it some day, if it fails ; for the public lands will be lost to the country, 
■without some such measure is adopted. They will be used as 
an instrument to advance the ambitious views of some Presidential aspirant, by offering motives to the new States to support 
him. Already they are attempted to be applied to that object ; 
for how otherwise can you account for the opposition of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>'s friends, in New York, to the Land bill, and thus separating themselves from the rest of the North, and evidently arraying themselves against the interest of their own State? 
</p><p>
You tell me that Messrs. Leigh, etc., speak of me as a candidate for the next Presidency, and even think of having my name 
forthwith announced. I am greatly obliged, by their favorable 
opinion ; but I really feel no disposition to enter again on an arduous and doubtful struggle for any office. I have seen no evidence of any favorable changes in respect to me, that are of an 
extent sufficient to justify the opinion, that a result of a new 
contest v,/'ould take place different from former experiments. 
Nothing is so abhorrent to my feelings as to be placed in a position in which I should appear as a teasing suppliant for office. 
That of President is full of care and vexation. One borne to it 
by the willing suffrages of a large majority of his countrymen, 
may get along well enough in it ; but if it is to be obtained in 
a hard contest, by a bare majority, or by a decision of the House 
of Representatives, between several candidates, no one having 
a majority, it has no charms, at least none for me. I doubt very 
much whether any successful opposition can be made against 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>'s designated successor. The press, patronage, 
and party, will probably carry him triumphantly through. I have 
borne the taunts of the Jackson party and principles long enough. 
The country has not thought proper to sustain my exertions. 
Distinguished men, who could not possibly have viewed things 
differently from me, have stood by with a cold indifference, 
without lending any helping hand. What can one man do 
alone against a host? 
</p><p>
If I am asked what I think of the present state of things, 
and of the future, upon the supposition of success on the part of 
the candidate referred to? I answer, Bad enough, bad enough, 
God knows. But what can I do? Have I heretofore ever 
ceased to warn the country against it? Worn out and exhausted 
in the service, why should I continue to sound the alarm, with 
no prospect of my being more heeded hereafter than heretofore? 
 
I want repose. I have reached a time of life when all men want it. I shall not neglect the duties which belong to one 
who has aimed to be a good citizen, and a patriot, even in retirement ; but the country had better try other sentinels, not more 
devoted or zealous, but who may be more successful than I have been. 
</p><p>
Such, my dear sir, is the true state of my feelings. Your 
partiality and friendly wishes about me, may not your unbiased judgment must approve them. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a> unites with me in warm regards to Mrs. Brooke. For yourself, I need not repeat the assurance of my cordial esteem and friendship.

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, August 2,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1833">1833</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received your favor of the 20th ultimo, 
and take great pleasure in transmitting an account of the remedy 
most successfully applied in the treatment of the cholera in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. I send you herewith a number of the "Western Journal," which contains an article bringing into review almost all 
that has been written on the subject of the scourge. The description and treatment of the disease by Mr. J. Kennedy (the 
first work reviewed) resemble most the appearance of it here, 
and accord best with the most approved practice. 
</p><p>
From all that I saw and heard about it here, I have drawn 
the conclusions : 
</p><p>
1. That certain reliance can be placed upon no remedy after 
the disease has reached the state of collapse and cramps. 
</p><p>
2. That, prior to that state, no sure reliance can be placed on 
any treatment which does not embrace the use of calomel in 
moderate doses. 
</p><p>
3. That if the disease commences, as it generally does, by a 
complaint in the bowels, calomel in doses of from five to twentyfive grains, taken every hour, or two, until the discharge from 
the bowels is checked, may be relied upon with a high degree 
of certainty. 
</p><p>
If there be considerable discharge from the bowels, opium, 
in the proportion of one grain to every two of calomel, or fifteen 
or twenty grains of laudanum, were advantageously given with 
calomel. 
</p><p>
The use of emetics and bleeding was much controverted. I 
believe them both good, in certain cases, and they were both 
occasionally resorted to with benefit, though I think neither indispensable. In the early stages of the disease only, and when 
it has not assumed what Mr. Kennedy calls the rapid type, would 
it be advisable to employ the emetic? Ipecac, salt, and mustard, 
and warm salt and water, were all used. We had among our 
slaves a number of cases of violent pain in the abdomen, which 
we feared might terminate in cholera. In most of them we 
administered salt and mustard in equal proportions, about a tablespoonful of each forming a dose, which was, however, repeated 
until vomiting ensued, and, after the operation, twenty grains of 
calomel, combined with twenty grains of rhubarb. All of them 
were relieved. The same remedy, with the same success, was 
employed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jae" rel="kin met">Mr. Erwin</a>'s, and at a bagging factory in the city. 
</p><p>
The attack made upon MR.Dudley's practice was in consequence of his use of the emetic ; and, I think, was unfounded. 
</p><p>
Some of our physicians employed enormous doses of calomel, 
but I believe with no advantage. 
</p><p>
I send you a letter I received from Dr. M'Nairy, containing 
an account of his practice, which, as I understand, was very successful. 
</p><p>
Most sincerely do I hope that you may not have occasion for 
any application whatever to this terrible disease. It still rages 
with great violence in some parts of om- State. 
</p><p>
You seem to think that I despond as to our public affairs. If 
you mean that I have less confidence than I formerly entertained 
in the virtue and intelligence of the people, and in the stability 
of our institutions, I regret to be obliged to own it. Are we not 
governed now, and have we not been for some time past, pretty 
much by the will of one man? And do not large masses of the 
people, perhaps a majority, seem disposed to follow him wherever he leads, through all his inconsistencies? He does not, it 
is true, always govern positively, by enforcing the measures 
which he prefers ; but he prevents those, although adopted by 
the representatives of the people, to which he is opposed ; and 
although manifestly for their good, they acquiesce in and applaud 
whatever he does, and take sides with him against the legislative 
authority. If that single man were an enlightened philosopher, 
and a true patriot, the popular sanction which is given to all his 
acts, however inconsistent or extravagant, might find some justification. But when we consider that he is ignorant, passionate, 
hypocritical, corrupt, and easily swayed by the base men who surround him, what can we think of the popular approbation which he receives? 
</p><p>
One thing only was wanted to complete the public degradation, and that was, that he should name his successor. This he 
has done, and there is much reason to believe that the people 
will ratify the nomination. Although that successor may be 
now, in some places, unpopular, when we reflect that the whole 
patronage of the Government will be directed for three years to 
insure his success ; and that a system of organization exists, in 
the largest State of the Union, wielding about one seventh of the 
whole electoral vote, the probability of his final success must be 
admitted to be great. To these chances we have to add others. 
In the South, it is now pretty evident that you are about to reenact the scenes of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a>"><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a></a>, when, under a romantic notion of adhering to your candidate, you threw away your votes upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, a paralytic, although it was perfectly notorious that he 
stood no earthly chance of being elected. Now, under the erroneous idea that other parts of the Union contemplate an attack 
upon your slave property, and with the purpose of adhering to 
what are called your principles, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, or somebody else, 
will be brought out, and a great effort will be made to rally the 
South in his support. The contest will be between him and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>. The latter, aided by the dominant party in 
Virginia, may secure that State. But it will so turn out that, 
whatever votes the Southern candidate may get, will serve <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> almost as effectually as if given directly for himself; 
because they will be so many abstracted from some other formidable competitor. Thus, by the operation of the instruments 
now in full employment to secure his election, and by the divisions of those opposed to him, he will obtain the majority, or 
enter the House of Representatives with a resistless popularity. 
</p><p>
His election once secured, the corrupt means of preserving and 
perpetuating power, now in successful operation at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, will 
be transferred to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. And there we shall have a state 
of things which will prepare the public mind for a dissolution 
of the Union, to which, unfortunately, there is less aversion now 
than could be wished by those who love their country. 
</p><p>
I hope I maybe deceived in these predictions ; but I fear that 
I will not. Believing in them, you can not be surprised that, at 
the age of fifty-six, and after the struggles which I have made 
to maintain the public liberty, and to avoid the evils which now 
menace us struggles, I repeat, in which I have been too little 
sustained I should think seriously of a final retirement from the 
theater of public life. 
</p><p>
My daughter was happy to find herself in your friendly recollection, and desires me to assure you of her cordially reciprocating your esteem. She is very happy, possessed of the 
affections of her husband, residing upon a beautiful place adjoining mine, and enjoying affluence and every blessing.

Senate Chamber, December 11,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1833">1833</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I have delayed acknowledging the receipt of 
your favor, in consequence of an uncertainty whether my answer should be addressed you at St. Julie n or at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and 
I am yet at a loss which direction to give it. 
</p><p>
My journey was full of gratification. In spite of my constant protestations that it was undertaken with objects of a private nature exclusively, and my uniformly declining public 
dinners, the people every where, and at most places, without 
discrimination of parties, took possession of me, and gave enthusiastic demonstrations of respect, attachment and confidence. 
In looking back on the scenes through which I passed, they 
seem to me to have resembled those of enchantment more than 
of real life. 
</p><p>
From indications which have been as yet given, it would 
seem that the session opens with a majority in the House for the 
Administration, and a majority in the Senate against it. We 
passed a pretty strong measure yesterday, resuming the appointment of committees by the Senate itself. On that vote, parties 
stand twenty-two to eighteen. We hope to reverse the majority 
in the House, and to strengthen it in the Senate, if we have no 
desertions. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I addressed a letter to you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, but 
understand that you are at St. Julien, to which I direct this letter. 
</p><p>
We were highly gratified to-day in the Senate. We carried 
the appointment of every chairman of the committees as we 
wished : and as far as we proceeded, every member of the several 
committees, with one unimportant exception. There is a fair 
prospect of our having in the Senate a majority of twenty-six 
or twenty-seven. 
</p><p>
Whether it will be practicable to rescue the Government and 
public liberty from the impending dangers, which Jacksonism 
has created, depends, in my opinion, mainly upon the South ; 
and the course of the South will be guided mainly by Virginia. 
Hence the very great importance of this State taking a patriotic 
direction. I understand that you are thought of for the Chief 
Magistrate. I know the sacrifices you must make, if you except that station ; but can not you make them? " What is a 
public man worth who is not ready to sacrifice himself for his 
country?" Depend upon it, that every thing for which you 
fought, or which you and I hold valuable, in public concerns, is 
in imminent hazard. By means of the Veto, the power as exercised of removing from office, the possession of the public 
treasures, and the public patronage, the living existence of liberty and the Government is, in my judgment, in peril. 
</p><p>
I mean myself to open and push a vigorous campaign. It is 
tha campaign of 1777. I want aid all the aid that can be 
given. I mean which will surprise you to be very prudent, 
but very resolute. Can you not assist us?

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 12th. That 
written by you early in December never came to hand, and I 
regret it. As to the repeal of the Force bill, there are parts of 
it which are permanent, and which, in my judgment, ought to 
remain, independent of and distinct from any excitement in 
South Carolina. The two sections (the first and fifth) contain 
some provisions, to which I objected on their passage. If the 
repeal of them were asked, not on the ground of the truth of 
the principles of nullification, but as expedient, since the necessity for them has passed by, to tranquillize the South, it might 
not be objectionable, although, even in that view, those parts of 
the act expiring with the present session, by express limitation, 
there is no great utility in the repeal. But it is not asked on 
any other ground than that nullification is right, and to that I 
can not assent. If I could forget myself and my principles so 
much as to adopt those of nullification, it would prove my utter 
ruin as a public man. Nullification is every where in the minority but in South Carolina. In Kentucky, it can not hold up 
its head. And I think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> has been unfortunate in 
stirring this matter, which had better be left to sleep quietly. 
</p><p>
What is doing in your Legislature about the deposits? We 
want all aid here on that subject which can be given us from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. What has been done there has been of immense 
service to us. Virginia is herself again, and has once more the 
power to rally around Tier standard the friends of freedom. Bui 
bold, determined conduct on her part is necessary ; and particularly on the subject of the public treasury. If she now falters 
or falls back, it would have been better that she should have 
never excited any hopes ; for then we might have all sunk 
quietly into the abyss of despotism.

My dear Sir, I should have written you oftener, but for the 
best reason in the world, that I had really nothing to write that 
was interesting. 
</p><p>
The debate on the deposits continues. We are gaining both 
in public opinion and in number in the House of Representatives. 
We are probably still there in a minority, although the majority 
is not large, and will melt away if the current of public opinion 
continues to mix with us. 
</p><p>
I transmit you a letter in answer to one I received. I wish

My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 6th inst., as I 
did that about the Compiler, with the subscription money which 
Mr. R. declined. 
</p><p>
I should write you oftener, but that I have really nothing of 
interest to communicate. Almost daily, too, I express in the 
Senate what I have to say on public affairs. 
</p><p>
The view taken by the writer in " The Whig," as to the effect of either House not concurring in the sufficiency of the 
reasons of the Secretary of the Treasury, had not escaped me. 
It would be conclusive, if the act of removing the public deposits was conditional, but it is a perfect and performed act, 
before the reasons are communicated to Congress. I have always believed that if both houses concurred in pronouncing the 
insufficiency of those reasons, it would, without any further or 
other legislative action, become the duty of the Secretary to 
restore them, and I have wished to be able to think that such 
would be his duty, if either House disagreed with him. Bat if 
one House agree, and the other disagree, is not the result a state 
of neutrality? 
</p><p>
We shall look to the issue of your approaching election with 
very great anxiety.

We are very thankful for the kind invitation contained in

My DEAR Sir, I received your favor, transmitting a copy of 
the address of the minority of your Legislature. It did not 
strike me as possessing much ability, but on some points was 
very weak and vulnerable. I am not aware that any answer to it from this place will be attempted. 
</p><p>
I received also your subsequent favor. 
</p><p>
Things remain in status quo here. There is a small, but as 
yet inflexible majority, sustaining the Executive in the House. 
If the elections in Virginia and New York, should be adverse to 
the Administration, that majority probably will be changed, but 
in an opposite event, it may be increased, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> yesterday offered to bet me a suit of clothes upon each of the elections in the city of New York and in your State. The Administration party is very confident, and our friends are not without 
fears as to the issue of matters with you. It is with politics 
as with the currency. In certain states of both, a slight circumstance produces much effect. We were not prepared here for 
the unfortunate result in Bouldin district. It depressed our side, 
and elevated the other, far beyond what such an event would 
have done at any other time. 
</p><p>
What are your real prospects? I should confide much in 
your judgment. Would you like to take up Van's bet? 
</p><p>
I told him yesterday, that if the people entertained the Administration in its late measures, I should begin to fear that oui 
experiment of free Government had failed ; that he would 
probably be elected the successor of Jackson ; that he would introduce a system of intrigue and corruption, that would enable 
him to designate his successor ; and that, after a few years of 
lingering and fretful existence, we should end in dissolution 
of the Union, or in despotism. He laughed, and remarked that 
I entertained morbid feelings. I replied, with good nature, that 
what I had said, I deliberately and sincerely believed.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, I received your favor this evening of the 9th 
instant, returning ^15 collected of me at Cincinnati, for your paper published at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbus" rel="city">Columbus</a>. I own to you that there was something in the time and circumstances under which the demand 
was made that gave me momentary mortification. I believed 
then that it was without your instructions or sanction, and your 
letter confirms my belief. Had the application been made to 
me at home, and not in the presence of strangers ; had it not 
been made as if I were a person of doubtful integrity, it would 
not have excited any feeling. Your friendly letter has perfectly 
relieved me. It has preserved you on the ground of honor and 
delicacy where I had always been accustomed to regard you. 
The only regret I now feel is that you did not retain the sum, 
while you made the explanation. Although your paper was 
sent to me, as stated by you, and as many others have been forwarded, I ought to pay the subscription, having received the 
value. And you must allow me to consider myself indebted to 
you the amount, to be paid at some time when I shall have the 
pleasure of seeing you, which I hope and sincerely desire may 
be soon. 
</p><p>
I shall be glad at all times to hear from you on public affairs, 
or any other topic. I saw a good deal of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">General Harrison</a> at 
Cincinnati. Very little passed between us on the subject of the 
Presidency. He was very respectful and cordial. He appeared 
to be in good spirits, and I thought seemed confident. I adhere 
to the opinion expressed in my former letter, that, if Pennsylvania •will give satisfactory demonstrations of an intention to support him, it will be expedient, under all circumstances, to run 
him as the most available candidate against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>. The 
issue of the Rhode Island election following that of Connecticut, 
proves, I fear, that it is in vain to look even to New England for 
the support of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a>.

My DEAR Wife, I got to Governor Metcalfe's, last night, in 
good time, and reached here to-day, at two o'clock. The 
weather has been very fine, and my ride was a very good one. 
They tell me that a steamboat will be here this evening, in 
which, when it arrives, I shall embark. I have directed Aaron 
to go to Governor Metcalfe's to-morrow night, and the next day 
home. 
</p><p>
I feel very uneasy about our dear daughter, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abc" rel="child met">Anne</a>, I sincerely 
hope that she may get well, and that all my apprehensions may 
prove groundless. 
</p><p>
I feel too, my dear wife, most sincerely and excessively alive 
respecting your lonely situation. I regret it extremely, and 
whatever you may think to the contrary, I should have preferred, 
greatly, your accompanying me. But I hope and believe that 
this is the last separation, upon earth, that will take place, for 
any length of time, between us. And I hope that you will make 
every effort in your power to be cheerful, contented, and happy.

Dear Sir, I received your favor of the 26th ultimo. My

to Morrison Boswell, agreeably to the will of Colonel Morrison ; 
but all the papers of the estate being at home, I can certainly 
affirm nothing and do nothing until my return.

We learn from Kentucky that Morehead has declined, leaving

My dear Sir, ^I am glad to learn by your favor of 15th inst. 
that Mrs. Brooke's health is improving, and sincerely hope that it 
may soon be entirely re-established. 
</p><p>
Your objection to an immediate organization of an Opposition, 
upon the principles stated by me, apphes rather to the time of 
its commencement than the principles themselves. Undoubtedly, 
such an Opposition should avail itself of the errors of the new 
Administration ; but it seems to me that it would acquire greater 
force by availing itself also of that fatal error in its origin, which 
resulted from the President-elect being the designated successor 
of the present incumbent. If a President may name his successor, 
and bring the whole machinery of the Government, including its 
one hundred thousand dependents, into the canvass ; and if by such 
means he achieves a victory, such a fatal precedent as this must 
be reb'uked and reversed, or there is an end of the freedom of 
election. No one doubts that this has been done. And no reflecting man can doubt that, having been once done, it will be 
again attempted, and unless corrected by the people, it will become, in time, the established practice of the country. Now, I 
think that no wisdom or benefit, in the measures of the new 
Administration, can compensate or atone for this vice in its origin. 
Still this point may be pressed or not, according to circumstances, 
in different States. As for Virginia, I am afraid another generation must arise before she regains her former high rank. Henceforward, at least during our lives, I apprehend, she will be only 
a satelite of New York. 
</p><p>
I am obliged greatly to Mr. Pleasants for cherishing his friendly 
sentiments toward me, and request you to assure him that they 
are cordially reciprocated. Nothing of interest has occurred here 
since the burning of the General Post-office. I understand that 
the opinion is general among the inhabitants of the city that it 
was not accidental.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 8th, as I did the 
preceding one to which it refers, and which I postponed answering until I had something worth communicating. There is indeed some highly interesting occurrence here almost daily, but 
the papers generally notice it. You will have seen the letter of 
the President to the Committee of Investigation. Yesterday, a 
still more extraordinary one was presented to the Senate by Mr. 
Calhoun, in which the President, in the harshest and most offensive language animadverts upon a speech made by that Senator 
in the Senate. The majority was reminded that they alone possessed the power to vindicate the privileges of the Senate against 
the Executive encroachments. But they all remained mute ; 
not one venturing to offer any motion. Such is the degradation to which Congress is reduced ! 
</p><p>
You congratulate me on my acceptance of the new appointment recently conferred on me to the Senate. I think you 
ought to have condoled and sympathized with me, because, by 
the force of circumstances, I was constrained to remain in a body, 
in the humiliated condition in which the Senate now is. I shall escape from it as soon as I decently can, with the same pleasure 
that one would fly from a charnel-house. 
</p><p>

can I do, what mischief avert, by remaining?

the Cumberland route oflers advantages so superior to any other, 
that I must follow it to Kentucky. Would to God it were for

regards, and believe me always and cordially your friend.

My dear Sir, I received your favor. This day the ex-President left this city, and the President, for the first time, sent in a 
batch of nominations. Poinsett for the War Department ; Dallas 
for Russia; Heywood, of North Carolina, for Belgium, etc. The 
three mentioned were confirmed. Smith, of Alabama, and Catron, of Tennessee, were nominated by Jackson for judges of 
the Supreme Court, under the new law. And what judges they 
will make ! They are not yet confirmed. Labranche, of Louisiana, was also nominated by Jackson, for Texas, and has been 
confirmed as Charge d'Affaires. 
</p><p>
You ask if I can communicate any consolation to you for the 
future, as to public affairs. I lament to say not much. Hopes 
are entertained, and with some probability, that there will be a 
majority in the House of Representatives at the next session, 
against the Administration ; and if there were more concert, and 
a union as to the ultimate object, among the Opposition, there 
would be better prospects. I think there is a tendency to union 
among them, but it is not yet produced. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, now, as 
heretofore, stands in the way. 
</p><p>
The city has been filled with strangers. The crowd from New York has been as great as it was from Scotland, when James ascended the throne in England.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, May 26,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1837">1837</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, Just as I was making preparations for my 
trip to St. Louis, and had resolved to start in a few days, the 
proclamation of the President arrived, calling Congress on the 
first of September. T shall be obhged to leave home, to reach 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> in time, about the middle of August. Consequently 
I have only two months and a half to attend to my private affaire. If I were to go to St. Louis, and examine my lands in 
Missouri, as I wished, it would absorb one half of that time, and 
not leave me enough to attend to necessary matters here. I am 
compelled, therefore, to abandon my contemplated journey for 
the present. I assure you, my dear son, that I do it with great 
regret ; for I wanted much to see you, and to see your place and 
the improvements you have made upon it. 
</p><p>
As I can not go to see you, you must come and see me. You will yourself judge of the most convenient time for you to leave home, and come here. By the first of July, I suppose your crop will be laid by, and the season of your Jack will be over ; and if you can not come before then, you will be able to leave home at that time. 
</p><p>
I wish you to say to Major Graham, how much I regret not being able to see him at his residence, as I expected and intended, I am sorry for it also on account of his suit, in which I wished to have rendered him any service in my power. But it 
is probable that, if his suit shall be heard at the time he expected, he may be able to engage the services of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a>, who 
left here on yesterday on his way to Louisville, and thence to St. Louis, which place he will reach, I suppose, about the 6th 
of June. His wife and his daughter accompany him, and when they get there T wish you to call and see them. 
</p><p>
We have had a very dry spring, insomuch that I have never seen the grass so low. But two days ago the rain began, and 
we have had the most copious showers. Should the remainder of the season prove good, we shall be able, I trust, to make good crops. 
</p><p>
Henry's two mares from England have arrived, and both had colts, but he had the misfortune to lose one of them. He had 
also imported six cows ; two died on the passage, the other four arrived with four calves. I have given him nine hundred dollars for one of the cows and her calf. 
</p><p>
Should you want money to bring you home, you must inform me, or if there be not time to inform me, draw upon me. 
</p><p>
The family are all well, and join with me in love to you.

[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">MR. CLAY</a>] TO A COMMITTEE OF GENTLEMEN IN NEW YORK. 
</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, August 6,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1837">1837</a>. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen, I duly received the letter which you did me the 
honor to address to me on the 20th ultimo, transmitting a copy 
of the proceedings adopted at preliminary meetings of a number 
of my friends in the city of New York, in relation to the next 
Presidential election. 
</p><p>
On the question of the propriety of agitating the public at 
this time by a discussion of that subject, I entirely concur in the 
opinion expressed by you, that it would be altogether premature. 
Six months have not yet elapsed since the termination of the last 
election, and more than three years and a half remain of the 
term which was then filled. The country is, moreover, suifer
ing under a great calamity. Its currency and its business lie 
prostrate. All minds are absorbed by considerations relative to 
measures of immediate relief. At such a moment to disturb or 
distract the public attention, by introducing another exciting but 
remote topic, seems to me to be unwise. In expressing this sentiment, it is far from my purpose, to convey any reproach or censure toward those who have taken a different view of the matter. It is quite likely they have supposed, and may be right in 
supposing, that the only adequate remedy which can be found 
for the evils with which the country is now afflicted, will be a 
change of those rulers by whose agency they have been produced or continued. But the necessity of some earlier relief is 
so great, and the expediency of bringing to the consideration of 
it a spirit of moderation, forbearance, and conciliation, is so obvious, that I think we should first direct our exertions exclusively 
to this single object. We shall soon ascertain how far the Administration will co-operate with the country in the restoration 
of a sound state of things. 
</p><p>
To guard against misconception, I ought to add that too much 
delay as well as too much precipitation should be alike avoided, 
in arrangements connected with the next election of a Chief 
Magistrate of the Union. Precipitation would expose the disinterestedness of our patriotism to unjust animadversion; protracted delay, to the danger of division and defeat. 
</p><p>
I also agree with you, gentlemen, entirely in thinking, in regard to a candidate for the Presidency, that some mode should 
be adopted of collecting the general sense of those who believe 
it important to the preservation of our liberties involved, the correction of abuses, and a thorough reform in the Executive Administration, that there should be a change in the Chief Magistracy. And none better appears to me to have been suggested 
than that of a Northern Convention. This will not supersede 
the previous employment of all proper means to produce union, 
harmony and concentration. A resort to such means is recommended by their tendency to prevent those unpleasant collisions, in the choice of delegates to the Convention, which might 
leave, among the friends of the respective candidates, a state of 
feeling, unfavorable to that hearty co-operation in the final struggle 
which is so essential to success. 
</p><p>
Having said this much upon the general subject, allow me 
now to add a few words in relation to myself personally. You are pleased to honor me with your attachment and confidence, 
to appreciate highly my public services, and to desire to place 
me in the highest station of the Government. I am profoundly 
grateful to yon, and to all those friends who cherish toward me 
similar sentiments. I think, however, that the question of the 
particular individual who should be selected to accomplish those 
patriotic purposes which we have in view, although not unimportant, is of subordinate consequence. It should not be allowed 
to become the paramount object, nor to divide more, than is absolutely unavoidable, those who agree in the general principle. 
</p><p>
I have not, for several years, looked to the event of my being placed in the chair of Chief Magistrate, as one that was 
probable. My feelings and intentions have taken a different 
direction. While I am not insensible to the exalte4 honor of 
filling the highest office within the gift of this great people, I 
have desired retirement from the cares of public life\; and although I have not been able fully to gratify this wish, I am in 
the enjoyment of comparative repose, and looking anxiously 
forward to more. I should be extremely unwilling, without 
very strong reasons, to be thrown into the turmoil of a Presidential canvass. Above all, I am most desirous not to seem, as I 
in truth am not, importunate for any public office whatev^er. If 
I were persuaded that a majority of my fellow-citizens desired 
to place me in their highest executive office, that sense of duty 
b^'' which I have been ever guided would exact obedience to 
their will. Candor obliges me, however, to say that I have not 
seen sufficient evidence that they entertain such a desire. 
</p><p>
Entertaining these feelings and sentiments, I think it best for 
the present to adhere to the passive position which I have prescribed to myself. Should a National Convention of our friends 
nominate any other person, he shall have my hearty wishes for 
success and my cordial support. And, before the assembling of 
such a Convention, if one should be agreed upon, there may be 
such indications of the public will as will enable us all clearly 
to trace the line of our duty toward our common country. 
</p><p>
Requesting, gentlemen, you and all who attended the meetings, the proceedings of which you have had the goodness to 
forward to me, to accept my grateful acknowledgments, I am 
your friend and obedient servant.

Dear Sir, From numerous communications and circumstances, I think it probable that, whatever may be my own inclination or disposition, I shall be again forced into the Presidential

the information which has reached me. 
</p><p>
In the city of New York, notwithstanding, and subsequent to 
the movement there for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a>, my friends spontaneously 
resolved to organize. From all the Wards a committee of one 
hundred was formed, subdivided into other Committees of Correspondence, Finance, etc., and they tell me that they have 
ascertained that a decided majority of the Whigs prefer me in 
that city. The Committee has addressed me, and I have replied. 
Perhaps my reply may be published. I take the ground of entire passiveness ; that I do not wish my name used, unless there 
is reason to believe it is wanted by a majority of the country, etc.

white face (an old Hereford that was put up last winter to be 
killed) fattened for beef for the family, and any other of the old 
cows that he may think it well enough to kill. There is a 
little two year old at Mansfield (I believe she is an estray heifer 
with a black nose) that might as well be slaughtered for early 
beef.

Wheeling, October 19,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1837">1837</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, I have reached this place on my return home 
from Congress, a good deal jaded and not very well. Prior to my 
departure from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, I received your letter communicating 
the death of poor Russell, which gave me sincere concern. ] 
have been quite uneasy about you, but hope that you have escaped sickness. You ought to be very careful with yourself, 
for your Missouri fevers are very dangerous. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to hear of the great loss you have sustained in 
sheep ; and I am now convinced more than ever that it is unwise for you to keep them, unless you have a number sufficiently large to pay the expense of a shepherd to keep constantly 
with them. Under these circumstances, I think you had bettei 
fatten what remain and sell them for mutton. 
</p><p>
I expect to remain at home until late in November, and then 
proceed again to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, although I am very tired of so 
frequently crossing the mountains. I wish you to write me often 
and let me know all that concerns you. I send this by the boat 
that carries me to Maysville.

</p><p>
My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, I reached home on the 22d instant, and received your letter of the 17th. I found all well here, but it is 
said to be very sickly at Louisville and at Frankfort, and we 
have been uneasy about you. I hope that you will escape being sick, I wrote you by the journey from Wheeling, and sent my 
letter by the steamboat. I advised you in that letter to sell your 
sheep, seeing that they are not safe from the dogs and wolves. 
Unless you had a number sufficiently large to justify keeping 
a herdsman, it is useless to keep sheep. 
</p><p>
You tell me that land is still rising in Missouri. I wish you 
could sell, at a fair price, my small tract in Lincoln, and also the 
Alton tract, if you could get a good price for it. What could 
you sell your land for? But I suppose that nothing could induce 
you to sell it and return ro Kentucky. Mr. Smith tells me that 
Chaumiere, the residence of the late Colonel Meade, is in market 
at $40 per acre, which is very low as land has sold here. It is 
very good land, having, I understand, about four hundred acres 
in the tract. That would not be large enough without the purchase of some addition to it, which probably might be made. 
But if you are contented with your situation and prospects, you 
had better not think of purchasing it. 
</p><p>
We will try and have your cattle, etc., sent to you, as you desire. I am afraid that the river may be too low, although it is 
now raining. Thomas seems quite happy since his marriage.

</p><p>
My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, I was glad to find by your letter of the 29th 
ultimo, just received, that you were in good health and spirits, and 
your business prosperous. I started Orphan Boy, your cow, dog, 
and gun, on the 7th instant, for St. Louis via. Louisville and steamboat, under th^ care of William Nelson White, a young man 
raised in this county, and recommended to me. He lost two 
days in the start by accident, as he says, and I sent Aaron to 
look after him and the cattle. Aaron has returned this evening 
and reports that he saw the man with the cattle safely across the 
bridge at Frankfort and going on well. So that I hope no 
further mishap will occm*. I send you a copy of the receipt 
which Mr. White gave me, from which you will perceive that 
I advanced him |20, was to pay all expenses of himself and the 
cattle, and to allow him half a dollar per day as a compensation. 
The two days that he lost ought to be deducted from his account 
Although he started with the dog, he could not carry but left him. 
 
I have written to Mr. Wm. Prather to advance the money for 
his freight, etc. He had charge of another calf which he was 
to leave between here and Louisville. 
</p><p>
I will make arrangements in a few days to advance you the ^100 which you desire. 
</p><p>
I wrote yon, on my way home, and again after my return, and advised the sale of the sheep. 
</p><p>
I have been engaged all this week in getting in my corn. My hogs are sufficiently fat to kill when it is cold enough. Yesterday my new overseer, Mr. Florea, came and entered on business to-day. 
</p><p>
Your mother had made up her mind to go with me to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, but has finally declined it.

My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, I received, to-day, your favor of the 6th 
instant, but have not received your previous letter, to which you 
refer, in which you made an offer of the Alton land to Mr. Tegert. I had, however, before I left home, submitted the matter 
of the sale of that land to you, and I shall be content with whatever you may do, being sure that your intentions will be to do 
the best for us all. 
</p><p>
With respect, too, to your project of having wood cut from it 
for the supply of the consumption of St. Louis, I leave that affair to your judgment. If it be well attended to, I have no 
doubt that it may be rendered profitable ; but recollect that it 
will depend altogether upon the degree of attention paid to it. 
It will have the effect of repressing trespasses upon the land. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to hear of the loss of your heifers, but we must 
expect occasional losses, and increase our diligence to repair 
them. 
</p><p>
Your resolution to study, and to begin with history, is a good 
one, and I hope you will persevere in it.

My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 17th. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison's</a> Journal is not yet ordered to be printed, and, without any 
such object in the delay, it may lead to the benefit of Mrs. Madison, by allowing the sale and diffusion of the European edition 
of the work. When printed by Congress, I will recollect your 
wish to obtain a copy. 
</p><p>
Ritchie has discovered a mare's nest in the fact that the 
Whigs are making arrangements to establish a new paper here. 
They do not propose to establish it by resorting to the public 
crib, from which his and other papers are maintained, but by 
voluntary contributions, raised among an abused and betrayed 
people. There is no occasion to conceal the object. The 
Whigs mean to beat the Administration party, and the public 
press will be one of their instruments. The design is to establish a new paper to espouse and advance the cause generally, 
without reference, at present, to any particular candidate. 
</p><p>
The committee charged with the business have under consideration the selection of suitable editors, etc. I mentioned, several days ago, to one of the committee, Mr. Blackford as one 
whose qualifications deserved attention. They will be, doubtless, duly weighed ; but it will be best not to excite expectations, 
or to stimulate any direct application from him. I think very 
highly of his principles, and his ability. I have no doubt, however, that whatever decision may be finally made will be the 
result of the best intentions.

My best respects to Mrs. Brooke, and my hearty congratulations on your recent acquisition of a daughter.

My dear Son, I received your letter of the 23d ultimo. 
You complain of not hearing from me. I have written to you 
several times since I have been here, and would have written 
oftener, if I had had any thing to communicate. But my correspondence is very oppressive, and I find it impossible to keep 
up with it. You must not suppose that I feel any want of affection toward you. Far otherwise. You are constantly in 
my thoughts, and in my hopes. I feel that you must be very 
lonesome, and regret to hear that you are not happy. You know, 
my dear son, that I feared you would not be, separated as you 
are from all who love you, and that I reluctantly consented to 
your going to Missouri. I hope that you will endeavor to cultivate feelings of contentment, and I shall be most happy, on 
my return home, if we can make any arrangement by which 
you can come back to Kentucky, and live in the midst of your 
friends. 
</p><p>
The account you give me of your affairs is encouraging, and 
the account of you which I receive from others also gives me 
high satisfaction. What I would especially guard you against, 
is, every species of dissipation ; and I own to you that I have 
feared yom' solitary condition might tempt you into it. But I 
sincerely hope that may not prove to be the case. 
</p><p>
I suppose your offer of the Alton land was declined. It is 
very important to protect it against trespasses, and I trust you 
will take care of that. In a former letter, I gave my assent to 
your having wood cut for the St. Louis market.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, The arrear which I am under in our correspondence, has proceeded from my really having nothing of interest to communicate, and I need not tell you that my correspondence and public engagements are so oppressive, that I am constrained to avoid writing whenever I can. Even now I should 
not address you, but from my apprehension that you would 
misconstrue my silence. 
</p><p>
We have been engaged in the Senate, during the last eight 
or ten da^^s, in the most unprofitable discussion that ever engrossed 
the attention of a deliberate body. It was upon five or six as 
abstract resolutions as a metaphysical mind can well devise. 
They are at last disposed of. Their professed object is slavery ; 
their real aim to advance the political interest of the mover, and 
to affect mine. I am greatly deceived if in both respects he 
has not signally failed. He was caught in his own trap. You 
will see the series of counter-resolutions which I ofiered. The 
two most important, after undergoing some modifications, with 
my assent, were adopted as substitutes for his. His Texas resolution was laid on the table yesterday, by a vote of thirty-five to 
nine. I think that when that subject comes up, I will turn the 
tables upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, as much as I did on the affair of 
slavery. 
</p><p>
There is not, I think, the slightest ground of approaching war 
with Great Britain, on account of Canada. When the President's Message was received, respecting the capture and destruction of the " Caroline," I thought it due to the occasion to reprehend in the strongest terms, the violation of our jurisdiction. 
My remarks are correctly published in " The National Intelligencer," and there only. " The Globe" habitually misreports me. 
</p><p>
Resolutions have been introduced in the Kentucky Legislature, recommending me as the next President. Although I presumed that something would be done at Frankfort, I anticipated 
nothing in this form, and I think it displays more zeal than 
discretion.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received your letter of the 12th instant, 
and feel grateful for the friendly solicitude concerning my 
health which it evinces. We have indeed had a terrible time 
of it at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, and in other parts of Kentucky, with the 
cholera. The accounts which have reached you are probably 
not much exaggerated. But I have reason to be thankful for 
the signal exemption from loss with which we have been blessed. 
In a family of about sixty, white and black, we have had no death ; and the connections, both of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a> and myself, have 
been generally equally fortunate. My daughter, Mrs. Ervin, my 
nearest neighbor, has escaped the scourge with her entire family. 
And a letter from my brother, received this day, informs me that 
in his family, near Frankfort, consisting of about twenty-four, 
there has not been a single death, nor even a case of premonitory 
symptoms, while they were dying all around him, as they were 
near me. 
</p><p>
It was after the pestilence had broken out that I received the 
distressing intelligence of the untimely fate of our friend Johnston. It filled me with grief. Greatly as I felt and deplored 
the loss of those around me, his struck deeper, and gave me a 
more incurable wound. The public has reason to regret being 
deprived of one of the most useful, patriotic, and honorable 
servants. 
</p><p>
The apprehension that the cholera might visit my family in 
my absence, determined me to abandon my northern journey, 
from which I had anticipated so much satisfaction. I regret it 
extremely ; but you will readily conceive how painful my situation would have been if, when distant from my residence, I had 
heard that it was here. 
</p><p>
I am greatly obliged by the kind attentions of yourself and 
other friends to my little son. I am sometimes afraid that he 
may be spoiled by the civilities which are showered upon him. 
</p><p>
I pray you to communicate my respectful compliments to Mrs. 
Everett.

My dear Son, I received your favor of the 1st inst. I have 
been a little unwell, and have been so much oppressed with business, correspondence, and company, that I have been obliged 
to engage a your friend to act for me as amanuensis, and he 
wrote the letter to which you refer upon my dictation. 
</p><p>
I return the inclosed certificate with my signature. I am 
perfectly satisfied with the disposition you have made of your 
cattle with Mr. Dorrey. I am sorry that the imported cow does 
not breed, and I must give you another after awhile. We will 
talk about the house which you wish to build, when I see you. 
But I still should be happy to have you back in Kentucky, if we 
can make some arrangement, as I hope we can, to that end. I 
have not yet procured the patent, but I hope to get it for your 
land to be issued in the name of Doctor Rogers. I have been 
looking out for a wife for you, but I suppose you will have to 
select for yourself.

My dear Sir, I should have written you more frequently

this session, from obvious causes. 
</p><p>
In regard to the Presidential question, every thing is going 
on as well as my most zealous friends could desire. Public 
opinion every where, even in Indiana and Ohio, is rapidly concentrating as you could wish. The movement at Harrisburg 
for a separate nomination of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">General Harrison</a>, is rebuked and 
discountenanced.

My dear Sir, I am extremely sorry to hear of the loss of 
your servant. It is a serious misfortune, and not easily repaired, 
independent of the distress which such an event must necessarily 
occasion to every feeling heart. 
</p><p>
I can not understand from any inquiry which I have made 
here the exact value of your Military Land Warrant. Mr. Allen, 
the Senator, from Ohio, thinks it worth seventy- five cents per acre; 
but recommends an application to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wic" rel="colleague met">William Creighton, Jr.</a> (who 
is a man of honor and a particular friend of mine), of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chillicothe" rel="city">Chillicothe</a>, 
who resides in the heart of the county set apart for the army. 
</p><p>
If the bill making further appropriations for land scrip, now 
pending in the House of Representatives should pass, your warrant will be worth much more, perhaps $1 20 cents per acre. 
Although I can not vote for the bill, I think it very probable it 
will pass at this or another session, and you would probably do 
well not to part with it. 
</p><p>
I should be most happy to see you here, and why can't you 
come? A few hours would put you in the Pennsylvania Avenue. 
If you visit us, come directly to Mrs. Hill's boarding-house, where 
I stay, and where you can be accommodated. It is nigh Gadsby's.

Every thing has passed off admirably at the Ohio Convention.

My dear Sir, I received your favor from the White Sulphur 
Springs, and was gratified to learn that the President had been 
so attentive to you. He is always courteous and civil in his 
manners. 
</p><p>
Mr. Rives' determination not to be a candidate for the Senate 
is wise. Should he adhere to it, some embarrassment will be 
avoided at your next Legislature. 
</p><p>
The elections of Kentucky and Indiana have eventuated 
successfully to the Whigs, without any diminution of their 
strength. I believe we have carried the election in Illinois, but 
It IS not yet certainly ascertained. The Locofocos have carried 
that in Missouri, but by a greatly diminished majority.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, I received your favor of the 27th ultimo, but I can hardly say that I had very great pleasure from its perusal ; 
for, upon my word, if you will excuse me for saying so, the paper and the writing are so bad that I do not know that I have guessed its contents. 
</p><p>
As to the movement in the State of Massachusetts you will 
have seen that it is alleged to have been without authority, and 
is retracted. If we succeed in the elections of Pennsylvania 
and New York, I attach no importance to that, or any similar 
movement, whether with or without authority. My impression 
is that the editor of " The Atlas" expressed sentiments which he 
supposed would be acceptable to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a>. 
</p><p>
Your suggestion as to a Bank of the United States would do 
well, if it would conciliate support from those who are opposed 
to such an institution ; but my impression is that it is to the 
thing, in any form, more than to a particular modification, that 
opposition exists. At present, however, it is useless to try to establish any Bank of the United States with any modification 
whatever. It should not be attempted until the people clearly 
call for it. This I think they will do ; but if they do not, if 
they are opposed to it, I, for one, cheerfully acquiesce in the decision. 
</p><p>
We have been, and yet are, terribly afflicted with drought. It 
has injuriously affected our crops, but I presume not as much as 
yours have been. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, November 3,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1838">1838</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 18th ultimo, and, 
as it informed me of your intention to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, I address this letter to that city. You think I have too good an 
opinion of mankind. I confess that I have, throughout life, 
striven to think well of them, but the last thirteen years have 
shaken my faith very much. I yet, however, believe the mass 
to be honest, although very liable to deception. 
</p><p>
You are certainly right as to one of the two gentlemen mentioned, perhaps as to both, being unwilling to see me elected 
Chief Magistrate. I was greatly surprised at the course of 
" The Atlas ; " and although <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a> disavows its authority 
to speak for him, in that particular, there are intelligent persons 
</p><p>
near him who believe that 'The Atlas' presumed upon his concurrence. The issue of the elections, this fell, so far, have been 
very unfavorable to the Whig cause. From September of last 
year to September of this, the current ran deep and strong in 
our favor, and swept over every State, changing majorities 
against us, or, at least, diminishing them. All at once, and 
without any apparent cause, the current reverses its direction. 
What has produced it? To give you a proof that I am not too 
confiding, I can not forbear expressing my suspicion that a profuse and corrupt use has been made of the public money. It is 
almost impossible otherwise to account satisfactorily for what 
we have witnessed. Amos Kendall was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbus" rel="city">Columbus</a> the week 
before the election. How easy was it for him to give orders 
throughout the State, from that central point of Ohio, to carry 
the election at any cost. And how can he be brought to account, if he has given such orders? 
</p><p>
Other circumstances will enable us to account for some of 
the results of these elections. In Ohio, the Abolitionists are alleged to have gone against us, almost to a man. Senator Morris, you know, is one of them, and that, put together with the 
unfortunate case of the Methodist preacher, delivered up by 
Governor Vance upon the demand of the Governor of Kentucky, 
turned them against us. Perhaps they were previously inclined 
toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>. 
</p><p>
If New York goes against us, as is to be apprehended after 
what has occurred, our cause will look bad. You will know 
the event by the time this letter reaches you. It is to be apprehended, because, whether changes have been produced in other 
States by voluntary impulse of the people, or by corrupt means, 
the same cause, whatever it may be, is likely to exert itself in 
New York. ^ 
</p><p>
The introduction of this new element of Abolition into our 
elections can not fail to excite, with all reflecting men, the deepest solicitude. It is, I believe, the first time it has been done. 
Although their numbers are not very great, they are sufficiently 
numerous, in several States, to turn the scale. I have now before me a letter from the Secretary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, in New York, in which he says : " I should consider 
(as in all candor I acknowledge I would) the election of any 
slaveholder to the Presidency a great calamity to the country." 
</p><p>
The danger is that the contagion may spread until it reaches all the free States ; and if it ever comes to be acted on as a rule 
among them, to proscribe slaveholders, they have the numbers 
to enforce it. Union and concert with them will throw the 
whole Government into their hands, and when they have once 
possession, the principle by which they have acquired it will urge 
them on to other and further encroachments. They will begin 
by prohibiting the slave trade, as it is called, among the slave 
States, and by abolishing it in the District of Columbia, and the 
end will be 
</p><p>
My own position, touching slavery, at the present time, is 
singular enough. The Abolitionists are denomicing me as a 
slaveholder, and slaveholders as an Abolitionist, while they both 
unite on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>. 
</p><p>
I should be extremely happy to visit <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> and see yon 
and the many other friends I have there, but I can not do it 
while I remain a quasi candidate for the Presidency. A candidate in fact I can not say, and have not said to any human being 
I would be. I am strongly inclined to promulgate that I will not 
be, under any circumstances. How would it do? The principal objection which I perceive, is, that they would say that I 
saw the grapes were sour. But then, what need I care for any 
thing they may say? 
</p><p>
Pray remember me affectionately to Leigh. I rejoice to be 
able to infer, from a recent letter of his, addressed to another 
person and sent for my perusal, that his health was fully re-established. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a> unites with me in regards to Mrs. B.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I presume that this letter will find you quiet 
at St. Julien. I should have written you before had I any thing 
interesting to communicate. To-day, on a call for information 
as to the relation between the Bank of the United States and the 
Treasury Department, Mr. Rives came out in a speech of remarkable vigor and decision, which showed conclusively that he 
had cut loose forever from the Administration. Of that I previously entertained no doubt, and now I think the public can 
entertain none. On the subject of his re-election to the Senate, 
it would be highly improper for me to interfere, and I do not 
mean to interfere ,- but I may to you say that those with whom 
I have conversed out of Virginia, think that it would be attended 
with very good effect. 
</p><p>
In consequence of the Anti-Masonic and other movements, 
since the last session of Congress, at the commencement of this 
my friends were a little discouraged. They are recovering 
from it, think that things look much better, and entertain confidence that public opinion, in regard to the next Presidency, will 
remain unchanged, as it was at the last session. 
</p><p>
My own opinion is that, with a view to arrest the unfortunate 
divisions which exist among us, to check the progress of intrigues, and to secure concentration, action at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, by the 
Whig portion of the Legislature (including, if possible, the Conservatives) is highly expedient. Such a movement would probably be followed and seconded at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> ; and in that case, I 
think the question would be settled, and our future difficulties 
would afterward constantly decrease. In this opinion the most 
intelligent of our party, with whom I have conversed, fully concur. 
</p><p>
It is highly important, if any thing is done, that the Conservatives should unite at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, or if they can not be prevailed 
upon to do so, that there should be as little division as possible 
among the Whigs. The Northern Conservatives, mchiding Mr; 
Talniadge, remain firm and decided. And my information from 
New York generally is full of encouragement. The mock 
nomination of the Anti-Masons has fallen still-born, and has produced no material effect even in the Anti-Masonic portion of the 
Slate. It appears that in the pretended Convention, there was 
not a delegate elected by a primary meeting whatever of the 
An ti- Masons ; that except the Delegates from Pennsylvania 
(who were nominated at some previous Convention), not a member held his seat in virtue of any election whatever ; and that 
some member from New York assumed the power to cast the 
whole vote of that State ! 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my best respects to Mrs. Brooke.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, December 26,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1838">1838</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your two favors of the 24th. What I 
may say on the subject of Mr. Rives' re-election must be regarded 
as expressed at your instance, and as presenting opinions which prevail exterior to Virginia, without any intention on my part to 
interfere in a local election in a State in which I am no resident. 
</p><p>
Those out of your State are struck by the fact that a co-operation between the Whigs and Conservatives will secure a majority 
against the Administration ; and that without it the majority may be the other way. 
</p><p>
The object, therefore, to be accomplished, if it be practicable, 
is to secure that majority co-operation ; and to those at a distance Mr. Rives' re-election appears to be a probable means. 
If it be not ; if a hearty co-operation can not be produced by it ; 
if nothing is to be gained but Mr. Rives himself, quite a different view of the question would be entertained. Mr. Rives has 
himself no claim upon the Whigs but those which arise from his 
recent course ; and confining the question to him alone, his expunging vote and former course would more than neutralize his 
recent claims. But a more extended view should be taken of 
the matter. If he can be used as an instrument to acquire an 
accession of strength that would array Virginia against the Administration, the inquiry then would be, whether sound policy 
does not demand that we should sacrifice all feelings excited by 
a highly cKceptionable vote, in consideration of a great object to 
be gained for the good of our country. I appreciate and feel 
sensibly all the difficulties in making such a sacrifice, but I think 
that I could submit to it, if I had a reasonable certainty of that 
object being secured. 
</p><p>
It is manifest that, if we repel the advances of all the former 
members of the Jackson party to unite with us, under whatever 
name they may adopt, we must remain in a perpetual and hopeless minority. 
</p><p>
Should we not extend to the repentant in politics the same 
forgiveness which the Christian religion promises to the contrite, 
even in the eleventh hour? The difference between Mr. Rives 
and some others now incorporated in our party, is, that their watches did not run together. 
</p><p>
Already has some mischief been done in Ohio, and in other 
places, by a refusal of all conciliation of the Conservatives. It 
was obvious that their position was temporary, and could not be 
maintained for any length of time. It was at a half-way house. 
They must therefore fall back into the ranks of their old associates, or be absorbed by us. And it seems to be a prevailing 
opinion here to be expedient to avail the country of the services 
</p><p>
of as many of them as we can get, either as allies or as a part of 
our consolidated force. I should add that it is feared, if he be 
not re-elected, the event will operate badly out of, as well as in Virginia. 
</p><p>
This is the view which is taken by those out of "Virginia. Its 
basis is the bringing about a co-operation in that State between 
the Whigs and Conservatives by his re-election. If that can not 
be effected (and of that those on the spot are the best judges), 
why, then, there will be another state of the question. 
</p><p>
I transmit this hasty letter for your own eye only. I know 
how justly sensitive to all foreign intervention the people of Virginia are, and I should not have touched on this delicate topic 
but upon your invitation.

My dear Sir, I received your favors of 29th ultimo and 5th 
instant. I regret extremely the existence of so much division of 
opinion in Virginia, respecting the election of a Senator, and 
sincerely hope that our friends may all become reconciled, and 
that what they may finally do may conduce to the success of 
our cause and the interest of our country. I have no individual 
wishes separate from the common good. What is best to be 
done at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> those alone can determine who there have a 
OTew of all circumstances. It is not, however, to be disguised, 
that what may be done will exercise an influence beyond the 
confines of the State. 
</p><p>
I have been struggling to-day, and some previous days, on the 
land subject. My friends are highly gratified with my exertions, 
and I hope and believe they have had some effect. Whether it 
will be practicable much longer to save that great interest depends upon the future course of the old States. I can not much 
longer defeat the combined action of the Administration and the 
new States. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, of our State, being on a visit of business at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, I have given him a letter of introduction to you. He

My dear Sir, I received your two favors of the 16th and 
17th inst. I am highly gratified with the prospects which exists 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, of general concurrence among the Opposition, as 
to the Presidential election, whatever divisions may unhappily 
exist on another question. It is of very great importance that 
there should be some expression of the preference which is entertained in Virginia, and its influence elsewhere would be great, 
if not decisive. 
</p><p>
I lament exceedingly, the unfortunate divisions which prevail, 
in respect to the Senatorial elections. Is it possible that there 
is any danger of the election of a friend of the Administration? 
Is it possible that any Whig can prefer such a friend to a Conservative? 
</p><p>
By the by, Mr. Rives, in conversation with me, expressed surprise at your opposition to his re-election. He derived different 
impressions from his intercourse with you at the White Sulphur 
Springs. His surprise was not accompanied with any complaint, 
but on the contrary, with declarations of high regard, and personal esteem for you.

My dear Sir, I have received your several favors respecting 
the state of things at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, in reference to your Senatorial 
election, and thank you for them. I did not acknowledge them, 
severally as they arrived, because they did not seem to call for 
any particular observation from me. The divisions and dissensions in the Legislature at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, are deeply to be deplored, 
and I fervently hope that means may be found to heal and 
harmonize. At Annapolis, they have just elected, or re-elected, 
Mr. Merrick, and concord, it is thought, will be again restored. 
</p><p>
The spirits of my friends are again revived, and they think 
that they see, in various quarters, indications of the final result 
which their partiality prompts them to desire. I believe myself, 
that the current in my favor, which for the moment appeared to 
be impeded, will again burst forward, with accumulated strength. 
</p><p>
The movement which you suppose will take place at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
if made, would give great impulse to that current. 
</p><p>
Poor Mrs. Wickham, I see, is gone. Those who are falling

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received your favor of the 13th ult., 
and felt highly gratified with the favorable account of the state 
of public affairs in Virginia, which it communicates. I must, 
however, retort upon you a charge that is often made against me, 
that I fear you are too sanguine. There seems to be making a 
prodigious effort on the side of the Administration, and I see no 
evidence of corresponding or counteracting exertions on the 
other side. Their late Convention will strengthen them, because it is an organization of their party, and the members will 
return to their respective homes, animated by the confidence 
and hopes inspired by their interchange of opinion and feeling. 
Where parties are nearly balanced, that which is disciplined, and 
in a state of complete organization, is almost sure to prevail over 
its adversary in the contest. I never was more perfectly convinced than I was in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1832">1832</a>, of the immense importance of a Convention, followed by a county and state organization. In the 
autumn of that year, just before the Presidential election, the 
young men held a Convention in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. It was well attended filled with the tlite of the State. They made many 
Stirring and eloquent speeches, published an address to the State, 
put it into complete organization, by the appointment in all the 
counties of large Committees of Vigilance and Correspondence, 
and returned home full of enthusiasm. The result was, Jackson 
was beaten by upward of seven thousand votes. If you could 
get a similar convention of young men at Charlottesville, or 
Staunton, just before the election, I believe that it would be attended with a similar result. 
</p><p>
By the by, is it possible that two of the judges of the Court 
of Appeals, attended and took part in the proceedings of the recent 
Convention, and that Judge Tucker presided? If it be true, I 
regard the fact as a strong mark of the degeneracy of the times. 
</p><p>
I have not enjoyed good health since my return home, from 
severe colds, but I am getting better, and we have the prospect of an 
early and fine spring. I found <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a> in her usual good health. 
</p><p>
Is it possible that there will be no arrangement between Messrs. 
Harvie and Botts ; and that they will both persevere, with the 
certainty of both being defeated? In such a state of things, 
the merit is with the declining party, whatever it may be. 
</p><p>
In Kentucky, every thing looks fair. We may carry every 
Congressional district, and we may be defeated in three. I think 
not more. From Tennessee, too, from Mississippi and Louisiana, I receive the most favorable accounts. 
</p><p>
Do me the favor to present the warm regards of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a>

I understand it to be conceded, by the Delegates and Members of Congress from New York, a majority of whom have 
waited on the General, that eight or nine tenths of the Whigs 
of that State prefer me. Nevertheless they prefer to make a 
nomination in conformity to the wishes of the one or two 
tenths. 
</p><p>
Now the question is, and it may be worked by the rule of 
three, whether it is easier to bring over eight or nine tenths to 
one or two tenths, or one or two tenths to eight or nine? whether the majority (and such a majority !) can be easier drawn to 
the minority, or the minority, small as it is, to the majority? 
</p><p>
What security is there that if a nomination is made, contrary 
to the wishes of a large majority, there is not danger of a loss, 
out of that maj ority, greater in extent than the one or two tenths 
who are only to be conciliated? 
</p><p>
But I will not pm'sue this matter. The considerations must 
all be obvious to you.

</p><p>
Gentlemen, I have received your letter inviting me to deliver an address at a celebration of the raising of the seige of 
Fort Meiggs, proposed the 11th of June,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1840">1840</a>. Considering the 
highly respectable source whence the proposal of this celebration originated, the motive of it, and the friendly terms in 
which you have conveyed the invitation, it would afford me 
much satisfaction to be able to accept it ; but, if my public duties do not, at that time, require ray attendance here, I shall have 
just reached my home, after an absence of six months. I can 
not, therefore, contract the engagement which you invite me to 
make, and must leave to some other person the gratification of 
addressing our fellow-citizens on the occasion in contemplation.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I arrived here safely the day before yesterday. 
Prior to my departure from home, I received your favor addressed 
to me there, as I now have that of the 6th, addressed to me 
here. I deeply regretted the loss of the Virginia vote, but presumed it was the result of fraud, and other causes. We are looking with great interest to the course of your Legislature. The 
want of a quorum in the Senate has prevented the reception of 
the President's Message. We shall get it to-day or to-morrow. 
</p><p>
I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">General Harrison</a> at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, and I have seen and 
conversed a good deal with him. He is much broken, but his 
mind retains all its strength and vigor. He appears to be animated by the best dispositions, and if he acts in conformity to 
them, om- hopes will be all realized. I communicated to him 
that, during the short time I expected to remain in public life, I 
had no desire to change my position in the Senate. He professed, and I have no doubt now entertains, sentiments of warm 
regard and attachment to me. I do not believe that he had then 
made up his mind as to the members of his Cabinet. I think it 
probable, although he did not say so, that he will invite <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjc" rel="colleague met">Crittenden</a> and Ewing to take places in it. Beyond that I will not 
venture even a conjecture. I thought it right to explain frankly 
to him my feelings and relations toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a>, and I 
stated to him that, although my confidence in that gentleman 
had been somewhat shaken, during the last eight years, I did 
not see how any Whig President could overlook him ; that if I 
had been elected, I should have felt myself constrained to offer 
him some distinguished station; and that if he chose to appoint 
him to office, it would not diminish the interest I felt in the 
success of his Administration, nor my zeal in its support, if it 
were conducted in the principles I hoped it would be. I added 
an expression of my opinion that he was not suited to the office 
of Secretary of the Treasury, which I had understood some of 
his friends wished him to fill. 
</p><p>
The General is to be here in a few weeks, to go to Virginia, and to return about the 4th of March.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 5th. I should 
have written to you before but I really had nothing to write. I 
am sorry that mere rumors about the composition of the Cabinet 
should fill any Virginia Whig with apprehension of the Spring 
elections. I venture to say that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">Gen. Harrison</a> will have a better 
Cabinet, and less of federalism in it than even Jackson or Van 
Buren had. What more is wanted? Are not some of our 
friends too nervous? <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a>, I suppose, will be a member 
of it ; but among all the rest talked of I know of no Federalist. 
"The Enquirer" calls <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crittenden</a> most untruly a Federalist. 
</p><p>
So it does me. But I hope that Virginia will no longer be affected by the slang of "The Enquirer." 
</p><p>
The exact time is not known when <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">General Harrison</a> will be 
here. It is conjectured that it will be from the 15th to the 25th 
instant.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your two last favors. During the 
twelve last years I have recommended no person for any place 
whatever, to the appointing power of the Federal Government. 
AH that I could do, therefore, to promote your wishes as to Dr. 
Berkly, was to urge Mr. Roane to exert himself, which I believe 
he has done most faithfully ; but I am sorry to be obliged to 
inform you that it has been unavailingly. He this moment informed me that the appointment has been given to a Mr. Brooks. 
</p><p>
I have been constrained, after a full consideration, and on a 
deliberate survey of the whole ground, to adopt the principle of 
non-interference with the new Administration, as to official appointments. Without it, if the day had a duration of fortyeight hours instead of twenty-four, I should be unable to attend 
to the applications I receive. 
</p><p>
We have nothing new here which the papers do not communicate. There has been a little, not much, diversity of opinion 
as to an extra session ; but opinions are settling down as to its 
necessity. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">General Harrison</a> probably will get to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> to-night.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, You complain of my arrearage in our mutual 
correspondence, and with, at least, apparent cause ; but I have 
never passed a winter of so much pressure as the one which 
has just terminated, if indeed it can be said to have terminated. 
The painful alternative was presented to me of a neglect of my private correspondence, or of my public duties, I could not hesitate 
which branch of it to adopt. I have not been able to transmit an 
answer to one out of every hundred letters that I have received. 
</p><p>
Moreover, I have had but little of interest to communicate of 
which the papers did not inform you. 
</p><p>
The new Senate has opened with a decided, practical, and 
available majority of twenty-nine to twenty-two, there being 
one vacancy from Tennessee. That majority, I think, may be relied on in almost all of the measures of the new Administration. 
</p><p>
The Senate will adjourn on Monday. The appointments 
made are, almost exclusively, to fill existing vacancies. General Payton has received that of Post-master at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. 
</p><p>
I pray you to present my affectionate regards to Mrs. Brooke.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, March 15,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1841">1841</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, Your incessant engagements preclude the 
probability of my having any opportunity of a private conversation with you, prior to my departure from this city. I therefore 
adopt this mode of saying a few words before I go. 
</p><p>
I was mortified by the suggestion you made to me on Saturday, that I had been represented as dictating to you, or to the 
new Administration mortified, because it is unfounded in fact, 
and because there is danger of the fears, that I intimated to you 
at Frankfort, of my enemies poisoning your mind toward me. 
, In what, in truth, can they allege a dictation, or even interference, on my part? In the formation of your Cabinet? You 
can contradict them. In the administration of the public patronage? The whole Cabinet as well as yourself can say that. 
I have recommended nobody for any office. I have sought none for myself, or my friends. I desire none. A thousand times 
have my feelings been wounded, by communicating to those who have applied to me, that I am obliged to abstain inflexibly from all interference in official appointments. 
</p><p>
I learned to-day, with infinite surprise, that I had been represented as saying that Mr. Curtis should not be appointed Collector of New York. It is utterly unfounded. I never uttered such expressions in relation to that or any other office, of the 
humblest grade, within your gift. I have never gone beyond expressing the opinion that he is faithless and perfidious, and, in 
my judgment, unworthy of the place. It is one of the artifices by which he expects to succeed. 
</p><p>
If to express freely my opinion, as a citizen and as a Senator, 
in regard to public matters, be dictation, then I have dictated, 
and not otherwise. There is but one alternative which I could 
embrace, to prevent the exercise of this common right of freedom of opinion, and that is retirement to private life. That I 
am most desirous of, and if I do not promptly indulge the feeling, it is because I entertain the hope perhaps vain hope that 
by remaining a little longer in the Senate, I may possibly render 
some service to a country to whose interests my life has been 
dedicated. 
</p><p>
I do not wish to trouble you with answering this note. I 
could not reconcile it to my feelings to abstain from writing it. 
Your heart, in which I have the greatest confidence, will justly 
appreciate the motives of, whatever others may say or insinuate, 
your true and faithful friend.

fully re-established, nor do I expect it until warm weather, if 
that should ever again come.

I repair to my post in the Senate with strong hopes, not, however, unmixed with fears. If the Executive will cordially cooperate in carrying out the Whig measures, all will be well.

far as I have yet heard, have terminated favorably.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I thank you for your kind suggestions as to 
the best mode of preserving my health. The attack last March 
in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> was more severe than I was aware of at the time ; 
but, thank God, my health now, notwithstanding all my labors, 
is better than it was when I came here. This I attribute to the 
exercise which I take every morning, and to the perfectly regular life which I lead. 
</p><p>
It is very uncertain when Congress will adjourn. I begin 
now to fear that it will not be until September. I shall probably 
return by the route of the White Sulphur, but of that there is 
no certainty. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jot" rel="colleague met">Mr. Tyler's</a> opinions about a Bank are giving us great 
trouble. Indeed, they not only threaten a defeat on that measure, but endanger the permanency, and the ascendency of the 
Whig cause. Is it not deplorable that such a cause should be 
put in jeopardy in such a way? He conciliates nobody by his 
particular notions. The Locos are more opposed to the scheme 
than to an old fashioned Bank, and ninety-nine out of a hundred of the Whigs are decidedly adverse to it.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 21st, to-day, from 
which I infer your good health, as I think I recognize in its tone, 
your buoyant spirits. Without ever having been laid up, I 
have not been always well since my return from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 
I have worked too hard, and want rest. This feeling has given 
rise to a serious question which I have now under consideration, 
and that is, whether I shall not resign my seat in the Senate. 
If I should return, it will be with the hope of getting away before the close of the session ; and with a resolution to take a 
less active part in the public business. 
</p><p>
You inquire what will be done with the Government Land 
Warrants. I believe I have expressed my opinion to you heretofore, fully about them ; but, without being able to specify the 
time when they shall be passed on by Congress, I should not be 
surprised if they are ultimately provided for. 
</p><p>
So Mr. G. says we are to have no fiscal agent ! That is what 
I have expected. Having rejected a National Bank, the State 
Banks, and the Sub-Treasury, I could not conceive what other 
project of an agent even <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jot" rel="colleague met">Mr. Tyler's</a> ingenuity could present. 
</p><p>
The issue of the elections this fall, however much to be regretted, perhaps ought not to surprise us. An army which believes itself betrayed by its commander-in-chief, will never fight 
well under him, or while he remains in authority. Our defeats 
have not been produced by any accession of strength to our adversaries, but simply because our friends would not go to the 
polls. I think they were wrong, but their conduct was natural

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, July 25,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1842">1842</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, I received your letter by my neighbor and friend Mr. Henry, and the good account he gives me of you induces me to transmit this answer. 
</p><p>
My opinion on the subjects of slavery and Abolition was fully 
expressed in the Senate of the United States in February,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1839">1839</a>, 
and I have seen no reason since to change it. The speech 
which I delivered on that occasion may be found in a cheap, 
although imperfect collection of my speeches, recently published 
in Cincinnati, and to that I respectfully refer you. I regret that 
I have no copy of it by me, detached from the book, or I would send it to you. 
</p><p>
I regard the existence of slavery as an evil. I regret it, and 
wish that there was not one slave in the United States. 
</p><p>
But it is an evil which, while it affects the States only, or 
principally, where it abounds, each State within which it is situated is the exclusive judge of what is best to be done with it, 
and no other State has a right to interfere in it. Kentucky has 
no right to interfere with the slavery of Virginia, and Ohio has 
no right to interfere with it in either. 
</p><p>
The jurisdiction of each State, where slavery exists, is among 
the reserved rights of the States. Congress possesses no power 
or authority to abolish it. Congress is invested with no power 
relating to it, except that which assumes its legitimate and 
continued existence. As to slavery, with the exception of the 
conservative, representative, and taxing powers of Congress, the 
States are as much beyond the control of Congress as if they 
were independent nations, unconnected by any confederative 
constitution. 
</p><p>
Although I believe slavery to be an evil, I regard it as a far 
less evil than would arise out of an immediate emancipation of 
the slaves of the United States, and their remaining here mixed 
tip in our communities. In such a contingency, I believe that a 
bloody civil war would ensue, which would terminate only by 
the extinction of the black race.
</p><p>
It results, from these opinions which I entertain, that I consider the movements of the Abolitionists as'altogether unauthorized and most unfortunate. I believe them productive of no 
good whatever, but attended with positive mischief to both the 
white and the black races. Of all the modes of separating the 
free blacks from the rest of the population of the United States, 
in my opinion, that of colonizing them in Africa is best. They 
are there in the abode of their ancestors, in a climate congenial 
to their constitutions, and with boundless territorial scope before 
them. For these and other reasons I think Africa far preferable 
to Oregon. An emigrant can be sent to Africa much cheaper 
than he can be to Oregon. He would then be not only in the 
home of his forefathers, but he might render great service to the 
natives of Africa, by introducing among them the arts of civilization and the religion of Christ, He would, moreover, be secure forever against the progress of the white man, which he 
would be far from being in Oregon. 
</p><p>
I have regretted extremely the agitation of abolition in the 
free States. . It has done no good, but harm. It will do no good. 
The great body of Abolitionists, like the great mass of every 
party, I have no doubt, is honest, sincere, and humane. Their 
leaders deceive them, and will endeavor to profit by them. 
They will seek to ride into public office, and to snatch public 
honor, upon the delusions which they propagate. 
</p><p>
Abolition is a delusion which can not last. It is impossible it 
should endure. What is it? In pursuit of a principle a great 
principle, if you please, it undertakes to tread down and- trample 
in the dust all opposing principles, however sacred. It sets up 
the right of the people of one State to dictate to the people of 
other States. It arrays State against State. /To make the black 
man free, it would virtually enslave the white man, } With a single idea some of its partisans rush on blindly, regardless of all 
consequences. They have dared even to threaten our glorious 
Union with dissolution. And suppose that unhallowed object 
achieved, would it emancipate the slaves? What is their next 
step? Is it to light up a war between the dissevered parts of the 
Union, and through blood, devastation, and conflagration, to 
march forward to emancipation? Are they at all sure that through 
such diabolical means they would be able finally to arrive at 
their object? No, my friend, let each State, and the people of 
each State, take care of their own interests, leaving other States, 
and the people of other States, to take care of theirs. We have 
enough to do in our respective and legitimate spheres of action 
enough for the exercise of all the charities and sympathies of our 
nature. 
</p><p>
But what is ultimately to become of slavery? asks the impatient Abolitionist. I can not tell him with any certainty. I 
have no doubt that the merciful Providence, which permitted its 
introduction into our country against the wishes of our ancestors, 
will, according to His own good pleasure and time, provide for 
its mitigation or termination. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, we have had much to encourage us. Our 
Revolution led to the cessation of the African slave trade with the 
United States. It altogether ceased in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1808">1808</a>. Many States 
emancipated their slaves, not by the perilous process of an immediate liberation, but by the gradual and cautious proceeding 
of a slow and regulated emancipation, liberating the offspring at 
mature age, and leaving the parents in slavery ; thus making 
preparation for the proper use of the liberty which their children 
were to enjoy. Every where a spirit of humanity. was, more 
and more, infusing itself into the laws for the regulation of the 
treatment of slaves, until it was checked, in some places, by the 
agitation of Abolition. Some States, where the proportion of 
slaves was not very great in comparison with the whites, were 
beginning seriously to think about the practicability of a gradual 
emancipation within their limits, but they, too, have been checked 
by the intemperate zeal of Abolitionists. The feasibility of 
African colonization has been demonstrated, and the Society, with 
its limited means, has been quietly prosecuting its noble object. 
</p><p>
By some of the means indicated, and others hidden from our 
view, by an all-wise Providence, we may cherish the hope that. 
if violent Abolitionists will cease stirring up strife and agitating 
the passions, we may ultimately alleviate the evils, if not eradicate the existence of slavery in our land. 
</p><p>
The generation that established our independence achieved a 
great and glorious work. Succeeding generations have accomplished much in advancing the growth, the power, and the greatness of this nation. We must leave some things to posterity, and among others the task of making adequate provision for the institution of Slavery. 
</p><p>
In spite of slavery, our arms triumphed in the revolutionary 
struggle. And it is not too much to assert that, if Abolition had 
developed itself then, as it since has done, we should have failed./ 
We should have been unable to form the Confederation, or subsequently to have adopted the present Constitution. In spite of 
slavery, we were successful in the second war with Great Britain. 
And in neither war, it is a gratifying historical fact, was the 
enemy able, by all his arts of seduction, to withdraw many slaves 
from their fidelity. In spite of slavery, we have moved onward 
in our march to power and greatness, augmenting our population, 
in a period only co-extensive with that of my own life, from two 
and a half to seventeen millions. 
</p><p>
If our country is now writhing under the agony of extreme 
pecuniary distress and embarrassment, it has not been produced 
by slavery, at least not by black slavery. It has been brought 
about, I think, by the exercise of arbitrary power, but not that 
which the master exerts over his black slave. 
</p><p>
Let us cease to agitate a topic which divides, distracts, and 
inflames the community ; which tends to array man against man. 
State against State, and section against section, and which 
threatens the greatest of all possible calamities which could befall 
this people, the dissolution of the union of these States. Let us, 
in place of discord and dissension, cultivate peace, harmony, and 
good will among the people and the States of this Confederacy. 
And let us recollect that we have other duties ^far higher duties 
— to perform toward our country, toward posterity, and toward 
the world, than even the extirpation of African slavery, however 
much its original introduction among us is to be deplored. 
</p><p>
I have thus, in answer to your inquiries, given you a full, candid, and unreserved exposition of my opinions and feelings, on 
the several subjects to which they relate. I hope they will 
be received and examined in the same friendly and frank spirit 
in which they are communicated.

My DEAR Sir, I received your obliging letter with its inclosure. The arrangement, by which Mr. Epes Sargent has undertaken to compose a biography of me, was made by the young men of New York, prior to my learning, through Mr. Toland, 
your friendly wishes. It would have been, otherwise, very agreeable to me to have acceded to them. 
</p><p>
Mr. Sargent's work, I presume, from what I have heard of its 
progress, is now nearly ready for the press. I wish he had a 
better subject for his pen ; and I fear that it may be with him, 
as it has been with many of the artists, who have taken my 
portrait, that, owing to the defects of the original, nothing very 
Striking or interesting will be produced. I am sure that it will 
be no more his than it was their fault. I have perused your song 
with lively interest, and I cordially thank you for it. If my 
judgment is not biased by the flattering expressions and sentiments toward me, which it contains, I think it will be found to 
be extremely well adapted to the popular use for which it was 
intended. 
</p><p>
Accept, my dear sir, my grateful acknowledgments for your 
friendly views and intentions toward me j and assurances of my 
esteem and regard.

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, September 23,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1842">1842</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your obliging letter, and candidly 
thank you for the sentiments of regard and friendship toward 
me which it communicates ; and I am extremely happy to receive from you such strong expressions of confidence in the 
Whig character of your State. The apathy which you nevertheless describe as the cause of the loss of your Legislature is 
greatly to be deplored. Besides depriving the country of the 
services of an able and upright Senator, it inspires our adversaries with fresh hopes, and will stimulate them to make invigorated exertions. It is to be regretted that the force of the 
truth, that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, is not more 
generally felt. ' 
</p><p>
With respect to my becoming a candidate for the high office 
to which you refer, I can add nothing to what I said in a public 
speech delivered at a Barbecue near this place, in June last. I 
have no wish to be forced upon the people ; no desire that my 
name shall be used, unless I am fully persuaded that it is wanted 
by a majority of my countrymen. The prevalence of the 
apathy noticed by you makes it diflicult to comprehend their 
real wishes ; and there is certainly some danger that the road to 
victory may be lost by the Whigs from the defeats which they 
suff"er. There is, however, ample time yet to form some satisfactory opinion as to the probable views of the majority of the 
people of the United States. If we have our troubles, our adversaries are not free from theirs. 
 
The course of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jot" rel="colleague met">Mr. Tyler</a> has been such as to produce disgust 
and dissatisfaction. But if he has been faithless, our friends in 
Congress have been true and faithful. Should they be abandoned 
because of his perfidy? Why, when their defeat is precisely what 
he desires? For there can be no longer a doubt that he is wielding all the power and influence of his office for the benefit of 
those who opposed his election, against those whose exertions and 
suffrages secured it. 
</p><p>
I wish I could see any near prospect of the restoration of a 
sound currency. If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jot" rel="colleague met">Mr. Tyler</a> adheres to the opinions on which 
he has acted, there is none. As to his Exchequer, it would make 
such a fearful addition to the already enormous power of the 
Executive, that I have never for a moment thought it ought to 
be adopted. 
</p><p>
I suppose that the only alternative left to the country is to 
hobble on as well as it can with the State Banks, incompetent 
as I am obliged to regard them to supply a general currency of 
uniform value. 
</p><p>
I am unable to say when I shall have the gratification of visiting your State (Virginia). I shall seize with eagerness the fijst 
occasion I can to enjoy it. 
</p><p>
With great regard I am your friend and obedient servant.

My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 28th ultimo, with 
the small volume accompanying it, containing your Biographical 
Notice of me. Amid preparations for my departure for Louisiana, where I propose passing at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> a portion of the 
ensuing winter, I have not yet given it the deliberate perusal to

of your favors, and of my constant regard. 
</p><p>
My voyage has been distinguished by enthusiastic demonstrations, wherever I have been. My effort has been rather to 
repress than to excite them. So far I have succeeded in avoiding my tour being given a political aspect. I expect to remain 
at the South until some time in February, I feel already benefited by the climate, although my health was not bad when I 
left home. 
</p><p>
Your sources of political information are so much better than 
mine that I can add nothing to the stock wliich you possess. 
Every where I find great confidence prevailing among the Whigs 
</p><p>
of their success in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1844">1844</a>. All the elections of the past fall 
which have been lost by them, have been lost not by the increased strength of their opponents, but by voters remaining absent from feelings of mortification and disgust, created by the 
acting President. Such is the view which I find every where 
taken. The problem to be solved is, whether the Whigs can 
be relied in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1844">1844</a>. I hope and believe they will be. 
</p><p>
I have seen a Mr. Carter and his lady here, near relations of

Dear Sir, I have duly received your friendly letter, and the 
box to which it refers, containing half a dozen bottles of American Cologne water, all in good order, and I tender you my warm 
thanks for the acceptable present, and the friendly sentiments 
toward me, which induced you to offer it. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a>, who is a

</p><p>
It was long ago remarked that any man who made a blade 
of grass grow, where one did not before, was a public benefactor. That citizen is an equal benefactor, by whose skill and 
industry an article of consumption is produced at home, and the 
necessity of sending abroad the money to purchase it, is avoided. 
To ensure the prosperity of our country, and to escape those afflicting revulsions, which are so ruinous, we must learn and 
practice the invaluable truth, to sell as much, and buy as little 
as possible, abroad. Every prudent planter and farmer acts on 
that principle, and what is wise in individuals, is wise in nations. 
I congratulate you on the perfection to which you have brought 
the manufacture of a very agreeable article, in extensive use, 
and tender you cordial wishes for your success, prosperity, and 
happiness.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, Allow me to suggest a subject for one of your 
Tracts which, treated in your popular and condensed way, I think 
would be attended with great and good effect, I mean Abolition. 
</p><p>
It is manifest that the ultras of that party are extremely mischievous, and are hurrying on the country to fearful consequences. They are not to be conciliated by the Whigs. Engrossed 
with a single idea, they care for nothing else. They would see 
the administration of the Government precipitate the nation into 
absolute ruin before they would lend a helping hand to arrest its 
career. They treat worse and denounce most those who treat 
them best, who so far agree with them as to admit slavery to be 
an evil. Witness their conduct toward Mr. Briggs and Mr. 
Adams, in Massachusetts, and toward me. 
</p><p>
I will give you an outline of the manner in which I would handle it. Show the origin of slavery. Trace its introduction to the British Government. Show how it is disposed of by the Federal Constitution. That it is left exclusively to the States, except in regard to fugitives, direct taxes and representation. Show that the agitation of the question in the free States, will first destroy all harmony, and finally lead to disunion. That the consequences of disunion perpetual war the extinction of the African race ultimate military despotism. 
</p><p>
But the great aim and object of your Tract should be to arouse 
the laboring classes in the free States against Abolition. Depict 
the consequences to them of immediate abolition. The slaves 
being free, would be dispersed throughout the Union ; they 
would enter into competition with the free laborer ; with the 
American, the Irish, the German ; reduce his wages ; be confounded with him, and affect his moral and social standing. 
And as the ultras go for both abolition and amalgamation, show 
that their object is to unite, in marriage, the laboring white 
man, and the laboring black man, and to reduce the white laboring man to the despised and degraded condition of the black 
man. 
</p><p>
I would show their opposition to colonization. Show its 
humane, religious and patriotic aim. That they are to separate 
those whom God has separated. Why do the Abolitionists oppose colonization? To keep and amalgamate together the two 
races, in violation of God's will, and to keep the blacks here, 
that they may interfere with, degrade, and debase the laboring 
whites. Show that the British nation is co-operating with the 
Abolitionists, for the purpose of dissolving the Union, the 
World's Convention, etc. 
</p><p>
You can make a powerful article that will be felt in every 
extremity of the Union. 
</p><p>
I am perfectly satisfied it will do great good. 
</p><p>
Let me hear from you on this subject.

My dear Sir, Do not imagine that I am forgetful of you, or insensible to your exertions for the public, and for me. I have 
been absent from home, my correspondence is excessively oppressive, and not until this afternoon have I been able to read 
your life of me. In the main, its facts are correct. It is a 
good outline, well-adapted to its purpose. There are a few in accuracies, and too much commendation and panegyric. I do 
not know that it is worth while to point out the errors. I would do it if I could write on the margin. 
</p><p>
You are unjust toward the Compromise Act. It saved our 
manufactures, gave them stability, and they did well, until the 
disorders in the currency, and consequent revulsions, affected 
them, and every thing, and every body else. Up to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1840">1840</a>, it 
worked well, and afforded a sufficient measure of protection. 
It was the duty of a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Van Buren</a> Congress to provide for the period beyond that, but it would not perform its duty.

I send you inclosed a power of attorney from Henry, to sign 
one, and indorse another note for $5,000, which I left with you 
to be discounted at the Northern Bank, along with two others 
that I also left. I wish you to attend to that business particularly ; I think the 20th February is the time. I also inclose the

It will be time, on my return home, to decide on your proposal about water rotting hemp. In the mean time, I expect Mr.

the new ground and piece at Mansfield. 
</p><p>
Tell Thomas that I think he had better make a contract with 
</p><p>
Mr. (I forget his name), of Clarke, for his crops of hemp offered us, at the market price between the time of delivery and 
the 1st of September, paying interest upon every ten tons, from time to time, as delivered. I think the probability is that hemp 
will fall below rather than rise above the price of $4, at which you state it now to be. 
</p><p>
My health has been generally good, but I am suffering just now with cold and its effects. I shall leave here about the 20th

[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">MR. CLAY</a>] TO HENRY WHITE AND OTHERS. 
</p><p>
Macon, March IT,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1844">1844</a>. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen, I have received, at this place, the letter which 
you addressed to me upon the 24th ultimo, and I perused it attentively, with some feelings of concern and regret. 
</p><p>
I received the letter which was addressed to me last autumn 
by the National Clay Club, and I have a strong conviction, although I would not assert positively, that I replied to it, prior to 
my departure from home. I know it was my intention to answer it, and to answer every communication which I received. 
If I did not do so, it was an unintentional omission. I must, 
nevertheless, say, that I have need of all the indulgence of my 
friends and correspondents. My correspondence is very extensive, and is becoming more and more so. It occupies, when I 
am at home, my time constantly. Many of the Clubs which 
have done me the honor to assume my name, have put themselves in correspondence with me, and some of them have even 
complimented me by making me an honorary member of their 
associations. You can judge from this how numerous the letters must be that I have to transmit. 
</p><p>
I hope your failure to receive my reply to your letter, last 
autumn, was unattended with any disadvantage. On the subject of the Tariff, of which your communication treated, I have 
so frequently, so fully, and so clearly expressed myself, that I 
am sure I could not add another new word or new idea. 
</p><p>
I assure you that I entertain a very high opinion of the motives, objects, and services of the National Clay Club. Many of 
the members are my personal, and all of them my political friends. 
It would be impossible for me to regard them with any other 
feelings than those of gratitude. It is quite possible that I may 
have received information that some of the operations of the 
Club were not as useful and beneficial as could be wished, although I have no distinct recollection of the tenor of such information. If I ever did receive any such, it made no unfavorable impression, and created no prejudice on my mind against the 
Club. I know, in the zeal and ardor of friends, that they sometimes erroneously estimate the value and importance of their 
respective services, and I am always ready to make allowances 
accordingly. But I deeply regret the existence of the jealousies 
and misconceptions among those between whom nothing but 
harmony and cordial co-operation should prevail. And if, as is 
to be inferred from your letter, there are any differences among 
my  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> friends, I conjure you all to hasten to accommodate them, and to unite, in a spirit of mutual concession and 
conciliation, as a band of brothers in the great struggle which 
is before us. Most happily, concord, harmony, and union, characterize the votaries of our cause, generally, throughout the 
Union, and I should be greatly disappointed and mortified if 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> formed an exception. 
</p><p>
I am happy to inform you that the information which I have 
</p><p>
received, during the progress of my journey, is of the most 
cheering and satisfactory kind, every where. Even in Alabama, of which I had entertained no hopes when T left home, our 
friends will make a great effort, and they confidently anticipate 
a victory.

Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, I arrived here on the 12th, very much fatigued, 
but my general health is pretty good. 
</p><p>
I have a note in the Branch Bank for fifteen hundred dollars, 
due about the 1st of next month. Inclosed I send you a check 
for eighteen hundred dollars, fifteen hundred of which I wish 
applied to the payment of that note, and the balance to the payment of my interest due to the University. 
</p><p>
I expect to reach  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> toward the last of this month, 
and to remain there until the 4th or 5th of May, and shall be 
glad to hear from you at that place. 
</p><p>
Tell Thomas that there is a fair prospect of selling the bagging and rope at Savannah and Charleston, and that I adhere to 
the opinion that it is best to send them there after I get home. 
</p><p>
Give my love to your mamma, and tell her I will write her 
before I leave this place. Remember me also to Susan.

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, July 1,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1844">1844</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received and thank you for your friendly 
letter, and the copy of " The Monitor." You have justly conceived my meaning, when I refeiTcd, in my Texas letter, to a 
considerable and respectable portion of the Confederacy. And 
you might have strengthened your construction of the paragraph 
by reference to the fact that, at the date of my letter, the States 
of Ohio, Vermont and Massachusetts had, almost unanimously, 
declared against annexation ; the Legislature of Georgia had declined to recommend it, and other States were believed to be adverse to the measure. As to the idea of my courting the Abolitionists it is perfectly absurd. No man in the United States has 
been half so much abused by them as I have been. 
</p><p>
I consider the Union a great political partnership ; and that 
new members ought not to be admitted into the concern at the 
imminent hazard of its dissolution. Personally I could have no 
objection to the annexation of Texas ; but I certainly would be 
unwilling to see the existing Union dissolved or seriously jeoparded for the sake of acquiring Texas. If any one desires to 
know the leading and paramount object of my public life, the 
preservation of this Union will furnish him the key. 
</p><p>
From developments now being made in South Carolina, it is 
perfectly manifest that a party exists in that State seeking a dissolution of the Union, and for that purpose employing the pretext of the rejection of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jot" rel="colleague met">Mr. Tyler's</a> abominable treaty. South 
Carolina being surrounded by slave States, would, in the event 
of a dissolution of the Union, suffer only comparative evils, but 
it is otherwise with Kentucky ; she has the boundary of the 
Ohio extending four hundred miles on three free States. What 
would her condition be in the event of the greatest calamity that 
could befall this nation? 
</p><p>
In Kentucky the Texas question will do the Whig cause no 
prejudice. I am glad to perceive, in the proceedings of the Clay 
Club at Tuscaloosa, a similar belief expressed as to Alabama. 
It was a bubble blown up by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jot" rel="colleague met">Mr. Tyler</a> in the most exceptionable manner, for sinister purposes, and its bursting has injured 
no body but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a>. 
</p><p>
Retaining an agreeable recollection of the pleasure which I 
derived from forming your acquaintance last Spring, I remain 
your friend and obedient servant.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, Many thanks for your obliging letter of the 11th inst., and for its interesting contents. It demonstrates very 
great and patriotic activity on the part of the Commercial Committee, and I hope that the success of its labors may correspond 
with its good intentions. We feel the greatest anxiety about the issue of your Governor's election, and our intelligence concerning it is somewhat conflicting. 
</p><p>
You are aware that there is a Whig Committee at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, consisting of the Hon. Messrs. Garrett Davis and Willis 
Green, the object of which is to distribute documents, of which a great many have been sent to Pennsylvania. I understand the 
funds of the Committee are getting low, and if you should have any surplus in your exchequer, they will be very glad to receive some assistance.

I should be very happy should it be in my power to serve your house with the sugar planters of Louisiana, and I authorize you at any time to refer them to my name.

My dear Sir, I duly received your favor of the 18th instant, 
communicating your desire to prepare and compose a work, to 
be entitled, " The Life and Times of Henry Clay," and you invite an expression of my opinion of such an undertaking, and 
the contribution of any materials toward it in my possession. Such a work, truly and faithfully written, might be made very 
interesting. But every thing will depend upon its execution. I believe you possess sufficient ability to perform the task, if you 
have sufficient time and sufficient materials. However, this is a moment of too great interest and excitement either to decide 
definitely upon the propriety of such a work, or for me to make now any contributions toward its composition. I hope we shall 
both live some years yet, and have many opportunities of seeing and conferring with each other upon the subject, after 
which we can come to a satisfactory conclusion. 
</p><p>
A few weeks more will decide the arduous contest in which we have been engaged, and if I am to credit the confident assurances which I receive from all quarters, there is no doubt of a triumphant result.

My dear Sir, My feelings prompt me to offer you my cordial acknowledgments for your friendly letter of the 21st instant. 
I entertain sentiments of the liveliest gratitude for the kind interest you have taken and continue to cherish in me. And I 
am greatly obliged by the desire you manifest that I should 
seek, in the resources of religion, consolation for all the vexations and disappointments of life. I hope you will continue 
your prayers for me, since I trust I am not altogether unworthy 
of them. I have long been convinced of the paramount importance of the Christian religion. I have, for many years, fervently sought its blessings. I shall persevere in seeking them, 
and I hope, ultimately, to attain a firm faith and confidence in 
its promises. There is nothing for which I feel so anxious. 
May God, in his infinite mercy, grant what I so ardently desire.

Should you pass this way, at any time, I shall be most happy

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, December IV,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1844">1844</a>. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen, I duly received your friendly letter transmitting 
the proceedings of a public meeting held in the city of New 
Haven, in respect to the late Presidential election. The patriotic 
spirit, manifest in the whole of them, is worthy of Connecticut, 
worthy of its renowned seat of learning, and worthy of the Whig 
cause. For the sentiments of attachment, confidence and friendship toward myself, which they exhibit, and which you so kindly reiterate in your letter, I offer the warm acknowledgments of a grateful heart. My obligations to Connecticut and my friendly 
intercourse with many of her eminent sons, during a long period of time, will be faithfully remembered while I continue to live. 
</p><p>
I share with you, gentlemen, in regrets on account of the unexpected issue of the recent election. My own personal concern 
in it is entitled to very little consideration, although I affect no 
indifference in that respect. The great importance of the event 
arises out of the respective principles in contest between the two 
parties, the consequences to which it may lead and the alleged 
means by which it was brought about, of which, however, I do 
not allow myself particularly to speak. 
</p><p>
The policy of the country in regard to the protection of American industry, a few months ago, seemed to be rapidly acquiring 
a permanent and fixed character. The Southern and Southwestern portions of the Union had been reproached at the North 
for want of sufficient interest and sympathy in its welfare. Yielding to the joint influence of their own reflections and experience, 
the Slave States were fast subscribing to the justice and expediency of a Tariff for revenue, with discriminations for protection. At such an auspicious moment, instead of cordially meeting the Slave States and placing the principle of protectioji upon 
impregnable and desirable ground, a sufficient number of the free 
States, to be decisive of the contest, abandoned what was beHeved to be their own cherished policy and have aided, if not 
in its total subversion, in exposing it to imminent hazard and uncertainty. Discouragement has taken the place of confidence in 
the business of the country, enterprise is checked, and no one 
knows to what employment he can now safely direct his exertions. Instead of a constantly augmenting home market, we 
are in danger of experiencing its decline at a time when the foreign market is absolutely glutted with American productions, 
cotton especially, which is now selling at a lower price than was ever before known. It is probably destined to fall still lower. 
The final and not distaui lesult will be, especially if large importations shall be stimulated by low duties, a drain of the specie 
of the country, with all its train of terrible consequences, on which I have neither inclination nor time to dwell. 
</p><p>
If the cause of the Whigs had triumphed, the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands would have been 
secured, and that great national inheritance would have been preserved for the benefit of the present and future generations. 
I shall be most agreeably disap-pointed if it be not wasted in a few years by graduation and r /her projects of alienation, leaving no traces of permanent benefj behind. 
</p><p>
I could not touch upon other great measures of public policy, which it was the purpose of the Whigs to endeavor to establish, 
without giving to this letter an unsuitable length. They may be briefly stated to have aimed at the purity of the Government, 
the greater prosperity of the people, and additional security to their liberties and to the Union, and, with all, the preservation 
of the peace, the honor and the good faith of the nation. The Whigs were most anxious to avoid a foreign war, for the sake of 
acquiring a foreign territory, which, under the circumstances of the acquisition, could not fail to produce domestic discord, and 
expose the character of the country, in the eyes of an impartial world, to severe animadversions. 
</p><p>
But our opponents have prevailed in the late contest, and the Whigs are, for the present, denied the satisfaction of carrying out 
their measures of national policy. Believing that they are indispensable to the welfare of the country, I am unwilling to 
relinquish the fond hope that they may be finally established, whether I live to witness that event or not. In the mean time, 
those to whose hands the administration of public affairs is confided ought to have a fair trial. Let us ever indulge an anxious 
desire that the evils we have apprehended may not be realized, that the peace of our country may be undisturbed, its honor remain unsullied, and its prosperity continue unimpeded. 
</p><p>
To guard, however, against adverse results, the resolution of the Whigs of the city of New Haven steadfastly to adhere to the Whig cause and principles, is wise and patriotic. 
</p><p>
I should be most happy to visit once more New England, and especially New Haven, which has done me so much honor by 
giving me, at the late election, the largest majority ever given by that city in a contested election. I shall embrace, with great 
pleasure, any opportunity, should any ever offer, to accept your obliging invitation. 
</p><p>
I tender to you, gentlemen, my cordial thanks for your friendly wishes and kind regards for me and mine, and I hope that one and all of you may long live in health, happiness, and prosperity

Dear Sir, I received your friendly letter, and thank you for 
the kind feelings toward me which it expresses. Your suggestion that I would prepare a journal of my public life, embracing 
a narrative of all the slanders which have been so profusely propagated against me, is received in the same friendly spirit in which 
it was made. As to the calumnies circulated against me, many 
of them, I dare say, never reached me, and I wish to forget them 
and their vile authors as soon as I can. I hope God will forgive 
them. I do not desire to soil myself by any contact with them. 
The best demonstration of their falsehood is the testimony in 
my favor, borne by my neighbors, and by the people of Kentucky, uniformly, during a period of upward of forty years.

My dear Sir, I am sorry that after having remained in Lexmgton, I hope agreeably, for two months, you should be about 
to leave us in not as good health as you have enjoyed during your sojourn. 
</p><p>
With respect to the composition of the work which you have 
so much at heart, and which brought you to this city, I think 
now, as I stated to you at first, that every thing depends upon 
the execution, that most important word in language. You have 
shov/n me most, if not all you have written, and, as I formed the 
subject of it, perhaps I am not a competent, as I certainly am not 
an impartial, judge. But, unless I am already biased, I do think 
that, so far, you have made good progress, and may ask leave to 
sit again. What you have written may require an attentive revisal, and some new arrangement of its parts, before it is finally 
sent to the press, that bourne from which a traveler does not always safely return. 
</p><p>
I need not say that by far the most important, the historical, 
part of your work remains to be entered upon. I hope you will 
get successfully through it, to accomplish which, I hardly need 
say, will require great patience, much research and study, and a 
large measure of candor and impartiality.

to you any minute information about them. All that I know, 
in the general, is that they came from England to the colony of 
Virginia, some time after its establishment, and settled, I believe, 
on the south side of James River. The descendants of the 
original stock are very numerous, and much dispersed, many of 
them residing in Virginia and Kentucky. A branch, or branches 
of the family remained in England, and among their descendants was Mr. J. Clay, recently quite a distinguished member of 
the British House of Commons. 
</p><p>
My maternal ancestors also came from England, and settled 
in Hanover county, Virginia, about the beginning of the last 
century. George Hudson, my maternal grandfather, died about 
the year 1770, in that county. 
</p><p>
This is about as much as I can inform you in regard to my 
ancestors, and from this statement, you will, I hope, be able to 
incorporate all that is material in your narrative.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, Our mutual friend, Mr. Mitchell, of Frankfort, 
delivered to me the day before yesterday your letter, with several publications under your name, in respect to the unfortunate 
controversy which has arisen in the Methodist Episcopal Church 
of the United States, all of which I have attentively perused. 
You desire an expression of my opinion on certain inquiries 
communicated in your letter. 
</p><p>
I have long entertained for that Church sentiments of profound 
esteem and regard, and I have the happiness of numbering 
among its members some of the best friends I have in the world. 
I will add, with great truth, that I have witnessed, with much 
satisfaction, the flourishing condition of the Church, and the 
good sense and wisdom which have generally characterized the 
administration of its affairs, as far as I have observed it. 
</p><p>
It was, therefore, with the deepest regret that I heard, in the 
course of the past year, of the danger of a division of the 
Church, in consequence of a difference of opinion existing on 
the delicate and unhappy subject of slavery. A division, for 
such a cause, would be an event greatly to be deplored, both on 
account of the Church itself and its political tendency. Indeed 
scarcely any public occurrence has happened for a' long time that 
gave me so much real concern and pain as the menaced separation of the Church, by a line throwing all the Free States on 
one side, and all the Slave States on the other. 
</p><p>
I will not say that such a separation would necessarily produce 
a dissolution of the political union of these States ; but the example would be fraught with imminent danger, and, in co-operation with other causes unfortunately existing, its tendency on 
the stability of the Confederacy would be perilous and alarming. 
</p><p>
Entertaining these views, it would afford me the highest satisfaction to hear of an adjustment of the controversy, a reconciliation between the opposing parties in the Church, and the 
preservation of its unity. 
</p><p>
I limit myself to the political aspect of the subject, without 
expressing any opinion on either of the plans of compromise 
and settlement which have been published, which I could not 
do without exposing myself to improper imputations. 
</p><p>
With fervent hopes and wishes that some arrangement of the 
difficulty may be devised and agreed upon, which shall preserve 
the Church in union and harmony, I am respectfully your obedient servant.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received your letter of the 17th instant. Compression is your forte in composition ; but is there 
not danger of your elaborating too much the old calumny of bargain, etc.? The division you propose of the subject appears to me to be natural and suitable 
</p><p>
When I meet Governor Letcher I will endeavor to prevail on him to give the certificate you desire. He may perhaps consent 
to furnish it to be used only in the contingency of his death. If living, and the statement of ]Mr. B.'s agency should be denied, 
appealed to as he is as a witness, I am sure he would be willing to testify. You will find Mr. Buchanan's speech, what you want, 
in Gales and Seaton's Congressional Debates, although I can not refer you to the page. Governor Letcher could refer to it. 
</p><p>
It would be well not to publish Colonel Sloan's statement until I hear from Mr. Reilly, the Texan Charge des Affaires. I endeavored, through him, to procure from General Houston a confirmation of Colonel Sloan's testimony, and have not yet learned what success attended the efibrt. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Dear Sir, I received your kind letter and thank you for the 
friendly sentiments which it conveys. I have ceased to have 
any, I never had many^ personal regrets on account of the issue 
of the Presidential election. Those which I most felt were excited for my country and for my friends. They remain undiminished. And for no portion of* them were my sympathies 
more strongly awakened than for our countrywomen. Their 
hearts, every where, assured them of the deep and durable interests involved in the contest, and intuitively prompted them to 
avert all calamity from our land, if they could. Mine gratefully 
owns the kind partiality which they manifested toward me. The 
ladies of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> are entitled to a large share of the great obligation which I owe to their whole sex. 
</p><p>
I return the blank notes .which you transmitted, with my name 
affixed to each as you desired. I add a similar one for Mrs. MandelL 
</p><p>
I will thank you to make my respects and my acknowledgments to the poet mechanic, of whose versification you have 
sent a specimen so creditable to his talent.

My dear Sir, -I received your favor, proposing to send the 
proofs to me of your first volume. I am now en route to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, where I shall be glad to receive them, hoping to find in 
the introduction, as intimated in your previous letter, an exoneration of me from any responsibility for the composition of the 
work. It is the best if not only mode of correcting the error 
committed in the prospectus. 
 
I saw Judge Brooke at the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=white sulphur springs" rel="city">White Sulphur Springs</a>. He tells 
me that he has packed up a large bundle of my letters, and placed 
them in the care of a friend, to be delivered to you. He thinks 
that you may derive useful matter from them. He has returned 
to St. Julien, his residence near  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>. 
</p><p>
I have also received a package of some forty of my letters 
addressed to the late <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsj" rel="colleague friend met">J. S. JOHNSTON</a>, Senator from Louisiana, sent 
me by the widow of his only son. I will try to find some person to forward them by to you from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. 
</p><p>
I have not yet heard from General Houston ; but Mr. Reiley, 
the husband of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="spouse met">my wife's</a> niece, still believes I shall receive a communication from him.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, A temporary absence from home has delayed my 
acknowledgment of the receipt of your favor of the 7th ultimo. 
I have not received the pamphlet to which it refers. But any 
expression of my opinion, as to your plan of compromise between the two divisions of the Methodist Church, would be now 
wholly unimportant, if at any time it would have been worth 
any thing, since a separation seems to be inevitable. When 
such is the case, in human affairs, I think the best way is to seek 
to avoid any mischievous consequences. 
</p><p>
I must continue to regret the separation, because I believe it 
to have an evil tendency. Others think differently ; and my 
hope is that they may, in the end, prove to be right, and I wrong. 
</p><p>
It was not my intention, in my former letter, to impute any 
error to the Southern portion of the Church, on the unhappy subject of Slavery, the immediate cause of division. 
</p><p>
My opinion is, that the existence of Slavery, or the fact of 
owning slaves, in States which authorize the institution of Slavery, does not rightfully fall within the jurisdiction of Ecclesiastical bodies. The law of the land is paramount, and ought 
not to be contravened by any spiritual tribunal.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, December 16,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1845">1845</a>. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen, I received to-day at this place, the letter which 
on the 1st inst., you did me the honor to address to me, from 
the hands of Henry White, Esq., one of the subscribers to it. 
He at the same time delivered to me the book, beautifully printed 
and bound, entitled " A Testimonial of Gratitude and Affection 
to Henry Clay," containing the proceedings of a meeting of my 
friends in the city of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, publicly held at the County 
Court-house, on Wednesday evening, December 19,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1844">1844</a>, in pursuance of a call of the National Clay Club, and containing 
also several thousand names of both sexes, young and old, of 
those who have done me the great honor of contributing a testimonial to my public services, to the principles and measures 
which I have endeavored to establish, and to my exertions in 
the common cause which we have espoused. 
</p><p>
It is utterly impossible, gentlemen, for me to find language of 
sufficient force and strength, to express to you the emotions of 
gratitude and thankfulness excited in my breast by this precious 
and affecting testimonial. It will be ever warmly cherished by 
me throughout my life, and be preserved and transmitted to my 
descendants, as the most honorable legacy which I could bequeath to them. And I request you to say to one and all of the 
contributors, that their respective names are not more indelibly 
recorded in the splendid book which they have sent me, than in 
grateful impressions on my heart. 
</p><p>
I am also charged by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met spouse">Mrs. Clay</a> to present her cordial and 
respectful thanks (to which I beg leave to add my own), to the 
ladies and gentlemen who have had the goodness to send her a 
casket of rich jewels, which Mr. White kindly delivered into 
her own hands, for their highly valuable present. Her grateful 
obligations for it, she enjoins me to say, are not at all diminished 
by the reflection that considerations apart from any merits of her 
own, have prompted the generous offer of it to her acceptance. 
</p><p>
I embrace the occasion to bear my testimony, and to tender 
my thanks to you, gentlemen, the trustees appointed under the 
authority of the public meeting in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, before mentioned, for the delicacy, the fidelity, and the honor, with which 
you have executed the trust confided to you. And I have great 
pleasure in expressing my thanks and gratitude to Mr. White, in 
particular, for the great trouble and inconvenience which he has 
encountered, by performing a long journey, at a most inclement 
season, to fulfill the commission entrusted to him. 
</p><p>
I am, gentlemen, with sentiments of the highest respect and 
regard, your grateful and faithful friend, and obedient servant.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, I duly received your favor, and take pleasure in 
answering it. The desire to trace out your ancestry is very 
natural. I have often felt it in respect to mine, but I have no 
written, and very imperfect traditional accounts of them. I am 
apprehensive, however, that my parental stock is different from 
the family of Clays described by you, as having been established 
in Middletown, Connecticut. My ancestors emigrated from 
England, and settled in the colony of Virginia, early, I believe, 
in the 17th century. My father was born there, not far from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, on the south side of James River. He removed to 
Hanover county, shortly before my birth in that county. His 
name was John, and he was sometimes called Sir John Clay (as 
I have seen in the record of judicial proceedings), but he had 
no legitimate right to that title. It was a soubriquet which he 
somehow acquired. He had but one brother, Edward Clay, 
who removed at an early period into North Carolina, where he 
lived and died, leaving a large family. 
</p><p>
I never knew my father, who died in my infancy, nor my 
grandfather. Left an orphan, struggling for subsistence and education, and removing, before I reached my majority, to this State, 
where I plunged first into an active professional business, and 
then into political affairs, I have had but little leisure to prosecute inquiries concerning my ancestors. And now, I shall so 
soon meet them in another, and I hope a better state, that I have 
thought it hardly necessary to institute any. I think it is quite 
probable that the Clays, from whom we both descended, were 
originally of the same family, although it may not be practicable 
now to trace the exact degree of connection. When I was in 
England, I met with some persons bearing the name of Clay, 
and from conversation with them, I had reason to suppose that 
we all sprung from the same stock, 
</p><p>
I am very thankful for the assurance contained in your letter, 
that your family have all done me the honor to entertain confidence in me, and that those of them who are entitled to the exercise of the elective franchise, have voted with the Whigs. I 
shall be most happy, if, during the remnant of my life, I shall 
continue to merit their good opinion. 
</p><p>
I pray you to communicate my respectful regards to your venerable grandfather, and accept for yourself assurances of the 
respect and esteem, and the wishes for your welfare and happiuess of your friend and obedient servant. 
</p><p>
P. S. My father was a Baptist preacher. Mr. Eleazer Clay near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, Va., was also a Baptist preacher for more than 
sixty years, and my only surviving full brother is a preacher of the same denomination.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your friendly letter of the 9th instant, and am greatly obliged by your kind intention to send me 
a copy of ''Graydon's Memoirs." I should receive it with 
pleasure, and no doubt would peruse it with profit. I saw that 
you were a candidate for Congress on the Native American ticket. 
1 did not for a moment suppose that in assuming that position 
you had abandoned any of your long-cherished Whig principles. 
</p><p>
There is much in the principles of the Native American party 
to commend it to deliberate consideration ; but as a separate and 
distinct party, I have not imagined that it could succeed in the 
United States. Its tendency is to distract and divide the Whigs, 
for it is not to be believed that the other party, to any consider 
</p><p>
able extent, will unite with the Native American. The othei 
party has profited too largely by the foreign vote to authorize us 
to expect that, as a party, it will give any considerable support 
or countenance to the Native Americans. If any modification 
of the naturalization laws shall ever be effected, it will not be at 
the instance, or by the co-operation, of the Democratic party. 
</p><p>
The political evils which flow from the foreign population are 
confined to localities, and do not pervade the interior of the 
Union. Hence I suppose that the principles of the Native 
American party alone can never form a basis of a party commensurate with the whole Union. 
</p><p>
I unite with you in congratulations on the recent signal triumphs of the Whigs. They encourage us to hope for a better 
administration of the general Government. Such a desirable 
result I think inevitable, if the Whigs should be wise, and not 
allow themselves to be intoxicated by their present successes. I 
look on passing scenes with calmness, though not with indifference. I am often addressed to know if I would consent to the 
use of my name again as a candidate for the Presidency. Although fidl of gratitude to my friends for their past confidence 
and support, I have deemed it most befitting to remain silent on 
these appeals, answering neither yea nor nay. In my opinion, 
it is too soon now to agitate the question of the next Presidency. 
The public mind, I think, had better be left to the full, undisturbed, and undivided consideration of the disastrous measures 
of the last session of Congress. It will be time enough hereafter, 
from among the living and the worthy, to select a suitable person to accomplish the changes so desirable in the general administration. 
</p><p>
For the continuance of your kind and friendly feelings and 
sentiments toward me, I beg you to be assured of the thanks and 
gratitude of your friend and obedient servant.

 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, May 12,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, I duly received your letter of the 3d instant, 
and thank you for the friendly expression of your regret and 
sympathy, on account of the great and irreparable loss which I 
have sustained, in the death of my beloved son, on the bloody 
field of Buena Vista. It has been one of the most lamentable 
events of my life, which has been full of domestic afflictions. 
Although I feel some consolation in the gallant manner of my 
son's death in the service of his country, and in the general sympathy which the public has so generously displayed on account 
of it, the deep wound which I have received can only be effectually healed by Him whose dispensations have produced it. 
</p><p>
I approach, at this time, the other subject of your letter under 
feelings which would not allow me to touch it, but at the instance of such a long, tried, and faithful friend, as I have ever 
found you to be. 
 
And first, as to the movement in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to bring out 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> as the Whig candidate for President, which you 
say is represented to have been made by my advice, and with 
my approbation. So far from that being the fact, it took me 
completely by surprise ; and most certainly I neither did, nor is 
it probable that, at any time, I could advise or approve such a 
movement. Now, it appears to me to be premature, impulsive, 
and if generally concurred in by the Whig party, must place it 
in a false and inconsistent position. 
</p><p>
I have thought that any serious movement, earlier than next 
winter or next spring, to designate the Whig candidate, would 
be unwise. By that time we shall have a pretty correct view 
of the whole ground, and of what the Whigs may be able to 
accomplish in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a>. 
</p><p>
The war with Mexico is yet in progress. We do not certainly 
know how it will terminate, nor how <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> himself 
may finally come out of it. In the mean time, it would be very 
embarrassing to him to be a recognized candidate for the Presidency in opposition to the very party, to the orders of whose 
Administration he is subject. 
</p><p>
Then there is <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>. Perhaps, while I am now writing, he is in possession of the city of Mexico. Will he create no 
competition with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a>? May we not have two Whig 
generals in the field of politics? And as the other party may 
desire the eclat of military deeds, may they not bring forward 
some third general. 
</p><p>
As to the inconsistency to which I have referred, it seems to 
me that the Whig party has been long and deliberately committed against the election of a military ofiicer to the Presidency 
who had never developed any capacity for civil administration. 
The election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">General Harrison</a> was no departure from that 
rule ; for he was quite as much distinguished in various walks in 
civil life as he was in his military career. The true principle, I 
think, is this : that great military attainments and triumphs do 
not qualify of themselves nor disqualify for the Presidency. 
</p><p>
If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a>, who is absolutely without any experience 
whatever in civil administration, shall be elected, I think we may 
bid adieu to the election ever again of any man to the office of 
Chief Magistrate who is not taken from the army. Both parties 
will stand committed to the choice of military men. Each in 
future will seek to bring hhn forward who will be most likely to 
</p><p>
secure the public suffrage. Military chieftain will succeed military chieftain, until at last one will reach the Presidency who, 
more unscrupulous than his predecessors, will put an end to our 
liberties, and establish a throne of military despotism. 
</p><p>
If it were highly probable or certain that we must take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a>, or submit to the continuance in power of the present 
dominant party, that would present a different state of things. 
The question then woidd be between the perpetuation and increase of corruption, leading certainly to the destruction of the 
Government, on the one hand, and the ultimate danger of military despotism, on the other. In such a painful dilemma, it 
might be expedient, as an only resort, to select the General as 
the Whig candidate. But this ought not to be done but upon 
the strongest necessity ; and at this early day no such necessity 
is manifest. On the contrary, there is much reason to hope that 
the Whig party may be able to elect any fair and honorable 
man they may choose to nominate. 
</p><p>
As to myself, after the disastrous termination of the contest 
of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1844">1844</a>, I determined to submit to my fate, and to remain passive, and I have accordingly so remained. I have never stated 
to any mortal whether I would consent or not to the use of my 
name again as a candidate. On that question I have formed no 
positive determination, one way or the other. If God were to 
spare my life and my mind should remain in full vigor ; and if 
there were to be such popular demonstrations of a desire to elect 
me as to leave no doubt of the result, I might consent to my 
name being again used. But the latter condition is not likely 
perhaps, to occur, if the former should exist. Up to the battle 
of Buena Vista, I had reason to believe that there existed a fixed 
determination with the mass of the Whig party, throughout the 
United States, to bring me forward again. I believe that the 
greater portion of that mass still cling to that wish, and that the 
movements we have seen, in behalf of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a>, are to a 
considerable extent superficial and limited. Such is the fact m 
this quarter. And even in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> I have been informed 
that by far the greatest enthusiasm was displayed, at the public 
meeting, when some allusion was made to my name. 
</p><p>
If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> is successful to the extent, which we may anticipate, in Mexico, most probably a party will spring up to 
bring him forward ; and in the collisions which may arise, it is possible that the Whig public may deem it wise and expedient finally to put aside both Generals, and select some civilian. 
</p><p>
I am afraid that you will find this long letter a great infliction; but you must attribute it to yourself, and to the confidence and friendship which I entertain for you. 
</p><p>
P. S. I ought to say that I have long and intimately known <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> ; and that I regard him as an honest straightforward man ; but I know nothing of his opinions upon public affairs, except by inference from the fact of his preference of me to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague met">Mr. Polk</a>.

</p><p>
My dear Miss Towler, I called this morning at Mr. McGowans' in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, to see you, but you had departed for 
Columbia. My object was to present to you in person, what I 
now communicate in writing, my cordial thanks for the beautiful lines which you cordially addressed to me, on the death of 
my beloved son. They are highly creditable to your heart and 
to your head. The advice you give to restrain m.y grief for 
that melancholy event, is very good, and certainly the generous 
expressions of such sympathy as you, my other friends, and the 
public have manifested, are calculated to alleviate our sorrows. 
They place me under great and grateful obligations. But He 
only, my young friend, can effectually heal such wounds as we 
have received, by whose inscrutable dispensations they have 
been permitted to be inflicted. You have felt in early life, 
the bereavement of an excellent father. May your surviving 
parent, and your other relatives, be long spared to you, and may 
you enjoy all other earthly blessings. My warm regards to your mother.

[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">MR. CLAY</a>] TO DANIEL ULLMANN. 
</p><p>
Virginia,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=white sulphur springs" rel="city">White Sulphur Springs</a>, August 4,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your friendly letter prior to my departure from home ten days ago, and brought it with me to this 
place. I thank you for the kind tender of your friendly offices, of which, if there should be need, I shall avail myself, with the 
fullest confidence in your fidelity to the Whig cause, and in your personal regard to me. 
</p><p>
I think it even now very manifest that the Locofoco party 
does not intend to make <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> its Presidential candidate ; and if it should not, but should designate some other candidate, the condition of popular unanimity, on which alone he states, in one of his late letters, that he will consent to run, will 
not exist. I think it impossible that the General should maintain silence as to his principles. He must make some public 
avowal of them, in other words he must say whether he is 
Whig or Democrat. Such silence could not, I think, be maintained by General  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, if he were to rise from the dead 
and consented to be again run for the Presidency. General 
Jackson was constrained to proclaim his, although he did not afterward conform to them. 
</p><p>
But suppose him to preserve silence, and the other party to 
designate some other candidate, what then are the Whigs to do? 
Will they not only forego all their objections to a mere military 
man, as President, but take one haphazard, without knowing 
whether he holds a single principle in common with them? 
</p><p>
I have thought for some time, and continue to think, that it is 
highly probable that the other party will finally settle down on 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>, and I think I have seen some indications of this, 
both in its conduct and in his. 
</p><p>
You ask me what is the best mode of conducting the campaign in your State. I should think it best to rely upon the old 
issues, with the exception of that of a Bank of the United 
States, which I believe was never pressed in Pennsylvania. 
There is, 1st. The principle of protection, and the fraud practiced on Pennsylvania by the Kane letter. In further support 
of this fraud I learned yesterday from the Honorable Reverdy 
Johnson, that, during the canvass of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1844">1844</a>, when some interrogatories were addressed from your State to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague met">Mr. Polk</a>, requesting a 
more explicit avowal of his opinion in regard to the Tariff of 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1842">1842</a>, Mr. Buchanan wrote to Tennessee that the Kane letter 
was working well, and begging that those interrogatories might 
not be answered, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague met">Mr. Polk</a> accordingly remained silent. 
</p><p>
Then there is, 2d. The Mexican w^ar, its causes, the manner of 
conducting it, and the great National debt which it fastens on the country. 3d. The alarming increase of the vetos and the 
abuses of the Executive power the improvement of the country, etc., etc. These and other topics will readily present themselves, and will be treated by you to the greatest advantage. 
</p><p>
It is true, as you remark, that the famished condition of Enrope has concealed the effects of the Tariff of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a> ; but these 
v/ill be more and more manifested as bread and other food become there abundant. Already have the prospects of a good 
crop in Europe led to a decline in the prices of American food. 
</p><p>
I shall remain here until Monday next, when I purpose passing through your native State to Cape May, where I desire to 
enjoy a sea-bath, which I never in my life before had an opportunity of doing. You must not, however, infer that my health 
is bad. It is on the contrary very good.

likely to be reached, I fear, for two or three weeks, if it be

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your letter of the 9th instant and I 
was gratified with the proceedings in Bourbon, of which it gave 
a full account. I presume through other channels you are advised of the state of public affairs here. I see no prospect of 
peace at present. Upon my arrival here the strongest appeals 
have been made to me to take no step withdrawing my name 
from among those from which a selection is to be made of a candidate for the Presidency. I have been assured that, if I did, it 
would lead to a prostration of the Whig party, especially in the 
free States. Then they say that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> can not be supported in his present noncommittal position. Some doubt, if he 
were to assume distinct Whig ground, whether he could obtain 
the Whig support. I have suspended any definitive action. 
</p><p>
Great surprise exists here as to the hot haste of our Taylor 
friends in Kentucky. Why is it? I am often asked, without 
being able to give any very satisfactory answer. What will be 
the issue of the two Conventions in Frankfort next week? Nobody knows here. After the long period of time during which 
I have had the happiness to enjoy the friendship and confidence 
of that State, what have I done, it is inquired, to lose it? 
</p><p>
Those Conventions, if they would act wisely, I think, would 
acquiesce in the National Convention and leave their own delegates to act freely, according to all circumstances. 
 
</p><p>
My suit has been argued in the Supreme Court, and I shall 
leave this place next week for  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, where some business takes me.

</p><p>
My dear General, I received your favor this morning. I 
have written this winter no letters to Kentucky on public affairs 
but in answer to letters which I received, and of this description 
only three. That which you thought ought to have been addressed to you was of that character. 
</p><p>
I remain in my passive position in regard to the Presidency. 
To this course I have been strongly urged. It is generally approved. Whether and when I may change it depends on circumstances. There is no occasion for precipitate action. Mine at 
least shall be deliberate ; having due regard to country, party, 
friends. If I were to credit all I hear and see, there would be no 
doubt of my election, if nominated by the National Convention, 
with my consent ; but experience has brought diffidence, and I 
do not lend too ready an ear to even agreeable things. 
</p><p>
I learn from New York that there is not a particle of doubt 
that, if I were a candidate, the vote of that State would be given 
me by an immense majority. The Legislature (I mean the 
Whigs) have had a caucus, in which they passed a resolution, 
with I believe unanimity, designating me, although not naming 
me, and excluding our friend <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a>, though not naming him. Our Kentucky and other friends ought to know what 
an up-hill business that is of supporting the General in the free 
States ; and yet I lose no suitable occasion to impress on all 
union, harmony and concord. 
</p><p>
I am fully convinced that no preference will be expressed next 
week in Virginia, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> ; most probably none will be expressed for any one. 
</p><p>
I expect to be in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> the two or three last days of this 
month and the first week of the next. If I can give any impulse to your business there, I shall not fail to do it.

My dear Sir, I received to-day your favor of the 10th instant. Prior to this you will have received my note addressed to 
the public announcing my assent to the submission of my name 
to the consideration of the National Convention. It so fully explained my views and feelings that I have nothing to add to it. 
I do not see how it is possible for any exception to be taken 
to it. 
</p><p>
I concur with you in regretting the course of the " National Intelligencer" in regard to the French Revolution ,• but I think it 
ought not to operate, and I hope it will not to the prejudice of 
the Whig party. The editors expressly disclaim being the organ of that party, and the resolutions of congratulation to the 
French people have been passed, in both houses of Congress, by 
almost unanimous votes. My own opinion is, that our sympathies and congratulations were due to the French people for the 
Revolution which they had effected. In expressing these sentiments, we should not have been committed to the sanction of any 
future excesses which may be perpetrated in the progress of the 
revolution, if any such should unfortunately occur. My hope is 
that the foreign powers, profiting by the folly of their former interference with France, will abstain from all exterior pressure 
upon her, and that she, profiting by the errors which were committed in the former Revolution, will peacefully establish, without the spilling of blood, a free Government upon the basis of 
popular representation. 
</p><p>
No one can doubt my feelings and sympathies who has any 
recollection of the course which I took in regard to the Spanish 
American Republics, and to Greece. While France has my cordial and hearty wishes for the triumphant establishment of liberty, 
I shall be ready to express the deepest regrets, if the Revolution 
should take an unfortunate turn. 
</p><p>
I request you to present my respectful compliments to Mrs, Haight.

My dear Sir, I received your kind letter of the 19th instant, 
and I feel greatly obliged by the confidence in me which it 
evinces. You desire, in the event of there not being a majority 
of the Whig Convention disposed to nominate me, to know who 
among the distinguished names before the Convention would be 
my first, second and third choice. I have hitherto maintained a 
position of entire impartiality between my competitors for the 
nomination. It was dictated by considerations of delicacy toward them. I do not think that I ought to deviate from it. 
To you, as soon as to any friend I have, I would make the desired communication, if I were not restrained by the motives 
suggested. 
</p><p>
I hope that your apprehensions of a stormy Convention will 
not be realized ; but that it will be found animated by a spirit

Gentlemen, I received your favor adverting to certain reports in circulation in respect to me, with regard to the approaching Presidential election, and requesting information in relation 
to them. 
</p><p>
Recognizing you as among my staunchest, truest, and most faithful friends, I shall ever feel under the greatest obligations to you;

entitled to your esteem if I did not continue to act, as I have

As far as I was personally concerned, I submitted to the decision 
of the late National Convention at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. It has relieved 
me from much painful suspense and anxiety, if I had been nominated ; and from great vexation, care, and responsibility, if I had 
been subsequently elected. I shall do nothing in opposition to 
it. I shall give no countenance or encouragement to any third 
party movements, if any should be attempted against it. I desire to remain henceforward in undisturbed tranquillity and perfect repose. I have been much importuned from various quarters 
to endorse <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> as a good Whig, who will, if elected, 
act on Whig principles and carry out Whig measures. But how 
can I do that? Can I say that in his hands Whig measures will 
be safe and secure, when he refuses to pledge himself to their 
support? when some of his most active friends say they 
are obsolete? when he is presented as a no-party candidate? 
when the Whig Convention at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> refuse to recognize 
or proclaim its attachment to any principles or measures, and actually laid on the table resolutions having that object in view? 
</p><p>
Ought I to come out as a warm and partisan supporter of a 
candidate who, in a reversal of our conditions, announced his 
purpose to remain as a candidate, and consequently to oppose 
me, so far as it depended upon himself? Tell me what reciprocity is in this? Magnanimity is a noble virtue, and I have 
always endeavored to practice it ; but it has its limits, and the 
line of demarcation between it and meanness is not always 
clearly discernible. I have been reminded of the course I pursued in the case of the nomination of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">General Harrison</a> in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1839">1839</a>. 
But <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whh" rel="met colleague">General Harrison</a> was not merely a Whig in name. He 
was committed and pledged to the support of the measures of 
the Whigs. He did not declare that he would stand as a candidate in opposition to the nomination of the Convention. He 
was, moreover, a civilian of varied and extensive experience. 
</p><p>
I lost the nomination, as I firmly believe, by the conduct of 
the majorities in the delegations from Kentucky in Congress and 
Ml the Convention, and I am called upon to ratify what they did, 
in contravention, as I also believe, of the wishes of a large majority of the people of Kentucky ! I am asked to sanction and 
approve the course of the seven delegates from Kentucky, who, 
in violation of the desire of their constituents, voted against me, 
and virtually to censure and condemn the five who voted for 
me ! 
</p><p>
It seems to me, gentlemen, that self-respect, the consistency 
of my character, and my true fame, require that I should take 
no action or partisan agency in the existing contest. If it was 
between Locofoco principles and Whig principles, I would engage in it with all the ardor of which I am capable ; but alas ! 
I fear that the Whig party is dissolved, and that no longer are 
there Whig principles to excite zeal and to stimulate exertion. 
I am compelled, most painfully, to believe that the Whig party 
has been overthrown by a mere personal party, just as much 
having that character as the Jackson party possessed it twenty 
years ago. 
</p><p>
In such a contest I can feel no enthusiasm ; and I am not 
hypocrite enough to affect what I do not feel. There is undoubtedly a choice, but I regard it as a choice of evils, which I 
will make for myself in due time, under the influence of the 
great principles for which I have so long contended. I think 
</p><p>
my friends ought to leave me quiet and undisturbed in my retirement. I have served the country faithfully and to the utmost of my poor ability. If I have not done more, it has not 
been for want of heart or inclination. My race is run. During 
the short time which remains to me in this world, I desire to 
preserve untarnished that character which so many have done 
me the honor to respect and esteem. They may rest assured 
that I will intentionally do nothing to forfeit, or weaken their 
good opinion of me. Abstaining henceforward from all active 
part in public affairs, and occupying myself with my private and 
more solemn duties, I shall, if spared, go to the polls at the 
proper season, like any other private citizen, and cast my vote 
as I may deem best and safest for the principles I have sustained and for my country. Seeking to influence nobody, I 
hope to be permitted to pursue for myself the dictates of my 
own conscience. 
</p><p>
Such is the view which I have of the present posture of the 
Presidential question, and my relations to it. More light may be 
hereafter thrown upon it, which I shall be most happy to receive, 
and if it should point to a different course of duty, I shall not 
hesitate to follow it. 
</p><p>
I address this letter to you in consequence of yours, and from, 
the friendly regard I entertain for you. I should have preferred, 
that you had not thought it necessary to appeal to me. It is, 
manifest from the tenor of my reply that it is not intended for, 
publication. X am, etc.

Dear Sir, I comply so far with the request contained in

to say that, submitting to the decision of the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Convention, so far as I was personally affected by it, I can not give 
my countenance or encouragement to the use of my name in 
connection with the Presidency. Abstaining from the expression of any opinion in regard to the nomination which was actually made, I will only observe that Ohio, Indiana, and Massachusetts, and other Northern States, had it in their power to 
prevent it, if they had chosen to unite upon one whose attachment to the Whig cause was never doubted ; but they did not 
think proper to do so. Ought they then to complain of what 
was done, upon the ground that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> is not pledged

[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">MR. CLAY</a>] TO MISS SUSAN ALLIBONE. 
</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, July 19,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a>. 
</p><p>
If I have not before written to you, my dear Miss Susan, I 
pray you to believe that my silence has not proceeded from any 
want of regard to you or from any insensibility to the kindness 
which you have displayed toward me, in your obliging letter of 
the 4th March last, and in presenting me with the valuable writings of Archbishop Leighton. 
</p><p>
With perfect truth and candor I say that I have rarely ever 
made a visit to any individual in my life that afforded me higher 
satisfaction than that which I derived from seeing you. Your 
physical misfortunes, your resignation to the will of our Maker, 
your gentle and intelligent countenance, and your interesting 
conversation, all combined to give to the short interview I had 
with you a thrilling interest. I have oftentimes thought of it, 
and have frequently described the touching scene to my friends. 
</p><p>
I have looked enough into the volume which you kindly sent 
me to be convinced that it merits your high commendation of 
it ; and I intend to give the whole of it an attentive perusal. 
</p><p>
I am very thankful, dear Miss Susan, for the friendly manner 
in which you allude to the domestic afflictions with which it has 
pleased Providence to visit me. I have had a large share of them. 
Since my return home another has been added to the former 
number in the death of a most promising grandson, at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, under circumstances which greatly aggravated our grief. 
I am happy, however, to tell you, on the other hand, that the 
sweet little granddaughter, whose case of spinal affection I mentioned to you, is much better, runs about with the free use of 
her limbs, and we hope will have her strength and health fully 
re-established. In behalf of her I thank you for the little book 
which you had the goodness to send her. She is yet too young 
to read it herself, but I trust that she will be spared to be able hereafter to peruse it. In the mean time her excellent mother will make her familiar with its contents. 
</p><p>
Relieved as I am now from the cares, the troubles and the responsibilities of public life, I hope to profit by retirement in 
making those preparations for another and better world which 
are enjoined upon us by our highest and eternal interests. In 
these, your example of perfect submission and complete obedience 
will be constantly remembered by me, with great benefit and advantage. Instead of condoling with me, as some of my friends 
have, on account of my failure to obtain the nomination at the 
late  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Convention, their congratulations on the event 
would have been more seasonable and appropriate. 
</p><p>
I request you to present my respectful regards to your brothers and their families ; and accept for yourself my prayers that 
He who has enabled you so calmly and cheerfully to bear up 
under the heavy privations which you suffer, may continue His 
watchful care over you to the end, and that we may both hereafter meet in the regions of eternal bliss.

My dear Sir, I received, at the Estell Springs (from which 
I returned yesterday), your favor transmitting a sketch of Mr. 
's speech at Versailles, for which I thank you. 
</p><p>
How derogatory is it for politicians to attempt to ridicule and 
degrade themselves in the presence of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> ! And 
how inconsistent is it to denounce party in the same breath in 
which the Whig party is called on to support the General as a 
Whig, that is, a party man ! It is mortifying to behold that once 
great party descending from its lofty position of principle, known, 
avowed and proclaimed principle, and lending itself to the creation of a mere personal party, with a virtual abandonment of its 
old principles. 
</p><p>
I have a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> in which he states that he authorized, on his landing from Mexico, a distinguished gentleman from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, to say that he was willing to run as a candidate for the Vice Presidency on the ticket with me.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received, and perused with lively interest and gratitude, your friendly letter of the 27th ultimo. 
</p><p>
The Whig party presents an anomalous condition. Without 
any candidate who recognizes his obligation to conform to their 
principles, the members of it are called upon as a party to support the no-party candidate ; and I have been urgently and repeatedly appealed to, to indorse as a Whig <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a>, who, 
while he adopts the name in a modified form, repudiates the 
principles of the party ! I need not say, that I have done, 
and shall do, no such thing. Self-respect, consistency with deliberate opinions long ago formed, and my sense of public duty, 
will restrain me from taking any prominent or active part in the 
canvass. Whatever I may do, I will not expose myself to any 
reproaches from those if there be any such who might be 
misled by my opinion. I have submitted quietly to the decision of the Convention, and beyond that I feel under no obligations. 
</p><p>
I consider my public career as forever terminated, and I am 
most anxious to preserve untarnished that character, around 
which so many warm-hearted friends have done me the honor 
to rally. I should, I think, justly incur their censure if, after all 
that I have thought and said (confirmed as my convictions are 
by observation) against the elevation of mere military men to 
the Presidency, could I come out in the active support of the 
most exclusively military candidate ever presented to the American people ; one, too, who has forced himself upon the Convention, or been forced upon it. One who declared that he would 
stand as an independent candidate against me, or any other 
Whig that might be nominated a declaration made under his 
own hand, and which remains uncontradicted by any thing 
under his own hand, which the public has been permitted to 
see. 
</p><p>
I do not mean to intimate what may be my final vote, given 
quietly at the polls, if I vote at all ; that will depend upon a 
view of all existing circumstances at the time ; but neither now 
nor then do I desire to influence any body else. 
</p><p>
There is nothing in the contest to arouse my patriotism, or to 
animate my zeal. I regard the attempt to elect General Tayloi 
as one to create a mere personal party. How such a party may 
work, I can not foresee ; possibly better than that of either of 
his competitors ; but this possibility is not sufficient to excite 
any warmth or enthusiasm with me. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> has, I 
think, exhibited much instability and vascillation. He will inevitably fall into the hands of others, who will control his Administration. I know not who they will be, but judging from 
my experience of poor, weak human nature, they will be most 
likely those who will have favored and flattered the most. 
</p><p>
Standing proud and erect in the consciousness of having 
faithfully fulfilled all my public duties, and supported and 
cheered by numberless intelligent and warm-hearted friends in 
all parts of the country, I acquiesce in the retirement in which I 
expect to pass the remnant of my life. Some of those friends 
may censure me for the inaction which I have prescribed to myself during the present canvass ; but if they do, I appeal to 
their " sober second thoughts," or to the impartial tribunal of 
posterity. I am, etc.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your friendly letter, and beg you 
to be perfectly assured of my undiminished regard and esteem. 
</p><p>
Although I believe that the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Convention has 
placed the Whig party in a humiliating condition one which, I 
fear, will impair its usefulness, if not destroy its existence ^I 
acquiesced in its decision in not nominating me, and have submitted quietly to it. I have done nothing to oppose its nomination. I have given no countenance to any movements having 
for their object any further use of my name, in connection with 
the ofiice of President. Beyond this I can not go. Self-respect 
and consistency with deliberate opinions long since formed and 
repeatedly avowed, against the elevation to that office of a mere 
military man, must restrain me from taking any active part in 
the canvass. I wish to leave every body freely to act for themselves, without influence from me, if I could exert any. If I were to recommend the support of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a>, and if he 
should be elected on it afterward, and in his Administration disappoint the Whigs, I should feel myself liable to reproaches. 
</p><p>
I regret, therefore, that I can not comply with your request to 
make a public declaration of my intention to support General 
Taylor. Without compromising any one, I shall go to the polls 
when the day arrives, and give such a vote as I think may be 
most likely to be least injurious to the country. 
</p><p>
With my warm regards to IVIrs. White and your family, I 
am your friend.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 9th instant, informing me of the movement of some of my friends in New 
York to bring out my name as a candidate for the Presidency. 
</p><p>
I feel under the greatest obligations and the warmest gratitude 
to them, for the sentiments of attachment, confidence, and 
friendship which they do me the honor to entertain. And to 
you, in particular, I owe an expression of my cordial thanks for 
your long, ardent, and ever faithful attachment to me. 
</p><p>
But, my dear sir, after the decision of the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Convention against my nomination, I have felt bound quietly to 
submit. I could not, therefore, accept a nomination, if it were 
tendered to me, nor do I wish any further use of my name in 
connection with the office of President. 
</p><p>
I never would have consented to the submission of my name 
to that Convention, but under a conviction that I should have 
been elected if nominated. I firmly believe now that such 
would have been the result. 
</p><p>
The Convention chose to nominate another, and I have ever 
since avoided giving the slightest countenance or encouragement 
to any further efforts on my behalf. 
</p><p>
To bring me into the canvass now, would, I think, only have 
the efiect of adding to existing embarrassments, and perhaps of 
throwing the election into the House of Representatives, at a 
time when parties are most exasperated against each other. 
Such an issue of the contest is to be deprecated. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear that you have finally established yourself 
in your profession in New York. I request you to accept my 
cordial wishes for your success, happiness, and prosperity.

</p><p>
Gentlemen, I have received your official letter as members 
of the (Whig) Democratic General Committee of the city and 
county of New York, and I take pleasure in answering it. 
</p><p>
Never from the period of decision of the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Convention against my nomination as a candidate for the Presidency, 
have I been willing, nor am I now, to have my name associated 
with that office. I would not accept a nomination if it were tendered to me, and it is my unaffected desire that no further use be 
made of my name in connection with that office, I have seen, 
therefore, with regret, movements in various quarters having for 
their object to present me as their candidate to the American 
people ; these movements have been made without any approbation from me. In the present complicated state of the Presidential election they can not, in my opinion, be attended with any 
public good, and may lead to the increase of embarrassments, and 
to the exasperation of parties. 
</p><p>
While I say this much without reserve, I must nevertheless 
add that I feel profound gratitude to such of my warm-hearted 
and faithful friends as continue to indulge the vain hope of placing me in the office of Chief Magistrate of the United States. 
And that I neither think it just or politic to stigmatize them as 
factionists or by any other opprobrious epithets. Among them I 
recognize names which have been long distinguished for ability, 
for devotion to the Whig cause, and for ardent patriotism. 
</p><p>
You advert with entire truth to the zeal and fidelity with 
which the delegation from New York sought in the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
Convention to promote my nomination as a candidate for the 
Presidency. I am most thankful to them and shall ever recollect 
their exertions with profound gratitude. 
</p><p>
And here, gentlemen, I would stop but for your resquest that I 
would communicate my views ; this I shall do briefly and frankly, 
but with reluctance and regret. 
</p><p>
Concurring entirely with you, that the peace, prosperity and happiness of the United States depend materially on the preservation of Whig principles, I should be most happy if I saw more 
clearly than I do that they are likely to prevail. 
</p><p>
But I can not help thinking that the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Convention 
humiliated itself, and as far as it could, placed the Whig party 
in a degraded condition. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> refused to he its candidate. He professed indeed to be a Whig, but he so enveloped 
himself in the drapery of qualifications and conditions that it is 
extremely difficult to discover his real politics. He was and yet 
is willing to receive any and every nomination no matter from 
what quarter it might proceed. In his letter to the " <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> 
Republican" of the 20th April last, he declared his purpose to remain a candidate, no matter what nomination might be made by 
the Whig Convention. I know what was said and done by the 
Louisiana delegation in the Convention, but there is a vail about 
that matter which I have not penetrated. The letter from him 
which it was stated one of that delegation possessed, has never 
been published, and a letter on the same subject addressed to the 
independent party of Maryland, has at his instance been withheld from the public. It was quite natural that after receiving 
the nomination he should approve the means by which he obtained it. What I should be glad to see is some revocation of the 
declaration in the '' <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Republican" letter before the 
nomination was made. 
</p><p>
On the great leading national measures which have so long divided parties, if he has any fixed opinions, they are not publicly 
known. Exclusively a military man, without the least experience in civil affairs, bred up and always living in the camp with 
his sword by his side, and his epaulets on his shoulders, it is 
proposed to transfer him from his actual position of second in 
command of the army, to the Chief Magistrate of this great model 
Republic. 
</p><p>
If I can not come out in active support of such a candidate, I 
hope those who know any thing of my opinions, deliberately 
formed and repeatedly avowed, will excuse me ; to those opinions 
I shall adhere with increased instead of diminished confidence. 
I shall think that my friends ought to be reconciled to the silence 
I have imposed on myself from deference to them as well as 
from strong objections which I entertain to the competitor of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a>. I wish to lead or mislead no one, but to leave 
all to the unbiased dictates of their own judgment. 
 
I know and feel all that can be urged in the actual position of 
the present contest. 
</p><p>
I entertain with you the strongest apprehension from the election of General Cass, but I do not see enough of hope and confidence in that of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> to stimulate my exertions and 
animate my zeal. I deeply fear that his success may lead to the 
formation of a mere personal party. There is a chance indeed 
that he may give the country a better administration of the Executive Government than his competitor would, but it is not such 
a chance as can arouse my enthusiasm or induce me to assume 
the responsibility of recommending any course or offering any 
advice to others. 
</p><p>
I have great pleasure in bearing my humble testimony in favor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mif" rel="colleague met">Mr. Fillmore</a>. I believe him to be able, indefatigable, industrious and patriotic. He served in the extra session of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1841">1841</a> 
as Chairman of the committees of the two houses of Congress, 
and I had many opportunities of witnessing his rare merits. 
</p><p>
I do not desire the publication of this letter, but if you deem 
it necessary, you may publish the four first and the last paragraphs.

My dear Son, I received your letter of the 27th November, 
and I was happy to hear of the continued health of Susan and 
your children, and especially that she had so easy an accouchement. That was the result of her previous exercise and the climate of Lisbon. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to hear of the bad prospect of your getting our 
claims satisfied. I wrote you a few days ago, giving a long account of an interview which I had with the Portuguese minister, etc., about the case of the General Armstrong. In the course 
of it, he told me that he thought some of our claims were just, 
and so did the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and that they would 
be paid. If we are to come to any appeal to force, perhaps it 
will be as well that they should reject them all, those which are 
clearly just as well as those which are contestable. But, as it 
would be a feather in your cap, I should like that you would 
get them all owned, or as many as you can. 
</p><p>
The minister told me that the owners of the General Armstrong demanded $250,000. That sum strikes me to be erroneous. If they agree to admit the claim, you might stipulate to 
have the amount fixed by some commission ; or, which would 
be better, if the owners have an agent at Lisbon, 5'"ou might get 
him to fix the very lowest sum which they would be willing to 
receive, which might not exceed one fifth of the sum demanded. 
</p><p>
I mentioned confidentially to Sir H. Bulwer, the British minister, my apprehensions of a difficulty with Portugal, and he 
said he would write to Lord Palmerston, and suggest to him to 
interpose his good offices, etc. He told me that a brother of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=geh" rel="colleague met">Lord Morpeth</a> was the British Charge at Portugal. If he resembles his brother, you will find him a clever fellow. 
</p><p>
No certain developments are yet made of what Congress may 
do on the subject of slavery. I think there is a considerable 
majority in the House, and probably one in the Senate, in favor 
of the Wilmot proviso. I have been thinking much of proposing some comprehensive scheme of settling amicably the whole 
question, in all its bearings ; but I have not yet positively determined to do so. Meantime some of the Hotspm-s of the 
South are openly declaring themselves for a dissolution of the Union, if the Wilmot proviso be adopted. This sentiment of 
disunion is more extensive than T had hoped, but I do not regard it as yet alarming. It does not reach many of the Slave States. 
</p><p>
You complain of not hearing from Kentucky. I have the 
same complaint. I have not received a letter from John for a 
long time. My last was from Thomas, of the 18th ult. They 
were then all well. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear that Henry is placed at school, but am sorry 
that his defects continue to display themselves. We must hope 
that he will correct them as he grows older, and in the mean 
time console ourselves that his faults are not worse than they 
are.

My love to Susan, the boys, and your children.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I met with an accidental but violent fall a 
week ago, in carelessly descending a flight of stairs, to receive a 
gentleman who bore me a letter of introduction, and I got terribly bruised. I broke no bones, but it disabled me, for the present, from walking without assistance, and almost from writing. 
</p><p>
I received yesterday your favor of the 12th, and to-day that 
of the 14th. I regret extremely that the use of my name, in 
connection with the office of Senator, should have created any 
division among the Whigs, or excited any dissatisfaction with 
any one. God knows that I have no personal desire to return 
to that body, nor any private or ambitious purposes to promote 
by resuming a seat in it. I expressed to you and to other 
friends, at the period of my departure from home, the exact 
state of my feelings, when I declared that I could not reconcile 
it to my feelings to become a formal or an avowed candidate ; 
and that if the General Assembly had any other person in view, 
I did not wish to interfere with him. I added that, if, nevertheless, the Legislature thought proper to require my services in the 
Senate, deference to their will, a sense of public duty, and the 
hope of doing some good, would prompt me to accept the 
office. 
</p><p>
These views are unchanged. According to them, it follows 
</p><p>
that I have no desire to have my name pressed upon the General 
Assembly, and I hope that it will not be presented, unless it is 
manifestly the free and voluntary wish of a majority of that 
body. It would be a great mortification to me to be thought to 
be solicitous for that office, and to be supposed to be seeking it 
from the reluctant grant of the Legislature. I hope that my 
friends will act in consonance with the state of my feelings, 
and not suffer my name to be used but on the conditions 
which I have stated.

My dear Sir, The breaking out of the cholera here prevented 
my meeting <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> in this city, as had been expected. 
I met him at Baton Rouge, but only long enough to exchange 
friendly salutations, without any opportunity to converse on 
public affairs. 
</p><p>
About a fortnight ago I met with a terrible accidental fall, 
which, although fortunately I broke no bones, has for the present confined me to my lodgings, disabled me from walking, and 
almost from writing. To that cause is owing my not having 
earlier acknowledged the receipt of your friendly letter of the 
25th ultimo. 
</p><p>
I suppose that I shall be elected to the Senate by the General 
Assembly of Kentucky, in which case I shall hardly feel myself at liberty to decline, confen-ed as the office will be without 
any solicitation from me, without my being a candidate, and 
with the knowledge of a strong disinclination on my part to return to that body. Deference to the will of the General Assembly, a sense of duty, and the possibility of my being able to do 
some good, overcome my repugnance. If I go to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, 
it will be with an anxious desire that I shall be able to support 
the measures of the new Administration, in consequence of their 
conformity with Whig policy. 
</p><p>
There seems to be yet some slight prospect of a settlement at 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> of the Free Soil question ; but we shall see.

The cholera has nearly entirely disappeared from this city.

My dear Son, I was glad to hear by your letter of the 18th 
ultimo that you had returned from Missouri. Your journey 
must have been a dreadful one, but you will find some compensation for it in the profits which you expect to realize. 
</p><p>
My health is better, and I can again walk. I hope to reach 
home toward the last of this month. The weather is now fine 
here, and I am desirous not to return until the winter breaks. 
</p><p>
I have heard that Colonel Allen has discontinued his school,

I declined going to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> at the Call Session.

As you were absent, I sent to Richard Pendell a letter on the

myself, and to posterity.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, I received your last letter, transmitting one 
which is returned. Many thanks are due to you for various 
communications received during the past winter, and which a±forded me much valuable information, I should have before acknowledged them, but for the consequences of my fall, which 
for a time disabled me from both walking and writing. 
</p><p>
The project of assuming the debt of Texas on the consideration of her relinquishment of her territorial claim beyond the 
Nueces, is worthy of serious examination. The difficulty in the 
way will be the Free Soil question. 
</p><p>
I am most anxious that you should obtain some good appointment under the present Administration. You, I think, eminently 
deserve it. Whether I can aid you or not, I can not at present 
say. My relations to the President, on my part, and, as far as I know, on his, are amicable ; but I have had no proof of any 
desire to confer or consult with me on any subject. Some of 
his warm and confidential friends, I have reason to know, view 
me with jealousy, if not enmity. While self-respect will restrain 
me from volunteering any opinion or advice, unless I know it 
will be acceptable, public duty will equally restrain me from offering any opposition to the course of his Administration, if, as 
I hope and anticipate, it should be conducted on principles which 
we have so long cherished and adhered to. 
</p><p>
I hope to reach home, and to see you in all this month, when 
there will be time enough to talk over all these and other 
matters. 
</p><p>
I did not go to the Call Session, because, supposing that it 
would be short and formal, and without any serious division, I 
disliked encountering, in my lame condition, a journey so long 
in the winter. I am, etc.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 3d instant. I 
concluded not to attend the Call Session, which I could not 
have done without much personal discomfort. 
</p><p>
The Cabinet of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a> was not, it seems, exactly as 
you supposed. Some of the appointments excited surprise. I 
think that he might have made one of greater strength. I am 
truly concerned that Letcher was overlooked. I had strong 
hopes that he would have been appointed, and I thought I had 
reason for them. 
</p><p>
I think it quite likely that you may be right in supposing that 
neither I nor my friends will find much favor at Court. As to 
myself, having given no just cause for its frowns, I can bear 
them without difficulty ; but the President will be unwise if he 
neglects or proscribes my friends. Without them, he never 
could have been elected. 
</p><p>
While I have no desu'e to go into the Convention, I shall 
make no decision until my return. I leave this city on the 17th 
instant, and stopping on the river at one or two places, I hope to 
reach home about the last of the month.

</p><p>
I am very grateful and thankful for the friendly sentiments 
toward me which your partiality has prompted you to express. 
You do me too much honor in instituting any comparison between me and the renowned men of antiquity. I am in one 
respect better off than Moses. He died in sight of, without 
reaching, the promised land. I occupy as good a farm as any 
that he would have found, if he had reached it ; and it has been 
acquired, not by hereditary descent, but by my own labor. 
</p><p>
As to public honors and public ofilces, I have perhaps had 
more than my share of them. At all events I am contented, and 
now seek for better, if not higher offices and honors, in a better 
world. That we may both meet there, if we never do here, is 
the sincere prayer of your friend and obedient servant.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favors of the 1st and 4th instant. I regret extremely that many of the appointments of the 
Executive are so unsatisfactory to the public ; and still more that 
there should be just occasion for it. I fear that the President 
confides that matter too much to the Secretaries, and that they 
have selfish and ulterior views in the selections which they make. 
It is undeniable that the public patronage has been too exclusively confined to the original supporters of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="friend met">General Taylor</a>, without sufficient regard to the merits and just claims of the great 
body of the Whig party. This is both wrong and impolitic. 
</p><p>
You tell me that it will be difficult to repress an expression of 
the Whig dissatisfaction, prior to the meeting of Congress. I 
should be very sorry if this was done so early, if it should become necessary (I hope it may not) to do it at all. I think there 
ought not to be any denunciation of the Administration, unless 
it is rendered proper for its plans of public policy. If before 
these are developed, the Administration should be arraigned, it 
</p><p>
would be ascribed to disappointment as to the distribution of the 
patronage of Government. It will be different, if, contrary to 
what we have a right to hope and expect, the Administration 
should fail to support and recommend the great measures of the 
Whig party. 
</p><p>
As to myself, I need not say to you, that I shall go to Washmgton, if I am spared, with a firm determination to oppose or 
support measures according to my deliberate sense of their eflfects 
upon the interests of our country.

My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, I returned home this day fortnight, in improved health, which, with the exception of my cough, continues good. Levi again left me at Buffalo, and has again returned 
to Louisville, on his way home, having reported himself there 
to Mr. Smith. 
</p><p>
I received your letter dated at sea, after you had been two 
days out, and I was sorry to learn that there was so much seasickness in your party. I calculated that you arrived at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=liverpool" rel="city">Liverpool</a> about the time I got home. I found all well here. 
</p><p>
Colonel Brand died with cholera about four weeks ago. Johnson, the saddler, has purchased at private sale the whole of Mr. 
Hunt's land, of upward of eleven hundred acres, at sixty dollars per acre. I think it would have commanded more at public 
auction, land being on the rise. 
</p><p>
You will have seen that Secretary Clayton has got into a 
difficulty with the French minister. I am sorry for it, and I 
think that with judgment and discretion it might have been 
avoided. But your course should be to defend the act of the 
Executive, if you can conscientiously ; and if not to remain silent. The papers will also inform you that the Secretary has also 
a difficulty with the British Charge about the Mosquito Coast. I 
hope it is not so serious as to threaten war. 
</p><p>
My crops of hemp and corn are uncommonly fine, and the 
influx of gold from California, and the general prosperity of the 
country are giving an upward tendency to prices. Hemp, I fear, 
will, however, be an exception next year, owing to its abundance.

I suppose you will hear from Louisville. I have heard nothing to the contrary, and therefore presume all are well there.

My dear Sir, I saw in "The Commonwealth" with sorrow

tender to you, on the melancholy occasion, an expression of my 
sincere sympathy and condolence. I knew enough of him, from 
frequent interviews and conversations with him, to appreciate the 
great distress which the lamented event must have brought upon 
you and Mrs. Harlan and your other children. I have been, in 
my time, a great sufferer from the loss of beloved children, and 
I can fully estimate the grief which you nov/ feel.

Time, and a patient resignation and submission to the will of

</p><p>
The elections in Ohio and Pennsylvania have gone against the 
Administration, and, judging from present prospects, I do not see

how it is to be sustained. If, therefore, you do not come home

My dear Son, I left home the first of last month, which 
throughout was a most delightful one, and, after passing two or 
three weeks in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, New York, and  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, arrived 
here last Saturday, the 1st instant. My presence in those cities 
excited the usual enthusiasm among my friends, and the customary fatigue, etc., to myself; but I rejoice that my health is 
good, with the exception of a bad cold, which I hope is passing 
off. I have not yet seen the President, although I called yesterday and left my card. I have seen Mr. Ewing, and other members of the Cabinet have left their cards. Up to this time there 
is no organization of the House, which is in a very curious state. 
Neither party has a majority, and divisions exist in each ; so that 
no one can foresee the final issue. The elections this year have 
gone very unfavorably to the Whigs, and without some favorable 
turn in public affairs in their favor, they must lose the ascendency. 
</p><p>
I received Susan's letter of the 19th October and yours of the 5th November, and the perusal of them afforded me satisfaction. 
I observe what you say about Mr. Hopkins' kind treatment of 
you. He has gone home, but if I should ever see him, I will 
manifest to him my sense of his friendly disposition toward you. 
I am acquainted with him as a former member of the House of 
Representatives. I shall seize some suitable occasion to examine 
your dispatches at the Department of State, and I am glad that 
you entertain confidence in your competency to discharge the 
duties of your official position. That is a very proper feeling, 
within legitimate bounds ; but it should not lead to any relaxation of exertions to obtain all information within your reach, and 
to qualify yourself by all means in your power to fulfill all your 
official obligations. How do you get along without a knowledge 
of the French language? Are you acquiring it? 
</p><p>
I have heard from home frequently since I left it. John had 
taken a short hunt in the mountains, but returned without much 
success. Thomas had gone down the Ohio to see about the 
saw mill, and is still there. All were well. Dr. Jacobs is now 
here from Louisville. His brother with his wife have gone to 
Missouri, where he has purchased another farm. You have said 
nothing, nor did Susan, about Henry Clay or Thomas Jacobs. 
</p><p>
Give my love to Susan and all your children, and to the boys. 
I will write to her as soon as I am a little relieved from company, etc. 
</p><p>
I hope you will adhere to your good resolution of living within your salary. From what you state about your large establishment, I am afraid that you will exceed that prudent limit. How 
did your predecessor in that particular? I believe he was not a 
man of any wealth.

My dear Susan, I received and read with great pleasure 
your letter of the 19th of October. All its details of information were agreeable to me, and I hope you will continue to write 
to me and to communicate every thing, the minutest circumstance concerning yourself or your dear family. I have taken 
apartments at the National Hotel (a parlor and bed-room adjoining), for the winter. I have an excellent valet, a freeman, and 
I am as comfortable as I can be. No advance has been yet made 
in Congress, in the public business, owing to the House, from 
its divided condition, being yet unable to elect a Speaker. 
When that will be done is uncertain ; but I suppose from the 
absolute necessity of the case there will be, before long, one 
chosen. 
</p><p>
I have been treated with much consideration by the President 
and most of his Cabinet ; but I have had yet no very confidential intercourse with the President. I dined with him this week, 
and I have been invited to dine with two members of the Cabinet, but declined on account of a very bad cold. Mr. Clayton 
sent me <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>' diplomatic note to the Portuguese minister on 
the case of the General Armstrong, with the inclosed note from 
himself. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>' note has been well spoken of by the Attorney General to me, and I think it creditable. There are some clerical inaccuracies in it, which ought to be avoided in future copies 
of his official notes. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a> might have added, in respect to the 
practice of impressment, that " the Portuguese Secretary, in volunteering a sanction of it, has extended the British claim, now 
become obsolete, beyond any limit to which it was ever asserted 
by Great Britain herself, she never having pretended that she 
could exercise the practice within the Territorial jurisdiction of 
a third or neutral power, or any where but on the high seas or 
in her own ports." 
</p><p>
I understood from Clayton that it was intended by the President to submit to Congress the conduct of the Portuguese Government, without recommending, at present, any measure of 
coercion. It is desirable to get the answer to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>' note, as 
soon as practicable, if one be returned. 
</p><p>
I have heard from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a> as late as the 10th instant. All the whites were well ; but there had been a number of cases of small-pox in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, and one of our black men had caught it, but he was getting well. Think of your present enjoyment of a delightful climate and tropical fruits, when there fell at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> on the 10th instant, a snow six or eight inches deep! Your brother, the Doctor, has returned to Louisville. You said nothing in your letter to me about Thomas, Henry Clay, or my dear Lucy, and your other children. Is Henry going to school and where? 
 
I believe T did not mention in my former letters to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a> that Lucretia Erwin has determined to take the black vail. 
</p><p>
I send herewith a letter from Mary Ann's husband. My love to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a> and to all the family.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 17th instant, and 
thank you for its details. It seems that I have lost my negro 
man by the small-pox. I hope the measures taken will arrest 
its progress. 
</p><p>
My object in writing you now is one of great importance, 
and I wish you to lead off in it. It will do the country good, 
and do you good. 
</p><p>
The feeling for disunion among some intemperate Southern 
politicians, is stronger than I hoped or supposed it could be. 
The masses generally, even at the South, are, I believe, yet 
sound ; but they may become influenced and perverted. The 
best counter-action of that feeling is to be derived from popular 
expressions of public meetings of the people. Now, what I 
should be glad to see, is such meetings held throughout Kentucky ; for, you must know, that the disunionists count upon 
the co-operation of our patriotic State. Can't you get up a 
large powerful meeting of both parties, if possible, at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, at Louisville, etc., to express, in strong language, their determination to stand by the Union? I hope the Legislature, 
and the Convention also, if it has not adjourned, may do the 
same. If you remain silent and passive, there is danger that 
the bad feeling may yet reach you. Nov/ is the time for salutary action, and you are the man to act. I inclose some resolutions, which, or some similar to them, I should be happy to see 
adopted. 
</p><p>
Prudence and propriety will suggest to you, that too free a use 
of my name should not be made in getting up this movement. 
You well know the persons to consult with ; and I wish you 
would keep me advised of what you do.

Mr DEAR Thomas, I received a letter from you while you 
were with Henry Wilkins, at your saw-mill, but none since. I 
expected to have heard of your return home, and to have gotten 
a letter from you, ere now ; but T suppose that you have been 
detained below longer than you expected. I shall be glad to 
hear from you, the prospects of your mill, etc.

I am afraid that your mother and John have had much trouble 
and anxiety at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>. The loss of my man by the small-pox, 
and the fear of its spreading must have given them much uneasiness. It has become necessary to purchase or hire two additional hands for the farm. I should prefer the latter, and I have 
so written to John. I wish you would give him all the assistance you can in procuring them. His mill, too, has got out of 
order ; but I hope that he has been able to get a millwright to 
repair.

My dear Wife, There is a bundle of papers in my office up

one from him to me, dated at Monterey, in Mexico, I think, in

I am still staying at the National Hotel, where I have a good 
parlor and bed-room, for which and my board I pay thirty dollars

I yesterday dined with him. He has his wife with him, a niece 
of the Duke of Wellington, a plain, but sensible person.

I have dined with the President, but declined to dine with 
Clayton and Reverdy Johnson, on account of a bad cold. These

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, December 29,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, I received your letter, communicating an 
account of Susan's confinement, and I was delighted to hear that 
she had given birth to a son, with so little of pain and suffering. 
I hope that she has continued to do well, and that the newcomer 
has also been hearty. In the fine climate where you are, I trust 
that all your family enjoy good health. 
</p><p>
I hear from home, but not as often as I could wish. 
</p><p>
After three weeks, Mr. Cobb, of Georgia, a Democrat, was 
elected Speaker, and it was so much more important that the 
House should be organized than that whether Whig or Democrat 
should be chosen, that I was glad an election was made. Nothing of importance has yet been done in Congress. 
</p><p>
The Portuguese Minister called on me to-day, and I had a 
long, long interview with him, both on matters personally relating to you, and on public affairs, the latter, of course, confidentially. 
</p><p>
He tells me that you have a fine house and a delightful situation on the Tagus, with a beautiful prospect, etc., but that they 
made you pay too much rent for it. 
</p><p>
I endeavored to impress him very seriously about our claims 
on Portugal, and that their rejection might lead to very grave 
consequences. I authorized him to communicate what I said to 
him to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He read to me a very 
ingenious and plausible argument in the case of the General 
Armstrong, but I told him that I thought it only ingenious and 
plausible, and that I thought the American claim was well 
founded. One of his points was that the General Armstrong 
began the conflict. To which I replied that the British boats 
approached the Armstrong in hostile array ; and that, when hailed, 
refusing to avow whether their purposes were amicable or hostile, 
the Armstrong was not bound to wait until they struck the first 
blow, but, being authorized to conclude that their purpose was 
to board and capture her, she had a right to defend herself, and 
</p><p>
anticipate the fall of the blow. Exactly as, when an assault is 
made on a man, not yet followed by a battery, he is not bound 
to await the battery, but may defend himself forthwith. 
</p><p>
As to the weakness of Portugal, since the treaty of Methuen, 
she has been an ally, and somewhat dependent on Great Britain. 
Her feelings and sympathies were with the British, and against 
the Armstrong. She not only did not protect the Armstrong, 
which as a neutral power she ought to have done, but she did 
nothing to repel the British violation of her jurisdiction. She 
did worse ; when the crew of the Armstrong was brought on 
shore, she (Portugal) suffered and connived at their being mustered by, or in presence of, British officers, that they might select 
from the array those whom they chose to consider British seamen ! Never was such an indignity before offered ! Never 
before or since did Great Britain ever attempt to exercise her 
pretended right of impressment within the jurisdictional limits 
of a neutral or third power, or any where but in her own ports, 
or on the high seas. 
</p><p>
The Portuguese Minister cited certain provisions of our treaty 
with Great Britain of 1794, and other treaties, making provision 
for the case of captures within the waters of the respective parties 
by a belligerent of either of them, etc. To all which I replied, 
that those treaties took the case from without the operation of 
the general public law, but did not affect the condition of powers 
(of which Portugal was one) having no such treaties with us ; 
that as to these powers, the national law furnished the rule ; and 
that, in cases like the Armstrong, that rule required either protection or indemnity. Protection had not been afforded, and 
indemnity was therefore justly due. 
</p><p>
My manner was intentionally very earnest ; and I sought to 
impress the Minister with the belief I entertain, that if satisfaction of our claims be withheld, it will be sought for by coercion. And I told him that I should be grieved if we had any 
war with Portugal, especially when my son was the accredited 
representative of the United States at Lisbon. I told him that I 
hoped he would impress his Government with the gravity of 
existing circumstances. He was hurt at the reference in the 
President's Message to this affair ; but I informed him that I had 
reason to believe that, at one time, it was contemplated to refer 
to it much more seriously, and I supposed this had not been done 
in consequence of a hope entertained that your dispatches might soon bring the welcome intelligence that our claims had been 
admitted and provided for. 
</p><p>
He spoke of a proposition before the Portuguese Cortes to 
elevate the grade of the mission to this country. I told him that 
the adjustment of our claims would be an agreeable, if not indispensable preliminary to a similar elevation of the rank of our 
Minister to Portugal, etc. 
</p><p>
I presume that they will send you, from the Department of 
State, the President's Message, and all other public documents. 
</p><p>
My love to Susan, to dear little Lucy, and all your children, 
and to H. Clay, and Thomas.

My dear Thomas, I received your favor of the 2d instant, 
and I was glad to learn from it that you had placed your pecuniary affairs on a satisfactory footing ; but I hope that you had 
not agreed to pay to Mr. Hart exorbitant interest. You tell me 
that, not wanting the check I sent you for $450, you handed it 
to R. Pindell to deposit the amount to my credit with the B. 
Bank. I wish you would see that it is done, and let me know 
the fact. 
</p><p>
I am greatly concerned about your poor mother. I am afraid 
that she has too much suffering and trouble for one person to 
bear. John promised me to do all in his power to promote her 
comfort and happiness. I wish you and Mary would do all in 
your power to lighten her burdens as much as possible. I do 
not think that I will leave her again another winter. 
</p><p>
I wrote yesterday to John to send our mules to Greensboro', in 
Georgia, where I have a prospect of a good sale of them. Indeed, I consider them all already engaged at fair prices. I wish 
you would assist him in getting them off. It would be well to 
have them washed. And I desire the person in whose charge 
they may be placed should inform me, from time to time, as he 
makes progress on the journey. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry that John has so much trouble in hiring slaves. 
You will, of course, continue to assist him ; and I hardly know 
what advice to give from this place. He and you must be the 
best judges, being on the spot. If there be no better alternative, 
I suppose that I shall be obliged to purchase one or two young 
men, if good ones can be bought.

My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 15th, and I previously received other favors. I do not write often, because 
really I have nothing positive to communicate, and I have neither time nor inclination to write merely speculative letters.

Every thing here is uncertain the Slavery question in all its 
bearings, California, New Mexico, Texas, etc. Of course, provision for your debt, and all other debts of Texas, is among the 
uncertain things.

My relation with the President and his Cabinet is amicable,

night, and in the day time both they and I are too much engaged

My dear Sir, If I have not written to you often, it is because of my perpetual involuntary engagements, and because I 
</p><p>
have really nothing to write about of a practical nature, and I 
don't like indulging in speculation. Slavery here is the all-engrossing theme ; and my hopes and my fears alternately prevail 
as to any satisfactory settlement of the vexed question. I have 
been anxiously considering whether any comprehensive plan of 
adjustment can be devised and proposed to adjust satisfactorily 
the distracting question. I shall not, however, offer any scheme 
unless it meets my entire concurrence. 
</p><p>
I do not know whether any thing will be done about the Marshall in Kentucky. All om- Whig delegation concurred in the 
propriety of a change ; but when we came to designate the 
man, there was unfortunately much division. The Executive 
may not, under these circumstances, deem it expedient to remove the present incumbent.

My dear Sir, I received your favor, and I am very glad to

I shall need, therefore, popular support. Large public meetings (one at New York especially), indorsing my plan substantially, would do much good. Perhaps the last of next week or

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 12th inst. I am 
glad to hear of the contemplated popular movement in the city 
of New York, on the subject of the questions concerning 
slavery which are producing so much unhappy division and distraction. It will do much good, if it be large, imposing, and 
be attended without distinction of party. But I must think 
that its beneficial effects will depend much upon its being conducted and regarded as a local and spontaneous assemblage, 
without any ground for the imputation of its being prompted 
from any exterior source. And I therefore think it would be 
best that there should not be any distant intervention from Congress or from any remote quarter. It would indeed be very difficult, putting that consideration aside, to prevail upon members 
of Congress, at the moment of so much interest and excitement, 
to quit Congress and repair to New York to address the meeting. At all events, motives of delicacy and propriety would 
restrain me from addressing any member of Congress to leave 
his official position with such purpose. I should hope that it 
was not necessary, and that gentlemen from New York, the 
fresher from the masses the better, could be induced, from patriotic considerations, to attend and address the meeting. 
</p><p>
My accounts of the reception of my scheme of adjustment 
and accommodation of the slavery questions are encouraging. 
There is some holding back in each quarter, from a purpose of 
not committing itself, until the views of the other are known. 
But, in spite of this reserve, there are outbreaks of approbation 
and sanction of the scheme. And although I can not positively 
say so, I entertain strong hopes that it will furnish the basis of 
concord and a satisfactory accommodation.

</p><p>
My dear Son, I have been so excessively occupied that I 
have written less to you than I wished. Henry Clay came safely 
to me, and I have placed him, for the present, at the Georgetown 
College, where he seems contented. 
</p><p>
Nothing has occurred since I last wrote to you on your Portuguese affairs. And I presume that no communication will be 
made to Congress in respect to them, until we settle, if we ever 
do settle, the Slavery subject. On this subject I made a speech, 
and offered a plan of compromise, of which I send you a copy. 
The speech has produced a powerful and salutary effect in the 
</p><p>
country and in Congress. Whether the plan will be adopted or 
not remains to be seen. I think if any is finally adopted it will 
be substantially mine. 
</p><p>
The Kentucky Legislature has passed moderate resolutions, 
given me no instructions, and refused to be represented in the 
Nashville Convention. All this is well. 
</p><p>
My relations to the Executive are civil but not very cordial or

for the rumors.

All are well at home.

My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, I have just received your favor of the 8th 
ultimo. I suppose that the bad state of things here has prevented Clayton from writing to you, and probably prevented the Executive from calling the particular attention of Congress to Portuguese afiairs. 
</p><p>
You will do well, if any arrangement can be effected of any 
of our claims, to obtain the written concurrence of the agents of 
the claimants, if they have any agents near you. And if none, 
and a real doubt and difficulty occur, not covered by your instructions, you had better take the matter ad referendum to your own Government.

We are still in the woods here, on the Slavery question, and

My information from home is good. All are well there. 
Thomas continues to be encouraged by the prospects of his sawmill, and other prospects. 
</p><p>
Tell Susan that I read her letter with great interest, and I 
have sent it to her mother. Her interview with the Queen, with 
all its attending circumstances, was quite imposing. As her 
health is so good at Lisbon, I do not think that you should be 
in a hurry to return home, although whenever you do come we 
shall be most happy to see you. Henry Clay Jr., remains at the 
Georgetown College. 
</p><p>
I have seen a good deal of Sir Henry Bulwer and his lady, 
both of whom are intelligent and agreeable. He promised me, 
as I believe I informed you, to write to Lord Palmerston on our 
affairs with Portugal. 
</p><p>
Give my love to Susan, to Lucy and all the children. Tell 
Susan that I will write to her when I can.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I have been very thankful to you for the information you have, from time to time, communicated to me 
during the session of Congress. While on the other hand you 
have found me an inattentive correspondent. My apparent neglect proceeded merely from the cause that I had nothing certain 
or definite to communicate. 
</p><p>
The all-engrossing subject of slavery continues to agitate us, 
and to paralyze almost all legislation. My hopes are strong that 
the question will ultimately be amicably adjusted, although when 
or how can not be clearly seen. 
</p><p>
My relations to the Executive are civil but cold. We have 
very little intercourse of any kind. Instead of any disposition to oblige me, I feel that a contrary disposition has been sometimes manifested. In the case of a Marshal for our State, four 
of the Whig members, of which I was one, united from the first 
in recommending Mr. Mitchell. Two others of them (making 
six) informed the Secretary of the Interior that they would be 
satisfied with Mr. Mitchell ; yet Speed vA^as nominated, and his 
nomination is now before the Senate. It was the act of the 
President, against the advice of Ewing. 
</p><p>
I have never before seen such an Administration. There is 
very little co-operation or concord between the two ends of the 
avenue. There is not, I believe, a prominent Whig in either 
House that has any confidential intercourse with the Executive. 
Mr. Seward, it is said, had ; but his late Abohtion speech has, I 
presume, cut him off from any such intercourse, as it has eradicated the respect of almost all men for him. 
</p><p>
I shall continue to act according to my convictions of duty, 
co-operating where I can with the President, and opposing where 
I must. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on your appointment as one of the Revisers.

</p><p>
My dear Son, I was at the Department of State yesterday, 
and some of your last dispatches were shown me, and important 
instructions to you were also read to me. These instructions 
are to be sent to you in duplicate, one copy by the mail, and the 
other copy through Commodore Morgan, who is to proceed to Lisbon in one of the ships of the line, and to deliver to you the copy 
which he bears. He is then to await your orders. It is not understood that you are to act finally on these instructions until 
the arrival of the Commodore, but that you should, in the mean 
time, go on with the negotiation for our claims, and conclude, if 
you can, a convention for their payment. 
</p><p>
This course of proceeding will impose on you a heavy responsibility, and you should act with great care, caution, and discretion. If you could prevail on the Portuguese Government to 
pay a sum in block, or in gross, for the amount and in full satisfaction of all our claims on that Government, it might save its 
honor in contesting the Armstrong case. It might stipulate to pay a specified sum, and leave the distribution of it, among the 
claimants, to our Government. I do not know whether you 
have a knowledge of all the claims and the means of fixing on 
their just amount. I was surprised to hear at the Department 
that it was much greater than I had supposed. I would not 
insist upon extravagant or extreme- allowances. I should think 
that if the owners of the Armstrong got $50,000 they might be 
satisfied. 
</p><p>
If, after the arrival of Commodore Morgan, and after you have 
ascertained that no arrangement of our claims can previously be 
made, the Portuguese Government should persist in refusing to 
do us justice, as I understood the instructions, you are to notify 
that Government of your purpose to leave Lisbon, demand your 
passports, and come away. The Commodore is not to employ 
force, which would be an act of war which the President has 
no power to authorize. 
</p><p>
I suppose that this measure of sending a public vessel into the 
port of Lisbon has been adopted upon your advice, at least in 
part. I hope it may succeed ; but if the Portuguese Government has the promise of British succor, it is not so likely to be 
successful. In the present distracted state of this country, and the 
weak condition of the Administration in Congress, it is much to 
be feared that your departure from Lisbon without the settlement 
of our claims, after the contemplated display of naval force, 
will not be followed up by the employment of the coercion 
which the serious steps you are authorized to take would seem 
to require. Hence the great importance of an amicable settlement if one can be made. And hence also I think our claims 
should be brought down to their minimum amount. 
</p><p>
If your negotiation should finally fail, I suppose that we may 
see you back in the United States before the close of this year. 
</p><p>
My last accounts from home represented all well. Give my love to Susan and the children.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sm, I received your favor of the 15th instant. 
What you have stated, in answer to those who have inquired of 
you, whether under any contingency I would consent to be a 
candidate for the Presidency in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1852">1852</a>, is pretty much what I 
should have said myself, if I said any thing ; but I have great 
repugnance to saying any thing about it. It would be great 
folly in me, at my age, with the uncertainty of life, and with 
a recollection of all the past, to say now that I would, under any 
contingences, be a candidate. I can scarcely conceive any, 
there are none in the range of probability, that would reconcile 
me to the use of my name. I have already publicly declared 
that I entertained no wish or expectation of being a candidate ; 
and I would solemnly proclaim that I never would be, under 
any circumstances whatever, if I did not think that no citizen 
has a right thus absolutely to commit himself. 
</p><p>
We can not yet see clearly how or when our slavery difficulties are to be settled.

</p><p>
My dear Son, I received together, to-day, your two favors 
of the 15th and 28th ultimo. I am obliged to you for the articles you have shipped for your mother and me. I shall give 
directions about the pigs, but I am afraid there will be great 
difficulty in getting them home. You can not ship home any 
Port wine, without paying duties here. It must come back with 
you, and as a part of your luggage it will not be liable to duty. 
I should be glad to get six or eight dozen. 
</p><p>
I have no doubt that you may return at the end of the year, 
if you wish it. Whether you do so or not ought to depend on 
your estimate of what will most conduce to the health and happiness of your family and yourself. I should be sorry if you 
allowed your expenses to exceed your salary. Public functionaries are too apt to think themselves more bound than they really 
are to dispense hospitality. He acts wisest who limits himself 
to his salary. 
</p><p>
My last letter and the dispatches from Government will have 
apprized you that a display of naval force is to be tried as an 
experiment in aid of your negotiations. If it fail to induce the 
Portuguese Government to pay our claims, you may have to return even sooner than you wish. I suppose it will not reach 
the port of Lisbon before May. 
 
The Senate confirmed your nomination to-day as soon as it 
was taken up, and without any opposition. At no time was 
there danger of any. 
</p><p>
I wish you were honorably and safely through your negotiations. The employment of a naval force imposes on you a delicate and heavy responsibility, of the success of which I am 
more anxious because I understand you advised it. You may 
be officially interrogated as to the object of the presence of such 
a force. In that case, you will pursue your instructions, and I 
suppose have to say that the ship is intended to take you away, 
if our claims are not adjusted. Commodore Morgan is a particular friend of mine and a very clever fellow. You may tell 
him all about Yorkshire, his pet, etc. 
</p><p>
I have got through the winter better than I expected, but I 
find the colds of this month very bad. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear that you are on good terms with the Foreign Minister. Certainly it would be a good arrangement to 
get them to recognize the justice of the Armstrong claim and 
leave the amount to arbitration ; but that they won't agree to. 
</p><p>
Give my love to Susan, dear Lucy, and your other children. All well at home when I last heard. 
</p><p>
I believe I mentioned the death of your uncle Porter in Arkansas, in February.

</p><p>
My dear Son, I have written to you less of late than I wished, owing to my perpetual public occupations. We are yet in the 
midst of our slavery discussions, with no certainty of the final result. I have hopes of the final success of the compromise reported by me of the Committee of Thirteen, but with less confidence than I desire. 
</p><p>
By this time, I presume that your public duties at Lisbon are 
brought to an unsuccessful close. I fear that the display of force 
in the port of Lisbon has not been attended with the benefit 
anticipated from it. 
</p><p>
I have got Henry Clay admitted as a cadet in West Point, 
and he has gone home to see his relations, and to return to me 
next week to enter the Academy. 
</p><p>
You will see in the papers that I have spoken a great deal 
(much more than I wished) in the Senate. In my last speech I 
had to attack the plan of the Administration, for compromising 
our slavery difficulties ; its course left me no other alternative. 
My friends speak in terms of extravagant praise of my speeches, 
and especially of the last. 
</p><p>
Since I began this letter, I received your letter of the 28th 
April, with Susan's long and interesting letter to her mother, 
which I have read and forwarded this moment. 
</p><p>
I do not entertain much hope of the effect of the display of 
naval force in getting our claims allowed, and consequently I 
expect you will leave Lisbon soon after you receive this letter. 
Should they be allowed, and should Portugal raise the rank of 
her representatives, I suppose the measure would be reciprocated 
by our Executive. 
</p><p>
I am delighted to hear that you are all so happy, and that 
dear Lucy has some good prospect of recovery.

I send a letter from Mary to Susan, and I am to blame for

Pittsburg, that you had reached that city. Not knowing whether 
you will first come here or go to Louisville, I address this

</p><p>
My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jbc" rel="child met">James</a>, Prior to the receipt of your letter, dated at 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a> the 17th instant, I had addressed a letter to you containing some things not necessary to be repeated here. I have not 
yet had a good opportunity of conversing with either the President or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a> about you or your late mission ; but the 
other night at Jenny Lind's concert, sitting by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a>, he 
broke forth in extravagant praises of you. I do not think that 
you ought to put an unfriendly interpretation upon any thing 
which occurred about your return to Lisbon. Your letter from 
Geneva of September did not contain an unconditional offer to 
return. You submitted some point of honor to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a>. I 
think he might have sent earlier instructions to you ; but I suppose his absence from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> and his indisposition formed 
his excuse. In his letter of the 5th November (which I hastily 
read) he seems to have been undecided whether you wished to 
return or not, but left it to you to determine. After you returned 
to the United States I do not think that you ought to have gone 
back to Lisbon for the temporary purpose of concluding the Convention. And, upon the whole, I have no regrets about it, considering how well and how strongly the President speaks of you, 
in his annual Message, and in what favorable terms, officially 
</p><p>
and privately, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=web" rel="colleague met">Mr. Webster</a> speaks of you, and that the public 
ascribes to you the success of the negotiation. I wrote you that 
I think you are entitled to your salary up to the 20th November and a quarter beyond, and to indemnity for any loss in furniture, etc., in consequence of your sudden departure from Lisbon. 
I believe it is usual also to charge for stationery, postage, 
etc. If you will send me your account I will endeavor to have 
it settled. 
</p><p>
I was in hopes that you would stay with your mother until 
my return, and that we would then talk about your future. As 
to your purchase of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, I never desired that you should 
make it, unless prompted by your own interests and feelings. 
When I go hence it must be sold, and I have never feared that it 
would not command a fair and full price. 
</p><p>
I should regret deeply to see you set down doing nothing. 
You must engage in some occupation or you will be miserable. 
The law, farming, or the public service, are the only pursuits 
which I suppose present themselves to you. You don't like the 
first, which is moreover nowhere in Kentucky profitable ; and 
your decision must be between the two others. I had inferred 
that you were tired of diplomacy, unless you could get a higher 
grade than that which you lately held. At present there is none 
that I know of; but perhaps some vacancy may occur. As to 
elevating the mission to Lisbon, I have heard here of no proposal to that effect. It does not depend, you know, exclusively on 
the Executive ; Congress must sanction it. Possibly after the 
conclusion of the Convention, if Portugal should desire to elevate the rank of her minister, it may be proposed to reciprocate 
it by the President ; but I do not apprehend that a higher rank 
would be thought of than that of minister resident. 
</p><p>
You did not say whether you were satisfied or not with my 
sale of your house and lot. I would not have sold it but for 
your great anxiety to sell. It was a good house, but I never 
liked its external appearance. The situation was one of the 
finest in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. 
</p><p>
You will direct what I shall do with the draft for ^3000 when 
I receive it from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>.

My dear Wife, I have finally concluded to return by Cuba, and  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>. The great difficulty I have felt in coming to 
the conclusion has been my long absence from you, and my desire to be with you. But my cough continues ; although I do not 
lay up, my health is bad, and the weather has been the worst of 
March weather. The road, too, by Cumberland, I am told, is almost impassable. I hope that I may be benefited by the softer 
climate of Cuba. I expect to go on the 11th from New York 
in the steamer Georgia. And I think my absence from home 
will not be prolonged beyond a month, that is the middle of 
April, On settling my bank accounts, I will either from here or 
New York make a remittance to you.

I send herewith a check on York for $400 which I have endorsed to you, and of which you will make any use you may

My dear Sir, I received your favor transmitting two letters,

you for the opportunity afforded me of perusing them. 
</p><p>
If the course of affords cause of regret, I am grateful for the firmness and fidelity with which you remained attached

received, and, besides them, the vote of Ohio certainly, and that of Indiana probably. My majority in Pennsylvania would have 
been greater than that which was given to him. But the thing is passed, and no one has more quietly submitted to the event than I have.

</p><p>
My dear Son, I received your letter of the 28th ultimo. 
From Susan I had learned your plans for the future. Although 
they involve a separation of you and your family from me, I can 
not complain of them and think them judicious. I am afraid 
that we did not explain ourselves mutually fully to each other. 
It was my anxious wish that you should have succeeded me in 
the possession of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, if it had suited your inclination and 
interest, and if you had been at home I think we could have 
made some arrangement by which you could have come into the 
immediate possession of it, and I could have taken your house. 
But you were not here ; and before you went to Europe, and in 
your letters from Lisbon, you displayed so much anxiety to sell 
the house that I concluded to take the offer of Mr. Miller. Mr. 
Trotter too was about to give it up, and as I was on the eve of 
my departure for  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and knew of no tenant that I 
could get, I did not well know what to do with it. I think it 
ought to have brought ten thousand dollars, which is what I 
should have been willing to have allowed for it, but I obtained 
the best price I could get, and the sale of it was far better than 
that to Mr. Goodhue which you appeared willing to make. 
</p><p>
My health is not good, a troublesome and inconvenient cough 
has hung by me for six months past ; it has reduced and enfeebled 
me very much. Dr. Dudley thinks that my lungs are unaffected, and that it proceeds from some derangement in the functions 
of the stomach. Be that as it may, I must get rid of the cough 
or it will dispose of me. My hopes rest upon the effects of warm weather. 
 
Susan and the children are well, and appear to be contented 
and satisfied. They are a source of great happiness to me, and 
I look forward to their leaving us with painful anticipations. 
Your mother and John are both quite well, and so are Thomas 
and his family. John is constantly occupied with our numerous 
horses and those which are sent to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>. He is in good 
spirits and appears much encouraged with prospects, and I think 
has reason to be so. My overseer is doing admirably well, and 
your mother is better pleased with him than she ever was with 
any of his predecessors. I have a great many things to say to 
you and to talk to you about, but among the inconveniences of 
my present indisposition, one is, that it is less agreeable to me 
than formerly to write or even to dictate, as I am now doing. I 
must therefore reserve for the occasion of your return to us to 
say whatever I now omit. Susan gets your weekly letters regularly and I hope you will continue to write, as in that way I can 
learn your projects and prospects.

[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">MR. CLAY</a>] TO DANIEL ULLMANN. 
</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, June 14,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1851">1851</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I duly received your favor of the 29th ultimo, 
stating that some of my friends in New York have it under discussion, to make a movement to bring forward my name for the 
Presidency ; and inquiring, in entire confidence, what my own 
views and wishes are, upon the subject. I have delayed transmitting an answer to your letter, from a desire to give to its important contents the fullest and most deliberate consideration. 
That I have now done, and I will communicate the result to you. 
</p><p>
You will recollect that the last time but one that I was in the 
city of New York, I had the pleasure of dining with you and a number of other friends at the house of our friend M ; 
that we then had a frank, full, and confidential conversation on the connection of my name with the next Presidency ; and that 
I then declared that I did not wish ever again to lie brought forward as a candidate. From that declaration, I have never since 
deviated in thought, word, or deed. I have said or done nothing inconsistent with it ; nothing which implied any desire on 
my part to have my name presented as a Presidential candidate. 
On a review and reconsideration of the whole matter, I adhere 
to that declaration. 
</p><p>
Considering my age, the delicate state of my health, the frequency and the unsuccessful presentation of my name on former 
occasions, I feel an unconquerable repugnance to such a use of it 
again. I can not, therefore, consent to it. I have been sometimes tempted publicly to announce that, under no circumstances, 
would I yield my consent to be brought forward as a candidate. 
But I have been restrained from taking that step by two considerations. The first was, that I did not see any such general 
allusion to me, as a suitable person for the office, as to make it 
proper that I should break silence and speak out ; and the second was that I have always thought that no citizen has a right 
to ostracize himself, and to refuse public service under all possible contingencies. 
</p><p>
I might here stop, but I will add some observations on the 
general subject of the next election. I think it quite clear that 
a Democrat will be elected, unless that result shall be prevented 
by divisions in the Democratic party. On .these divisions the 
Whigs might advantageously count, if it were not for those 
which exist in their own party. It is, perhaps, safest to conclude that the divisions existing in the two parties will counterbalance each other. 
</p><p>
Party ties have no doubt been greatly weakened generally, 
and, in particular localities, have been almost entirely destroyed. 
But it would be unwise to suppose that, when the two parties 
shall have brought out their respective candidates, each will not 
rally around its own standard. There may be exceptions ; but 
those, on the one side, will probably be counterpoised by those 
on the other. I believe that no one in the Whig party could 
obtain a greater amount of support from the Democratic party 
than I could ; but in this I may be deceived by the illusions of 
egotism. At all events it would be unsafe and unwise for a candidate of one party to calculate upon any suffrages of the other. 
While I do not think that the hopes of success on the part of 
the Whigs at the next Presidential election are very flattering or 
encouraging, I would not discourage their putting forth their 
most energetic exertions. There are always the chances of the 
war. The other party may commit great blunders, as they did 
recently in your State, in the course of their Senators, who opposed the enlargement of the Erie Canal ; and as they are disposed 
to do in respect to the lake, river, and harbor improvements. 
</p><p>
No candidate, I hope and believe, can be elected who is not 
in favor of the Union, and in favor of the Compromise of the 
last Congress (including the Fugitive Slave bill), as necessary 
means to sustain it. Of the candidates spoken of on the Democratic side, I confess that I should prefer General Cass. He is, 
I think, more to be relied on than any of his competitors. During the trials of the long session of the last Congress, he bore 
himself firmly, consistently, and patriotically. He has quite as 
much ability, quite as much firmness, and, I think, much more 
honesty and sincerity than Mr. Buchanan. 
</p><p>
If I were to offer any advice to my friends, it would be not 
to commit themselves prematurely to either of the two Whig 
candidates who have been prominently put forward. Strong 
objections, although of a very different kind, exist against them 
both. They had better wait. It will be time enough next 
winter to decide ; and I am inclined to believe that both of 
those gentlemen will find, in the sequel, that they have taken, 
or their friends have put them in, the field, too early. 
</p><p>
Besides pre-existing questions, a new one will probably arise 
at the next session of Congress, involving the right of any one 
of the States of the Union, upon its own separate will and 
pleasure, to secede from the residue, and become a distinct and 
independent power. The decision of that momentous question 
can not but exert some influence, more or less, upon the next Presidential election. For my own part, I utterly deny the existence 
of any such right, and I think an attempt to exercise it ought to 
be resisted to the last extremity ; for it is, in part, a question of 
union or no union. 
</p><p>
You inquire if I will visit  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=newport" rel="city">Newport</a> this summer, with the 
view of ascertaining whether it might not be convenient there, 
or at some other Eastern place, to present me a gold medal which 
I understand my good friends are preparing for me. I have 
been absent from home -fifteen out of the last nineteen months, 
and I feel great reluctance to leaving it, dm'ing the present summer. If I were to go to the Eastward, I should have to return 
early in the autumn, and soon after to go back to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, 
unless I resign my seat in the Senate of the United States. Under these circumstances, my present inclination is to remain at 
home and to attend to my private affairs, which need my care. 
</p><p>
Should my friends persevere in their purpose of presenting 
me the proposed medal, some suitable time and place can be 
hereafter designated for that purpose. Surely no man was ever 
blessed with mote ardent and devoted friends than I am, and, 
among them, none are more or perhaps so enthusiastic as those 
in the city of New York. God bless them. I wish it was in 
my power to testify my gratitude to them in full accordance 
with the fervent impulses of my heart.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your friendly letter of the 23d instant. I have been so much from home during the last eighteen 
months that it is not my purpose at present to leave it this summer. 
</p><p>
I have no doubt, with you, that many of the quiet and well disposed citizens of South Carolina are opposed to the measures 
of violence which are threatened by others. But the danger is, 
as history shows too often happens, that the bold, the daring, 
and the violent will get the control, and push their measures to 
a fatal extreme. Should the State resolve to secede, it will present a new form of trial to our system : but I entertain undoubting confidence that it will come out of it with the most triumphant success. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your friendly tender of your services. Should 
any occasion for the use of them arise, I will avail myself of 
them, with great pleasure. 
</p><p>
Do me the favor to present my warm regards to your good 
sister ; and I reciprocate your kind wishes and prayers, with all my heart.

</p><p>
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>, September 26,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1851">1851</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received your favor of the 19th instant, with 
the memorial inclosed. On the subject of the next Presidency, my 
opinions and views have undergone no change since I last wrote 
to you. Should I be able, as I now hope to be, from my slowly improving health, to attend the next session of the Senate, we 
will confer more freely on that subject. In the mean time, I 
am glad that my friends in New York have foreborne to present my name as a candidate. 
</p><p>
I have looked at the list of events and subjects which are proposed to be inscribed on the medal. I have made out and sent 
herewith a more comprehensive list, embracing most of the important matters, as to which I had any agency, during my service in the National councils. As to the Cumberland Road, no 
year can be properly fixed. Appropriations for it were made 
from year to year, for a series of years, which were violently 
opposed, and the support of which chiefly devolved on me. So 
in regard to Spanish America, the first movement was made by 
me in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, and my exertions were continued from year to year, 
until the measure of recognition was finally completed in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1822">1822</a>. 
</p><p>
The list now sent may be too large for inscription on the 
medal. Of course it is my wish that it should be dealt with, by 
abridgment, or omission as may be thought proper. The two 
reports, made by me in the Senate, which gave me much credit 
and reputation were, 1st. That which proposed an equal distribution among the States of the proceeds of the public domain ; 
and 2d. That which averted <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>'s meditated war 
against France, on account of her failure to pay the indemnity. 
I carried both measures against the whole weight of Jackson ; 
but he pocketed the Land Distribution bill, which was not 
finally passed until  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1841">1841</a>. He could not, however, make war 
against France, without the concurrence of Congress, and my 
report preserved the peace of the two countries. 
</p><p>
My Panama instructions were the most elaborate (and if I 
may be allowed to speak of them), the ablest State paper that 
I composed while I was in the Department of State. They 
contain an exposition of liberal principles, regulating Maritime 
War, Neutral Rights, etc., which will command the approbation 
of enlightened men and of posterity. 
</p><p>
I was glad to see that you were nominated for Attorney-General at Syracuse, and I heartily wish for your election. 
</p><p>
The address to me from New York, although published in 
the papers, has not been received officially by me. What is intended? I have had some correspondence about it with- Mr. James D. P. Ogden, who sent me a copy informally. I can not 
venture to encounter the scenes of excitement which would 
attend me, if I were to go to New York ; but in anticipation 
of the reception of the address I have prepared a pretty long 
answer, in which I treat of Secession, the state of the country, 
in regard to the Slavery question, etc. If this answer be capable of doing any good, the sooner it is published the better. 
</p><p>
It is of pure California gold, massive and weighty, and is inclosed in a silver case, which opens with a hinge in the manner 
of a hunting-watch. On the face of the medal is a fine head 
of Mr. Clay, most felicitous in the likeness, and conveying the 
characteristic impression of his features in a higher degree than 
any of the busts or medallions usually seen. The relief is very 
high, and must have required a pressure of immense power to 
give it its fullness, sharpness, and delicacy of outline. The 
reverse exhibits the following inscription :

</p><p>
My DEAR Mary, I received to-day your letter of the 19th 
instant, and I' was very glad to get the details contained in it 
about yourself, your family, and affairs at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a>. And I am 
under very great obligations to you and to Thomas for the kind 
offer which you have made, to come either one or both of you 
to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, to attend me during my present illness. If there were the least occasion for it, I should with pleasure accept the 
offer ; but there is not. Every want, every wish, every attention which I need, is supplied. The hotel at which I stay has 
a bill of fare of some thirty or forty articles every day, from 
which I can select any for which I have a relish, and if I want 
any thing which is not on the bill of fare, it is promptly procured for me. The state of my case may be told in a few 
words. If I can get rid of this distressing cough, or can materially reduce it, I may yet be restored to a comfortable condition. That is the present aim of my physicians, and I have some hope that it has abated a little within the last few days. 
But if the cough can not be stopped or considerably reduced, it 
will go on until it accomplishes its work. When that may be, 
it is impossible to say, with any sort of certainty. I may linger 
for some months, long enough possibly to reach home once 
more. At all events, there is no prospect at present of immediate dissolution. Under these circumstances, I have no desire to 
bring any member of ray family from home, when there is not 
the least necessity for it. With regard to the rumors which 
reach you from time to time, and afflict you, you must bear 
with them, and rest assured of what I have already communicated to your mother, that if my case should take a fatal turn, 
the telegraph shall communicate the fact. I occupy two excellent rooms, the temperature of which is kept up during the day 
at about 70°. The greatest inconvenience I feel is from the 
bad weather, which has confined me nearly a fortnight to my 
room, and I can take no exercise until the weather changes. 
My love to Thomas and all your children, to your mother, and

</p><p>
My dear Thomas, I received two or three letters from you 
since I came here, and should have answered them with pleasure if my strength and health would have admitted of it. You 
observe now I am obliged to employ the pen of a friend, I was 
very thankful for the kind offer of yourself and Mary to come 
here and nurse me. I should have promptly accepted, if it had 
been necessary, but it was not. Every want and wish that I 
have are kindly attended to. I am surrounded by good friends, 
who are ready and willing to serve me ; and you and Mary 
yourselves could not have been more assiduous in your attentions than are my friends the Calverts. 
</p><p>
The state of my health has not very materially altered. 
Within the last eight or ten days there has been some improvement ; not so great as my friends persuade themselves, but still 
some improvement. The solution of the proble-m of my recovery depends upon the distressing cough which I have, and I 
think that it is a little diminished. I am embargoed here by the severity of the winter, which has confined me to the house 
for the last three weeks. I hope to derive some benefit when I shall be again able to drive out in the open air. You must 
continue to write me without regard to my ability to reply. It is a source of great comfort to me to hear, and to hear fully, 
from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ashland" rel="city">Ashland</a> and Mansfield. John has been very kind in writing very frequently to me. Give my love to Mary and all the children.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, Although too unwell myself to write you, I 
can not withhold the expression, through the pen of a friend, 
of my thanks for your kind letter of the 10th instant, and for 
the warm interest which you take in my restoration to health. 
I thank you especially for your friendly offer to come hither 
and assist in nursing me ; but I am so extremely well attended 
in that respect, as not to render necessary the acceptance of your 
obliging offer. Present my warm regards to your sister, and tell 
her that as the probability is that neither of us is long for this 
world, I hope that when we go hence we shall meet in one far 
better. I am, with the greatest respect, etc.

</p><p>
My dear Susan, I received your letter of the 27th ultimo, 
and I had received that of James' of the 1st. I write now so 
uncomfortably and so slow, that I take up my pen with great 
repugnance. I was very glad to receive both of your letters, and 
was delighted to contemplate the picture of your domestic happiness with your husband and children. As the world recedes 
from me, I feel my affections more than ever concentrated on 
my children, and theirs. 
</p><p>
My health has improved a little within the last few weeks, but the cough still hangs on, and unless I can get rid of it, or greatly diminish it, I can not look for a radical cure. The winter has been excessively rigorous, and I have not been out of the house for eight weeks. You must not believe all you see in the newspapers, favorable or unfavorable, about my health. 
</p><p>
I hope you and James will continue to write to me, whether 
you receive regular replies or not. How has the dairy got through 
the winter? 
</p><p>
My love to James and all my dear grandchildren.

</p><p>
My dear Son, I received your letter of the 10th. I should 
have written you oftener, but I am so feeble, and write with so 
little comfort, that I take up the pen reluctantly. I hope that 
you and Susan, notwithstanding my apparent delinquency, will 
write me frequently, giving me full details of all your plans, improvements, and business. There is nothing now that interests 
me so much as to receive full accounts from the members of my 
family frequently. Although you have got more in debt than I 
could have wished, you ought to be very happy. In dear Susan 
you have an excellent wife, and you have a fine parcel of promising children, and you have ample means of support. 
</p><p>
I gave my deposition in your case with Miller week before 
the last, and it was sent to  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. It proved all that was 
expected of me. 
</p><p>
My health continues very delicate. I have not been out of 
the house for upward of two months. I can not recognize any 
encouraging change. My cough still hangs on, although I sometimes hope that it is a little abated. If I can not get rid of it, 
or at least greatly diminish it, I think it must prove fatal. But 
I may linger for months to come. I should be glad to get home 
once more. 
</p><p>
My love to Susan, and kisses for all the children. I would 
be glad to write more, but you can not conceive how this little 
letter has exhausted me.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, I received yonr favor transmitting an engrossed 
copy of the address which you did me the honor to make to me 
on the occasion of presenting the medal which my New York 
friends had offered me. I thank you for this corrected copy of 
the address which is very beautifully engrossed. 
</p><p>
The medal has been in the possession of the goldsmiths of 
this place, who desired the custody of it to gratify public curiosity. You wish it returned that a more accurate impression 
may be made by striking another. I examined it to see if I 
could discern the defect in the letters to which you refer, and I 
confess I could not. If to strike it again will occasion any 
trouble or expense to my friends, I think it might well be avoided, but if you persist in your desire to have it done, I will have 
it sent to you by Adams' Express next week. 
</p><p>
You rightly understood me in expressing a preference for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mif" rel="colleague met">Mr. Fillmore</a> as the Whig candidate for the Presidency. This I did 
before I left home, and have frequently here in private intercourse, since my arrival at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. I care not how generally the fact may be known, but I should not deem it right to 
pubhsh any formal avowal of that preference under my own signature in the newspapers. Such a course would subject me to 
the imputation of supposing that my opinions possessed more 
weight with the public than I apprehend they do. The foundation of my preference is, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mif" rel="colleague met">Mr. Fillmore</a> has administered the 
Executive Government with signal success and ability. He has 
been tried and found true, faithful, honest, and conscientious. I 
wish to say nothing in derogation from his eminent competitors, 
they have both rendered great services to their country ; the one 
in the field, the other in the Cabinet. They might possibly administer the Government as well as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mif" rel="colleague met">Mr. Fillmore</a> has done. But 
then neither of them has been tried ; he has been tried in the 
elevated position he now holds, and I think that prudence and 
wisdom had better restrain us from making any change without 
a necessity for it, the existence of which I do not perceive.

</p><p>
My dear Son, I received your letter of the 1st instant, and 
at the same time one from Susan. They both interested me, as 
I like to hear all the details of your business and operations. 
You find, as every body finds, building and improvement more 
expensive than you had expected. 
</p><p>
My health continues nearly stationary, not getting better nor 
worse, except in one particular, and that is sleep. Although I 
take an opiate every night, and lie in bed fourteen hours, I can 
get no sound, refreshing sleep, A man whose flesh, strength, 
appetite and sleep have been greatly reduced, must be in a bad 
way, but that is my condition. I have taken immense quantities of drugs ; but with little if any effect on my cough, the 
disease which threatens me. I may linger on some months, but 
if there be no speedy improvement, I must finally sink under it. 
</p><p>
Give my love to dear Susan and all your children. I hope that she will continue to write to me.

My dear Sir, I received your kind letter informing me of, 
the loss of the medal. I am truly sorry for the occurrence, and the 
more so because I ought to have followed your directions to send 
it by Adams' Express. But Miss Lynch being in my room the 
evening before she started for the city of New York, and being 
informed that I was about to send the medal to you, she kindly 
offered to take charge of it, and I accordingly placed it under 
her care. I have no doubt she suffers as much as any of us by 
its loss, and I would not say one word by way of reproach to 
her. I should be very sorry if any trouble or expense were 
taken in replacing it. The fact of its presentation, and even the 
representations upon the medal have been so widely diffused as 
to render the presentation of it historical. You will recollect 
that I jocosely remarked while you were here that some Goth, 
when I was laid low in the grave, might be tempted to break 
off my nose and use the valuable metal which it contains ! I 
did not then, however, anticipate the possibility of such an incident occurring so quickly.

My dear Son, I received your letter of the 8th. I was glad 
to receive your letter and to peruse all the details in it. 
</p><p>
My health continues without any material change. I am very 
weak, write with no comfort, sleep badly, and have very little 
appetite for my food. 
</p><p>
You must not mind what you see in the newspapers about 
me, such as that I was going to the Senate to make a speech, 
etc. Not a word of truth in it.

</p><p>
My dear Mary, I received your letter of the 30th ultimo, and thank you for it. Your letters always give me satisfaction, 
as they go into details and tell me things which nobody else writes. The state of my health remains pretty much as it has 
been. But little sleep, appetite, or strength. 
</p><p>
If I am spared, and have strength to make the journey, I think of going home in May or early in June, and in that case I wish 
to send for Thomas to accompany me. 
</p><p>
I wish you would ask your mother to pay a small note of mine held by Ike Shelby. I have just heard to-day of the 
death of Mr. Jacobs. Poor Susan must be overwhelmed with grief. 
</p><p>
We have had no good weather yet.

My love to Susan and the children.

My dear Son, I have heard of the death of Mr. Jacobs, and I offer to you and to Susan assurances of my cordial condolence. 
Tell her that I hope she will bear the event with the fortitude of a Christian. My health continues very feeble, so much so that I 
write with no comfort or ease, as you may infer from this letter being written by the pen of a friend. What will be the issue 
of my illness it is impossible to predict. My own opinion of the case is less favorable than that of my physicians. If my strength 
continues to fail me, I think I can not last a great while. I feel perfectly composed and resigned to my fate, whatever it may be.
