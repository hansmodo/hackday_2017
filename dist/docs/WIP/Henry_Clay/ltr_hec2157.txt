My dear Sir, I have just received your favor of the 27th. 
I did not know that the extract published by Mr. Pleasants was 
from a letter written by you. The same thing has been told 
to me by several, and, among others, by Mr. Wilson Allen, of 
the Bowling Green, and Colonel H. Mercer. I think you ought 
to take no notice of the contradiction of Mr. Ritchie. Your 
name is not before the public as the writer of the letter. If it 
were, you might be considered as pledged to sustain the assertion. 
Mr. Allen told me that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> warmest friends in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, after seeing him, admitted his incompetency for the 
office. I think I would let it stand where it does. We ought 
to make great allowances for chagrin and disappointment. I 
wish <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> could have been seen at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague met">Mr. Van Buren</a> told me that they had committed a great error in 
not withdrawing him in May last, on account of his want of 
health. 
</p><p>
From all quarters, the testimony which I get, public and private, of the public approbation of my late conduct, is full, complete, and triumphant. They are preparing in Kentucky to give 
me an enthusiastic reception. But you see they will not let me 
alone. Ingham has just made his appearance, and I wish he 
would write by the league instead of the yard. The next shot 
will be from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gmd" rel="colleague met">McDuffie</a>, or from Nashville, or from both.
