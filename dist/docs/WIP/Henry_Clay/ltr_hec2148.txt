</p><p>
My dear Sir, My position in relation to the friends of the 
three returned candidates is singular enough, and often to me 
very amusing. In the first place they all believe that my friends 
have the power of deciding the question, and then that I have 
the power of controlling my friends. Acting upon this supposition, in the same hour, I am sometimes touched gently on the 
shoulder by a friend, for example, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, who will 
thus address me, " My dear Sir, all my dependence is upon you, 
don't disappoint us, you know our partiality was for you next to 
the hero ; and how much we want a Western President." Immediately after a friend of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> will accost me, " The 
hopes of the Republican party are concentrated on you, for 
God's sake preserve it. If you had been returned, instead of Mr. Crawford, every man of us would have supported you to the 
last hour. We consider him and you as the only genuine Republican candidates." Next a friend of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> comes with 
tears in his eyes, " Sir, Mr. Adams has always had the greatest 
respect for you, and admiration of your talents. There is no 
station to which you are not equal. Most undoubtedly you 
are the second choice of New England, and I pray you to consider seriously whether the public good and your own future 
interests do not point most distinctly to the choice which you 
ought to make." How can one withstand all this disinterested 
homage and kindness? Really the friends of all three gentlemen are so very courteous and affectionate that I sometimes almost 
wish that it was in my power to accommodate each of them, 
but that being impossible, we are beginning to think seriously 
of the choice which we must finally make. I will tell you then 
that I believe the contest will be limited to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> personal condition precludes 
the choice of him if there were no other objection to his election. As the only alternative which is presented to us it is 
sufficiently painful, and I consider whatever choice we may 
make will be only a choice of evils. To both of those gentlemen there are strong personal objections. The principal difference between them is that in the election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> we shall 
not by the example inflict any wound upon the character of our 
institutions, but I should much fear hereafter, if not during the 
present generation, that the election of the General would give 
to the military spirit a stimulus and a confidence that might lead 
to the most pernicious results. I shall, therefore, with great regret on account of the dilemma in which the people have placed 
us, support <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. My friends are generally so inclined. 
What has great weight with me is the decided preference which 
a majority of the delegation from Ohio has for him over General 
Jackson. If, therefore, Kentucky were to vote for the General 
it would probably only have the effect of dividing our friends, 
without defeating ultimately the election of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. Three 
of the four States favorable to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> are believed to prefer <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> to the General. Virginia is one of them. I am 
inclined to think that nearly three-fourths of our delegation have 
yielded to the influence of these views, and will vote for Mr. 
Adams. My friends entertain the belief that their kind wishes 
toward me will in the end be more likely to be\accomplished 
by so bestowing their votes. I have, however, most earnestly 
entreated them to throw me out of their consideration in 
bringing their judgments to a final conclusion, and to look 
and be guided solely by the public good. If I know myself, 
that alone has determined me. Your Representative is in 
clined to concur with us in these sentiments and views, and if 
they should meet your approbation, as I know he has great respect for your opinions, I would be glad if you would by the return mail address a letter to him to strengthen him in his inclination. Be pleased to show this letter to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjc" rel="colleague met">Crittenden</a> alone.
