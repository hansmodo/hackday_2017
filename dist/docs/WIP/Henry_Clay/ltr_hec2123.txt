Dear Sir, I received your obliging favor of the 10th inst., 
from Frankfort, and thank you for the friendly feelings toward 
me of which it furnishes the evidence. On the subject of the 
next Governor I had communicated my views, prior to the receipt of your letter, to several friends at Frankfort, from whom 
you must have learned them before you left that place. I have 
regretted exceedingly my inability to conform to the wishes of 
those whose kindness has made them look to me for that office.

I am glad to find that the course which it seems to me fitting 
for this country to pursue, in respect to Spanish affairs, meets with 
your concurrence. The extraordinary one recommended by the 
President excited much surprise in Congress, and has, I think 
very few of that body disposed to adopt it. The general embarrassments throughout the country, the deficit in the Treasury, 
and other causes, have communicated their influence to Congress, 
and produced the efiect of great repugnance to war and to any 
augmentation of the national expenditure. Add to which the 
various alternatives which the failure of Spain to ratify the treaty 
presents to our choice, and I should not be surprised if the result 
should be that Congress will do nothing on Spanish affairs, but 
leave them where it found them. I should regret this very much, 
because I think it would be precisely the result most gratifying 
to Spain.

At present Spanish affairs, manufactures, and every other matter of public concern, have given way to the Missouri question, 
which engrosses the whole thoughts of the members, and constitutes almost the only topic of conversation. It is a most unhappy question, awakening sectional feelings, and exasperating 
them to the highest degree. The words, civil war, and disunion, 
are uttered almost without emotion, and a Senator of the United 
States, in his place, as I understand, said the other day that he 
would rather have both than fail in the resolution. I witnessed 
yesterday a display of astonishing eloquence, in the Senate, on 
the part of Mr. Pinkney of Indiana against the restriction. In 
that body the majority is with us ; in the House of Representatives it is doubtful. 
</p><p>
I think nothing will be done by Congress respecting the currency.
