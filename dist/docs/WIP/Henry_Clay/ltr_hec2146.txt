My dear Sir, Your favor of the 29th October, addressed to 
me at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, not finding me there, has returned and been 
duly received by me here. Events subsequent to its date render 
it unnecessary for me to say any thing in regard to Mr. Ritchie's communication about the Vice-Presidency. I have also received your obliging letter of the first instant. I had before 
learned the issue of the electoral vote of Virginia. I was prepared to expect it by all that I had previously observed. Two 
weeks ago a course might have been taken which would probably have prevented that result of the Presidential election now 
most likely to happen ; and that was to have prevailed upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> to withdraw, which might have been done, I should 
suppose, without mortification to his friends, by placing it on the 
ground of the continued precarious state of his health. As it is, 
I shall yield a cheerful acquiescence in the public decision. I 
should indeed have been highly gratified if my native State had 
thought me worthy of even a second place in her confidence and 
affection. The obligations and respect which I owe her forbid 
my uttering one word of complaint on account of her having 
thought otherwise. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> deserves all that you say of him. He is a most 
captivating man.
