Dear Sir, The last mail brought me the letter which you 
did me the honor to write on the 30th ultimo, stating your expectation of a vacancy in the Department of War, and communicating your wish that I would take upon myself the discharge 
of the duties of that office. Several considerations appear to me 
to require that I should decline accepting the honor which your 
favorable opinion has tendered. I regret the necessity of this 
decision the less, as I hope that you will fill the place equally 
agreeably to yourself, and I am sure more advantageously to the 
public interest. I pray you, however, to believe that I shall 
always entertain the highest sense of this new proof of your 
confidence, and that, with the greatest respect and esteem, I am 
your obedient servant.
