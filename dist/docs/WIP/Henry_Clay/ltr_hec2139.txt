Dear Sir, Your favor under date at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> on the 
27th of June, has followed me from  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> to this place. I 
thank you for it. The position which it portrays of the condition of things in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, compared with other modes of ascertaining its correctness, I should suppose faithful. It certainly 
offers every motive to animated and persevering exertion. I 
concur with you in thinking, that the appearance in my favor 
of two papers you have mentioned, as being willing so to come 
out, would be advantageous. On their part, it is perfectly voluntary. They are unbought. No imputation of that kind 
could possibly be made. None can be made against me, either 
of Clintonian or Federal taint. Or if such imputations were 
made they would not be credited by the unbiased or impartial, 
who must compose a large portion of the American population. 
</p><p>
Before I came to this State, popular meetings in various counties had been held. Some have occurred since I entered it. 
The evidence derivable from their expression of preference 
among the presidential candidates, places beyond all sort of doubt 
the final result here. 
</p><p>
I shall leave this place to-morrow, for  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>.
