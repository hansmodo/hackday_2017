My dear Sir, In great haste I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 13th March. Walker would undertake 
to explore your lands, and report to you particularly their situation, quality, and value. He would charge for the service, only 
his expenses, that is to say, about $2 per day, for twelve or 
fifteen days. He is a man of perfect integrity, and may be 
relied on for such an undertaking. When I spoke, in a former 
letter, of him, I did not mean to imply any question of his veracity, but merely to convey the idea, that he was a laughing, 
talking, good-natured sort of a fellow, who might express himself somewhat at random, unless he knew precision to be necessary. 
</p><p>
He himself recommends Daniel Ashley at Madisonville as a 
person on whom you may rely to report the desired information. 
Major Walker's address is " David Walker, Russellville, Ky."
