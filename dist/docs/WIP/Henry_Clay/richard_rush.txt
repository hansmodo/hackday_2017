My dear Sir, - I have just read Lord Grey's speech, and can 
not resist the desire I have to send it to you. You will recognize in it sentiments I have expressed as regards Mr. Canning 
and the new States. If Earl Grey had been better informed, he 
would have said that it was you who did most to call them into 
being. I say this in no idle spirit of praise, having always, abroad 
and at home, expressed the opinion that, next to their own exertions, the South Americans owe to you more than to any 
other man in either hemisphere, their independence, you having 
led the way to our acknowledgment of it. This is truth ; this 
is history. Without our acknowledgment, England would not 
have taken the step to this day. This is my belief. I give 
Mr. Canning no credit for the part he acted. It was forced upon 
him by our lead, which he never had the magnanimity to avow, 
but strove to claim all the merit for England, or rather for himself. He esteems civil and political liberty no more than Lord Londonderry did, though circumstances have made him appear 
to be somewhat more their champion. That our public should 
be inclined to rejoice at Mr. Canning's present triumph, is, I 
think, the effect of his character not being understood among us. 
Certainly, as regards the United States, he has been, of all British 
statesmen, the least disposed to do us justice ; yes, truly, the 
least of any that ever we have had to deal with, without a single exception. Forgetting, if we can, all that he has said of us, let us take his acts ; for was it not he who disavowed Erskine's 
arrangement, which, had it been sanctioned in England, might 
have prevented a war ? Was it not he v/ho in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1823">1823</a> infused the 
unfriendly tone into that long negotiation at London, almost 
refusing to listen to nine out of ten of our claims, obviously 
just as most of them were ? And was it not he, who, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1826">1826</a>, 
most abruptly closed the West India trade against us, upon pretexts the most unexpected and flimsy ? I could make the list 
longer, but that I should make too long a letter of it, having intended to do nothing more than send you Lord Grey's speech. 
I know how high you rate his speeches. Mr. Canning never 
liked the United States or their institutions, and never will, his 
Liverpool speech, and the conclusion of his late dispatch, notwithstanding. He will watch all our steps with a sharper and 
more active jealousy than perhaps any other English statesman 
living. Of all their public men, we have the least to expect from him.

MR. RUSH TO <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="colleague met friend">MR. CLAY</a>. 
</p><p>
December 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1827">1827</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Mr. Clay, - Your invitation and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met aquaintance">Mrs. Clay's</a> to your 
winter evenings, got to my hands this morning, and I have 
passed it to my wife's. She will be most happy to be with 
you, as often as in her power. For myself, I am a slave, a very 
slave, the charter of whose present existence cuts him off from 
all and every such indulgence, even though tendered by " Your 
Excellence," as Kit Hughes would say. In truth, I am so galled, 
so whipped up, so ground down, morning, noon, and night, and 
night, noon, and morning, by being head overseer, and journeyman too, of the octogenarian department, that I was forced to 
make a vow and covenant on the first day of the session, not to 
break bread out of my own house (and miserable brown stuff 
it is that I break there just now), by day or by night till the 
session is over, if it lasts till doomsday, and we know that it is 
to last almost as long. This is a hard fate to undergo, and for 
one who likes good cheer, and has always been accustomed to 
it, moderately at least ; yet it is to be my fate without mitigation, unless perchance I should ever break its bonds by darkening the threshold, once in awhile, of " our worthy little master" over the way. As to our most potent sovereign lords and masters upon the hill, they would scourge me to death, you 
know, or flay me alive, if I do not mind their business ; so the 
only way in which I, or mortal man like me, can compass that, 
and mind all the other treasury business to boot, big and little, 
which never stops (including a daily quantum of the most horrible parts which I never should have had to mind if our said 
lords and masters had deigned to grant me the humble boon I 
once asked of a little more clerical aid at the desks of my superannuated beureaus), is by digging and fagging by night as well as by day. This is the long and short of the story. By leading this anti-social life - ^liard penance as it is - I shall hope to flounder through the session without being impeached ; and if 
God spares me till it is over, as good Christians should say, I will resume good fellowship with you and others once more I 
trust. But, till then, farewell to evening parties all, farewell to 
dinners ; farewell to such dinners, even, as yours, to which, when 
bidden, I have never heretofore said nay - to all, farewell. 
Othello's occupation's gone! 
</p><p>
I have forced an answer upon you, and a long-winded one - 
though the requisition is scratched out from your kind billet.

Washington, August 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1828">1828</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Mr. Clay, - Although I have had little or nothing to say, 
I should, at least, have dropped you a line since you went away, 
if only to tell you that we are all alive here ; but you have been 
whirled about so from post to pillar, that I have not known 
where to aim a letter at you. You have been bargaining all 
over the land, no doubt. No sooner have I heard of your being 
at one place, but the next mail has fixed you at another, and the 
third somewhere else again ; but now that you are in Lexington, 
I may hope that you will remain at moorings awhile. 
</p><p>
First and foremost, I am glad to learn that your health is 
better. Next, I congratulate you on the issue of the Louisiana 
election, hoping that you will follow suit in old Kentuck. 
</p><p>
The President sets out for the North to-morrow. He expects 
to be gone a couple of months. [ am highly pleased with our 
new colleague, General Porter. If I do not mistake, there is a 
fine mixture of suavity and energy in him. The former is very 
apparent and attractive ; you would come at the latter, I suspect, 
as soon as you get below the surface. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Be sure you bring good tidings from Kentucky, or 
we will give you no welcome on your return. 
</p><p>
P. S. August 4. - Hearing to-day that you are expected to 
leave Lexington on the 10th, and not being sure that this will 
reach you there, I will just fold it up to wait your arrival. 
</p><p>

My dear Sir, - Is there no way in which, without doing violence to whatever opinions or feelings you may have as respects 
masonry, or without offending that institution, you could conciliate to a fair and reasonable extent the good will of Anti-Masons, between this and September? I am sure that, in this State, 
there are many, very many, of the latter, who notwithstanding 
what is said in the newspapers, ardently desire to give their support to you, for the sake of the great public objects and principles inseparably interwoven with your name, and which they 
fear the permanent prostration of, should <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj">General Jackson</a> be reelected. I throw this out again, not to put you to the trouble of 
a reply, but only for you again to think of it, in conjunction 
with discreet friends in the West. You will do, I know, now as 
always, what duty, honor, and true patriotism require. With 
the direct aid of Anti-Masons, we should carry your banner to a 
glorious victory, even if we do not without.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - I am living here- on a few acres that I like so 
much better than the town, that although near enough to hear 
its bells, when the wind sets right, I never go there when 
I can help it, and have nothing to do with its business, which is 
mentioned merely to account for my being behind the world in 
important matters and movements that are going on. As well 
as I can catch some of these at present, it would seem that you 
are about to withdraw from the Senate, and if so, I am unable 
any longer to stand out against an impulse that puts the pen into 
my hand, making me say, how, amid all the mutations of the 
last ten years, I have, under all circumstances, done justice to 
your patriotism, in alliance with all the other qualities, to mark 
you out as the true head of the party, whose principles you 
have so pre-eminently espoused. Such a testimony can be of no value to you, but it gratifies me to give it utterance from my 
seclusion and leisure out here, founded as it is on convictions 
derived while associated with you in the public service, and although not able to side with that party in public measures, I 
continue to think that it will do great injustice to itself, if it 
does not regard you as its natural candidate for the highest 
honor it can bestow. At a 4th of July celebration in the neighborhood of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1840">1840</a>, I expressed this sentiment as strongly as I could. General Harrison then being its candidate, which 
may have been too unimportant to have fallen under your notice, as published in the papers of the day, and which is only alluded to now, as the recorded and steady feelings prompting 
these lines to you. 
</p><p>
I am too much out of the world to be informed if <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met aquaintance">Mrs. Clay</a> 
is at Washington. If she is, Mrs. Rush, who often recalls her 
agreeable intercourse with her family, requests me to convey 
her affectionate remembrances to her, and her compliments to 
you. I am glad to say she is quite well, and beginning to think 
of her honeysuckles and roses as the spring approaches, if indeed 
we have not had it all the winter. With some grown-up daughters now around her, we are about as well content and happy 
as we can expect, and both of us much inclined to the old 
Frenchman's maxim, that " every thing is for the best, in this best of worlds." 
</p><p>
In the sentiments I have thus thrown upon you, when supposing that you are about to retire from your present position, 
and in those of invariable personal esteem, I beg you 1o believe me, my dear sir, very faithfully yours.

</p><p>
Mt dear Sir, - I follow my letter of yesterday, with this 
of to-day. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1833">1833</a>, when I first came to live here, I threw out 
a volume founded on my mission to England, in the course of 
which (chapter 17, closing part), if so humble a production 
ever came under your eye, you will have seen that I alluded to 
your early exertions in behalf of Spanish American emancipation. 
</p><p>
I am contemplating some continuation of the work, and may 
have occasion to speak somewhat more fully perhaps on that 
topic, as connected with the claim the English make for Mr. Canning, that it was he who first called that part of our continent into independent existence. This is not true, though 
he had great merit in that question - more, I think, than any 
statesman of England or Europe, of that day. You may perhaps remember that I had some very confidential intercourse and 
correspondence with Mr. Canning, on this whole matter, which, 
in fact, laid the foundation of Mr. Monroe's famous Message in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1823">1823</a>. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear sir, will you do me so great a favor as to drop 
me a few lines at your convenience, giving me the date of your 
first movement in the House of Representatives on this subject ; 
I mean the one which distinctly looked to our recognition of the 
new States? I could trace it through back newspapers and other 
sources, for I well remember your early speeches on the subject, 
but a few lines from yourself would be more satisfactory to me, 
and the opportunity for this correspondence seems more favorable 
to me now, than after you get to Lexington, should you go 
there soon. 
</p><p>
I pray you to excuse the trouble it may give you, and in the 
renewed feelings of yesterday, I remain yours very faithfully.
</p><p>
