My dear Sir, I received your favor inclosing a statement 
relative to Garland's debt, and bank notes amounting to $35, 
being $3 more than was the balance agreeably to the statement. I have since received a letter from Mr. Hoomes, in 
which he acknowledges that I have overpaid the proportion of 
the purchase of Buzzard coming from me. But as I have the 
collection, in Kentucky, of some money for his father's estate, 
there will be no difficulty in adjusting the excess. I am much 
indebted to the kindness of your brother and yourself for your 
attention to this matter, and I can not agree that he shall be 
without compensation for his trouble. I must, therefore, request 
that you will pay him $20, for which, as well as for the $3 
above mentioned, you shall be credited in the taxes upon your 
land. I do not think the present a very favorable period for 
selling your land, which I have no doubt is gradually rising in 
value. If, however, you are desirous to effect a sale, your object would probably be facilitated by such a descriptive survey 
of it as you mention. I can hardly suppose a survey necessary 
to the perpetuation of the boundaries ; surveys in that county 
having been generally made in connection, in such manner that 
they tend to prove each other, and the removal of the corner 
of one would derange the whole block. Instances have, indeed, 
occurred there of such fraudulent attempts ; but I believe they are 
rare. Should you desire to possess such an account of the quality of your lands as will enable you to satisfy the inquiries of 
purchasers, I need not say that, on this, as well as any other 
matter interesting to you, I shall take pleasure in promoting 
your wishes.
