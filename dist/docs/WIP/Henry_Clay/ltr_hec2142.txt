Dear Sir, I duly received your obliging favor of the 19th 
ultimo, under date at New York, transmitting a letter from Mr. Ingalls, from whom I had previously received a duplicate. I did 
not, however, answer his letter. Eight months ago, I supposed 
there would be no difficulty in my election as Vice-President, if 
my friends had thought it advisable to press me for that office. I 
It would now be extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to effect that object, if it were desirable. My friends in the West do 
not attach any very great, perhaps not sufficient, importance to 
that station ; and it would be, I apprehend, nearly impossible now 
to induce them to divert their support of me from the first to the 
second office. And if they could be prevailed on to do it, the 
electoral colleges would hardly be induced, by any possible exertion, to unite their individual suffrages on any other candidate 
for the Presidency. There could, therefore, be no support se- . 
cured for me in the Atlantic States for the Vice-Presidency, if it I 
depended on concert among my Western friends, in regard to the 
office of President. And consequently, if I received any, it must 
be spontaneous, without reference to the direction which my interest would take as to the Presidency. If my Eastern friends 
think proper to bring me forward for the office of Vice-President, 
I wish it distinctly understood, that it is their own movement, 
unprompted by me. If an idea were taken up that the office 
was sought by me, after all that has occurred, it could not fail 
to be injurious to me. It would be said to display a most inordinate desire for office, which I certainly am not conscious of 
feeling. It would not look well, in any respect, if it were supposed that I was instrumental in the attempt to elect me. It is 
certainly a high and dignified office, such as no American citizen 
could readily decline. 
</p><p>
With respect to the movement in Massachusetts to which Mr. 
Ingalls refers, while I concur with you entirely in the state of 
public feeling in New England toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, I do not believe that there is the smallest prospect of diverting the vote of 
Massachusetts from him. There may be some probability of 
such a diversion in other States of that section, but none whatever, I apprehend, in Massachusetts. Depend upon it, that local 
pride, if not attachment, will secure to each of the candidates 
the support of his own State, doubtless with more opposition in 
some instances than in others. It would, therefore, be an act of 
extreme indiscretion, justified by no motive whatever, for me, or 
for any of my friends out of Massachusetts, to say to Mr. Ingalls, 
and to those who are co-operating with him, that I am willing 
to give up all pretensions to the office of President, and to be 
contented with that of Vice-President. 
</p><p>
By the by, it has been said here that a feeling is prevailing in 
some of the Atlantic cities to make the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="colleague met">Marquis Lafayette</a> Vice President. Such a disposition of the office would be highly 
creditable to the national gratitude, if it could be made without 
any constitutional impediment. 
</p><p>
I do not anticipate much from the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> meeting. It 
is a little remarkable, that my support of the tariff has excited 
against me, in the South, a degree of opposition which is by no 
means counterbalanced by any espousal of my cause in Pennsylvania and other quarters, where the tariff was so much desired. 
Is this owing to the greater activity which the losing party 
almost always displays than the gaining? 
</p><p>
I expect every day that the Committee of Correspondence, appointed by the Legislature of the State, will prepare their general circular, as suggested in my last. A copy of it shall be forwarded to you. Do you correspond with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pbp" rel="colleague friend met">General Peter B. Porter</a>? His residence is Black Rock. 
</p><p>
I can not close without expressing to you my thanks for the 
zeal and interest which you manifest in my favor ; nor without 
adding, that you have fulfilled entirely all my expectations as to 
the discretion which you would manifest. 
</p><p>
