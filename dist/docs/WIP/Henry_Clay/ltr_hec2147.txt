My DEAR Sir, I received your letter by your son, and had 
great pleasure in furnishing him with a letter of introduction to 
Commodore Rogers. 
</p><p>
I have also received that of the 21st instant, and will examine 
the claim to which it refers, with all the prepossessions which 
arise from your opinion, and my high regard to you. 
</p><p>
The result in Louisiana did not surprise or affect me. There 
was much misfortune attending it nevertheless.
</p><p>
We must not despair of the Republic. Our institutions, if they 
have the value which we believe them to possess, and are worth 
preserving, will sustain themselves, and we shall yet do well. 
</p><p>
A bill passed the House of Representatives to-day (166 to 26) 
giving to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="colleague met">Lafayette</a> $200,000 and a township of land.
