</p><p>
Limestone, March 31,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1813">1813</a>.

Henry Clay presents his respectful compliments to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Mr. Beatty</a>. 
His solicitude to reach home prevents him from having the 
pleasure to see <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Mr. Beatty</a>, whose favors he ought to have acknowledged at the city. With every disposition to serve Colonel 
C. B., he regrets his inability to have done so. Under the regular establishment of the military there were no vacancies worthy 
his notice. Under the act for raising twenty thousand infantry 
for the term of one year, when Henry Clay left  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> it 
was understood that but one regiment would be allotted to K., 
and the field officers of that regiment were determined upon prior 
to Mr. B.'s application, although not announced. Henry Clay 
could not interfere with the contemplated arrangement. 
</p><p>
Henry Clay paid <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Mr. Beatty</a>'s last year's subscription to the 
" Intelligencer," and was reimbursed before he left K. What is 
due he forgot to pay, but will discharge on his return to the city 
He can add no news to the public prints.
