If Virginia is to designate a Senator upon the principle of 
opposition to the administration, let that Senator be Mr. B. Giles. 
He would be a real friend, though a nominal enemy. I mean 
that his indiscretions, always great, and now greater than ever, 
would benefit more than his hostility would injure. But I 
should hope that no such principle would govern the choice. I 
should be delighted to see Governor Pleasants here, or General 
Tucker, or Mr. C. Johnson. Of the latter I know personally 
but little ; but the accounts I have always had of him are highly 
favorable. It is of no great consequence, in respect to the success or movement of the Administration, who may be sent. The 
judgment which the public will form of it, depends upon its 
measures. And one Senator out of forty-eight can not, in that 
view of the matter, be very essential. You will hear with 
pleasure, that our harmony, in the cabinet, continues without 
the slightest interruption, and that we have daily testimonies 
of increased strength and confidence.

The President has acceded to the wishes of several of the 
new American Republics, that the United States should be represented at Panama. Our friends need have no fears of our 
contracting there unnecessary or onerous engagements, or menacing the peace or neutrality of the country.

There is a treaty now going on in this city with the Creeks, 
with prospects of a successful issue.
