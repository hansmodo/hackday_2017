</p><p>
Frankfort, May 31,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1810">1810</a>.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Dr. Beatty</a>, I received your favor, with the specimen inclosed of your merino's fleece, and compared it with one which 
I took from a full-blooded merino of General Mason's, and find 
very little difference between them. If you could send your 
wool, or the yarn, to a manufacturer in Danville, he would make 
you the best piece of cloth that you could obtain from it. I do 
not recollect his name, but he is an Englishman, accustomed to 
the business, and has undertaken, for Judge Todd, to make him 
a coat which he warrants shall not be inferior to the best imported cloth in the State. I propose sending mine to him. If, 
however, you prefer having it made in the neighborhood of 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, there will be no difficulty in getting it wove, fulled, 
etc. 
</p><p>
I am glad to learn that your election to the Legislature is 
deemed certain. Your presence there will be extremely necessary. I am solicitous for it on various accounts. You will have 
heard that I am no longer a candidate for the Senate, and that 
my successor will consequently be appointed. May not the 
Federalists attempt to rally in support of one of their party? 
This should be looked to. 
</p><p>
In offering for the House of Representatives, I was influenced 
by a partiality for the station, and by the wishes of some of my 
friends, as well here as to the East. I contemplate, however 
serving out the term for which I am already appointed in the 
Senate, not wishing to give the trouble of supplying my place 
for the ensuing session, and being desirous to prevent the possibility of the State being partially represented daring a considerable portion of it.
