</p><p>
My dear Sir, From your letter of the 5th instant, which I 
this day received, I perceive you are at home, and not at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, to which I had transmitted to you one of my addresses to 
my constituents. The favorable opinion entertained of it by 
such early and valuable friends as yourself and Nicholas, is highly 
gratifying. Among other similar testimonies from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, I 
have received, from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jom" rel="colleague met">Chief Justice</a>, a very satisfactory letter. 
Prior to the publication of my address, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jot" rel="colleague met">Mr. Tyler</a> wrote me a 
letter, approving of my course (since he believed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> 
to have been out of the question), and declaring, in strong terms, 
his unabated confidence in me. From all quarters, in short, 
information is constantly pouring in upon me, in every form, 
evincing general and hearty approbation of my late public 
course. My triumph will be, as it ought, complete and entire 
over the base confederacy against me. As to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsythe</a>, he certainly advised me, in unqualified terms, to accept the Department 
of State. I myself attached no particular importance to his 
opinion, though I supposed others might. He was with me on 
the 30th or 29th of last month, had a long conversation, in the 
course of which he praised my address, and, e7itre nous, gave in 
his adhesion. I have no curiosity to see his letter. I understand him thoroughly. He did not mention one word about his 
letter to you, or his correspondence with you. What could he 
say to me? 
</p><p>
I share with you in your grief for the death of Mrs. Randolph. 
I have known her from my earliest youth. She deserved all 
that you have so well said in behalf of her memory. 
</p><p>
I find my office no bed of roses. With spirits never more 
buoyant, twelve hours work per day are almost too much for my 
physical frame. An entire harmony as to public measures exists 
between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and me. 
</p><p>
I return you Nicholas' letter. 
</p><p>
P. S, Was ever any thing so silly as for Eaton to pubHsh his 
correspondence with me? I am greatly deceived if he has not 
come out worse than he stood before.
