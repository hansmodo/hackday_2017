<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, April 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, - The events which have within a few days 
passed in this city, and in its neighborhood, have changed every 
thing in France but the character of the Parisians, and perhaps 
of Frenchmen in general. 
</p><p>
On the 30th ult. a battle was fought in the vicinity of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> 
by the French troops under the Duke of Ragusa, amounting to 
between fifteen and twenty thousand men, and the grand allied 
army. The loss was considerable on both sides, but that of the 
Allies was more than double. It is estimated from eight to ten 
thousand men. The disparity in the loss was the result of the 
strong positions of the French troops, and the desire of the allies 
to get possession of the capital before the arrival of the Emperor Napoleon, who was advancing by rapid marches upon their 
rear. This desire was so predominant that they made no attempt to turn these positions, but marched directly up to the entrenchment's, where they were repulsed four or five times. The battle commenced about 4 o'clock A. M. and finished about the same 
time in the evening. The Duke of Ragusa entered into a convention by which he agreed to evacuate the city, taking with 
him all his baggage, ammunition and artillery. 
</p><p>
The next day the Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia entered <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> at the head of about fifty thousand of the finest troops 
in the world. The remainder of their immense army either defiled 
on the north or south side of the city, or remained in their positions on the east, which was the field of battle. The Emperor of Russia, with his Minister of Foreign Relations, went directly to the house of the Prince of Benevento, who convened 
the Senate the same evening, and had himself and three of his 
friends, with one devoted Bourbonite, named to the provisional 
government. The Senate had deposed Napoleon Bonaparte, and 
directed the provisional government to form a Constitution, which 
has been accomplished, and accepted by the Senate and the small 
portion of the Legislative corps who are now in Paris. The Moniteur of this day contains this Constitution, which you will probably see before you receive this letter. The monarchy is declared 
to be hereditary in the house of Bourbon in the male line. The 
present Senators remaining Senators of the realm by the same 
tenure. The Senate to consist of one hundred and fifty at least, 
and not more than two hundred. The ancient and new nobility to 
remain. All Frenchmen to be capable of filling all the offices of 
the government. The members of the legislative corps to hold 
their offices for five years, and to be elected directly by the people. 
</p><p>
The proceedings of the Senate and of the provisional government, have overturned the authority of the Emperor with his 
army, and especially with his ablest generals. He seems to have 
sunk without an effort, "at least without an effort corresponding in 
any degree with his former fame. Such at least is the conclusion which I draw from the facts which are communicated to the 
public. It is possible that these facts may be misrepresented. I 
believe, however, that it is certain, that he has agreed to retire 
with his family to the Isle of Elba upon a pension of six millions of livres. From the moment that he saw that it was impossible for him to reign he ought to have died. The manner 
was in his election. A strange infatuation seems to have influenced his conduct during the last six months. Still relying 
upon his talents and his power he refused, at Prague, to secure 
at least the neutrality of Austria, by giving her every thing she 
required. After having retreated across the Rhine he reluctantly 
accepted the basis which the Allies proposed, and which there is 
some reason to believe they were sincerely disposed to adopt. 
Lord Castlereagh's mission, however, according to the best view* 
of the subject which I have been able to take, was intended 
solely to prevent this accommodation. Time will prove the accuracy or inaccuracy of this opinion. There must have been 
great address employed in managing the Emperor of Austria, 
who had rejected all idea of overthrowing the reigning dynasty. 
The infatuation of the Emperor, and his arrogance to his father-in-law (if we are to credit reports apparently well founded), 
greatly contributed to the success of the arts employed by the 
British Secretary. That the Emperor of Austria has been duped 
is clearly established by the declaration of the Allies after the 
breaking up of the Congress at Chatillon, and by the conduct of 
Lord Wellington, This declaration states that up to the 15th 
of March they were ready to make peace with the Emperor Napoleon, whereas the address of Lord Wellington, on the 2d of 
February, declares Louis XVIIL and raises the Bom-bon standard. The introduction of the ancient dynasty is not acceptable to the great body of the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. Even now, after the Senate and provisional government have declared for that 
dynasty, there is not one man in a hundred who puts on the 
white cockade. On the day of the entry of the allied sovereigns, all the persons devoted to their ancient kings endeavored to make themselves as conspicuous as possible, and to conceal the smallness of their numbers by continual change of place. 
Exertions were made to excite popular feeling and popular tumult, but without effect. But for the National Guard popular tumult 
would have been excited, perhaps, but not in favor of the Bourbons. If the mob of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> had been put in motion it would have been in favor of a free government. 
</p><p>
The men now in power would, as far as I have been able to judge, have preferred the succession of the King of Rome, 
with a regency provided by the Empress ; but the Emperor Alexander, who, under the modest exterior of submitting every 
thing to the will of the French people, dictates to the Senate and provisional government, at least this article of their Constitution. 
</p><p>
I did not anticipate precisely the manner in which this European peace was to he consummated. I most sincerely wish you 
complete success in your negotiations, although I apprehend that 
great difficulties will be presented. Under existing circumstances, if peace is made, I presume that the treaty will be very 
short, concluding nothing but peace and the restoration of what territory may be in the hands of either party by conquest, if there is any such. 
</p><p>
P. S . I send this by the Secretary of the Danish Legation, who sets out immediately for Copenhagen, which gives me no 
opportunity for reflection or revision of this hasty scrawl, as I have just been informed of the fact of his setting out.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, June 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>. 
</p><p>
Mt dear Sir, - Mr. Carroll arrived a few days ago, and 
brought me your letters of the 10th and 14th ultimo. The 
change in the place of the negotiation for peace will enable me 
to write to you frequently, and will afford me the pleasure of 
receiving from you the most interesting details upon the advances 
which you shall make from day to day in the work of peace. 
</p><p>
My expectations of a happy result are not strong. The arrogance 
of the enemy was never greater than at the present moment. 
The infatuation of that nation exceeds almost the possibility of 
peace. The ministry are represented as being very temperate 
and moderate. In my former communications I have stated the 
reasons which I have for doubting the sincerity of their professions of moderation. I may have been wrong in my inferences. 
I wish that the result may correct me of this error. Admitting 
the possibility that the British ministers will consent to make 
peace, without deciding any thing upon the question of impressment, will your instructions justify you in accepting it ? So far 
as I am acquainted with the nature of those instructions, their 
letter will not. But these instructions were given at a time when 
the great changes which have intervened in Europe were not 
only unknown, but wholly unexpected. What will be the effect 
which these changes will produce upon the determinations of 
the Government ? Will the Government, after they are informed 
of these changes, give directions to conclude peace, leaving the 
question of impressment open to further negotiation ? Will it 
consent to a peace which shall make no mention of this question ? 
[ presume it will. If the negotiators shall be of this opinion, 
ought they to hesitate to accept, in the most prompt manner, of 
a peace which they are convinced the Government will instruct 
them to make, as soon as it is informed of the actual state of 
things ? I should answer promptly. No. A peace which omits 
the question of impressment entirely, will leave the American 
Government at perfect liberty to apply the proper remedy, whenever the evil shall be felt. I do not believe that you will be 
placed in a situation to determine this question. I believe they 
will insist upon the unqualified admission of their right to impress on board American vessels at sea. This, I trust, will never 
be conceded. It would be better to return to our colonial relations with our mother country, than submit to this condition. If 
it must be conceded, a federal President must make the concession. As there is but a faint glimmering of hope that the negotiation will terminate in peace, the next important point to be 
obtained is, that it shall break off, upon principles which will 
convince the American people, of all parties, that peace can be 
obtained only by the most vigorous prosecution of the war. I 
have the most unlimited confidence in the skill and address of 
our negotiators. I am perfectly satisfied that the negotiation will be conducted with a view to affect this important point. I have 
seen and conversed with several Englishmen in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, upon the 
question of impressment, and find the most of them very ignorant 
and arrogant. Sir Thomas Baring is an exception to this remark. 
But his mode of adjusting this question is wholly inadmissible. 
He proposes that no impressment shall be made in vessels engaged in the coasting trade - that no impressment shall take 
place in vessels engaged in the foreign trade, in sight of the 
American coast. He thinks the ministry will hardly go so 
far. A merchant of the name of Wilson says that an arrangement of a different nature would be satisfactory to the 
nation. It is this, that when a British officer should visit an 
American vessel, and designate any one of the crew as a British 
subject, and he should admit the fact, that the master or captain 
of the American vessel should deliver him up. If the man should 
deny that he is an Englishman, and the captain should refuse to 
deliver him, that the visiting officer should endorse the ship's 
papers with the name of the sailor, and with his allegation. The 
question of nationality shall be inquired into, at the first port at 
which the vessel shall touch, where there is a British consul ; if 
found against the sailor, the captain shall pay a fine, or the expenses of the investigation, and the sailor shall be delivered up. 
If for him, the British Consul, or if in England, the British Government should be subject to the same payment. He says, that 
in the case of an admitted British subject, if the American captain should declare that the loss of the man would endanger the 
vessel, that he should be kept on board until the vessel entered 
the port of destination, when the captain should be bound to 
deliver him over to the British Consul, or officer authorized to 
receive him. I see no objection to this plan, except that the 
captain should not be permitted to deliver any man who denies 
the charge, until it is established against him. This arrangement will give the enemy the absolute control over their own 
seamen, as far as the fact of nationality can be established. It 
at the same time secures American sailors from arbitrary impressment. If the vessel should be bound to the ports of a nation 
at war with England, it might be made the duty of the American 
Consul at such port to ship him on board of an American vessel 
bound to England, to the United States, or to a neutral port, 
where the fact should be promptly settled. I do not believe that 
this arrangement will be acceptable to the Government of England, because I do not believe they will be satisfied with any 
arrangement which will prevent their seizing upon the sailors 
of other nations. If I am correct in my conjecture, the proposition will embarrass them, and the rejection will prove, to the 
most prejudiced mind, that they are determined to make the 
American sailors fight the battles which are to rivet the chains 
of slavery, which they have been forging for all maritime states, 
and especially for the seafaring men of these states, for a century 
past. I have thought that this arrangement ought to be suggested to you, because it may not have occurred to any one of 
our ministers. I think it highly improbable that the English 
negotiators will make any proposition of this nature. If their 
pretensions shall be so moderate as to afford rational ground for 
discussion, this arrangement may be proposed with advantage. 
</p><p>
If their views are so unreasonable as to exclude discussion, 
that of itself will have the happy effect of convincing all parties 
that the peace must be obtained by the sword alone. But even 
in this case, when the rejection of the arrangement will be certain, I am inclined to believe that the proposition, coming from 
the American ministers, will have a tendency to elucidate the 
extent of the concessions which they demand upon this point, 
more satisfactorily than any other mode which has been presented 
to my mind. Mr. Wilson is a true John Bull, but, I believe, a 
very honest man, and, I am sure, sincerely desirous of peace. 
The rejection of the arrangement will probably have some effect 
upon the English nation itself. If this principle will be satisfactory to Mr. Wilson, it is probable that it will be acceptable to 
many others - in fact, to all reasonable men - to all men who 
have not formed the foolish and extravagant idea of re-colonizing 
the United States. 
</p><p>
I have felt that it was my duty to present this subject to you 
in its fullest extent. I have verbally communicated it to Mr. Bayard. It is probable that Mr. Wilson may have communicated this idea to Mr. Gallatin, as he made his acquaintance, and that 
of Mr. Bayard's also, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>. He had not suggested it to the latter. 
</p><p>
I will obtain the necessary passports for you, and send them 
on to Ghent, as the Mojiiieur of yesterday has notified that it is 
necessary to have them to leave the kingdom. I suppose it is 
equally necessary'' to enter it. Prom the letters which I have 
written to you, you will perceive that some of my inferences have been proved, by subsequent events, to be incorrect, I 
reasoned from the facts as they were presented to my mind, and 
I feel no mortification at the result. If it was my duty to communicate every thing to you which I knew, or believed, at the 
moment of writing, I do not feel any mortification that some of 
my conjectures, some of my inferences, have proved to be incorrect. 
</p><p>
I have authority to draw on the bankers of the United States 
for diplomatic intercourse, and for disbursements for distressed 
seamen. Under the first head, I can satisfy Mr. Carroll's expenses, and shall do it with great pleasure on his own account, 
as well as upon your request. I am well acquainted with his 
father, and entertain the highest esteem for him. 
</p><p>
This letter will be delivered to you by Mr. Bayard, who, I 
am happy to inform you, coincides with me in every question 
relative to the peace. He believes with me, if the nation 
can be united in the prosecution of the war, that the interest of 
the United States will be promoted by the failure of the negotiation. He will heartily unite with you in bringing the discussions 
to a close that will secure this great object. I think, from the 
English papers, that no armistice has been agreed upon. I rejoice that it has failed. It might have done us much injury, 
but could not possibly do us any good. God bless you, my dear 
sir, and bless your labors, and make them useful to your country. 
Mine, I believe, are like water spilled on the ground, that can 
never be gathered. Adieu.

</p><p>
My DEAR Sir, - I have but little to add to the contents of my preceding letters. Mr. Gallatin, and the young gentlemen who 
accompany, or follow immediately after him, will give you the ephemeral news of this capital. There is but little doing here which can interest an American citizen. 
</p><p>
I am not sanguine in my expectations of peace. If the failure 
of your exertions, to put an end to the war, shall succeed in producing unanimity at home, we shall have no cause to lament 
that failure. I am thoroughly convinced that the United States 
can never be called upon to treat, under circumstances less auspicious than those which exist at the present moment, unless our 
internal bickerings shall continue to weaken the efforts of the 
Government. I sincerely trust that this will not be the case. In 
your letter to Messrs. Gallatin and Bayard, you state that the 
elections in the East had terminated against the Government, 
but by smaller majorities than on the preceding elections. I 
have not yet received any other information upon the subject, 
than what is contained in that letter. There is a chasm in my 
newspapers, delivered by Mr. Carroll, from the 19th of March to 
the 5th of April. If you can supply this chasm, you will 
greatly oblige me. 
</p><p>
From what I have lately discovered of the councils of this 
nation, and of the temper of the principal maritime states of 
Europe, I am inclined to believe that the time at which they 
may be disposed to oppose the maritime usurpations of our 
enemy, will be more distant than I had previously imagined. 
At all events, I am fearful that it will be more distant than we 
shall be disposed to prosecute the war, to avoid concessions 
which they will feel as severely as we shall. 
</p><p>
In the prosecution of the war, the great difficulty we shall have to encounter, will be the raising of money. The war will 
give us soldiers, and point out the officers qualified to command, but it will neither coin money, or increase our credit. If we 
can get through this campaign without any signal defeat, and without the loss of any of our principal commercial cities, and 
can raise for the ensuing year the sums necessary for the prosecution of the war, we shall find ourselves in much more eligible circumstances at the close of the next campaign, than we are at present. 
</p><p>
I do not look forward with dismay ; I believe we shall rise 
superior to all the difficulties with which we are surrounded. I 
trust we shall live to enjoy many happy celebrations of this anniversary of our national existence. 
</p><p>
Give my best respects to your colleagues, and accept for yourself the assm-ance of my warmest friendship. 
</p><p>
P. S. I will send by Mr. Todd, the passport necessary to 
enable you to come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, after you close your diplomatic 
functions. I repeal my request that you will make my house 
your home, during your residence here. If you wish to take a 
disciple of Pestalozzi with you to the United States, one can be 
obtained. Upon him you can impose the condition of teaching 
the Greek and Latin. You will have, however, to maintain him, 
until he learns English enough to teach. The economy of Switzerland makes this expense very inconsiderable. I have learned 
with great pleasure, from the enemies of the system, that it has 
overcome the prejudices even of the priesthood.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, July 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, - I acknowledge with much pleasure your very 
interesting letter of the 2d instant, by the hands of Mr. Connell. 
</p><p>
It appears that we differ in opinion upon two points. You 
believe that the British Government will not hesitate to make 
peace, leaving the question of impressment wholly out of view. 
You appear also to believe that the events of the present campaign will have a favorable effect upon your negotiation. I 
sincerely wish you may be right, but I am strongly inclined to 
believe that the result will prove your opinions to be incorrect. 
</p><p>
When I foresaw that peace would probably take place in Europe, in the early part of the year, I did not expect that the manner in which the war has terminated would so inflate the 
arrogance of the enemy as it manifestly has done. I thought, 
as you now think, that England would not hesitate to make 
peace hy waiving the question of impressment. I am even now 
convinced that her interest requires that this course should be 
adopted. There are, however, occasions in which nations, like 
individuals, blinded by some momentary but predominant passion, turn a deaf ear to the voice of interest. This I presume to 
be the case with our enemy at the present moment. Various 
facts which have come to my knowledge have led me to believe 
that she will now decidedly reject any proposition which you 
can make, which does not admit the legality of her practice of 
impressment on board American vessels at sea. 
</p><p>
At the moment, however, when I presented to the joint embassy the idea of making peace, by omitting this question, even 
if your instructions did not literally warrant it, I still believed 
that England would consent to this course. At that time I expected the negotiation to open at Gottenburg, about the 1st of 
May. I did not expect that instructions could be received from 
the Government, founded on the recent changes in Europe, before the month of August. At the date of my letter to you of 
the 10th ultimo, my opinion of the views of the British Government had in some degree changed, but even then, I expected the 
negotiation to open a month sooner than it probably will. I also 
expected that the change of the seat of negotiations would probably postpone the receipt of the instructions expected from the 
United States. These reasons, together with those which arise 
from the expectation of a different result from our military 
operations from that which you entertain, aided by the express 
wish of Mr. Bayard that I should present the question anew to 
you individually, must plead my apology for its intrusion upon 
your attention. 
</p><p>
If there was any rational ground to expect that by a longer 
prosecution of the war we should ultimately succeed in compelling the enemy to relinquish, by treaty, the practice of impressment, I would not hesitate to continue the v/ar. I believe there 
is no such reasonable ground of expectation, unless we are disposed to bequeath this war as a legacy to our sons. 
</p><p>
The Russian officers now in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> who have been in England, are highly disgusted with that nation. They speak of a war 
with Austria as certain. In this I think they are mistaken. If 
war breaks out on the continent, I presume England, in her 
present temper, must have a finger in it. In this question, however, as she has no resentments to gratify, she will be governed 
by her interest. She will, therefore, be against that power 
which is most commercial, and the destruction of whose commerce will tend most directly to her interest. 
</p><p>
I must really apologize to you for the length of my letters. 
Present me most respectfully to your colleagues, and accept 
yourself the assurance of my most sincere friendship. 
</p><p>
P. S. Mr. Carroll leaves <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> sooner than I expected. I will 
send your passport by Mr. Todd. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My dear Sir, - The departure of Messrs. Blanchard and Elliot, for Ghent, enables me to send you the passport which I have 
obtained for you. They will be able to give you the ephemeral news of this capital. 
</p><p>
I dined a few days ago in company with the Marquis of Buckinghamshire. We conversed long and freely upon the subject 
of the approaching negotiation. The result of our conversation 
was that there can be no peace. He insists absolutely that the 
question of impressment shall be settled in this treaty, and of 
course, that it shall be settled entirely in their favor. He attempted to derive their right to take (for he insisted upon dropping the word impressment, to which I assented) their seamen from om- vessels, from the law of nations. 
</p><p>
The undersigned, ministers, etc., have the honor of recalling 
to the attention of his B. M. P. the note of the undersigned of 
the 30th ult., and to so much of what has passed in the subsequent conferences as is deemed material to the present communication. 
</p><p>
In that note they stated that they objected to one of the alterations proposed by the B. P. in the first article, and to the modification which they also proposed of the eighth article, of the project which the undersigned had submitted for consideration. 
</p><p>
By the first article of this project, the undersigned had proposed that there should be a mutual restitution of all territories, 
places and possessions, taken by either party during the war, without exception. The alteration in question, proposed by the B. 
P., contemplates a restitution of what belongs to either party. 
The alteration would be free from objection, if there were no 
places in the occupation of either party, which are claimed by 
the other. In that case the execution of the treaty would depend upon the question of who was the possessor at the moment when war was declared. But there are certain islands in 
the Bay of Fundy the title to which is claimed by both parties, 
and other portions of territory from that bay to the Lake of the 
Woods, the whole line between which is more or less liable to dispute, and which may by each party be supposed to belong to him. 
For the settlement of the respective pretensions of the two parties 
to those islands, and for other purposes, a mode of decision, suggested by Great Britain, has been assented to by the undersigned. 
</p><p>
They can not consent to the proposed alteration, first, because 
by constituting each party the sole judge of what belongs to him, 
it makes the restitution to depend upon his uncertain exercise of 
judgment, and not on the precise principle of status before the 
war, on which alone in this respect they have repeatedly stated 
they can treat, and which has been agreed to by Great Britain ; 
and secondly because it is repugnant to the principle on which 
it has been agreed to waive, at this time, the determination of the 
claims of the parties to the disputed islands, and to submit it to 
an impartial tribunal erected for the purpose. These objections 
apply equally to the alteration as proposed in general terms, and 
to the qualification by which it would be limited in its operation to the territories in dispute, or to the islands in Passamaquoddy Bay. It may be added that it is further objectionable as sowing, in the very instrument of pacification, the seeds of an immediate misunderstanding, the moment it is carried into practical execution. 
</p><p>
On the other remaining subject of difference, the undersigned 
must observe that the demand of Great Britain of the navigation 
of the Mississippi, brought forward in the form of a modification 
of the eighth article of the project of the undersigned, was wholly unexpected by them, after the explicit declaration made by 
the British Plenipotentiaries that their Government had no demands to make other than was contained in their notes of the 
, etc., of which this was not one. As to that modification, the undersigned have offered three alternatives, first to strike out 
the article altogether, or to strike out the clause which grants the 
navigation of the Mississippi, or lastly, retaining that clause, to 
place the exercise of the right under restrictions to prevent its 
abuse or perversion, in consideration of the recognition by Great 
Britain of that liberty in the fisheries which she considers abrogated by the war. To either of these alternatives the undersigned are yet willing to assent. And it was with some surprise that they have been made acquainted, by the British Plenipotentiaries, that their Government declines to accept either of 
them, and offers as a substitute for the second, a clause referring 
to a future negotiation the adjustment of the proper equivalent 
to be given by the United States for the enjoyment of the liberty 
to the fisheries referred to ; and of the proper equivalent to be 
given by Great Britain for the navigation of the Mississippi.

The undersigned can not consent to this substitute because 
it is either useless in itself, in providing for a future negotiation 
which the two governments, without any such provision, will at 
all times, if it be necessary, have it in their power to take up ; or 
because it supposes, what the undersigned have declared their 
Government does not admit, that the liberty in the fisheries alluded to has been lost by the war. 
</p><p>
To a general stipulation, similar to the article of the treaty of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>, the undersigned will not object. 
</p><p>
All other points having been substantially arranged either by 
the correspondence, or in the conferences between the Plenipotentiaries of the two countries, it remains only to dispose of 
the two existing topics of difference to conclude, so far as depends on the undersigned, a treaty of peace. For this happy 
result it is quite unnecessary to dwell on the testimony which, in 
every stage of the negotiation, they have constantly given of their anxious desire.

My dear Sir, - Inclosed is a letter for Mr. Poinsett, our 
minister in Mexico, which I will thank you to forward to Mr. Poinsett, with as little delay as is consistent with your convenience. The object of the letter is to obtain from him some of 
the productions of Mexico, which will probably succeed in the Southern and Western States. Perhaps an intimation from the 
Secretary of State on this subject may be productive of good effects.

I hope you know me too well to suppose that I have countenanced the charge of corruption which has been reiterated 
against you. The truth is, I approved of your vote for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="met colleague">Mr. Adams</a>], when it was given ; and should have voted as you did, 
between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met colleague">Jackson</a>] and Adams. But candor compels me to say, that I disapproved of your accepting an office from him. You ought, I think, to have foreseen that his administration could 
hardly fail to be popular. Those who knew his temper, disposition, and political opinions, entertained no doubt upon the 
subject. By accepting the office of Secretary of State from him, you have indisputably connected your fortunes with his. 
And it appears to me that he is destined to fall as his father did, 
and you must fall with him. This State could not have been driven under the banners of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met colleague">Jackson</a>] by any other course of 
measures than that pursued by the Administration toward it. Jr. Adams' general measures, although very exceptionable, would not have ranged the State under <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met colleague">Jackson's</a>] standard. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="met colleague">Mr. Adams</a>] has professed to consider the Federal Government limited by the enumerated powers. Yet he has recommended to Congress to erect light-houses to the skies - a recommendation 
utterly inconsistent with the idea of the Government being limited by the enumerated powers. This recommendation, it 
appears to me, can be supported by no other construction than that Congress can do any thing which is not expressly forbidden 
by the Constitution. The whole of his first message to Congress is replete with doctrines which I hold to be unconstitutional. 
</p><p>
Present my respects to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met aquaintance">Mrs. Clay</a>, and accept the same yourself.
