JAMES B. CLAY TO HIS FATHER. 

Lisbon, May 26, 1850. 

My dear Father, - You can not imagine in what a state of 
uncertainty, uneasiness, and expectation, we have been during this entire month. I had been informed by Mr. Clayton that it 
was the opinion of the Secretary of the Navy that the ship from 
the Mediterranean, with my final instructions, would reach here 
by the 1st of this month, and it is now nearly the last, and it 
has not arrived. I have seen by the English papers that the 
storeship Erie, which, I presume, took Commodore Morgan his 
orders, was lying, with the commodore, in the harbor of Naples, 
on the 27th last month, in fifteen days after he ought to have 
been here ; why he is not, God only knows. I have been constantly uneasy for fear that his non-arrival might prejudice the 
settlement of our affairs ; and if this Government had a grain of 
common sense, it would have done so very much. Their true 
policy, having determined not to pay, was most certainly to offer 
an arbitration of all the claims, and I have been every instant 
fearing that such an offer would be made ; a rejection of it, which 
I would have to make, would, of course, have put us in a worse 
position before the world. 

The English Charge, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=geh" rel="met colleague">Mr. Howard</a>, the brother of the Earl of 
Carlisle, told me the other day, that Mr. Bulwer had written to 
Lord Palmerston, as he promised you, to advise these people to 
pay all the claims which were just, and to offer to arbitrate the 
others ; and I presume he did so, for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=geh" rel="met colleague">Mr. Howard</a> told me, at 
the same time, that Count Fayal had informed him that he had 
offered to arbitrate all. This impression he has been for some 
time trying to create, through the papers and otherwise. You 
may have seen an article in " The London Times" speaking of 
my rejection of the offer, etc. ; this, I know, was denied from 
Fayal, who shows everything to the correspondent of that paper. 
Lord Palmerston has very little influence here. He has been 
always opposed to the Cabral Ministry, and there is no goodwill 
between them. I took occasion to inform <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=geh" rel="met colleague">Mr. Howard</a>, that it 
was wholly untrue that Count Fayal had offered to arbitrate all 
our claims, and said that I had no objection to his so informing 
his Government. 

I can not predict what will be the effect produced by the 
coming of the ship, if ever she does arrive, or of my demand for 
my passport, if they don't pay. Our action has, throughout the 
affair, been so dilatory, that I am sure it can not have so great 
influence as promptness would have done. It has always been 
my opinion that I ought to have been sent here in a ship of war, 
 

with the same instructions given at last. Our position at the 
time of my arrival was by all odds better than it is now. 

Should we be suffered to go away, I am undetermined whether 
we shall go to Naples and to Paris, through Italy and Switzerland, or go at once to Paris. I shall be determined by Commodore Morgan's course. If he offers to take us to Naples, as it wiU 
not be out of his way, I shall accept. If we go that way, we 
will still reach America in November. 

As the season has arrived for Southerners to be in Kentucky, 
perhaps my house could now be sold. I should like it to be ; 
as on our return home, if you won't sell me Ashland, I am determined to try and buy Crutch field's place on the Ohio. Can you 
write to Trotter or Pindell about the house ? 

28th. - Commodore Morgan has not arrived, and I am in hourly 
expectation of receiving, what I feared I should receive, a proposition to arbitrate all the claims. I dined last night with the 
Duke of Leuchtenberg, the son-in-law of the Emperor of Russia, 
at the Russian Legation, when the Minister asked if I had received such a proposition, as Count Fayal had told him he intended to make it. He seemed surprised when I told him I had 
not. I shall regret to receive it, because I think my instructions 
will oblige me to reject it, and I know it will place us in a worse 
position before the world. Either Commodore Morgan has had 
orders of which I was not informed, or he has not been as active 
as he might, and ought to have been. 

Nine o'clock at night. - I have just received a note from the 
Minister, stating the willingness of his Government to arbitrate 
all the claims, but as he rejects the last of them in the same note, 
and as his language is not a distinct proposition to arbitrate, I 
shall not so consider it. 

We are all well, and Susan joins me in affectionate love to 
you.
