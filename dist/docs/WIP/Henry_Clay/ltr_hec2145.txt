[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hec" rel="me">MR. CLAY</a>] TO <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ftb" rel="colleague friend met">FRANCIS BROOKE</a>. 
</p><p>
Haedin's, near Charlottesville, Virginia, November 26,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, I felt, in your prompt public contradiction of 
the letter of Mr. Dayton, stating that my name had been withdrawn as a candidate for the Presidency, a new proof of your 
friendship, which I have ever so highly valued, and at the same 
time a self-reproach for my not having written to you since the 
adjournment of Congress. The truth is, that in the first letter 
which I received from you, after I reached home, you stated 
your intention to visit the watering places, and I did not well 
know where to address you ; and the last which you did me the 
favor to write, was received but a few days before I sat out on 
this journey. I concluded, therefore, to defer the pleasure of 
writing you until I passed the mountains. 
</p><p>
Your prediction has been well nigh verified as to General 
Jackson's taking the Western vote from me. My friends have 
prevailed over him in Ohio by only about seven or eight hundred votes. 
</p><p>
Events on this side of the mountains have surprised me, particularly in New York, and North Carolina ; in the former State 
especially. I know not the secret springs which have produced 
such a strange result as has occurred in New York. I have 
moved none of them. I know nothing but what we see in the 
public prints. From those it is evident, that, if the friends of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> and myself had all amicably co-operated, the vote 
of that State might have been secured to one or the other, or been divided between us. I am uninformed of what prevented that contest. 
</p><p>
I propose visiting <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> to-morrow, and afterward 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison</a>. I shall remain a day or two with each of them, 
and expect to reach  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> on my way to the city of 
 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, on the 2d or 3d of December.
