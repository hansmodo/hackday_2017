My dear Sir, â€” T have received your obliging favor of the 
29th instant. The considerations were so many and so powerful, calling upon your State to ratify the convention with Kentucky, that I confess to you frankly I did not anticipate the 
event which you say will probably happen. In that event I 
shall deeply regret that Virginia ever again opened the negotiation, after respecting the professions which Mr. Bibb and I submitted to your Legislature last winter. Why did Virginia ask 
a reference of the claim of her State limit? Could she suppose 
that Kentucky would refer it and leave herself exposed, after the 
decision of the referees, to the claim, as if it had never been 
submitted to arbitration? Could she think that the mockery of 
creating a tribunal was to be presented to decide a controversy, 
respecting which the parties were to be as free and unbound after 
the decision as before the reference. If she had no power to 
refer ; if she had no authority to bind her constituents, then she 
ought not to have moved in the business; and the first error was 
committed at Richmond, and not at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. For my part 
I believe the State line hound by the decision, and that the 
guaranty is the mere expression of a fair implication from the 
whole transaction without it. And it was only to render the 
convention more explicit, and to preclude the necessity of resorting to any interpretations about which disputes might arise, that 
it appeared to me to be expedient to insert the clause of guaranty. 
Upon the whole I must say, that if you reject the convention, 
</p><p>
I think the impartial world will look upon you as being clearly 
in the wrong. 
</p><p>
I am extremely sorry to find that any of my friends believe 
that I was not called upon to address the note which was recently published in the Intelligencer, respecting certain questions 
arising at Ghent. Had <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, either before or after his 
several publications, designed to consult me about the use which 
he has freely made in them of my name ; had he said to me " Mr. 
Clay, I have imputed to you such and such opinions, and made 
statements about the part you acted at Ghent ; if I am inaccurate in any of them I will take pleasure in correcting the error," 
I should have felt myself required to address <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> personally, and not the public. But he never communicated to me 
any one of his publications, and I never had an opportunity even 
of seeing his book until my arrival here. Having chosen, without my knowledge or consent, to usher my name into the public 
journals ; having imputed to me, as he does in his appendix, inconsistencies, and by an innuendo insinuated that I was the author 
of an editorial article in Kentucky, which I never saw until I 
read it in the paper in which it was printed, I felt myself absolved from all obligation to make any direct appeal to Mr. 
Adams himself. In addressing the note which I did to the public, it was my intention merely to enter a caveat against the correctness of all his statements, and to exhibit a public reservation 
of a right on my part to rectify mistakes, when the proper occasion should arrive. Considering the relation in which both of 
us now stand to the public, I thought the present an unsuitable 
moment even to hazard any controversy with him ; and if I 
could prostrate him in the dust I would not write at this time. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind information respecting the state of 
the public mind in Virginia.
</p><p>
I look upon this struggle with all the philosophy which I ought 
to do. On one resolution my friends may rest assured I will 
firmly rely, and that is, to participate in no intrigues, to enter 
into no arrangements, to make no promises or pledges ; but that, 
whether I am elected or not, I will have nothing to reproach 
myself with. If elected I will go into the office with a pure 
conscience, to promote with my utmost exertions the common 
good of our country, and free to select the most able and faithful 
public servants. If not elected, acquiescing most cheerfully in 
the better selection which will thus have been made, I will atleast have the satisfaction of preserving my honor unsuihed, and my heart uncorriipted. 
</p><p>
I shall remain here during the greater part of the term of the 
Supreme Court, in which I have some professional business, particularly the cause between the bank and the State of Ohio. 
</p><p>
I shall be glad that your leisure may allow you to give me 
the pleasure of again hearing from you. 
</p><p>
P. S. What course does Virginia mean to take after refuting 
the guaranty? Does she intend again to open the negotiation? 
To propose that the Board of Commissioners shall now proceed 
without the clause of guaranty? Or to make a rupture of all 
negotiations and fly to arms? I mean forensic arms.
