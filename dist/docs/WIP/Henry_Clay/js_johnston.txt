Dear Sir, - There is little feeling in New England for Adams. The ultra Federalists hate him, the moderate feel indifference, the 
Republicans are not cordial. He is supported merely on sectional grounds. But strange - the ultras will join the radicals - the extremes meet. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="">General Lafayette</a> has been received with distinguished honors, and departed this morning for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. His whole journey will be a procession. What a glorious reward ! I shall 
leave here in a few days for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, where I think it important to be.

Dear Sir, - I now hand you the letter of General M'Clure which I promised you in my last, when I handed you the printed letter. 
</p><p>
I purposely avoided seeing General M'Clure at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, satisfied 
it was better for Rochester to communicate with him than me, 
and that the objects and views of your friends are better accomplished by a corresponding committee. Besides, I was told your friends were as firm and stanch as was necessary ; and, from the tone and tenor of this letter, I have no doubt. I will now write 
to all of them, and let them understand distinctly the views taken of the state of your interests in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>.

Dear Sir, - I attended a meeting of your friends, to wit, Mr. 
Carey and son, Mr. Hemphill, Mr. Tilman, Mr. Wharton, Dr. Chapman, Dr. Godman, Mr. Edward Ingersoll, etc., to consult 
about the meeting of your friends. It was called without their 
knowledge. They determined to postpone the meeting until 
this day week. Mr. Carey consents to be chairman. A committee of correspondence will be organized, and delegates appointed. I have no doubt the meeting will be numerous and respectable. This State might have been secured at a proper 
time, and this State would have secured you. Your affairs have 
been trusted to providence. I send you two letters from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. 
I hope you have received General M'Clure's. 
I The friends of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Crawford</a> are still very anxious to make you 
Vice-President. Mr. Elliot often speaks of it ; it is much a subject of correspondence among them. They count confidently 
upon most of your votes in that event. They say <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alg" rel="colleague">Gallatin</a> would not be in the way.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, - I have read with pleasure and with attention your favor of the 10th September. We agree in every particular with 
regard to the Vice-Presidency. You can not change your position, and your friends are not disposed. You must abide the 
issue. I have uniformly given the same reply. It was a strange idea of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Crawford's</a> friends to count on the Western States by 
your withdrawal. I have often explained that to them ; they now see and feel the truth. The object of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Crawford's</a> friends 
now will be to put down Adams, and, if possible, to prevent his being returned, under the idea that his being withdrawn, the New England States will vote for him. 
</p><p>
We receive <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="">General Lafayette</a> to-morrow. The concourse of 
people here is very great. The preparations are very expensive and very grand. 
</p><p>
I presume he will be received by both Houses in the center building. 
</p><p>
There is no idea of making him Vice-President.

My dear Sir, - We have been greatly shocked to-day by the sudden and unexpected death of Mrs. Brown. She expired 
about eleven o'clock, without the slightest pain or suffering, and probably without any consciousness of the approaching event. 
The disease which has proved so instantaneously fatal was water in the chest, which had been gradually increasing and rendering 
her respiration more difficult. The collection of water burst and extinguished life in a moment. She drove out on Saturday as 
well as usual ; saw several of her friends on Sunday evening, and did not retire until eleven. Monday she was not so well, 
and for the first time kept her room ; she slept well Monday night, and until late in the morning ; had her breakfast at nine ; 
said she was much better, and would dress and go down stairs. Mr. Brown went to the reading-room as usual. Doctor La Roche 
was with her ten minutes before, and left her without apprehension. She expired so easily, that Miss Brown supposed she had 
fainted. Mr. Brown has been greatly distressed. They had just established themselves in their new house. Mrs. Brown 
supposed she had the asthma, and that she might live as her father had done for many years. On Saturday she selected a 
lot to build on. This event, painful as it is to Mr. Brown and his friends, is most happy for her in the manner of it. She has 
been spared all the anticipations of death, which she seemed to put far away from her. 
</p><p>
All the arrangements are made for the funeral, which will be numerously attended. Mrs. Brown is a great loss to the city, 
and her death has made a great sensation. I returned last evening from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. 
</p><p>
I have been with Mr. Brown this evening, and he is more composed. Miss Susan will write <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="friend met">Mrs. Clay</a> as soon as she can ; 
in the mean time they both request me to write you, which I have done in great haste.
