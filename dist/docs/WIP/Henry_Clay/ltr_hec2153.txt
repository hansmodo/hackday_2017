 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, February 18,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, When the subject of the offer of the Department of State to me was first opened to my congressional friends, 
there existed among them some diversity of opinion as to the propriety of my accepting it. On the one hand, it was said that, 
if I took it, that fact would be treated as conclusive evidence of 
the justice of the imputations which have been made against 
me ; that the House of Representatives was my theater ; that 
the administration would want me there, if it should prove itself 
worthy of support, more than in the cabinet ; and that my own 
section would not like to see me translated from the legislative 
hall to the executive departments. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, it was urged that, whether I accepted or 
declined the office, I should not escape severe animadversion ; 
that, in the latter contingency, it would be said that the patriotic 
Mr. Kremer, by an exposure of the corrupt arrangement, had 
prevented its consummation ; that the very object of propagating 
the calumny would be accomplished ; that, conscious of my own 
purity of intentions, I ought not to give the weight of a feather 
to Mr. Kremer's affair ; that there would be much difficulty in 
filling the administration without me ; that either of the other 
candidates, if he had been elected, would have made me the 
same offer ; that it would be said of me that, after having contributed to the election of a President, I thought so ill of him, 
that I would not take the first place under him ; that he was 
now the constitutional head of the Government, and, as such, I 
ought to regard him, dismissing any personal objections which I 
might have heretofore had to him ; that I had, perhaps, remained 
long enough in the House of Representatives ; and that my own 
section could not be dissatisfied with seeing me placed where, 
if I should prove myself possessed of the requisite attainments, 
my services might have a more extended usefulness. 
</p><p>
On mature consideration, those of my friends who were 
originally averse to my entering the office, changed their 
opinion, and I believe they were finally unanimous in thinking 
that I ought not to hesitate in taking upon myself its duties. 
Those of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>, especially in New England, were alike 
unanimous, and indeed extremely urgent in their solicitations. 
Several of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> friends (Mr. McLane, of Delaware, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a>e, Mr. Mangum, etc., etc.), and also some of those of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, in Pennsylvania, have expressed to me their 
strong convictions that I ought to accept. The opposition to 
my acceptance is limited chiefly to the violence of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>'s 
friends, and to some of those of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. 
</p><p>
From the first, I determined to throw myself into the hands 
of my friends, and if they advised me to decline the office, not 
to accept it, but if they thought it was my duty, and for the 
public interest, to go into it, to do so. I have an unaffected repugnance to any executive employment, and my rejection of the 
offer, if it were in conformity to their deliberate judgment, would 
have been more compatible with my feelings, than its acceptance. 
</p><p>
But as their advice to me is to accept, I have resolved 
accordingly, and I have just communicated my final determination to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. I am not yet at liberty to communicate the names of the persons who will fill the other vacant 
departments ; but I will say to you, that they will be Republicans. 
I entertain a strong belief, and sanguine hopes, that the administration will be conducted upon principles which will entitle it to 
liberal and general support. An opposition is talked of here ; 
but I regard that as the ebullition of the moment, the natural 
offspring of chagrin and disappointment. There are elements 
for faction ; none for opposition. Opposition to what? To 
measures and principles which are yet to be developed ! Opposition may follow, it can not precede the unknown measures of 
administration, without incurring the denomination of faction. 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> is on his trial. Hear him, and then decide. This is 
the natural sentiment of every candid and impartial mind. He 
would not have been my President, if I had been allowed to 
range at large among the great mass of our citizens, to select a 
President ; but I was not so allowed, and circumscribed as I was, 
I thought that, under all circumstances, he was the best choice 
that I could practicably make. 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of the 16th instant, and I am happy 
to find that your better judgment points to the course which I 
am about to take. I hope that, on further reflection, my other 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> friends will probably unite in sentiment with you. 
</p><p>
This is not written for publication in whole, or in part, but I 
request you to show it to Mr. Call, Mr. Leigh, and Mr. Ritchie, 
who will have the goodness to regard it in the same confidential 
light.
