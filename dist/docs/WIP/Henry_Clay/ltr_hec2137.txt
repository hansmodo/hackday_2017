Dear Sir, I transmit you the inclosed just as I have received 
it. The person who writes it (and whose acquaintance I would 
like you to make, if convenient) became known to me at Columbus, in Ohio, in January,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1823">1823</a>. He traveled with Judge Burnett and myself from that place to Wheeling, and interested us 
both by the variety and extent of his information, particularly in 
regard to characters now on the stage. He subsequently manifested a good deal of zeal in my behalf, and has frequently written me letters, to which I have sometimes replied, respectfully but cautiously. If the communication from Mr. is to be considered in the nature of an overture, there can be but one 
answer given. I can make no promises of office, of any sort, to 
any one, upon any condition whatever. Whatever support shall 
be given to me, if any, must be spontaneous and unbought. I can not but believe that Mr. 's friend must have allowed 
his zeal to cary him further than was authorized. 
</p><p>
We have nothing new in this quarter. All that we believed 
in respect to the favorable disposition toward me is well founded. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to make my best respects to Mrs. Johnston. .

N. B. The endorsement on the letter, supposed to be by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsj" rel="colleague friend met">Mr. Johnston</a>, is â€” " Mi. wanted a foreign embassy."
