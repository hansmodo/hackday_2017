My dear Sir, My position, in regard to the Presidential 
election, is highly critical, and such as to leave me no path on 
which I can move without censure. I have pursued, in regard 
to it, the rule which I always observe in the discharge of my public duty â€” I have interrogated my conscience as to what I ought 
to do, and that faithful guide tells me that I ought to vote for 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. I shall fulfill its injunction. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> state 
of health, and the circumstances under which he presents himself to the House, appear to me to be conclusive against him. 
As a friend of liberty, and to the permanence of our institutions, 
I can not consent, in this early stage of their existence, by contributing to the election of a military chieftain, to give the 
strongest guaranty that the Republic will march in the fatal 
road which has conducted every other republic to ruin. I owe 
to our friendship this frank exposition of my intentions. I am, 
and shall continue to be, assailed by all the abuse, which partisan zeal, malignity, and rivalry, can invent. I shall risk, without emotion, these effusions of malice, and remain unshaken in 
, my purpose. What is a public man worth, if he will not expose himself, on fit occasions, for the good of his country? 
</p><p>
As to the result of the election, I can not speak with absolute 
certainty; but there is every reason to believe that we shall 
avoid the dangerous precedent to which I allude. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to give my respects to Mr. , and believe me 
</p><p>
always your cordial friend.
