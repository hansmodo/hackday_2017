My dear Sir, I duly received your friendly letter of the 19th inst., as I did the preceding one to which it refers. The course 
which the business between our respective States has taken, fills 
me with so much regret and concern, that I will not dwell upon 
it, especially as it has probably terminated finally, and had, therefore better be forgotten as soon as it can be. What is done can 
not be changed, and it is not conformable to my temper or habit, 
to indulge in unavailing regrets. I prefer always looking to the 
future. I observe vv^hat you state with respect to the condition 
of the public feeling in Virginia, in regard to the next Presidency. 
I ever thought that the line of conduct which the Virginia gentleman had marked out for that State, that is, to take no forward 
part in the ensuing election, but rather to leave the decision of 
it to the residue of the Union, was wise and discreet. It would 
have been thought that Virginia was dictatorial, if after ceasing 
to furnish a chief magistrate, she should have displayed any early 
and anxious solicitude about the successor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="">Mr. Monroe</a>. But 
has Virginia acted in consonance with this avowed purpose? Has 
not that point, which heretofore has invariably indicated her pleasure, distinctly taken its ground? Has it not been confidently proclaimed, and been believed, every where out of Virginia, that her 
choice was fixed? May not the effect of all this be, to jeopardize, not only that preference, if it be actually made, but also the 
election of him who would be her second choice? 
</p><p>
Virginia may possibly decide the election by bestowing her suffrage on the gentleman referred to, though I doubt it extremely. 
But she certainly can decide it by lending her support to him 
who is said to be her second choice. She will, of course, as she 
ought to, determine as she pleases in such contingencies.
</p><p>
In saying that it is my firm conviction that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> is at 
present the most formidable, I pray you to believe that I do not 
mean (far from it), to indicate any preference for him, nor am I moved, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford's</a> expense, by the desire of advancing 
my own interests.
</p><p>
Connect yourselves with the West, and are you not, whether 
the election is won or lost, on the vantage ground? You see, 
my dear sir, that I write you with all the freedom of an ancient 
friendship, which could alone excuse the presentation to you of 
views, which, I dare say, have often been taken by you. 
</p><p>
I pray you to give my best respects to your associate, Judge 
Green, whose acquaintance I had the pleasure of making last 
winter, and for whose character I have a high regard. '
