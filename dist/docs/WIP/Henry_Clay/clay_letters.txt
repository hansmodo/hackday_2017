I need make no further apology for calling your recollection to the 
handbill that was shown in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a> last November, implicating 
my political principles as inimical to Mr. Jefferson and republicanism. From an application to Mr. Taylor and others who 
were present, it appears that the conversation alluded to took 
place principally between you and myself, although in presence 
of several gentlemen. I wish you now to recollect, as far as you 
can, the nature of that conversation in what manner I spoke of 
the amendment to the Federal Constitution, whether positively 
as bad, or whether I did not merely doubt its future operation as 
unfavorable to republicanism, stating, as my reason, that it had 
beeii urged by the Federalists under the former Administration, 
and opposed by the party who had now carried it in opposition 
to them. 1 wish you likewise to state in what manner and by 
whom General Pinckney's name was first introduced, whether I 
discovered the least displeasure with the administration, or talents, or personal character of Mr. Jefferson ; on the contrary, 
whether I did not say I would prefer him as President to any 
man in the Union ; but observed that the people of America 
ought not to think their liberty or happi;iess depended on the 
election of any individual, but on their steady adherence to a 
virtuous observance of their laws. 

Your answer by post to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a> will be deemed a favor.

Dear Sir, Information has this morning been given to me 
that Mr. Davies has recommenced his prosecution and inquiry. 
I must entreat your professional aid in this business. It would 
be disagreeable to me to form a new connection, and various 
considerations will, it is hoped, induce you, even at some personal inconvenience, to acquiesce in my request. I shall, however, 
insist on making a liberal pecuniary compensation. The delay 
of your journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> for a few days can not be very 
material. No business is done in Congress till after New Years. 
I pray you to repair to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a> on receipt of this. 



AARON BURR TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a>, December 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1806">1806</a>. 

Sir, I have no design, nor have I taken any measure to promote a dissolution of the Union, or a separation of any one or 
more States from the residue. I have neither published a line 
on this subject nor has any one, through my agency, or with my 
knowledge. I have no design to intermeddle with the Government or to disturb the tranquillity of the United States, or of its 
territories, or any part of them. I have neither issued, nor signed, 
nor promised a commission to any person for any purpose. I do 
not own a musket nor a bayonet, nor any single article of military stores, nor does any person for me, by my authority or with 
my knowledge. 

My views have been fully explained to, and approved by, several of the principal officers of Government, and, I believe, are 
well understood by the administration and seen by it with complacency. They are such as every man of honor and every 
good citizen must approve. 

Considering the high station you now fill in our national councils* I have thought these explanations proper, as well to counteract the chimerical tales which malevolent persons have so industriously circulated, as to satisfy you that you have not espoused the cause of a man in any way unfriendly to the laws, 
the government, or the interests of his country. 



AARON BURR TO MR. CLAY. 

Lewis Inn, half past 3. 

Sir, At nine this morning Mr. Jordan received your letter in 
reply to one which he wrote at my request. 

I have just arrived wet, and something fatigued, and send to 
inquire whether my presence in court is noiv deemed necessary 
or expedient. 

I pray you to consider yourself as my counsel in the business 
moved by Mr. D. A more technical application will be made 
when I shall have the pleasure to see you. An early interview, 
at this house, would very much gratify me. 



MR. CLAY TO .* 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, July 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1811">1811</a>. 
Dear Sir, In acknowledging the receipt of your favor of 
the 7th inst., covering 1,100 for the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> Library, I must 
say you have furnished, what was not wanted, an additional 
evidence of that devotion to literature, and that disinterested 
liberality, which you have invariably so eminently displayed. 
I fear that, in this instance, your munificence has exceeded the 
bounds of self-justice, by the appropriation of a sum not warranted by the proceeds of the orations, with which you have 
favored us. Under this impression, I was about to obey my first 
impulse of soliciting you to permit me to return your benevolent 
donation. But apprehensive that, in so doing, I might excite 
some unpleasant sensation, I determined to give it the direction 
which your goodness has prescribed, and invest it in such of the 
books contained in your list, as are not already in the Library, 
which will be not more appreciated for their enlightened contents than by a recollection of the distinguished source whence 
they have proceeded. 



LANGDON CHEVES TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> (Davis' Hotel), July 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1812">1812</a>. 

Dear Sir, Yours of the 15th July, inst., I received yesterday, 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, at the very moment I was getting into the stage 
on my way to Carolina. * ^ * * * 

You ask me, " What notice you ought to take of Randolph's 
reply ?" certainly none none whatever. Were you to notice 
it he would reply again, and it would never terminate. He 
spoke with great truth in the beginning of the last session, when 
he said the " Speaker of the House of Representatives was the 
second man in the nation ;" and if this be true, as I think it is, 
it does not become the Speaker to enter into altercations with 
any member of the House, or even of the nation, in a public 

* The address of this letter is not given. 
 

justification of his conduct, any more than it does to the first 
man in the nation the President. I, therefore, thought you 
originally wrong. But if any notice of Mr. R.'s first puhlication 
was right, it was taken by you exactly in the manner, temperate 
and dignified, in which it ought to have been noticed. I think, 
as the question stands, you have entirely the advantage of the 
argument ; and I think you would egregiously err, as the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives (it would be entirely 
different were it a question between Mr. Clay and Mr. R.) to put 
it on any other footing than that of argument. I have not heard 
one sentence on the subject of his reply, of any kind, from any 
person, except one in my own family, which resulted from my 
having received a copy of it, through the Post-office, from himself it was not one to your prejudice. On this subject, although 
about the latitude of debate we differ, I am entirely and decidedly 
of opinion you are right ; and that, I think, is enough for you 
as Speaker. I am sure of this, whether you think me right or 
wrong, you will be certain that I give you candid advice. 

I have not a doubt of your willingness to put the question 
personally on any footing whatever, that might be deemed proper. 
But any such notice of it on your part would be most inexcusably 
wrojig. It is always to be remembered that it is the Speaker 
and Mr. R. who are engaged ; and really I should be afraid myself of the freedom of speech, if the Chair were supported in that 
way. No ; if you had any feelings leading you that way, it 
would be a sacred public duty to suppress them. I ought to 
have said, besides, that there is not even a plausible reason and 
occasion for any such notice were you viewed merely as any 
other individual of the community. Present my most respectful 
compliments to Mrs. Clay. I have only arrived here fifteen 
minutes, and go away on my journey in fifteen more. I am, 
therefore, in great haste. 



JAMES MONROE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, August 28, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1812">1812</a>. 
Mt Dear Sir, ^Yours of the 29th ultimo and 12th instant 
have been received. The former should have been answered 
sooner, had I not been absent in Virginia, where I had gone to 
to take my family for the advantage of our mountain air. 

We have just heard with equal astonishment and concern, that 
General Hall has surrendered, by capitulation, the army under 
his command at Detroit, to the British force opposed to him. 
The circumstances attending this most mortifying and humiliating event are not known ; but, so far as we are informed on the 
subject, there appears to be no justification of it. I can not 
suspect his integrity ; I rather suppose that a panic had seized 
the whole force, and that he and they became victims of his 
want of energy, promptitude of decision, and those resources, the 
characteristics of great minds in difficult emergencies. We understand that, after passing the river, he suffered his communication 
to be cut off with the States of Ohio and Kentucky, and without 
making any active movement in front to strike terror into the 
enemy, he remained tranquil, thereby evincing a want of confidence in his own means, and giving time to collect his forces 
together. No intelligence justifies the belief that he gave battle 
in a single instance. It appears that he surrendered on a summons from Fort Sandwich, on the opposite side of the river, after 
the firing of some cannon or mortars, which did no great mischief. 

Before this disastrous event was known, the force, now, I presume, on its march, was ordered from Kentucky, and the appointment of brigadier had been conferred on Governor Harrison. 
Your letters had produced all the effect on those subjects, which 
their solidity justly merited. 

I most sincerely wish that the President could dispose of me, 
at this juncture, in the military line. If circumstances would 
permit, and it should be thought that I could render any service, 
I would, in a very few days, join our forces assembling beyond 
the Ohio, and endeavor to recover the ground v/hich we have 
lost. He left this to-day for Virginia, as did Mr. Gallatin for 
New York, but expresses being sent for them, they will probably 
both return to-morrow. 



WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, August 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1812">1812</a>. 

I write to you, my dear sir, amid a thousand interruptions, 
and I do it solely for the purpose of showing you that you 
are present to my recollection, under circumstances that would 
almost justify a suspension of every private feeling. The rumored disasters upon our north-western frontier, are now ascertained to be correct. The important point of Mackinac was surrendered without an effort; an army captured at Detroit, after 
receiving three shots from a distant battery of the enemy (and 
from the range of which it was easy to retire), a fort [Chicago], 
in the midst of hostile tribes of Indians, ordered to be evacuated, and the garrison slaughtered ; the numerous north-western 
tribes of Indians (with the exception of two feeble ones), in 
arms against us, is the distressing picture which presents itself 
to view in this part of the country. To remedy all these 
misfortunes, I have an army competent in numbers, and in spirit 
equal to any that Greece or Rome ever boasted of, but destitute of artillery, of many necessary equipments, and absolutely 
ignorant of every military evolution, nor have I but a single 
individual capable of assisting me in training them. But I beg 
you to believe, my dear sir, that this retrospect of .my situation, 
far from producing despondency, produces a contrary effect, and 
I feel confident of being able to surmount them all. The 
grounds of this ccinfidence are a reliance on my own zeal and 
perseverance, and a perfect conviction that no such materials 
for forming an invincible army ever existed, as the volunteers 
which have marched from Kentucky on the present occasion. 

Fort Wayne is in imminent danger. Governor Meiggs is collecting a body of mounted men arUrbanna, and I suppose wiU 
send them to relieve Fort Wayne, before I can get up with the 
infantry, I dispatched Garrard's troop this morning, with orders 
to join any corps (at Piqua) which may be destined for that 
object. The three regiments of infantry marched also this 
morning ; I shall follow and overtake them to-morrow. Should 
the relief of Fort Wayne not have been attempted, or the 
attempt have failed, it will be my first object upon my arrival at 
Piqua. I have made every arrangement in my power to facilitate the march of the regiments which are expected from Kentucky, after they shall arrive here, but I fear that I shall be 
obliged to advance from Piqua without them. With the assistance of a number of mounted men, however, which Governor 
Meiggs can supply, I may do pretty well. With troops that are 
awkward, and who, of course, maneuver slowly, mounted men 
are absolutely indispensable to mask their evolutions. 

I am so much interrupted, that I can only add that I am your 
friend, etc. 



WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, August 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1812">1812</a>. 

My Dear Sir, After having been absent from home for so 
many months you will no doubt think it unreasonable that you 
should be asked to take a considerable journey, and that on an 
occasion entirely foreign to your ordinary public duties. I know 
you, however, too well, not to believe that sacrifices of private 
convenience will be always made to render service to your 
country. Without farther preamble then, I inform you that 
in my opinion, your presence on the frontier of this State 
would be productive of great advantages, I can assure you 
that your advice and assistance in determining the course of 
operations for the army (to the command of which I have 
been designated by your recommendation), will be highly useful. You are not only pledged in some manner for my conduct, but for the success of the war for God's sake, then, come on to Piqua as quickly as possible, and let us endeavor to throw 
off from the administration that weight of reproach which the 
late disasters will heap upon them. If you come, bring on 
McKee with you, whom you will overtake upon the road. An 
extract from this letter will be authority for the commanding 
officer of his regiment to let him come. 



JAMES MONROE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, September l*/, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1812">1812</a>. 
My DEAR Sir, I have had the pleasure to receive several letters from you in relation to our affairs to the westward, and I 
hope that one which I wrote you on the receipt of the first, has 
long since reached its destination. Every effort has been made 
by the government to remedy the shameful and disastrous loss 
of the army and fort at Detroit, and I hope the best effects will 
result from them. In aid of the force which has so generously 
volunteered its service from Kentucky and Ohio, fifteen hundred 
are ordered from Pennsylvania, and a like number from Virginia, 
so that I think you will have on the borders of Lake Erie, early 
in the next month, eight thousand or ten thousand men, well 
equipped, prepared to march on to recover the ground lost, and resume the conquest of Upper Canada. I have the utmost confidence in the success of the expedition which is set on foot, because the spirit of the people appears to be roused to that state 
which is best adapted to manly and heroic achievements. I am 
willing to trust to their sense of honor and to their patriotism, to 
efface the stigma which has been fixed on our national character. 
I hope they will exhibit a noble contrast to that degenerate spirit 
which has of late, and continues to exhibit itself to the eastward, 
in the dominant party there. The command of this force is committed to Governor Harrison, who, it is believed, will justify the 
favorable expectation entertained of him by those who are best 
acquainted with his merit. You and our other friends in Kentucky will find that the utmost attention has been paid to your 
opinions and wishes on all these subjects. 

A large park of heavy artillery is sent on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, to be 
forwarded thence toward Cleveland, for the use of the army, 
whose duty it will be to retake Detroit, and expel the British 
from Maiden and Upper Canada. In short, every arrangement is 
made to give effect to our operations in that quarter that has appeared to be necessary. 

On the intelligence of the surrender of Detroit, the President 
expressed a desire to avail himself of my services in that quarter, 
and had- partly decided so to do. He proposed that I should go 
in the character of a volunteer, with the rank of major general, 
to take the command of the forces. I expressed my willingness 
to obey the summons, although it was sudden and unexpected, 
as indeed the event which suggested the idea was. On mature 
reflection, however, he concluded that it would not be proper for 
me to leave my present station at the present juncture. I had no 
opinion on the subject, but was prepared to act in any situation 
in which it might be thought I might be most useful. 

From the northern army we have nothing which inspires a 
confident hope of any brilliant success. The disaffection in that 
quarter has paralyzed every effort of the government, and rendered inoperative every law of Congress ; I speak comparatively 
with what might have been expected. On the public mind, 
however, a salutary effect is produced even there, by the events 
which have occurred. Misfortune and success have alike diminished the influence of foreign attachments and party animosities, 
and contributed to draw the people closer together. The surrender of our army excited a general grief, and the naval victory a 
general joy. Inveterate Toryism itself was compelled, in both 
instances, to disguise its character and hide its feehngs, by appearing to sympathize with those of the nation. If Great Britain 
does not come forward soon and propose honorable conditions, I 
am convinced that the war will become a national one, and will 
terminate in the expulsion of her force and power from the continent. 

Should you see my old and venerable friend, General Scott, I 
beg you to present my best regards to him. 



MR. clay's passport TO GOTTENBURG. 

To all who shall see these presents, greeting : 

The President of the United States of America having appointed the Honorable Henry Clay, late Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, a Minister Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary, 
iii conjunction with John Quincy Adams, James A. Bayard, and 
Jonathan Russell, Esquires, to negotiate and sign a treaty of 
peace with Great Britain ; and the said Henry Clay, who is the 
bearer hereof, being now on his way to Gottenburg, in the kingdom of Sweden, for the purpose of fulfilling the objects of his 
mission ; These are to request all officers of the United States 
aforesaid, civil and military, the officers and subjects of powers 
in amity with the said United States, and all others whom it 
may concern, not to offer to the said Henry Clay any hinderance 
or molestation whatsoever ; but, on the contrary, to aflord to 
him and to his secretaries and attendants, with their baggage, all 
necessary aid, comfort, and protection. 

In faith whereof, 1, James Monroe, Secretary of State for the 
United States of America, have hereunto subscribed my name 
and affixed the seal of my office. 

Given at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> City, this 4th day of February, A. D.

MRS. CLAY TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, March 10. 

My dear Husband, Mr. Barker called to-day to let me know 
that he has an opportunity of sending letters to Gottenburg, and 
offered to take charge of one for you. I heard the other day from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> that it is more sickly than it ever has been. 
Nelly Hart had twelve negroes sick ; Theodore wrote me that all our family were well. The children that I have with me are all well, and Henry is always talking of you, he comes up and kisses me for his papa. I long very much to be at home with my family, for I am very dreary here as I do not pay visits ; indeed I found I could not go out without you in the evening, but I do all in my power to keep me from being melancholy. Our 
suit in this court was tried the other day ; I have not heard that 
it is decided. Mr. Wickliff started on Sunday last for Kentucky. 
Mrs. Brown has at last made up her mind to go home with me 
and spend the summer. Judge Todd and his lady have been 
very polite to me since you left this ; the Judge called the 
other day to examine the light wagon we were to have got from 
Mr. L. but he found it so completely worn out that I determined 
not to take it ; we shall I hope get on without it. Mr. Bibb paid 
me the $500 as soon as he got here. You need not make yourself the least uneasy on our account, for I believe we shall do 
very well. Mr. Granger has been turned out of office. A great 
many blame Mr. Madison. Susan and Ann send their love to 
you. May God spare you to us. Do take care of yourself for 
our sakes 


MR. BAYARD TO MR. CLAY. 

London, April 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>. 

Dear Sib, The mail of last evening brought the intelligence of your arrival at Gottenburg. I present you my congratulations upon your safe passage across the Atlantic. Mr. 
Gallatin and myself left St. Petersburg on the 25th of January, 
and arrived at Amsterdam on the 4th of March. In that city 
we received the first advice of the direct negotiation proposod 
to be held between the United States and Great Britain, at Gottenburg, and of the intention of our government to send additional commissioners from America. Knowing that some time 
would elapse before your arrival in Europe, and also before the 
appointment of commissioners on the part of this Government, 
we thought it likely that more good might result from spending 
the interval in this country rather than in Holland. 

We came over on the 9th inst. at a moment not very propitious for the objects we had in view. The Alhes had taken 
possession of Paris, and the next day brought the news of Bonaparte's formal abdication of the thrones of France and Italy. 
The intelligence completely turned the heads of all ranks who 
seem to have thought of nothing since, but the means of manifesting their joy on the occasion. 

It is much to be apprehended that this great and unexpected 
event will have an unfavorable influence upon the state of affairs 
between the United States and Great Britain. There is reason to 
think that it has materially changed the views of the British Ministry. In fact the sudden reduction of their naval and military establishments would create much embarrassment, and the 
American war furnishes too good a pretense to avoid it. And 
the great augmentation of their disposable force presents an 
additional temptation to prosecute the war. You must also 
know that the temper of the country is highly excited against 
us, and decidedly expressed in favor of the continuance of hostilities. 

I do not pretend, however, to speak at present with any certainty of the intentions of the Government, for we have had no 
communication with any member of it. 

I think they have avoided any intercourse with us, but this 
may be attributed to the absence of Lord Castlereagh and the 
indisposition of the other ministers to interfere with the affairs 
of his department. 

We can not learn that any step has yet been taken toward the 
selection of characters to be charged with the negotiation on 
the part of this Government. It is stated, and upon such authority as to deserve credit, that no appointment will be made 
till the Government is officially notified of the appointment of 
the American commissioners and of their arrival at the place of 
rendezvous. Mr. G. and myself have thought it, therefore, of 
sufficient importance to dispatch a special messenger to apprise 
you of the fact, and to enable you by his return, without loss 
of time, to make the official communication. 

If there be a discretion on the subject, we would thoroughly 
recommend that some town in Holland should be substituted in 
lieu of Gottenburg, as the seat of the negotiation. There can 
be no doubt that the change would facilitate and accelerate the 
result. You may rely upon the friendly dispositions of the 
Prince of Orange, of which we had distinguished proofs during 
a short residence at Amsterdam. 

One of the first acts of the Government of the Prince, was to 
nominate a minister to the United States. 

I shall remain in London till I have the pleasure of hearing 
from you, unless (which is not to be expected), in the mean time 
commissioners should be appointed on the part of this Government. 

This letter will be delivered to you by Colonel Milligan, who 
accompanied me as private secretary to St. Petersburg. He is 
deserving of your confidence, and I beg leave to recommend him 
to your attentions. 



ALBERT GALLATIN TO MR. CLAY, 

London, April 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>. 

Dear Sir, We have just heard of your arrival, but have 
received no letters, and I am yet ignorant whether I am one of 
the new commission to treat of peace. My arrangements must 
depend on that circumstance, and I wait with impatience for the 
official account which you must have brought. For that reason 
Mr. Bayard addresses you and Mr. Russel in his own name ; but 
I coincide fully with him in the opinion that the negotiations 
should by all means be opened here, or at least, in Holland, if 
this is not rendered impracticable from the nature of the commission. If this has unfortunately been limited to treating of 
peace at Gottenburg, which seems highly improbable, there is 
no remedy. But if the commission admits of a change of 
place, I v/ould feel no hesitation in removing them, at least, to 
any other neutral place, whatever may be the language of the 
instructions. For their spirit would be fully answered by treating in any other friendly country as well as if at Gottenburg. 
On that point I feel great anxiety, because on account of the 
late great changes in Europe, and of the increased difficulties 
thence arising in making any treaty, I do believe that it would 
be utterly impossible to succeed in that corner, removed from 
every interference in our favor on the part of the European powers, and compelled to act with men clothed with limited authorities, and who might at all times plead a want of instructions. 

You are sufficiently aware of the total change in our affairs 
produced by the late revolution, and by the restoration of universal peace in the European v/orld, from which we are alone 
excluded. A well organized and large army is at once liberated 
from any European employment, and ready, together with a 
superabundant naval force, to act immediately against us. How 
ill-prepared we are to meet it in a proper manner no one knows 
better than yourself; but, above all, our own divisions and the hostile attitude of the Eastern States give room to apprehend that a 
continuance of the war might prove vitally fatal to the United 
States. 

I understand that the ministers, with whom we have not had 
any direct intercourse, still profess to be disposed to make an 
equitable peace. But the hope not of ultimate conquest, but of 
a dissolution of the union, the convenient pretense which the 
 

American war will afford to preserve large military establishments, and above all the force of popular feeling may all unite 
in inducing. the cabinet in throwing impediments in the way of 
peace. They will not, certainly, be disposed to make concessions, nor probably displeased at a failure of negotiations. That 
the war is popular, and that national pride, inflated by the last 
unexpected success, can not be satisfied without what they call 
the chastisement of America, can not be doubted. The mass 
of the people here know nothing of American politics but 
through the medium of federal speeches and newspapers faithfully transcribed in their own journals. They do not even suspect that we have any just cause of complaint, and consider us 
altogether as the aggressors, and as allies of Bonaparte. In these 
opinions it is understood that the ministers do not participate ; 
but it will really require an effort on their part to act contrary to 
public opinion ; and they must, even if perfectly sincere, use 
great caution and run some risk of popularity. A direct,, or at 
least, a very near intercourse with them is therefore highly important, as I have no doubt that they would go further themselves than they would be willing to intrust any other person. 
To this must be added, that Lord Castlereagh is, according to the 
best information I have been able to collect, the best disposed 
man in the cabinet, and that coming from France and having 
had intercourse with the Emperor Alexander, it is not improbable that these dispositions may have been increased by the personal expression of the Emperor's wishes in favor of peace with 
America. Whatever advantage may be derived from that circumstance and from the Emperor's arrival here, would be altogether lost at Gottenburg. 

I have confined my letter to this single point, and hoping 
soon to hear from you and from Mr. Russell to whom you will 
present my best compliments. 



MR. RUSSELL TO MR. CLAY. 

Stockholm, April 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>. 

Dear Sir, I did not reach this place until yesterday, a little 
before noon. The roads were very fine, but the weather, after 
the first day, execrable. I have announced my arrival to the minister, and he has assigned one o'clock to-morrow for our first interview, when I shall probably learn when I may expect to be 
presented to the king. This place, as far as I have yet seen it, promises to be agreeable. 

Mr. Speyer received this morning a letter from Mr. Adams, 
dated the 11th of this month, in which he says he purposes to 
leave St. Petersburg about the 20th of this month, and hopes to 
arrive somewhere in Sweden, by the 1st of May probably at 
Stockholm. This route, he says, will depend upon the thermometer of the next ten days. 

I shall endeavor to complete my preparatory errand here, in 
season, to join Mr. Adams in his progress toward Gottenburg, 
should he come this way. 

If you hear any thing of our wandering colleagues, please 
communicate it to me, as well as every thing else of an interesting nature at your residence. 

Please say to our worthy secretary, and to Captain Angus, that 
I think Stockholm will fully indemnify them for the fatigue and 
expense of a visit. 

I shall occasionally report progress, and give you a sketch of 
the times here. Make my compliments to Mr. Carroll. 



MR. RUSSELL TO MR. CLAY. 

Stockholm, May 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>. 

My dear Sir, I received, day before yesterday, your communication, by the Consul General of Portugal, but not in season 
to return an answer by the mail of that day. 

With regard to our power to enter into the negotiation elsewhere than at Gottenburg, I think the view which you have 
taken is quite satisfactory. A restriction of this power having 
been omitted in the commission, by the express direction of the 
President, appears to explain sufficiently his intentions, and to 
leave us at liberty, notwithstanding the incidental insertion of 
'' Gottenburg" in the instructions, to treat wherever we may 
have the most promising prospect of success. 

The only point, therefore, which remains for consideration, is 
that of expediency, and the reasons urged by Mr. Gallatin, Mr. 
Bayard, and yourself, have great weight. 

The apprehension of any serious evil from this quarter, occasioned by our change of position, is, I trust, without foundation. 
 

I regret, however, that I had not known the opinions of Messrs. 
Gallatin and Bayard in season to have shaped my commimications here accordingly. Something like a retrograde movement 
will now be necessary, and it may require some address to reconcile this Government to the new arrangement. I hope it may 
be in our power to throw the responsibility on the British Government, but am somewhat afraid the original proposition will 
appear to have come from our colleagues. 

My personal convenience and inclination are, indeed, opposed 
to the change, but considerations of this kind must yield to those 
of public utility. 

I am placed rather in an awkward predicament by your communication, as the uncertainty in which it leaves our ultimate 
location, disqualifies me from adapting my movements here with 
sufficient precision to either alternative. This is a situation truly 
diplomatic, but I pray you to relieve me from its embarrassments 
the first moment it is in your power to do so. 

I had, on the 29th ultimo, my presentations successively to the 
King, the Queen, the Duke of Sudermania, and the Princess 
Sophia. The early day assigned for this ceremony may be considered as some proof of a friendly disposition toward us. 

The Crown Prince was to leave Paris on the 23d ultimo, and 
will probably be here by the 20th of this month. I hope, therefore, to have an opportunity of seeing him before my departure 
from Stockholm. 

I wrote you soon after my arrival here, but my letter does not 
appear to have been received at the date of yours. I hear nothing more of Mr. Adams, but as the navigation is now open from 
Abo, he will probably soon be in Sweden. 

Please remember me kindly to Mr. Carroll, and Captain Angus 
and his officers. 


MR. RUSSELL TO MR. CLAY. 

Stockholm, July 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>. 
My dear Sir, 1 have had the pleasure to receive your letter 
of the 27th ult. My distress at the delay which our joint errand 
has encountered, had almost become intolerable, and the kind of 
comfort I have received from Mr. Adams, has afforded very little 
relief. His apprehensions are rather of a gloomy cast with 
regard to the result of our labors, in which, I hope, however, he 
will be. disappointed. He will show you a letter to Lord Castlereagh, which I have signed. I have done this in the expectation 
that the letter will not be delivered without the signatures of the 
other gentlemen composing the mission, and solely in the case 

that the conferences be not transferred to Holland, on the terms 
which you proposed, that is, if Messrs. Gallatin and Bayard, not 
being able to obtain your condition, and declining a removal 
without it, should again recur to you at Gottenburg, with new 
propositions. I think indeed that the condition itself was not of 
importance, although you had certainly reason to believe it to be 
so. Things have, however, come to my knowledge since my 
arrival here, which have entirely altered my view of the disposition and policy of this cabinet. Although the condition be 
not important, yet I find Mr. Adams, who also believes it not to 
be important, has definitively made up his mind not to remove 
without it, and is even uncertain if he will go with it. His 
reasons are that our present instructions will not admit of a negotiation on the basis which will be proposed by the adverse 
party, and therefore, the sooner we meet, the sooner shall we 
know the result, and be able to act accordingly. He is decided, 
therefore, that Gottenburg is to be preferred, unless Holland 
should already be agreed on. I have signed the above note to 
prevent the delay of applying to me, or the necessity of acting 
without me, should the circumstances occur in which it can be 
properly used. 

I sincerely wish with you that the twenty prizes of the Rattlesnake, in Norway, could be condemned, but to this procedure 
there are insuperable difficulties. I do not recollect a single 
instance of a sovereign having freely consented to the institution 
of a foreign court of admiralty within his dominions, and the 
peculiar situation of Norway at this moment, presents additional 
difficulties. Both the contending parties must consider the 
friendship of England to be indispensable to their success, and 
so far from consenting to an extraordinary measure for the condemnation of the property in question, I am not without alarm 
that either of them would be willing to conciliate that friendship, by a violation of the rights of the captor. 

The prince will be here to-morrow, and I shall follow Mr. 
Adams, v/ho will hand you this letter, as soon as I learn the 
definitive location of the mission. I regret very much to learn 
the serious indisposition of Captain Angus. Please present my 
respects to him, and assure him of my best wishes for a speedy 
and perfect recovery. 

It seems that a mail from England has at length amved at 
Gottenburg, but I have not yet learned if it brought you any 
 

thing of a decisive character. A letter from Mr. Beasley, of the 
13th May, informs me that Admiral Lord Gambler, Mr. Adams, 
and Mr. Goulbourn, are the persons who are to meet us, and 
that the place of the conference would be ascertained the next 
day. 



SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH TO MR. CLAY. 

15 Great George Street, Monday Forenoon. 
Sir James Mackintosh is so eager to have the honor of Mr. 
Clay's acquaintance that he ventures to request his company this 
evening, to a small party, when Lady Mackintosh will be most 
happy to receive him, at nine or ten o'clock, with any gentleman of his suite who may be so good as to honor them with 
coming. 



MR. ADAMS TO MESSRS. BAYARD, CLAY, RUSSELL AND GALLATIN. 

Ghent, January 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1815">1815</a>. 

Gentlemen, A letter from Mr. Hughes of which I subjoin a 
copy, was received by me this morning. I presume you will have 
heard more directly, and before this will reach you, what were the 

interruptions or difficulties which delayed his departure so long beyond the time he had anticipated by his former letter, and occa 
sioned the disappointment of Avhich he complains. No intermediate letter from him has been received. 

I contemplate leaving this city this day week, and hope to 
find a passport from Mr. Crawford at Bruxelles. 

I am w-ith great respect, gentlemen, your very humble and 
obedient servant, John aumcY Adams. 

[CopT.l On BoaFwD the Transit, 

6th Jantiary, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1815">1815</a> Friday, 2 f.m. 

Gentlemen, ^I am at last under way ; we are now about 
four leagues from Bordeaux ; I came on board last night, and am 
in hopes that there will be no further interruption or difficulty to 
delay my progress to the United States. I am afraid I shall be 
the second or third herald, in point of time ; yet the news is so 
happy for the country, that in the pleasure of contemplating its 
fine eff"ect at home I lose almost all the mortification of the disappointment I have suffered. 

I have the honor to be be very respectfully your obedient 
servant, C. Hughes, Jr. 

Ameiican Ministers at Ghent.

JAMES MONROE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, October 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1815">1815</a>. 

My dear Sir, Since the overthrow of France, Russia has 
acquired the highest degree of political importance in relation to 
these States. As a great power, friendly to a liberal system of 
neutral rights, and with whose dominions our commerce had become considerable, she held, before that event, a distinguished 
rank ; but by it her weight in the general scale has been much 
augmented. Russia forms, in effect, at this time, the principal 
check on the overgrown power of England, on which account, 
and many others, it is immensely the interest of these States to 
cultivate a good understanding with her sovereign. The President is desirous of confiding to you a mission to that power, 
and will be much gratified to hear that it will be acceptable to 
you. I write you now that you may be enabled to consider the 
proposition before you leave home, and make the necessary arrangements for your departure, in case you accept the trust ; 
though you will not infer from this intimation that all due and 
friendly attention will not be paid to your convenience as to the 
time. 

It would have been very agreeable to the President as well as 
to me, to have had an opportunity of seeing and conferring with 
you on your arrival, but our absence from this city and your 
anxiety to join your family after so long a separation from them, 
were obstacles not to be surmounted. 

In the hope of seeing you soon, I shall reserve for that occasion comments on other subjects. 


THOMAS VAUGHAN TO MR. CLAY. 

Near Cardiff, December 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1815">1815</a>. 

Mt good AND WORTHY SiR, Haviiig Seen an account in our 
newspapers of your safe arrival in America, gives me great pleasure, and I hope this will meet you in perfect health, and every 
other earthly comfort. And I now take the liberty of informing 
you that we have received an account from my son's wife, Mrs. 
Vaughan, of his death, so long back as the 5th of April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>. 
We have also an account of it from a relation of mine, living 
near to Upper Bluelick, but on whom (I am sorry to say) we can 
set no dependence at all ; and therefore take the liberty of begging that you will be pleased to have the goodness to inquire into 
the state of his (my son's) affairs and property, and, if possible, 
to get for his daughter (now with me from an infant, and thirtytwo years of age) whatever is right, and justly her due ; as she 
is a good, honest, and industrious young woman, and deserving 
of every justice and encouragement that can be lawfully given 
her ; and your influence will, no doubt, have great weight in 
settling it justly, and we desire no other ; but, by Mrs. Vaughan's 
account, there seems to be but little for her ; and we are at such a 
distance, it is next to impossible for us to see into it ; but I know, 
from all my son's letters, it was his intention to make his daughter 
nearly equal to his son ; and by a letter of his to me, as far back 
as the 20th May, 1807, he referred me to you in case of his 
death (which was the only knowledge I had of his acquaintance 
with you, and the reason I took the liberty of writing to you in 
London), in the following words : " I will request Henry Clay 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, Esquire, to give you every information respecting 
my property, etc., etc. He is one of our Senators, in Congress, 
which is now sitting ; he is very friendly to me, and, I am 
sure, will do me any reasonable request," etc., etc. 

If you will have the goodness to take the trouble on you to 
get for her what is right and just, and, after deducting for your 
trouble and every expense, will be pleased to remit the remainder, 
directed as under, whenever it may be convenient, will greatly 
oblige me and my grand-daughter (who begs her respectful 
compliments to you), and am, with deference and respect (although unknown), your obedient servant. 

P. S. I am sorry we had not the honor of seeing you in Wales, 
 

as "we made provision for your reception, after we heard, by my 
nephew, of your longer stay in London, and particularly as we 
have the largest iron and tin works in this neighborhood, that 
are in Great Britain, and through all of which I could have conducted you, and would have been well worth your seeing. I have 
written by this packet to my daughter-in-law at Bluelick, telling 
her I have written to you on the above subject, and also to invite my grandson over to England, as I should be very glad to 
see him here, for one whole year at least, if I live so long. 

Whenever convenient, I shall be very glad of a few lines from 
you, to hear how matters go, and to give me your proper address, 
as I am at a loss whether to address you as minister, or commissioner, or as a private gentleman. Your goodness will excuse 
any defects you may meet with in this scrawl, from my age of 
eighty-five years, and want of memory, etc., although I am as 
healthy and as heart-well as ever, blessed be God for that, and all 
his other goodness to me. We are in general very happy to be 
at peace with America in particular, and with the rest of the 
world ; but our farmers and manufacturers complain heavily, the 
former because grain, cattle, horses, etc., sell very low, and the 
latter for want of orders for their wares, etc. Almost every thing 
is lowered very much since you left England, and the surrender 
of Napoleon ; but we are in hopes of our taxes being lowered to 
ease the farmers and trades, and traffic revived with you, and 
with other countries, to relieve our manufacturers. 

I pray God bless you with good health, long life, and every 
other comfort that this uncertain world can give you, are the 
sincere prayers of your unknown friend and humble servant. 



HENRY GOULBURN TO MR. CLAY. 

Downing Street, March 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1816">1816</a>. 

My DEAR Sir, I am really very much obliged to you for 
your letter of the 7th of January, which I received a short time 
since, both because it has enabled me to relieve the anxiety 
which a friend of mine in this country (Mr. Harris) felt for the 
fate of the relation to whom it particularly relates, and not less 
because it has assured me that, though situated in so distant a 
quarter of the world, I nevertheless bear a place in your recollection. 

I had already learned the death of Mr. Bayard before your 
letter reached me, and although I could not but regret the event, 
I was glad that he had at least the satisfaction of seeing his 
family before his death. 

I have to congratulate you on your resumption of the arduous 
and honorable situation which you left in order to meet us at 
Ghent. I trust that this is an evidence that our joint work is 
approved in America. I assure you it is so in England ; and 
whatever may be said in the newspapers on either side of the 
Atlantic, I have little doubt that it will continue to be approved 
by all rational persons. You seem by your papers to be fighting 
the same battle in America that we are fighting here, namely, 
that of putting peace establishments on a footing not unbecoming 
the growth of the population and the empire in which they are 
to be maintained. It is impossible that either country should 
feel any jealousy of the other so long as the augmentation does 
not exceed the necessity of the case, and I have not heard an 
argument any where to prove that it does so exceed in either 
case. From all that I know, I am sure I can take upon me to 
relieve the apprehensions which you seem to entertain of hostile 
movements on the part of this country in any quarter of the 
globe. Newspapers will, on subjects of this kind, propagate any 
intelligence, however false, which is likely to excite an interest 
on the part of their readers, but I am sure you will agree with 
me in thinking it the duty of every man to avoid giving the 
authority of his belief to any of the rumors which they so convert for their own purposes into facts. 

When you see Mr. Gallatin, may I beg you to present to him 
my best respects, and if at any time I can be of any service to 
you or to him in this country, I trust you will have no hesitation 
in commanding me, for I can assure you that nothing could give 
me greater pleasure. 



JAMES MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

MoNTPELiER, August 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1816">1816</a>. 

Dear Sir, Mr. Dallas seems to have made up his mind to 
retire early in October from the department in his hands, and the 
event may draw after it a vacancy in the War Department. 
Will you permit me to avail our country of your services in the 
 

latter ? It will be convenient to know your determination as 
soon as you have formed it, and it will be particularly gratifying 
if it assent to my request. 



JAMES MONROE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, March 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1817">1817</a>. 
Sir, I had the honor to receive your letter of yesterday last 
night, advising me that the chamber of the House of Representatives would be put, by the officers of the House, in a condition 
to receive me to-day, for the purpose of taking the oath prescribed by the Constitution for the President of the United States. 
I have hastened to transmit the communication to the Chairman 
of the Committee of the Senate, and I beg you to accept my 
acknowledgment for your polite attention. 



LORD GAMBIER TO MR. CLAY. 

IvER Gkove, January 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>. 

My dear Sir, I had much satisfaction in receiving your letter of the 6th November, by the hand of Mr. Burgess, from whom 
and from Mr. Mills, I had the pleasure of hearing of your health 

and welfare. I return you many thanks for the kind and obliging terms in which you are so good as to express yourself toward me, and can with great truth assure you it would afford 
me much gratification if the course of events should approximate us so that I could have the pleasure of your society, and 
avail myself of any opportunity that might offer by which I 
could evince m'y regard and esteem personally for you. I hope 
Messrs. Burgess and Mills received every necessary assistance 
and kindness from the several persons, Mr. Wilberforce and 
others, to whom they were introduced, toward the object of 
their benevolent undertaking. I regret their short visit to this 
country deprived me of the pleasure of performing any kind 
offices of hospitality and respect that their own characters give 
them claim to, and which would have been gratifying to me to 
show to any person in whose interest you take a part. 

If Mr. Adams should be near you when this comes to your 
hand, I will beg of you to communicate my best regards to 
him. 

With every cordial wish for your health and prosperity, I remain, my dear sir, in great respect, your faithful and most humble servant. 


PETER B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

Albany, January 29, 1822. 

Dear Sir, I arrived two days ago at this place, where not 
only the members of our Legislature, but most of the active political talent and mischief of the State are now congregated. I 
have not, during this period, been inattentive to the great question that at present engages the speculations of the politicians 
throughout the Union, and I think I do not deceive you when I say 
that your prospects here are highly flattering. You are probably 
aware that some six or eight months ago there was a partial understanding and commitment among some of our most active 

politicians in favor of Mr. C d, and it is to this class that my 

conversations and views have been principally directed. Many 
of them are now ready to change their ground, and even the 
most zealous are willing to lie still at present, and eventually to 
be governed by future and clearer indications of public sentiment 
on this subject 

You will see Mr. Van Buren in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and I beg you to 
pay him some attention. I am decidedly of opinion that he will 
yet be for you. His best and strongest friends here are so, and 
I know that his own views have been essentially changed since 
last spring. He will not, I presume, avow his preference of any 
candidate during" the present session of Congress, and perhaps it 
is desirable that he should not. Be civil also to Rochester of 
our State, who is a very clever young man, and strongly your 
friend. A rumor is in circulation here that you and D. Clinton 
are playing in concert, and that you and he will run on the same 
ticket. I need not tell you that such a rumor, once believed, 
would prostrate all your hopes he\e. The recent, and all but 
unanimous, rejection of the Clintoman judges by our Senate, 
shows the temper of the State in regu-rJ to that class of politicians. Can you with propriety say something in a letter to me 
on the subject of this supposed coaliticn which I may show confidentially to two or three persons ? It might be attended with 
good consequences. Noah, the Advocate man, is now here. I 
have had several conversations with hiri. and although his pre
delections are still for Mr. C d, his zeal and confidence have 

greatly abated. He finds that the State is not disposed to go 
with him, and expresses a willingness to be quiet, until the sentiments of the old republican party shall be more fully developed. 



JOSE M. DEL. REAL TO MR. CLAY. 

Bordeaux, February 23, 1822. 

Sir, Both by honor of my country and duty of friendship, I 
think myself obliged to make over to posterity the image of 
Don Josef M. Garcia de Toledo, my particular friend, and the 
first defender of the rights of his country, and as I was favored 
with the honor of your acquaintance in London, and convinced 
as I am of a great deal of interest you lay hold of for the liberty 
and independence as well as for all that belongs to the glorious 
revolution of South America, I take the liberty of sending you 
six stamps of his portrait, which I entreat you to have the 
goodness of accepting as an acknowledgment of my duty to 
you. 

After a few days I shall embark to Carthagena, v/here, if it is 
in my way to render you any service, I should be very glad to 
be honored with your commands. 


B. M. JOHNSON TO MR. CLAY. 

Washikgton, April 1, 1822. 
Deae Sir, I have seen the President, who has again assured me 
that he would get Mr. Wirt to re-examine your claim, and he will 
bring the thing to a close. I see that Fickler has republished a 
piece from the " Franklin Gazette," in favor of Mr Calhoun, and 
some letters from our friends who dislike his course. I do not 
know his motive in doing this. I have not written a word to 
him on the subject of the next President. I saw a letter of his 
to Mr. Johnson, in which he says he is for you. It is very possible that some of your particular friends may think that as I am 
intimate with him, I may have some influence in this respect, 
and knowing the disposition with some, to place every thing to 
my account, I hope you will not only believe me incapable of 
promoting any thing unfavorable to you, but whenever a different sentiment is communicated or hinted to you, my feelings 
may be explained. I intend, in this business, to keep a straightforward course, and while I consider it my duty to be on terms 
of personal friendship with others, if I find it reciprocal, no 
person shall doubt my course where I can be of any service 
to you. 



rrURBIDE TO MR. CLAY. 

Mexico, May 6, 1822. 
My dear Sir, Through the means of the captain of the 
navy, Don Eugenio Cortes, I have been informed of the great 
services by which you have furthered the success of his commission, and contributed to the prosperous advantages that 
resulted from it ; this generous course, the fruit of this enlightened age, excites my gratitude, and obliges me to give you my 
most sincere thanks, and offer you my friendship ; for this philanthropic conduct that emanates from a liberal education, and 
whose end is the civilization of nations, though it relates to the 
whole Mexican Empire, if its success should be in proportion to 
its promise, I offer you the gratitude which is due to you by all, 
and my most particular thanks for the present of books, and for 
the value you set on my portrait. In exchange for it, I am 
waiting for yours, which is announced by our common friend 
Cortes, and without seeing it, it gives me a satisfaction, from that 
 

common effect which can not be explained, in which men reciprocally love without knowing each other, in which the mind 
forms favorable prepossessions, and gives to the person (for so it 
delights in), as many virtues as it pleases, takes for true what it 
conjectures, and goes so far as to give to the portrait expression 
and gestures. But our case is different from this your works 
are distinguished, my correspondence is a debt of justice to their 
merit, and I promise myself the continuance of duties so praiseworthy, and protest to render you the same in like circumstances. 



EUGENIO CORTES TO MR. CLAY. 

Philidelphia, June 19, 1822. 

The Honorable Henry Clay: 

I have the honor to deliver to you the inclosed letter from 
the supreme chief of the Mexican Empire, who directed me to 
present it to you personally, as a testimony of the gratitude, esteem, and distinction, which the supreme chief of the Mexican 
nation entertains for the virtues, talents and services displayed 
by you in favor of the just cause sustained by all the States of 
South America, to gain their independence. 

This occasion affords me the opportunity of offering to you 
my respects, and of assuring you that I am your most faithful 
obedient servant. 



PETER B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

Black Rock, July 8, 1822. 
Dear Sir, It has been the misfortune of this State, that for 
a number of years past, its political concerns have been managed, or rather distracted, by a few ambitious men, whose views 
have extended only to their own personal aggrandizement, and 
on almost every great national question, our strength has been 
scattered and wasted by premature and unadvised commitments, 
made by these headlong and selfish politicians. As regards the 
interesting question which is the subject of your letter, a new 
and more circumspect course of proceeding has been adopted. 
A mutual understanding now exists among the principal republicans of the State, that it is yet too early to act on this question, and that, whatever may be the private sentiments and predilections of individuals, it would be imprudent at present to promulgate them. Whenever the proper time shall arrive (and 
perhaps the next winter session of our Legislature may be selected as such), a full and friendly consultation and interchange 
of sentiments will take place, and we are not without hopes of 
producing, by this course, a unanimity that will insure to this 
State (what it has never possessed), an influence proportioned to 
its reputation and wealth. Whoever may be the candidate fairly 
designated by the majority, I shall consider myself bound, as a 
republican, to give him my support. I have indeed been one 
of the advisers of this cautious and circumspect policy, because 
I have deemed it the wisest that this State, under present circumstances, could pursue. If we had a favorite candidate in 
one of our own citizens, it would aff'ord a fair apology for our 
taking the field early, but we have none, and you are aware of 
the jealousy that exists, particularly at the South, against the 
growing power of the great State of New York, and if we 
were to manifest our solicitude, by making an early selection, 
that very circumstance might weaken the chance of our candidate, and perhaps throw him into a minority. 

The Republicans of this State have been so often and shamefully deceived and abused by the professed friendship, as well 
as open hostility of the opposite party, that the first requisite in 
then" candidate will be, that he be a Republican of the old school, 
and I know of no one who, in addition to so many other splendid 
qualifications, can better sustain the integrity of this character, 
than my friend from Kentucky. 

I expect to see a number of my political friends at my house 
during the summer, and among them, Mr. Van Buren, of the 
Senate. The subject of the next Presidency will of course be 
canvassed, and I will, in a future letter, give you my impressions 
in regard to the prevailing views of the Republicans of this 
State. 

Mrs. P. is in excellent health, and desires her best respects to 
you. 



LANGDON CHEVES TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, July 27, 1822. 

My dear Sir, Your favor of the 5th instant was duly received. I have put your brother in nomination, and his and 
your wish will be duly and respectfully considered. The appointments for the Orleans office will be made on the 27th November next, at which time I will be merely nominally an officer 
of the bank, as I have determined to leave it a few weeks after. 
I perceive you are again a candidate for Congress, in which I 
suppose you are right. The great question seems to be but little 
agitated yet. You will perceive from the " Sentinel" of this 
city, which is one of the oraeles of the democratic party in this 
part of the State the " Franklin Gazette" is the other that 
there is a schism among the active men. The " Sentinel" appears to incline to Crawford. New York appears to be completely 
undecided, and apparently asking for an offer ; but I really know 
nothing about it, and hear little. 



PATRICK HENRY TO MR. CLAY. 

August 21, 1822. 

Dear Sir, You must make Clinton President, which, with 
your force and talents, public and private, you can accomplish. ! 
He has pretensions in every respect a man of business, is bold j 
and honorable an elegant scholar deeply read liberal altogether in his ideas. He would return the favor with fidelity. 
He has no sneaking, tricky vices. You would be the next 
President, from character, pretensions, experience, and, coming 
from the West, you would be expected and attended to by the 
nation. You would be Vice-President or Secretary of State. 
The former would keep you out of turmoil and responsibility, 
and perhaps be the safest place. You would be happy in it, honored and supported by every body. 

Clinton has name, fame, talents, and useful and lasting honors 
to sustain him for any or in any station he may fill. It would 
be worthy of Clay and Kentucky to join New York and Clinton 
in so glorious a career in saving the Union. 


B. W. LEIGH TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, November 9, 1822. 

My dear Sir, I had the happiness to receive your letter of 
the 29th October this morning, and I am heartily thankful to 
you for it. It was the more welcome, as it served to assure me 
of the re-establishment of your health. The newspapers represented you, some weeks ago, as very dangerously ill ; and one 
of them killed you outright which your distant friends regard 
as a very unpardonable abuse of the freedom of the press. 

It was considerate and kind in you to send m-e your report of 
our arrangements to the Legislature of Kentucky the more so 
since I must plead guilty to the charge of having broken my 
promise to write to you on my return home. The truth is, that 
when I got home, I had to write so many letters which I was 
obliged to write, that I soon came to a conclusion to write none 
but such as were absolutely indispensable. I trust to your own 
experience in like cases to estimate the worth of this apology. 

As to yourself in particular, I §hall take this occasion to say, 
that there was no part of your conduct in regard to the peculiar 
state of yoiu: local politics (and I was very observant of it all), 
which impressed me with such high respect, and excited so warm 
a sentiment of approbation, as the constant effort I saw you making to impress it upon all parties, that there was no desperation 
either in the distemper of the State, or in the remedies that had 
been applied, and that it behooved all men to treat them both with 
patience, temper, and moderation, as well as frankness and 
steadiness. 

Tell my friends in Kentucky that I remember them as I ought. 
Have the goodness to present my best respects to Mrs. Clay. 




B. W. LEIGH TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, Feb. 12, 1823. 

Mt dear Sir, I have received your truly kind and friendly 
letter. Far from being surprised at the indignation which the 
conduct of the Virginia Legislature, in respect to the convention 
agreed on between us last summer, has excited in your breast, I 
unite in the sentiment ; but my indignation is aggravated by the 
sense of personal mortification at such a defeat of my best efforts 
for the public service, and of burning shame for the ridicule and 
dishonor which Virginia has brought on herself. If you be thus 
indignant, what must be the feelings of your colleague, Mr. 
Rowan ? I fancy I can see his resentment, disdain, and contempt. Yet, my dear sir, this deed must not be imputed to us, 
the people of Virginia, nor even to the body of her representatives it must lie at the door of a bare majority of the Senate. 
I am not sure that Kentucky is boimd to take the distinction, but 
I hope you will. I believe that the sentiment of tha people of 
Virginia toward Kentucky, is the same with my own individually, and that, I am sure, is what it ought to be. 

It is impossible to say what our assembly means to do in this 
business. Some answer must be given to Kentucky. What it 
will be, or how it can be agreed on, considering the difference 
of opinion between the two houses, I am wholly at a loss to 
conjecture. The majority in the Senate for the present, so far 
as I can learn, are perfectly careless about it. But it is impossible, I hope, that they can continue so regardless of self-respect, 
so unconcerned about the comity due to a sister State, as to leave 
matters in their present condition. Mr. Johnson desired me a 
day or two ago, to tell you that he did not think it absolutely 
hopeless, and that the Senate wiU yet consent to the ratification 
of the convention. 



M. DE BIENOU TO MR. CLAY. 

March IV, 1823. 

M. de Menou has the honor of presenting his respects to Mr. 
Clay, and while acknowledging his polite note of yesterday, 
begs leave to thank him for his attention to the affair of Apollon 
which he regrets was not tried this term. He hopes Mr. Clay 
will have the goodness to give it his continued support next year. 

Should Mr. Clay have no further use, at present, for the different papers relating to that business, and think fit to send them to 
M. de Menou, he would keep them in readiness to be returned 
to Mr. Clay on his return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 



REPUBLIC or COLOIMBIA TO SIR. CLAY. 

Favorita, December 31, 1822. 

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, begs leave to offer 
his best respects to Colonel Todd, and will have the greatest 
pleasure in presenting to the Executive of Colombia, the portrait 
of the Honorable Henry Clay, to whom the Continental States 
of the ci-devant Spanish America, are so much indebted for his 
perseverance and enlightened sagacity. 

The Secretary of State for Foreign Relations, entertains no 
doubt but that the Executive will accept a present which will 
at every moment recall to his mind, an American politician and 
a sincere friend of humanity. He does not hesitate, by anticipation, to offer to Colonel Todd his best thanks for his goodness 
and the particular confidence with which he distinguishes him. 



Bogota, April 23, 1823. 
C. S. Todd ofiers his respects to the Honorable Speaker of 
the House of Representatives of the Republic of Colombia, 
and, as a testimony of his esteem for the first Constitutional 
Congress, has the honor to present an engraved portrait of his 
distinguished friend and connection, Henry Clay, the eloquent 
advocate of the liberty of both Americas. 



La Favoeita, December 31, 1822. 

C. S. Todd's respects to Dr. Gual, Secretary of State for For 
eign Affairs, and begs leave to present, as a slight testimony of 
his esteem, an engraved portrait of his distinguished friend and 
connection, Henry Clay ; to be disposed of in such manner as 
Dr. Gual may deem most complimentary to the Executive Department of Colombia. 
 

REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA. 

House of Reprisentattves, in Bogot.^ 
April 25, 1823. 

To Me. C. S. Todd, Charge d' Affaires— 

The House of Representatives has received with the most 
hvely sense of gratitude the vahiable present you have had the 
goodness to offer. It duly appreciates the generous sentiments 
manifested in the address with which you accompanied it ; 
sentiments very worthy of the country of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> and of 
Frankhn. 

The House will not fail to pay that profound tribute of respect which is due to the Honorable Henry Clay, the intrepid 
advocate of the cause of Colombia ; and while it reserves to 
itself the occasion of manifesting in a more conspicuous manner, 
the high esteem of which he is worthy, you will condescend to 
communicate to him, the wishes which the House cherishes for 
the prosperity of the United States. God preserve you. 

DOMINGO GAYGYDO, President of the House. 



C. S. TODD TO MR. CLAY. 

Bogota, May 8, 1823. 

My dear Sir, I had the pleasure of addressing you a short 
note from Merida, in December last, and avail myself, now, of 
the return of the Swedish Consul-General to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, to 
transmit a correspondence with the authorities here, produced 
by the presentation of some of Tyler's engravings of you, three 
copies of which I had procured for the purpose ; the receipt of 
that presented to General Soublette, Intendant-General at Caracas, has not been acknowledged. The correspondence was 
originally in Spanish, and you will see in the translation that I 
have made some progress in a language, which, besides its preeminent beauties, may become emphatically that of America. 

I hope you know me sufficiently to be aware that I have not 
received with indifference, the account of the indications in 
Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri, and in the prints of other States, 
favorable to your pretensions to the next Presidency. Deatli 
and some Siberian Missions may lessen the number of your 
competitors, and whatever may be the feeling of the United States singly on the subject, there can be no doubt but that the 
united voice of continental America would elevate you to a 
station full of unexampled responsibility and of unrequited 
solicitude. I am persuaded, however, that you are yourself too 
national in your feelings, to give all the point which the people 
and Governments in the New States of Spanish America would 
wish to convey by their unqualified approbation of your conduct in relation to their supposed interests ; since it has been 
made the occasion and the pretext for indulging in cold and unworthy feelings toward our Government, and extending, in a 
much greater degree than we could wish, even to our people 
and institutions. 

I might refer you to Colonel Duane for detailed information 
with respect to the state of affairs here ; and his opinions would 
be entitled to great consideration, having devoted many years to 
the acquisition of an extensive knowledge of the country, and 
in support of the cause which the people supposed they were 
maintaining. Being myself in the diplomatic service and, moreover, under the immediate eye of a statesman, who is characteristically known never to express more than he means to say, I 
may be excused from giving an opinion on the condition of 
things ; but Colonel Duane, if he were to meet with you, would 
undeceive you with respect to many matters about which, he 
says, he has been heretofore under misapprehensions. He would 
tell you that though the county is separated from Spanish dominion and misrule, yet that Spanish duplicity in the Governors, 
and Spanish superstition in the people are but too painfully prevalent ; while the hopes of the public councils are directed to 
Europe, and especially Great Britain, in the vain delusion, that 
it is by those powers alone, their interests can be. promoted. 

I need not say, dear sir, that any communication you may 
find it convenient to make me, will be peculiarly acceptable. 


PETER B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

Black Rock, K'ovember 17, 1823. 

Dear Sir, I received your favor of September some days ago. 

The singular results in our late elections, with the speculations 
on them in our newspapers, will show you the uncertainty of the 
ultimate vote of this State on the presidential question. The 
zeal and pertinacity with which Van Buren and his friends have 
pushed Mr. Crawford (who has no substantial popularity here) 
without any other argument in his favor than the necessity of 
party d scipline, have disgusted the Republicans of this State, 
and produced great dissatisfaction and division in our ranks. 

The cleverest fellow in our delegation is Dudley Marvin, a 
new member from Ontario, to whom I have given a letter of 
introduction to you. He was from New England, and educated 
a Federalist, but is a Republican in principle and practice, and 
has for some time been in the confidence of our party. He possesses a heart as well as a head of the first order. I hope you 
will notice him in public as well as in private, and I am confident 
your attentions will be amply repaid in the pleasure you Avill 
derive from his acquaintance. 



p. p. BAKBOUR TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, December 4, 1823. 

Dear Sir, ^In answer to your note of this evening, I beg 
leave to say, that I should regret exceedingly, as far as I am 
personally concerned, to give you the slightest difficulty in the 
arrangement of committees. My own individual wish would be 
decidedly to be on no committee ; but as that might possibly 
give rise to some misconstruction, I now so far modify my wish 
as to desire to be put upon none whose labor is very great ; and 
further, not to be chairman of whatsoever committee I may be 
placed on above all, the Committee of Ways and Means I should 
most object to. Wheresoever your general arrangement may make 
it convenient to place me, I assure you in sincerity I shall be perfectly satisfied. 


W. B. ROCHESTER TO MR. CLAY. 

Bath, Steuben County, N. Y., December 20, 1823. 

My dear Sir, Your election as Speaker, considering the 
majority, and that you were opposed by a professed friend of ]\Ir. 
Crawford, has had the effect of making the few friends of the 
last-named gentleman, whom I have since conversed with, admit 
that he is not so strong a man throughout the Union as they had 
previously supposed. You were right in taking it ; had you 
declined, you would have been charged with chaffering ; indeed, 
Rufus King's paper, in New York cit)^, has already, in substance, 
charged you with having graduated some of the first of your 
official acts {ex. qr. appointments of committees), with a view to 

serve private views. That editor, Mr. , is a sad fellow, 

for it is only about a twelvemonth snice he avowed to me his 
preference of you, and ever since he has been totis viribus, for 
Adams ! 

The hollow apology which he made to me, was yom' publication disavowing any co-operation with Mr. Russell in his affair 
with Mr. Adams. 

In answer to the inquiry in your favor of the 6th instant, 
whether I correspond with Mr. Van Buren, I reply affirmatively, 
though I have not as yet heard directly from him since his arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 

I have just finished a hasty letter to him, which lies before 
me, and shall be forwarded by the same mail which takes this. 

I repeat to you that Mr. V. B.'s preference wih be of vast importance to his favorites in this State, let the choice be made as 
it may. 

I am told your health has been poor, and as your duties are doubtless arduous, let me once more beg of you to believe that I 
do not \\T:ite with a view of extracting answers. I need hardly 
say that my letters to you are written for the indulgent eye of 
friendship only. I have not time to transcribe and to correct, but 
shall occasionally drop you a hasty scroll as the tide moves on. 


JAMES MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

Montpelier, April 24, 1824. 

Dear Sir, ^I have received a copy of your speech on " American Industry" for which I pray you to accept my thanks. I find 
in it a full measure of the ability and eloquence so often witnessed on preceding occasions. But while doing this justice to 
the task you have performed, which I do with pleasure as well 
as sincerity, candor obliges me to add that I can not concur in 
tlie extent to which the pending bill carries the tariff, nor in 
some of the reasoning by which it is advocated. 

The bill, I think, loses sight too much of the general principle M^hich leaves to the judgment of individuals the choice of 
profitable employments for their labor and capital ; and the arguments in favor of it drawn from the aptitudes of our situation 
for manufacturing establishments, tend to show that these would 
take place without a Legislative interference. The law would 
not say to the cotton-planter, you overstock the market, and 
ought to plant tobacco ; and to the planter of tobacco you would 
do better by substituting wheat. It presumes that profit being 
the object of each, as the profit of each is the wealth of the 
whole, each will make whatever change the state of the markets 
and prices may require. We see, in fact, changes of this sort 
frequently produced in agricultural pursuits by individual sagacity 
watching over individual interest. And why not trust to the 
same guidance in favor of manufacturing industry, whenever it 
promises more profit than any of the agricultural branches ; or 
more than mercantile pursuits, from which we see capital readily 
transferred to manufacturing establishments likely to yield a 
greater income ? 

With views of the subject such as this, I am a friend to the 
general principle of " free industry" as the basis of a sound system of political economy. On the other hand, I am not less a 
friend to the legal patronage of domestic manufactures, as far as 
they come within particular reasons for exceptions to the general 
rule, not derogating from its generality. If the friends of the 
tariff, some of them at least, maintain opinions subversive of the 
rule, there are among its opponents views taken of the subject 
which would exclude the fair exceptions to it. 

For examples of these exceptions I take, first, the case of 
articles necessary for national defense. Second, articles of a use 
too indispensable to be subjected to foreign contingences. Third, 
cases where there may be sufficient certainty that a temporary 
encouragement will introduce a particular manufacture, which, 
once introduced, would flourish without that encouragement. 
That there are such cases is proved by the cotton manufacture, 
introduced by the impulse of the war and the patronage of the 
law, without which it might not for a considerable time have effectually sprung up. It must not be forgotten, however, that the 
great success in this case was owing to the advantage enjoyed in 
the raw material, and to the extraordinary abridgment of manual 
labor by mechanical agency. Fourth, a very important exception 
results from the frequency of wars among the manufacturing nations, the effect of a state of war on the prices of their manufactures, and the improbability that domestic substitutes will be 
provided by establishments which could not outlast occasions of 
such uncertain duration. I have not noticed any particular reference to this consideration in the discussions which have been 
published, the greater cheapness of imported fabrics being assumed from their cost in times of peace. Yet it is clear that if 
a yard of imported cloth, which costs but six dollars in peace, 
costs eight dollars in war, and the two periods should be, as for 
the last two centuries taken together they have been, nearly 
equal, a tax of nearly one dollar a yard in time of peace could 
be afforded by the consumer, in order to escape the tax imposed by the event of war. 

Without looking for other exceptions to the general principle 
restraining legislative interferences with the industrious pursuits 
of individuals, those specified give sufficient scope for a moderate 
tariff that would at once answer the purpose of revenue and 
foster domestic manufactures. 

With respect to the operation of the projected tariff, I am led 
to believe that it will disappoint the calculations both of its 
friends and of its adversaries. The latter will probably find that 
the increase of duty on articles which will be but partially manufactured at home, with the annual increment of consumers, will 
balarice at least the loss to the Treasury from the diminution of 
the tariffed imports ; while the sanguine hopes of the former 
will be not less frustrated by the increase of smuggling, particularly through our east and north frontiers, and by the attraction of the laboring class to the vacant territory. This is the 
great obstacle to the spontaneous establishment of manufactures, 
and will be overcome with most difficulty wherever land is 
cheapest, and the ownership of it most attainable. 

The tariff, I apprehend, will disappoint also those who expect 
it to put an end to unfavorable balances of trade. Our imports, 
as is justly observed, will not be short of our exports. They 
vv^ill probably exceed them. We are accustomed to buy not only 
as much as we can pay for, but as much more as can be obtained 
on credit. Until we change our habits, therefore, or manufacture the articles of luxury as well as the useful articles, we shall 

be apt to be in arrears, to a certain extent, in our foreign dealings, and have the exchange bearing against us. As long as our 
exports consist chiefly of food and raw materials, we shall 
have the advantage, in a contest of privations, over a nation supplying us with saperfluities. But in the ordinary freedom of intercourse, the advantage will be on the other side ; the wants on 
that being limited by the nature of them, and on ours as boundless as fancy and fashion. 

Excuse a letter which I fear is much too long, and be assured 
of my great esteem and sincere regard. 

P. S. Mrs. Madison desires me to offer the proper return for 
the kind wishes expressed in your note introducing Mr. Ten 
Eyck, who with his companion made the time very agreeable 
which they passed with us. 



SIR JAMES mackintosh TO MR. CLAY. 

London, June 3, 1824. 

My DEAR Sir, This note will be presented to you by Mr. 
Stanley, a grandson of the Earl of Derby, a young gentleman 
who has already shown in Parliament talents equally brilliant 
and solid, and whom I can hardly be mistaken in considering 
as destined to perform a great part in the public affairs of this 
country. He is accompanied by three other gentlemen, one of 
whom (Mr. Wortley) I know and highly vahie, and the other 
two I know to be most respectable. I know that you will consider this first visit of such a body of English travelers to the 
United States as an event which ought to interest and gratify 
the friends of both countries. I hope that I may venture to ask 
your good offices in guiding the inquiry and aiding the observation of Mr. Stanley, and in procuring access for him and his 
friends to those individuals and societies v/hich may afford them 
sufficient specimens of the great English commonwealth in which 
you perform so distinguished a part. 

The enlightened curiosity of Mr. Stanley will direct his comprehensive understanding to your laws, and government, and 
manners ; to the state of industry, wealth, and knov/ledge, and 
to the effect of all those on the virtue and ha.ppiness of the people 

There is no one more able than yourself to aid him in so difficul 
a study. I intended to have taken the same liberty with Mr. 
Adams and Mr. Crawford. But I am so very much hniTied 
(besides being indisposed) at this moment, that I am reduced to 
the necessity of requesting that you would introduce Mr. Stanley 
to them as holding the first place among those who are the hope 
of this country. After this sincere testimony to his extraordinary 
merit, it is, perhaps, presumptuous in me to add that I should 
consider their attention to him as a most pleasing mark that they 
have not forgotten the degree in which I have had the pleasure 
of enjoying their society. 


LORD GAiyiBIER TO MR. CLAY. 

IvER Grove, June 29, 1824. 

My dear Sir, I had great pleasure in receiving your very 
friendly letter by the hand of the worthy Bishop Chase, and in 
hearing of your well being from him. I have found him, as 

you truly describe him, a learned, pious, and highly estimable 
clergyman ; he passed a few days with me here, on his first 
arrival in this country, and I have had much agreeable communication with him since that time ; he gains the esteem and 
affection of all persons with whom he has become acquainted, 
he is highly respected, and has been received with great kindness wherever he has gone, and I am happy to say he has been 
very successful in the important object of his visit in this country. I very much regret that he is under the necessity of returning so soon to his diocese ; but he leaves an excellent Christian savour among the good and pious of our land. I hope we 
shall add more to the collection that has been made for the good 
and laudable work in which he is so piously and zealously engaged. 

It is a cause of great satisfaction to me that so much success 
has attended the good Bishop's visit to this country, for I greatly 
rejoice on every occasion that in any way promotes mutual 
friendship and good will between the people of our two countries. 

I feel very sensibly the kind and friendly expressions in your 
letter, toward me, and happy in every opportunity of assuring you 
of my high esteem and sincere regard. 



BISHOP CHASE TO MR. CLAY. 

WoRTnraGTON, October 14, 1824. 

My dear Sir, I have delayed, I fear, far beyond the proper 
period, forwarding to you the inclosed letter from Lord Gambier. 
My apology is the very sincere wish I have all along entertained 
of a personal interview, on the subject of which I presumed 
the letter treated, namely, his lordship's great regard for you, 
and the essential service, of which your letter to him, proved 
to me. 

I wished also to see you (perhaps at the United States Court), 
that I might assign the reasons and obtain your pardon, for using 
your name as the umpire, in a certain deed of donation of my 
estate to the contemplated Theological Seminary, for the education of young men for the Christian ministry. As it is, I can 
only send you a copy of that instrument ; and to it beg your 
favorable attention. 
 

The meeting of our Convention takes place, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chillicothe" rel="city">Chillicothe</a>, on 
the 3d of November next. Nothing of the kind could give me 
more pleasure, than to see you there, if business or the great 
importance to posterity of our plans should so incline you. 

Your very sincere friend, Charles Hammond, who has been 
of such essential service in the great work of founding this 
Seminary will be there, and, as I trust, assist us with his most 
valuable advice. Pray communicate with him on the subject 
any thing which you think will do us good. 

I take the liberty of sending you a letter addressed to Lord 
Kenyon, on the subject of my errand to England. Presuming 
you have seen what has preceded this, no apology is deemed 
necessary. 



J. J. CRITTENDEN TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a>, Feb. 15, 1825. 

Dear Sir, We are all waiting with breathless impatience, to 
know the result of the Presidential election. It was rumored 
here a few days past, that a coalition had been formed between 
Jackson and Crawford; that New York, Virginia, etc., follow 
into its ranks ; that it was bearing on irresistibly and triumphantly ; and that you and Adams were its destined victims. The 
mail of last night, however, brought no confirmation of this 
terrible rising, and we are all settling down again into the 
opinion which has for some* time prevailed here, that Adams is to 
be the President. 

I have seen the abuse that has been heaped upon you in some 
of the newspapers, and your card in the "Intelligencer." I confess that I feel some apprehension for you. There are about 
you a thousand desperadoes, political and military, following at 
the heels of leaders, and living upon expectations, that would 
think it a most honorable service to fasten a quarrel upon Mr. 
Clay, and shoot him. And this card of yours, evincing such a 
spontaneous and uncalculating spirit of gallantry, will be a signal, 
I fear, for some of these fellows to gather about you, and to 
endeavor to provoke you to some extremity. For God's sake 
be upon your guard, at least, as it respects these subalterns. As 
for the abuse there has been heaped upon you, you may safely 
regard it as the idle wind that passes by. I expected to hear 
you vilified. You occupy too lofty and imposing a stand, to 
escape. You prefer Mr. Adams under existing circumstances, 
and for that you are calumniated. And so it would equally 
have been, had you announced your preference for either of the 
other competitors. 

If, notwithstanding your support of Adams, Jackson should be 
elected, that circumstance would certainly embolden your comparatively few adversaries in this State, and enable them for a 
little while to excite some petty clamor against you. But no 
such thing can displace you from the hold you have on the pride 
and affections of Kentucky. If Adams is elected, and you will 
accept a station in his cabinet, all will be quieted in a moment. 
This is my view. 

I think I can see the policy which dictates the charges which 
are now made against you of " going over to Mr. Adams," of 

having " made your bargain" with him, and of a thousand other 
horrible conspiracies, etc. It is intended to intimidate yon, if 
possible, from the acceptance of the Department of State which 
they think Mr. Adams must tender to you, and where they 
tremble to see you. They wish to obstruct your passage to it 
by heaping up the way with all the falsehood and calumny they 
can create and invent. This is the real secret of the whole 
business, as I think. Whether I am right or wrong, I trust you 
will hold on your conrse unshaken and unaltered by all the calumny, falsehood, and scandal of your enemies. It will not be 
long before it will all recoil on themselves. I think it is due to 
yourself, to your friends here, and tonhe expectation and wishes 
of the State, that you should accept the office of Secretary of 
State, if it should be offered to you. Some few of your friends 
think your present station the more elevated and commanding 
one, and of course that you should retain it. Whatever may be 
its nominal elevation, its practical importance and power is not 
to be compared with that of the Department of State. The Chair 
of the House of Representatives is undoubtedly a very high and 
lofty station, but all its honors atid advantages are of the abstract, 
fruitless kind, and I am now convinced that no man will live to 
see the incumbent of that Chair transferred at once to the Presidency. You best know, however, what com-se to pursue. That 
it may be a prosperous and happy one, is my earnest wish. 



W. CREIGHTON TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chillicothe" rel="city">Chillicothe</a>, February 19, 1825. 

My dear Sir, I was gratified to learn by the mail of this 
morning that the long agony is over, and particularly that the 
contest was terminated on the first ballot. A protracted ballot 
could not have failed to produce great excitement, both within 
and without. Here there is entire acquiescence. The inflammable materials artificially excited in Pennsylvania and New 
York, will soon spend themselves. Thinking it probable, in the 
event of Mr. Adams' election, you might be invited to the administration, the question propounded in your letter of the 7th instant, 
is one on which I have thought a great deal this winter, and 
have endeavored, with the feeble lights I possess, to view it in 
all its ulterior bearings. Necessarily ignorant of many circum 

Stances that may exist at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> that may have a bearing, 
pro or con, my opinion is, if the offer is made, you ought to 
accept. This opinion is formed, regardless of the scurrihty and 
abuse that the election has given rise to. If a man could suffer 
himself to be driven from his purpose by means like these, he 
would always be at the mercy of the profligate and unprincipled. 
In the expression of this opinion, it is taken for granted that MR.
Adams will pursue a liberal policy, and embrace within its scope 
the great leading policy that you have been advocating. By 
uniting with such an Administration, you could not be charged, 
by the most fastidious, with a dereliction of principle for place. 

I could not, within the compass of a letter, detail my reasons 
for tlie opinion expressed, and therefore shall not attempt it. 
Should the invitation be given, your friends in Ohio will acquiesce in whatever decision you make. 

Will our friend Cheves be invited to the Treasury ? 


JOHN TYLER TO MR. CLAY 

Charles City, Marcli 27, 1825. 

Dear Sir, In the midst of the numerous accusations which 
have of late been urged against you from different quarters, 
and from none with more acrimony than from the seat of 
Government of this State, I have deemed it proper, and in some 
measure called for, to make known to you that one of the million at least, still regarded you as I am satisfied you deserve to be regarded. Instead of seeing in your course on the late presidential question aught morally or politically wrong, I am on the 
contrary fully impressed with the belief that the United States 
owes you a deep debt of gratitude for that course, resulting as 
it did in the speedy settlement of that distracting subject. Believing Mr. Crawford's chance of success to have been utterly 
desperate, you have not only met my wishes (which would be 
to you of little concern), but I do believe, the wishes and feelings of a large majority of the people of this your native State. 
I do not believe that the sober and reflecting people of Virginia 
would have been so far dazzled by military renown as to have 
conferred their suilrages upon a mere soldier one acknowledged on all hands to be of little value as a civilian. I will 
not withhold from you also the expression of my approval of 
your acceptance of your present honorable and exalted station. 
To have refused it would have been to have furnished your enemies with fresh ground of objection. Against an insiduous and 
malicious attack you courted an investigation not only before the 
Representatives of the people, but by accepting the office, before the Senate, and gave just evidence of your purity by your 
readiness to encounter your accusers, supported as they were by 
the virulence and intemperance of party feeling on the part of 
some of your very judges. For a time the tide may run against 
you, but when the ferment, excited by the feelings of the day, 
shall have subsided, and men shall regard things with unprejudiced eyes, your motives and your acts will be justly appreciated 
and the plaudits of your country will await you. This is not 
the language of flattery to one lifted high in authority. As an 
American citizen I claim to be your equal. It is the voluntary 
offering of truth at the shrine of patriotism, and is called for by the 
circumstance of our having been, in limes past, fellow laborers in 
the same vineyard of our common country, although I v/as at the 
time an unprofitable servant. When one, however, is assailed 
by unjust reproaches, the expression of confidence from a quarter even the most humble fend the most retired can not but be 
acceptable. It is under the influence of this feeling and of this 
belief that I have thus ventured to address you. 

I pray you to accept assurances of my sincere regard and unshaken confidence. 
 



CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, April 4, 1825. 

Dear Sir, I have received your address to your former 
constituents ; and, as it was franked by you, I presume I am indebted to you for it. I have read it with great pleasure as well as attention, and am gratified at the full and complete view you 
have given of some matters which the busy world has been employing itself upon. I required no evidence respecting the charge made by Mr. Kremer, nor should I have required any had I been 
unacquainted with you or with the transaction, because I have long 
since ceased to credit charges destitute of proof, and to consider 
them as mere aspersions. The minuteness of detail, however, 
will enable your friends to encounter any insinuations on that 
subject which may be thrown out in their hearing. More of 
this may be looked for than any hostility to you would produce. 
There is unquestionably a party determined to oppose Mr. 
Adams at the next election, and this party will attack him 
through you. It is an old, and has been a successful stratagem. 
No part of your letter was more necessary than that which 
respects your former relations with that gentleman. 


JUDGE STORY TO MR. CLAY. 

Salem, April 8, 1825. 

Dear Sir, I am much obliged to you for the copy of your 
address to your late constituents, which you have been pleased 
to send me. I read it with great interest and satisfaction. As a 
vindication of your character and conduct, it was to me wholly 
unnecessary, for I have never entertained the slightest doubt of 
the perfect correctness of the motives of your vote in the recent 
presidential election. I have considered it as a new proof of 
your integrity, independence, and firmness. Pardon me if I add, 
that if your vote had been other than it was, I would have found 
it somewhat difficult to have reconciled it with your known 
public opinions on subjects intimately connected with executive 
duties. 

I have no doubt that the address will meet with general approbation, I do not say among warm partisans of other candidates, but among reflecting, considerate men of all parties. In 
this part of the Union it has received unqualified praise, and has 
given a new luster to your public fame. 

I hope you may long live to enjoy the confidence of the nation, and to remain a blessing to the country ; and I beg you 
will do me the favor of numbering me among those who cherish 
with the sincerest pleasure every expression of public regard 
toward you. 



LEWIS CASS TO MR. CLAY. 

Detroit, April 14, 1825. 

Dear Sir, I have just finished the perusal of your masterly 
address to your late constituents, and I can not refrain from expressing to you the high satisfaction it has aflbrded me. It is a 

triumphant refutation of the vile slanders which have been 
propagated respecting the motives of your conduct in the peculiar circumstances in which you were recently placed. You 
may safely commit your character to the judgment of your 
countrymen, and of posterity. They will not fail to award you 
full justice. 

I must ask your indulgence for this almost involuntary tribute 
to your claims and services. So strong is the impression which 
your appeal has made upon me, that I could not restrain this expression of my feelings. 



PRESIDENT HOLLEY TO MR. CLAY. 

Teansylvania Untveesitt, April 18, 1825. 

Dear Sir, ^I am much obliged to you for a copy of your address to your late constituents. It appears to me to be able, 
frank, and satisfactory. Your immediate friends did not need 
such a communication to keep them from yielding to the calumnies which were heaped upon you for the independent and magnanimous com'se that you pursued in regard to the election of 
the President. The publication, however, will, I am convinced, 
do great good, or rather has done it already. There is but one 
sentiment upon the subject in this vicinity, so far as comments 
have reached my ears. All are satisfied with the facts and the 
reasonings. I have no doubt that there are some among us, who 
would be better pleased, if you had not defended yourself, or if 
you had made your statement with less calmness, judgment, and 
ability. This number can not be great. 

I have just read the correspondence between yourself and Mr. 
Eaton. I am blinded, or it was weakness in him to publish it. 
He has left the community to believe that he was concerned in 
Kremer's conspiracy, even to a greater extent than might otherwise have been supposed. He appears to begin with a demand 
for explanation, which is given only in reference to the first letter, and ends the correspondence without obtaining any satisfaction upon some of the most material points, and with new evidence fastened upon him of connivance, and indeed of active 
exertions in the base affair. I at first regretted to see Mr. Eaton's 
name in your address, but he has now shown himself worthy of 
reprobation from the community. 
 


JAMES BKOWN TO MR. CLAY. 

Pasts, May 10, 1825. 

Dear Sir, I received your letter of the 29th March, inclosing 
one directed to Mr. Schaffer, acknowledging, on the part of the 
House of Representatives, the receipt of his excellent portrait 
of our good friend. General Lafayette, presented to that body. 
This letter I delivered to Mr. Schatfer on the 5th instant, and at 
the same time intimated to him, in such terms as could in no way compromise the House, that you had been restrained only 
by the advice of General Lafayette and his son, from making a 
movement toward a more suitable return for that valuable present. Mr. Schaffer expressed his entire approbation of the course 
which had been recommended by his friends, and assured me 
that the acknowledgment had been made in the manner most 
agreeable to his feelings and wishes. 


PRESIDENT KIRKLAND TO MR. CLAY. 

Harvard University, Cambridge, September 22, 1825. 

Dear Sir, I have the honor of informing you, that the government of Harvard University did, at the last Commencement, 
in expression of their sense of your professional and general attainments, and your distinguished character and standing, confer 
on you the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. 

The diploma will be made out and sent to you. In the hope 
of your favorable consideration of this token of our respect, I 
have the honor to be, etc. 


MR. ADAMS TO MR. CLAY. 

Boston, October 12, 1825. 

Dear Sir, I have received two letters from you, and several 
packets from the Department of State, concerning the contents 
of which I have thought it advisable to wait mitil I could have 
the pleasure of conferring personally with you. There is in my 
mind but one objection to the appointment which you suggest, 
and that is perhaps removed at least by the authority of respectable precedent. Although detained here longer than I had intended, I still purpose to be with you, at the latest, by the 25tli 
instant. 

I inclose, addressed to you, thirty and ten blank patents signed 
by me, received yesterday from Dr. Thornton, for my signature. 

I pray you to present my kind respects to Governor Barbour, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rir" rel="colleague met">Mr. Rush</a>, and Mr. Southard, from each of whom I have received letters, which perpetual motion has prevented me from 
answering. 


ALBERT GALLATIN TO MR. CLAY. 

BaltdiIOke, November 14, 1825. 

Dear Sir, No one can be more sensible than I am, both of 
the importance of laying the foundation of a permanent friendship between the United States and our sister Republics, and of 
the distinguished honor conferred on the persons selected to be 
the representatives of our glorious and happy country at the first 
Congress of the Independent Powers of this hemisphere ; but, 
without affecting any false modesty, I can not perceive that I am 
peculiarly fitted for that mission, either by knowledge of the 
language, things, or men, of South America, or by being known 
to them. My personal objection has already been stated. I 
had none, whatever, to a sea voyage, or to embarking from an 
Atlantic port. On the receipt of your friendly letter of the 11th, 
I had further private inquiries made from one thoroughly acquainted with the country, as if the object had been a commercial establishment, and without my name being mentioned. 
The result of these, and the decided opposition I would have to 
encounter in my family, compel me, though with great reluctance, to persist in declining the appointment. I will preserve a 
grateful sense of your's and the President's favorable disposition 
in my favor ; and I beg you to accept my thanks for your friendly 
conduct toward me on this occasion. 


LORD BEXLEY TO MU. CLAY. 

Gkeat George STr.KET, London, March 9, 1826. 

Sir, Having some time ago been informed, by Bishop Chase, 
that you would permit small parcels of the periodical publications of some of our religious and charitable societies, for his 
use, to be occasionally addressed to you, I have taken the liberty, 
by the favor of Mr. Kmg, to consign two small packages, containing a few Mohav/k Prayer Books and some Reports, to your 
address for the Bishop. 

I can not forbear taking this opportunity of expressing my 
sincere pleasure that a statesman in your eminent situation should 
be the friend of that excellent man ; and I can not conceive a 
purer or stronger bond of union between our countries than that 
 

which is afforded by the co-operation now so happily established 
between them in religious and benevolent pursuits. I am sure 
you will find the patronage you afforded them not only an honor 
to your Government, but a source of sincere and incxeasing satisfaction to yourself amid the cares and labors of an official life ; 
and which you will hereafter reflect upon as not among the least 
important of the services which your talents and character have 
enabled you to render to your country. I have the honor to be, 
Sir, with every sentiment of consideration, yours, etc. 


GENERAL JESUP TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, April 1, 1826. 

Sm, Agreeably to your request, I called this morning on Mr. 
Randolph, for the purpose of delivering your note. Previous to 
presenting it, however, I thought it proper to ascertain from him 
whether the information you had received, that he considered 
himself personally accountable for any attack upon you, was correct. I accordingly informed him that I was the bearer of a 
message from you, in consequence of an attack which, you had 
been informed, he had made on your private as well as public 
character, in the Senate ; that I was aware of the fact that he 
could not be made accountable elsewhere for any thing said in 
debate, unless he chose himself to waive his privilege as a member of that body. Mr. Randolph replied, that the Constitution 
did protect him, but he would never shield himself under such 
a subterfuge as the pleading of his privilege as a Senator from 
Virginia ; that he did hold himself accountable " to Mr. Clay," 
but considered that he (Mr. Clay) had first two pledges to redeeiii. One that he was bound to fight any member of the 
House of Representatives who had acknowledged himself the 
author of a certain publication in a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> paper ; the 
other, that he stood pledged to establish certain facts in regard 
to "a great man," whom he would not name. He added, however, that he would receive no message from Mr. Clay which 
was not in writing. I replied that the only message I had was 
in writing ; that I had not been authorized by you to enter into 
or receive any verbal explanations, but that I had done so on my 
own responsibility, because I thought it proper to do so. I then 
presented him the note. He read it, and informed me that he 
would send, by a friend, a written answer to it, or he would send 
the answer by me, if I would take it. I observed that it would 
be better to send it by a friend, to which he assented. 



GENERAL JESUP TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, June 24, 1826. 
Dear Sir, I inclose a copy of the paper which I read to you 
to-day ; it was drawn up with a view of being presented to you, 
within half an hour after yout note had been presented to Mr. 
Randolph. It contains the substance of my interview with that 
gentleman. 



GENERAL JESUP TO JA3IES B. CLAY.* 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 19, 1853. 

My DEAR Sir, I have received your letter of the 4th instant. 
You owe me no apology for writing to me on any subject ; 
certainly not when the matter relates to your late father. 

I have never seen Garland's book, but the statement which 
you understood him to have made, that Mr. Randolph, in the 
duel with your father, did not fire at him, is entirely incorrect. 
In that affair, when the parties came upon the ground. Colonel 
Tatnal, the friend of Mr. Randolph, having won the choice of 
positions, placed his principal in that which he preferred, and I 
placed your father opposite to him, distant ten paces. The other 
party, having the choice of positions, gave me the word. Mr. 
Randolph desired to know how I would give it when the parties 
should be ready. I repeated it. He desired to hear it again. 
While I was repeating it the second time, his pistol was aischarged, whether by accident or not I was then in doubt, but I 
was soon satisfied that the discharge was accidental. Your father called to me " It was an accident I saw it." The parties resumed their stations, and exchanged shots, Mr. Randolph's 
ball striking a small stump in the rear of, and nearly in line with 
your father, and his ball cutting Mr. Randolph's pantaloons near 
the knee, and passing through his coat. The parties again took 
their stations, and the word was given by Colonel Tatnal 
your father fired at Randolph, his bullet passing again through 
Mr. Randolph's clothes ; the latter raised his pistol and fired in 
the air, exclaiming at the moment, " Mr. Clay, I came upon this 
ground determined not to fire at you, but the unfortunate discharge of my pistol, after I had taken my position" (and I think 
he added, " with the circumstances attending it"), " for a moment changed my mind." They sprang forward as if by a 
common impulse, and grasped each other by the hand, each expressing the pleasure he felt that the other was unhurt. 

A statement, prepared at the time and signed by the friends 
of the parties, was published, giving an account of the whole 

* It is thought proper to put this letter in this place, though of a later date. 
 

matter. I have duplicates of all the correspondence, carefully 
packed among my private papers. I will open them, and have 
them copied for you, as soon as I shall find time to examine 
them. The other set of the papers, I have understood, was 
placed by Colonel Tatnal in the hands of Mr. Randolph's half 
brother, the late Judge Henry St. George Tucker, of Virginia, 
and was soon after destroyed by fire when his house was burned. 
I will examine Garland's book, and take such public notice 
of the part to which you refer as truth and justice may seem 
to require. With respect and regard, I am, etc. 



MR. ADAMS TO MR. CLAY. 

Quincy, September 12, 1826. 

Dear Sir,-^I duly received your kind letters of the 25th and 
30th of July, and of the 12th ultimo, all from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, which 
I have hitherto deferred answering, from an uncertainty where 
a letter would meet you. But supposing you would, about this 
time, reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, I, two days since, inclosed to you a 
letter from the Governor of New York, with other papers, on a 
subject requiring at once mature deliberation and prompt decision. 

I learn, with much concern, that your health did not derive, 
from your visit home, so much benefit as you had anticipated. 
I hope the tour to the Springs will have more favorable results. 
Your apprehensions with regard to Mr. Anderson were but too 
well founded. The public have lost in him an able and useful 
officer. The Panama Congress, it seems, have adjourned to 
meet in the neighborhood of the city of Mexico. 

Your letter of instructions to Mr. Gallatin has been forwarded 
by me to the Collector of the Customs at New York, to be forthwith transmitted. Mr. Poinsett's treaty with Mexico has all 
the articles stipulating the delivery of criminals and fugitive 
slaves, which Mr. Gallatin thinks may be objected to. We shall 
have an opportunity, by the reference of the Mexican Treaty to 
the Senate, of ascertaining their views in relation to these subjects, and, probably, in season to give further instructions to 
Ml-. Gallatin, before the termination of his negotiation. 

I think that, unless some unforeseen emergency should indispensably require my return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> earlier, I shall be 
there between the 15th and 20th of next month, about ten days 
later than I have, until recently, expected. 



LORD GAMBIER TO MS. CLAY. 

Iter Grove, September 20, 1826. 

My dear Sir, MR.Edward Thomson, the son of an esteemed 
and intimate friend of mine, being about to proceed to the State 
of South Carolina, will pass a little time at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, on his 
way from New York. I beg your permission to introduce him 
to your countenance and protection. You will find him, should 
he have the honor of presenting himself to you, to be an intelligent, well-informed young man, of most respectable character, 
and worthy of your notice. Any friendly office that you may 
please to honor him with, will be very gratifying and obliging 
to me. 

I was happy to hear, from my nephew, Mr. Charles Gambler, 
who visited <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> the beginning of the present year, of 
your health and well-being. Most cordially do I wish you a 
continuance of the same, with the addition of every other blessing that may conduce to your present and everlasting happiness ; 
being, my dear sir, with unfeigned esteem and regard, your faithful friend. 


PORTER CLAY* TO MR. CLAY. 

I 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a>, February 22, 1827. 

Dear Brother, Your favor of the 3d instant came to hand 
in due time, and I heartily thank you for the valuable inclosures, particularly your speech before the Colonization Society. 
Your views upon that subject have my most hearty concurrence, 
and I pray Almighty God may bless the institution with his approbation, and make it the means of extending the light of his 
glorious Gospel into that benighted land ; that Ethiopia may 
stretch out her hands to God, and the isles of the sea be made to 
rejoice in the fullness of his free salvation. You are right when 
you say that " God may convert that which has been our great 
sin into an extensive blessing to that people" not that we 
should be encouraged to do evil that grace may abound ; God 
forbid : for how then should God judge the world? But that we 
through his all-wise providence should get to himself a revenue 
of glory by that which in us was originally wicked. 

* Mr. Clay's brother, a Baptist minister, since dead. 


JAMES MADISON TO SIR. CLAY. 

MoNTPELiER, Marcli 24, 182Y. 

Dear Sir, After your kind offer, I make no apology for inclosing another letter, which I wish to have the advantage of a 
conveyance from the Department of State. Its object is to obtain from Mr. Gallatin a small service for our university, and 
that with as little delay as may be. 

While I was charged with the Department of State, the British doctrine against a neutral trade with belligerent ports, shut 
in peace and open in war, was examined at some length, and 
the examination published in a stout pamphlet. I have been 
applied to by several friends for a copy, which I could not furnish, nor do I know that they are attainable, unless obsolete copies 
should remain in the Department. If this be the case, I should 
be thankful for the means of complying with the application. 

Mrs. Madison joins in offering to Mrs. Clay and yourself assurances of cordial regards and best wishes. 


ALBERT GALLATIN TO MR. CLAY. 

London, May 3, 182'7. 

Sir, Mr. Colc[uhoun, the agent of the Hanse Towns in 
London, called on me yesterday, and informed me that the city 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a> having given her consent to that measure, the 
Hanse Towns had appointed Mr. Rumph their Charge d'Affaires 
at Paris, special minister to the United States, with power to negotiate a treaty of commerce, that he had accepted, and intended 
to sail from Havre for America, in the middle of August. 

Mr. Colquhoun also said that he was charged by the city of 
Hamburg, to obtain from me a communication of the answer I 
might receive from my Government, to the note of Mr. Sieveking, which I had transmitted at his request. I said that, having 
informed that gentleman that I had no authority or instructions 
on that subject, he had sent me this note in question, as an unofficial paper, that I had transmitted it as such, and that, under 
these circumstances, I did not think it probable that an answer 
would be made by my Government to that communication. 
The Government of the Hanse Towns is very economical ; the 
sending a minister abroad, is for them an extraordinary measure, 
and as three months will elapse before Mr. Rumph's intended dell 

parture, I suppose they would wish to know whether there is a 
reasonable prospect of his succeeding. 

It appeared to me, from the general tenor of the conversation, 
that not only are the Hanse Towns anxious of concluding a 
treaty of commerce with the United States, on account of its immediate advantages, but that they believe that it will have a tendency to increase the consideration in which they are held, and 
to strengthen the tenure on which they hold their situation of 
independent Republics. I said, of course, nothing that could 
commit my Government, but adverted in general to the liberal 
commercial policy adopted by the United States, and to their 
friendly disposition and feelings toward the free commercial 
cities of Germany. It is not probable that you will have any 
difficulty with them, as relates to either commerce or navigation, 
as generally understood. But you are undoubtedly aware that 
they are very narrow and selfish, as regards merchants residing 
within their own precincts, and that they may be unwilling to 
grant to citizens of the United States, who might be desirous 
of forming commercial establishments in any of those cities, the 
same privileges which foreign merchants indiscriminately enjoy, 
in common with our own citizens in the ports of the United 
States where they reside. 



BARON DE MAREUIL TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, June 30, 182T. 

Sir, At the moment when I am about to depart, permit me 
to add to my official communications of this day, some more 
particular expression of the sentiments which I bear away with 
me, and the better part of which is assured to you. I have 
often regretted that conversation was not more easy between us, 
being persuaded of the interest and pleasure which you would 
have been able to throw over it, and eager as I would have been 
to make myself understood in those things of which the pen can 
not treat, but in which the heart and spirit may find satisfaction. 
I hope, however, that I may not have been misunderstood by 
you, and that I have made an impression upon you akin to that 
which you have left on me. 

The extensive and beautiful tour which I have just finished, 
has much increased my admiration of North America. I have 
 

regretted that I was not at Black Rock, and that I was unable to 
deliver, in person, to General and Mrs. Porter, the recommendations with which you honored me. Madame Mareuil begs that 
Mrs. Clay will be pleased to accept her adieus and compliments. 
I venture to add my homage, and to beg. Sir, that you will accept, at the same time, with my thanks for the welcome treatment which I received from you during my residence in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, the assurance of the invariable sentiments of high consideration which I have professed for you. 


franklin LITCHEIELD to MR. CLAY. 

Puerto Cabello, Colombia, July 30, 1827. 

Sir, I do myself the pleasure to transmit to you a case, containing the bust of President Bolivar, which is a most perfect 
likeness of this great South American statesman. This is the 
first copy ever taken of him in this style, and was lately executed by an Italian, at the city of Caracas, and I beg of you to 
accept the same in my name, as a token of respect for your disinterested and patriotic eloquence, displayed on the floor of Congress, in defense of the rights and independence of the native 
.country of this distinguished liberator. Mr. Royal Phelps, Jr., 
is charged with the delivery of said bust, in person, and if you 
have no objections, I have requested him to have a portrait painting taken from it, in oleo, by one of our first artists. I have 
also requested Mr. Phelps to make several inquiries of you relating to my consular duties, and beg of you the favor to communicate to him your views frankly. 



SA3IUEL L. SOUTHARD TO MR. CLAY. 

Watnesborough, August 8, 1827. 

My dear Sir, You have set the whole world in commotion 
— never did one speech produce such an effect. It meets almost 
universal approbation, and with the wise and good there is no 
exception. I think they praise it loo much, good as it is a 
little envy, you know, is sometimes pardonable. I am informed 
that General J. has given an answer to your letter shall see it 
in the morning at Staunton. It is said to be mild, and to give 
up B. as the man. 

I am satisfied that a rapid change is taking place in this State, 
and my hopes that even Virginia will be with us have been 
confirmed ; they grow stronger every day. I find many men 
with us whom I looked upon as aliens. You may depend that 
I shall endeavor to encourage the process which is going on 
Can not you give me some good news at the White Sulphm ? 


R. P. LETCHER TO MR. CLAY. 

Lancaster, August 2*7, 1827. 

My dear Sir, Yours ol the 9th instant came to hand last 
nigbt. The one by Mr. A., I received a few days since by 
private hand, from the county of Harlan. With your letter of 
the 9th, Mr. Buchanan's response to the hero was received. This 
answer is well put together. As they say, in Connecticut, 
" there is a great deal of good reading" in Buck's reply. It is 
modest and genteel, yet strong and conclusive. I am truly delighted with the manner in which B. has acquitted himself. I 
really feared and believed he was placed in such a dilemma, by 
the General, that he could not extricate himself with any sort 
of credit. But he has come forth victoriously. I am greatly 
gratified with the result, and must believe it will have a happy 
effect upon the Presidential election. It is impossible it should 
turn out otherwise. Virginia, after this, will not can not support the General. I never had the least hope of Virginia until now. 

I presume Buck's reply supersedes the necessity of any reference to the conversation in my room. I am glad of it. 


MB. BARBOUR TO MR. CLAY. 

Barboursviile, August SO, 1S2'7. 

Dear Sir, The inclosed paper was delivered me yesterday 
by a servant, who immediately disappeared on its delivery ; so 
that I know not from whom it comes.* Yet the information it 

* Mr. Clay endorses the envelope thus : " Supposed to be from T. J. E." The 
result will be found on pages 1*74, 115. 
 

contains, and the anxiety manifested by the writer, induce me to 
transmit it by the earhest opportunity afforded by the mail. 

Mad as R is, I can scarcely believe he will move in the 

subject. But surely you can have no difficulty in deciding, 
should he do so, to treat his call with contempt. 

If you have any thing new, let me hear from you. 



STRICTLY CONTIDENTIAL, 

Wednesday Morning, August 28. 

Dear Sir, I should be wanting in common gratitude toward 
Mr. Clay, for the interest evinced by him in Mrs. Randolph, if I 
did not make every endeavor to apprise him in time of a piece 
of news which came to my ears yesterday afternoon. 

I happened to go to Charlottesville, and there h-eard of the 
piece in the " National Journal," and that Colonel Randolph had 
left there, intending to take the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> stage of yesterday 
afternoon, on his way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, determined that he would 
make Mr. Clay fight him. He was exceedingly exasperated, 
and, as you know, is capable of any violence. 

The northern stage had already been gone several hours, when 
this news was communicated to me, and my first impression was 
that Colonel Randolph had gone in that. After a good deal of 
painful perplexity in endeavoring to fix on a course which would 
reconcile my duty, as a member of this family, to Mr. Clay, with 
necessary secrecy (for were it ever to come to his ears, or even 
suspicion, that I had taken this step, the consequence would be 
an immediate explosion against me), I determined on riding 
down to Barboursville in the night. Having ascertained that 
you were probably there, and supposing that you could possibly 
send oif a messenger by the same stage, to Mr. Clay. 

Having ascertained that he was to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> via <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, I changed my plan. I inquired at the Post-office how far 
the northern stage went that night. Came home, wrote a hasty 
letter to Mr. Clay, inclosed it in one to Mr. Wirt (to avoid having it known in the neighborhood that any letter had been 
written under such suspicious circumstances to Mr. Clay), on the 
back of which I desired any one of Mr. Wirt's family to open 
the letter sent it off by a confidential servant. This morning 
he brings me back the letter, with the disheartening intelligence 
that the stage, instead of stopping for the night at the house 
where I was informed at the Post-office that it put up, had left 
there an hour or two before sunset. 

I should myself ride to Barboursville this morning, but for the 
certainty" of this visit becoming known in the neighborhood, 
and thus bringing on consequences which would, in the present 
state of the family be deplorable to them, independently of any 
anxiety which I may, or may not entertain to avoid his ire on 
my own account. 

Were you, sir, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, I should desire you to be on 
your guard, for you are an object of deadly aversion. 

This is written for no eyes or ears but yours and Mr. Clay's. 
Burn it, if you please, as soon as read. 
• In great haste, yours with grateful respect, 

On second thoughts, I obliterate my name, that you may answer to any inquiries, the letter is anonymous, and also without 
any date as to place. 



THOMAS M. RANDOLPH TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, September 1, 182'7. 

Sir, Upon what I think sufficient ground, I believe that you 
have, several times since the month of December, 1824, made 
use of expressions, insulting in their purport, and injurious in 
their consequences with regard to me. 

I believe that by such expressions, and by unjust representations, you occasioned that conduct toward me from the Department of War, which defeated the object of my mission to Florida, last winter. 

Lastly, I believe that you are the author of the piece in the 
"National Journal" of last Saturday, August 25th, in which 
such abusive language is used toward me. 

With respectful feelings I call upon you to declare whethei 
my belief be well-founded, or not, in each of the cases stated. 



FROM MR. clay's MOTHER, ELIZABETH WATKINS. 

Woodford, Kentucky, September 13, 182Y. 

My dear Son, Your kind favor of the 14th of August last, 
by mail, came safe to hand a few days ago. I feel glad that 
you have got again to the bosom of your family, and found 
them all well. Rest assured, my son, I have been a great deal 
worse since you last saw me than I was when I had the pleasure 
of seeing you. I am still very low. I can make out to walk 
across the house with the help of a cane, or some one to help 
me. I feel to-day somewhat better, having had a good night's 
rest. My cough is not as bad as it has been. Your aunt Moss 
is very poorly, and has been for two or three weeks ; also, her 
son Philip is very low ; at present, there is very little hope of 
their recovery. Mr. Blackburn has been very poorly, but is 
getting better, so that he is able to attend to his business. 
Your sister is well. As to your brother John, I have not seen 
him for twp weeks ; I expect him in a few days ; he was quite 
well when he left mo. Mr. Watkins still enjoys his usual 
health, but much worn out by attending on me, both night and 
day. Mr. Watkins joins me in love to you and Lucretia, and 
the rest of the family. Pray, my son, write me when convenient : and that God may bless you all, is the sincere prayer of 
your mother. 


TO MR. CLAY. 

[The following proposal to Mr. Clay, from the State of New 
York, dated October 22, 1827, over a signature which we think 
proper to suppress, is indorsed in Mr. Clay's hand as follows : 
'' I v/as shocked by the proposal in this letter, and need not say, 
that it was impossible to comply with it."] 
 

What I would now beg leave to suggest for your consideration 
is, the propriety of addressing me a letter on that subject, of the 
date of November, 1824, about the time we met to • choose electors, and after your return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. It might be so worded as to be in answer to my inquiries on that head, which, with 
your liberty, I would publish. It would be a knock-down argument against your bitter enemies. It is at you the fatal blow is 
aimed, and not Mr. Adams ; if they succeed against you, they 
well know that Adams will inevitably fall with you. He would 
become an easy prey, and could not stand a moment. 

I trust you will not be offended at my suggestion, whether 
you approve or disapprove of it, when I assure you that I am 
actuated through motives of friendship a friendship, sir, that 
can not easily be shaken. Should you think proper to make 
the communication, it shall be sacred. 


CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, January 5, 1828. 

Dear Sir, I thank you for the copy of your address on the 
charges made against you respecting the election of President, 
which I have read with the more pleasure because it combines 
a body of testimony much stronger than I had supposed possible, 
which must I think silence even those who wish the charge to 
be believed. 

With sincere wishes for the improvement of your health, and 
with real esteem I am, dear sir, yours, etc. 



JAMES MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

MoTPELiEK, January 6, 1828. 

Dear Sir, I have duly received the copy of your address 
politely forwarded to me. Although I have taken no part in the 
depending contests, and have been led to place myself publicly 
on that ground, I could not peruse the appeal you have made 
without being sensible of the weight of testimony it exhibits, 
and of the eloquence by which it is distinguished. 

Having occasion to write to MR.Brougham [since Lord 
Brougham] on a subject which interests our University, I take 
the liberty of asking your friendly attention to the letter which 
I inclose. I hope it may find an early conveyance from the Department of State, with dispatches about to be destined for London, Should this not be the case MR.Brent will save you the 
trouble of giving the intimation, that a duplicate may seek some 
other channel. It is desirable that the letter should reach Mr. 
Brougham with as little delay as may be. 
 



MR. VAUGHAN TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 19, 1828. 

My dear Sir, I thank you for your loan of the message of 
the Governor of Maine, and as I am still disappointed of being 
able to procure a copy of it through the newspapers, I take the 
liberty of asking your permission to keep your copy. If you 
can not conveniently allow me to do so, I will return it immediately. 



. JAMES BARBOUR TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 2T, 1828. 

Dear Sir, I regret much as an apparent evidence of neglect 
the non-arrival of my letter to you and Colonel Mercer, in time. 
I intentionally delayed writing till the last moment, under a high 
hope of giving you some determinate information of the person 
best to present for the Vice-Presidency ; but it was still in time 
for the period proposed by Colonel Mercer for his departure. 
Your own just views made the accident of no consequence. 
Here and every where your proceedings have been most favorably received. You did nobly. If Virginia is not mad beyond 
cure, she will yet be saved. We are in high expectations of 
Pennsylvania. Sergeant speaks with great confidence. In fine 
our prospects are evidently brightening. We are looking with 
intense curiosity as to Madison's course. The Opposition are in 
difficulty with their resolution of inquiry as to abuses the 
friends of the Administration challenge them to proceed. If 
they recede they will be obliged to admit that the slanders of 
profligacy are groundless. If they proceed they will find the 
most economical Administration of the public affairs since the 
 

establishment of the Government. is a man just from 

the woods, and his resokition was for mere home consumption. 
One of his political associates warned the house, that young 
doctors always killed their patients. That the parties were too 
equal to admit of experiments and he should not be surprised 

if by this tampering killed them. Let me hear from you 

occasionally. 



FRANCIS BROOKE TO jm. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, February 28, 1828. 

My DEAR Sir, I have received answers to my circular from 
Mr. Madison and MR.Monroe, which you will see in " The Whig" 
next week. They decline to accept the appointment, as was 
apprehended, though with the expression of sentiments, if not 
perverted, rather flattering to the friends of the Administration. 
The fact is, that they have used an expression susceptible of 
construction more favorable to G neral Jackson than was intended. They speak of the high estimation in which they hold 
both of the candidates, which may be interpreted now, and not 
then, as was intended. 
 

REV. ISAAC BARD TO MR. CLAY. 

Greenville, Kentucky, March 27, 1828. 

Dear Sir, I know you will not think it strange if an unknown friend should address a letter to you. Have you not 
given yourself to your beloved country, devoted yourself to her 
cause, and may not the citizen claim you as his property and 
inheritance ? If so, why should an humble citizen be shy and 
stand aloof from him whom he has long loved and admired ? 

Will you be so kind as to indulge me in some desultory re 
marks ? When I was pursuing my education in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, I 
first heard you deliver an oration at the laying of the cornerstone of the Hospital. As a student and a boy I was much 
pleased. Once on Poplar Row, on the pavement, I met you and 
there were none else on the whole street, and you spoke to me 
so politely and friendly, it, though a little thing, made no small 
impression. The next time I saw you was when I was on at 

College and the Divinity School, you passed through Princeton, 
sitting by the driver on an outside seat of the stage, spoke to Mr. 
Wm. Warfield, who was with me coming up street. To say the 
least, the way you spoke to him (an acquaintance) impressed me 
that you, in no ordinary degree, were a man of friendly feeling, 
of openness and urbanity of manners. 

But it is not merely the pleasing qualifications and attractions 
of private character, your eloquence and ratiocination, the boon 
of God, but your political course, and those important national 
principles of internal improvement, smiling on rising Republics, 
that enhance you in the approbation and give you such a scope 
in the affections of your fellow citizens. You have already established an imperishable reputation. A wreath of evergreens 
encircles your brow, and will entwine around your name while 
time shall last. Your reputation, the storms of persecution have 
tried to carry away ; but it is built on a basis that moldering 
ages can not waste. Ethiopia will remember your colonization 
efforts. South America and Greece will couple yoiu' name with 
liberty and independence. Your Tariff speech of 1824 has 
opened the eyes of the American people, and they will not forget 
you. Roads, and canals, and manufactures, in fine, the American system, will hail you as their founder and father. Sir, if I 
understand flattery it is stating what is false ; but I believe I am 
telling the truth. Truth that is already written in American 
history written in the hearts and affections of the American 
people, more indellible than letters engraven on adamant. 

For many years I have read with pleasure your speeches and 
observed your public course. I have witnessed with heart-burning and disgust the vituperation and slander of ambitious, wicked 
men. In private conversation I have often pleaded your cause, 
and that of the President, and of your policy. I approve 
heartily of your course. When my friend told me that Mr. 
Adams was President, and you had voted for him, a sudden exultation of joy flashed through my bosom. 

We (of Greenville) had a large number of your defenses 
printed at Russelville, and I have spread them from my store far 
and wide (for I am a merchant and Presbyterian preacher). Be 
assured they are operating powerfully. It is the best antidote 
against lying and slander that has ever been used. Many of the 
Jackson men of this county (Muhlenberg) have turned completely around. We are decidedly Administration here, by a very 
large majority. I hope you and Mr. Adams will not be discom*aged, but keep up good spirits. 

In writing you this letter I mean no more than an expression 
of my friendship for you, my country, the prosperity of the 
nation, and the welfare of civil and religious liberty. I am in 
the habit of praying for you in secret and in public. If I have 
any interest at the court of Heaven, I have tried to make it for 
you. Think ; they didn't say, at HopkinsviUe,they knew I was 
an Administration man from my prayer, as I prayed for the 
President, etc. But it is not a cause I am ashamed or afraid of; 
for if even " Old Hickory" should be elected, we will not give 
up you. You must come next. You are consecrated to your 
country and you are ours. 

Permit me to say, I have named my first-born son Henry Clay 
Bard. I did it for two reasons : 1. As a mark of affection and 
friendship for you ; 2. That your character might stimulate him 
to worthy deeds. 

Will you be so good as to give my respects to Mrs. Clay. Will 
you be so good as to give my respects to the President, Mr. 
Adams. Tell him I pray for him and hie Cabinet. May God 
bless Mr. Clay. May God bless the President. May God guide 
and direct him and his counselors. May you all fear God, pray 
to him, keep his " commandments that it may be well with you." 


p. B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, July 15, 1828. 

Dear Sir, Notwithstanding I have been overwhelmed with 
business in the office, ever since you left here, I would have 
written you sooner, but that, from the accounts which Mrs. Clay 
has given me, at different times, of your progress, I calculate 
that you will not reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> sooner than this letter. 

For the first ten days of my official labor, or_, rather, reconnoissance, I found myself located in a field so entirely new and 
strange, that I could not move a single step without encountering some serious obstacle. I have now become familiarized to 
a small extent of ground, over which I move with tolerable ease, 
but my horizon is yet extremely circumscribed. I hope, however, to be able, by great assiduity, gradually to extend it. 

I call, almost daily, on the President, who treats me with great 
kindness. His health and spirits have, I think, both improved 
since you left us. 


CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, November 28, 1828. 

My dear Sir, In consequence of my inattention to the postoffice, I did not receive your letter of the 23d till yesterday afternoon. I need not say how deeply I regret the loss of Judge 
Trimble. He was distinguished for sound sense, uprightness 
of intention, and legal knowledge. His superior can not be 
found. I wish we may find his equal. You are certainly correct in supposing that I feel a deep interest in the character of 
the person who may succeed him. His successor willj of 
course, be designated by Mr. Adams, because he will be required to perform the most important duties of his office, before 
a change of administration can take place. 

Mr. Crittenden is not personally known to me, but I am well 
acquainted with his general character. It stands very high. 
Were I myself to designate the successor of Mr. Trimble, I do 
not know the man I could prefer to him. Report, in which 
those in whom I confide concur, declares him to be sensible, 
honorable, and a sound lawyer. I shall be happy to meet him 
at the Supreme Court as an associate. The objection I have to 
a direct communication of this opinion to the President arises 
from the delicacy of the case. I can not venture, unasked, to 
recommend an associate justice to the President, especially a 
gentleman who is not personally known to me. It has the appearance of assuming more than I am willing to assume. I must, then, notwithstanding my deep interest in the appointment, and my conviction of the fitness of Mr. Crittenden a conviction as strong as I could well feel in favor of a gentleman of whom I judge only from general character decline writing to the President on the subject. 
 

P. GUAL TO MR. CLAY. 

Tacubata, November 20, 1828. 

Esteemed Sir, I take the liberty to recommend Colonel 
Belford Wilson, a son of the illustrious friend of America, Sir 
Robert Wilson, to your attentions and civilities. This gentleman, after having conducted himself admirably well among us, 
returns now, with honor, to the bosom of his country and family. As he first thinks of visiting those States, I assure you that 
I will be very grateful for any demonstration of regard which 
you may have the goodness to bestow on him. 

It is with particular pleasure I avail myself of this occasion 
to renew to you the assurances of the ancient esteem and respect for your person, with which I am ever your aflfectionate 
and obedient servant. 


J. J. CRITTENDEN TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a>, December 3, 1828. 

Dear Sir, Though recent occurrences have a good deal depressed my spirits, my principles forbid me to despair. I have 
yet a strong confidence '' that truth is omnipotent, and public 
justice certain," and that you will live to hail the day of retribution and triumph. Your political enemies render involuntary 
homage to you, by their early and spontaneous apprehensions 
of your future elevation, and your friends find their consolation 
by looking upon the same prospect. The combination that has 
been formed against you will dissolve its leaders have too 
many selfish views of personal aggrandizement to harmonize 
long ; your friends will remain steadfast, bound to you more 
strongly by adversity ; you will, of necessity, be looked to as 
the great head and hope of the great mass that constitutes the 
present Administration party. This is the spirit already visible 
here, and I am sanguine of its final result. 

What an excellent philosophy it is which can thus extract 
good from evil consolation from defeat ! But enough of it. 

You will, of course, go on with the Administration to the last 
moment, as though Mr. Adams had been re-elected, and with all 
the good temper and discretion possible. But v/hat then ? 
That you should return to your district, and represent it again 
in Congress, seems to be the general wish and expectation of 
your friends here. It is certainly mine. 



RICHARD HENRY LEE TO MR. CLAY. 

Leesburg, January 23, 1829. 

Dear Sir, When I last enjoyed the honor of your company, 
I took the liberty of asking the favor of you, to prepare for me 
a list of all the treaties negotiated by yourself and by our foreign 
ministers, during your occupancy of the State Department. You 
were kind enough to promise me the enumeration I desired. I 
am obliged to you for the call of my attention to the principle 
you mentioned, so favorable to our navigation interests, and for 
the history of its introduction into our later treaties. 

Permit me to obtrude again on your attention, so far as to beg 
that, amid the various and important business constantly engaging 
your mind, you would not forget the memoranda I want. You 
will add to the favor, if you will attach a note to the name, etc., 
of any treaty, noticing any novel principle contained in it, and 
elucidating the history and the intention of its introduction, and 
its actual or probable effect upon our national interests and national relations. 

In composing the history I took the liberty of telling you I 
intend to write, if I have the leisure and opportunity of writing, 
I shall devote no small portion of it to the first Department under the Executive, and to the labors and character of its head. 
I say this, my dear sir, without any purpose of flattery or courtier-like spirit (my Republican spirit is above this), but because its concerns and the character and labors of its officer, of the 
period I shall be writing of, belong to the history and glory of 
my country. When I again have the pleasure of seeing you, I 
will take the liberty of submitting it to you, whether it would 
be your wish that an historian, if thought adequate to his task, 
should take any notice of the false and malicious imputations cast 
upon you and Mr. Adams, .of intrigue and corruption. For myself, I am inclined to think that to notice them would be beneath the dignity of history and of your characters. 


FRANCIS BROOKE TO MR. CLAY. 

RicniioND, February 23, 1829. 

My DEAR Sir, I hasten to answer your letter of to-day. 
The intelhgence it gives of the proposed Cabinet had reached 
here on yesterday, and filled the Jackson party with consternation. Some affect not to believe it, and some few to palliate it ; 
you will see the vote on the Tariff, the minority has increased 
from forty-nine to seventy-five, and would have been higher but 
for the absence of some members. You have not drawn the 
intended inference from any letter. There can be little doubt 
-5 

that a large portion of the Jackson party are favorable to you, at 
least, this is my information from every quarter. I think the 
people must say with Hamlet, " Look at this picture and look at 
that," and for this only has been the mighty strife. I confess I 
am myself disappointed. I thought General Jackson, if he could 
not get splendid talents and information, at least would have 
brought around him great moral worth, as those who have least 
of it are not insensible to its value. Feeling must have superseded this instinct. I think that now his future course will not 
be doubtful. He must put himself into the hands of the Secretary of State, who will be de facto, President, etc. 


MR. ADAMS TO MR. CLAY.

Meridian Hill, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, April 21, 1829. 

My dear Sir, Your favor of the 12th instant, inclosing a 
letter to you from Mr. Child, with your answer, has come to 
hand. The letter to Mr. Child has been forwarded to him as 
you desired. 

I have no design or wish that old party distinctions should be 
revived, and do not believe that they will or can be. A struggle 
 

by certain individuals of the old Federal party to recover the 
ascendency they had lost, may render a reaction of the Republicans necessary for their own defense ; it can be necessary fox 
no other purpose of which I am aware, and I have no wish to 
fortify myself by the support of any party whatever. 

The objection there appears to me to be against applying the 
denomination of Federalists to the opposers of protection to 
manufactures and internal improvement is, that I believe the 
fact to be otherwise. The old Federalists were generally friendly 
to those interests. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> was pre-eminently so. The 
remains of the Federal party now are divided upon those questions, as they are upon all others of present political interest. 
They have now no public principle peculiar to themselves. 

The Federalists have generally supported the measures of the 
two last Administrations. Those Administrations have adopted 
and practiced upon many of their favorite opinions. Most of the 
New England manufacturers are Federalists, and would hardly 
be gratified by the application of their names to their opponents. 

The composition of the new Administration indicates the intention to conciliate the South. Perhaps means will be found 
also of propitiating the West. New England will not be a 
favorite ; nor, it would seem, will Virginia ; but there is now no 
propensity to opposition in either. 

You will have time, between this and next August, to fix 
your opinion, whether it will be advisable for you to come to 
the House or not. I have no doubt your presence here will be 
salutary. But whether, at the present Congress, a seat in the 
House would conduce to your health or comfort may admit of 
doubt. 

Wherever you may be, you will have with you my respect 
and esteem. 



RICHARD HENRY LEE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, April 22, 1829. 

Dear Sir, From a late paper, I learn that you and your family have arrived at home, without accident. Permit me to express to you the pleasure this intelligence has given me. 

I was chagrined, that through misinformation of the time of 
yom- departure from this city, I did not enjoy the friendly privi
lege of presenting to you the parting assurances of my respect 
and remembrance. I felt this circumstance so much, that I determined to take the earliest opportunity of presenting them to 
you, which I do now, when they are as strongly entertained. 

No one, my dear sir, of your friends and fellow-citizens, has 
traced the course and incidents of your return to Kentucky with 
more interest and gratification than myself. '' I will not despair 
of the American Republic" while I observe the redeeming and 
purifying leaven which yet remains in her citizens. It is essentially diffusive, and will yet leaven the whole mass. It is not 
the frothy effervescence of sordid interest and ignorance, but the 
genuine risings of enlightened and fearless patriotism. To drop 
all figure, the gloom in which you left us here was dispelled by 
the events of your journey. I rejoiced in the testimonials of 
the confidence and gratitude of the country, so generously and 
enthusiastically offered you. They have cheered more than 
half a million of freemen, who, as you truly observed, are not 
surpassed by any body of men on earth, in civic virtues and intelligence. I was cheered with them, not only because they 
prove the sense of justice to be strong and fearless, but because 
they give us reason to hope that by concentrating all our efforts 
upon a statesman, we may yet be able to bring back the people 
to a just estimate of civil services, civil qualifications, and civil 
freedom. 

Mr. Adams (whom I have lately seen, in fine health and 
spirits) has very much gratified his friends by his letter to the 
citizens of New Jersey. The irony of the last paragraph was 
keen, and just toward him, who, on such an occasion, had the 
indecorum to charge him with corruption and abuse of office, 
and to libel half a million of his fellow-citizens. The truth 
and faithfulness of the portraits Mr. Adams has so glowingly 
drawn, have struck the public with a force which has exceedingly annoyed the unwilling beholders, whose eyes could not be 
altogether turned away from the brilliant colors and the striking 
resemblances. That letter has blistered the tribes of error in all 
their gradations. 

I can not but hope, my dear sir, that in considering- your own 
plans and views, and the wishes of your friends and fellow-citizens, you may decide that your duty requires you to appear again 
in public in the House of Representatives. Aside from all public views, which you are best able to take and correctly to 
 

weigh, it would afford me great gratification to be able to renew ' 
the personal intercourse with which you honored me. 

You have said, that " the country needed repose." However 
true this may be, / know that it is contemplated in Virginia, in 
less than two years, to accept your pledge to serve your country, 
which will be signified by public meetings, the number and 
character of which will be impressive to others, and imperative 
upon you. I expect to return to my native State in two years, 
and to mingle my efforts in giving impetus to these movements. 

I once mentioned to you my design of writing a History of 
the Administration of Mr. Adams. My relation, Mr. Fendall, 
had anticipated me. He will execute this just and grateful task, 
while we will compare our views and unite our researches. 



FRANCIS BROOKE TO MR. CLAY. 

St. Julien, April 29, 1829. 

My dear Sir, I may now congratulate you on your safe arrival with your family at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, and on your triumphal 
journey from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> to your peaceful home. The unsolicited and unbouglit respect and affection of numerous bodies of 
your fellow-citizens, must much enhance the feelings with 
which a consciousness of having discharged faithfully your duties to your country inspires you, and give an example to 
others which will stimulate them to do the like, in despite of 
the slanders that may annoy them. 



MR. ADAMS TO MR. CLAY. 

Meridian Hill, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, May 2, 1829. 

Dear Sir, ^I have received your obliging letters of the 16th 
and 19th ultimo, the latter covering a copy of my correspondence with the New Jersey Committee, printed upon satin. I am 
happy that my letter was satisfactory to you, and I have learned 
that it has been generally gratifying to our friends. There was 
a testimony due from me to all the members of the late Administration, and in a special manner to you. No better opportunity 
could have been afforded me to give it than that presented me 
by the New Jersey Address, and I availed myself of it with 
pleasure. 

The Catholic Question has assumed in England an aspect 
entirely new ; and is presenting appearances quite unexpected. 
Brought forward in Parhament by the Duke of Wellington and 
Mr. Peel, carried in the House of Commons by a majority of 
more than two to one, it is almost doubtful whether it will yet 
overpower the cry of "No Popery" in the House of Peers, among' 
the people, and with the king. Mr. Gallatin, who is here, and 
called upon me a few days since, thinks it will pass the House 
of Lords by a small majority. 

May 11, 1829. 

I was interrupted in the writing of this letter by information 
of a domestic calamity, of which you v/ill have seen some account in the newspapers, and which has disqualified me for the 
time even for the performance of some of the duties of social 
life. The loss of my eldest son has been followed by an aggravation of the infirm health of his mother, and by an effect upon 
my own spirits, calling for more than the consolations of philosophy. 

Mr. Southard, before he left this city, had met with an affliction similar in its nature, though not equally severe, in tlie loss 
of his youngest daughter. He has returned home, and, I have 
learned, is recovering his health. Mr. Ptush has sailed for England. 

I expect to leave this place toward the close of this month. 
I have no intercourse with any member of the Administration, 
and am a silent observer of passing events. 



JOHN L. LAWRENCE TO MR. CLAY. 

■ ■ • Ne\7 York, May 2, 1829. 

Dear Sir, Since our separation at Gottenburg, I have had 
but few opportunities of presenting myself to your remembrance, 
except in the way of recommending to your notice, personally or 
officially, some whom I deemed worthy of it. Let my motive 
excuse me for now obtruding on a subject, immediately relating 
to yourself, but interesting to the nation at large. 

A report reached us on the 30th ult., that a duel had been 
 

fought in which Mr. Pope was your antagonist, which terminated 
fatally to you. Although it came in so questionable a shape as 
to warrant disbelief, it filled the minds of our worthiest citizens 
with apprehensions of its truth. Idle as the arrival of successive mails has proved the rumor to be, it has forced the community to reflect, most seriously, on the consequences that would 
flow from the reality, and has created feelings, of which, I am 
*sure, you will not be regardless. 

In looking for relief from the evils, actual and prospective, to 
which an inconsiderate admiration of great military talent has 
exposed the country, the eyes of the largest portion of the intelligent and reflecting turn to you, as the instrument of our deliverance. From you, therefore, duties are manifestly owing of 
higher obligation than any purely personal. It is undoubtedly 
diflicult to repress the sensibilities of an honorable mind smarting under wrongs, and goaded by their repetition ; but the eflfort 
is noble in itself, and is imperatively demanded by your present 
relations to your fellow-citizens. The sentiment, that in a crisis 
like this, all private considerations should yield to our regard for 
the national welfare, is one to which you are pledged by repeated 
declarations. I submit, whether you have not thus oflered the 
guarantee of your personal reputation, that no matters merely 
affecting yourself shall tempt you to endanger the public cause ? 

It is not my intention to enter into prosing remarks on duelling, or to say that it never ought to be resorted to. Your own 
affair at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> was perhaps unavoidable, situated as you 
then were. But your position has materially changed with the 
times, and brings a corresponding change of obligation along 
with it. Public sentiment would now condemn what then it 
might excuse or even approve. The honest prejudices of the 
people exact from you a homage which need not before have 
been accorded. In a large section of the Union the practice is 
regarded with horror. In our own, where the pistol has been 
as fashionable and as fatal as elsewhere, appeals to it, as the arbiter, have become absolutely disreputable. Even in those States 
where duelling is yet countenanced, I apprehend that it is a 
necessary recourse only when one's character for personal courage might suffer by declining. This motive can not operate in 
your case. Were your worst enemy required to pronounce on 
that point he would probably censure you for being too chivalrous. 

Besides the considerations above stated, there is another demanding much attention. The new Administration is essentially 
belligerant ; and without a corps of sharp-shooters its arrangements would seem incomplete. It might, perad venture, be imagined by some self-constituted legion of honor, that your removal from " this world of woe" were a meritorious service ! 
If it be understood that you are to take the field whenever an 
adversary gives occasion, you may make up your mind to successive hazards of your life, until the catastrophe shall be accomplished. 

I have been thus plain, perhaps I ought to say abrupt, on this 
subject, because I have seen and felt how intimately it is connected with the best hopes of the country. A repetition of 
apology is needless to one of your own frank disposition. On 
that disposition I rely for permission to add my confidence, that 
if similar reports shall hereafter reach us, we may at once stamp 
them with discredit and denial. 


MR. VAUGHAN TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, July 1, 1829. 

My dear Sir, I return you my very best thanks for the 
promptitude with which you have executed my commission, and 
procured for me a genuine Kentucky rifle. I shall hope to receive it about the time of the meeting of Congress, if not before. 
I find the opportunities of sending any thing from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> 
 

to Kentucky by private hands rarely occur. I have long had in 
my possession, the portrait of a spaniel dog, lithographed, by a 
very young boy, the son of our friend Christopher Hughes. 
Among many copies which he sent to me to distribute among 
his friends at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, was one for Mrs. Clay. To send it 
by the post would be to risk spoiling it. Do suggest to me 
some means of forwarding it. 

I have a letter from Christopher Hughes, dated the 10th of 
May, when he was waiting with anxiety to know his fate, 
whether he was to be envoy's or renvoye. I am very sorry to 
know that by this time he must be aware that he is to be superseded by Mr. Preble, and I do not yet hear what other appointment he is likely to get. 

Mr. Ouseley is to embark on the 8th, at New York, for England, with the first statement on the part of the United States, 
respecting the Boundary Question, referred to arbitration. I 
think the statement well done. 

I am glad of an occasion of opening a communication with 
you. You will be glad to know that I am perfectly satisfied 
with the conduct and feelings of the present President, in all 
communications which I have had with his Government, as 
British minister. 

I leave it to others better informed than myself, to tell you the 
news of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. I am glad to find that you justly appreciate the conduct of the Duke of Wellington, in carrying through 
the Catholic Relief Bill. The difficulties were insurmountable 
for any other man. 

With kindest regards to Mrs. Clay and all your family, not 
forgetting Johnny, believe me ever yours, etc. 


ALEXIS DE SARCY* TO MR. CLAY. 

September 6, 1829. 

Sir, To address you directly through the mail is hazardous, 
and as I have information to communicate which I deem of importance as well to you personally as to the country, you may 
expect in a few days to hear from me, under cover to some 
friend in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. In that dispatch you will learn the mode 
of communicating with me. 

There is a Virginian at present residing in Franklin, in Louisiana, a Dr. John N. Field, he is an active zealous friend to you, 
and has influence which he uses freely ; he receives " The 
Focus;" send him " The Reporter." The cause derives benefit 
from his efforts. 


D. MALLORY TO MR. CLAY. 

New Yoek, November 2, 1829. 

Dear Sir, I had the pleasure of meeting your friend Mr. 
Johnson, the Senator of Louisiana, a short time since, and during 
our conversation, which related mostly to you, he advised my 
writing to you " fully and freely." 

You have known me a great many years, and during this long 
period of time, I think I can boast of having possessed your 
confidence to a flattering extent, considering my humble pretensions to influence. You have often honored me with your approbation, and have at various times given to my views and 
opinions attention and respect. If I have not succeeded in all 
respects to the extent my vanity and zeal had projected for 
your interest, I have the approbation of numerous acquaintances 
that industry and attention have not been spared to accomplish 
these views. 

I have but recently returned from a visit to several of the 
New England States, and my information is certainly cheering 
as it relates to you. In Boston, during a stay of nearly two 
weeks, I had various and highly interesting communications 
made to me on the state of public opinion. The result of these, 
and numerous others made at other times and in other States and 
places, is, that there is scarcely a doubt but that nearly all the 
States north and east of this will join heartily in your nomination. The excitement on this subject in these sections of the 
country is much greater than I had supposed. We can securely 
rely on Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont, and if by any casualty the " hero" is out of the question, 
no reasonable doubt can be entertained of the other two. 

The wish is very general that you should visit them during the ensuing summer. I do not, however, consider a visit to 
them half so important or politic as a visit to New York. Some 
time previous to the late Presidential election, while I had the 
honor of a seat in the City Convention, I introduced a resolution expressive of a wish that a committee should be formed to 
invite you to the city. At that time, and since, but one opinion 
prevailed. It was unanimous among our party, and much good 
was anticipated by such an event. If it was deemed so important at that period, it surely is much more so now. 

Mr. Johnson informed me that he believed it was your inten? 
 

tion to visit General Porter next season ; if so, I trust you will 
not refuse us the gratification of a visit. Indeed, it will do much 
good. Thousands of people are anxious to see you, and among 
them are many leading' and influential men. 

I wrote to Mr. Smith, the editor of " The Reporter," a few 
days since, on the subject of a likeness of yourself, which I am 
about publishing from the portrait by Wood : will you do me 
the favor to request him to answer as early as his convenience 
will admit of it. I shall feel greatly honored and obliged by an 
early reply from yourself. 



MR. ADAMS TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, December 11, 1829. 

My dear Sir, On my return here from the North a few days 
since, I received your letter of the 23d October, written at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a>, and inclosing the printed copy of Mr. Jefferson's letter to Mr. Breckenridge of 12th August, 1803. It corresponds 
in opinion with his letter to Mr. Dunbar of nearly the same date, 
which had been published before. 

The sacrifice of principle, by Mr. Jefferson, in sanctioning the 
assumption by Congress of the power to do that which he thus 
acknowledges could rightfully be done only by an amendment 
to the Constitution, is destined to produce consequences from 
which 1 turn my eyes. 

I have written a reply to the Confederate Appeal of Mr. Giles' 
auxiliaries ; but have hitherto forborne to publish it. The 
friends to whom I have communicated it are not altogether 
agreed as to the expediency of its immediate publication, and I 
have cheerfully postponed it for the present. When published, 
[ shall not fail of transmitting a copy of it to you. 

I ofier you my warm and sincere thanks as well for your condolence as for your congratulations. I have had the pleasure 
this day of seeing Mr. Clarke, and of hearing from him the entire re-estabhshment of your health. I saw Mr. Southard last 
Saturday at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and rejoiced at meeting him quite recovered both in health and spirits. Mr. Brown is also at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> ; but my stay there was so short I did not see him. I 
heard that Mrs. Brown's health was much improved. 



MR. VAUGHAN TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, December 18, 1829. 
Mt dear Sir, Mr. Clark has delivered to me the rifle, and 
it seems to me to be, in workmanship, most perfect ; and I am 
as well pleased with it as any child you ever saw with a new 
toy. Mr. Glark and Mr. Letcher have promised to teach me how 
to use it, and it will not be my fault if we have not a field-day 
very soon. • 

Gratified, as I feel, by your kindness in executing the commission v/hich I took the liberty of giving you, to procure for 
me a genuine Kentucky rifle, which you have so admirably executed, it is very painful to me to be obliged to accompany my 
thanks with a severe scolding. Your friends tell me that they 
were specially instructed by you (in diplomatic phrase) not to 
allow me to reimburse you, through them, for the heavy expense 
which my commission has brought upon you. This is too bad, 
and makes me very restless. The only way in which you can 
soothe me is by telling me what article you want, or would 
covet, from England, as I shall have time to get it out before 
your friends return to Kentucky, after the session of Congress. 
If you will not make choice of something useful, I shall be 
obliged to send you some article which may prove very useless 
and very unacceptable. Exercise, therefore, your frankness, and 
pray put me in a way of executing a commission for you, in as 
acceptable a manner as you have just executed one for me. ^ I 
shall ever be proud of the rifle as a memorial of your friendship. 
I have not any public or private news to send you. I rejoice 
at the termination of the war in Turkey, and the opening of the 
commerce of the Black Sea has pleased all the world. As to 
politics at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, you will know better than I do what is 
the state of them. Congress has opened, it appears to me, in a 
perfect calm. 

I have been lately out of spirits, on account of the death of a 
brother, who was younger than myself, and who was a clergyman of exemplary life and character, and who has left behind 
him a widow and thirteen children. 

Mr. and Mrs. Johnston, Messrs. Letcher and Clark, and some 
others, your friends, are to dine with me on Chnstra^* ^y, 
when we shall drink your health. 

My kind regards to Mrs. Clay, and to Johnny. 
 


REV. JOHN S. BARGER TO MR. CLAY. 

Dear Sir, I could not conscientiously drink to you a toast, 
but I indulge the hope that you will permit me to offer to Almighty God an humble prayer for the Hon. Henry Clay. 

May God the Judge who " putteth down one and setteth up 
another" reward you with the confidence and highest honor of 
your happy country, for whose glory you have so arduously and 
faithfully toiled. May your labors for your country's glory be 
at least equaled by your competitor and surpassed by your efforts 
to secm-e your Maker's favor and to proclaim your Saviour's renown. And having faithfully served your country and your 
God, may you largely and forever share with his saints the honors and kingdom of om* common Saviour. Amen. 


REV. W3I. HAWLEY TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 14, 1830. 

My DEAR Sir, Permit me to return you my humble but sincere thanks for the very able, interesting, and I trust, useful 
speech in favor of the Colonization Society, which you have 
given to the public, a copy of which I received yesterday. 

I had read it the day before in the " National Intelligencer" with 
a pleasure and satisfaction I will not attempt to describe. Not a 
word is out of place, nor is there a sentence too much or too little. 
The whole subject is presented in so clear a light and happy arrangement that he who runs may read and understand the object, the 
importance and the usefulness of the institution. The appropriate 
manner iti which you have introduced the subject of Christianity 
and exhibited the powerful operation and extensive effects which 
would be produced by the successful accomplishment of the objects of the Society, in a religious point of view, will, I doubt 
not, command the united approbation of all denominations of 
Christians, and insure their cordial co-operation. 

Our anniversary takes place next Monday and I hope to succeed in having this speech placed on the pages of our Report ; 
for it ought to be in the hands of every man, woman and child, 
throughout the country. 

In your retirement from the honorable, but arduous situation, 
which you recently occupied, I hope your health has improved, 
and that the subject of religion, which you so eloquently advocate, and which my feeble endeavors to impress on your mind 
may have failed to accomplish to the extent of my wishes, will 
now occupy that portion of your time to which it has so powerful and just a claim both as it regards this world and that which is 
to come. In this world true religion sweetens all our joys, mitigates all our sorrows and eventuates in preparing us for the death 
of the righteous, and for those mansions of bliss prepared by the 
Saviour of the world for all those who truly love and obey 
him. 

You have my earnest prayer that your life may be long preserved to your family and to your country, and that you may 
yet receive her highest reward for the many useful services you 
have rendered the Republic, and finally obtain an unfading crown 
of glory at the right hand of God. 

Mrs. Hawley unites with me in affectionate regards to Mrs. 
Clay and yourself, and I beg you to accept the assurance of my 
very high esteem and respectful consideration. 



ALEXIS DE S.VE.CT TO MR. CLAY.* 

February 11, 1830. 

It will not be in my power to meet you so soon as I expected, 
but you may rest satisfied that all goes well. Be true to yourself, be discreet, and there is nothing to apprehend. Say nothing about Mr. Adams, nothing in allusion to him ; the reasons 
assigned in your speech, not long since, for accepting office under 
him, were injudicious. It will be impracticable for me to be in 
Kentucky earlier than May or June. 

* This note, and the following extract from a long letter of bold advice, are 
written over an assumed name, Alexis de Sarcy, but the writer appears- to have 
been well-known to Mr. Clay, and a sort of ilentor. How he was entertained in 
this capacity, is not known. See another note from same, page 241. 
 



ALEXIS DE SARCY TO SIR. CLAY. 

Sir, You are reputed to possess judgment, tact, a deep and 
correct knowledge of the human character, and a self-possession 
that never falters. I am not disposed to controvert the opinion, 
yet I think if you are to be judged by the events of the last five 
years, your claim to these qualities must be denied. Daring 
that period, you have committed errors so palpable and gross, 
that no man so distinguished could have been betrayed into. 
It might be ungracious, as well as unnecessary, to notice all the 
blunders of that time, but you will permit me to mention one, 
that remarkable one, your defense of yourself against the charge 
of '• bargain, intrigue, and management." Had you avowed a 
bargain, instead of denying, explaining, and defending, I am 
grossly mistaken in the character of the American people, if you 
had not sustained your popularity at its highest flow. If, instead 
of your letter to your constituents, and all your other letters and 
speeches and sayings, and the sayings of all your friends, ^ou 
had promptly declared that your vote for Mr. Adams was the 
result of a bargain, of a pledge on his part, to support the American system and internal improvements, while General Jackson's 
silence, reserve, and affectation of offended dignity at being approached, left you, the founder of the system, and all its other 
friends, in doubt as to the policy of his administration upon these 
subjects that this consideration, added to your other objections 
to the General, had decided your course upon that question, and 
that you accepted the Department of State under the influence 
of the same motives, to aid in extending and supporting the system, with a determination to resign and oppose the Administration, if Mr. Adams played false that it was the operation of 
such considerations which induced you to disregard the recommendation of the Kentucky Legislature, and offer yourself a 
victim on the altar of your country, as General Jackson had 
himself done in declaring martial law at New Orleans had you 
done this, my life on it, the newspaper clamor would have been 
hushed, that prolific theme been removed, and your adversaries 
confounded. It is over ! How shall we repair the loss and correct the evil ? 


MR. DURALDE* TO MR. CLAY. 

New Orleans, Marcli 18, 1830. 

My dear Sir, I received, by the return of William Claiborne, your letter of the 14th instant. I was glad to hear that 
Henry, so far, had been a good boy, and had given no trouble to 
those around him. I shall feel greatly relieved when I hear of 
your safe arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>. 

Your friends here feel grateful toward the people of Natchea
* Son-in-law to Mr. Clay. 

for having treated you so kindly during your short stay among 
them. 

The resoUitions concerning the Tariff, which passed the Senate unanimously, have also passed the House of Representatives 
by a large majority, there having been but seven dissenting 
votes. 

Unless a very great change should take place, I have no doubt 
but that A. B. Roman will be elected Governor of this State in 
July next. 

Mr. Thomas Hart, who is the bearer of this, will give you 
the pocket-handkerchief you had left at Donaldsonville. 

Present my best respects to Mrs. Clay, and to the rest of the 
family, and remember me to my dear, dear little Henry. 


WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON TO MR. CLAY. 

Steamboat Telegraph, near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=maysville" rel="city">Maysville</a>, April 11, 1830. 

Dear Sir, I w^ould have written to you immediately upon 
my arrival in the United States if I had not heard that you had 
gone on a visit to New Orleans, to inform 3^ou that I had forwarded your letter to General Bolivar, from Bogota, and that I 
had received a note from him acknowledging its reception and 
adding that there " was no answer." Herewith I send, a pamphlet which I have lately published, in which you will find a letter 
addressed by me to the same distinguished character, to which 
also he did not think proper to reply. I could have inserted 
many interesting circumstances which I omitted from the fear of 
injuring persons who still remain subject to the power of the 
Colombian Government. 

Accept for yourself and family my best respects. 

G. W. FEATHERSTONHAUGH TO MR. CLAY. 

PaiLADELrHiA, May 4, 1830. 

Mr DEAR Sir, The appearance of our friend, General Van 
Rensselaer here, within a few days, and some other incidents, 
have induced me to write you a few lines, before a contemplated 
voyage to Europe takes place. I was exceedingly pleased with 
the cheerful accounts General Van Rensselaer gave me of your 
health, spirits, and well-deserved popularity at the West and South. 
The value of my political attachment to you consists in its disinterestedness. Having no selfish views, I am not obliged to 
seek selfish connections. Independent of my ardent wishes for 
the prosperity of the whole human race, I have lived too long 
here, and been too nearly and dearly connected Avith the United 
States to see with indiflerence its best interests the sport of irresponsible men, who owe their distinction to the temporary delusion of popular favor, and who know not how to vindicate their 
claims to distinction, in the eyes of men of sense and honor. 
My intercourse with you has always been very frank. I may 
never see you again, though I hope I shall. Wherever I am, I 
shall be most happy to see the Government of this country in 
^our hands. I have been long satisfied you are the man America 
wants. ****** 


MR. VAUGHAN TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, May 13, 1830. 
My dear Sir, I have procured for you from England a 
single-barrel gun, and with a percussion-lock, after having consulted with our friend Letcher, who was of opinion that you 
would prefer it to the common lock. You will find in the case 
 

containing the gun a plentiful supply of percussion caps. In consequence of Judge Clark informing me that an opportunity offered of sending the gun to you, 1 sent it yesterday to his lodgings, and I trust that it is already on its way to Kentucky. I 
only hope that you will be as well satisfied with it as I am with 
the excellent rifle which you have presented to me, and which 
I am proud to have, as a memorial of your friendship. 

It is expected that this session of Congress will close on the 
31st instant, and I shall take the opportimity of sending to Mrs. 
Clay the lithograph print of a dog, executed by the son of 
Christopher Hughes, by our friend Mr. Clark or Mr. Letcher, 
and which has been due to her for so long a time. 

I am happy to infer from what I read in the newspapers about 
your movements, that your health is very much improved. It 
will give me great pleasure to meet you again, and, with kind 
regards to Mrs. Clay and Johnny, believe me, etc. 



MRS. ERWIN (aNNE B.) TO HER FATHER, MR. CLAY. 

Shelbyville, May 15, 1830. 

I HASTEN, my dear father, to answer your kind letter of the 
1st, and to assure you that mamma and yourself can not desire 
that we should be with you more than we both wish it. Mr. Erwin always spoke of our joining you early in the summer, 
but his father being compelled to go to Georgia in a few days, 
he now feels himself obliged to remain here until he returns. 
We shall, however, be with you the last of July or early in August, and I hope we shall not then be separated for a great while, 
as we shall be guided pretty much by your movements. 

I am happy to hear that you have been so good as to purchase us a pair of horses, as we are now without a good pair, 
intending to purchase when we should be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. As 
we shall not want them until then, you will please keep them 
for us. The pony you speak of has, I presume, been raised on 
the farm ; it will, therefore, be doubly prized by me. Mr. Erwin wrote you, I believe, that he had sold your horses. I enjoyed a great many good rides from them, as we had just then 
purchased a servant who proved to be an excellent carriagedriver, besides being a very good boy in other respects. 

Mr. Erwin and his friend, Mr. Denton, arrived on the 10th, 
four or five days earlier than I expected them. They were not 
so fortunate as I was in getting up all the way by water, but 
they were detained at the mouth of the Cumberland, and then 
had a most tedious trip by land to Nashville. 

I was a little surprised to see, by the last papers, uncle Porter Clay's maiTiage announced, although I presume it was a 
very suitable match, so far as age is concerned. 

My little children have grown very much since you sav/ them. 
Henry now talks quite plain, and James runs about every where, 
and begins to say a few words. He has fattened so much since 
we have been here that he is becoming quite a beauty, at least, 
for his opportunities, not having any to inherit from either side 
of the house. 

Father Erwin requested me to remember him affectionately 
to mamma and yourself. Mr. Erwin joins me in love to all the 
family both in town and at home. Believe me always, my dear 
father, your devoted daughter. 



PETER B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

Black Rock, May 23, 1830. 

Mt DEAR Sir, I have noticed, with great satisfaction, the accounts of the numerous demonstrations of confidence and respect shown to you by the people of the South, during your 
late tour ; and I feel equal pleasure in assuring you that the 
same sentiments that animate your Southern friends, are entertained, and I trust in a still higher degree, by the citizens generally in the Northern States ; and that these kind and partial 
feelings have been, and still are, constantly increasing, as oppor-tunity is afforded for comparing and contrasting the professions 
and acts of the present men in power, with those of their predecessors. 


BARON DE KRUDENER TO MR. CLAY. 

PniLADELPniA, August 16, 1830. 

SiRj I can not depart from this country without taking leave 
from you, and ofiering once more to you my thanks for the uncommon kindness which I experienced from you during the first 
part of my residence in this country, and through which, this 
stage of my diplomatic career, in America, was made so pleasant, 
so easy, and so honorable to me. The Emperor has granted me 
a permission to leave my post. I should certainly not have 
availed myself of it with so much eagerness had circumstances 
not interrupted the relations in which I had the honor of standing with you. At the time when these circumstances occurred, 
they were considered by me as a very untoward event. But 
these disagreeable views of the past have been changed into 
future prospects of such brightness, that it remains only for me 
to praise the divine Providence, and to admire its splendid interference in the affairs of your nation. 

Having notified my departure to Mr. Van Buren, and considerhig myself nov/ as a mere traveler and spectator, I feel no remorse in expressing to you my decided partiality, and my hope 

of seeing the Presidential chair, and the Federal Government, 
restored by you to their former dignity. You know, my dear 
sir, enough of my independence of mind to be convinced that 
this language is dictated by no other feelings than those of conviction and sincerity. 

Accept, sir, my best wishes for your personal and political 
prosperity, and the expression of my devotedness and great 
respect. 

I bea: to be remembered to our common friend, the excellent 
Mr. Letcher. 


PETER B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

Black Rock, October 6, 1S30. 

Dear Sib, This cursed anti-masonry embarrasses every 
thing, and defeats all attempts at systematic operation against 
the common enemy. Of one thing, however, I can assure you, 
which is, that you personally, as well as the leading measures 
of policy which you have so powerfully and conspicuously advocated, are visibly and rapidly gaining ground in every part of 
our State ; and [ am now much inclined to believe that, if we 
had, two months ago, started a candidate for Governor under 
the banner of Clay and the American system, we should have 
succeeded. 



MR. MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

Montpelier, October 9, 1830. 

Dear Sir, I have just been favored with yours of the 22d 
ultimo, inclosing a copy of your address delivered at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>. 
Without concurring in every thing that is said, I feel what is 
due to the ability and eloquence of the whole. The rescue of 
the Resolutions of Kentucky, in '98 and '99, from the misconstruction of them, was very apropos ; that authority being particularly relied on, as an asgis to the nullifying doctrine, which, 
notwithstanding its hideous aspect and fatal tendency, has captivated so many honest minds. In a late letter to one of my correspondents, I was led to the like task of vindicating the proceedings of Virginia in those years. I would gladly send you a 
copy if I had a suitable one. Bat as the letter is appended to 
the " North American Review" for this month, you will probably 
have an early opportunity of seeing it. 

With my thanks for your obliging communication, I beg you 
to accept assurances of my great and cordial esteem, in which 
Mrs. Madison joins me, as I do her in the best regards which 
she offers to Mrs Clay. 


NICHOLAS BIDDLE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, November 3, 1830. 

My dear Sir, I have purposely delayed answering your favor 
of the 11th of September, until I could speak with some degree 
of confidence as to the course which will be adopted in reference 
to the subject of it. In the mean time I have read repeatedly, 
and with renewed interest, all your remarks, proceeding, as I 
know they do, from one who, with ample materials of information and great sagacity in employing th^m, gives the result of 
his reflections with a sincere desire to serve the institution. For 
this, in any event, ^'"ou will accept my grateful thanks. 

After keeping the subject long under advisement, in order to 
observe the latest development of facts, I am now satisfied that 
it would be inexpedient to apply at present for the renewal of 
the Charter. My belief is, from all that I have seen, and read, 
and heard, that there is at this moment a majority of both Houses 
of Congress favorable to a renewal ; and, moreover, that the 
President would not reject the bill. The temptation is therefore 
great to take advantage of a propitious state of feeling like this. 
But* then the hazard is not to be disguised. A great mass of 
those who, if they were obliged to vote at all, would vote favorably, will prefer not voting if it can be avoided, and the dread 
of responsibility, the love of postponement, and the vis inertice 
inherent in all legislative bodies would combine to put off the 
question during the approaching short session. To pass both 
Houses and be rejected by the President to be rejected in either 
House, to be postponed in either House, to be brought forward 
in any shape, and not be finally and favorably acted upon, are 
degrees of evil but the mildest of them, a great evil, much to 
be deplored, and to be avoided, if possible. My impression, then, 
is, that nothing but a certainty of success should induce an application now. To this I am the more inclined, because time 
is operating in favor of the Bank by removing prejudices, and 
diffusing a general conviction of its utility. 

Having made up my own mind on the subject, I am gratified 
that this, which is the first expression I have made of this opinion, 
should be communicated to you, whose views have so largely 
influenced my own. It will always afford me great pleasure to 
receive the benefit of your further suggestions on this or any 
other subject, being with great respect and regard yours, etc. 


MR. CLAY TO 

New Orleans, February 16, 1831. 

Dear Sir, I found, on my arrival in this State, a general 
alarm pervading it in respect to the attack meditated on the 
Tariff, and which had been actually commenced in the House 
of Representatives. The people of Louisiana, an excellent race, 
and greatly attached to the Union, contemplate the success of 
that attack as involving their utter ruin. If, say they, we had 
remained a colony of France or Spain, our productions, and 
especially our great staple, would have been protected, in the 
parent country, against the rival productions of foreign colonies. 
And shall we, as an independent State, a member of this great 
Republic, fare worse than if we had continued a distant colony'? 

I must confess that they have made a convert of me, and have 
fully convinced me of two propositions : 1st. That the repeal or 
reduction of the present duty on foreign sugar would totally 
disable them from continuing the culture of the cane ; and 2d. 
That all parts of the Union would partake of the distress which 
would be certainly inflicted on them. 

Most erroneous impressions prevail, in other parts of the Union, 
as to the profits upon capital invested in sugar plantations. It 
happens to this business, as to all others, that now and then a 
planter, by the practice of the greatest economy, by a favorable 
season and the concurrence of fortunate circumstances, makes a 
large profit. These rare instances become the theme of general 
conversation, and hence it is rashly inferred that all the planters 
are growing rapidly rich. The conclusion is just as unwise as 
it would have been prior to the Tariff of 1824, to argue that the 
cotton manufacture was prosperous because that at Waltham was 

doing remarkably well. These cases of good fortune are neutralized by others of an opposite character. For example (and 
the instance is by no means singular), a planter, whose acquaintance I have formed, who is remarkable for his intelligence, and 
his accuracy and great attention to business, has, in partnership, 
an estate which cost upward of ^220,000. His partner, a 
skillful and diligent manager, resides on the estate. Minute and 
regular accounts are kept of their receipts and expenditures. 
They sold last year their crop, and, after deducting all expenses, 
the nett sum of f 800 remained to be divided between them ! 

But it is not on these extremes, on either side, that the statesman should be guided in adjusting his measures to the wants or 
necessities of a community. His conclusions should be drawn 
from the average profit deduced from a view of the entire branch 
of business, which his duties call upon him to consider. Proceeding upon this principle, I am persuaded, from all I have seen 
and heard here, that Mr. Senator Johnston, in his late excellent 
letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, in assuming as the average rate of profit upon capital employed in the culture of sugar 
cane, from five to six per cent, rather exceeds than falls short of 
the true standard. It is evident, then, that the Louisiana planter, 
if he were not protected by the existing duty, could not sustain 
a competition with the sugars of foreign colonies. They would 
compel him to abandon the business ; and the repeal of that duty 
would be almost as fatal to him as if Congress were to order the 
dykes to be razed from Point Coupee to the Balize. 

But if Congress, after having by its whole course of policy 
during a long series of years, inspired confidence in the inhabitants of this State as to the permanency of protection, and thereby 
invited them to invest their capital in their present pursuit, could 
overwhelm them in irretrievable ruin, their suff"erings would not 
be confined to themselves, but would extend to every other part 
of the Union. If manufactures in any country deserve protection because of the home market which they create for the productions of the industry of other classes, the sugar planter of 
Louisiana is equally entitled, for the same reason, to protection. 
The seven or eight hundred sugar plantations in Louisiana are, 
in fact, but seven or eight hundred great manufactories. The 
raw material is, it is true, produced on their plantations by the 
cultivation of the earth, but it is only produced to be there manufactured also into sugar and molasses. As consumers of the 
 

objects of the industry of other classes, the Louisiana planters are 
even more important than manufacturers exclusively employed 
in fabrication ; for they neither make their food, nor their clothing, nor their implements of labor, all of which they purchase 
from other States. Nay more, their very laborers themselves, in 
consequence of the institution of slavery, are chiefly brought from 
other States. Manufacturers, strictly so called, on the contrary, 
either make their own clothes, or their implements of labor, or 
both. 

I had no adequate conception, prior to my present visit to this 
State, of the extent of this dependence of the Louisiana planter 
upon ether States for his necessary supplies. He draws from 
them his flour, bacon, pork, beef, the greater part of the Indian 
corn fed upon his plantation, his carts, axes, spades, plows, hoes^ 
steam-engines for his sugar-house, stone-coal, boilers, horses, 
mules, cattle, the clothing of his slaves, whisky, and a great 
variety of small articles. These are obtained principally from 
Pennsylvania and the Western, Middle, and Northern States. 
His slaves, annually in great numbers, are brought from Virginia 
and Maryland. 

Let us suppose the market for these various articles to be suddenly cut off", the inevitable consequence of the repeal of the 
duty upon sugar, and am I not correct in saying that every part 
of the Union, in this view of the subject, would be deeply and 
sensibly afl'ected by the destruction of the business of the Louisiana planter ? Every article which I have enumerated would 
immediately fall in price, and no section of the Union would be 
altogether exempt from the consequences of a measure so disastrous. 

Would they be compensated by any permanent reduction in 
the price of sugar, the illusive object sought by those who, in 
aiming to repeal the duty, would lay the ax at the root of the 
prosperity of this interesting State ? It is confidently believed 
not. The present low price of sugar is attributable to the competition which has been produced between the West Indian 
and Louisiana planter. The eighty or one hundred thousand 
hogsheads which the latter annually throws into the general 
consumption have diminished to that extent, the demand for the 
produce of the former, who has been consequently compelled to 
reduce the price. This has obliged the Louisiana planter also to 
reduce the price, and he has found himself sustained only by the 

possession of the home market, the principal part of which is 
given him by the existing duty. If that duty were repealed, and 
if Louisiana continued permanently to produce the quantity which 
she now annually yields, undoubtedly there would be a permanent reduction of price. But the effect of a repeal of the duty 
would compel the Louisiana plai^ter to abandon cultivation of 
the sugarcane. Absolute ruin would attend him if he continued 
to prosecute it. Then what would happen ? The eighty or 
one hundred thousand hogsheads now contributed by Louisiana 
would be withdrawn from the general consumption. A demand 
would ensue for eighty or one hundred thousand hogsheads more 
of the production of the West Indies. This demand would 
speedily augment the price, and the probability is, that it would 
rise to what it now is, or nearly so. It may be argued that 
when, after falling, the price should again rise to the present 
rate, the Louisiana planter would resume the cultivation. But 
this admits of several satisfactory answers. In the first place, if 
he was now out of the business, he probably would not embark 
in it, such are the discouragements produced by low prices and 
the dread of a change of public policy. He continues the business because he is in it, has built his houses, made his canals 
and ditches, established his manufactory, consisting of m.ills, 
steam-engines and boilers, and effected all his other arrangements 
with a view to his present pursuit. Supposing that abandoned ; 
supposing all these arrangements overturned, and his plantation 
appropriated to the cultivation of cotton, rice, or any other article, it would not be so easy, under the temptation even of a 
high price of sugar, to return to the planting of cane. The 
establishment of a sugar plantation, with all its manufacturing 
and other apparatus, is not suddenly accomplished, but is a work 
of long, patient, and arduous industry. Finally, he could not 
fail to reflect that the encouraging price of sugar, for the moment, 
resulted from the absence of Louisiana competition, and that, 
whenever this returned, a depressed and ruinous stale of the 
market would be inevitable. 

Other views of this interesting question might be taken, but I 
will content myself with noticing only an additional one.- If the 
cultivation of the sugar cane be abandoned, the labor now employed in it must be directed to some other object ; and that 
object undoubtedly would be cotton. But this article is already 
produced in excessive quantity. Would it be wise in Congress, 
 

by curtailing the pursuits of the people of the United States, to 
compel a large portion of their industry to seek employment in a 
business already overdone ? The effect would be most injuriously 
felt in Tennessee, the northern parts of Alabama and Mississippi, 
the upper parts of Georgia and South Carolina, and generally 
those districts of the cotton region which are the least adapted to 
the production of that staple. 

I found the sensibility of the people of this State, on my arrival here, greatly excited on another subject. Shortly after the 
cession of Louisiana, an act of Congress required all the inhabitants to register their titles to lands granted to them by the previous governments, and denounced, as a penalty for a neglect to 
comply with this law, that the proprietors should not be allowed 
to use their unregistered titles in any court of justice. The object at which Congress aimed was a proper and legitimate object, 
it being to discriminate between the public domain and private 
property ; but it may now be well doubted whether the means 
were not rigorously and disproportionately severe. Many, from 
no disrespect whatever to the Legislature, but from a perfect confidence in the security of their titles, resulting from ancient possession and complete grants, and strengthened by a positive stipulation in the treaty of cession guaranteeing their property, 
omitted to register theii- titles. Many, from ignorance of the 
law, promulgated in a language not their own, also omitted to 
register their titles. An opinion has prevailed among the bar, 
that in the case of perfect titles, the ceremony of registry was 
unnecessary. 

Notwithstanding this state of conscious security, the lands of 
many of the ancient proprietors, who never dreamed of danger, 
have been thrown into the market. Sales have been actually 
made, in several instances, of plantations which have been in 
cultivation from fifty to one hundred years ; and the first knowledge of them which the unfortunate planters acquired v/as a notice from the speculator, not to remove, at their peril, any thing 
whatever from the plantation. A church even, long dedicated to 
public worship, has been actually sold ! The interposition of 
the Executive has, I understand, been in vain invoked. I do 
hope that that of Congress, to which the Legislature has appealed, 
will be afibrded, and that some efiicacious remedy will be provided. 

What that remedy should be, Congress is most competent to 

decide. The effect of the introduction to the proprietor of the 
use, in courts of justice, of his title paper, is a forfeiture of his 
land. But is not that punishment altogether too severe, and disproportionate to the offense, if offense it can be called, of nonregistry? Especially when that was never contumacious, and 
in most, if not all, instances proceeded from ignorance of law or 
language, or forgetfulness. It seems to me that some mode 
might have been adopted to discriminate between the public and private lands other than that of obliging the inhabitants 
to register their titles, already recorded in the archives of preceding governments, under the pains and penalties of forfeiture ot 
their estates. Had they committed the crime of high treason, 
under ancient law, the punishment, as to their estates, would not 
have been greater ; but even the crime of high treason, in the 
mitigated spirit of modern institutions, does not draw after it a 
forfeiture of the culprit's estate. It may indeed be well questioned whether the act of Congress is not repugnant to that 
amendment of the Federal Constitution, which forbids a man's 
property to be taken from him without due process of law. 

I do not know the extent of the evil which I have depicted. 
I have understood that perhaps one third of the plantations from 
Point Coupee down the Mississippi are in that condition. This, 
you know, comprises the best and longest settled, as well as the 
richest part of the State. And what aggravates the misfortune 
is, that the omission to register has been chiefly on the part of 
the Creole planters, affording a strong presumption that it has 
proceeded from ignorance of the American laws and language, 
the American planters having most generally taken the precaution to comply with the law. 

Thus threatened with the loss both of their lands and their 
produce, it is astonishing how patiently this good people bear up 
under their afflictions. Complaints there are among individuals, 
but neither the Legislature nor any public assembly has, for a moment, forgot its loyalty to the Union, or its respect to the public 
authorities. We have no menaces of violence, no charges of 
the oppression and tyranny of the majority, no threats to execute 
the powers of nullification. They appear to abide in perfect 
confidence that, when their condition is fully understood, in the 
general family council, right and justice will be done them. 
That they may not be disappointed I sincerely pray. 
 


GENERAL BERNARD TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> City, July 19, 1831. 

Sir, I have the honor to inform you that it is with deep regret I am about to leave this hospitable land, and to return to 
Europe, whose political situation places me under the moral obligation to tender once more my humble services to France. 

Before leaving this abode of liberty and peace, permit me to 
express to you, one of the great citizens of this noble Republic, 
how my heart is full of gratitude for the honorable and generous 
patronage ^ou have bestowed upon me during the fifteen years 
that I have served this great people. 

While I shall always remember with pride your kind regard 
toward me, my family will never forget how much we are indebted to Mrs. Clay for her polite attentions toward us during her 
stay at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 

Be so indulgent, sir, as to receive my most fervent wishes for 
yom* happiness, and the expression of my everlasting sentiments 
of gratitude. 


GENERAL DEARBORN TO MR. CLAY. 

Beinley Place, Roseuey, September 3, 1831. 

Much respected Sir, From conversations with a number 
of your most influential friends in this State, I am induced to 
urge upon you the expediency of your going into the Senate 
of the United States. The next session will be of a veiy interesting and momentous character, and your talents, independence, 
and influence extremely desirable. Your presence will be a host. 
Not only the great interests of the country require your services, 
but your fellow-citizens, who claim you as their candidate, can 
not be so well subserved, as by your being in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. We 
hope that no motives of delicacy will restrain you. The times 
are portentous, and there is no man in the land who can do so 
much to restore confidence in the stability of the Republic. 
 

There will be many <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>s in the field, and each endeavoring to angment his forces by all means within his power. 
We want an abler and better man than any of them, to defeat 
their ambitious schemes of aggrandizement, and it is indispensable that you should be at the post of conflict. 

I trust in your magnanimity to excuse this freedom, but I am 
but expressing the opinion of your best friends here. 



MR. ADAMS TO MR. CLAY. 

QuiNCY, September '7, 1831. 

My dear Sir, A very few days after transmitting to you a 
copy of an oration composed at the request of my neighbors at 
this place, I had the pleasure of receiving your friendly letter 
of the 26th July, which I have delayed answering till I could 
have the opportunity of forwarding with my answer a copy of 
another discourse prepared by invitation of the City Council of 
Boston in honor of our deceased friend and ex-President, Monroe. 

I have availed myself of both these occasions to lay before 
our countrymen throughout the Union, the opinions which T 
have constantly entertained upon the doctrine of Nullification, 
and you will have seen that among the States which I have 
charged with directly asserting, or imprudently giving countenance to it, is your beloved State of Kentucky, as well as my 
own Massachusetts. I believe we are even indebted to Kentucky for the word, my remark upon which you will perhaps 
think savors of hypercriticism. A letter from Mr. Madison to 
Edward Everett, published last autumn in the " North American 
Review," disclaims explicitly all intention of resorting to force, 
l)y the interposition of the State Legislatures to arrest the operation of acts of Congress, deemed by such State Legislatures unconstitutional. Holding, as I do, that in our country all the 
powers of Government that can lawfully be exercised emanate 
from the people, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that 
neither the General Government, nor the State Governments can 
lawfully interfere with the appropriate functions of each other, 
nor exercise any authority or power not delegated to them by 
the people. The State is the creation of the people. Each of 
the thirteen original States passed by the will of its people, from 
the condition of a subject dependent colony, to that of an independent State, united with twelve others, and this operation was effected, not by the separate action of each colony, but by the 
joint operation of the people of the whole ; and the Congress 
of 1776, assuming to speak in their name, and by their authority, 
fully sanctioned by their acquiescence, proclaimed this Union to 
the world in the Declaration of Independence. 

The State then is the body corporate formed by the association of the people. The Constitution is the organic law or 
commission of Government. It is the delegation of power to be 
exercised by the public functionaries for the common good. 
Those functionaries can not lawfully travel out of the record in 
the exercise of power. Despotic or autocratic power is not only 
foreign to our institutions, but is expressly interdicted by the 
Declaration of Independence. 

I assumed then that the people of no one State in the Union 
have ever delegated to their Government the right to interpose 
by legislation, to obstruct the operation of any act of Congress. 
That a State legislature may, as an assembly of individuals, remonstrate or petition I do not deny, and this was the only plausible ground upon which the Hartford Convention attempted to 
legahze their convocation and proceedings. 

The Government of the Union, is, and necessarily must be, 
the judge of the extent of its own powers. So is the Government of each State. This is an essential attribute not only of 
sovereign but of independent power, and this is after all the refuge to which the school of despotic sovereignty must fly when 
pursued by the absm-dities of their own argument. The Government of the Union, and the Governments of the States, are 
in their lawful action each independent of the other. But the 
Constitution of the United States expressely prohibits the States 
from the exercise of certain powers high and transcendent powers and this prohibition and its lawfulness is expressly recognized in the tenth emendatory article. Prohibits ! who prohibits ? If the States were the parties to the compact what right 
would either or all of them have to prohibit the exercise of any 
power by any one of them. They might stipulate the nonexercise of any given power ; but to prohibit is the action of authority upon obedience the relation of law to submission. The 
prohibiting power of the Constitution is We the People of the 
United States, That "poor little thing" as Patrick Henry called 
it, " the expression, We the People, instead of the States of America," If, therefore, any one State, whether by an act of the 
Legislature or by a convention of its people, authorizes resistance 
or obstruction to the execution of any act of Congress, it exercises 
a power out of the pale of the Union ; nullifies its own portion 
of the Constitution of the United States, violates the Declaration 
of Independence, and levies war against the United States. 

This is and ever has been my opinion. Now the Virginia and 
Kentucky resolutions of 1798 and 1799 ; the opinion of Judge 
M'Kean and the Olmsted case in Pennsylvania ; the Hartford 
Convention, and the proceedings of the Legislature of Massachusetts and Connecticut authorizing that assembly ; the opinions 
of the Judges Parsons, Sewell, and Parker, of the Supreme Court 
of Massachusetts, given to the Legislature of the State ; Spencer Roane's project of a bill in the " <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Enquirer," and the 
doctrines of Calhoun and his squad at this day, all assert or countenance a right of interposition by the States, against acts of 
Congress, which I find nowhere delegated to the States. Mr. 
Madison disclaims for the Virginia Resolutions all purpose of 
coimteracting legislation ; his southern disciples appeal from the 
commentary to the text, and Hamilton, the nullifier, charges him 
with desertion of his own principles. 

The doctrine, in all its parts, is so adverse to my convictions 
that I can view it in no other light than organized civil war. 
That it has the sanction of high and venerable names makes it 
but the more portentous of evil to the Union. Mr. Calhoun is 
but a pupil of the Hartford Convention, though he takes special 
care not to include them in his citation of authorities. Parsons 
and Roane, and M'Kean, and Jefferson have all been nullifiers 
when in a passion. Mr. Madison alone has explained, when 
cool, what he said when warm, and it extracts from the doctrine 
its venom if not its sting. 

The doctrine has never yet been carried into effect. In the 
Olmsted case the issue was made, but nullification, after lighting 
the match, flinched from her quarters. It is the odious nature 
of the question that it can be settled only at the cannon's mouth. 
The South Carolina nuUifiers appear determined to come to that 
point, and I hear our sober friend Langdon Cheves has made up 
his mind that the Union must be dissolved for incompatability 
of interests between North and South. What shall we do with 
these heroes ? 

The papers in the " United States Gazette" upon the colonial 
trade arrangement, were written by Edward Ingersoll. 

Mrs. Adams unites with me in offering our respectful regards 
to Mrs. Clay. We hope her health is entirely restored, and rejoice at the good account we have of yours, particularly from 
Mr. George Eustis, who lately saw you. 


TIMOTHY PICKERING TO MR. CLAY. 

Boston, October 22, 1831. 

Dear Sir, Will you permit an ardent political friend to address you upon a subject of the highest importance. 

You are already aware that the Hon. William Wirt has been 
nominated by a very respectable Convention at Baltimore, for 
the high ofiice of President of the United States. 

You are aware that at the election of J. Q.. Adams, you were 
accused of bargain and corruption. You may be aware, also, 
that no respectable man of good information does now believe it. 

You recollect that you stated your conviction of General 
Jackson's inability, and notorious incompetency to fill that high 
station, and put your character and motives upon the issue. 

You are aware that the present organization renders your election impossible. 

You are aware that the sentiments of Mr. Wirt, upon the 
great and important points of our domestic policy are in unison 
with your own. 

Now, sir, since your own election is impossible, would it not 
be the greatest blessing which you could possibly confer upon 
your country, to retire from the contest, and let all your forces 
be brought over to Mr. Wirt's side, and thus, by securing his 
election, you would be the means of delivering the country from 
the domination of the present weak and imbecile Administration. 

Please to accept these remarks from a constant political friend. 


MRS. ERWIN TO HER FATHER, MR. CLAY. 

New Orleans, December 8, 1831. 

My dear Father, I wrote mamma last from Cahaba. Not 
being certain whether she would go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> or not, I addressed my letter to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, so that you will probably receive 
this one before that. We went on board of the boat a few hom-s 
after I wrote, and had a very pleasant passage of two days to 
Mobile, where we remained a week with our friends. We left 
there on the 4th, expecting to be here in twenty-four hours, but, 
owing to the steamboat being badly managed, we were two days 
and three nights in coming. We had a most comfortless time, 
and on arriving here found our friends very anxious about us, as 
there was a report that we were lost. I was delighted at finding 
Henry here. He has not been very well for a day or two past, 
but is in good spirits and appears to be very much pleased with 
the prospect of settling here. All of our friends have been very 
kind and attentive to him. Old Mr. Henderson gave him a dinner 
at which he invited some of the oldest gentlemen in the city to 
meet him. This was intended, of course, as a great compliment 
to his understanding. We found our rooms, that Mr. Erwin had 
engaged last spring, ready for us, and I think we shall be quite 
pleasantly situated. I am as yet the only lady in the house, but 
as we have a private table I shall prefer it, as I must necessarily 
be a greater belle, there being no competition in the case ; and 
you know, my dear father, too well for me to disguise the fact, 
that all ladies like the attention of gentlemen. I have not 
as yet had time to see any of my friends except Aunt Clay. The 
weather for the last two weeks has been detestable. Judge 
Porter called this morning to see us. He appears to be in good 
health, but is of course very dejected. His daughter will remain 
in the city this winter with Mrs. Judge Matthews, and will spend 
next summer with me in Kentucky. 

******* 

I hope, my dear father, you will not be so entirely absorbed 
in politics but that you will find time to write us frequently. 
Present me affectionately to all those persons who remember me 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and give Mr. Erwin's love as well as mine to 
mamma. 
 


HORTON HOWARD TO MR. CLAY. 

CoLCMBus, December 19, 1831. 

Esteemed Friend, I had but one objection to thy going to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> at present, and the good that I hoped would result 
from it overcame that objection. 1 nevertheless feel it my duty, 
as one of thy real friends, to caution thee to be at all times on 
thy guard. I have no doubt that attempts will be made, in 
many ways, to get thee out of the way. 

Now, so long as thou bears in mind that thou art accountable 
to thy Creator for the talents he has committed to thee for the 
promotion of his glory, and that while on earth it must be promoted by rendering benefits to his creature man, so long his protecting Providence will preserve thee from harm. So long as 

21 

the knowledge thou possesses that this nation claims thee as its 
property, and has a right to thy services in this eventful period, 
continues to be duly estimated, so long, I conceive, thou wilt so 
far disregard the machinations of the wicked as to contemn the 
foolish laws of honor, as they are falsely called. They have already been an injury to thee. Thy country knows thou possesses courage enough of this kind, as well as of a much higher 
and dignified kind. If insults or challenges should be again offered, it now expects thee to give the most unequivocal evidence 
that thou also possesses courage of a vastly more exalted and diglified character, and of course that with the stern independence 
and elevation of mind which has marked or distinguished thy 
political course, thou wilt with fearless intrepidity discountenance 
such false pretenses to honor, both by example and precept. 

I do not fear its giving offense, and make no apology for this 
freedom of communication. 


MRS. ERWIN* TO HER FATHER, MR. CLAY. 

New Orleans, January "7, 1832. 

My dear Father, I to-day received your favor of the 25th 
of December, and read it with more than ordinary pleasure as 
we had not heard a word from you since your arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, although we had been tantalized with a sight of your 
handwriting, as you had inclosed the Message both to MR.Erwin and Henry. You have no doubt heard before this, that 
Claiborne has declined returning this winter ; it is owing to his 
health, which is much better than it was when he left here ; but 
he writes that his eyes are still so much affected that he thinks 
it prudent for him to remain at least another year. They have 
elected Mi. Dixon to fill his place ; he is a warm partisan of 
yours, and was elected by one vote over Mr. Marigny, but the 
opposite party speak of contesting the election. It is not supposed, however, that they will succeed in turning Mr. Dixon 
out. So much for politics. You see it is impossible to be the 
daughter of a politician without, at least, knowing what is 
going on. 

We have been suffering here with the same influenza which 
appears to be prevailing at the North. The Creoles have felt it 
more than the Americans. Indeed in some cases where the individuals were old, it has proved fatal. Mrs. Clay has been severely attacked. She was confined to her bed for several days, 
and has not left the house for more than two weeks. I am glad 
to be able to say that she is much better now. Mr. Dnralde 
also has been quite sick with it ; but I believe he is well enough 
now to go down to his saw-mill. 

Henry has commenced the study of law under Judge Porter's 

* Mrs. Erwin was a favorite cbild, and obtained the stronjjest lioid on her 
father's heart. Mr. Erwin had a country seat at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, adjoining Asliland, 
called the " Woodlands," a beautiful place, where the family resided in sumtuer. 

I . . 

directions. He complains a little of the large folios he sends 
him, and thinks the Judge does not estimate his talents quite 
high enough when he supposes it will require two years of hard 
study to prepare him to commence the practice. The Judge's 
family appears to be completely broken up since the death of 
Miss Eliza. He has taken lodgings in town, and his daughter 
is passing the winter with Mrs. Mathews. I have invited her to 
spend the ensuing summer with me, and her father has promised 
that she should accompany us on our return to Kentucky. We 
have not heard a word from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> since the 29th of November. The river being frozen up, there is no communication at 
all between this and the Western country. The last letter I 
received was from James. I was very much gratified to find 
that he writes an uncommonly good letter for so young a boy. 

I have been so fortunate as to find an infant-school established 
here upon the same plan as those at the North, where I send the 
boys. They did not like to go much at first, but by giving them 
a few sugar-plums every day I hired them for the first week, 
and they are now becoming interested in it. It is a very great 
relief to me to know that they are doing well and are out of 
mischief from nine until three every day. Little Lucretia grows 
every day. She is the most mischievous child of her age I ever 
saw. Aunt Lotty and she have at least a dozen quarrels a day. 
I can not thank my dear mother enough, for having spared 
Lotty to me. She is the best creature I ever saw, and appears 
to be quite as much attached to the children, as she ever was to 
yours. 

Tell mamma I shall certainly execute her commission with a 
great deal of pleasure, and if she can think of any thing else 
she wishes, you will have quite time to let me know, as we 
we shall not leave this before the 1st of March. I have begun 
to make her the collection of baskets she wished me to get for 
her. The children all send a kiss to their dear grandparents, as 
well as their love to Henry Duralde. Mr. Erwin joins me in 
love both to mamma and yourself. If Uncle Brown is with 
you, you will remember us both affectionately to him. You 
will please say to him that Mr. Erwin will be happy- to render 
him any service in this country in his power. 
 

JOSEPH HOWARD TO MR. CLAY. 

Tiffin, Ohio, January 27, 1832. 
Much esteemed Friend, ^Permit me to herewith inclose to 
thy acceptance the last Annual Report of our Canal Commissioners, by which it will be seen that one more link will shortly be 
completed in the great chain which, I hope, when completed, 
will add greatly to the strength and perpetuity of our Union. 
As it is at all times a source of gratitude to the parent to see his 
children as they advance in years advance toward perfection, so 
it must be a source of great satisfaction to the great parent and 
author of a system which but a few years ago existed only in 
theory, now to see it rapidly advancing toward the highest state 
of perfection that was anticipated by its author. Under this 
view of the subject it is then that I take the liberty of presenting the inclosed document to the universally-acknowledged 
author of a system which has, either directly or indirectly, contributed greatly to the projection and consummation of this stupendous work ; a system wbich, if cherished, will be a rich legacy 
for future generations. 



LESLIE COMBS TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, January 27, 1832. 

My dear Sir, ^You have made a very sensible speech on 
your proposition to take off certain duties and reduce others. 
You occupied the true ground on every point you made, and did 
it with becoming temper. I regret that the Southrons are crazy, 
but let them fret ; you must not quarrel with them. You occupy higher ground than any of them, and must look down upon 
them and sooth them, not yourself play the gladiator. That 
would do for me, if I were in Congress ; as I am not, others must 
do it. Your course must be above all partisan warfare, and God 
will speed you. It must be for the Union, the whole Union, and 
nothing but the Union. 

I am daily laboring to raise the caloric in our friends on this 
side the mountains. They are too cold, and selfish, and lethargic for me, but I never give up a good cause while there is a 
man in the field or a shot in the locker. 



PATRICK HENRY TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, February 18, 1832. 

Sir, I have not yet had the honor of a personal acquaintance 
with you, but as we claim Virginia as our nativity (where I 
live and expect to die), and as my admiration for your character 
and principles admits of no comparison with the most distinguished living, I feel at liberty to make a suggestion, and, 
if it should meet with your views of liberal policy, for which 
you have been so much distinguished, I shall be very much 
gratified. It is that Henry Clay should forthwith introduce a 
resolution for the purchase of Mount Yernon ; the improved 
grounds including the park, extending to the gate leading to 
Alexandria, with any other addition of land to the north and 
south of the mansion as may be thought desirable by Congress. 
If it should be the pleasure of Congress to make the purchase, 
the country would not only be in possession of the remains of 
the Father of the Republic, but would be enabled to preserve 
and use the property for some national purpose. It would be advisable (should this project meet with your approbation) first to 
ascertain through your friend, G. C. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, whether the 
proprietor of Mount Yernon would be willing to sell the property 
to the United States. Wishing you all the honors that can be 
conferred by your country, I am, sir, your most obedient servant. 


JAMES BARBOUR TO MR. CLAY. 

Bareouksville, March 7, 1832. 

Dear Sir, You have obliged me much by furnishing me 
with your speech on the Tariff. It is the strongest view I have 
ever seen on the subject. If the facts are true to which you refer as the basis of your argument, your argument is unanswerable. I duly appreciate the necessity which induced you to introduce some remarks merely ad captandum. Contending as 
you are with an enemy using poisoned weapons, the right of defense extends to the employment of what otherwise might not 
be considered very legitimate means. 

Your positions are judicious, and you have ably defended 
them. Great perspicuity is your leading characteristic. 



HARRISON GREY OTIS TO MR. CLAY. 

Boston, March 8, 1832. 

Dear Sir, I had read your admirable speech with great delight, and pondered its contents, before I received the copy 
which you did me the honor to transmit. This, however, was 
not the less acceptable, as, in addition to the value of the attention, it gives me a right and an excuse for making my personal 
acknowledgment, without claiming or expecting a reply ; knowing by long experience that no class of men are more in need of 
" protecting duties" from the uninvited consignments of correspondents, who expect remittances which interfere with time 
and convenience, than the members of Congress. And though 
the voice of one individual contributes little to swell the note of 
acclamation which you hear from all quarters, yet mine is entitled to something of more value than that of anybody, inasmuch 
as the only lance I ever broke with you was in defense of hemp 
and molasses, when you came forth as the champion of Mr. 
Baldwin's bill, which I dare say you have forgotten. But teni'pora mutantur, and I am among those who have been coerced 
by the policy of government mutari cum illis. Among the excellencies of your speech, that in my mind predominates which 
calls the agricultural, and especially the mechanical class, to look 
to the case as their own. 
 



MR. MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

MoNTPELiER, March 13, 1832. 

J. Madison, with his best respects to Mr. Clay, thanks him for 
the copy of his speech ''In defense of the American System," 
etc. It is a very able, a very eloquent, and a very interesting 
one. If it does not establish all its positions, in all their extent, 
it demolishes not a few of those relied on by the opponents. J. 
M. feels a pleasure in offering this tribute to its merits. Bat he 
must be pardoned for expressing a regret that an effusion of personal feeling was, in one instance, admitted into the discussion. 


MR. MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

MoNTPELiER, March 22, 1832. 

Dear Sir, I have duly received yours of the 17th. Although 
you kindly release me from a reply, it may be proper to say, that 

some of the circumstances to which you refer were not before 
known to me. 

On the great question before Congress, on which so much depends out of Congress, I ought the less to obtrude an opinion, as 
its merits essentially depend on details which I never investigated, and of which I am an incompetent judge. I knov/ only 
that the Tariff, in its present amount and form, is a source of 
deep and extensive discontent ; and I fear that, without alleviations, separating the more moderate from the more violent opponents, very serious effects are threatened. Of these, the most 
formidable, and not the least probable, would be a Southern Convention, the avowed object of some, and the unavowed object 
of others whose views are, perhaps, still more to be dreaded. 
The disastrous consequences of disunion, obvious to all, would ' 
no doubt be a powerful check on its partisans ; but such a convention, characterized as it would be by selected talents, ardent 
zeal, and the confidence of those represented, would not be easily 
stopped in their course ; especially, as many of the m.embers, 
though not carrying with them particular aspirations for the honors, etc., presented to ambition on a new political theater, would 
find them germinating in such a hot-bed. 

To these painful ideas I can only oppose hopes and wishes, 
that notwithstanding the wide space and warm feelings which 
divide the parties, some accommodating arrangements may be 
devised that will prove an immediate anodyne, and involve a 
lasting remedy to the Tariff discords. 

Mrs. Madison charges me with her affectionate remembrances 
to Mrs. Clay, to whom I beg to be at the same time respectfully 
presented, with a re-assurance to yourself of my high esteem and 
cordial regards. 



R. S. BROWNING TO MR. CLAY. 

Rome, April 6, 183 SJ. 
Sir, In visiting the relics of ancient Rome, my attcp.tka 
was naturally called to the tomb of Cicero. It stands on the 
spot where that immortal orator was assassinated by some base 
creatures of Mark Antony, near his villa, at Mola. I could not 
contemplate the monument, whose solidity had defied the ravages of nearly two thousand years, or tread the consecrated sod, 
without feelings of excitement. His unrivaled eloquence, that 
was ever raised for the rights of man his fearless defense of 
the Roman Republic his eminence as a lawyer the ability 
with which he presided over the Roman people all hurried 
upon my memory in rapid succession. Nor did I forget that the 
enemies of Cicero were numerous. But they were the enemies 
of the Republic, and sought to destroy Roman liberty by blasting the character of its most able defender. But Cicero was 
virtuous, and the Roman people were not yet dazzled by the 
success of a military chieftain, and rewarded his virtue by their 
highest gift. How could these reflections cross my mind without recalling you to my recollection ? Your eloquence in defense of our Republic has been heard from the Mississippi to the 
Rhine. Your legal knowledge and abilities as a statesman, 
that give you the first rank in " the land of liberty," like Cicero's, 
have ever been directed to the good of the people. And you, 
too, have your enemies. May wisdom and virtue weaken their 
strength. May the Republicans of the United States prove to 
the world that they are not deluded by the success of a military 
chieftain, by rewarding your virtue and talents with the first 
gift of the nation. May they show themselves superior to the 
Romans by never deserting the cause of liberty, and by confiding 
only in wise and virtuous lovers of liberty. 

With these reflections, I cut a bough of an abavita, that shaded 
the tomb, and have had a cane made of it, which I forward you 
by the bearer of this note, and beg your acceptance of it. 
 


FBANCIS BEOOKE to MR. CLAY. 

St. Julien, April 23, 1832. 
My DEAR Sib, ^I was deeply affected by our last conversation 
on the subject of your health, and I conjure you to take care of 
it. I have some experience, and no little information from 
books, of the effect of diet, etc., upon the animal economy, and 
I am aware of the truth of the vulgar maxim, that " what is 
one man's meat, is another's poison," and therefore will not pre
tend to prescribe any specific course to you. It is perfectly true 
that if you will not permit your inclinations to control your 
judgment, you will better decide than the most experienced of 
the faculty, what diet is most conducive to your health ; but 
there are some general principles that we can not be mistaken 
in, and one is, that after high excitement from any cause, there 
is invariably a consquent debility, Vvdiich will always increase materially any predisposition to torpor, and even paralysis. High 
excitement, then, from any cause, ought to be avoided, and especially from causes that always precede great debility. I think 
I can not warn you too strongly, against the excessive use of 
tobacco, in any form. As Milo learned to cany the ox by carrying the calf every day, the quantity of tobacco may be diminished from day to day. This also may be said of wine ; but 
there is another cause of high excitement which is more pernicious, and more difficult in your situation to be avoided, that 
which results from dwelling too much on the deplorable condition of our public affairs, and on the relation in which you are 
placed in regard to them. It is the more difficult for you to look 
on them in the calm lights of a mild philosophy, but yet you 
ought to be satisfied with performing your duty, and to leave 
the rest to others, and to that Providence which has heretofore 
watched over us. It is in vain to attempt to do more, and I 
shall be truly rejoiced when I find you less anxious, and, of 
course, less excited. There are times, when, as v/e have seen 
in history, patriotism made things that w"ere bad, worse. I trust 
that we are not yet in that condition, but if that virtue is worth 
any thing, you ought to take care of your health ; it is of great 
importance that you should. I hope I shall have a letter from 
you, giving me a better account of it than when you were here. 


AMBROSE SPENCER TO MR. CLAY. 

Near Albany, April 28, 1832. 

Dear Sir, I thank you for the copy of your report on the 
public lands, which you kindly sent me, and I avail myself of 
the occasion to trouble you with a letter. I have considered myself unfortunate in never having had the pleasure of seeing you, 
or corresponding with you. When you were in power I had no 
favor to ask, although as far as my influence extended it was in 
favor of the last Administration. I admit that there were some 
passages in your public life which I disapproved ; but I am ha}> 
py also to be able to say that explanations given to me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> by honorable men, removed impressions of an unfavorable nature. The report you have sent me, and the general tenor 
of your public life, have indelibly impressed me that you are 
actuated, as a public man, by the purest principles and the sternest integrity. 

You may think it strange that I should open a correspondence 
in this manner, but I consider it proper and necessary you should 
be informed by me of the undisguised state of my past and 
present feelings toward you. * * * * 

Being myself thoroughly convinced that we are doomed to 
national degradation, and to the rain of all our most valuable institutions, if General Jackson is re-elected, I will endeavor to do 
my duty in averting these calamities. 
 



CHIEF JUSTICE MAESHAIiL TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, May 7, 1832. 

Dear Sir, On my return to this place, from a visit to my 
friends in our upper country, I had the pleasure of receiving 
your report on the public lands, which I have read with attention. The subject is of immense interest, and has long produced 
and is still producing great excitement. 

My sentiments concur entirely with those contained in the report, which are so clearly and so well expressed that it must, I 
think, be approved by a great majority of Congress. Unanimity 
is not to be expected in any thing. 

I thank you for this mark of attention, and am with great and 
respectful esteem your obedient servant. 


A DAUGHTER OF MASSACHUSETTS TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, July 4, 1832. 

Sir, I beg leave, through this medium, to offer you my sincere acknowledgment for your recent noble and spirited avowal 
of your belief of the Christian religion, and of your reverence for 
its precepts ; and I can assure you, sir, that a large majority of 
the daughters of the descendants of the Pilgrims unite with me 
in the same sentiment. 

Our prayers will be offered to Almighty God, and our influence exerted with our friends, for your elevation to that office 
which is the first in the gift of the people of this Union ; and 
should our prayers be answered, may you prove " a terror to evil 
doers, and a praise to those who do well." 
 

NICHOLAS RIDDLE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, August 1, 1832. 
My dear Sir, You ask what is the effect of the veto ? My 
impression is, that it is working as well as the friends of the 
Bank and of the country could desire. I have always deplored 
making the Bank a party question, but since the President will 
have it so, he must pay the penalty of his own rashness. As to 
the veto message, I am delighted with it. It has all the fury of 
a chained panther, biting the bars of his cage. It is really a 
manifesto of anarchy, such as Marat or Robespierre might have 
issued to the mob of the Faubourg St. Antoine ; and my hope 
is, that it will contribute to relieve the country from the dominion of these miserable people. You are destined to be the instrument of that deliverance, and at no period of your life has 
the country ever had a deeper stake in you. I wish you success, 
most cordially, because I believe the institutions of the Union 
are involved in it. 


SAMUEL L. SOUTHABD TO MR. CLAY. 

Trenton, December 1, 1832. 

My hear Sir, I should have written to you several days ago, 
but I feared that you would leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> before my letter 
reached there. 

I am in deep distress at the situation of our country. I fear 
that the Union and Government are gone. Nothing can save 
them but a wisdom and patriotism which I almost despair of 
finding, in the present day of madness. I should despair, if I 
did not feel, that a citizen can commit no crime short of treason, 
worse than to despair of the Republic. 

The recent elections have greatly astonished me. Even in. 
New Jersey, no one of any party, who was well inforaied, doubted 
a different result. We owe our defeat to two causes The overconfidence of our friends, who feared no danger, and the course 
of the Anti-Masons. We were assured that they would support 
our ticket, in preference to General Jackson's, until the last 
moment ; but the result shows that my early and constant fears 
respecting them were well founded. They tried me painfully. 

I am now myself in as unpleasant a condition as any man can 
well be. Forced into an annual office, to gratify my friends, 
and promote the success of the party giving up a practice 
necessary for the comfort of myself and family, and destined, in 
all probabiliy, to be cast out in another year. But for myself I 
care little. I have never looked to popular favor for happiness, 
nor to office for support. I have always given more than I received when I have accepted public stations. 

There are many who wish me to change my position to the 
Senate, in place of Dickenson, under the belief that I can, in the 
present melancholy times, do more good to the country there 
than where I now am. Whether this will be the wish of the 
 

joint meeting in January I know not. I took this office with no 
anticipations of good to myself. I felt it a sacrifice of myself to 
my country, and I am now content to remain in it ; and while I do, 
let the period be short or long, to do my duty, and my whole 
duty, fearlessly and fully, and meet, without flinching, ail consequences. What shall I do ? Of the future I anticipate nothing 
of good to the country, unless trials and calamities may open 
blind eyes. What are we to do with South Carolina ? Do tell 
me your plan prophecy for me. I would write on that topic, I 
intended to do so when I began, but my time is out. Other 
duties call me. Let me hear from you, and fully. 


MRS. ERWIN TO HER TATHER, MR. CLAY. 

The Woodlands, December 13, 1832. 

My DEAR Father, I suppose, by the time this reaches you, 
that you will have arrived safely at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. We heard 
from you at Wheeling, but not since ; you have been seeing new 
faces and new things every day, while we have been going on 
in the same quiet routine I will not say dull— that you left us 
in. The only change in our society is the arrival of Henry and 
Julia from Louisiana ; they came a week since, and are at Posttethwaites. They have been out frequently, and we all spent a 
very pleasant day yesterday with mamma, whom we found in 
good health and spirits. Theodore went home the day after you 
left, and although mamma is now fully convinced that he is deranged, he has so far conducted himself quietly, and she is 
much happier than if he were any where else. 

Henry has recommenced the study of the law with increased 
energy. He is disgusted with the prospect of making a living 
at the bar in Kentucky, and as a last determination, which he 
does not intend to change, he is to go to New Orleans in February, and at last open an office this winter, preparatory to commencing business next year. This I think a wise course, and I 
hope he will persevere in it. His health and spirits are better 
than when he left us. 

Nothing has occurred worth noticing in the family, except the 
very sudden death of Alfred Shelby, who fell in a fit of apoplexy, and died a few hours afterward. Mrs. M. Hai-rison gave 
birth to a fine son on Saturday, who, I hope, will not prove, like 
his father, a good Jackson man. 

We are positively to leave on the 15th, that is, day after 
to-morrow, and we have every prospect of a quick and pleasant 
passage, as the weather is fine, and both rivers in fine order. I 
leave the boys with mamma. I expect they will occasion me to 
return very early in the spring. 

Give my love to all those who may be so kind as to inquire 
for me, and particularly to James ; do, my dear father, make 
him write me to New Orleans, if you can not find time to do so 
yom'self. Mr. Denton begs to be respectfully remembered to 
you. Mr. Erwin and the children join me in love to you. 



REVEBDY JOHNSON TO MR. CLAY. 

Baltimore, February 13, 1833. 

My dear Sir, You will pardon me, I am sure, for trespassing a moment upon your time, in thanking you for the effort 
you are making to quiet the unhappy and alarming dissentions 
of the country. Like yourself, decidedly friendly to the protection of domestic industry, I am satisfied, and have been satisfied for some time, that nothing but a liberal spirit of compromise can save the system from almost immediate destruction. 
The incalculable mischief which, in a mere pecuniary point of 
view, this will bring upon us, is, of itself, alarming enough, but 
it is comparatively insignificant, when contrasted with the strong 
probability, that it may cause a struggle vital to the Union itself. 
The plan which you have proposed, will, I think, if any plan 
can accomplish it, save the manufacturers for the time, and in its 
consequences (gradually brought about) open the eyes of oiuSouthern brethren to the manifold benefits of the system which 
they have so violently opposed. I can not but believe, that a 
few years of quiet and sober reflection will satisfy them that their 
present hostility to the prevailing policy, is the merest creation of prejudice that was ever known, and that their true interests, like that of their Northern countrymen, is in protecting the 
nation and its industry, against foreign restrictions. God grant 
that your efforts may prove successful, and that we may again 
see our country not only, as it is, prosperous in. fact, but happy 
and free in the estimation of every citizen of the Government. 

I repeat that I am satisfied you will take this communication 
in the spirit in which it is sent, and consider me as authorized 
to suppose that you will receive it in all kindness. 




JOHN M. CLAYTON TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, February 20, 1833. 

My dear Friend, Prepare yourself fully for the debate tomorrow. We shall hear a labored speech from our opponents. 

To-morrow will be the most eventful period of your eventful 
life. Your friends depend on your efforts, and I as one of them 
suggest to you this thought consider whether it be not your 
best course to declare in your speech on the bill that you are no 
candidate for the honors of office that you look only to the 
imperishable glory of preventing civil war and again uniting 
your distracted countrymen in the bonds of fraternal affection, 
while at the same time you insure the continuation, the perpetuity of that great system with which your fame is identified. I 
advise this course at present. We have a yawning gulf in our 
Rome, and it will never close till some patriot rides into it. 
This will stop the cry of coalition, save yourself and your 
friends from calumny, and your country from ruin. 



NICHOLAS BIDDLE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, February 28, 1833. 

My dear Sir, I have a great deal to say, or rather to ask, 
about the manner in which you have been able to draw out the 
lightning from all the clouds which were lowering over the 
country ; but I will not trouble you now, and I only hope that 
you will come up when the session is over, and talk into conviction all the doubters, even my friend Mr. Walsh himself. The 
fact is, that for forty-eight hours your friends held in their breath 
with anxiety, till they saw you fairly across the chasm, and are 
proportionally gratified at seeing you in such a firm and commanding position. Of all this hereafter, when you come to see 
us. What makes me write now is, that I think you may find an 
opportunity on Saturday or Sunday of saying a few words which 
may make a strong and favorable impression upon two large 
masses of the community whom I wish to see well disposed to 
you, especially at the present moment. I mean the friends of 
the Bank and the Western States generally. 


chief justice MARSHALL, to MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, March 13, 1833. 

Dear Sir, My nephew, Marshall Jones, purposes to remove 
to New Orleans with a view to the practice of the law, and is, 
I believe, now in that place. The circumstances under which 
 

he left Virginia increase my solicitude for his success. A personal renconter with a young gentleman who had abused him 
wantonly and grossly, terminated very unfortunately in the death 
of his adversary. This compelled him to fly from Virginia and 
from very flattering professional prospects. After visiting Canada 
and Texas, he has at length, I am told, determined on trying his 
fortune in New Orleans. I am extremely desirous of promoting 
his object, but with the exception of Mr. Johnston, am not acquainted with a single individual in that place. May I ask the 
favor of you to mention him to some of your friends, not as a 
person known to yourself, but as my friend and relation whom I 
strongly recommend. I have the most entire confidence in his 
honor, integrity, and amiable qualities ; and shall feel myself 
greatly obliged by your bestowing on him so much of your countenance as may favor his introduction into society, and his professional exertions. For the rest, he must depend upon himself. 
With great respect and esteem I am, dear sir, your obedient 
servant. 



PELEG SPEAGUE TO MR. CLAY. 

Boston, March 19, 1SS3. 

Deab Sir, It affords me the highest gratification to be able 
to assure you that public sentiment here has wonderfully changed 
in favor of your great measure, since its introduction. It is now 
popular, and becoming more and more so as it becomes better 
understood, as the real condition of the country and of the views 
and opinions of the Administration ar6 more known, and as the 
bill itself and your course previous to its being offered in the 
Senate are explained. In New York I scarcely found an individual who did not approve it. In Providence and in Boston there 
is yet some diversity of opinion among the pohticians, but so 
far as I learn none among the actual business men, engaged in 
manufactm-es. I have seen several of the principal and most intelligent ; they are only apprehensive that it will not be permanent, that it will be again put afloat. They say that they do 
not think fit to come out publicly in favor of the measure, because it might create uneasiness in the South, and generate a disposition to make further demands, and because it would carry a 
censure upon their delegation in Congress. I have seen and 
conversed with many of the principal men, and was at first surprised that there was so much of error and misapprehension in 
nearly all in relation to the bill. I yesterday spent nearly an 
hour in conversation upon this subject with the Governor, most 
of the members of his Council being present, and I also have 
conversed with the Lieutenant-Governor, the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, several members of the Senate, and 
many members of the House, with Crowningshield and Dwight, 
formerly members of Congress, with both the Everett's, President Uuincy, the Lawrences, and many other merchants and 
manufacturers, whose names are unknown to you ; and I can 
not doubt from their representations that the bill is now considered a good one, and will be extremely popular when fully 
understood. Indeed I am entirely mistaken if, in six months, it 
be not considered in Nev/ England as the most wise, patriotic, 
 

beneficent and splendid act of legislation that any individual in 
this country has ever achieved. It ought not to be matter of 
surprise that some time is required to bring the public here to a 
correct understanding of the measure, for every member of their 
delegation, in whom they have justly so much confidence, voted 
against it, and some, in the early stages, united in a feeling of 
hostility to it. The debate has not yet been published, which 
is very unfortunate, and the impressions of the nature of the bill 
have been received from the objections which are understood to 
have been made to it in the Senate. I have found the impression almost universal that it relinquished the principle of protection after 1842, and not one have I seen here, as I recollect, who 
did not think that after that period the duties were to be equal 
on all articles, except such as the bill itself specified should be 
free. I have, ever since I arrived in New York, carried the bill 
in my pocket in order to convince them of this error, which has 
always been the first and prominent objection, and I have not 
met with one to whom I have had an opportunity to present the 
truth, who has not been satisfied, and wondered how they should 
have been so mistaken. I have made it a business, since my 
arrival here, to put the matter right, and also to correct another 
erroneous impression which has been the source of much prejudice from the beginning, and that is that your course was adopted without consultation with your Tariff friends, and operated 
as a surprise upon them all, and particularly upon Mr. W. I 
have taken the liberty, every where and upon all occasions, to 
state the truth upon this point, which I know. I thought myself not only at liberty, but bound, in justice to yourself, to make 
your course known, and have been delighted to find how relieved and rejoiced your friends here have invariably been to learn 
the truth. I have not hesitated to state the conferences which 
were had, formal and informal, the propositions and suggestions 
which you submitted, and the remarks of Mr. W. and others. 
Rely upon it the intelligent men here are getting to understand 
the subject ; it requires but a few persons to explain it, and it will 
be highly satisfactory and almost universally popular. I regret 
deeply that the debate has not been published, while the public 
mind is awake and inquisitive in regard to it, especially as all the 
members from this State were opposed to it in their votes, and 
of course are stopped from saying much in its favor. I shall remain here several days longer, and shall see a great many more 

of their intelligent and leading men, and I have no donht all 
will be satisfied except a particular, and I trust very limited class 
of politicians, who wished to carry matters to extremities with 
South Carolina, and to see her put down, prostrated by force of 
arms, and with whom this feeling was paramount to any regard 
for the Tariff. 

Excuse me for writing so much, and so many repetitions, but 
the subject is one in which every hour's reflection and observation increases my interest, and I have the strongest solicitude 
that every body should view this splendid and glorious act as I 
do, and appreciate and do justice to the mover, which I have no 
doubt they will. Your promised visit here is looked forward to 
with great eagerness. Your reception will be all that you can 
wish. You must not disappoint them, nor us in Maine. 

N. B. Since the passage of your bill there has been a material rise in the value and market price of almost all manufacturing stocks, and of wool, and woolen goods, which is extending now to cottons, and other articles. An infallible test of the 
real opinion of the interested. 



NICHOLAS BIDDLE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, March 25, 1833. 

My dear Sir, I duly received yom- last favor from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and did not fail to bear in mind its interesting contents. It 
confirmed an opinion previously formed, confirmed by subsequent reflection, and since repeatedly declared, that it was of 
great importance to the country not to permit the difference of 
sentiment on the Tariff to produce any alienation between those 
who had hitherto acted in concert on all the other great public 
measures ; and that more especially no estrangement should be 
allowed to grow up between the two most prominent leaders 
who were opposed on that question. Daring the visit of our 
friend, I was in habits of constant and confidential intercourse 
with him. In regard to the measure itself, he retains all the 
opinions which he publicly expressed ; but they are, I think, unaccompanied by any thing of an unkind or unfriendly feeling 
toward yourself, as you will perceive when the speech made on 
that occasion is published. There was a strong disposition 
 

among many of his friends, to give him a pubKc dinner ; but this 
I discouraged, because I feared that it might obHge him to say 
i more on that subject than it is prudent to express at the present 
time, and because it would probably furnish an occasion for his 
less discreet friends to do and to say things excusable at a moment of excitement, but which might afterward be regretted. 
.For such an exhibition, I substituted a large meeting of gentlemen at my own house, where his friends could have the pleasure 
of seeing him, without imposing upon him the necessity of 
making any exposition of his views on any subject. I stated to 
him without reserve, the share which I had taken in preventing 
a public dinner, and my reasons for it, in the propriety of which 
he entirely acquiesced. In short, he has left us two days ago, 
in a frame of mind entirely satisfactory, and your mutual friends 
seem to understand each other perfectly, that there ought not to 
be, and that there shall not be, any alienation between you, however you may have differed on one measure of policy. For myself, I entertain for him so sincere an attachment, that I should, 
have been greatly pained at a different result. These good dispositions will, I doubt not, be strengthened during the visit 
which we meditate, to your country, in the course of the spring, 
since no one can be insensible to the attractions of personal intercourse with you. Few, I need not add, appreciate that pleasure more highly than yours, with great respect, etc. 



ABBOTT LAWRENCE TO MR. CLAY. 

Boston, March 26, 1833. 

My dear Sir, I have great pleasure in acknowledging the 
receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., with your speech upon 
the Tariff Bill. 

Your letter gave me iudividually, inexpressible pleasure, as it 
has placed in my power the means of satisfying the minds of 
many prominent citizens among us, who had supposed the whole 
scheme was brought forward without the knowledge of your 
friends. I have given the letter free circulation where it has 
been required, to remove any prejudices that might have existed, and I have a general response from all, that they are entirely satisfied with the purity of your motives, as well as your 
enlightened patriotism. The newspaper presses are now silent 
here upon the subject, and will remain so. I know the editors 
well, and have taken some pains to place the whole subject upon 
true ground. I had, as you know, strong objections to any concessions whatever ; yet T am now well satisfied with the course 
the whole subject took in Congress ; so are the people of this 
State, and of New England. Oar interests have been greatly 
promoted by it, and it is hoped and believed that time will prove 
to us that it was the dictate of wisdom to have adopted the bill 
proposed by you, and carried by your influence. I do not think 
there is the least unkind feeling toward you, in New England, 
and I do not take, I think, too much upon myself, when I say J 
you were never more popular than at the present moment. I 
look for a great change in public sentiment upon the American j 
system, before the end of nine years, or even five years. If 
the system of internal improvements could go on for a few years, 
with vigor, there is not a doubt upon my mind, that this Union 
would be bound by ties stronger than all the constitutions that 
human wisdom could devise. A railroad from New England to 
Georgia, would do more to harmonize the feelings of the whole 
country, than any amendments that can be offered or adopted to 
the Constitution. It is intercourse we want, and what I desire. 
Your Land bill is a great favorite here, and receives the hearty 
support of all parties, with the exception of some few officeholders. I wrote you about the 10th inst., at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>; 
when you write again, will you tell me whether it was received? 
I have only to ask you now when we may expect to welcome 
you here. I am often asked the question, and should be glad to 
answer it. Our mutual friend, Mr. Sprague, remained here four 
daj^s, and made the most of his time in explaining the principles 
of your bill, and the motives that influenced you in bringing it 
forward. I have a letter which he sent me from Mr. Senator 
Johnson, which is read in connection with yours of the 13th. 



MR. MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

Montpelier, April 2, 1833. 

Dear Sir, Accept my acknowledgments for the copy of your 
speech on the bill modifying the Tariff". I need not repeat what 
is said by all on the ability and advantages with which the subject was handled. It has certainly had the effect of an anodyne 
 

on the feverish excitement under which the pubHc mind was 
laboring ; and a relapse may happily not ensue. There is no 
certainty, however, that a surplus revenue will not revive the 
difficulty of adjusting an impost to the claims of the manufacturing and the feelings of the agricultural States. The effect of a 
reduction, including the protected articles, on the manufacturers 
is manifest ; and a discrimination in their favor will, besides the 
complaint of inequality, exhibit the protective principle, without 
disguise, to the protestors against its constitutionality. An alleviation of the difficulty may, perhaps, be found in such an 
apportionment of the tax on the protected articles most consumed 
in the South, and on the unprotected most consumed in the 
North, as will equalize the burden between them, and limit the 
advantage of the latter to the benefits flowing from a location of 
the manufacturing establishments. 

May there not be a more important alleviation in embryo ^an 
assimilation of the employment of labor in the South to its employment in the North ? A difference, and even a contrast, in 
that respect, is at the bottom of the discords which have prevailed, and would so continue, until the manufacturers of the 
North could, without a bounty, take the place of the foreign in 
supplying the South ; in which event, the source of discord 
would become a bond of interest, and the difference of pursuits 
more than equivalent to a similarity. In the mean time, an advance toward the latter must have an alleviating tendency. And 
does not this advance present itself in the certainty that, unless 
agriculture can find new markets for its products, or new products 
for its markets, the rapid increase of slave labor, and the still 
more rapid increase of its fruits, must divert a large portion of 
it from the plow and the hoe to the loom and the workshop? 
When we can no longer convert our flour, tobacco, cotton, and 
rice, into a supply of our habitual wants from abroad, labor must 
be withdrawn from those articles, and made to supply them at 
home. 

It is painful to turn from anticipations of this sort to the prospect, opened by the torch of discord, bequeathed by the Convention of South Carolina to its country, by the insidious exhibitions 
of a permanent incompatibility, and even hostility, of interests 
between the South and the North, and by the contagious zeal 
in vindicating and varnishing the doctrines of nullification and 
secession ; the tendency of all of which, whatever be the intention, is to create a disgust with the Union, and then to open the 
way out of it. We must oppose to this aspect of things confidence, that, as the gulf is approached, the deluded will recoil 
from its horrors, and that the deluders, if not themselves sufficiently startled, will be abandoned and overwhelmed by their 
followers. 

As we were disappointed of the expected visit last fall, from 
yourself and Mrs. Clay, we hope the promise will not be forgotten 
when the next opportunity occurs. For the present, Mrs. Madison joins in cordial regards and all good wishes to you both. 



JOHN SEBLET TO IHE. CLAT. 

K"atchitoches, May 22, 183S. 

Dear Sir, Illy fitted as my mind is to Avrite a letter at this 
time, and painful as the task is, I must in grief tell you that J. 
S. Johnston, and his son William, were, last Sunday morning, 
on board the steam-boat Lioness, on their way to make me a 
visit, when, about thirty-five miles above Alexandria, in Red 
River, a large quantity of powder in the hold of the boat exploded, and blew the boat to atoms. Fifteen or sixteen passengers were lost ; among them our friend Johnston.* William 
was blown ofl" a distance, much hurt, but not killed ; is, I hope, 
safe with his uncle, a few miles below where the disaster happened. His wife, my poor child, was left in bad health, in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. I can noAv only commend her to a merciful God, 
and implore your condolence to her. I will write you more 
particularly when I can. 


J. W. p. TO MR. CLAY. 

Petersburg, May 31, 1833. 

Respected Sir, The last speech which John Randolph, of 
Roanoke, ever delivered, was at the late Jockey Club dinner of 
our Newmarket races, to a party of about two hundred gentlemen. Inter alios , he alluded to yourself, somewhat thus : "I 
admire and respect such men (the old Federalists) far more than 
such Republicans as the Janus-faced editor of ' The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> 
Enquirer,' who has contrived to keep in with every Administration, save the short reign of John Adams the Second, and then 
he kept an anchor out to windward for Henry Clay, who, by 
the way, gentlemen, is a much better man than Ritchie. Clay 
is a brave man he is a consistent man, which Ritchie is not ; 
an independent man, and an honest man, which Ritchie is not." 

These remarks were responded to by the company with rapturous applause, and I now communicate them to you (privately 
and incognito), because I like to impart pleasure to a generous 
mind, and it must be some gratification to you to hear that these 
were the last public declarations of one of your most envenomed 
and distinguished political enemies, and that they were uttered 
and applauded in a part of our country which has been, hitherto, most decided in its opposition to you. 



MR. MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

Montpelier, June, 1833. 

Dear Sir, Your letter of May 28th was duly received. In 
it you ask my opinion on the retention of the Land bill by the 
President. 

It is obvious that the Constitution meant to allow the President an adequate time to consider the bills, etc., presented to 
him, and to make his objections to them ; and on the other 
hand, that Congress should have time to consider and overrule 
the objections. A disregard, on either side, of what it owes to 
the other, must be an abuse, for which it would be responsible 
under the forms of the Constitution. An abuse on the part of 
the President, with a view sufficiently manifest, in a case of sufficient magnitude to deprive Congress of the opportunity of overruling objections to their bills, might, doubtless, be a ground for 
impeachment. But nothing short of the signature of the President, or a lapse of ten days without a return of his objections, 
or an overruling of the objections by two thirds of each House 
of Congress, can give legal validity to a bill. In order to qualify (in the French sense of the term) the retention of the Land 
bill by the President, the first inquiry is. Whether a .sufficient 
time was allowed him to decide on its merits? The next, 
Whether, with a suflicient time to prepare his objections, he 
unnecessarily put it out of the power of Congress to decide on 
them ? How far an anticipated passage of the bill ought to enter 
into the sufficiency of the time for Executive deliberations, is 
another point for consideration. A minor one may be, whether 
a silent retention, or an assignment to Congress of the reasons 
for it, be the mode most suitable to such occasions. 

I hope, with you, that the compromising Tariff will have a 
course and effect avoiding a renewal of the contest between the 
South and the North, and that a lapse of nine or ten years will 
enable the manufacturers to swim without the bladders which 
have supported them. Many considerations favor such a prospect. They will be saved, in future, much of the expense in 
fixtures, which they had to encounter, and, in many instances, 
unnecessarily incurred. They will be continually improving in 
the management of their business. They will not fail to improve, occasionally, on the macliinery abroad. The reduction 
of duties on imported articles consumed by them will be equivalent to a direct bounty. There will probably be an increasing 
cheapness of food from the increasing redundancy of agricultural labor. There will, within the experimental period, be an 
addition of four or five millions to our population, no part, or 
little, of which will be needed for agricultural labor, and which 
will, consequently, be an extensive fund of manufacturing recruits. The current experience makes it probable, that not less 
than fifty or sixty thousand, or more, of emigrants, will annually 
each the United States, a large portion of whom will have been 
trained to manufactures, and be ready for that employment. 

With "respect to Virginia, it is quite probable, from the progress already made in the Western culture of tobacco, and the 
rapid exhaustion of her virgin soil, in which alone it can be cultivated with a chance of profit, that of the forty or fifty thousand laborers on tobacco the greater part will be released from 
the employment, and be applicable to that of manufactures. It 
is well known that the farming system requires much fewer 
hands than tobacco fields. 

It is painful to observe the unceasing efforts to alarm the South 
by imputations against the North of unconstitutional designs on 
the subject of the slaves. You are right, I have do doubt, in 
believing- that no such intermeddling disposition exists in the 
body of our northern brethren. Their good faith is sufficiently 
guaranteed by the interest they have, as merchants, as ship-owners, and as manufacturers, in preserving a union with the slaveholding States. On the other hand, what madness in the South 
to look for greater safety in disunion ! It would be worse than 
jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire. It would be jumping into the fire from a fear of the frying-pan. The danger 
from the alarm is, that the pride and resentment excited by them 
may be an overmatch for the dictates of prudence, and favor the 
project of a Southern Convention insidiously revived, as promising by its counsels the best securities against grievances of every 
sort from the North. 

The case of the Tariff and Land bills can not fail of an influence on the question of your return to the next session of Congress. They are both closely connected with the public repose. 


HARRISON GRAY OTIS TO MR. CLAY. 

Boston, October 22, 1833. 

My dear Sir, I had long indulged a most gratifying anticipation, that upon any visit you might make to this city, I should 
be among the foremost to receive you with a cordial welcome, 
and to promote among my fellow-citizens those public demonstrations of respect, to which your claims, to say the least, are, 
in my opinion, equal to those of any man in our country. My 
family also would have been too happy in uniting with me in 
every effort in our power to contribute toward making the stay 
of yours among us agreeable and convenient. The chagrin, 
therefore, which I should feel ina disappointment which forbids 
the accomplishment of these purposes, would be mortifying and 
deep, if arising from any human source. But we are under an 
affliction which comes from above, and precludes all emotions but 
those of anxiety and sorrow, and dispenses from all duties but 
those of resignation and obedience. My youngest son, the delight of our eyes and our lives, is suddenly arrested by disease, 
in the bloom and vigor of youth, and is, as his physicians fear, 
on his dying bed. This trouble is too serious to be mentioned 
as a ceremonious apology ; but I could not, without a sense of 
self disparagement, permit you to remain a visitor in my native 
city, under an impression that any ordinary cause would prevent 
me from showing you, by all that depends on me, • the sense 
which I think every man who loves his country should enter
* Mrs. Erwin, the mucli-loved child, and most worthy of it. We have heard 
Mr. Clay si^eak of her, many years after her decease, with the most tender emotion. He delighted to dwell on her character with a sympathizing friend 

tertain of the claims of a patriot, who has always carried his 
principles in front, and is ignorant of all political disguise, except 
that which he has seen worn by others, and whose public services have been, and, I trust, yet will be, of inappreciable value 
to his country. If I can trust myself to behave with decent 
firmness and composure, for ten minutes, I shall steal them, to 
take you by the hand. If I do not, accept from a full heart the 
wish that God Almighty may secure you and yours in his holy 
keeping. 

I pray you not to think of replying to this. 


AMBROSE SPENCER TO MR. CLAY. 

AxBANY, December 14, 1833, 
Dear Sir, Knowing that your time is wholly taken up in 
the arduous duties before you, I have hesitated to divert your attention a moment by any thing I can suggest ; but I am not willing 
that an acquaintance which gave me unspeakable pleasure, should 
be suffered to fade away. If you have not leisure to answer my 
letters I assure you that your silence will give me no offense. 
You can hardly conceive what favorable impressions your short 
visit among us created. Those who were prepared to love and admire you, were confirmed in all their anticipations, and they admire 
and love you with the more intensity ; and even those who have 
been in the habit of thinking and speaking unkindly of you, 
were generally compelled to think better of you. I revert to the 
few happy hours I spent in your company with renewed delight. 
You may say this is flattery ; but if, you understood my charac 
ter, this is a vice never imputed to me by friend or foe, but 
enough of this. 

*^ ^ ^ JC. ,&£. 4£,

I am aware that it is quite premature to think or speak of the 
next Presidential candidate, but it seems that, nolens volens, the 
press will talk of it, and consequently the public will think of it. 
In my opinion the national Republicans ought to keep themselves 
wholly uncommitted, unless a great change should take place in 
the public mind, and the prejudices of party be greatly abated, 
the 'annunciation of any one of our distinguished friends would 
have the effect to unite the whole Jackson phalanx on some one 
of their leaders, and I think MR.Van Buren would probably be 
that man. From present appearances the contest on the part of 
our adversaries will be between Van Buren. Judge M'Lean, and 
Mr. Cass. I had no opportunity to obtain your opinions of the 
two latter, but I confess I feel strong repugnance to both of 
tliem. The question is not whether they are as unprincipled as 
Jackson, for I console myself with the belief that we, under no 
circumstances, can elect a worse, or more incompetent man. If 
we are driven to a choice between the three, which of them 
will be the least mischievous ? M'Lean's judicial coiu'se has 
been Jesuitical and trimming, and it will be a strong objection 
to him that he enters the arena with the robes of office on. As 
to Cass, I once thought well of him ; but did he not write an 
 

article in the " North American Review" expressly to propitiate 
the favor of Jackson, chiming in with his crude notions that Georgia had a right to abrogate the laws, etc., of the Cherokees and 
subject them to their jurisdiction ? This was in July, 1830. Did 
he not write an essay for " The Globe" reviewing Judge Marshall's 
opinions in the case of the Missourians, to prepare the public 
mind for the President's refusal to obey and carry into effect the 
mandate of the court ? Is he not the one of the Cabinet who 
gave an oral opinion against removing the deposits, but saying 
if they were removed he would stand by the President ? If he 
has done all or any of these things, he is a fit instrument for a 
tyrant, and I despise him. Can you enlighten me on any of these 
matters at a leisure moment ? 

I feel as I did when I saw you, most desponding at the prospect before us, and yet were I called to act, I would, if possible, 
nerve myself for the contest and fight the battle on the last inch 
of ground left. 

Excuse, I pray you, my want of method. I write on just as I 
feel. We are all well. Present my respects to Mrs. Clay and 
say to her, Mrs. Spencer presents her respects and will long remember her with affection. 

P. S. Mrs. De Witt Clinton told me she regretted very much 
you did not call on her. She has not one remaining prejudice 
against you, and her husband's were conceived in error, and 
were, I doubt not, produced by misrepresentation. 


ERASTUS ROOT TO MR. CLAY. 

Delhi, January 12, 1834. 

Dear Sir, I have read your speeches on the removal of the 
Deposits with much pleasure and deep interest. I perceive in 
them that force of argument and that commanding eloquence 
which I was wont to witness in former days, in the efforts of 
Henry Clay, in the cause of liberty and the Constitution. 

When, my dear sii", will the mad career of the " military 

chieftain" be checked ? or is it never to meet with a check .' 
Will a thoughtless multitude, led on or encom-aged by knavish 
politicians, always sing pa3ans of praise to the usurpations of a 
despot, if emblazoned with military renown ? I fear the 
splendid and enormous bribe he has seized, and is now distributing, will insure the object of his wishes the succession to his 
throne. 

Under the Constitution, as now understood, is the Secretary 
of the Treasury an officer impeachable for high crimes and misdemeanors ? Can the instrument be convicted of the crime it 
has perpetrated ? He might be forfeited as a deodand. 

In your speeches on this occasion, I discover the same ardent 
patriotism, the same devotion to public and personal liberty 
which I so much admired when associated with you in the 
House of Representatives ; but from what you hinted to me last 
winter, I have some reason to fear that when the repeal of the 
Force bill shall come under consideration, in your House, you 
will cause me to regret a blot in your bright escutcheon. You 
were not present on the final passage of that odious bill, but I 
got the idea (I hope an erroneous one) that had you been present, 
you might have voted for it. With the sword and the purse, 
and that bill at his command, an American Cassar might sink 
into comparative insignificance that puny whipster of a Caesar 
whom you so eloquently described as swaying the final destinies 
of Rome. A part, and the most odious part, of the Force bill, 
I believe, will expire with the present session, but the Statute 
Book ought to be purged of that foul stain. 


MR. TAZEWELL TO MR. CLAY. 

Norfolk, February 19, 1834. 

Deab Sir, An absence from this place for some weeks past 
has prevented me from receiving your favor of the 1st instant, 
until a short time since. I now hasten to reply to it, merely to 
give you some evidence of the consideration with which I regard any communication of yours. The opinion you asked of 
me upon the abstract question you proposed, even if entitled to 
more respect than my opinions ought ever to receive from you, 
can be of but little value now, when all the difficulties we encounter proceed from the practical operation of measures, which, 
whether they may be traced to usurpation or to the mere abuse 
of power, reach the same actual results. But as you have asked 
my opinion, I will give it to you freely. 

Many years ago, soon after I became a member of the Senate, 
and before you last entered that body, I was under the necessity 
of discussing this question at large ; and to that end I then examined it very carefully. The result of this examination was 
the conviction of my own mind, that all the executive power 
created by the Federal Constitution was confided thereby to the 
President, to be exercised by him at his discretion, and upon his 
high responsibility, except in the cases of appointments and of 
treaties, if indeed the latter may be considered as an executive 
power under this Constitution, [n this opinion the majority of 
the Senate then concurred. 

Under this view of the subject, it seemed to me of little use 
to inquire, in regard to the power of removal from office, whether 
this was a substantive power or one merely accessorial to the 
power of appointment. For, as it was clearly an executive 
power, if it was a substantive power, it would then be embraced 
in the general Grant of all executive power, which, by the Constitution, is given to the President ; and if it was but an accessorial power, it must follow its principal, and appertain to the 
same functionary, to whom the principal power of appointment 
was granted by the Constitution in terms, although in the exercise of the power of appointment, he was required to consult 
his advisory council, the Senate. 

This conclusion seemed to me the more apparent when I adverted to the other powers that are, obviously, merely accessorial 
to the power of appointment, such as the power of nominating to office, and of commissionitig. No one could suppose that the 
Senate enjoyed either of these powers, aUhough the Constitution 
required of the President to obtain their advice and consent, before he could exercise his power of appointment. The only reason for this is, that while the Constitution exacts of the President the duty of consulting the Senate in all cases of appointment, it imposes upon him no such obligation with regard to 
nominations or commissions. Then, as the exclusive right of 
the President to these new auxiliary powers must be conceded, I 
could discover no reason for denying to him the similar right to 
the other auxiliary power of removal, as to which also the Constitution was equally silent. 

The treaty-making power, too, seemed to me to furnish a 
strong illustration of the correctness of my position. Whether, 
under the Federal Constitution, this ought to be considered as 
an executive or legislative power, in either case it must carry 
with it the accessorial powers of negotiation and ratification. 
Now although the consent of the Senate was required to give 
validity to every treaty, yet none could suppose that the advice 
of this body was requisite to justify the President in commencing a negotiation, or that he v/as bound to ratify a treaty because 
the Senate had consented that this might be done. 

In the course of this debate, it was said by some Senator, 
that whatever might be the case elsewhere, under the Federal 
Constitution, the power of appointment was not an executive 
power, but belonged to an anomalous class, because it was confided to other depositaries than the executive ; that being an 
anomalous power, all its incidents must partake of this character, 
and appertain to the same depositaries to whom the principal 
power was intrusted by the Constitution. 

I could not admit the general character of the depositary to 
be the proper test by which to ascertain the nature of the power 
confided, especially as all our Constitutions furnished many examples of the grants of power admitted to be purely executive 
to mere legislative or judicial functionaries. It seemed to me 
more correct to say that the character of the depositary was 
changed quo ad hoc, than that of the power granted. I denied, 
therefore, that the power of appointment was an anomalous 
power, and contended that it was strictly executive. I could not 
admit either that this power of appointment was confided to the 
Senate, merely because the President was required to consult 

them before he exercised it effectually. As well might it be 
said, that the veto allowed to the President by the Constitution 
constituted him a part of the Legislature. In either case, the 
powers granted were negative, and not positive, and therefore 
could not be considered as active powers, which all legislative 
and executive powers must be. The Senate, in the case of 
appointments, were authorized to give or to withhold their consent when asked by the President ; but they had no authority to 
proffer their advice unasked ; nor was the President bound to 
follow it when properly given, although he could not act without 
it. Therefore, the po\ver appertained to him and not to them. 
I could not discern how the character of the power granted, let 
this be ascertained how it might, could influence in any way the 
question of incidental authority. The accessory must follow its 
principal, whatever might be the name or nature of that principal. If they are once separated, and the powers confided to 
different hands, the accessory changes its character immediately, 
and becomes a new principal power, the matrix of other incidents. Otherwise, the greatest absurdities, and the most irreconcileable conflicts, would ensue. 

But I will not fatigue you with any further repetition of the 
arguments then urged, except to say that it appeared to me 
manifestly absurd to regard the President as responsible for the 
acts of subordinate agents, and yet to deny to him the uncontrolled power of supervising them, and of removing them from 
office whenever they had lost his confidence. 

While announcing these opinions, justice to myself requires of 
me to add, that in claiming for the President the exclusive right 
to all the executive power created by the Federal Constitution, 
I hold him accountable to Congress, to the people, and to the 
States, for every misuse of the discretionary power so granted to 
him. Believing that all the powers of all our Governments are 
derivative and not sovereign, I can not recognize any other than 
a mere verbal distinction between the abuse and the usurpation 
of any power. None can have the right to do wrong, although 
in cases where no tribunal exists to determine what is wrong, 
the mere possession of power must necessarily be regarded as the 
sole evidence of the right to use it at will. But in this country, 
where all political powers are granted, and therefore limited, 
there always exists a tribunal competent to decide upon the 
legitimate extent of powers. Here, then, the abuse of power 
 

granted is both in kind and in degree, an equal offense with the 
usurpation of power not granted, unless we could conceive the 
impossible case of power granted to be abused. 

I have never heard any so wild as to claim for the President 
any other executive powers than such as are created by the 
Federal Constitution. Nor have I supposed that any could be 
so foolish as to regard what is called executive power in England, or in any other country, as the measure and standard of 
such power here. The absurdity of such a pretension is so 
monstrous, that I can not consider it as meriting any serious refutation. Once admit it to be true, and the Constitution would 
become a dead letter. We should then be sent abroad to learn 
the nature of our own Government, and might soon see the 
President proroguing, or even dissolving Congress at his pleasure, 
nay, creating a peerage, declaring war, and concluding treaties, 
without consulting any other department of the Government. 

It will always give me pleasure to hear from you. Our principles may not, perhaps, be in exact accordance, nor shall we 
always agree in the application of those in which we do concur. 
But we have each seen so much of the world now as not to 
consider such diversities as either injurious to its interests, or as 
constituting any proper cause to disturb relations that, with us, 
have been of long standing. 


ALEXANDER COFFIN TO MR. CLAY. 

Hudson, Netv Yoek, May 12, 1834. 
Sir, ^Nearly a century has passed over my head ; and, although I have witnessed, with much apprehension for the result, 
many hazardous scenes which my dear native country has struggled through in that time, not one has excited that trembling 
sense of alarm which the measures of the present Executive 
have done. I have remarked, in their whole course, an unbridled lust of power, that attacked the very foundation of our 
free institutions. And, notwithstanding, a temperament naturally 
sanguine leads me to contemplate things under a cheering 

aspect, when I beheld his bold claims to lawless power sustained 
by men in whom I had placed trust. I confess a very gloomy 
prospect of the future presented itself; my spirit sunk within 
me ; and I began "to despair of the Republic." But, thanks be 
to God, who breathed into a phalanx of good men in the Senate 
of the United States, a spirit to breast the storm ; and has enabled them, as I hope, to rescue the country from the danger 
that impended over it. Allow me to testify to you, sir, as a distinguished individual in that phalanx, my respect, together with 
my thanks, for the very important share you bore in that conflict ; and also, to tender my most hearty congratulations upon 
the prospect we now enjoy of seeing the Constitution and laws, 
redeemed from the grasp of usurpation, restored to healthy action. 
May I beg you to accept, from a man far advanced in his 94th 
year, the cane which will be handed you herewith, as a token 
of his gratitude for your eminent services rendered to our beloved country ? It was made from the jawbone of a spermaceti 
whale, the head from a tooth of the same, by the mate of a ship 
belonging to one of my grandsons, upon her homeward passage 
from the Pacific. 



JOHN NITCHIE TO MR. CLAY. 

American Bible Society, New York, 
July 5, 1834. 

Sir, It affords me much pleasure to inclose to you a certificate of your membership for life in this society. The occasion 
of your being made a Life Member you will find from the extract 
of the letter of the individual making the needful contribution 
which is copied on the back of the certificate. 

Permit me, respected sir. in the name of the benevolent, but 
anonymous donor, to ask your acceptancy of this compliment ; 
and also, to assure you, of my earnest desire that you and yours 
may have an eternal interest in the promises of that blessed 
Book, which it is the design of this Society to spread abroad 
among the nations of' this fallen world. 

if. 

Extract of a letter to John Nitchie, General Agent and Assistant Treasure!' of the American Bible Society^ dated July 3, 
1834. 

Dear Friend, I send you the sum of thirty dollars, which I 
will thank you to present to the managers of the American Bible 
Society, to be devoted by them to the circulation of the Holy 
Scriptures, ^ 

In consequence of this contribution, you will please enroll the 
name of the Honorable Henry Clay, of the United States Senate, 
among your Life Members. 

The above is from a friend, which has arisen from the continued savings of a Missionary, by his laying aside portions of fees 
and presents at the time they were received ; the entire amount 
of fees received on Sunday and Thursday of every week, also, 
free-will offerings under peculiar Providences: one tenth of his 
regular salary, and one tenth of the balance of his receipts during the year over his family expenses. 

You will please forward to Mr. Clay, a certificate of his Life 
Membership ; also, beg him to lay aside a portion of his income, 
and thus constitute in like manner, at least one of his friends, a 
Life Member of your important society, and in so doing, I would 
beg him to request that friend thus constituted, to constitute 
some other individual a Life Member. In this way passing the 
excitement round from friend to friend, an amount of good will 
accumulate, which the full glories of the Eternal World alone 
can unfold. 

This is to certify, that Honorable Henby Clay, of the United 
States Senate, by virtue of a contribution of thirty dollars, made 
by a clergyman of the Protestant Episcopal Church, is a Member for Life of the American Bible' Society, New York, July 
5th, 1834.

FRANCIS LIEBER TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, November 8, 1834. 
My dear Sir, I feel convinced that you will not ascribe my 
delay in answering your favor to any unsubstantial reason ; on 
the contrary, I. did not write immediately, because I was desirous of writing to you as definitely as possible. My wish is to 
see you in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, and to become personally acquainted with 
the College, etc., as well as to give those, who might desire to 
engage me for the College, an opportunity of personal acquaint- ^ 
ance. The salary, as you yourself intimate, is not large, and I ' 
should not be able to incur the expenses of removing thither, ' 
and furnishing there my house again, if I had not some hopes J 
of being able to have some young gentlemen living in my house, j 

I should ere this have set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, had I not actually | 
been engaged in the publication of a work, which made my \ 
stay here indispensable. ■ 

I send you in the mean time a testimonial, such as you mention. If more are desired, I may send more from here, as , 
Messrs. Joseph IngersoU, Sergeant, N. Biddle, Richard Peters, or .^ 
in fact any gentleman of note here or in Boston, might be applied to. J 

If you should make a trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, in the course of 
this winter, I would beg you to send me word that you are in 
town (in case that you should be here only for a day or two) ; 
you would greatly favor me with a personal interview. 

Politics seem, this moment, so sickening, that we avoid speaking of them, whenever possible. News, of the very worst kind, 
are here from New York. We are already in a revolution, as 
nations so often are long before they know it. " The Globe" 
plays very cheering preludes with regard to attacks upon the 
Supreme Court. My letters from Europe are of the worst kind, 
with reference to the moral influence of our general affairs on 
those of rational freedom, and the sway of law in that part of 
the world. 

A letter from you, though it consist but in a few lines, is always a great delight to me ; and you will much oblige me by 
informing me whether this letter has not perhaps missed you. 
Please present my best respects to Mrs. Clay, who, I trust, has 
continued to improve in health. 



NICHOLAS BIDDLE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, January 4, 1835. 

My dear Sir, ^I have been thinking for some days past 
whether the time had not come when another interposition of 
yours is not needed to save the country from great trouble. In 
all this French negotiation, mismanaged as it has been from the 
beginning, nothing is so inexplicable as the manner in which 
 

the overture of France has been treated, and I have been looking 
for some movement from you for the production of all that will 
be told of that communication. You know, I presume, the contents of it if you have not seen it all ; at any rate, you are 
sufficiently aware of the dates and circumstances, which would 
enable you to make a distinct call. If I do not mistake, Mr. 
Pageot communicated it on the 11th of September, a few days 
before the orders went which will occasion Mr. Barton's return. 

On the 2d of December he sent it with a letter to the Department, and although it was sent back, yet his letter might be 
called for. 

It seems to me that this dispatch of the Duke de Broglie ought 
to have settled the matter in five minutes : and yet the country 
is to be cursed with a quarrel in which every disadvantage is on 
our side. 

If there is any thing connected with it which you wish to 
know, I think I can obtain the information ; and I forbear to 
add any thing, because I am under the impression that you are 
apprised of the whole. Had you been at the head of the Government, and the French ministry had said that they would deem 
that a happy day, when they would be able to surrender this 
sum deposited in their hands, you would certainly have thrown 
no unnecessary obstacle in their way. 



CHANCELLOR KENT TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, January 9, 1835. 

My dear Sir, Let me remind you to send me, when printed, 
one of the twenty thousand copies of your Report. I rather guess 
I shall like it. Like it ! why, God bless you, I sympathize with 
you in all your public feelings and doings since the beginning of 
the reign of the present dynasty. My prayer is, that length of 
days may be in your right hand, and in your left hand riches 
and honor. 



ELEUTH COOKE TO MR. CLAY. 

Sandusky Citt, January 22, 1835. 
Dear Sir, I can not withhold from you the heartfelt expression of applause with which the Report of the Committee on 
Foreign Relations, in reference to our affairs with France, has 
been received in this quarter. All see, and most acknowledge, 
in it the evidence of that enlightened patriotism and consummate 
statesmanship which have more than once elevated the character 
of our country, and rescued it from impending dangers. Whatever has been, and whatever may continue to be, the measure 
of injustice and ingratitude to its author, by that country, now 
thrice saved by his wisdom, posterity can not fail to assign him 
ample justice on her brightest page. 

Excuse this frankness ; you know it is not flattery. I speak 
from the midst of those who at all times, and through all changes, 
have been your fixed and steadfast friends, not from a sordid hope 
of favor, but from an admiration of your exalted talents, your 
lofty independence, and a love of your principles. 

God knows what we are to do to preserve our country. Pressed 
as you must be with public duties, I dare not ask you (confidentially) what are the prospects ? 


MR. MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

MoNTPELiER, January 31, 1835. 

Dear Sir, Perceiving that I am indebted to you for a copy 
of your Report on our Relations with France, I beg you to accept 
this return of my thanks for it. The document is as able in its 
execution as it is laudable in its object of avoiding war without 
incurring dishonor. 

It must be the wish of all that the issue may correspond with 
the object. But may not a danger of rupture lurk under the 
conflicting grounds taken on the two sides ? That taken by the 
Message, and by the Report also, in a softened tone, that the 
treaty is binding on France, and is in no event to be touched ; 
and the ground taken, or likely to be taken by France, with 
feelings roused by the peremptory alternative of compliance or 
self-redress, that the treaty is not binding on her, appealing for 
the fact to the structure of her Government, which all nations 
treating with her are presumed and bound to understand. 

It may be well for both parties if France should have yielded 
before the arrival of the Message, or not decided before that of 
the Report, or, at least, should not be inflexible in rejecting the 
terms of the treaty. A war between the two nations, which 
 

may cost them many millions, for a stake not exceeding a few, 
would be an occurrence peculiarly unpropitious to the cause of 
popular representation in the present crisis of the political 
world. 

War is the more to be avoided, if it can be done without inadmissible sacrifices, as a maritime war, to which the United 
States should be a party, and Great Britain neutral, has no aspect 
which is not of an ominous cast. Enforce the belligerent rights 
of search and seizure against British ships, and it would be a 
miracle if serious collisions did not ensue. Allow them the rule 
of " free ships, free goods," and the flag covers the property of 
Prance and enables her to employ all her naval resources against 
us. The tendency of the new rules in favor of the neutral flag 
is to displace the mercantile marine of nations at war, by neutral 
substitutes, and to confine the war on water as on land to the 
regular force ; a revolution friendly to humanity as lessening the 
temptations to war and the severity of its operations, but giving 
an advantage to the nations which keep up large navies in time 
of peace over nations dispensing with them, or compelling the 
latter to follow the burdensome example. France has at present 
this advantage over us in the extent of public ships now, or that 
may immediately be brought into service, while the privilege of 
the neutral flag would deprive us of the cheap and efficient aid 
of privateers. 

I do not relinquish the hope, however, that these views of the 
subject will be obviated by amicable and honorable adjustment. 

Should the course of your movements at any time approach 
Montpelier, I need not express the pleasure which a call from 
you would give to ]Mrs. Madison and myself. 



JOHN BROWN TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a>, Ap-il 20, 1835. 

Mr. C. J. Ingersol has given me the melancholy mtelligence 
of the death of my dear brother.* You may imagine, but it 
would be impossible for me to express how deeply, how painfully my feelings have been excited by this event. I understand that Charles Ingersol and my niece are absent on a jour
* James Brown, brother-in-law of Mr. Clay, and his correspondent for thirty 
years. 

ney for her health, and as I do not know that any person in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> has authority to take charge of my brother's effects, 
I have concluded that it was expedient that I should go on to 
attend to that business. It is certainly important that his papers 
shall be carefully preserved, and that his private correspondence 
shall not be exposed. I presume he has left a will, but know 
not who he has named executors. If you can give me any information on this subject, I pray you to drop me a hne by mail, 
and advise me how to proceed and inform what you would wish 
to have done. I expect to set out on Wednesday, or Thursday 
at furthest. 



STUDENTS OF <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> COLLEGE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, Pennsylvania, May 16, 1835. 

Sir, We take great pleasure, as a Committee of the " Clay 
Institute of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> College," in communicating your election as an honorary member of our Association. 

We offer you this inadequate testimonial of our esteem, not, 
we hope, from a spirit of man-worship, but from an honest admiration of your virtues as a statesman, a philanthropist, and a 
man. We do not expect that by it we will confer honor upon 
you, but rather, as was said in the epitaph of a distinguished 
poet, " That you will confer honor upon us." 

Permit us, sir, to request your acceptance of this humble tribute, and of our warmest wishes for your happiness through life. 



HARRIET MARTINEAU TO MR. CLAY. 

White Sulphur Springs, June 30. 

Dear Mr. Clay, Your frank, which overtook me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, was highly acceptable on its own account, as well as for 
the very delightful letters it inclosed from my mother and the 
Furnesses. My mother is in excellent health and spirits, and 
Mr. Furness writes me the happy news that his family will be 
in the neighborhood of Boston, and that he will preach there 
during the month of August, at least. 

We enjoyed our ten days' visit at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> very much, and 
found your kind introductions of eminent service. We staid 
 

longer there than we had intended, from finding it impossible 
to travel at all in the interior of the State. A gentleman escaped out of the mud to his home, at last; after traveling at the 
rate of one mile an hour a process which does not suit the 
taste or convenience of Miss Jeffery or myself. Our voyage and 
journey hither were quite prosperous, and the only disappointment 
we have met with is the non-arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. 
As we see and hear nothing of them, and as the Lorings are 
obliged to go (by Mr. L.'s physician's advice) to the Hot Springs, 
where we do not want to go, we have accepted the otfer of Mr. 
and Mrs. Sullivan of Boston, to travel together as far as Harper's Ferry. They have engaged an extra, which will afford us 
plenty of room, and have stipulated to be eight days on the 
road, seeing the Natural Bridge and Weir's Cave, by the way. 
As we are not in need of imbibing sulphur, and this pretty place 
is soon understood, we have no hesitation in embracing so very 
advantageous a plan of traveling, though it takes us away tomorrow. The Lorings flew to meet us on our arrival yesterday, 
and we find quite a throng of friends here from the Atlantic 
cities, and could make ourselves happy for a month, if we could 
stay so long. We shall leave our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> address in the 
post-ofRce, in case of the arrival of any letters ; but we expect 
no more from you. I almost hope there may be none, we have 
given you so much trouble already. 

Mr. Calwell will be most happy to see you ; and in the mean 
while, all has been done to fulfill your request about making us 
comfortable. We shall never forget how much we owe to yourself and very many of your friends to render our stay in this 
country happy. We shall always love Mr. and Mrs. Erwin like 
near and dear connections of our own. I hope Mrs. Clay and 
Mrs. Erwin are both better. Pray present our respects and love 
to all your circle, and believe me, dear sir, ever respectfully and 
gratefully your friend. 

P. S. Mr. Prather has been here a few days, improving hourly 
in health. He requests me to mention the safe arrival of the 
party, and that they are anxiously looking for Mr. and Mrs. 
Smith. I have been introduced to IMr. P. since I wrote the first 
part of this letter. 

I have also been weighed ; and find my ponderosity to be one 
hundred and sixteen pounds ; within two of ]\Ir. Erwin's guess; 

and Louisa weighs one hundred and ten. So now you know 
another important circumstance about us. Poor Mrs. Loring 
weighs only eighty-five pounds. Mr. L's. eyes are no better. 
This P. S. is for Mr. Erwin, if you will be kind enough to show 
it to him. 



MR. CLAY TO .* 

Ashland, July 14, 1835. 

Dear Sir, I received last night your favor of the 8th instant. Having experienced the constancy and fidelity of your 
friendly attachment to me, and entertaining a high opinion of 
your discretion and judgment, 1 shall answer it with all the 
frankness and freedom with which I would address any friend, 
on the interesting subject of the next Presidential election. 

After the result of the election of 1832, 1 have felt no desire to 
have my name again presented as a candidate, unless I was satisfied 
that it was the wish of a probable majority of the people of the 
United States. Under the influence of this feeling, far from encouraging any movements in my favor, I have, in several instances, dissuaded them from being made, when I was consulted. 
I have indeed sometimes thought, since that period, that a state 
of things might arise which would induce a majority of the people to turn their attention toward me ; but it has not occurred. 
It is possible that if the Whigs had manifested no inclination toward other candidates, and had thought proper to have adhered 
to me, such a state of things might have arisen. But the solicitude of other gentlemen, perhaps more entitled than I am to be 
chosen Chief Magistrate, and the discouragement of the use of 
my name, resulting from the issue of the last contest, have led 
respectable portions of the Whigs, in different States, to direct 
their views to other candidates than myself. The truth is that 
I was strongly disinclined to be presented as a candidate in 1832, 
fearing the issue which took place, but I was overruled by 
friends, some of whom have since thought it expedient, in consequence of that very event, that another name should be substituted for mine. 

Without meaning to pass my opinion upon the measure adopted by the Whig members of your Legislature, at the last winter 
session, except in regard to its operation upon the prospects of 

* The latter part of this letter, with its address, is lost. 

my election, I must say that I think it was highly injunous to 
those prospects. Ohio had been considered as a State which 
(Jackson out of the way) would certainly bestow her suffrage 
on me, if I were a candidate. It was believed, and probably is 
yet believed, that no candidate would miite so much strength in 
opposition to Mr. Van Buren as I could. When, therefore, it was 
seen that Ohio, instead of manifesting a disposition to support 
me, was disposed, through her Legislature, to bring forward 
another gentleman, it exhibited a division in our party, and a 
distrust of the extent of my strength which had an unfavorable 
effect on my pretensions. There were many too who could not 
see the policy or propriety of selecting, as a candidate, a gentleman who was an original friend of Jackson, in preference to all 
who had been uniform in opposition to him. The principle, on 
which such a selection was founded, looked too much to support 
expected to be derived from the Jackson ranks, without sufficiently estimating the amount that might be lost in our own from 
positive aversion, or apathy and indifference. 

I have never said that I would not consent, under any circumstances, to be a candidate. I have said that I did not wish to 
be a candidate, except on the condition before mentioned, that 
is, that I was desired by a probable majority of the country, or 
at least that there was strong reason to believe that I should not 
be again defeated. I could not have declared that my name 
should not be used, in any contingency, without violating a principle of public duty, which subjects the services of every citizen 
of the country to the call of the majority. But I have reserved 
to myself the right of controlling and arresting, as far as I could, 
any movement which might be attempted in my behalf that was 
likely to end in defeat. 

I must now, in frankness, say that the condition on which 1 
should be willing to be run has not heretofore existed, and does 
not seem to me now to exist. I have no reason to believe that 
I should be elected if I were brought forward ; none to think 
that I am the wish of the majority of the people. And it is repugnant to my feelings and sense of propriety to be voluntarily 
placed in an attitude in which I would seem to be importuning 
the public for an office which it is not willing to confer. It is 
possible indeed, as many of my friends think, and so I am inclined to believe from the information I possess, that, if I were 
the only Whig candidate in opposition to Mr. Van Buren, I would receive a greater support than any other; but I apprehend it 
would fall short of securing my election, 

I have appropriated too much of this letter to myself, the least 
important part of yoiu's. But I will now give you my candid 
views as to the state of the country and the best policy, as it 
seems to me, for the Whigs to pursue. 

I will not take up time in dwelling on the calamity of Mr. 
Van Buren's election. It is enough for me to express my conviction that it would lead to a system of general corruption, and 
end in a subversion of the Union. 

I feel too with you the absolute necessity to secure his defeat, of 
union and concert among those who are opposed to him. Can that 
union and concert be produced on Judge White ? I think not, 
for a reason already stated. He has been throughout a supporter 
of Jackson's administration, and holds no one principle (except 
in the matter of patronage) as to public measures in common 
with the Whigs. Although for other reasons he is to be preferred to Van Buren. I apprehend that it would be impossible, if 
we were to take him up as our candidate, to infuse among our 
friends the spirit and zeal necessary to insure success, especially 
in States where internal improvements and the American system have been popular. The Judge, however, seems to be the 
favorite of the South and South-west ; and, from all the lights 
which we possess, it is probable that he will obtain their undivided support. At least it is so probable as to make it a justifiable basis of future calculation. 

While Mr. Webster has attainments greatly superior to those 
of any other nominated candidate, it is to be regretted that a 
general persuasion seems to exist that he stands no chance. I 
believe that, if he stood a fair chance elsewhere, by great effort, 
the vote of this State might be given to him. In this opinion, 
however, I diiter from many of my friends. 

General Harrison could easier obtain the vote of Kentucky 
than any other candidate named. Judge McLean has not recently been much spoken of, was never generally popular here, 
but against Van Buren perhaps be might obtain the vote of Kentucky. ' . 
You will say this is not a very favorable account of the prospects of the several candidates opposed to Mr. Van Buren. It is 
not, and I regret it, but I believe it to be true. 

What then is to be done ? Nothing toward an union upon 
 

either of them by public assemblies, in my opinion, until after 
the election in Pennsylvania. Great confidence exists that the 
Jackson candidate for Governor there will be defeated, and as 
great that, in that event, the State will not support Mr. "Van 
Buren. Mr. Webster's friends. General Harrison's, and Judge 
M'Lean's, each persuade themselves that the vote of the State 
will be given to their favorite. Now, if we can have reasonable 
assurance that Pennsylvania will support either of them, I should 
think it would be our true policy to rally upon that one, and 
employ all our energies to give him as great an amount of support as possible. 

There would then be three candidates : Mr. Van Buren, Mr. 
White, and the Pennsylvania favorite. And if White gets the 
South and South-west vote, or nearly all of it, and Pennsylvania and the Whig States North of the Potomac, and in the West, 
including Louisiana, unite on a candidate, he would enter the 
House with the largest vote, and Van Buren might have the 
smallest vote of the three. 

I agree with you that whoever is returned to the House will 
be elected. If his plurality is considerable, after the experience 
which we have had, and upon general principles, it is desirable 
that he should be chosen. 

On a late occasion of a public dinner, given to Governor 
Poindexter, I avowed publicly my opinion in opposition to Mr. 
Van Buren. This I should not have done, but for the report 
that I favored his pretensions in a contest with Judge White, 
which was industriously circulated. You will see v/hat I said 
in the public papers. The truth is, that I think the election of 
either Mr. Van Bnren or Judge White would be a great misfortune, although that of the Judge would be the least. I did not 
express my preference between the other candidates, which it appeared to me improper to do. But I have no hesitation in saying to you that either Mr. Webster, General Harrison, or Judge 



LOUISA CAROLINE JEFFERY TO MR. CLAY. 

New Yoek, July 19, 1835. 

My dear Sir, Will you allow ''little insignificant me" (to 
parody Miss Kemble's words) to answer your last kind letter addressed to Miss Martineau ? She has received safely the difier
ent letters and newspapers you kindly forwarded to her, including the parcel transmitted through Sir Charles Vaughan. Since 
we left the Virginia Springs, we have made a very pleasant journey through the valley to Harper's Ferry, with Mr. and Mrs. 
William Sullivan of Boston, visiting tlie Natural Bridge and 
Weir's Cave by the way, which objects are greatly inferior to the 
Falls of Niagara and the Mammoth Cave, in interest. We have 
been spending a few days here, visiting Long and Staten Islands, 
and on Tuesday morning we go up the North River to West 
Point, Catskill, and probably to Saratoga; thence to Stockbridge, and after visiting some of the pretty New England villages, we shall go to Boston about the 14th of August. 

Miss M. received rather unfavorable accounts of the political 
state of England from her brother. He appears to think that 
the Tory influence (used in intimidating and bribing electors) 
will be too strong for the Whigs ; that they will not carry large 
enough measures to satisfy the people, and there will follow that 
dangerous state of things, pressui-e from without ; and to what 
is this Tory reaction to be attributed ? To the imbecility of the 
Whigs, I suppose the Radicals will say. I should rather attribute 
it to the fears of the timid, arising from the constant complaints 
of the Radicals since the passage of the Reform Bill, and the 
confidence these disputes inspired the Tories with, that they 
might rise through the want of union among their opponents. Did 
you see that Lord Stanley asserts, on the authority of a friend at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> (of course Mr. Murray), that Americans are all Conservative ? If by Conservative he means Tory, I think he 
would find himself mistaken, and I can not think Mr. Murray 
could mean to make such an assertion. You, in the great kindness of your heart, will excuse my want of talent to condense 
all my matter into one page. 

We feel very grateful for Judge Porter's kind regards and remembrances, and though passing through a very excellent channel, they might be still more welcome did they come more direct. When you write to him next, will you just mention that 
Miss M. and I sent him a joint packet, which we trust he received safely, though it was only directed, Attacapas, La. Give 
my very kind love to Mrs. Erwin ; tell her I trust she will pardon me for my neglect in not writing to her ere this, but she 
shall certainly have my impressions of Yankee land. 

I feel very grateful that my name is joined with my compan 

ion in the recollections of the kind and excellent inhabitants of 
Woodlands and Ashland. Some of my most pleasing associations are connected with my visit to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. I am fully 
aware I have no claim on your very valuable time, but if, in the 
exceeding benevolence of your heart, you put pen to paper and 
honor me with a few lines, to tell us how our very good friends 
are and something of their thoughts and feelings, I shall feel 
more grateful than any lady in whose album you have written, 
inasmuch as a few words from Mr. Clay's heart are worth pages 
of his handwriting, though that has its value. I do not give 
you so difficult a subject to treat on as " the compatibility of the 
Roman Catholic religion with freedom." 

We shall be much pleased to meet Mr. and Mrs. Smith. We 
are much grieved to hear of Mrs. Clay's continuous indisposition. 
Remember us most kindly to her, and our best love to the dear 
inhabitants of Woodlands ; and, with our united kind regards 
and grateful recollections to yourself, believe me yours, etc. 



JAMES BARBOUR TO MR. CLAY. 

Barbouesville, August 2, 1835. 
On the subject of politics, since our retrograde movement in 
April, in this State, I have desponded almost to despair. That 
our jugglers should succeed in seducing the people into a belief 
that it was premature to discuss the Presidential election, and 
that the issue should be Leigh, the bank, instruction, and all 
that kind of stuff, and the moment they had succeeded, turn 
right round, claim a Van Buren victory, send delegates to the 
Rump Convention, and immediately demand of their partisans 
implicit obedience and all this juggling to be acted in broad 
daylight, without producing an immediate and violent reaction, 
seems to me to render our scheme of self-government highly 
doubtful. Not having left my house scarcely since, personally I 
know but little. If there have been any changes in the State, 
as yet, I fear they are few. The Whigs seem generally to have 
determined to support White. A small accession from the 
Jackson ranks might give us the majority in the State, but the 
leaders of the latter have told their creatures that the Whigs are 
playing false ; they wish to divide the Jacksonians, so as to bring 
•he election into the House (of which they express a holy horror), with a view to elect Webster, yourself, or some other 
Whig. It is this which constitutes the most formidable obstacle 
to our success in this State. The running of three candidates 
they seize upon in confirmation of their charge, and it is this 
that alone gives them hopes of success here. For being apart 
from this weapon, and the endorsement of Jackson, would not 
obtain five hundred votes in the State. But I am quite satisfied 
that no candidate can succeed against him here, notwithstanding 
his unpMularity, unless it be one maintaining the favorite doctrine of the State, especially one who has been opposed, and is 
now opposed to the Bank. For independent of the long cherished hostility to that institution, since Jackson's hostility has 
been avowed, and his party acquiring success by their incessant 
clamor on that head, all those in pursuit of office, whatever may 
be their real opinions, have joined in the denunciation. Opposition, therefore, to this institution, is now a fixed maxim in the 
political creed of this State, as much so, as the undivided Godhead with a Mohammedan. White happens in this respect to 
stand well, and therefore I think is the strongest man that can 
be presented to Virginia. In addition to this, the slave question 
begins, as I learn, to excite a strong sensation among some of 
our people. Locality associates Van with the fanatics of his 
State, and it is not improbable will have a greater influence in 
the South, than any other circumstance in the contest. Webster is out of the question here ; McLean is not thought of ; 
Harrison, next to White, stands foremost I should conclude. It 
seems to me, however, on the whole, that we have no prospect 
of excluding Van, but by the plan you suggest of selecting two 
candidates that will be strongest in their respective sections. 
White, I apprehend for the South, Webster, for the East, North, 
and West, or whomsoever Pennsylvania prefers for in my 
view, she holds the election in her hands. By running two 
popular men, we have the prospect of retaining or acquiring the 
ascendency in the State Government, an object of great importance, and almost a compensation for the loss of our Presidential 
candidate. For example, even here, we hope, through White, 
of regaining our ascendency, where, with an inferior candidate, 
we should be in a decided minority. Fortunately in Pennsylvania, the division in the Jackson ranks promises success to the 
Whig candidate for Governor. If he succeed it will be sovereign 
in the contest for President. This election occurring in Octo 

ber will become a beacon to us in the difficulties with which 
we are surrounded. With its aid, the ensuing winter, you may 
decide upon the best course our affairs furnish. Hence, I threw 
cold water on Pleasant's proposed meeting in this State for this 
month, and it has been prudently abandoned. Personally dissatisfied with White, I will support him only because he is a 
lesser evil than Yan. I shall wait patiently the development of 
events, and be prepared to follow any course esteemed best to 
exclude Van. I read, and was much pleased with your remarks 
touching this gentleman, made at the Poindexter fete. 


MR. ERWIN TO MR. CLAY. DEATH OF MRS. ERWIN. 

The Woodlands, December 15, 1835. 

; My dear Sir, I feel myself scarcely equal to the task which 
my duty imposes, that of writing you at this time, and speaking 
of the late dreadful calamity with which it has pleased God to 
afflict us by which, at the same fatal blow, has been taken 
from you a daughter, miequaled in filial devotion and love, and 
from me a wife, the most devoted, kind, and virtuous, with which 
man was ever blessed. 

Other friends have, I learn, given you the particulars of this 
sad event, which will spare me the pain of presenting to you the 
heart-rending scene which was so unexpectedly produced by 
the hand of Providence. '^ 

My home, lately the happiest, which I have shared for years 
with a beloved wife, who returned my affection with a devotion 
almost unknown, who, whether I was worthy or not, honored 
me with a love and confidence which I would not have exchanged for the whole world beside, that home is now to me insupportable. Every object that presents itself each tree and * 
flower, once so dear when objects of her care now serve only 
to make known to me my loss and my misery. The beloved 
object who gave life and animation to all, has left me to lament 
over my wretched fate. 

You, my dear sir, I am fully sensible, can and will extend to 
me more sympathy than any other human being you who best 
knew her exalted worth, who have daily witnessed our happiness, not surpassed, I vainly believe, in the annals of wedded 
Hfe you who shared our pleasures and our joy, who bestowed 
upon me the choicest gift of heaven, can feel for me, but who, 

I fear, will require for yourself all the sympathy of your friends, 
and all the philosophy with which you are endowed, to support 
you under this sad bereavement. Mrs. Clay, although in reality 
scarcely able to support herself under this severe trial, has suppressed, as far as she was able, her own feelings, intent only 
in rendering to me and my dear children every kindness which 
her judgment and affection could suggest. She has abandoned 
her own home and remained with us, exerting herself to preserve 
the babe, which has cost us all so dear. 

My children, now ten-fold more dear to me than before, afford me much consolation, yet they are the objects of my greatest solicitude ; for me to remain here is impossible, and to part 
from any of them, at this moment, will be equally trying. IVIrs. 
Clay at once kindly proposed taking charge of all of them, and 
to have Miss Brulard remove to Ashland, for the present, and 
teach them as before. Miss B. wishes to return South, and the 
plan now is, to leave the three youngest at Ashland, the babe, 
with Lotty and a wet nurse, under Mrs. Clay's care, and for the 
two boys, Henry and James, to accompany me. 

I expect to leave for New Orleans two days hence. My boys 
will be important to me, and I shall take care not to let any feeling prevent their having the best means for their improvement 
afforded them. 

I shall hope to hear from you very soon after I reach New Orleans. ' 


GOVERNOR m'dUTFIE TO MR. CLAY. 

Abbeville, C. H., January 27, 1836. 

My dear Sir, I am from home, and you must excuse the 
foolscap on which I write. Perceiving the message relative to 
the French indemnity referred to your Committee, I am irresistibly compelled to make a suggestion or two. You again have it 
in your power for the third or fourth time, to save the country 
from a great calamity. It is perfectly obvious that if the Animal Message of December last had been permitted to reach 
France before any additional cause of irritation was given by the 
President, the indemnity would have been promptly paid by the 
French Executive. The king and the ministry have all along 
been most anxious to adjust the difficulty and pay the claim. 
They have had to struggle with a refractory Chamber, who have 
co-operated with General Jackson's weakness and folly to produce war. Now it seems to me that the course for Congress to 
pursue, for the interest and true honor of the country, is perfectly 
plain ; and that is, to be as courteous and civil as the President 
has been rude and insulting. State, what is evidently true, a 
confidence that there is a desire, on the part of the king and 
ministry, to adjust the matter without war, and a belief that they 
will pay the indemnity, when they read the annual Message, 
and that consequently no preparations for war are necessary. I 
have not a doubt that such a course would insure a peaceable 
and prompt adjustment of the existing differences. 

If war ensues. Congress must now be responsible. It will 
proceed from their acts, and not those of the President. Even 
his last Message would be nothing to France, if Congress would 
again adopt the course you recommended last year. If it should 
fail, there will still be time to prepare during the session for nonintercourse, for 1 can not believe a war possible. A non-intercourse act on our part would not, I am sure, lead to a declaration 
of war by France. They could not make it a ground of v/ar. 

I beg you, my dear Sir, to excuse this liberty. The magnitude of the interests involved must be my apology. A war with 
France would be utterly ruinous to the Southern States, and 
God knows what would be its effect upon public liberty. It 
would be the most signal example of the folly of nations the 
world ever witnessed. We go to war for five millions, which is 
sponged out by the declaration, and with a certainty that we 
shall lose ten times as much, and never can compel France to 
pay one cent. 


MISS JEFFERY TO MR. CLAY. 

Boston, March 10, 1S36. 
My dear Sir, I sail from New York on the 1st of April, in 
the packet ship Orpheus. Can I take any parcel or communication for you to your son or to Mrs. Henry Clay ? And will 
 

you favor me with a letter of introduction to the latter ? as I 
think she might be pleased to see in a foreign county, a person 
who had seen and known her own relations ; and though I am 
afraid I can do but very little to increase her pleasure, yet I 
should wish to show, at least, how very grateful I feel for all the 
kindness I have received from you and yours, by adding my 
mite if I can. Will you remember me to Mrs. Clay and assure 
her of my lively recollections of her kindness. I am afraid 
there is nothing in the world I can do for you ; but should you 
ever wish for any thing which I can procure in England, I shall 
be very much pleased to be employed. Remember me to Judge 
Porter. 



GEORGE TUCKER TO MR. CLAY. 

University of Virginia, June 30, 1836. 
My dear Sir,— Before you receive this you will have learned 
the death of our venerated friend, James Madison. I take the 
liberty of asking you to have the inclosed resolutions published 
in " The IntelUgencer," and I can not lose this opportunity of 
letting you know, or rather of giving you a further proof of the 
high place you held in his estimation. When I was last with him, 
a few days after the short interview I had with you in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, we were conversing on the aflairs of the nation and especially on the then agitating question of the efforts of the Abolitionists when, with that absence of his habitual reserve on 
political topics, of which he had of late afforded me many flattering proofs, he said, " Clay has been so successful in his compromising other disputes, I wish he could fall upon some plan 
of compromising this, and then all parties (or enough of all parties, I forget which) might unite and make him President." 
Knowing his desire to be at peace with all, and to escape the 
coarse and reckless vituperation of the newspapers, I never ventured to mention this except to one or two discreet friends, nor 
would I now do it to any one who would make it public, as in 
the virulence of party feeling, it would operate with many prejudiced minds to abate the respect that the nation will be disposed to show to his memory, and by thus detracting somewhat 
from the weight and influence of his good opinion, deprive you 
of your just rights. I never, however, intended that such a remark should be buried, as that would have been a still greater 

injustice to you, and meant, and still mean in good time to make 
it known. You see I write frankly, but I trust not at the expense of delicacy 

Would it be practicable, and if practicable, would it be safe 
and prudent to extend the franking privilege to Mrs. Mddison ? 
You can appreciate the real objections, if there be any, without 
being deterred from your views of right, by chimerical apprehensions. I pray you then to consider of it, if not too late, and 
act accordingly. 

I forwarded to you last year two copies of my discourse before our Philosophical Society one for yourself and the other 
for Miss Martineau. Did they reach you in time before she left 
you ? 

You must have a mixed feeling of triumph, contempt, and 
amusement, that the majority have been obliged, virtually, to 
pass your Land bill, under another form. 



HARRIET MARTINEAU TO MR. CLAY. 

New Yoke, July 26, 1836. 

Dear Sir, I am just about to sail for England, and I do not 
know where you are, but I can not help writing once more, to assure you of my respectful and affectionate remembrance ; and of 
the earnestness with which I shall always watch for tidings of 
you and yours. If you should ever chance to visit England, you 
will give my mother and me the pleasure of seeing you at " 17 
Pludyer St., Westminster ;" and if, in the mean time, I can be of 
any service to you whatever in furnishing information, or in 
any other way, pray write to me there ; and it will delight me 
to be of use to you. 

Pray remember me most kindly to Mrs. Clay and Mr. Erwin, 
and believe me ever yours faithfully and affectionately. 



MRS. MADISON TO MR. CLAY. 

MoNTPELER, November 8, 1836. 

The continued and very severe affection of my eyes, not permitting, but with much difliculty, even the signature of my 
name, has deferred, dear friend, the acknowledgments due for 
your very kind and acceptable letter of August 18th. I should 
sooner have resorted for this purpose to the pen of an amanuensis, but that the failure of my general health combining equal, 
and sometimes greater suffering, rendered dictation very painful, 
and hope still flattered me that I might yet use my own. So 
much time having elapsed with but little improvement in my 
situation, I can submit to no longer delay in offering this explanation of my silence, nor omit the expression of my deep sensibility to that pure and true sympathy which I am conscious I 
receive from such highly valued friends as Mrs. Clay and yourself. 

The sources of consolation in my bereavement which you 
suggest, are those wliich my heart can most truly appreciate. 
The reflected rays of his virtues still linger around me, and my 
mind now dwells with calmer feelings on their mellowed tints. 
He left me, too, a charge, dear and sacred, and deeply impressed 
with its value to his fame, and its usefulness to his country. The 
important trust sustained me under the heavy pressure of recent 
loss, and formed an oasis to the desert it created in my feelings. 

In fulfillment of his wishes I have, therefore, devoted myself 
to the object of having prepared for the press the productions 
of his own pen. It will form the surest evidence of his claim to 
the gratitude of his country and the world. With the aid of my 
brother, who had prepared copies of the debates in the Revolutionary Congress and in the Convention, under Mr. Madison's 
eye, triplicates have been completed for publication here and 
abroad. My son went, in July, as far as New York, and remained there for the purpose of negotiating with the most eminent publishers, and I have had communication with those in 
other cities, but no offer has been made by any entitled to confidence, which would free me from heavy and inconvenient pecuniary advances and the risk of impositions and eventual loss. 
Under these circumstances I have been advised by a friend to 
offer the work to the patronage of Congress, asking their aid so 
far as to relieve the work from the charges upon it, principally 
for literary and other benevolent purposes, and, after their use 
by Congress, to give me the stereotype plates. This would at 
once allow me to throw them into general circulation on a scale 
that would remunerate me more in accordance with the expectations entertained by their author, and would also allow the price 
to be so graduated as to insure their general diffusion. 

As this plan was suggested by one favorable to the Adminis
tratioii, he advised also that the channel of his friends, as the majority of those who were to decide on the proposition, should 
be employed in making it, and pledged their support. This 
work being a record only of what passed preceding the existence 
of present parties, can not associate the name of Mr. Madison 
with either, and therefore its introduction and advocacy by the 
one can be no bar to the favor of the other. On your part, I am 
sure that, in my yielding to it this direction, you will perceive 
no deviation from the high respect and friendly regard I entertain toward yourself, but approving an adoption of this course as 
most conducive to success, you will, with your friends, insure it 
on the merits of the work alone, uninfluenced by adversary feeling toward the source from whence the measures originated. 

It was my intention to have gone to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, principally 
with a view to obtain in personal conference the advice of my 
best friends, but my protracted ill health, and the approach of an 
inclement season I fear may prevent the journey. 

In addition to three volumes of the Debates (near six hundred 
pages each) now ready for the press, matter enough for another 
volume is expected, and nearly four hundred pages copied, of 
writings and letters on Constitutional subjects, considerable selections have also been made from his early correspondence, which 
may form a volume on the legislative proceedings of Virginia, 
and historical letters of the period from 1780 up to the commencement of the new Government. His Congressional and 
Executive career may furnish two more. His vmtings already 
in print, as " Political Observations," a pamphlet in 1795, " Examinations of the British Doctrine," etc., it is thought should be 
embodied with his other works for more permanent preservation. 

It is important that these manuscripts should be prepared and 
committed to the press as early as they can follow the Debates, 
and the success of the latter will much facilitate the publication 
of the former, even if Congress should decline a like patronage 
to them, a mode which would be much preferred. 

The near approach of the time which will call you to your 
Senatorial duties rendering it uncertain whether this would reach 
you ere your departure from home, I deem it safest to address it 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, whence I hope, on your safe anival, you will 
favor me with an acknowledgment of its receipt and any suggestions your friendship may offer. 

Accept for Mrs. Clay and yourself my affectionate respects. 



SIR WILLIAM CLAY TO MR. CLAY. 

FuLWELL Lodge, Twickenham, January 12, 1837. 

Dear Sir, My friend and brother-in-law, Mr. Temple Bowdoin, tells me that he has the honor of your acquaintance, and 

that he has mentioned to yon my name. I am tempted, in consequence, to take the liberty of sending you a pamphlet I have 
recently published, which may not be wholly without interest 
to you, as it relates to a question of great interest, as well in the 
United States as in England ; and as I have endeavored to avail 
myself of the ample experience which your legislative bodies 
have had the opportunities to acquire, I trust that, by accepting 
this trifling work, you will permit me to consider myself not 
wholly a stranger to one who has conferred such celebrity on 
the name I bear. It is, indeed, not wholly impossible that I 
may have some claim to the honor of your acquaintance beyond 
the mere similarity of name. My lineal ancestor was related to 
Penn. I am not quite clear that some one of our name did not 
accompany him ; but it is certain that at a somewhat later period 
(eighty or one hundred years since), a member of our family 
did settle in America, although his friends never had any record 
of his subsequent fortunes. 


CHANCELLOR KENT TO MR. CLAY. 

New Yoek, February 20, 1837. 
My dear Sir, I hope I shall not be deemed too obtrusive, but I 
can not refrain from declaring my admiration of the speech delivered by you, in the Senate, in January last, on the expunging resolution, and which is published at large in " The National Intelligencer" of the 16th inst. My sympathies, and judgment, and confidence, and patriotism, and grief, and indignation, are with you 
in every point, and if I was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, I would go directly 
up to you, and give your hand the hearty shake of sympathetic 
feeling. You have vindicated the resolution of 1834 with irresistible force, and damned the other to everlasting fame. If you, 
and such men as you, who are storming despotic and servile 
meanness in the Senatorial Hall, have no other recompense, it 
may possibly give you some consolation to be assured that you 
are receiving the silent admiration and gratitude of thousands, 
and by none with more hearty pulsation than by your most respectful and obedient servant. 


MR. FOX TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, March 8, 1837. 

Dear Sir, I have to draw upon England for some money, 
by the next packet, of the 16th. If you can make it convenient, consequently, to draw upon me a draft for the $1,180 
which I am in your debt, at ten days date from the present, I 
shall be much obliged to you to allow me to settle it in that 
way. If agreeable to you, the draft can be sent to me for acceptance, at that date, before your departure ; or you can inform 
me in whose hands you leave it. My servant, the bearer of 
this, will wait for an answer, or call for one early in the morning, as you may desire. 
 

I wish you a very happy journey, and am extremely glad to 
find that we are to enjoy the pleasure of your society in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> during another session of Congress. 



HARRIET MARTINEAU TO MR. CLAY. 

Westminstek, May 15, 1837. 

Dear Mr. Clay, It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge, 
on behalf of many authors, besides myself, your exertions on the 
copyright business. I thought I was sure, both of what your 
convictions and your efforts would be ; and I rejoice that my 
confidence has been justified. We are exceedingly pleased with 
your Report, and have strong hope that our object may be attained next session. The American newspapers seem to show 
a more and more favorable disposition toward our claim, and 
some solid proofs have reached the hands of one, at least, of our 
authors (Professor Lyell), of the feeling v/hich honorable American publishers entertain of the injury we suffer. Several hundreds of copies of Lyell's fifth edition of his Geology, in four 
volumes, have been ordered from England by booksellers in 
Boston, New York, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and the money, in full, 
transmitted with the order. A highly creditable proceeding. It 
was transacted through Professor Silliman. 

Have you seen what my New York publishers (who are English) have been doing to obviate mutilation of my book? We 
fear we must submit to be pirated, but the risk of mutilation is 
much lessened by the work being divided into parts. The book 
has been published here only four days. I have had little hope of 
pleasing any body in either country with my work. I might 
have done so by merely copying my journal, but I felt the occasion to be too serious a one to be trifled with, and I have, accordingly, risked every thing by making an open avowal of 
principles which have no chance of being popular. I am very 
easy now the thing is done. My conscience is discharged, and 
I really do not care much what becomes of me in name and fortune, while I can not live without freedom of speech. This 
last can never, now, be taken from me. 

Your new President seems to have succeeded in making himself gloriously unpopular at the very outset. I do not believe 
m his power of retrieving himself. We shall see. I hope you 
will never have another President who will venture to declare, 
on entering upon office, that under no circumstances will he, on 
a particular point, assent to a constitutional act which may become the will of the nation. Enough of him. 

We are in a critical state, and the Tories may, very likely, 
have another short term of office. The weakness of the sovereign, the incompleteness of the Reform Bill, and the difficulties 
thereby left in the way of the representation, are too much for 
the present ministry, even without the House of Lords, which 
we have pour comhle de maux. We do not fear breach of the 
peace, but much poHtical struggle. We shall have your good 
wishes on the liberal side, though you do find our Tory ministers 
so very civil to the United States. 

I hope you are well, and in some good degree reconciled and 
content in mind. My mother and I are in the best health and 
spirits, and talking more, it seems to me, of my beloved American friends than of all other persons in the world. 

With my kind respects to Mrs. Clay and Mr. Erwin, I am, 
dear sir, yours affectionately. 


WILLIS HALL TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, December 14, 1838. 
Dear Sir, I rejoice to learn from the papers that you have 
arrived safe and in good health and cheerful spirits, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. The accident you met with on your journey gave us much 
concern. You might have said, perhaps, on the occasion as Csbsar said to the boatman, " Quid times ? CcBsarem invehis V 
I believe most implicitly in your fortunes indeed, the great 
source at once of my anxiety for your health and of my confidence in your preservation is the confirmed belief that our Union 
and the future happy destinies of our country are bound up in 
your life. Yet the most devout believers do not disdain a little 

worldly prudence. Cromwell charged his soldiers to " Trust in 
Pj-ovidence, but keep their powder dry !" In the same spirit I 
would urge you to take care of yourself. Your country never 
stood in so great need of you. 


HARRISON GRAY OTIS TO MR. CLAY. 

Boston, December 24, 1838. 

My DEAR Sir, I duly received your last favor with its inclosure, which is indeed a curiosity, which I will keep on file subject to your order. I ventured to give the substance of it to a 
Senator of this State, the late Lieutenant-Governor Armstrong, 
a very worthy and orthodox gentleman who believes that original depravity comprehends political as well as what is more strictly 
moral, and accounts this as a mere variety among innumerable instances. Of late " The Atlas" has been silent on a certain topic, but 
whether this be preliminary to a new outbreak, a few days will 
determine. I can not yet find that the parties concerned in the 
project comprehend any persons hereabout, beyond a petit comits 
who are supposed to command the back stairs of that press. But 
I suspect there must be others, and that there is some overt communion with " The American," etc., in New York. We shall see. 
Mr. Webster does not leave Boston, as I hear, until the meeting 
of the Legislature or about that time, January 1st. Whether he 
has any object in the delay, beyond his own convenience, I can 
not say. A rumor has prevailed of his intention to decline a reelection, but of this I have no convincing evidence. I think 
there is a disposition among tUe Whigs here to speak plainly, and 
as you would approve, on a certain subject. But until he unequivocally withdraws from the canvass you can easily see that 
they must feel under restraint. The most to be hoped prior to 
that event, is a declaration by the Legislature adhering to him 
as their first choice, and announcing yourself as the second. 
Some pains will be taken to affect this, and I must at present 
think with success. But neither my information nor influence 
are of the value that was attached to them, in " the days when 
I was young." I have also been housed for three weeks with 
the " unpleasant pains which infest the toe," but I hope to be 
on my legs to-morrow, otherwise I can do nothing, unless, like 
poor Judge B., I drive into the public offices. You are aware of 
the disturbing causes which are every where at work to pollute 
the political current, and of the address with which antagonist 
causes are too often made to co-operate in the same result. AntiMasonry I consider as effete in itself. There is no longer zeal 
among its votaries. The mission from this State was an absolute burlesque. Still it will furnish pretenses for paragraphs and 
cabals. I have more fear in regard of abolition. The danger 
is that the Whigs will identify themselves, at least in appearance, 
with the Abolitionists, and thus souse themselves into their toils. 
This will be folly and madness without excuse. So deeply impressed am I with an opinion of the extreme infatuation of this 
officiousness that I am reconciled to Atherton's resolutions, at 
the avowal of which some of my friends appear to be horrified ; 
but they forgive me as an old gentleman whose vagaries do no 
harm. By the by, I have been told that one of the '^ representatives" alluded to in H n's letter is Mr. C g, of this State, 

now in Congress. 

I began this merely as an acknowledgment of yours and have 
rambled on. When any thing occurs that I think may be gratifying to know I v/ill take leave to apprize you of it, and though at 
seventy-three I have little reason to calculate upon seeing you at 
the head of the nation, the hope of it is not among the least of 
my septuagenarian comforts. 

I am very faithfully and respectfully, dear sir, yours, etc. 



HARRISON GRAY OTIS TO MR. CLAY. 

Boston, January 11, 1839. 

My dear Sir, ^Your friend Constans seems, for the present at 
least, to have blown his blast. I hope you may have continued 
to think well of the last letters, as I confess that I jump in judgment with the writer. It is evident, I think, however, that he 
writes under restraint, and plays with an oblique stroke, but he 
should drive the two balls (" ebony and topaz") into the same 
pocket. 

I have conversed with a very respectable and intelligent member of the Massachusetts Senate, who, having taken some pains 
to sound opinions, reports to me that he can not find an individual who approves of the freak of " The Atlas." I know, also, 
that the editor of " The Courier," and I believe, that the editors 
of all the Whig papers here, are equally opposed to the doctrines 
of that journal. Still there is an under-current somewhere. Mr. 
W. has again disclaimed his privity to or approbation of " The 
Atlas" heresy, and said he thought it unlucky. 

But I am satisfied he does not wish that the Legislature should 
move on the line of operation pointed out by Constans ^I'epeating their quondam opinions. I can't say that he would advise to 
any action on the subject. Probably he thinks best to do nothing. 
I also apprehend that he thinks you did him ill offices by favoring H., at his expense, in 1836, and that you would still promote 
his (H.'s) interest next to your own. You will judge whether 
it is worth while to attempt, through friends, to have any tclaircissement on that point, I am also certain that he has no idea at 
present of saying nolo episcopari, though it seems unimaginable 
that he expects any important support. My opinions are not 
gathered from a personal interview with him, otherwise I would 
not feel at liberty to express them. I have met him but once 
since his return in summer. Nor do I violate any confidence in 
giving you these opinions ; but they are well founded. You 
can easily see that individuals, knowing this to be his way of 
thinking, may feel embarrassed in taking a step which, though 
not intended to be adverse to him, might be so construed ,• and 
that the consequence may be a suppression of further action by 
the Legislature. As yet, however, it is impossible to judge ; but 
that any effort will be made to nominate H. I do not believe, 
though it has been probably intended by the petit comite. 

Wednesday is assigned for choice of Senator. Mr. W. will 
be nominated at his own request, and will, doubtless, be chosen. 
Rumors were afloat of his intention to abdicate, and the Government was preparing to cut in. I am " confoundedly" afraid he 
will be cut out next year, and that this State will be lost. The 
disturbing causes are inauspicious. The last Legislature passed 
an absm'd act prohibitory of selling spirits in quantities less than 
fifteen gallons. Now petitions are presented for a repeal. I 
have been dragged into heading one, which is followed up with 
five thousand names ; though I have fought shy for many long 
years of all efforts to bring me out as an actor in the political 
scene, yet this strikes me as a monstrous abomination, and I 
yielded to urgent solicitations to become bell-wether. I still 
doubt the law will not be repealed ; and if not, it will be a fulcrum 
by which the Whig party will be capsized. The " rogues in 
spirit" will combine with the " rogues in grain." 

Then, again, there will be abolition. Our people, I fear, will 
not be silent. It is clear that the efforts of the Administration 
are directed fo the identifying Whiggism and Abolitionism, and 
the Whig party has not sense enough to keep free from the coils 
of the black snake. Your old Ghent colleague, though a person 
of extraordinary talents, and, as I believe, of great merit as a 
private citizen, is, I think, a variety per se in the human family. 
But as my old friend (and General <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>'s old friend), 
Mrs. Powel, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, used to say, when puzzled by any 
oddity or anomaly of character : " Why, my dear, you know God 
Almighty makes all sorts of men, women, and children." 

I have not shown H.'s letter since your last, nor shall I but 
with great discretion perhaps not at all, but only state the substance of the extract to two or three friends. 

I send you " The Atlas" of to-day ; it is triple brass. Think 
of the extract of his letter to you in a parallel column " Think 
of that Master Brooke." I doubt I could print them in a handbill, and clear one of Nick's bank shares. But I suppose you 
are right in your forbearance, though my mouth waters for such 
a hon hon. 

I express no sentiments to you that I should hesitate to avow 
any where, time and place fitting, yet do not wish to be " talked 
about ;" and I know you will govern yourself accordingly. 
 


C. HAMJVIOND TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, January 21, 1840. 

Dear Clay, Ever since the determination of the Harrisburg 
Convention was known, I have been watching for a httle abatement of decrepitude, that I might address you a letter of congratulation, in my own hand. I have now attempted it. 

I do think that you have great reason to be thankful that the 
burden of being a candidate for the Presidency was not put upon 
you. In my view the canvass was always full of degradation, 
and I think that now-a-days its humiliation is greatly increased. 
Since the categories of Sherrod Williams set the precedent, 
every one claims to question the candidate of his life, opinions, 
and general conduct. An indecent impudence marks the movements of his friends ; the foulest and often most painful imputations characterize the assaults of opponents. A man has to give 
up his own self-respect, or every hour give offense to some pedagogue that stands over him with uplifted rod. From such a 
condition I would ask that all high-minded men may be delivered, and I would earnestly condole with every friend made 
subject to it by the imperious call of the country. And, after 
all, what is the station when attained ? Just that in which no 
upright, independent man can feel himself at ease, or hold his 
own assurance that he makes his own opinions the basis of his 
public acts. I pray you take no exception to an instance I shall 
cite. 

J. Q,. Adams, in November last, wrote a strong letter on the 
Amistad case. How widely does it vary, in its positions of public law, from those urged upon the British Government by the Department of State, respecting slaves escaping to Canada, when 

Mr. Adams was President of the United States! Thus must the 
man be lost in the office. At best, it requires a good scribe and an easily controlled docility. 

The place you now hold has ever appeared of the highest 
honor to me, when held as you hold it, in ample confidence with 
your constituents. A Senator is the adviser and the trier of the 
President ; a Senator, thoroughly informed of public affairs, endowed with high powers of elocution, braced with nerve for 
every exigency, possessed of a competent estate, and deep in the 
confidence of his State, is just the man I could once have so far 
envied as to wish that what he had in enjoyment could be some 
day within my reach. 

I congratulate you and the country that you are a Senator, 
and I hope you will not lightly give up the place. Every thing 
we see or hear, or attempt to understand, points to approaching 
exigences, in which the country must call you to the rescue. 


MR. rOX (BRITISH MINISTER) TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, July 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1810">1810</a>, 

Dear Sir, ^I believe it will be more correct that I should 
wait to see what Congress will do, before I give away any of 
 

the copies sent to me of the British Commissioner's Report. 1 
shall then, I hope, be able to send it to you, either by Mr. Crittenden, or some other of your friends in Congress who may be 
returning at the close of the session to your State, and whom 
I can request to take charge of it. 

I inclose the draft accepted at thirty days, which I will provide duly for the settlement of at the office of the United States 
Bank here. With high respect, yours very faithfully. 



JUDGE (henry) BALDWIN TO MR. CLAY. 

1840. 

My dear Sir, I have this moment come from Bamford's 
through the rain. The first thing I read was a paper containing your remarks on Gallatin's pamphlet. It is, in the language 
of Scripture, health to my soul, and marrow to my bones. It is, 
as we say in Pennsylvania of apple-toddy meat, drink, washing, and lodging. Here is a token from one who always 
respected you as his old speaker, and schoolmaster in politics, 
elections, and candidates non obsta?iti and who in times of 
the highest excitement, never said of you as a statesman, a 
harsher thing than is in the pamphlet he put into your hands. 

(Any thing connected with the pending election, to the contrary notwithstanding, which has nothing to do with the personal accounts of H. B. and H. C.) 

Here is a drop of the honest stuff genuine Pennsylvania, 
the true extract, the essence of the American system, the produce of the same soil which gave us birth, and whence we derive our bread. It will suit an American palate, and raise no 
conscientious, constitutional scruples in an American stomach. 
Take a drop of it to my health in memory of Auld Lang Syne. 

This Florida case is a tough one. I shall have three or four 
evenings of leisure. When you, Creighton, Yance, and Ewing 
are disposed to bury old grudges, let me know it. Mrs. Bamford 
has a small moiety of the self same, and you will all be as welcome as the flowers of May. 

This is for your eye and those named, but for no others. 


GENERAL HARRISON TO MR. CLAY. 

NORTH Bend, N'ovember 15, 1840. 

My dear Sir, I shall set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, in the mail boat, 
to-morrow. I have written to Mr. C. Wickliffe (with whom 1 
have the business which takes me to Kentucky), to meet me in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=frankfort" rel="city">Frankfort</a> (having understood that he has removed to Bardstown). 

Since my letter to you, I have thought that our personal 
meeting might give rise to speculations, and even jealousies, 
which it might be well to avoid ; for, although I have made up 
my mind to disregard things of that sort when they are unavoidable, yet, as all the objects to be answered by our seeing 
each other might be accomplished through a mutual friend or 
friends, I submit to you whether it would not be better to adopt 
this mode of communication. If you think so, I request you to 
name to me the friend, as heretofore, to whom I may communicate my views upon a certain important action of mine, and receive yours in return. Upon the subject to which I allude, I 
assure you I have had no sort of communication with any one, 
unless it be important suggestions by unknown individuals (with 
but one exception. I refer to two letters written by a man whom 
I know, suggesting a general principle). I inclose this to Mr. 
Crittenden. I shall stay but one day in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, if I can get 
away. 


PETER B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

Saratoga Springs, January 28, 1841. 

Dear Sir, I was met, on my arrival here, by a confidential 
communication, through my nephew, the Speaker, from Mr. 
W(qedj who expressed some delicacy about broaching the subject of it to me personally, but hoped and intended to have a 
conference with me (as he had) before I left Albany. The subject was the contemplated appointment of Mr. Curtis as Collector of the Customs in New York, and the following was the 
purport of the communication. 

That the Governor and. his friends are extremely anxious for 
the appointment of Mr. Curtis, who, although not personally 
popular, is represented as possessing an extraordinary share of 
tact or stratagem ; and as being able, by his skill in planning 
and combining, and his untiring industry in executing, to produce the most astonishing political results. That, with the office 
of Collector (which he considers as second only in influence to 
that of Postmaster -General) he could, on all important occasions, 
command the vote of the city of New York, and, par constquence, of the State. That he is the intimate friend of^Mr. 
Webster, and possesses such influence over him as to be able to 
direct all his important political movements, an instance of which 
was shown in his withdrawing Mr. Webster's name from the hst 
of Presidential candidates without his knowledge or consultation 
with him, because he was fully satisfied that Mr. Webster could 
not then, as he now is, that he never can be elected to that office; 
and (although it might be disheartening and injurious to tell him 
so at this time) that he must not and will not be a candidate for 
the next term. That he (Mr. Curtis) has great respect for your 
political character, and opposed your nomination only because 
he was convinced that if you had been nominated you could not 
have been elected ; that, your position being altered, you are 
now the only prominent candidate of the Whig party for the 
next term, and can not fail of success, unless some most unexpected event should interpose to prevent it. That he (Curtis) is 
so strongly fortified in his apphcation for the Collectorship, that 
he thinks nothing can defeat it. AUliough he would feel much 
gratification in having your good wishes, and finally, that they 
(Mr. Weed and the Governor) had oftered these suggestions to 
me under the belief that I enjoyed your confidence ; and with 
the hope that your views in regard to Mr. Curtis may accord with 
those above expressed. 

My reply to Mr. Weed was, in substance, that I knew but 
little of .what was passing at the seat of Government, and was 
ignorant of your views, and more so of those of General Harrison, on the subject of the principal official appointments ; that I 
knew, as indeed your recent movements had proved, that you 
were extremely anxious to retire from the turmoil of politics, and 
have as little to do with the operations of the Government as 
would be consistent with your duties as a citizen ; but that, at 
the same time, it was characteristic of you not to withhold your 
opinions, if they should be asked, on subjects involving the interests of the country. I told him too, that I thought it would 
be presuming too much to expect you to interfere in behalf of 
Mr. Curtis, v/ith a full knowledge, which you must be presumed 
to possess, of the industry and zeal he had displayed in defeating 
your nomination, and that too in a total disregard of the known 
wishes of a large majority of the Whigs of this State. Still, 
however, that it was proper you should know what were the 
opinions of the Governor and his friends, in relation to Mr. Curtis, and that I would mention the subject in my next letter to 
you. 

Now I do not doubt that Mr. Curtis is a man of rare address 
and management ; nor that he wields the power over Mr. Webster's volitions that is claimed for him : nor that he will exert that 
power, and probably with success, in preventing his (Mr. Webster's) being a candidate at the next election : nor that it is his 
present wish and intention (especially if you should favor his 
views) to support you. And I have as little doubt that if he 
succeeds in obtaining the office, its patronage will be disposed in 
favors to his particular political friends. 

On the preceding facts, which I thought it my duty to communicate to you, I shall express no opinion, for surely no one is 
better able than yourself to weigh and decide on the various 
considerations which grow out of them. 

29 

As I believe I have given you quite matter enough for one 
dispatch, I will stop here at the end of my sheet, and probably 
write you again, some few days hence, from Albany. 

I am, as always, with great respect and regard, your obedien* 
servant. 



PETER B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

Niagara Falls, February 20, 1841. 

Dear Sir, I have received your favor of the Tth.instanv, 
and am not surprised at the feeling it manifests in regard to the 
conduct of the gentleman in New York, who has ventured to 
put forth such bold views and opinions in relation to his friend, 
Mr. Webster, nor at the wish you express that this conduct 
should be made known to the latter gentleman. 

But I feel that I can not, and ought not, to consent to have 
such communication made by or through me, for various reasons, 
one of which, and that decisive, is, that the matters mentioned 
in my letter were imparted to me in strict confidence, and under 
such injunctions of secresy as would forbid their going abroad, 
most especially in that particular direction. Another reason is, 
that, although I had a conversation with Mr. Weed, predicated 
entirely on the facts communicated by him through my nephew, 
I can not now be positive whether the whole of these facts were 
distinctly stated by both, or by one, and which of them, only. 

As you may not have correctly understood that part of my 
nephew's communication, I will now state it a little more at large. 

Mr. Curtis was made to say that Mr. Webster was a great 
and ambitious man ; that his affections had been_long set upon 
the Presidency ; that he had recently been quite unfortunate in 
his private pecuniary speculations, and repeated disappointments 
in these had already given a dyspeptic or hypochondriacal hue 
to his mind and feelings ; and that his friends were afraid that he 
might fall into the indulgence of habits which such a state of despondency is too liable to produce, and would prove ruinous to him ; 
that it was, therefore, incumbent on them to treat him with 
great delicacy, and rather to encoui'age than to thwart him in 
his ambitious aspirations ; and that it was under such views of 
Mr. Webster's situation that Mr. Curtis thought it inexpedient 
to disclose to him, at present, his real opinion in regard to Mr. 
Webster's future prospects for the Presidency. 
 

p. B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

Niagara Falls, February 20, 1841. 

Dear Sir, I wrote you from Albany, a few days since, on 
the subject of a National Bank, to be owned by the several 
States in their corporate capacities ; the capital to be raised on 
a pledge by each State of its interest, or the proceeds of it, in 
the national domain, guaranteed by the credit of the general 
Government, which would at once insure the realization of any 
desired amount ; the power of organizing and directing the 
operations of the institution to be divided between and exercised 
by the general Government and the several States, upon the 
great principle of separate and yet combined and harmonious 
powers now exercised in relation to other great interests. 




COL. W. HAMPTON TO MR. CLAY. 

Millwood, August 20, 1841, 

My dear Sir, Your favor of the 11th instant did not reach 
me until last evening ; inclosed you will receive my acceptance 
of the bill of exchange you sent me, which I have stipulated 
to pay, at Messrs. Goodhue & Co., my agents in New York. 

You will, I hope, decide upon taking Sovereign. He will, I 
 

think, suit your countrymen, better than Monarch, being much 
more showy, and is also a horse, in a very high form. 

We are anxiously expecting to hear the fate of the Bank bill. 
Should the President return it with his veto, I for one, shall 
despair for the Republic ; if our friends betray us, what can we 
expect from our opponents ? 


MARTIN VAN BUREN TO SIR. CLAY. 

Hills of Santee, March 26, 1842. 

My DEAR Sir, I have had the pleasure to receive your friendly letter at this place, and thank you very kindly for the invitation it contains. It is not quite certain that I will be able to stay 
long enough in Kentucky to pay Mrs. Clay and yourself a visit ; but if it should be so, you may rest assured that I shall not deny myself that gratification. My movements, after leaving Tennessee, are not definitively settled, and will have to be governed by circumstances, of which I am not now fully advised. It will not, however, in any event, be in my power to* be with you before the beginning of May. 
 

CARTER BEVERLY TO MR. CLAY. 

Fredericksburg, Va., April 2, 1842. 

Dear Sir, On my arrival here yesterday I received your 
reply to my letter of February last from Middlesex, and feel glad 
to find that the communication I then made to you was well 
received, and kindly acknowledged. 

It is assuredly a matter of high satisfaction to me to believe 
that I discharged the obligation, which feeling and duty dictated, 
in doing the justice I designed of effacing the indignity cast 
upon you by the unfortunate, and to me unhappy Fayetteville 
letter that was, and has been so much the subject of injury to 
you in the public mind. It is now, I trust, put entirely to rest 
in the minds of all honorable and candid men, of whatever political persuasion; for surely none can, or will henceforward 
presume to countenance the miserable slander that went forth in 
that communication to the public against you. The entire revocation of it given by me ought to overwhelm Ihe author of it 
with utter shame and mortification ; and if I had any right to 
say, were I in his situation, it would be my province, as it should 
be an incumbent duty on me, to make every atonement possible 
for such an unfounded, unprovoked attack upon your integrity 
and public fame. 

Believing that your letter to me, and this my reply, are calculated to benefit you in the public mind, I have sent both to 
" The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Whig" and " Independent" for publication. 

I reiterate expressions of health and happiness to you, and remain yours, etc. 


LORD ASHBURTON TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, April 11, 1842. 

Mt dear Sir, I am truly obliged to you for your very agreeable proposal. I should have taken the liberty myself of expressing a hope of being permitted to have a little conversation 
with you, and to renew our acquaintance, before you execute 
your purpose, which I, in common with your countrymen, so 
much regret, of retiring from this seat of Government. At a 
time of life which calls me more imperatively to give up all 
thoughts of public business, I have been tempted to make my 
appearance among you, to see if we can not contrive to live on 
more friendly terms, and to end bickerings between two countries which have, in truth, a sincere respect and affection for 
each other. Your good wishes for the success of this attempt 
are most acceptable to me. I only wish we had to treat together 
on what would soon cease to be material difficulties. 

I should take the earliest time you propose for the pleasure of 
seeing you, if it were not that I have an appointment, this morning, at your Foreign Department, and do not know exactly how 
long it may last. To-morrow I am at your service, as soon as 
you please after ten o'clock ; or I would call upon you, if it 
were more convenient to you. 



WILLIAM C. PRESTON TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, June 39, 1842. 

My dear Sir, I have dispatched your letter to General 
Thompson in the Mexican bag, and am glad to have even so 
small a commission to perform for you. 
 
The British negotiation, I believe, goes on smoothly in regard 
to every point except the Maine boundary, which is complicated 
and embarrassed by the multitude of diplomatists congregated 
upon it. They have been here ten days, and have not yet got 
to a proposition for discussion. Our hope is that Abbott Lawrence and Governor Kent will get the ascendency, and carry on 
the matter. The other points all of them, I think are in a 
train of very favorable adjustment. In the mean time, our internal condition is worse and worse, our separation from the 
Executive wider and wider, and the general confusion worse 
confounded. The election of Mangum has brought on a war 
ad intercessiotiem, and it is now generally believed (on good 
ground, perhaps) that there is a negotiation on foot to bring in 
the Locofocos to the Cabinet. Marcy and Stevenson, it is said, 
are the only two that lend a favorable ear, and they would 
have a rough navigation through the Senate. 

Mr. Rives' speech, yesterday, seemed to be a new latitude 
and departure. He abused your distribution policy, from beginning to end, in good set terms, and with much reason, I must 
say. He barely stopped short of denouncing it as unconstitutional ab initio, and has thus retraced his own steps. 

My letter was broken off by the intelligence of poor Southard's death. His funeral took place yesterday. To-day Tyler 
sends in his veto of the tariff. This is downright madness. 
God preserve us, for our condition is most sad. 



A LADY TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, July 13, 1842. 
To THE Hon. Henry Clay, The life of a political man, especially if he be pre-eminent among his cotemporaries, must, almost 
unavoidably, in an age of party strife, be one of great admixture 
of light and shade of exulting joy and vexatious incidents 
of injured feelings and of gratified pride. You, honored sir, 
have doubtless realized, more or less, the truth of these remarks 
in your own political career ; a career too brilliant to escape envy 
— too patriotic to escape detraction too fearless to escape opposition too upright and honest to escape the contumely and bitter hate of those who love power more than justice, falsehood 
more than truth, and who would sacrifice to t!ie Shibboleth of 

party the best interests of their common country. This may 
pass as a shade, but is it not more than balanced by the halo of 
light which arises from the approbation of the wisest statesmen, 
the honest praise of all true patriots, and the admiration of all 
Americans, in every condition of life, who respect honesty of 
purpose and integrity of principle ; who approve not ruinous experiments and insulting vetoes ; and who regard the welfare of 
their country as paramount to all other considerations ? Then 
comes the self-approving conscience. Yes, sir ; yes, bright and 
satisfactory most be to you the reminiscences of your public life. 

" All honor to the star of the West !" I trust it will not long 
be permitted to revolve in its distant orbit ; I trust it will not 
soon be permitted to set ; but may He who rules over all yet 
cause it to rise to our political zenith, and dispel the cloud of 
darkness which hangs over our once prosperous and happy, but 
now debased and injured country ; and by its genial influence 
and mighty power restore it to its former glorious and proud condition. 

Ladies, excluded by law from a voice in the counsels of the 
nation, have consequently no political influence. It is right that 
it should be so. Their duties lie in a difl'erent direction, and 
their happiness is drawn from a diflerent source. But ladies are 
not excluded from feeling a deep interest in the welfare of their 
country, and no law, and no physical incapacity, imaginary or 
real, prevents them from rendering it service by calling upon 
Him who overrules its destinies, to look down upon it in this its 
hour of darkness with pity and compassion, and to deliver it from 
its evil state. This is a canvassing which surely can be disapproved by none, and which compromises neither sex nor station. 
On this great source, then, of power and mercy, do I rely ; and 
daily do I offer up my supplications that God will open the eyes 
of this great nation of freemen to their true interests, and in 
good time cause them to place the Government in the hands of 
one to whom all anxious eyes and honest hearts are now turned 
— one who will not " follow in the steps of his illustrious predecessors ;" but who shall rule in wisdom and in judgment, thereby restoring a distracted, prostrated country to sanity and health. 
Nor do my fervent petitions end here. After a long life of 
honor, fame, and usefulness shall have ended, may he leaving 
his testimony in favor of the laws of God be prepared by his 
grace to receive a crown of glory in the kingdom above ! 
 

You will doubtless be surprised, sir, that the trouble is given 
you of reading so long a letter, written by a lady, without any 
apparent motive ; and really, having none of weight to offer, I 
feel that an apology is due. Trifles, in the hours of relaxation, 
sometimes afford a momentary satisfaction even to the great ; 
and I have thought it might possibly tinge a passing moment 
with a ray of pleasure, to be assured that although your countrywomen can not serve you at the ballot-box, they can, and do, 
remember you at the altar. 

Not having the honor of your acquaintance, instead of my 
own unimportant name, I beg leave to subscribe, with the greatest respect, that of A True Northebn Friend. 


JUDGE STORY TO MR. CLAY. 

Cambridge, August 3, 1842. 

My dear Sir, I return you my sincere thanks for the copy 
of your <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> dinner speech, which you have been so kind 
as to send me. I have read it with deep interest. It abounds 
with passages of great eloquence and statesmanlike views, and 
lofty principles. I am a Whig, and although I do not pretend 
to mingle in the common politics of the day, there are great 
measures upon which I have a decided opinion, and which I 
would not disguise, if I could. I am for a National Bank, a 
protective Tariff, a distribution law of the public lands, and a 
permanent Bankrupt law. All these measures are, in my judgment, indispensable to the public prosperity and peace of our 
country. In promoting these measures, I know no man who 
has labored more perseveringly, or with more zeal, ability, and 
honorable devotion, than yourself, at all times. I, as one, feel 
grateful to you for these labors ; and I trust that my country 
will, for many years to come, possess the services of one whose 
eminent talents have so justly obtained the approval of the most 
enlightened minds in our public councils. 

With my best personal wishes for the entire restoration of your 
health, and for many years of life, happy as well as useful, I 
beg you to believe me, with the highest respect, truly your most 
obliged friend and servant. 



AMOS p. GRANGER AND OTHERS TO MR. CLAY. 

Steacuse, Onondaga County, New York, 
September 10, 1842. 

Dear Sir, It having recently become known among your 
friends in this town, that one of our citizens had received a 
request from you, to purchase and forward to you a quantity of 
Onondaga salt for use upon your farm at Ashland, a large meeting was immediately assembled at which it was resolved to ask 
your acceptance free of charge of a small invoice containing 
specimens of the various kinds of salt manufactured from our 
saline waters. 

The undersigned were appointed a Committee to advise you 
of the shipment and to express to you in behalf of the meeting, 
the high estimation in which your character and public services 
are held. 

We now take great pleasure in advising you of the shipment 
of twenty-three barrels to the care of January & Son, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=maysville" rel="city">Maysville</a>, 
Kentucky, with instructions to deliver to you free of charge. 
You will find specimens of common and solar salt, ground and 
refined dairy salt, which we venture to say will prove equal to 
the best quality of the imported article. 

A very large number of your friends, as will be seen by the 
inclosed list of names, accompanying the invoice, have shared 
in the gratification of exhibiting this small, but sincere manifestation of the grateful sense which they entertain of your unwavering devotion to the great interests of American industry in 
all its branches. 

Indeed, sir, those whose sentiments we are instructed to com 

mimicatej feel that your public services have laid them under a 
mightier debt of gratitude than they can express by this imperfect mark of their respect and esteem. 

Connected as they are immediately or remotely with this important branch of domestic industry, they know that their own 
prosperity and happiness vitally depend upon the maintenance 
of the principles which have guided your public life they gratefully remember that in the councils of the nation you have 
ever been the consistent friend and the eloquent advocate of 
American Labor. While others have sought the prostration of 
this and other great interests, now grown into national importance, you have always been found in opposition to the attempt. 
Your voice has ever been on the side of protection to the industry of your own country, against the blighting competition of 
foreign labor, controlled by foreign capital. 

The Saline waters of Onondaga are believed to be inexhaustible, and sufficient capital has already been invested in the manufacture of salt from them to furnish half the quantity consumed 
in the United States. Under a system of just protection that 
capital was profitably employed, and thousands of laborers in this 
and other dependent branches of industry, received a comfortable subsistence. But under the late existing laws this important interest has just reached the lowest point of depression. 
Capital is without its return, and labor without its reward. 

For the future, we hope much from the recent legislation of 
Congress in establishing a Tariff of duties upon foreign products, affording, as is believed, a fair measure of protection to domestic industry. But '^e can not forget that the war-cry of 
repeal has already been sounded. 

At such a crisis, when that great system, of which the honor 
of being the founder, belongs to you, and which it was your 
glorious ambition to establish upon a sound and permanent basis, 
had been suddenly prostrated, and when dangers are again thickening around it, your eminent services in the public councils in 
behalf of that beneficent system can not but be justly appreciated. The eyes of the nation again turn to you. 

In conclusion, sir, we beg leave to express the hope that your 
life may be long spared to your country. 

We are your friends and obedient servants. 


A. M. JANUARY TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=maysville" rel="city">Maysville</a>, September 22, 1842. 

Dear Sir, We received for you this morning from Syracuse, 
New York, twenty-three barrels salt, and one small box, eighteen 
barrels of which, and the box, we have forwarded to-day in 
Jno. Nudegate's wagon, to be delivered at Ashland free of any 
charge. The carriage we pay here on return of the wagoner 
with a receipt of the delivery, the remaining five barrels we will 
forward by the first opportunity in same way. 

Yery respectfully your friends, etc. 


LORD MORPETH TO HENRY CLAY. 

New Orleans, October 16, 1842. 

My dear Mr. Clay, I propose at present to ascend the Mississippi by the " Henry Clay," which will probably deposit me at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> by the end of this month. I am not aware whether 
you will have reached your own shades by that period, or whether you would wish the retirement to which you have consigned 
yourself to be so soon broken in upon ; but if it suited you to 
give me shelter for a day, I could not resist the temptation of 
diverging to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, and in that case perhaps you will be 
good enough to address a line to me at Post-office, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>. 

Whether it is my good fortune to meet you again or not, allow me to send you every good wish. Indeed, if I may say so 
without any inconvenient responsibility, I should be quite ready 
already to tender you my vote, if I only had one, for the next 
Presidential election. 

Believe me, my dear sir, very faithfully yours, etc. 


AIMBROSE SPENCER TO MR. CLAY. 

Lyons, N. Y., October 28, 1842. 

My dear Sir, I have read with deep mortification a letter 
addressed by my son, John C. Spencer, to certain persons in 
Rochester. Among the first ideas suggested by this letter, was 
this : Whether you would not naturally infer a coincidence on 
my part in the general sentiments of the letter ? I feel impelled 
by self-respect, and the sincere regard I have for you personally, 
as well by my admiration of your brilliant and patriotic career 
through your lifetime, to remove from your mind any erroneous 
opinions on points affecting my own consistency and honor. I 
then assure you that my son has not spoken my opinions, in 
several, and, indeed, in the main points of his letter. I have 
held no counsel with him, nor even attempted to control him, 
but have left him free to act without any advice of mine. I 
heartily concur with my Whig brethren throughout the nation, 
that Mr. Tyler has acted most perfidiously toward those who 
have elevated him to power, and I feel for him that contempt 
which his duplicity and perfidy ought to inspire in honorable 
bosoms. Although I can not think my son would knowingly 
mistate facts, yet the advice he imputes to Mr. Tyler's first Cabinet is so extraordinary that it seems to me improbable, if not 
impossible. 

When I last saw you iu <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, it was my wish to have 
a full conversation with you, but it was a period which forbade 
that gratification. 

I have now disburdened my mind from what would have 
weighed upon it, and although I should object to any publicity 
being given to this letter through the press, I have no objection to your communicating its contents to discreet friends. 

What will be the issue of our election, is impossible, in this 
great State, to be foretold with any certainty. Every thing depends on a full poll. If it be a full one, I think we shall succeed. I do not believe that Webster's speech, or Cushing's, or 
the letter, will have any materia", efiect. 

MR. BODISCO TO MR. CLAY. 

Georgetown, June 2*7, 1843. 
My dear Mr. Clay, You were among the first who treated 
me with great kindness at my arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. Since 
that time, our social intercourse has been a source of great 
gratification to me, and I would not pardon myself, if. I were 
to leave this country without expressing to you all my friendly 
feelings. Mrs. Clay must not be so jealous, if I add how much 
Mrs. Bodisco is fond of you, and how well we agree in our attachment to you. Our departure for Europe has been delayed by 
 

the nomination of a first secretary coming from Persia, and 
whom I am to present to the Secretary of State, as Charg6 d' Affaires, during my temporary absence. I expect Connt Zabello 
by the next steamer, and intend to start immediately after his 
arrival, leaving here, as a pledge of our return, two fine boys, 
and two nephews, under the care of Mrs. B.'s parents. We hope 
that all will turn out well, and in accordance with our wishes. 

The diplomatic corps has been rather amused by all the great 
discoveries lately made about Tariff treaties, and by the attempt 
to make out of Mr. Rumford a very smart man. The best 
treaty he ever negotiated, was his marriage with one of Aster's 
daughters. Bremen is one of the two great outlets of your im 
portant and growing trade with the German league. To disturb that trade for the sake of the few ships she employs, would 
be a hazardous experiment. If your Government could succeed 
by reciprocity stipulations, to have yom* grain and provisions admitted in England, we in Europe would soon enough outbid you 
in cheapness, and furnish all that would be required, corn not 
excepted, at forty-eight hours' notice. I have read with great 
attention, Mr. Clayton's able article in '' The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Inquirer." It put me in mind of the opinion on this subject, by 
one of the great men of my country. He used to say that the 
best commercial treaty is not worth a system of permanent and 
moderate protective duties at home, and full liberty for the 
trading community to provide herself with the cheapest markets. 

Flattering myself to leave here some good friends, and having 
a real interest in the prosperity of the young Giant, I '11 follow 
with undiminished solicitude, the coming events, with the hope 
that the contest will be settled according to our wishes. 

Pray remember me to all my Kentucky friends, with Crittenden at their head, and be persuaded of Mrs. Bodisco's and my 
best wishes, for you and Mrs. Clay's happiness. 


GENERAL BERTRAND TO MR. CLAY. 

A <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, le 6 Octobre, au soir, 1843. 
MoN CHER Monsieur, Etant venu a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> dans le but 
special de vous rendre mes devoirs, j'accepte avec empressement 
['invitation que vous m'avez fait I'honneur de m'addresser pour 
demain, vous priant d'agreer mes remercimens et les sentimens 
de ma haute consideration. 



PETER B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, October 11, 1843. 

My dear Sir, I received, yesterday, your favor of the 3d 
instant, and find it to be precisely what I knew it ought to be, 
and v/as sure it would be. 

The following facts, which have been confidentially communicated to me by his confidential friend, may be relied on, viz : 

That Mr. Webster, on leaving here two days ago, assured this 
friend, that he should return to Massachusetts with a determination to re-unite himself to the Whig party, and give it his best 
support. That, although there were some things in your course 
which he did not entirely approve, yet that he had a high respect 
for you, and should give you his vote and support for the Presidency. That, some few weeks since (probably when on his way 
to Rochester), he wrote a long letter to President Tyler, expostulating with him in the freest and most severe terms, upon the 
wickedness and folly of his late official course, and advising him 

to stop at once his wild career, or he would d n himself and 

ruin his country ; asking no reply to his letter, but requesting 
that it might be carefully put on file, as a subject of future reference and reflection. That, in his recent visit to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, he 
dined twice with the President once alone and in private when 
their whole political creed was canvassed and reviewed and 
once in company with the whole Cabinet, when not a word was 
said on politics and that Webster had a confidential interview 
with Mr. Upshur, Secretary of State, in which their political 
views in regard both to the present and the future, were found 
on comparison to be perfectly harmonious, and moreover, that 
they were thoroughly Whig. * * * * 

On the whole our political prospects are uncommonly bright 
and promising. The cheering and unexpected result of the 
elections in Maryland and Georgia, seems to have inspired our 
friends with new ardor and energy; and we anticipate with a 
confidence, that we have never before felt, on your triumphant 
election a year from this time. 
 



PETER B. PORTER TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, October 13, 1843. 
Dear Sir, As it seems to have been generally known among 
Mr. Webster's friends here, that I had, at the pressing solicitation 
of one of them, although under the declared conviction that it 
could produce no useful result, written to you on the subject of 
a reconciliation, and future concert of action with the Webster 
party, they were extremely anxious to know what would be 
your reply ; and, having thus committed myself by writing at 
all, it became necessary that I should advise them of your answer, 
which I have accordingly done, by reading to two or three of 
them, as also to Messrs. Lawrence, Webb, and one or two other 
Whig friends, confidentially, the following paragraphs from your 
letter, as comprising the whole it contained on that subject : 

'' I approve in the main of the answer you gave to Mr. Webster's friend. I have done him (Mr. W.) no wrong, and have 
therefore no reconciliation to seek. His course since Mr. Tyler's 
accession, but especially since the extra session, has deeply surprised me. I told him the last day of that session, ' If you mean 
to remain in Mr. Tyler's Cabinet, to finish some business not yet 
completed (alluding to the M'Leod affair), the public vnll justify 
you ; but if you mean to remain there permanently, it will condemn you.' 

" I defended him when his nomination for Secretary of State 
was before the Senate, and was very nigh getting into a personal 
affair with Mr. Cuthbert about it. 

" Should I be a candidate for the Presidency, I shall be glad 
to receive his support, or that of any other American citizen ; 
but I can enter into no arrangements, make no promises, offer no 
pledges to obtain it. It is impossible that I can be a party to 
any arrangement by which Mr. Webster, or any body else, is to 
be run as the candidate for Vice-President with me. I have 
declined all interference in behalf of Davis, Sergeant, or Clayton, 
or any body else, and must continue to do so. My duty is to 
remain perfectly passive until the nomination is made, and after 
that, to give to the nomination, of whoever may be proposed, such 
support as I can consistently with honor, delicacy, and propriety." 
Our friends were delighted with this reply, and even the 
Webster men were obliged to acknowledge that it was perfectly 
correct and proper. 

JOHN DAVIS TO MR. CLAY. 

Worcester, Mass., October 14, 1843. 

My dear Sir, I congratulate you .upon the reviving sense 
and spirit of the country. How deeply must Mr. Calhoun feel 
the results of the late elections in Tennessee, North Carolina, 
and Georgia ? How much astonished must he he to see the 
-doctrines of a protective Tariff and distribution of the proceeds 
of the public lands prevail against his theory of politics and his 
scheme of nullification ? 

The public mind has evidently been gaining strength and 
courage for some months, and the fact that it has settled down 
upon its candidate for the Presidency has aided in this desirable 
event. There seems here, in the real Whig party, to be but one 
sentiment on that head, and it looks to your name as the rallying 
word. We have difficulties and embarrassments to contend with. 
The Abolitionists, who appear to be disinclined to all connection 
with the Whigs, have strength enough, which they take from us, 
to put us in some peril. We can, however, do nothing with 
them, except to let them a^one, which is the wisest course. You 
are, however, the object at which they aim most of their shafts, 
and whom the leading members of the party are most desirous 
of defeating. We take pains to circulate your life and speeches, 
published by Greeley, as the best method of placing your character fairly before the public, and of refuting the calumnies to 
which the press gives birth. Many AboHtionists, though by no 
means all, are conscientious men, who view slavery as a sin, and 
reason to the consequences which follow. With them it constitutes the Alpha and Omega of politics and morals, and it is in 
vain to discuss the topic with such. * * * * 

Corruption and Tyler, and Tyler and corruption, will stick 
together as long as Catiline and treason. The name of Tyler 
will stink in the nostrils of the people ; for the history of our 
Government affords no such palpable example of the prostitution 
of executive patronage to the wicked purposes of bribery. The 
Locos of this State are equally criminal, and it will be hard for 
them to wipe off the stain. 

Colonel Johnson has been here, and called to see me. What 
he hopes for, or what he anticipates, is difficult to say, though 
he seems in good spirits. He wears his red jacket, and the papers 
say, and the people think, cares nothing about dress. 
 

Without detaining you with a long, unprofitable letter, I can 
not close without saying that the Whigs here have a strong feeling that you will succeed in 1844. This of itself will do much 
to accomplish so desirable a result. I should be much gratified to 
hear from you. I send without paying postage, as I see you use 
vour frank. 



J. Q. ADAMS TO MR. CLAY. 

Quincy, Massacuusetts, October 11, 1843. 

My dear Sir, T have received your very kind and friendly 
invitation, for which and for the concurring invitation of your 
lady to Mrs. Adams and to me, in her name and my own, I can 
not tender to you our sense of obligation in words adequate to 
the feelings by which they are inspired. Nothing could give 
us more pleasure than to accept your offered hospitality and to 
visit you at your residence at Ashland. 

But the state of Mrs. Adam's health will not admit of her accompanying me on this expedition ; and my own age and infirmities have admonished me that the engagement which I have 
contracted, is at least, as much as I can expect to perform with 
impunity. I have found it necessary, therefore, to limit the 
bounds of my journey within the State of Ohio, and to restrain 
all my wishes and temptations to extend my journey further. 
The visit to Kentucky, and particularly to yourself, will remain 
as a hope that I may indulge hereafter, while the kindness of 
your invitation will remain upon my memory with the most fervent good wishes for your health and happiness. 


J. SLOANE TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbus" rel="city">Columbus</a>, May 9, 1844. 

Dear Sir, Permit me to congratulate you on the happy termination of the meeting at Baltimore, as well as the wholesome 
condition of our affairs in all parts of the Union. I have for 
some time been looking for our opponents to fall back on the 
slander of bargain and sale, etc. Foiled, as they are, in every 
thing in the way of principles and measures, it was natural that 
they should place their reliance on that which required nothing 
but assertion. 

Stale and discredited as that story is, I had rather hoped that 
our friends would have let them have the entire field to themselves, and in no case agree to assume the defensive. But the 
 

course of some of the Whigs in Congress has, perhaps, made it 
necessary" to meet the enemy again on the same old field. 

In Ohio, I think this will be their only reliance, but I can see 
nothing indicating the least success from its use. 

Were I referred to, by some one else, I could give information 
in the case perhaps more direct than any other person. It is 
this : About the time mentioned by Buchanan, or, perhaps, some 
earher, I met with General Houston at Mr. Fletcher's boardinghouse, and was accosted by him on the subject of the vote of 
Ohio. I told him there had been no general consultation among 
the members. He then observed, " What a most splendid 
Administration it would make, with ' Old Hickory' for President, and Mr. Clay Secretary of State." To this I assented. 
He then went on to address himself more earnestly to me, and 
said : "I feel a strong hope you will all vote for Hickory, and 
in that event, you know your man can get any thing he may 
want." To all this I replied, in substance, that the vote of the 
Ohio delegation, when given, I had no doubt would be satisfactory to the citizens of the State. 

This conversation was in my full recollection at the time I 
made my statement, which was appended to your address, and 
an allusion of a general nature was made to it. Why I did not 
specify the facts as they took place, was, my knowledge of the 
relation which existed between Jackson and Houston, and the 
great probability that the latter would not dare to do other than 
deny the whole. This, in the then temper of the public mind, 
I thought might do more harm than good. What I may ultimately do in that behalf, will depend on after developments. 



THEODORE FRELINGHUYSEN TO MR. CLAY. 

New Yoek, May 11, 1844. 
My DEAR Sir, I have been rather impatiently waiting for 
my lame arm to write a few lines to my honored friend, that I 
might express to you the heartfelt gratification that I feel at the 
recent association of my humble name with yours, a distinction 
as honorable as it has been to me surprising. And should the 
results of the fall elections confirm the nomination, of which 
there now seems very strong indications, it will, I assure you, 
be among my richest political privileges to contribute any mite 
of influence in my power to render prosperous and lasting in 
benefits the Administration of a patriot, whose elevation I have 
long desired. Oar names have been brought together, here, by 
the voice of our fellow men. My prayer for you and my own 
soul shall be fervent, that, through the rich grace of our Saviour, 
they may be found written in the Book of Life of the Lamb that 
was slain for our sins. 

My good wife, who has never ceased to cherish the hope of 
your eventual elevation to the Chief Magistracy, unites with me 
in kindest respects to Mrs. Clay and yourself. 

P. S. My hand is still lame, and I can Avrite only in irregular characters. 



J. SLOANE TO MR. CLAY. 

WoosTER, June 20, 1844. 

My dear Sir, ^Your favor of the 14th instant, directed to me 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbus" rel="city">Columbus</a>, reached me at this place yesterday. Your first on 
the same subject was also duly received here. On the first 
Monday of next month it is my purpose to be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> ; and 
I had thought of delaying my statement until then, but since the 
receipt of your last, I have determined to make it to-morrow. I 
see by the newspapers from various parts that the subject is 
being agitated ; and, in Ohio, the Locofoco candidate for Governor is hurling it from the stump. Why Governor Letcher should 
feel any delicacy about making a statement, out of any amity 
between him and Buchanan, I am at a loss to imagine. Mr. 
Buchanan, by his equivocation and want of directness in his 
answer to Jackson's appeal, put himself beyond all claim upon 
the forbearance of any one. The manner in which he dragged 
Mr. Markley into the afiair, and the cautious manner in which he 
spoke of Jackson, left it beyond dispute that it was his object 
that his statement should not be so understood as to do justice 
between the parties. 

When my statement reaches you, and you have that of Governor Letcher, you can determine how you will dispose of them. 
I always intended to make the facts known to you, if for no 
 

Other purpose than that it might go into the history of the case 
after we have gone hence. 

My opinion of the necessity of the publication I will transmit 
to you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>. 

MB. SLOANe's statement. 

WoosTER, June 20, 1 844. 

In December, 1824, about the time that the choice of President 
by the House of Representatives was beginning to attract attention at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, I happened in company with General Houston, then a member of Congress from Tennessee, when the 
subject of that election was introduced by him. Although the 
subject of the Presidential election, from the time of the commencement of the canvass before the people, had been fully discussed between us, this was the first time, after the people had 
failed to elect, that we had conversed in relation to it. General 
Houston commenced by suggesting that he supposed the Ohio 
delegation were all going to vote for General Jackson. To this 
I answered that I could not undertake to speak for them ; for, so 
far as I knew, no meeting or consultation had taken place among 
them. The manner of General Houston was anxious, and 
evinced much solicitude ; and at this point of the conversation 
he exclaimed, " What a splendid Administration it would make, 
with Old Hickory President, and Mr. Clay Secretary of State." 
Having often before expressed to General Houston my opinion 
of the several candidates, I did not, at that time, think proper to 
repeat it : contenting myself with an implied acquiescence in the 
correctness of his declaration. 

The conversation was continued for a considerable time, and 
for the most part had relation to Western interests as connected 
with the Presidency, and was concluded by General Houston 
obsei-ving, " Well, I hope you from Ohio will aid us in electing 
General Jackson, and then your man (meaning Mr. Clay) can 
have any thing he pleases." 

These expressions of General Houston made a strong impression on my mind at the time, and from the relations knovv^n to 
subsist between him and General Jackson, I had not then, nor 
at any time since, a doubt but that they embodied the feelings 
of that personage ; and that it v/as the object of both that Mr. 
Clay and his friends should so understand it. And I have ever 
thought that the slanderous charge of "■ bargain, corruption, and 
intrigue," subsequently preferred by General Jackson against Mr. 
Clay and his friends, had its origin in the utter neglect with 
which every advance made to them by the friends of General 
Jackson was treated. 

In a letter written by me, dated at Wooster, May 9th, 1827, 
and appended to Mr. Clay's address to the public of that year, 
I referred to " the importunity of some of General Jackson's 
friends," as indicative of a disposition to enter into a bargain. 
In that remark I had in my mind, among other things, those 
observations of General Houston. Should it now be asked why 
I did not then divulge the whole, my answer is, that although I 
held myself at all times ready to do so, if called upon, I did not 
then consider it necessary. The only question, then, before the 
public, was the charge that Mr. Clay's friends had made propositions to Jackson for a bargain. It was to repel that charge that 
my letter above-mentioned was written ; and I chose to confine 
my statements to the nature of the issue. In attempting to sustain that issue, General Jackson most signally failed, being flatly 
contradicted by his only witness. 



R. p. LETCHER TO MR. CLAY. 

Fkankfort, July C, 1844. 

Mt dear Sir, I send you, inclosed, a short love-letter, which 
I received a day or two ago from my old friend Buck. He 
writes like a man, as you will see, who feels the force of his subject. You can retain it until I see you. 

The more I have thought about your making a publication in 
regard to that miserable old calumny, the less inclined I am to 
think favorably of it. Every thing appears to be progressing so 
smoothly for the Whig cause, " better let it be." 



MR. BUCHANAN TO R. P. LETCHER. 

Lancaster, June 27, 1844. 

My dear Sir, I have this moment received your very kind 
letter and hasten to giv^e it an answer. I can not perceive what 

good purpose it would subserve Mr. Clay to publish the private 
and unreserved conversation to which you refer. I was then 
his ardent friend and admirer ; and much of this ancient feeling 
still survives, notwithstanding our political differences since. I 
did him ample justice, but no more than justice, both in my 
speech on Chilton's resolutions and in my letter in answer to General Jackson. 

I have not myself any very distinct recollection of what transpired in your room nearly twenty years ago ; but doubtless I 
expressed a strong wish to himself, as I had done a hundred 
times to others, that he might vote for General Jackson ; and if 
he desired it, become his Secretary of State. Had he voted for 
the General, in case of his election, I should most certainly have 
exercised any influence I might have possessed to accomplish 
this result ; and this I should have done from the most disinterested, friendly and patriotic motives. 

This conversation of mine, whatever it may have been, can 
never be brought home to General Jackson. I never had but 
one conversation with him on the subject of the then pending 
election, and that upon the street, and the whole of it, vcrhatim et literatim, when comparatively fresh upon my memory, was given to the public iu my letter of August, 1827. The 
publication, then, of this private conversation could serve no 
other purpose than to embarrass me and force me prominently 
into the pending contest which I desire to avoid. 

You are certainly correct in your recollection. " You told me 
explicitly that you did not feel at liberty to give the conversation alluded to, and would not do so, under any circumstances 
without my express permission." In this you acted, as you have 
ever done, like a man of honor and principle. 



J. C. WRIGHT TO Jm. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, September 5, 1844. 

My dear Sir, On the other leaf you will find the statement 
of my conversation with Louis M'Lane, which I promised you. 
My apology for not preparing it sooner is that my engagements 
scarcely leave me a moment of leisure. 

I have your letter on the subject of the Blue Lick lie, and you 
will have seen in " The Gazette" the use made of it. I should 
 

certainly with you have felt no little mortification, had I thought 
it necessary to call upon you to refute so improbable a calumny. 
Bat the charge was reiterated upon the face of my denial, and 
the proof in writing said to exist under these circiyustances, 
I thought it proper that you see the charge and have an opportunity to say if any circumstance had taken place out of which to 
fabricate the story. I know well, sir, that even the father of 
lies himself could hardly keep pace with the supporters of Polk, 
in inventing and giving circulation to lies, and I do not often 
heed them. 

Upon the whole our prospects are as favorable as when I had 
the pleasure of meeting you. Our opponents are very active 
and unscrupulous in the use of the means they employ. The 
small majority in Kentucky has been rung in all its changes 
and has passed away. Your late letter on the Texas question 
has given the rascals a new impulse. Liberty-men, Locofocos, 
and timid Whigs, use the letter as a bug-a-boo to the anti-annexation. We defend it, as in accordance with what you before said, 
and I think it will leave little injurious impression upon the minds 
of our friends. But the public mind is excited men are confederated together in appeals to the very worst passions of our 
nature, and the public mind is feverish, and unstable. This 
will not be more than a nine day's topic of vituperation. With 
the old issues we are safe, depend upon it. All we want is to 
bring the voters out. 



J. C. WRIGHT TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, September 5, 1844. 
Dear Sir, According to my promise, I give below a statement of the conversation between Mr. Louis McLane and myself, relative to the election of Mr. Adams by the House of Representatives in 1825. We were both members of the House, 
and of the committee to report rules for the government of the 
House in conducting the election. He was known to be in favor 
of Mr. Crawford, and I was in favor of Mr. Adams. On the morning of the election, he and I walked together from the Committee room to the House, and were conversing about the prospects 
of the candidates. At the door we stopped, and he asked if we 
could elect Mr. Adams ? I answered that we could elect him, as 
I thought, on the first ballot. I trust in God you will succeed, 
said he, and on the first ballot, and save the country from the 
curse of Jacksonism. You know I must vote for Crawford on 
the first pallet, as my State voted for him, but we all know he 
can not be elected, and I sincerely hope you will elect Mr. 
Adams. We separated, and took our seats. In a short time the 
vote was taken, and Mr. Adams got the votes of thirteen States, 
and was declared duly elected. 

This is the substance of the conversation, if not the very 
words. Mr. McLane spoke openly, with energy, and I thought, 
sincerely. 


THEODORE FRELINGHUTSEN TO MR. CLAY. 

Xew York, K'ovember 9, 1844. 
My dear Sir, I address you this morning with very different feelings from my expectations a few weeks ago. The alliance of the foreign vote, and that most impractical^le of all 
organizations, the Abolitionists, have defeated the strongest national vote ever given to a Presidential candidate. The Whigs 
in this city and State have struggled most nobly. All classes 
of American citizens have ardently, cordially, and with the freest 
sacrifices, contended for your just claims to patriotic confidence, 
and could you this morning behold the depression of spirits 
and sinking of hearts that pervade the community, I am sure 
that you would feel, " Well, in very truth, my defeat has been 
the occasion of a more precious tribute and vindication than even 
the majority of numbers." 

The Abolitionists were inimicably obstinate, and seemed resolved to distinguish their importance, right or wrong. The 
combination of adverse circumstances has often struck me in the 
progress of the canvass. At the South, 1 was denounced as an 
Abolitionist, rank and uncompromising. Here, the Abolitionists 
have been rancorous in their hostility. A short time since, 
William Jay (of illustrious name) assailed me in his Anti-Slavery prints, by a harsh, unphristian, and intolerant article, in the 
form of a letter addressed to me, but sent to the winds. Its 
object was, no doubt, to drive the party together, and it had, 1 
suppose, some influence that way, although it was too bitter and 
iiTational to accomplish much. And then the foreign vote was 
tremendous. More than three thousand, it is confidently said, 
have been naturalized in this city, alone, since the first of October. It is an alarming fact, that this foreign vote has decided the great questions of American policy, and counteracted a 
nation's gratitude. 

But, my dear sir, leaving this painful subject, let us look 
away to brighter and better prospects, and surer hopes, in the 
promises and consolations of the Gospel of our Saviour. As sinners who have rebelled against our Maker, we need a Saviour 
or we must perish, and this Redeemer has been provided 
for us. Prophecy declared him from the earliest period of 
our fall, in Paradise, and the Gospel makes known the faithful fulfillment. " Come unto me," cries this exalted Saviour, 
" come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, 
and I will give you rest." Let us, then, repair to Him. He 
will never fail us in the hour of peril and trial. Vain is the 
help of man, and frail and fatal all trust in the arm of flesh ; but 
he that trusteth in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion itself, that 
can never be removed. I pray, my honored friend, that your 
heart m-dj seek this blessed refuge, stable as the everlasting 
hills, and let this be the occasion to prompt an earnest, prayerful, and the Lord grant it may be a joyful, search after truth as 
it is in Jesus Christ. 

With aflectionate regards to Mrs. Clay, in which my good 
wife, sorely tried, heartily unites, I remain with sincere esteem 
and best wishes, your friend.* 

* It is thought proper to introduce a few of the very large file of letters to Mr 
Clay on the disappointment at his defeat as candidate for the Presidency in 1844, 
of which the above from Mr. Frelinghuysen, the candidate for the Vice-Presi 
dency, on the ticket with Mr. Clay, is one. 
 

THOMAS H. BAIBD TO MR. CLAY. 

PiiTSBURG, November 30, 1844. 

My dear SiRj The result of the late elections, although disastrous to the country, yet, when properly examined, furnishes a 
proud vindication of your principles and fame. No man ever 
before received so glorious a testimonial. I believe, in fact, you 
had a majority of the legal votes throughout the Union. One 
thing, however, is certain. You had nine tenths of the virtue, 
intelligence, and respectability of the nation on your side. We 
failed in obtaining your election through the fraud and falsehood of our opponents, who will soon feel the effects of their 
folly and crime. The defeat is nothing to you ; it is the people 
who are to be the sufferers, until delusion is dispelled, and they 
rise in their strength to cast off the oppressors. 

I have no doubt that the principles which you have so long 
i\nd so ably struggled to maintain, will at last be triumphant. 
They are identified with your person and character, and must 
be vindicated. 



MILLARD FILLMORE TO MR. CLAY. 

Buffalo, November 11, 1844. 

My dear Sir, I have thought for three or four days that I 
would write you, but really I am unmanned. I have no courage 
or resolution. All is gone. The last hope, which hung first 
upon the city of New York and then upon Virginia, is finally 
dissipated, and I see nothing but despair depicted on every countenance. 

For myself I have no regrets. I was nominated much against 
my will, and though not insensible to the pride of success, yet 1 
feel a kind of relief at being defeated. But not so for you or 
for the nation. Every consideration of justice, every feeling of 
gratitude conspired in the minds of honest men to insure your 
election ; and though always doubtful of my own success I could 
never doubt yours, till the painful conviction was forced upon 
me. 

The Abolitionists and foreign Catholics have defeated us in 
this State. I will not trust myself to speak of the vile hypocrisy of the leading Abolitionists now. Doubtless many acted 
honestly but ignorantly in what they did. But it is clear that 
Birney and his associates sold themselves to Looofocoism, and 
they will doubtless receive their reward. 

Our opponents, by pointing to the Native Americans and to 
Mr. Frelinghuysen, drove the foreign Catholics from us and defeated us in this State. 

Bat it is vain to look at the causes by which this infamous result 
has been produced. It is enough to say that all is gone, and I 
must confess that nothing has happened to shake my confidence in 
our ability to sustain a free Government so much as this. If with 
such issues and such candidates as the national contest presented, 
we can be beaten, what may we not expect ? A cloud of gloom 
hangs over the future. May God save the country ; for it is evident the people will not. 



J. J. CKITTENDEN TO MR. CLAY. 

Feansfoet, November 13, 1844. 
My dear Sir, The intelligence brought to us this morning 
has terminated all our hopes, our suspense, and our anxieties, in 
respect to the Presidential election. We now know the worst. 
Polk is elected, and your friends have sustained the heaviest 
blow that could have befallen them. You will feel, I trust, no 
other concern about it than that which naturally arises from your 
sympathy with those friends. You are, perhaps, the only man 
in the nation that can lose nothing by the result. Success could 
have added nothing to your name, and nothing, I believe, to 
your happiness. You occupy now, but too truly, the position 
described as presenting the noblest of human spectacles 

" A great man struggling "with the storms of fate, 
And nobly falling Avith a falling state." 



C. L. L. LEARY TO MR. CLAY. 

Baltoioee, November 14, 1844. 
Dear Sir, The inexpressible agony which the result of the 
recent contest has caused me, has Left me no other source of 
relief than the one which I have here chosen. I beg you, sir, 
to accept this as a sufficient apology for this intrusion. I am too 
well acquainted with your character to suppose that this result 
will affect you as it has affected your friends. That consciousness 
of purity of motive and of mibendinj^ rectitude, which has sustained you on former occasions, when the honor and prosperity 
of your country were the objects which alone you aimed at, and 
when your designs were purposely misconstrued by the envy 
and vindictive malice of your enemies, will still support you in 
this trying crisis ; and in the patriotic efforts and ardent personal 
devotion of your friends, you will, I feel assured, realize enjoyments which all the honors of public station would fail to bestow. 
Whatever may have been the impelling considerations in the 
breasts of others, I am free to confess that " Justice to Henry 
Clay," rather than the behests of public duty, was the ruling 
motive which prompted me to the humble part I acted in the 
late conflict. Amid the gloom and chagrin of defeat, I devoutly thank God that the family with which I am connected, 
including a father and four sons, native-born American citizens, 
and competent voters, have not been reckless of the duty they 
owed to you and to their country, and that our beloved and 
venerated old Maryland, with a devotion that has never faltered 
when the true issue has been presented to her sons, has proclaimed trumpet-tongued to the world her confidence in your 
integrity, and her stern adherence to constitutional principles. 1 
console myself, too, (and to you it must be a source of unfailing 
gratulation), that 1 find myself arrayed in this contest on the 
same side with the enlightened intelligence, virtue, and patriotism of the Union, with the line of discrimination so broadly and 
vividly drawn, that " the wayfaring man," though a fool in other 
matters, "need not err therein." Whatever partial triumphs we 
have won, have been achieved by honest American hearts, and 
with unstained American hands ; no levies have been made upon 
the prisons and lazar-housesof Europe ; no Canadian mercenaries 
or Hessian auxiliaries have been either pressed or purchased into 
our service ; you are the only choice of the great American party, 
standing upon a broad American platform, supported and dependent upon an American Constitution, as framed, understood, 
and construed by the Patriot Fathers of the Republic. We are 
told in Holy Writ that " The wicked walk on every side, when 
the vilest men are exalted ;" and in this humiliating posture we 
now find American affairs. The very fountain of our political 

system, from whence all authority and power flow, is revoltingly 
corrupt. The ballot-box is poisoned by gross ignorance and 
wanton perjury. The ermine of justice is spotted, and the 
judicial bench disgraced by undisguised partisan conduct, that in 
the better days of the Republic would have condemned the actors 
to merited infamy. To what source, then, are we to look for 
deliverance ? Alas, sir, I only speak as hundreds of American 
Whigs this moment feel, when I say that I shudder for the fate 
of my country. I know that numbers of your fellow-citizens, of 
the class to which I belong, have opposed your elevation, and it 
is because I keenly feel the reproach which this fact awakens, 
that I have thus ventured to address you. But be assured, sir, 
that wherever you have a friend you will find friendship worth 
possessing, flowing from warm hearts, whose every affection is 
yours, and wholly yours. You may never again permit yourself to be called upon the stage of public life ; but whatever 
course your sense of duty may urge you to take, I fervently 
trust that the Common Father of us all may lavish his choicest 
blessings upon your declining years, and that, amid the contentment which retirement from political turmoil brings, you will 
recognize Maryland, Kentucky, and their sister Whig States, as 
having heartily accorded to you that tribute of justice and gratitude which an ungrateful country has failed to bestow. 



p. S. GALPIN AND OTHERS TO MR. CLAY. 

New Haven, Conn., November 16, 1844. 

Sir, It is with much pleasure that we execute the duty assigned to us by the Whigs of this city, of transmitting to you 
the inclosed proceedings of a meeting held by them, on the evening of the 14th inst.; but this pleasure is mingled with the 
deepest regret, that we can not hail you, as we had fondly hoped, 
as President of these United States. The deplorable result of 
the late election, has here, as every where, filled the hearts of 
your Whig friends with pain and mortification, and this, feeling 
has not been confined to the voters only, but has extended itself 
through all ages, sexes, and conditions, from " lisping infancy to 
hoary age." 

We were not aware, until we saw our anticipations of your 
 

success blighted, how strong a hold you had upon our affectionSj 
and we now feel that you are President in the hearts of a vast 
majority of the intelligent and patriotic citizens of the country, 
where you can never be defeated, and where the poisonous shafts 
of calumny can never reach you. Had you been called to assume 
the reponsibilities of the office of Chief Magistrate of the Union, 
we feel sure that the most eminent success in the discharge of its 
duties could not have increased your fame, or led us to cherish 
any warmer feelings than we now entertain for your character 
and public services. 

We are proud, sir, of our city, for the vote she gave you, 
which was larger than ever given before to any candidate in a 
contested election, and we are proud of our State ; that amid all 
the deceptions and slanders which have marked the course of 
our opponents throughout the late contest, she has given you a 
majority worthy of her character, and of the intelligence of her 
citizens. 

May your valuable life, dear sir, be spared through many years 
to bless the country you have so greatly honored, and whose interest in times of danger you have so often and so nobly upheld. 



AMBROSE SPENCER TO MR. CLAY. 

Albany, November 21, 1844. 

My dear Friend, I can no longer resist the inclination which 
impels me to commune with you on the disastrous results of the 
efforts of the Whig party to do justice to you for your long and 
signal services to your country, by placing you at the head of 
the nation. 

It is pretty well ascertained that had New York given you 
her vote, you would have been elected. This consideration is 
very mortifying to us ; and yet, I venture to affirm, that in no 
State of the Union had you warmer, or more vigilant and vigorous supporters. Every thing that could be effected by human 
means was done. I know many, very many men, who laid 
aside all other business, and devoted themselves night and day 
in the good cause. The result of our canvass shows what 
mighty efforts have been made. You received 232,411 votes; 
Polk received 237,432; Birney, 15,875. What a monstrous 
poll. You received 6.594 more votes than Harrison did in 1840, 
when his majority exceeded 13,000. You will perceive that 
the Abolition vote lost you the election, as three fourths of them 
were firm Whigs, converted into Abolitionists. The foreign 
vote also destroyed your election, and there was yet another distinct cause : the utter mendacity, frauds, and villainies of Locofocoism. This untoward event has produced universal gloom, 
and has shaken public confidence to an unexpected extent. 
Even many of those who voted for Polk, now that he is elected, 
deeply regret the result. God only knows to what we are destined. One sentiment seems to prevail universally, that the nat-. 
urahzation laws must be altered ; that they must be repealed, 
and the door forever shut on the admission of foreigners to citizenship, or that they undergo a long probation. I am for the 
former. 

The Germans and the Irish are in the same category ; the one 
who know not our language, and are as ignorant as the lazaroni 
of Italy, can never understandingly exercise the franchise ; and 
the other, besides their ignorance, are naturally inclined to go 
with the loafers of our own population. 

I offer you not any condolence at this sad event ; the country, 
not you, are the sufierers. Undoubtedly, 3^our election would 
have been deeply gratifying to your feelings, as the award of 
your countrymen on your long, unwearied, and splendid public 
services. You have been spared the toils of four years hard 
service, which could not have raised you higher in the affections 
and confidence of your friends and admirers. Your Administration would have put at rest all contention on the duty and necessity of protecting American industry; on the distribution of 
the proceeds of the public lands, and on many other vexed questions, which are now set afloat and put in jeopardy. In yielding 
my hearty support to the Whig cause, you are aware that I had 
no earthly motive but the public good. I confess that in doing 
all I could to promote your election, there was an additional 
motive : the deep respect and aftection I felt for you individually, 
founded on your public services, and on those personal qualities 
which, on our first acquaintance, took a lodgment in my heart, 
never to be efi"aced. 

That you may live long to enjoy, in any situation Providence 
may place you, the continued love and confidence of your countxymen, and all the blessings of this life, is my fervent prayer. 


WILLIAM C. PRESTON* TO MR. CLAY. 

Columbia, November 23, 1844. 
Dear Sir, My sense of the public calamity has, for some 
days, absorbed all emotions and affections of a private or personal 
character. I have been astonished with the result of the elections. The ways of nations, like those of Providence, are sometimes mysterious and inscrutable ; and what our country has just 
done is of this sort. With the deepest interest in v/hatever concerns you personally, I have been solely occupied with these 
gloom}'' and portentous occurrences. What do they forebode to 
the country ? As for you, they affect you in nowise but as 
depriving you of the means of further patriotic usefulness. You 
have long since passed that point when office could confer additional celebrity, or add an inch to the noble pre-eminence 
which history will assign to you. Though your name will not 
appear in the dull chronology of official succession, the times 
will be known as those in which the Vv^isdom, courage and eloquence of Clay were displayed for the glory of his country. The 
time will come vvhen all will be ashamed of these transactions. 
May God protect us from occasion to mourn over them in sorrow 
and bitterness of repentance. It would be vain and painful to 
speculate on the causes which hav^e led to this result. The consequences of it will soon occupy the utmost anxieties of the 
country. For the present the Whig party of the South is dispersed ; and we can not know our position until the heat and 
smoke of the conflict have passed away. In the mean time I 
content myself with the thought that I have (in however subordinate a station) fought the battle of the country under your 
standard, and am entitled to subscribe myself, etc. 



CHRISTOPHER HUGHES TO MR. CLAY. 

London, November 21, 1844. 

My DEAR Mr. Clay ; my chief, my old master, my venerated and beloved friend ! 

In an hour I shall be in the steamer for Rotterdam and the 
Hague. I am literally packing my trunk, and in great confusion ! 
But I shall be too late to write from Holland by the steamer of 
the 4th December, and I will not lose a moment in conveying 
to you the heartfelt emotion, amazement, and grief with which 
I have received the news, just arrived, of the result of the Presidential election. Great God ! is it possible ! Have our people 
given this astonishing, this alarming proof of the madness to 
which party frenzy can carry them ! England is astounded ; 
on all hands I hear amazement, sorrow, uneasiness expressed ; 
for in you and on your election depends, in the minds of this^ 
people and Government, the maintenance of harmony and peaceful relations between the two nations. The hopes of the wise 
and of the worthy of the New and of the Old World, rested 
(and seem to rest no, now no more, for it is over) upon you. 
But I can not, if I would, dwell upon this matter. My heart is 
sad ; and my time is up for embarking. 

Let me, my beloved old friend, approach you in your defeat, 
with my ancient, my true, my invariable love, confidence, devotion and esteem ; ay ! let me add and my admiration and 
honor. Since our first acquaintance in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>, when we left our 
country to send home peace to our people, I have never no, 
never deserted you, in thought, in heart, or in deed ! Never 
have I disguised my preference, my respect, my love and admiration for you ; and I have prized, as the greatest success and 
honor of my life, your friendship for me, and the cheerful, amiable, playful, affectionate familiarity that you have always permitted and tolerated in me, your pupil and your friend. I know 
you have always loved me and trusted me. My eyes now run 
over ^before God they do ! ^with the recollection of your affection and fondness for me, my great and good friend ! I am 
weeping as we both did, when comparatively young men on 
the 2d December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1814">1814</a>, the day we signed the peace of Ghent 
— when you threw your arms around my neck in bidding me 
adieu, seeing how sad I was; and exclaimed "Hughes! my 
friend, what is the matter with you ? I see that you are unhappy." I said that I was mortified at finding, that in the last 
'' dispatches" to the Government at home (which I myself had 
copied, and was to bear home with the treaty), there was no 
mention of my name by my ministers, whom I had served with 
so much zeal, fidelity, and honor that this mortified and pained 
me. You told me there had been such a sentence at the close 
of the last dispatch, that it had been erased as not properlj'' belonging to a public document, and was repeated in all your private letters to the Secretary of State, and to Mr. Madison, that 
admirable and incomparable man, whom I knew and loved. 
This did not appease me, and I said, Good God ! are not the 
character and conduct of public servants, when they are honorable, proper in the public and published archives of the country ? 
But I loved you, my excellent and kind-hearted friend, for the 
kindness and tenderness of your conduct. You embraced me 
you wept like a child your heart was full of the pride and 
pleasure and comfort of having achieved peace for your country, and you did more at that Congress than any other of its 
members, by your tact, your discretion, your moderation, your 
angelic self-command, and your incomparable manner ; you did 
more and I say it, and will bear this witness before the world 
— than any other, to bestow this most blessed of boons, this 
God-like gift, Peace among men ; for, like tiie harmony of 
heaven, it passeth all understanding ! You wept like a child on 
taking leave of me ; you thought of your country, of your family, of your excellent wife, of your then alas ! no longer so 
numerous family of young children ; of me, who was leaving 
you in Europe, and about to embark in the dead of winter, and 
in a schooner (I was sixty days on the voyage), for our awful 
and dangerous coast ! Your heart and a kinder and a more 
alfectionate one never filled the bosom of mortal man your 
heart was full, and you wept like a child, as I do now, my dear 
Mr. Cla_y, in recalling this scene ! "VYe were alone, in the corridor of old Madame Yan Canegheu's house (for you had followed me out of the room, seeing how sad I was), where we 
had dined after signing the Treaty at the British Minister's -you, 
my chief, had signed your last dispatch at Mme. Yan C.'s, 
which I was to bear; and the good old lady thought it was " the 
Treaty," and the pen you used is in a glass case in her house, 
sacredly preserved to this day ; for Mme. Yan C. continued to 
believe that the peace had been made under her roof, and 
boasted of it till her death, twenty-five years after, and showed 
me, proudly, ^' the precious pen !" But I must stop. May God 
forever bless you ! May he preserve you long for your country ! 
No man now I say, no man knows you as well as I do ! No, 
not one ! and I ever have loved and esteemed you, and it is my 
pride to feel so have you me. Why, I could see comfort in 

your heart and manner whenever I have been with you. You 
seemed to feel as if there was a safety, an ease, a pleasing security, when I was with yon. Again and again, may God bless 
and preserve you. I write incoherently : you would not believe 
my emotion. My head is confused. 

I send this letter open to my beloved Joseph Ingersoll. I can 
not write to him. You know how I love and esteem him. You 
know how I have written of him to you. He will read and 
send you this letter. I know not, and never have known, a better man than J. R. Ingersoll. I have not written to you twice 
in two years ! I shall do so now. I will never desert you. I 
will love you ; honor you away, and cheer you when at home, 
as I suppose I shall be soon. I have been in Ireland, to see my 
good brother-in-law. Colonel Moore. His health is better. He 
returns to the United States next May. He was heart and soul 
for you in the election. My silence proceeded from low spirits ; 
I have shaken them off, and my health and my heart are sound 
and stout. 

I passed an hour with Mr. Goulburne (Chancellor of Excheqeuer) day before the fatal news. He asked for you, and sends 
respects to you. He received me most affectionately. I never 
was treated with more kindness than now in England. No time 
to read this. While I live I am yours. 



p. H. SYLVESTER AND OTHERS TO MR. CLAY. 

CossACKu;, November 27, 1844. 

Dear Sir, I write to you in behalf of the Coxsackie Clay 
Club. The man v/ho said " that he stood firm and erect, unbent, unbroken, unsubdued, unawed, and ready to denounce the 
mischevious measures of General Jackson's Administration," 
needs no sympathy from us. 

It .is from the gushing out and fullness of our hearts that we 
say to you that you have been our political idol, and that we esteem you as highly, and love you as dearly as we ever have 
done in defeat, more than in victory we can not say more, 
how can we say less ? 

When we were convinced that we were defeated, we felt as 
if we had no country, and that all that we considered as most 
 

sacred and most cherished by us in it, was wrested from us by 
the insult that was offered to our own great and honest '' Harry 
of the West." 

There is one consolation to us, however, and that is, that your 
name will live. Yes, it must, it shall live forever, in undying, 
honorable fame. The measure of your glory was full to overflowing, and if success had crowned our exertions, would it have 
woven another wreath in the garland of fame that encircles your 
brow ? Not one. 

Your nomination was but the spontaneous and unanimous outbreaking of the feelings of a great majority of the intelligent and 
patriotic freemen of the land. By them you have been supported 
with the whole heart and soul and strength, with an intensity of 
feeling and exertion almost unparalleled, and every Whig heart is 
strickea down, and mourns that the Republic has exhibited such 
an instance of ingratitude. 

We do not wish to burden you with our correspondence, but 
permit us to say in conclusion, that Henry Clay is more than 
ever beloved by his countrymen, and that posterity will do him 
justice. Our discomfiture only increases our respect and admiration for your character, and gratitude for your services. We 
point v/ith unutterable pride to the fact that we cast our vote's 
for the man " who would rather be right, than be President." 

In behalf of each member of the Association, I tender you 
sentiments of affection, respect, and undiminished confidence 
and esteem. 

Let me say for myself individually, may Almighty God bless 
you, may he lift upon you the light of his reconciled countenance, and prepare you for an abundant entrance into the abodes 
of more than mortal freedom. 



PHILIP HONE TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, November 28, 1844. 
My dear Sir, I hesitate and doubt whether I ought to add to 
the annoyance which I know you experience at this time, but I 
can not deny myself the privilege of writing to you, not to condole with you on your recent defeat, I know you feel little regret 
on your own account, but to give vent to my own sorrow, to deplore the infatuation of my countrymen, and to mingle my prayers 
with yours, that the evils we anticipate from the unexpected result of the late election may be averted, and the people made 
happy against their own wayward wills. 

You, and the holy cause of which you were the honored representative, have been sacrificed to fraud, corruption and misrepresentation, and the instruments used to effect the object were 
foreign voters made to order, and mischievous sectarians, who 
prefer to trust the success of their theory to the uncertain measures of an untried Administration than to one pledged to support 
the glorious Constitution and to maintain its guarantees. 

The result of this election has satisfied me that no such man 
as Henry Clay can ever be President of the United States. The 
party leaders, the men who make Presidents, will never consent 
to elevate one greatly their superior ; they suffer too much by 
the contrast, their aspirations are checked, their power is circumscribed, the clay can not be moulded into an idol suited to their 
worship. Moreover, a statesman, prominent as you have been 
for so long a time, must have been identified with all the leading measures affecting the interests of the people, and those interests are frequently different in the several parts of our widely 
extended country. What is meat in one section is poison in 
another. Give me, therefore, a candidate of an inferior grade, 
one whose talents, patriotism and public services have never been 
so conspicuous as to force him into the first ranks. He will get 
all the votes which the best and v/isest man could secure, and 
some, which for the reasons I have stated, he could not. 

But the especial object of my writing is to remove any unfavorable impressions (if such there be) from your mind as to the 
miserable result here. The loss of New York was fatal to the 
cause of the Whigs, but I pray you, dear sir, to attribute no part 
of this misfortune to a want of exertion on the part of your 
friends in the city of New York. Never before did they work 
so faithfully, and never, I fear, will they again ; the man and the 
cause were equally dear to the noble Whigs, and every honorable 
exertion was made, every personal sacrifice submitted to, every 
libei^l oblation poured upon the altar of patriotic devotion ; ninetenths of our respectable citizens voted for Clay and Frelinghuysen, the merchants, the professional men, the mechanics and 
working men, all such as live by their skill and the labor of their 
honest hands, who have wives whom they cherish and children 
whom they strive to educate and make good citizens, men who 
 

go to church on Sundays, respect the laws and love their country, such men to the number of twenty-six thousand three hundred and eighty-five redeeijied their pledge to God and the 
country ; but alas ! the numerical strength lies not in those classes. 
Foreigticrs who have " no lot or inheritance" in the matter, have 
robbed us of our birth-right, the " scepter has departed from Israel." Ireland has re-conquered the country which England 
lost, but never suffer yourself to believe that a single trace of the 
name of Henry Clay is obliterated from the swelling hearts of 
the Whigs of New York. 



JOHN H. WESTWOOD TO MR. CLAY. 

Baltimore, November 2S, 1844. 
Respected Sir, ^Now that the Presidential contest is over, 
and the disastrous result is known, I can address you without 
the fear of selfishness, or a desire of ingratiating myself to your 
notice for personal motives. 

I was one of youv early and fast friends, and have stood by 
yon in all the phases of political strife. I imbibed those predilections from a knowledge of your history, which is identified 
with the glory, prosperity, and happiness of om- country. My 
venerated father who was a Whig of the Revolution, and who 
recently died at the advanced age of ninety-four, was likewise 
your constant and fast friend perhaps it is owing to his admiration of you that mine has been engendered. I well recollect 
in the family circle while a boy, sitting around the domestic 
hearth, hearing my father recount your patriotic deeds. One 
sentence from a speech of yours, " The colors that float from the 
mast head should be the credentials of our seamen," was indelibly fixed on my mind. Then judge my deep mortification and 
disappointment to find the sailors' friend, the master-spirit of the 
late war, "the noblest Roman of them all," rejected by the 
American people, and such a man as James K. Polk placed in 
the Presidential chair. Did I say American people ? I recall 
that expression, for two-thirds of the native freemen of the 
United States are your fast friends. Yes, sir, we love you now 
better than ever ; and v/hen the name of Jackson and others of 
your vile traducers shall be forgotten, yours shall be remembered 
and live in the affections of all lovers of liberty. 

It was foreign influence aided by the Irish and Dutch vote 
that caused our defeat. As a proof, in my native city alone, in 
the short space of two months there were over one thousand 
naturalized. Out of this number nine-tenths voted the Locofoco 
ticket. Thus men who could not speak om- language were 
made citizens and became politicians too, who at the polls were 
the noisy revilers of your fair fame thus you have been weU 
rewarded for the interest you ever took for the oppressed of 
other nations. Notwithstanding the ingratitude of the Irish and 
German voters, if the Abolitionists of New York had done theii 
duty, all would have been well. 



WILLIAM D. LEVv'IS TO SIS. CLAY. 

PrnLADELPHiA, November 30, 1844. 

Mv DEAR Friend, After the dreadful battle is over, and, as 1 

believe, most foully won by our opponents, I feel as if it would 

be some relief to my mind to express to you the deep grief with 

which the result has penetrated my heart. I do not class my


OF HENRY OLAY. 511 

self, in this respect, in the general list of your '' hosts of friends" 
throughout the country, for I am sure that, earnestly and truly 
as I know you to be admired and beloved by the best portion of 
your fellow-citizens, there are but a very small number who can 
realize as much sorrow on the present occasion as myself. Not 
that I expected, or had obtruded myself, while success seemed 
certain, into a position to expect, that I should have sought any 
personal benefit from that victory which I hoped and believed 
was about to reward your long and faithful services to your 
country ; but that the kindnesses I had received from you in 
early life had indelibly stamped your image on my heart, and 
that your views of public policy so entirely accorded with the 
dictates of my matured judgment, that I looked to your elevation 
to the Presidency as a great personal delight to myself, and the 
harbinger of long-continued prosperity to the nation. 

This glorious and beneficial result has been prevented through 
wicked and unprincipled men, by frauds upon the elective franchise, as monstrous as they are unprecedented ; by fanaticism 
both religious and political, without a parallel in our history ; 
and by a stolidity on the part of large masses of our population, 
which must go far to convince the most skeptical that there may 
be truth in the apothegm of monarchists, that the people are 
incapable of self-government. 

All is nov/ past. Regrets are unavailing. You will meet the 
untoward event as you have met all the dark hours which have 
preceded it in your eventful hfe with manly fortitude and resignation. And viewing it in a philosophic light, you have, in 
fact, lost nothing. The honor attained would have brought with 
it an accumulation of cares, difficulties, and responsibiliiies ; the 
unreasonable expectations of many of your supporters must have 
been disappointed, and perhaps some of your friendships have 
been thereby embittered. Your reputation as a statesman and 
a patriot remains untouched, or is rendered by the attrition of 
your slanderers even more brilliant, still commanding, as it has 
long commanded, the admiration of the world. Whatever patriotic achievements you might have accomplished in the four 
years to come could have added comparatively little to those of 
the forty years which are gone by. 



A. B. ROMAN TO MR. CLAY. 

Parish of St. James, December 2, 1844. 

Dear Sir, At the very moment that I learned the disastrous 
result of the Presidential contest, I determined to write to you ; 
but I soon perceived that I felt too strongly to express myself 
with any thing like calmness, and on that account I have delayed 
till now to condole with you on our unexpected misfortune. 

To you, personally, I have no consolation to offer. I know 
that you need none, for in your defeat you have lost nothing 
nothing more than I and every other American citizen has lost. 
You have, by your want of success, obtained this advantage, 
that your fellow-citizens may say openly what they think of 
you, without being suspected of interested motives. You have 
done enough for fame ; the station of President could have added 
nothing to yours. The country alone was to have been benefited by your election. When posterity shall wonder that you 
did not obtain the first office in the gift of your countrymen, the 
only answer that can be given must raise you higher than the 
office could ever have done ; it is because " he had rather be 
right than President." 

But what must posterity say of the people of the Union ? 
What are we henceforward to expect from a people, when a 
constitutional majority has been found to reject the Whig doctrines, of which you have always been the representative and 
able interpreter, and to decide in favor of the principles or, 
rather, the want of principles Avith which we have been cursed 
for more than fifteen years? That the majority should sometimes be deceived in the effects and results of abstract theories, 
is nothing more than can be expected from the frailty of human 
nature ; but that they should not form a correct opinion of facts, 
that the distressful experience of fifteen years of demagogueism 
and barefaced corrupiion should not open their eyes, is truly degrading to our national character. Are the hopes which the framers of onr Government have given to the friends of liberty 
throughout the world to end but in a splendid proof of the incapacity of men for self-government ? I begin to fear that it must 
be so, unless we can succeed in the almost hopeless task of retracing some of the destructive steps we have taken ; unless we 
find the means of restoring the lost sanctity of the ballot-box. 
 

DK. MERCER TO MR. CLAY. 

New Ohleans, December "Z, 1844. 

My dear Friend, I received your letter a few days ago, and 
soon after our arrival in town. It was a melancholy pleasure to 
hear from you. 

The late election has mortified and distressed me more than 
I will attempt to express. Your friends are almost without hope, 
while you have consolations in abundance that are denied them. 
No one can deny, that without office or power, you are the first 
man in our country. It was Lord Ormonde, I think, who said 
he preferred his dead Ossary to the living son of any man in Europe. 

I have never before witnessed such disappointment, distress, 
and disgust. The feeling seemed to pervade all classes. I have 
heard men of the opposite faction express their regret at the 
success of their party. A gray-headed man assured me that he 
could not restrain his tears. My own child v/ept bitterly. If, 
as I believe, you prefer reputation to power, and the approbation 
of the victorious and intelligent to the dignity of office, you 
have rather gained than lost by the defeat of your party. I can 
readily understand that you feel more for your country and your 
friends than for yourself. 

Come then among them, my dear friend, you will find none 
elsewhere truer or warmer than those of Mississippi or of this 
place. Among the rest, it will afford me the greatest pleasure 
to see you here, for in this respect I v/ill yield to none of them. 
Your old apartment is ready for you, and every one of the family would feel mortified if you were less at home with us than 
at your own Ashland. 

I have nothing to do, and can foresee no engagement that 
will prevent my accompanying you, wheresoever you may wish 
to go even to Cuba. 

My daughter charges me to present her duty and her love to 
you. The ladies send their most affectionate remembrances. 
May I ask you to present my best respects to Mrs. Clay.

BENJAMIN J. LEEDOM TO MR. CLAY. 

New Tokk, December 20, 1844. 

Esteemed Friend, Although a member of a peaceable Society, who do not profess to take much interest in the political 
contests of the day, yet as a man endowed with the common 
feelings of humanity, and a strong desire for the promotion of 
the best interests of my fellow-man, do T mourn over the dark 
cloud which has overshadowed the political horizon of our beloved country ; the prostration of those high and glorious principles, of which thou hast so long been the great and unwearied 
champion that prostration brought about by fraud and calumny, 
is our country's loss, for I am fully aware that had the victory 
been ours, it could not have added one leaf to the wreath which 
encircles thy brow, 

" For thou art freedom's now, and fame's ; 
One of tbe few, the immortal names 
That are not born to die." 

It is for my country that I mourn, that in thy retirement, one 
of the strongest advocates for those high and glorious principles 
is removed, and I had fondly hoped that, like Cincinnatus, thou 
too, wouldst have left tbe scenes of domestic life, and once 
more have been heard in our legislative balls. The feeling may 
be a selfish one in me, for well I know that it is unreasonable to 
wish to draw thee from thy peaceful abode, into the turbid 
waters of public life again, after so many years of laborious 
toil. 

Happy is he who carries with him into retirement the prayers 
of the patriotic and intelligent of his country these thou hast. 
. 1 My venerated grandsire left the peaceful society of which I 
am a member, to stand by the Father of his country, in the 
dark hour which tried the souls of men. The same feehngs, 
and the same love of country which nerved him to the contest 
in '76, prompted his descendant in '44 to deposit his vote for 
Henry Clay. That vote shall be handed down as an heirloom 
to my children ; although defeated, yet that name will be the 
point around which freemen shall rally, until victory crowns our 
efforts. 

With a sincere prayer that thy days may be long in the land, 
and that peace and happiness may be thine, I remain, etc. 



ADAM BEATTY TO MR. CLAY. 

Prospect Hill, December 24, 1844. 

My dear Sir, The result of the late Presidential election has 
produced on my mind the deepest regret and the most profound 
sorrow. You may well imagine that your failure of success has 
had no small share in exciting these emotions. But it is the 
deep wound inflicted on the honor and best interests of the country, by which I have been most sorely afflicted. Your failure 
has relieved you from a heavy responsibility, and, I doubt not, in 
your retirement at Ashland, you will enjoy more real satisfaction 
than all the honors of the Presidential offlce could afford. It 
will be the means of carrying down to posterity your name with 
greater luster than if you had been elected to the Presidency, 
and I humbly hope that in the wise dispensation of Providence 
your defeat may redound to your temporal and eternal good. 

But oh ! what a wound has been inflicted upon the honor and 
interests of our country ? The election has been carried in favor of Mr. Polk, by the most shameful and abominable frauds 
practiced to an extent which, to every reflecting mind, must 
create the most awful apprehensions as to the future destinies of 
our free institutions, and the perpetuity of the Union. 

But this is not all. The foulest and most unprincipled means 
have been resorted to, and with great success, to excite tlie bitter 
hatred of our recently naturalized citizens, Roman Catholics and 
Abolitionists, against Whig principles, by the grossest and foulest 
misrepresentations, thus setting in hostile array against the great 
conservative principles of the Whig party an embittered faction, 
whose want of intelligence has been played upon to excite to the 
highest degree the ungovernable passions of a considerable portion of our population, 

Reflection upon these circumstances has brought strongly to 
my mind the remark of an eminent modern historian, " That the 
great body of mankind are incapable of judging correctly on 
public affairs." " That the opinion of most men on the great 
questions which divide society, rest on prejudices, personal animosities, and private interests." He consoles his readers by the 
reflection that " truth is in the end triumphant, but it becomes 
predominant only upon the decay of interests, the experience of 
sufieringj or the extinction of passions." 

I greatly fear our country is destined to go through this ordeal, 
great suff"ering she will have to endure, but 1 pray God that truth 
may in the end prevail, and that our Repubhcan institutions may 
yet be saved. 

I have scarcely been able to summon resolution enough to say 
a word to any of my friends, in relation to the arduous contest 
through which the country has recently passed, but I have 
thought a word of consolation, if I were able to aftord it, due to 
our long standing friendship. It aflords me some satisfaction at 
least, under the adverse state of things which exists, to assure 
you of my abiding and cordial esteem and friendship. Permit 
me to add a request that you will present my kindest regards to 
Mrs. Clay. 



E. PETTIGREU TO MR. CLAY. 

Magnolia, Tyrrell County, Noeth Carolina, 
January 1, 1845. 

My dear Sir, The storm is over, and we the people of the 
United States are shipwrecked, and I fear too much damaged 
ever to be repaired. 

The result of the Presidential election was to me perfectly 
astounding, yet for weeks before it, I began to fear, as it is natural for me to look on the dark side of every subject, and I mentioned confidentially to some of my friends that I had apprehensions ; consequently endeavored to prepare my mind for the evil 
day ; that day which in my opinion is the beginning of the end 
of the peace, prosperity, and happiness of this rising country, if 
it did not begin in the year 1829, with the reign of Hickory 
the First. . 
 

My dear sir, on you rested my only hope, to stay the downward tendency of this Government, and at the Court House of 
my county, in a few remarks I made to the people on the day 
of election, I entreated them to do their utmost, to stay that decline, for four years, and it might be that affairs would be put in 
such a train, that misrule would not get the ascendency in four 
years more, and though I felt every thing for the generations to 
come, yet I wished of all things to be gathered to my fathers 
before war, pestilence, and famine should overwhelm the land. 
We did well in the county in which I live, and I feel proud to 
know that the State of North Carolina is numbered among the 
Law and Order party, though differing with so many of its neighboring States. 

The malcontents of these United States have given the great 
est blow to elective Government that ever was given. It has 
shown to the best friends of republican Governments that demagogues, who without principle and without honesty, to answer 
party and selfish purposes will rake the pit for voters, as in this 
case, and thereby drive from office those who could save the 
country and put in their stead a ihird-rate man. Yea, a no-rate 
man. Such men from want of capacity to manage the affairs 
of Government must submit to the dictation of artful, designing, dishonest, and irresponsible men, and every department of 
the Government must necessarily run into anarchy and confusion. 

But on this subject I need say no more. It is all plain to you, 
and my remarks are only to show how much I deplore the failure of our forefathers, the patriots of the Revolution. But one 
word on the subject of naturalization. My opinion has been for 
forty years that there should be no citizens of the United States 
except those born within its limits. Let every foreigner be satisfied to enjoy all the other privileges that the State in which 
they chose to live thought proper to grant. Had that been the 
law, we should not now be like men in a thunder squall wait 
ing with trembling anxiety for the next clap. 

My dear sir, I must say that I feel very much for your disappointment in being prevented, by corruption, after more than 
forty years of devotion to your country's good, from doing to it 
the greatest service that could fall to the lot of any man. We 
all need deplore the circumstance as a national calamity; but 
from you, there is removed a great weight of responsibility, and 
you now rest under a perfect knowledge that you retire into 
private life with the highest honors that can fall to any man 
now living, the confidence, esteem, and love of hundreds of 
thousands of those of your fellow-citizens who know yon best. 

N. B. I omitted to mention, that in 1829, I was unreserved in 
saying that I gave this United States Government thirty years 
to continue ; which has been my unwavering opinion and declaration up to this time, and I fear my time will be found too 
long, and I further fear that God has given us up as unworthy 
of his care and protection, and to a hard heart and reprobate 
mind, at all events politically. 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 4, 1845. 

Dear Sir, Commodore Jesse D. Elliot has committed to my 
charge, to be transmitted to you, a bronze medal, which he has 
caused to be struck in honor of Mr. J. Fenimore Cooper, as a 
tribute of gratitude for Mr. Cooper's defense and vindication of 
the Commodore's character with reference to certain charges 
which have been brought before the Republic against him. 
Commodore Elliot proposes to distribute a limited number of 
these medals to certain distinguished persons, and to some of his 
personal friends, and then to have the die broken. I take pleasure in executing his commission, by forwarding herewith the medal to you. 

I have yet to acknowledge the receipt of a very kind and 
friendly letter from you, written shortly before the unexpected 
and inauspicious issue of the recent Presidential election. It 
has been on many accounts painful to me ; but on none more, 
or so much, as on the dark shade which it has cast upon our 
prospects of futurity. I had hoped that under your guidance 
the country would have recovered from the downward tendency 
into which it has been sinking. But the glaring frauds by 
which the election was consummated, afford a sad presentiment 
of what must be expected hereafter. 

We must hope that a merciful Providence will yet preside 
over the destinies of our country, and avert the calamities with 
which she is threatened. 
 

That your personal comforts may be multiplied in proportion 
to the weight of cares which a diilerent issue would have 
brought upon you is the fervent wish of, dear sir, your friend 
and faithful servant. 


B. JOHNSON BARBOUR TO MR. CLAY. 

Baebouksville, February, 16 1845. 

My dear Sir, It has long been my wish to address you a 
letter, but I have been deterred until now by the fear that you 
were already too much wearied by an extensive correspondence. 
Nor had I the heart to dwell upon the subject which lay uppermost in my thoughts. I could not sit down calmly to speak of 
an event trifling to yourself, but portentous to the nation. 

Permit me, Mr. Clay, to say that my affection for you, based 
upon a love of all that is bright and noble in human nature, is 
not the growth of a day. I claim the privilege of speaking as 
an original Whig, as one baptized in the faith at the fountain, as 
one who was taught to love the Whig cause when he knew no 
better, and who never knows nothing better than to love it. My 
love for its great representative was coeval. In my earliest youth 
I was taught by him who was your constant friend to honor the 
pure statesman and patriot pursued by calumny, but still laboring 
with undiminished ardor for an ungrateful country. I felt then 
that, when the vile passions and prejudices of the day had passed 
away, you would have your merited reward from an approving posterity ; that your memory would be cherished when the 
demagogues who traduced you were 

"Forgotten as fools, or remembered as -worse;" 

that you would be hailed as the wondrous architect that had 
strengthened and adorned the noble edifice whose foundation was 
won by the valor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and whose corner-stone was 
laid by the wisdom of Madison. 
 

A brighter day seemed at length to have dawned upon the Republic. The nation seemed at length to have awakened to its 
true interests, and in the Presidential contest of 1844 I fondly 
looked forward to the confusion of your enemies, your complete 
justification, and the firm re-establishment of our great conservative cause. In this we have been sadly mistaken. Double-dealing, defamation and slanders are still omnipotent. A motley 
party, without principle or principles, with fraud for the means 
and tlie election of a demagogue for the end, have triumphed. 
Domestic corruption and foreign putrescence coalesced to overwhelm the virtue and honesty of the country. Plaquemine and 
Tammany have stifled the voice of the American people, and the 
late contest has only established the melancholy facts that frauds 
upon the ballot box have perfect impunity, that mediocrity is 
merit, and that every excess may be committed in the name of a 
spurious Democracy. 

This is a mournful spectacle for the patriot, and it is perhaps 
better for your fame that you were not called upon to wage an 
ineffectual and unavailing contest with the corruption which pervades every part of the body politic. But little pleasure could 
be felt by the President of a nation where Dorr found mourners, 
disunion advocates ; where a lust of territory overrides every 
principle of law, all fear of consequence, and all sense of justice ; 
where rebellion puts the power of a State at defiance, and repudiation grows, prospers, and exults. Such are the terrible 
symptoms by which we are surrounded, telling of the decay of 
virtue and honor, the only safeguard of a Republic. 

These are sad and gloomy thoughts, you will say, for one so 
young. God grant I may be mistaken, that better things may 
be in store for us, that the time may return v/hen patriotism will 
be no crime, nor long service a subject of reproach. 

As an humble member of the Whig party I shall never cease 
to lift my voice against the foes of my country, that I may have 
something at least of that proud consolation which is yours, tiie 
consciousness that every nerve was strained and nothing left undone to a,vert the final catastrophe. 

My mother desires to be most kindly remembered to yourself 
and Mrs, Clay. 


JOHN R. THOMPSON TO MR. CLAY. 

Umvkksitt of Virginia, April 8, 1845. 

My dear Sir, Allow me to say that in venturing to offer 
the expression of my condolence, where condolence is doubtless 
inapposite, as the result of the late Presidential election, I do so 
as an original Whig, as a native of that '• Gibraltar of Whig principles," the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, v/hich has always stood up nobly 
for you through good and evil report, and where, forty-five years 
ago, in the office of Chancellor Wythe, you laid the imperishable 
foundations of that greatness, which has since overshadowed the 
world. Your own generous Kentucky has not been more faithful to your fortunes. I trust, therefore, that you will recognize 
my right, as a citizen of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and as one who gave with 
honest pride his first vote for you, to lament the disaster that has 
befallen us. 

I had fondly looked forward to November, 1844, as the day 
when the people of our beloved country would assert their longviolated rights, when the malevolence of a vile herd of defamatory enemies would be silenced forever, when a Republic, ceasing to be ungrateful, would reward, with the highest office in 
its gift, the man who of all others had deserved it. I can not 
tell you, sir, the sense of desolation and crushed hopes with 
which the painful intelligence of your defeat was received. 
Frauds, the most infamous in the annals of the elective franchise, 
stified the voice of the people, and national disgrace was eflected 
by a motley party of Dorrites and Agrarians, Mormons and Repudiators, the voters of Plaquemine and the outlaws of the Empire Club. Since their ill-omened success, this party have already 
commenced the work of destruction, and we have, but a few 
weeks since, seen the plainest provisions of our blessed Constitution set at naught, in the passage of the Texas bill. There 
is, indeed, a dark pall over the prospect before us when that 
sacred instrument can be trampled upon by peculation and 
cupidity. 

For yourself, personally, the present age may not accord you 
 

justice. But I feel assured that a time will come, and I trust 
in God I may live to see it, when the passions and prejudices 
of the present state have passed away, and your stainless and 
splendid name will be revered by an admiring posterity. 

The patriotic exertions of the women of Virginia to erect a 
statue in commemoration of your virtues, can not have escaped 
your attention. I take pleasure in stating to you that I was yesterday informed by Mrs. Lucy Barbour, the venerable and distinguished lady, who gave to the work its first impulse, that 
success is certain, and that next summer the corner-stone will be 
laid. We will erect it upon our Capitol Square, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
and it shall bear some such inscription as was once applied to 
Charles James Fox, a character, in many respects, kindred with 
your own : 

"A patriot's even course he steered, 

'Mid faction's wildest storms unmoved, 
By all who marked his course, revered, 
By all who knew his heart, beloved.'" 

Inclosed you will find a copy of some poor verses that I ^vTOtG 
for Mr. Pleasants on the occasion of Christmas, in which is atattempted a satire on the follies of the age. I hope you Avill not 
deem it impertinent if I ask that you will do me the honor to 
read them. 



DOCTOR BIERCER TO SIR. CLAY. 

New Orleans, April 22, 1845. 

My very dear Friend, I have received here your kind letter 
from Natchez, whence it v/as forwarded. We have been detained by Miss Young's indisposition, now of several months duration, and by her desire to enjoy the benefit of Lugenburg's 
advice. But as she is now much relieved, I indulge the hope of 
returning home next week. 

In regard to your affairs^ or rather to a late movement on the 
part of your friends, however reluctant I might be on ordinary 
occasions to hazard one, conscious of its little authority, yet I 
have not the slighest hesitation to express my opinion as the case 
appears a very plain one. 

I learn from your letter that certain of your debts have been 
cancelled at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> by some unknown and inscrutable agency, 
that you suspect the interposition of your friends, and that you 
are somewhat doubtful whether it would not be more consistent 
with the independence of your previous life that you should reject the kindly office thus proffered. 

Now in all ages signal public services have been rewarded by 
national benefactions. In our own day, Sieyes and Wellington have had grants of domains, the debts of Pitt have been 
paid by Parliament, Fox did not disdain the assistance of his 
friends. Your memory will furnish innumerable other instances. 
If Republics are ungrateful it is the more necessary that private 
individuals should perform the duty neglected by the public authorities. 

You have devoted more than forty years of your life to public 
afiairs, and have rendered the most important public services. If, 
in this distinguished career, you have acquired fame surpassing 
that of your cotemporaries, it is equally true, that the same capacity, industry and zeal, would have insured to you the most 
ample fortune. This, it strikes me, is the true view of the case, 
and is conclusive beyond question, as you would also think if you 
were not interested. 

But there is another aspect. Would it not be ungracious to 
repel the friendly hand that is tendered, to mortify those who are 
warmly attached to you, and to consult shall I venture on the 
word ? your pride, at the expense of their feelings ? 

My dear friend, you must submit, there is no remedy ; for, if 
your suspicions are correct, you can not overcome the precautions 
which may have been adopted to guard against this very contingency. 

I venture to use the language which is dictated alike by my 
grateful sense of your sentiments toward me, as by my high respect and warm attachment for you. Most surely it is the duty 
of a friend to speak plainly, without, however, disregarding the 
delicacy aud courtesy which are equally necessary. 

I hope Mrs. Clay has not forgotten me, and that she will accept my respects. 


A GOLD PEN TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, 8 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> Square, July 12, 1845. 

Honored and honorable Sir, Designed by my maker for 
actual service, and ambitious to hold a situation where I can gain 
the highest honor, and confer the greatest benefit on mankind, I 
am emboldened, at the suggestion of a friend, to present myself 
before you, to solicit your patronage and favor. 

Truth compels me to admit that I have but little to recommend 
me to your notice. Although I derive my origin from a rich and 
powerful family, to whom even princes pay court, and whose influence is felt throughout the world, I am myself without influence, without the attraction of peculiar beauty, am worth but 
little money, and wholly destitute of intellectual endowments. 
Yet, kind sir, if you will take me by the hand and admit me to 
your intimate companionship, to your treasury of thoughts, I 
shall soon become familiar with all that is noble in sentiment, 
lofty in conception, wise in judgment, beautiful in imagery, honest in purpose, and truthful in expression. 

Thus guided I can not fail to impart pleasure and instruction 
to the world ; and to gain in return, the ^yorld's admiration and 
applause. 

Insignificant as I may appear in comparison with such of my 
elegant relations as have lately been presented to you, I yet hope 
you will deign to listen to my application, will give me a place 
near your person, and allow me to remain, honored sir, ever 
yours to command. 


HENRY WHITE AND OTHERS TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, December 21, 1845. 

Dear Sir, The undersigned, acting for the Whigs of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, have the honor to ask your acceptance of the book 
which accompanies this letter. It contains an expression of 
gratitude from your Whig brethren here, for your eminent services as a statesman, and a testimonial of their regard for you, 
as a citizen and friend. 

The undersigned have the honor to send with the book a casket of jewels, manufactured in this city for Mrs. Clay. On behalf of the ladies and gentlemen whose names are contained in 
the book, they present them to Mrs. Clay, as a mark of their 
high consideration and respect for the worth and virtues of the 
lady of one to whom the country owes a debt of gratitude that 
never can be repaid. 


LORD MORPETH TO MR. CLAY. 

Castle Howard, April 17, 1846. 

My dear Mr. Clay, I should hardly have ventured to put 
the locality of my date into so graphic a form, but I thought 
that if your Yorkshire housekeeper should be still alive, she 
might like to be shown the outside of a Yorkshire house. I 
wish I could show her master the inside. The reason for my 
breaking in at all upon the repose. of Ashland (a repose, however, 
against the cause of which I protest in common with the sound 
sense of mankind at large), is to satisfy the request of a friend, 
who begs me to inquire from you whether you happen to know 
any thing of a Mr. William Cavendish, whom he believes to 
have accompanied you upon your return to America in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1815">1815</a>16(?)j and if so, what befell him, whether he is still alive, and 
what he is now doing. I sincerely beg pardon for inflicting so 
much old-dated curiosity upon you, and it is only in respect of 
having once discharged the office of your letter-carrier, that I 
can hope to be excused for bothering your post-bag with so uninteresting an inquiry. The last mail brings us the account of 
your adding to your estimates, but I hope that the whole matters between us wear a more pacific complexion. I must say 
that I think upon our side there would be a sincere aversion to 
any conflict between us. I am afraid I must not bespeak your 
sympathy for our Free-Trade movement. It rather hangs fire 
during its progress through the Legislature, but I am inclined to 
believe that the House of Lords will pass the bill. I hope your 
groves are flourishing round you, and I must particularly inquire 
after your stock of cattle. We are rather proud of our breed in 
this place, and sold two short-horned cows last autumn for 
£300, which in the present times we consider a large price, 
when good breeds are become so much more common. I would 
beg to be kindly remembered to all of your family who are 
good enough to retain any recollection of me. I wonder whether 
your servant Charles is still with you ? 

Mr. Denison, whom you may remember as a traveler in America some twenty years ago, is now with us here, and begs to be 
recalled to your recollection. 


WM. PRESTON AND OTHERS TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, April 10, 1847. 

Dear Sir, The people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, deeply moved by the 
circumstances attending the battle of Buena Vista, and wishing 
to manifest their profound esteem for the brave men who fell on 
that memorable day, adopted a series of resolutions expressive 
of their feelings at the reception of the mournful, yet glorious 
intelligence. A copy of those resolutions have been inclosed to 
you by a committee appointed for that purpose. 

To the undersigned this sad yet grateful duty was allotted of 

making the requisite arrangements to bring back to this State 
the remains of the brave officers and soldiers from this city, who, 
on that day, died in the service of the nation. 

Among those who perished on that sanguinary battle-field, 
you, sir, sustained the loss of a brave and gallant son a loss as 
afflicting to his country as to his kindred. To the city of his 
adoption he was endeared in life by many virtues, and the sad 
story of his unyielding valor and chivalric death, will long be remembered and treasured by her sons. We will not venture to 
dwell upon a theme so painful, yet so full of consolation to a 
father's heart ; our duty is simpler. It is for us to bring back 
his last remains from the land of the foeman and stranger, that 
he may peacefully repose in the bosom of his own loved Kentucky, far indeed from the field of his glory, but amid hearts that 
knew, that loved, that honored him. 

It is to ask your permission to bring back to his native State 
the body of Colonel Clay, to administer the last sacred rites of 
sepulture, and afterward to erect a monument to commemorate 
his virtues and perpetuate his deeds, that we address this note. 

We remain, sir, with the profoundest sympathy for your affliction, and with the highest esteem, your friends and fellow-citizens. 


NICHOLAS dean TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, August 12, 1847. 
My dear Sir, Three years have elapsed since I last had the 
honor of addressing you ; not that the abiding feelings of respect 
and admiration with which I regard you have in any degree diminished, but the fervent hopes entertained by me, in common 
with millions of your fellow-citizens, were so unexpectedly and 
fatally crushed by the issue of the last Presidential election, that 
I have never yet been able perfectly to rally from its stunning effects, or to gather confidence enough to force myself upon your attention. 

A calamity of a different and infinitely more afflicting character has since fallen upon your family circle, awakening the 
sympathies and calling forth the commisseration of all those who 
have hearts to feel throughout our native country ; in these, 
my dear sir, I deeply and truly participate, and respectfully 
tender to you, and those dear to you, my heartfelt condolements. 

Among the numerous tributes which the gallantry and noble 
bearing of your lamented son upon the fatal field of Buena 
Vista have called forth, I have met none more touching in its 
inception and character than the one herewith inclosed, the* production of Frances Jane Crosby, a resident graduate of the New 
York Institution for the Blind. It was written immediately 
after the announcement of his fall in that fearful conflict. The 
authoress but recently recited it to me, and I hasten to place it 
before you. 

The deep, broad current of universal sorrow has forced the 
barriers that encompass the blind, and awakened sympathies 
even in their stricken state of darkness and solitude. 

I can not add to the tenderness and pathos of such an offering. 
Accept it, I pray you. 

On the death of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Clay, Jr., who fell at the battle of Suena 
Vista, Mexico, February 23, 1847, by Frances Jane Crosby,* of the New York Institute for the Blind, 

Lo ! on the gory battle-field, 

A soldier brave is lying, 
Mild is the luster of his eye, 

Though he, alas ! is dying. 

Yet still with feeble hand he grasps 

The sword so faithful ever ; 
Now drops the weapon by his side, 

And to resume it never. 

Oh ! gallant Clat, though for thy brow 

Its laurels Fame is weaving ; 
Vain trophies ! for thy bosom now 

Its last faint sigh is heaving. 

Back, cowards ! would ye deeper make 

The wounds already given ? 
You, from an aged father's heart 

Another tie have riven. 

* Miss Crosby has been blind since the age of six weeks. 
 

Intrepid warrior, thou hast left 

A deathless name behind thee 
That name unsullied, still shall shine, 

Thougli the dark grave may bind thee. 

Thou, by thy General's side hast fought, 

Yes, Taylor -will deplore thee ; 
And many a heart that shared thy love 
"Will weep in silence o'er thee ! 



E. C. WINES TO MR. CLAY. 

TuE Oaklands School, near Burlington, 
N"ew Jersey, August 16, 184Y. 

Dear Sir, In the late severe affliction, through which a 
mysterious but doubtless ever-wise and benignant Providence has 
called you to pass, 1 have felt the deepest sympathy with you. 
And if I have not given utterance to these emotions, it was only 
because I feared that my condolence would be rather an intrusion upon your grief than any alleviation of it. Having recently 
seen, however, an account in the public papers of your baptism, 
whereby you have become a member of the visible Church of 
Christ, I can not refrain from conveying to you my cordial congratulations on the auspicious issue of your sorrowful bereavement. It was the experience of one of the greatest monarchs 
and statesmen the world ever saw ; it has been the experience 
of thousands in every condition of life since his day ; it has 
now, I trust, become your happy experience also : " It is good 
for me that I have been afflicted." The hand of affliction is 
heavy, but it is because it is fflled with gold ; the voice of affliction is stern, but its wounds are the probings of a -skillful 
chirurgeon ; the countenance of affliction is lowering, but it is the 
frown of a parent, soon to be followed by the serene and radiant 
smile of unclouded affection. 

Yours, my dear sir, has been a life of incident, of stir, of agitation, of heroic doing and suffering. You have often been 
placed in positions where your self-possession, your wisdom, 
your calm energy, and your noble heroism have awakened the 
admiration of all beholders. But never, on any other occasion, 
have you displayed so true a wisdom, or appeared invested with 
so sublime a dignity, as when receiving the baptismal waters, 
and seated at the communion-table of our common Lord. 

I remember well the anguish you suffered a few years ago, 
under the loss of an estimable and beloved daughter. I remember also your declaration that Mrs. Clay, though deeply distressed, was yet amply sustained and solaced by her religion, 
and the earnest expression of your wish that you had the same 
source of consolation, and of your hope that you some day 
should possess it. From that time to the present I have felt a 
deep interest in your religious state and welfare, and a belief 
that you would at length find the treasure you desired a part 
in the purchased blessings of the Gospel. And such, I hope, is 
now the case, and that you find in this the heaviest affliction of 
your life the loss of a talented, generous, and chivalrous son 
all the consolation which the Gospel is fitted to bestow, and assuredly does bestow, upon all who cordially embrace it. For 
what can religion be worth, if there is not more in God to comfort us than there can be in the loss of any, even the dearest 
and most cherished, of his creatures, to distress us ? 

Can you not pass a day or two with us at the Oaklands, when 
on your way to New York ? We are quite in the country, being two miles distant from Burlington ; have an elevated and 
airy situation, and are surrounded by venerable forest-trees, 
whose grateful shade defends us, even in the height of summer, 
from the scorching heats of the sun. 

When you write to your son John, be pleased to convey to 
him the expression of my warm regard and friendship. Mrs. 
Wines desires to be respectfully presented to you. 



GENERAL TAYLOR TO MR. CLAY. 

Head Quarters, Army of Occupation, 

Camp near Mouterej, November 4, 1847. 

My dear Sir, By yesterday's mail I had the gratification of 
receiving your very welcome letter of the 27th September. Rest 
assured that nothing has transpired, nothing can transpire, to 
impair the amicable and kindly relations which it has been my 
pleasure and pride for so long time to maintain with you. 
Hints, similar to those to which you refer, have been thrown 
out in letters which I have recently received j but they have 
had no influence whatever upon me ; not one word has served, 
 

in the remotest degree, to prejudice me against yourself or your 
friends, in either personal or political relations. 

I fu]ly agree with you in the necessity for more deliberation 
in the selection of a candidate for the Presidency, and I truly 
regret that my name should have been used in that relation. It 
has been permitted with the greatest reluctance on my part, and 
only from a sense of duty to the country. My repugnance to 
being a candidate before the nation for that exalted office has 
been frankly and sincerely made known. Most truly is it my 
hope that before next November the party may select a Whig 
in all respects worthy of the confidence of the country. To a 
mutual friend of ours I have recently made this announcement, 
asserting my greater desire for the quiet of private occupations, 
as not only a more appropriate termination to my services as a 
soldier, and more consonant with my earnest wishes, but particularly proper in reference to my limited acquaintance with matters of civil and national polity. I stated to him specifically 
that I was ready to stand aside, if you or any other Whig were 
the choice of the party, and that I sincerely hoped such might 
be their decision. 

The importance of harmony and good feeling among the opponents of the present dynasty, is by no one appreciated more 
considerately than by myself, and whatever may be the decision 
of the party, I shall be studiously guarded in this particular, and 
strive to lend my best endeavors to the preservation of unity. 

Permit me to repeat, that whatever representations may be 
made to me, from any source, conveying any expression of disrespect tcv/ard yourself or your friends, or that either entertain 
unfriendly feelings toward me, be assured, my dear sir, they 
will be repelled and discredited, as they justly merit. 

I am much rejoiced that I have this opportunity to assure you, 
not only of my frank and full confidence in your friendship and 
kindly feelings, but that I warmly appreciate your wishes for 
my own success, and your expressed desire to contribute to it. 

With my cordial assurance that what is herein written is dictated by the same candid and friendly spirit, so evident in your 
own letter, I subscribe myself, most sincerely and faithfully, 
your friend. 


WILLIAIM C. PRESTON TO MR. CLAY. 

Columbia, JNTovember 28, 184'7. 

My dear Sir, Your speech* is not only equal to your reputation, but in my judgment even passes what you have heretofore 
done. The eloquence with which you have expressed yourself 
gave me delight, while the dignity, wisdom and lofty spirit of 
patriotism throughout it inspire me with a sort of awe, and fill 
me with solemn emotions. It is a very noble State paper. It 
gave me the more profound satisfaction as it had been preceded 
by rumors of a different character. I can not but believe that 
it will be of great value to the country, and arrest the fatal policy which is hurrying us to the most disastrous consequences. 



GENERAL TAYLOR TO MR. CLAY. 

Baton Rouge, La., December 28, 184:1. 

My DEAR Sir, Your kind and acceptable letter of the 13th 
instant, congratulating me on my safe return to the United 
States, and for the complimentary and flattering terms you have 
been pleased to notice my services, I beg leave to tender you 
my sincere thanks. 

* On the Mexican War, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. 
 

The warm and hearty reception I have met with from so 
many of my fellow-citizens, where I have mingled among them 
since my return, in addition to their manifestations of their high 
appreciation and approval of my conduct while in Mexico, has 
been truly gratifying, and has ten-fold more than compensated 
me for the dangers and toils I have encountered in the public 
service, as well as for the privations in being so long separated 
from my family and friends ; yet there are circumstances connected with my operations in that country which I can never 
forget, and which I must always think of with feelings of the 
deepest sorrow and regret. 

I left Mexico after it was determined the column under my 
orders was to act on the defensive, and after the capital of the 
enemy had fallen into our hands, and their army dispersed, on a 
short leave of absence, to visit my family, and to attend to some 
important private affairs, which could not well be arranged without my being present, and which had been too long neglected. 
After reaching New Orleans, I informed the Secretary of War 
that should my presence in Mexico be deemed necessary at any 
time, I was ready to return, and that a communication on that or 
any other subject connected with my public duties would reach 
me if addressed to this place. I therefore feel bound to remain 
here, or in the vicinity, until the proper authorities at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> determine what disposition is to be made of or with me. 
Under this state of things I do not expect to have it in my 
power to visit Kentucky, although it would afford me much real 
pleasure to mix once more with my numerous relatives and 
friends in that patriotic State, to whom I am devotedly attached ; 
as well as again to visit, if not the place of my nativity, where 
I was reared from infancy to early manhood. And let me assure 
you I duly appreciate your kind invitation to visit you at your 
own hospitable home, and should any thing occur which will 
enable me to avail myself of it, I will embrace the opportunity 
with much real pleasiu:e. 

I regret to say, I found my family, or rather Mrs. Taylor, on 
my return, in feeble health, as well as my affairs in any other 
than a prosperous condition ; the latter was, however, to be expected, and I must devote what time I can spare, or can be 
be spared from my public duties, in putting them in order as far 
as I can do so. 

Should circumstances so turn out as will induce you to visit 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> the present winter, I trust you will take every precaution to protect yourself while traveling from the effects of 
the severe cold weather you must necessarily encounter in crossing the mountains, particularly so after having passed several of 
the last winters in the South. 

The letter which you did me the honor to address me, referred 
to, reached me on the eve of my leaving Monterey to return to 
the United States, and was at once replied to, which reply I 
flatter myself reached you shortly after writing your last communication ; in which I stated, although I had received some 
letters from individuals in Kentucky calculated, or perhaps intended, to produce unkind feelings on my part toward you, even 
admitting such was the case, their object has not been accomplished in the slightest degree, and I hope it will never be the 
case. 

Please present me most kindly to your excellent lady, and 
wishing you and yours continued health and prosperity, I remain, with respect and esteem, etc. 


JOHN M'LEAN to MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, March 1, 1848. 

My dear Sir, Your favor from Baltimore was lately received 
at this place, it having been forwarded to me by Mr. Botts. 

The manifestations of confidence and afiection by your fellow-citizens in your late tour must be gratifying to you, as they 
certainly have been to your friends. No higher honors could be 
bestowed than those which you have received. 

No one can so fully understand and appreciate the importance 
of your position, as connected with the future, as yourself ; and 
this knowledge best qualifies you to determine your course of 
action. Standing in the advance of all your compeers in age 
and in renown, you owe much to yourself. But your fame is 
not exclusively yomr own. It belongs also to the nation. No 
one friendly to his country could desire a step to be taken or 
 

omitted by you, which might not result, as it would be designed, for the general good. 

You can not be insensible to the claims of duty, but your 
friends have no right to expect from you personal sacrifices. I 
can only repeat what I said to you in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, that if, on a 
full view of the whole ground, your friends believe, and your 
own judgment shall concur with theirs, that there exists the 
highest probability of success, you ought not to withhold your 
name. But, in all frankness, I will say that you ought not to 
enter into a doubtful contest. Your fame is of too much value 
to yourself and to your country to compromise it, in any degree, 
on a hazardous result. 

Political success is no longer a test of merit or qualification. 
Had this been otherwise, you would long since have been at the 
head of the Government. If your name shall be brought before 
the country, with your assent, I shall feel the utmost solicitude 
for your success. 



GENEBAL TAYLOR TO MR. CLAY. 

Baton Eouge, La., April 30, 1848. 
My dear Sir, Your highly esteemed letter of the 4th inst. 
v/as duly received, for which you have my best thanks. It was 
highly gratifying to me to hear from you, and to learn you had 
returned to Ashland, after so long a travel during the most inclement season of the year, in good health, which, I flatter myself, you will long continue to enjoy. Your views, as regards 
our respective chances to succeed to the Presidency at the coming election, are entitled to the greatest respect and consideration, 
as your opportunities of knowing the opinion of the people generally throughout the country, as regards that matter, are much 
better than mine can possibly be, having recently made a visit 
to the seat of the General Government, to three or four of our 
largest cities, and passed through, into, and along the borders of 
several of the strongest States in the Union ; while I have, since 
my return from Mexico, for the most part remained stationary at 
an out-of-the-way place, where I see or hear but little of political movements or matters, save through the newspapers and letters, for the most part written and published by politicians, the 
editors and writers of the same are sometimes mistaken in their 
views on the subject of President- making, as other people. 

I conceive I am, owing to circumstances which I could not 
well avoid, placed in rather a peculiar situation, as regards my 
being a candidate for the Presidency. It is well known to 
those who had my confidence, that I was very much opposed, 
when the matter was first agitated in several of the public journals, which was soon after the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca 
de la Palma, to my name being used as a candidate for that 
office, which I resisted as far as I could well do so, stating to 
those around me that I had no aspii-ations for civil office of any 
kind ; that my greatest ambition was to bring the war we were 
engaged in to a speedy and honorable termination ; that by being considered a candidate for that situation, would have the 
effect to make the President hostile to me even without his being aware of it, and in such a way as to impair my usefulness 
in the field, if not to destroy it, as regarded the object I had 
nearest my heart, which has been realized to the full extent of 
my expectation ; for ever since the battle of Monterey, until 
I left Mexico, the hand of the Executive was laid heavily on 
me. 

My name continued to be constantly referred to through some 
of the newspapers, from the time previously mentioned, as a 
candidate for the Presidency, until the battle of Buena Vista, 
soon after which I began to receive many letters from some of 
the first political men of the nation, and from several States, in 
which they stated that it was in contemplation to bring my 
name before the country as the Whig candidate for the Presidency, in November, 1848. In reply, I frankly stated my objections to their doing so ; among others, that I was no politician, and that it might be considered presumption in me to 
aspire to that high station, when there were such statesmen who 
might be elevated to it as yourself, Mr. Crittenden, Judge 
McLean, and John M. Clayton, and hundreds of others unknown 
to me, who were, I conceived, much better qualified to preside 
over the destinies of the country than I was ; that you were my 
first choice, nor did I wish to be in the way of any prominent 
Whig who might be brought out for that office. To v/hich they 
replied some of whom were your warm political and personal 
friends that you would not again permit your name to be 
brought before the country as a candidate, and that they did not 
believe any other Whig, owing to events which had taken 
place, was so likely to be elected, in opposition to the party in 
 

power, as myself ; and that I owed it to the country to permit 
my name to be used for said object ; that I " could not avoid 
being a candidate if I would, and ought not if I could." Under 
this state of things I reluctantly yielded to their wishes. About 
the same time, I informed a distinguished member of Congress, 
that the arrangements for the next Presidential campaign were to 
be made during the approaching session of that body, which would 
shortly meet ; and if, after consulting the members of both branches 
of the same, it was thought advisable to take up some other individual of the party who was more available, he was authorized 
to withdraw my name from the contest, and if it was you who 
was fixed on, so much the better. After writing said letter, I 
received the proceedings of the people called together in primary 
assemblies in several of the States, nominating me as a candidate for the Presidency at the next election, and in several instances stating it was understood that, in the event of any distinguished Whig being brought out as a candidate, I would at 
once withdraw my name ; but urging me not to do so, but to continue as a candidate under all circumstances, on the grounds I 
had taken, which was not to be the exclusive candidate of any 
party, etc. ; and on reaching New Orleans many friends called 
on me to let it be publicly announced that my name as a candidate for the office in question would not be withdrawn, let who 
would be in the field, which I consented to, and advised my 
friends in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> of my change in that respect, without 
delay. I therefore now consider myself in the hands of the 
people, a portion of whom have placed my name before the 
country, for the highest office in their gift, without any agency 
of mine in the matter, and if they should think proper to drop 
me and take another, which they ought to do, provided they 
can fix on a more available candidate, and one better qualified 
to serve them, and cast their votes for him at the proper time, 
and should succeed in electing him, it will neither be a source 
of mortification or disappointment to me. On the contrary, if 
he is honest, truthful, and patriotic, I will rejoice at the result. 
And I can say, in all sincerity, that should you receive the nomination of the Whig National Convention, which is to meet in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> in June, and should be elected in November, but 
few of your friends will be more gratified than myself. And 
should you be unsuccessful, and should it be thought your being 
a candidate had the eflfect of preventing my election, it will not 

produce the slightest feehng of unkindness toward you, but I 
will continue to cherish those kind feelings which I have entertained for you for many years, which I hope are reciprocal. 



CHARLES F. ADAMS TO MR. CLAY. 

Quincy, May 24, 1848. 

My DEAR Sir, On behalf of my mother and the few surviving relatives of my late father, as well as for myself, permit me 
to express the sense which I entertain of the kindness expressed 
in your letter of the 15th instant. Much as the sympathy has 
been which the painful event to which you are pleased to allude 
has called out from almost all quarters, from none could it have 
come more gratefully than from yourself. A kind providence 
had by a preceding warning in a measure prepared me to expect 
the blow, but I confess I was wholly unprepared for so deep and 
general a manifestation of the public regard. Besides the soothing influence of this result to the feelings of those immediately 
connected with him, I trust, it may have a wider bearing to 
prove to all that class of statesmen of which you as well as he 
are a prominent example, that the most vehement opposition of 
rivals and cotemporaries,. though attended with temporary success, avails little to cloud the deliberate judgment of a later time. 

Suffer me, sir, most respectfully to reciprocate the good will 
which you are pleased to express toward myself. I have always 
looked back with pleasure to the days in which as a very young 
man I had some extraordinary opportunities of acquaintance with 
the most distinguished men of the country. I have never been 
anxious to alloy the impressions obtained in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> at that 
period with new ones to be found in the later society of that 
capital. Had the statesmen of that day continued to guide the 
destinies of the country, its prospects at this time would have 
been somewhat different from what they are. But the die is cast 



DAVID GRAHAM TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, June 9, 1848.
 
My dear Sir, The mis-representatives of the Whig party 
have at length consummated the greatest act of national injustice it v/as in their power to perform, in the nomination of a man 
as their candidate for the Presidency who has rejected the principles and spurned the organization and discipline of the Whigs. 
The intelligence has fallen upon the honest and true-hearted 
Whigs of this city, and I doubt not of the country at large, like 
a clap of thunder ; and the execrations of the mass of the party 
here, at the treachery by which they have again been overtaken, 
are both loud and deep. For yourself, my dear sir, it will be 
gratifying to know that this last act of ingratitude has only 
served to bind you more closely to the hearts of your friends ; 
and I do but justice to theii; feelings and my own when I say 
that a signal, and I trust, withering rebuke will be promptly administered to the stock-jobbing politicians for whose selfish purposes this outrage upon us has been perpetrated. To you no 
station can bring higher honor than that which you now enjoy ; 
and, so far as you are individually concerned, it is not too much 
to say that an honorable retirement, accompanied with the heartfelt affection of the whole nation, must be more grateful than 
the turmoil and anxieties attendant upon office, however exalted. 
But it can not and will not be forgotten, that in your person the 
integrity and the hopes of the Whig party have been stricken 
down, and their existence as a party blasted and destroyed. And 
I trust the day is far distant when a forgiveness will be extended 
to the base combination between the heartless rivals whom you 
have outstripped, both in unexampled devotion to your country 
and in the favor of your countrymen, and the truckling harpies, 
who, hke the followers of a camp, are bent upon plunder alone. 

I know, my dear sir, that you will indulge in no personal regrets at the issue. But at the same time, allow me, as one of 
your truest friends, as one who from the moment when I was invested with the right to express an opinion upon public affairs, 
have been a Whig, and a Clay Whig, to beg of you, as an act 
of justice to your faithful friends, to withhold any expression of 
approval of the action of this Convention. Your magnanimity 
will be appealed to by those who have stabbed you and outraged 
us, as it was when we were betrayed in 1839 ; but I trust that 
the appeal will meet with a different response. 

In addressing you in this earnest and emphatic manner, I feel 
that I am taking a great, perhaps an unwarrantable liberty, with 
you. I plead, as my apology, my integrity as a Whig and my 
unalterable veneration for yourself. I speak, moreover, the sentiments of your hosts of friends in New York, who only find 
relief from the despondency which weighs them down, in the 
proud reflection that they have battled to the last under your 
glorious and honored name. 



WILLIS HALL TO MR. CLAY. 

New York, June, 1848. 

My dear Mr. Clay, I write to you in the fullness of my 
heart, not to condole with you, for though I feel all the personal 
regard toward you which one man can feel for another, personal 
considerations are absorbed in those of a public nature. 

The Presidency could have added nothing to your fame, and 
would have detracted much from your comfort. 

This Government has had a national existence but little more 
than sixty years, during nearly forty of which it has been guided by your counsels. Glorious period ! You may justly regard 
it with exultation ! During this period you have demonstrated 
the great problem of the feasibility and permanency of popular 
government, and almost every nation in Europe, incited by the 
example, is now convulsed with the effort to imitate it. During 
this period you have impressed upon the country that high and 
honorable spirit in our intercourse with foreign nations, that 
spirit of conciliation and union among the States which have 
preserved us at home and made as respected abroad. 

The uninterrupted and unprecedented prosperity of our national 
career has not been the work of accident. Three times, at least, 
the car of state would have taken the wrong road, if not the 
road to destruction, but foryoiu- guiding hand: once in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1810">1810</a>-12, 
once in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1819">1819</a>-20, once in 1830-31. Will no emergency of the 
kind ever occur again ? When the next storm howls around us, 
this people, guilty and appalled, will shrink back covered with 
fear and dismay at the mischief they have done. You may say 
without arrogance, " Weep not for me, but rather weep for yourselves !" As the scroll of our history unrolls itself, your times 
will stand out in bold and bolder relief until it becomes the 
golden age of some future people, perhaps as unlike the present 
ias the miserable herd that now defile the streets of Rome are 
unlike the associates of the elder Brutus. Convulsions and sterility immediately and abruptly following a tract of rich and elevated fertility, make the period of your counsels a stand mark to 
^11 future time. 

We are on the eve of great events. Slavery will now become 
an immediate and bitter subject of dispute, and will not be relinquished until it is extinguished or the Union dissolved. I feel 
little disposition to commiserate the sufferings of the slave region. They have brought it upon themselves; they have thrust 
slavery upon us in the most offensive way ; the policy of slavery 
governs all their actions ,• their conduct in the Convention will 
not be forgotten ; the means they have taken to render themselves as they fancied more secure on this subject, has precipitated the discussion accompanied with an acrimony which will 
not tend to a friendly adjustment. The Whigs in this quarter 
every where are joining the Barnburners, ready to make the slave 
question the great issue in futiu-e. The next Presidential election (four years hence) will turn upon that point. A Barnburner 
will be elected. 

The Whig party, as such, is dead. The very name will be 
abandoned, should Taylor be elected, for " the Taylor party." 
The last Whig Convention committed the doable crime of suicide and parricide. I loved that party, and whenever and wher<ever I shall hereafter discover any portion of my fellow-citizens 
guided by its principles, I shall attach myself to them ; meantime 
I consider myself absolved from all political connection. 
 

It was resolved to have a ratification meeting here as usual. 
The General Committee met on Monday evening, they were surrounded by more than three thousand people spontaneously collected, and the Committee was compelled to postpone the meeting 
indefinitely, in hopes that General Taylor's letter of acceptance will place himself more distinctly upon Whig ground. 
They will wait in vain. The Taylorites begin to think Taylor's election is not quite as certain as they supposed. 

I hasten to the sole object of this long letter, which is to assure 
you of my undiminished and unalterable regard. Mrs. Hall 
begs me to join her in the expression of these sentiments and 
the respectful assurances of our highest esteem. 



SIR. CLAY TO JAMES HARLAN. 

Ashland, June 22, 1848. 

Mt dear Sir, I wished much to see you, and hope soon to 
meet you. I got your letter from Choles' on your way home, 
and I have received to-day your favor of the 20th with the newspaper you sent me. Judge Robertson has returned, and has given 
me much information ; but there are some points which you can 
best elucidate. 

I shall take no active or partisan part in the canvass, but remain quiet, submitting to what has been done so far as relates to 
myself. I think this is the course prompted by self-respect and 
personal dignity. I shall attend no ratification meetings. How 
can I sanction and approve what the seven delegates from Kentucky did in the Convention, without virtually condemning what 
the five delegates did ? How can I publicly and warmly support a candidate who declared that, in a reversal of conditions, 
he would not have supported, but opposed me ? I am not misled by the humbuggery of the Louisiana delegates. What credentials, what instructions had they ? They showed none, and 
had none. 

In November, if I am spared, I shall, with all the lights then 
before me, go to the polls and vote for that candidate whose election I believe will be least prejudicial to the country. Of course 
I can never vote for Cass. 

It is too soon to form any satisfactory opinion as to the issue 
of the contest. Neither candidate seems to be entirely acceptable to the party which supports him. And I suppose that party 
will probably succeed between whose members there will be 
ultimately the least division and the greatest intermediate reconciliation. 

P. S. The Governor very handsomely tendered me the Executive appointment to the Senate, wMch I this day declined accepting. 


GENERAL SCOTT TO MR. CLAY. 

Elizabethto\\-n, F. J., July 19, 1848. 

My dear Mr. Clay, I have been most unfortunate in respect 
to your very kind note to me of May 30, addressed to this place. 
It followed me to Frederick, Md., then to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, a second 
time to Frederick, thence to Leonardstown (our friend John 
Lee's post-office), and after lying there long after I had left his 
hospitable mansion, it has finally just overtaken me here, via 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 

It is now sixty days since I landed on the Jersey shore, with 
a Mexican disease upon me, and although obliged to travel and 
to engage in the most vexatious and disgusting work, I have not 
had the strength to walk three hundred yards at once in the 
whole time. I am still very feeble, and go to-morrow to the 
sea shore to gain vigor to meet the same court (nearly) in my 
own case, at the beginning of the next month. 

I left Mexico in the comfortable belief that the choice of a 
Whig candidate for the Presidency had been narrowed down to 
would be the nominee. The day after I landed a distinguished 
public man from a wing of the Capitol, a friend of yours, passing 
by got out of the train to see me. I stated my impressions and 
wishes to him., and was astonished to hear him say that your 
friends in Congress, with four exceptions Berrien and Botts, 
but no Kentuckians, were two of them had given you up on 
some calculation of a want of availability ! I promptly said, if 
I could be flattered into the belief that my name on the same 
ticket (below yours) would add the vote of a single State, I 
might be considered as at the service of the party, and authorized him to say so on his return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, notwithstanding 
my reluctance to change my army commission, etc. In a day or 
two I went to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, visited Frederick and returned, but I 
was coniined to a sick bed, and, although I saw many political 
men, I was not in a condition to converse or to exercise the 
slightest influence. I believe the impression was quite general 
that I was not likely to recover. At the end of a week, however, I got back, with difficulty, to Frederick, and there the 
nomination of General Taylor reached me. 

If he shall frankly accept the nomination as a Whig, with a 
pledge to administer the Government on the principles of the 
party, I shall fervently pray for his success. If not, I shall at 
least be indifferent. 


SUSAN ALLIBONE TO MR. CLAY. 

Hamilton, near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, November 6, 1848. 

I denied myself the gratification of giving an immediate reply 
to your kind and most welcome letter, respected sir, because 1 
was aware that the communications of your numerous friends 
present an almost incessant demand upon your attention ; but I 
did not design to be so very considerate as to have allowed more 
than three months to pass away unaccompanied by an assurance 
of my warm affection. 

The debility which often renders me unable to use a mechanical medium for the conveyance of thought, dees not deprive me 
of the consolation of expressing my regard for those I love by 
imploring for them " the blessing of the Lord," which " maketh 
rich and addeth no sorrow with it ;" and for you, dear sir, very 
frequent and earnest prayers have come into my heart. I do 
hope God will grant you a double portion of His spirit. I should 
not feel satisfied if any ordinary measure of contrition, faith, 
love, and holy obedience were yours. We are commanded to 
" covet the best gifts ;" and it is not presumptuous to expect much 
from God, if the merits of our Redeemer be our only plea. Nor 
would I forget to thank Him for the spiritual illumination He 
has granted you, nor for the desire you express to consecrate the 
retirement you are at last permitted to enjoy, to the interests of 
" another and a better world." It is indeed a better world, dear 
Mr. Clay. How delightful will it be to be released forever from 
" every day's support of wrong and outrage, with which earth is 
filled !" What blessedness to worship God without the intrusion 
of one emotion opposed to the holiness of His law, or a single 
wandering thought, and to satisfy the longings of the spirit after 
knowledge, excellence and love, by the eternal contemplation of 
Him who is the concentration of them all. To receive all this 
happiness as the free gift of a Saviour's love, and to attune a 
harp of thanksgiving with heaven-taught melody, ever swelling 
louder and clearer notes of adoration as the past and present become more fully understood, and the future hastens on with 
brightening glory. Oh ! this will be to us a better world. 

It has often occurred to me that while the believer rejoices 
that "to die is gain," he ought also to remember that " to live is 
Christ." I wish to understand the full meaning of this expression. Experience has taught me something of its import, but I 
hope to learn new lessons every day. One of our homilies tells 
us "faith is the hand that puts on Christ," and St. Paul assures 
us " of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God, is made unto us 
wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption." 

How can I, who am so sinful and so suffering, be sufficiently 
thankful that this glorious Redeemer is the portion of my soul ? 
Mine has been a situation of extraordinary necessity, and the 
fullness of Jesus has been its supply. When my earthly friends 
sit down and weep because their unwearied attentions can not 
remove the firm pressure of disease, my Saviour draws me still 
more closely into the sanctuary of His presence, and my wearied 
spirit reposes there in peace. But there is an amputation of the 
heart, caused by the removal of the most cherished objects of 
affection, which requires the still more tender offices of Him who 
" came to give the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of 
praise for the spirit of heaviness ;" and in this sorrow also I 
have been greatly comforted. If I had never known bereavement I could not so fully sympathize with the deep afiiictions to 
which your letter alludes. I am well assured that yoiu- susceptibilities of sufi'ering are unusually acute, and I pray that the con 

solations of the Holy Spirit, and the sanctified uses of adversity 
may be given you in proportionate measure. It may be, also, 
that the dispensations which have caused so painful a void in 
your family circle may be the avenues through which many 
heavenly blessings may be conveyed to its surviving members. 
It may be your delightful privilege to teach them to consecrate 
the energy they have inherited from their earthly parent to the 
glory of their Father in Heaven ; and while I condole with my 
country because she will be deprived of your official services at 
a time when they seem so greatly needed, I do indeed most 
heartily congratulate your children and grandchildren that they 
are permitted to surround you in the evening of your days. 

Permit me to say that I do not think you suit the times, dear 
sir. Expediency has become the watchword of our nation, and 
your political vestments have never assumed a chameleon hue, 
nor has the cloak of concealment been wrapped around them. 
Oh ! that we had many Daniel's to confess that " we, and our 
father's have sinned and done wickedly," and to implore that 
national judgments may be averted. 

The beautiful petition of the Lord's Prayer, " Thy kingdom 
come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven," is most 
appropriate at this time of danger, and how effectually will its 
fulfillment hush into silence the stormy elements around us ! Is 
it not an unspeakable privilege to be the subject of a kingdom 
which can not be moved ? 

I am truly gratified to learn that the health of your little 
granddaughter has so greatly improved, for I feel a deep interest 
in all to whom you are allied. I shall not soon forget the terms 
of affection with which you made me acquainted with the character of Mrs. Clay, to whom you will please present my respectful regards. 

I think I will be so selfish as to tell you how delighted I 
should be to receive another letter from Ashland. 

My sister, Mrs. Alii bone, is my copyist to-day, as I am still unable to attempt a greater effort than the pencilship of a letter. 
From her, with my brother, and other sisters, you will accept 
a message of warm affection, accompanied with my earnest 
prayers that you may ever be enabled to appropriate the assurance. " The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the 
everlasting arms." Believe me, my beloved Mr. Clay, most sij> 
cerely and respectfully yours. 


GENERAL TAYLOR TO MR. CLAY. 

Baton Rouge, La., November lY, 1848. 

My DEAR Sir, On my return here a day or two since, after a 
short absence, I found your highly esteemed letter of the 23d 
ultimo, for which accept my most cordial thanks. The one referred to, written by you in May last, reached me by due course 
of mail, and I owe you an apology for not replying to it, which 
I deferred doing from day to day, under the expectation that 
certain events would occur which I wished to refer to in my 
reply, but which were so long in taking place as to induce me 
to give up doing so altogether. Said letter was entirely satisfactory, as regarded the matter alluded to (and to put an end to 
the misrepresentations growing out of the same, going the 
rounds through various newspapers, I at once caused a short 
article to that effect to be published in " The Picayune" of New 
Orleans, which may have met your eye), and relieved me from 
great anxiety, as I believed the course then pursuing by certain 
individuals touching our correspondence, was calculated, if not 
intended, to bring about a state of distrust, if not unkind feelings, between you and myself, as well as some of our friends ; 
which, had they succeeded in doing, would, so far as I am concerned, been a source of much pain and mortification to me. 

There certainly could be no objection or impropriety in your 
peraiitting your friends to read any of the letters I wrote you, 
who ought not to have made any use of them, for any purpose, 
without your authority, as there was an implied confidence at 
least, which ought not to have been violated. It is true, I allowed a few and very confidential friends to read yours to me, 
nor am I aware that any use was made of them, directly or indirectly, for any purpose whatever ; nor was any copy taken of 
any one of them, and furnished to a member of Congress, or 
any one else, although I have no doubt you have been informed 
I had done so. 

I trust I have many devoted personal friends, who, from various causes, were opposed to my reaching the office in question, 
and took every honorable and proper means in their power, and 
no other, to prevent my success, and I certainly would never 
think of censuring them, much less to permit it on my part to 
interrupt our friendly relations, because they have done what 
they thought right in opposing my election to an office which 
they thought another was better qualified to fill. 

I beg leave to return you many thanks for your kind invitation to visit Ashland, should I go to Kentucky before you leave 
for the South ; which it would have afforded me much pleasure 
to have done, and passed a few days under your hospitable roof ; 
but I must forego this pleasure, as it will be out of my power to 
leave Louisiana or Mississippi for several months, at any rate 
during the present year ; but should you carry out your intentions of visiting the South, as contemplated, and should pass the 
month of January in New Orleans, I will try and take you by 
the hand at that time, or during the same month. 

Wishing you many years of health, happiness, and prosperity, 
I remain, etc. 



J. T. HART TO MR. CLAY. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, December 4, 1848. 

Dear Sir, I hope you will accept this head I send you, 
which I have finished entirely with my own hands ; and also 
another, which I will finish in a day or two, as a small token of 
the gratitude and obligation I feel toward yourself and family, 
who have extended to me so much kindness. 

I will call out to see you this evening or to-morrow. With 
my earnest wishes for your recovery, I am, etc. 


D. KEYES AND OTHERS TO MR. CLAY. 

Clinton, Mich., March 8, 1850. 

Dear Sir, We are humble individuals firmly attached to the 
Democratic faith and the Democratic party, consequently can 
not indorse many things in your political creed. 

But, sir, with us the preservation and harmony of our beloved 
Union are far above all party considerations, and we rejoice at 
your present position in the United States Senate, feeling that 
yom' eminent abilities and patriotic devotion to the Union are 
not only the property of Kentucky, but of the whole Union. 

Please accept our heartfelt thanks for your conciliatory resolutions, and for the masterly manner in which you have supported 
and maintained them. 


FATHER MATTHEW TO MR. CLAY. 

Cork, December 29, 1851. 
My dearest Sir, From the south of that green island which 
you have often, in your own eloquent and all but inspired language, made the subject of your warmest eulogy, the most 
grateful of your admirers presumes to intrude on your well-filled 
time, by presenting to you his heartfelt wishes, at the commencement of the New Year, humbly praying that the Great Bestower 
of every good may bless you with length of days, to promote 
the prosperity of that great country whose pride and glory you 
are, filling both it and Europe with your well-merited fame. 
Blessed be the remainder of your brilliant and useful life, and 
may the prospect of future glory gild it with felicity. Uniting 
your most respected lady in my humble prayer and sincere 
wishes, and the other amiable and beloved members of your 
dear family, to whom I had the honor of an introduction, with 
enduring remembrance of your exceeding kindness in the day 
of my distress, I have the honor to be, most respected sir, etc. 



THEODORE FRELINGHUTSEN TO MR. CLAY. 

New Betjnswick, January 19, 1852. 

My DEAR Sir, I have heard with great interest and anxiety 
of your continued feeble health, and that it had rather been more 
feeble since your decided testimony in behalf of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>'s 
foreign policy. I was rejoiced to hear your words of soberness 
and truth on the exciting question of Hungarian politics; and I 
trust that a divine blessing will follow your counsels. 

In this time of impaired health, and sometimes trying despondency that ensues, it must be refreshing to look away to Him 
who is a helper near in trouble, and able and willing to sustain 
and comfort you. This blessed Gospel, that reveals the riches 
of God's grace in Jesus Christ, is a wonderful remedy : so suited 
to our condition and character, and so full of inexpressible consolation to us, as sinners needing mercy. His blood cleansing 
US from the guilt of sin, His Spirit purifying our hearts, and restoring us to God's image and favor. May you, ray dear friend, 
largely partake of its comforts, and leaning all your hopes on the 
Almighty Saviour's arm, hold on your way, for life and for death, 
for time and eternity, in His name and strength. 



WILLIAM m'lAIN TO MR. CLAY, 

Colonization Rooms, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> Crrr, February 9, 1852. 

Dear Sir, At the recent annual meeting of the American 
Colonization Society, the following resolution was unanimously 
adopted : 

Resolved, That we deeply sympathize with our venerable 
President, the Hon. Henry Clay, in his present protracted illness, 
by which we are deprived of his presence and able counsels at 
this annual meeting of our Society, to which he has, from its 
foundation, devoted himself with signal ability and unwavering 
fidelity ; and that we hold him in affectionate and gratefid remembrance for the distinguished services he has rendered in the 
prosecution of the great scheme of African colonization. 

I take great pleasure, my dear sir, in furnishing you with the 
foregoing resolution. 

Hoping that you may be restored to health, and that this 
Society may continue to have the honor of your name and influence as its President, I remain, etc. 


SIR WILLIAM CLAY TO MR. CLAY. 

No. 1*7 Hertford St., Mayfair, May 8, 1852. 

My dear Sir, So many years have elapsed since the only 
intercourse I ever had the pleasure of holding with you by letters and amity ceased that I can hardly flatter myself you yet 
recollect its occurrence. I could not, however, let my son proceed to the United States without giving him at least the chance 
of becoming personally known to one who has so nobly illustrated the name he himself bears. 

This letter, therefore, will be presented to you by my eldest 
son, William Dickinson Clay, who, with his friend Mr. Morris 
— a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford is about to make the tour 
of the United States. 

I know not whether you and I shall ever meet. I have the 
ardent wish to visit America, but whether my public duties may 
permit of my gratifying that wish, while I have health and 
strength to enjoy the journey, is more than doubtful. 

Should that not occur, but should it so happen that either you 
or any one in whom you take an interest visits England, you 
will not, I hope, forget that you will afford me pleasure by showing that you perfectly rely on the friendly feeling with which I 
am, my dear sir, yours with great respect and regard. 



[Thomas H. Clay, Mi. Clay's second son, having been summoned to the bedside of his father, arrived in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> early 
in May. It will have been seen by the correspondence, that 
Mr. Clay had, till this time, refused his consent for any member 
of the family to come on. From the time of Mr. Thomas H. 
Clay's arrival till the death of his father, he wrote to some 
member of the family, at home, every day. It is thought sufficient to present extracts from this diary, at intervals of about 
five days, which will be found in the following extracts :j 
 



<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> City, May 13, 1852, 
My father passed the last night comfortable without much 
coughing. The only thing the doctors can do, is to alleviate 
as much as they can the pain arising from his cough and his excessive debility. 



Mat 18, 1852. 
My father has passed the last twenty-four hours much more 
comfortably than he had been for a week before. He has slept 
well and should he acquire strength with it, in spite of the predictions of the medical men, I shall begin to hope. It is the cough 
and that alone that has prostrated him ; once relieved from that, 
I know not what we may not hope for. There is yet more 
vitality in him, than the reports in the newspapers would lead 
one to infer. I will keep you all correctly informed. Believe 
nothing that you see or hear, except it comes from me. 



Mat 20, 1852. 

My father coughed but little last night, yesterday he was a 
good deal harassed. Could it be possible to remove his cough, 
he would get well beyond a doubt. He is very feeble, but 
is not so much reduced in flesh as I had supposed before I came 
on here. It is the cough as he himself has always said, that is 
killing him. His lungs are not at all affected. 

He insists on my writing to some of the family, either at 
Mansfield or Ashland, every day. I have but little to communicate in addition to informing you how he passes the days and 
nights. 



Mat 26, 1852. 
My father passed a tolerable night ; you must be aware that 
any improvement in his condition must be gradual, as the prostration he labors under came on in the same way. I have been 
nowhere, and made as few acquaintances as I could ; I am confined all day to his rooms, and last night was up until twelve 
o'clock, as James appeared anxious to go out. I am doing every 
thing that I can to render his situation as comfortable as possiible, allowing myself but little time even for a walk. 



June 1, 1852. 

My father listens attentively to the perusal of every letter 
from home. 

He passed last night in more comfort than he did the night 
before. He had some appetite for his dinner yesterday. 



One o'clock at night, June 4, 1852. 
I wrote you this morning that my father had a bad night, 
and that he was then trying to get some rest ; since I have been 
here, when he has passed a bad night, he was usually able to 
make up for the want of rest, during the following day. But 
such has not been the case to-day. He has coughed a great 
deal, and has had but little intermission from it. He took his 
opiate about two hours ago, and I hope that he will be enabled 
to get some sleep and rest in the next twenty-four hours. I 
shall keep my letter open to let you know how he is until tomorrow evening. He has suffered a good deal since this time 
last night. 



June 7, 1852. 

My father was yesterday much depressed. He had held a 
long conversation with Mr. Crittenden and requested me to treat 
him kindly. Besides a cold sweat after dinner, all these things 
were sufficient to make him feel low spirited. He told me that 
he thought there would soon be a termination to it. The doctor 
thought on his afternoon visit that he was no worse than usual. 
God alone knows. 



Junk 9, 1852. 

My father has become feeble within a few days, and 1 do not 
think it possible for him to hold out long. 
 

June 16, 1852. 

My father is to-day decidedly worse than he has been since 
my arrival. I wrote to Mr. Theobald this morning that there 
was but little or no change in his condition ; since then,' I am 
satisfied he is worse. He has had a copious perspiration, which 
has greatly weakened him. The attending physician. Dr. Hall, 
rubbed him all over the person with brandy and alum. He told 
me this morning that he did not think he should last more than 
ten days. 

I have been constant in my attendance on him. I think I 
can see a marked change in his countenance. 



June 20, 1852. 

My father did not pass a good night, nor has he slept much 
this morning. A friend yesterday afternoon brought him three 
woodcocks ; he ate a little of one of them this morning. He 
never now gets out of bed. He is moved occasionally from one 
bed to the other, for the purpose of ventilating and making up. 
He was too feeble this morning to carry a glass of water to his 
lips. The weather has been very hot during the week, the 
mercury rising at one time to 93°. 



June 25, 1852. 

I now look for a termination in my father's case before many 
hours. I do not feel in any mood to write to any one but you, 
my wife. Judge Underwood coincides with me in opinion that 
he will not last many hours. The next you receive from me 
will probably be a telegraphic dispatch, directed to Mr. Harrison. 



June 29, 1852. 

I had never before imagined that any one could live in the 
extreme state of debility under which my father is now suffering. 
The act of taking even a single swallow of water is painful to 
him, on account of his great feebleness. He has eaten nothing of 

any consequence (only a few mouthfnls of soup) for five or six 
days. I can not believe he can' possibly survive through the 
week. 



<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, June 29, 1852, 

The followmg message was received at this office to-day, 
dated <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, 29th, 1852, twelve o'clock; 

J. O. Harrison 

My father is no more. He has passed without pain 
into eternity. 

Thos. H. Clay.
