My DEAR Sir, I received to-day your favor under date the 
4th, with its inclosures, as I did your former letters, including 
General M'Clure's letter. I thank you for them. I have directed 
twenty copies of the circular prepared by the Kentucky Committee of Correspondence (which I have not seen), to be forwarded to you for distribution. Copies have also been ordered 
to most of our friends in  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> and New York. Although 
I have not perused it, I presume, from the pen from which it 
issues, that it is well composed. An address from the same 
quarter has been written to Virginia, intended for that region, 
but so guarded as to do mischief nowhere, if it be published, 
which is to be anticipated. These papers will, I think, contribute to arouse and animate my friends. The remark which you 
make is but too true, that there has not been sufficient united exertion among them. Every thing is yet going well in the West. 
It is amazing to see the mistakes or misstatements made about it 
at the East. For example : Stratten was said to be elected in 
Missouri, and was claimed by the " Franklin Gazette" for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>. No, says the " National Journal," although he is 
elected, we know he is for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. Now, it turns out that 
Scott is elected, and that Stratten declared himself for me.
