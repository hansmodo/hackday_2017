 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, August 24,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, Yours of the 15th instant, addressed to me at the Olympian Springs, did not reach me until a few days ago at  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, or 
it should have been earlier answered. 
</p><p>
I recollect, during the session of the Assembly of  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1803">1803</a>, having 
had one or more conversations with you relative to the amendment of the Federal Constitution, providing for a deb;^,'Tntion of 
the President and Vice-President in the votes to be given for 
those officers. But I regret that my memory does not enable me 
to detail the particulars of those conversations. I remember, 
however, that you expressed doubts as to the propriety of the 
proposed amendment, urged some arguments to prove that the 
existing provision was best, and suggested your fears that a 
change would produce mischievous consequences. Whether 
your opinion was matured or not I can not say, but I do not 
think you expressed one decisively. If the name of General 
Pinckney was mentioned, and how or by whom it was introduced, at the times of the conversations, or at any of them, it 
has escaped my memory. I have heard you speak of that gentleman, I think, more than once, in terms of high respect, and 
it may have been when the topic of conversation was the amendment ; but I do not believe that you drew any parallel between 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> and him, or contended that he was equally well 
qualified to fill the presidential chair. 
</p><p>
When I saw the handbill to which you allude, I was surprised 
at some of the sentiments there ascribed to you ; and am inclined 
to think had they been avowed in my presence and hearing, that 
they would have made an impression which would be still fresh.
