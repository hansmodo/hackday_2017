<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=adb" rel="colleague met friend">Dr. Beatty</a>, This day was fixed by resolution of the two 
Houses of Congress for its adjournment, but that resolution has 
been rescinded, and the session protracted one week longer. On 
the great subject of our foreign affairs, I believe we shall adjourn 
without adopting any efficient measure. A bill to augment the 
duties fifty per cent, has passed the House of Representatives, 
but I fear, like Macon's bill, it will not be concurred in by the 
Senate. One of its valuable effects, if it passes, will be the encouragement of our manufactures. As the increase is not" contemplated, however, to be permanent, I should prefer a smaller 
augmentation, and that it should be durable.

Two committees of the House of Representatives are engaged in investigating Wilkinson's conduct (who has at length arrived), 
one into the Spanish conspiracy, and the other into the causes 
of the mortality of the army last summer. On this latter subject 
it is expected a report will be made this session ; upon the other 
a report will hardly be made before the next. 
Howard is appointed Governor of Louisiana.
