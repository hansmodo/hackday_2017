My dear Sir, I duly received your favor of the 16th and 
19th ult., with the  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> address. I also received one or 
two preceding letters from you, which I have not before acknowledged the receipt of.
Mr. Holley, just returned from an Eastern trip, saw <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> 
about a fortnight ago, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericktown" rel="city">Fredericktown</a>, on his return from the 
Springs. He says that his gait, articulation, and general appearance indicated most clearly the paralysis under which he has 
labored, and that he appeared to be much more infirm than Mr. 
Jefferson at the age of eighty-two, whom he also saw. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind admonition about the uncertainty 
as to the pending election, and the utility of repressing a too 
great anxiety. I hope you will not, as you seem to anticipate, 
have any occasion for philosophical exertion on account of your 
own election.
</p><p>
I have some thought of passing through Virginia, and visiting 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="">Mr. Madison</a>, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jab" rel="colleague met">Governor Barbour</a>.
