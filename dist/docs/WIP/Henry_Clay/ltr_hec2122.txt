Dear Sir, I received your favor of the 9th. You mention 
that you have thought of becoming a candidate for the Senate, 
and, justly viewing me as one of your friends, you have asked 
my opinion. 
</p><p>
In the first place, I beg leave to state that I have always felt 
a most lively and sincere interest in your welfare, and that it 
would give me, personally, much satisfaction to see you in the 
situation suggested. With respect to your prospect of success I 
am not a very good judge, having been so much of late years 
out of the State, and therefore knowing but little of the weight 
and standing of different individuals. I hinted at the subject to 
Barry, who seemed to think that, living in one extreme of the 
State, however much esteemed there, you were probably hardly 
well enough known at the other to comment with any certainty upon 
your success. I did not mention it to Breckenridge, because I 
am quite sure that he proposes to himself the career of politics, 
and I have heard, though not from him, nor from any one that 
as far as I know, was authorized by him, that he is looking himself to the situation. I should think the event would greatly depend upon the persons who might happen to be your competitors. 
Should Colonel Johnson offer, (he has been talked of, with what 
authority from himself I know not,>) or perhaps Breckenridge, 
you would probably fail. 
</p><p>
I will now give you, in the frankness which is due from the friendship I feel for you, my opinion. I do not think yon ought 
to accept the situation, if you had a moral certainty of getting it. 
Although comfortable in your pecuniary condition, you are not 
rich, and you have a growing family. Instead of making additions to your fortune, you would most probably make annual subtractions from it, during your service. For if your pay should 
cover your expenses, while absent from your family, affairs would 
go on less profitably at home than they do now. Such, at least, 
is my experience ; and such I believe to be in the nature of 
things. Congress, too, has greater attractions at a distance than 
near. After the novelty wears off (which it commonly does in 
the course of two or three months), the interest which was at 
first felt is diminished, if not extinguished, with most of those, 
at least, who are not perfectly at their ease in their circumstances, 
or who are not in pursuit of place, and are willing to venture 
every thing on getting it, or, lastly, those few individuals whose 
great attainments give them a high degree of prominence in the 
body and in the nation. 
</p><p>
With respect to yourself (I write, you see, with the frankness 
and freedom which you have invited,) your talents are of the 
most respectable kind ; but they are better adapted to the career 
which you have been wisely pursuing than to that of politics. 
While you would never fail to speak sensibly, your elocution 
would not perhaps procure for you that high degree of eminence 
which I am sure you would be ambitious of reaching. Besides, 
you have great reason to expect promotion in the judiciary of 
either the State or the United States, when vacancies shall occur. 
While judicial appointment might also be acquired in the situation to which we refer, it is perhaps not so direct a road to it as 
by a faithful and enlightened discharge of the duties of your 
present office. There is, moreover, always some risk (and it is 
greater as we are more advanced in hfe) in quitting an occupation 
with which one is familiar, and entering upon another with which 
he is less conversant. The intimate alliance between law and 
politics, and the habit which is so common in our country of 
participating in the consideration of its political affairs, diminishes 
but does not entirely remove this objection. 
</p><p>
I have given you my candid sentiments. Yom- own better 
judgment will, at last, guide you, as it ought ; and that you may 
be successful and prosperous, however you may decide, is my 
sincere wish. 
</p><p>
