My dear Sir, I duly received your favor of the 16th inst. 
I did not become acquainted with Colonel Gooch while he was 
here. An incident that occurred may serve to explain the charge 
to which you refer. It is the duty of the Speaker to admit 
stenographers. Mr. Stevenson said to me, " Colonel Gooch is 
here, and probably would like to take down the debates, etc., 
for the '' Enquirer" during his stay, but I am not authorized to 
apply for his admission." I replied, if Colonel Gooch wants a 
seat within the hall, bond fide for that purpose, he shall be admitted ; but that I could not consent to his admission merely 
to give him a comfortable place, without reference to the duties 
of a stenographer. Mr. Stevenson said he should advise him 
not to apply, etc. He did not make an application. I afterward understood that he complained ; but I was also told that, 
after an explanation with Mr. Stevenson, he left here entirely 
satisfied with my conduct.

I inclose you the extract of a letter which has been sent me 
from New York, respecting a contemplated call of the Legislature. I have very little doubt that such a measure has been 
determined on, and will take place, unless the Governor changes 
his intention. If my efforts on the tariff have injured me in 
Virginia, they have benefited me in other quarters.
