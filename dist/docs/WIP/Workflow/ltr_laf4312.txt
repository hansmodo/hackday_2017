My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
I am fortunate in this opportunity to wish you a happy new j^ear, and to devote the first moments of 
this day to the heartfelt pleasure to remind you, my beloved General, of your adoptive son and most affectionate, devoted friend. I beg you will present my 
best respects to ]\Irs. Washington. Madame de Lafayette joins in the most tender compliments to you 
and to her ; and I hope, my dear General, that you will be so kind as to mention me very affectionately to all the family and friends.

It is needless for me to tell you, that I read the 
new proposed Constitution with an unspeakable eagerness and attention. I have admired it, and find in 
it a bold, large, and solid frame for the Confederation. 
The election principles, with respect to the two Houses 
of Congress, are most happily calculated. I am only 
afraid of two things; â€” first, the want of a declaration 
of rights ; secondly, the great powers and possible continuance of the President, who may one day or other 
become a Stadtholder. Should my observations be 
well founded, I still am easy on two accounts. The 
first, that a bill of rights may be made, if wished by 
the people, before they accept the Constitution. My 
other comfort is, that you cannot refuse being elected 
President ; and that, if you think the public vessel 
can stir without those powers, you will be able to 
lessen them, or propose measures respecting their permanence, which cannot fail to insure a greater perfection to the Constitution, and a new crop of glory 
to yourself But^ in the name of America, of mankind at large, and your own fame, I "beseech you, 
my dear General, not to deny your acceptance of 
the office of President for the first years. You only 
can settle that political machine ; and I foresee it will furnish an admirable chapter to your history.

I am returned from the Provincial Assembly of 
Auvergne, wherein I had the happiness to please the 
people, and the misfortune to displease the Government 
to a very high degree. The Ministry asked for an 
increase of revenue. Our Province w^as among the 
few who gave nothing, and she expressed herself in 
a manner which has been taken very much amiss. 
The internal situation of France is very extraordinary. The dispositions of the people, of which I gave 
you a picture^ are working themselves into a great 
degree of fermentation, but not without a mixture of 
levity and love of ease. The Parliaments are every 
day passing the boundaries of their Constitution, but 
are sure to be approved by the nation, when, among 
many irrational things, they have the good policy to 
call for a General Assembly. Government see that 
the power of the Crown is declining, and now want 
to retrieve it by an ill-timed and dangerous severity. 
For my part, I am heartily wishing for a Constitution 
and bill of rights, and wish it may be effected with 
as much tranquillity and mutual satisfaction as it is 
possible.

The Emperor has made a foolish attempt on Belgrade, but cannot fail to take it another time, and at 
the entrance of the spring the two Imperial Courts 
will open a vigorous and no doubt successful campaign against the Turks. They have been led into 
a war by Great Britain; and should France take a 
decisive part, it is more probable she will side with 
Russia. But this Government will avoid to be committed in the affair, and perhaps will not be the better for it. The King of Prussia is now courting 
France, and proposes, I think, to withdraw his regiments from Holland ; but this is a very insufficient, 
and probably a very useless reparation.

Inclosed, my dear General, are an arret of the 
Council, and a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, both of which, 
after long negotiations, we have had the satisfaction 
to obtain. I expected it might be finished before 
my journey to Auvergne ; but new difficulties have 
arisen, and <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and myself have but lately 
ended the business. I am more and more pleased 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>. His abilities, his virtues, his temper, every thing of him commands respect and attracts 
affection. He enjoys universal regard, and does the 
affairs of America to perfection. It is the happiest 
choice that could be made. Adieu, my dear General. 
With filial love and respect, I have the honor to be, 
Your devoted and affectionate friend,
