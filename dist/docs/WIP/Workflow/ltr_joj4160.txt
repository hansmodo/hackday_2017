My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The friendship and attachment which I have so long and so uniformly experienced from you, will not permit me to delay expressing how deeply and sincerely I participate 
with you in the afflicting event* which the public are now lamenting, and which you have so many domestic and particular reasons to bewail. 
</p><p>
The philosophic topics of consolation are familiar to you, and we all know from experience how little relief is to be derived from them. May the Author and only Giver of 
consolation be and remain with you. 
</p><p>
With great esteem and affectionate regard, 
</p><p>
I am, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
