Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I fully intended, for several weeks past, to pay my respects in person to your Excellency, but am 
obliged to deny myself that pleasure, having been detained here much longer than I expected, and been anxious to return to Carolina. 
</p><p>
Though I have no doubt that the matter committed 
to your Excellency, by a resolve of Congress of the 
5th instant, has already engaged your attention, and 
that you will order the most proper plan for effecting so desirable a measure to be carried into execution, as soon as the more immediate object of the 
present campaign will admit, yet I cannot forbear representing, that the state of South Carolina and 
Georgia is such as demonstrates the absolute necessity of expelling the enemy from those countries, as 
speedily as possible ; and that this cannot be done 
without a considerable naval force, and a large number of regular troops. I therefore flatter myself that, 
as soon as the intended operations against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
shall be terminated, either successfully (as I hope 
they will be) or by the season's not admitting a continuance of them, or if an attack on that city should 
not be deemed expedient, your Excellency will send 
such a force to the southward. 
</p><p>
Congress have requested the Minister of France to 
use his influence to cause the plan of operations which you may form, or the measures which you may 
recommend to be undertaken by the forces of their 
most Christian and Catholic Majesties, in consequence 
of the resolve above mentioned, to be carried into 
effect. He is heartily disposed and has promised to 
do so. Should your Excellency require aid from the 
French forces in the West Indies, I have good reasons to believe it will be afforded, unless the Commanders there are expressly limited to acting in the 
islands, which I cannot conceive they are. In that 
case, I am persuaded that your application to the 
Court of France would obtain a revocation of such 
orders, and that his most Christian Majesty would 
grant any lesser forces which you may require, either 
from his kingdom or his islands. 
</p><p>
Thinking that it is thus in your power, and convinced that it is your earnest wish, to restore peace 
and safety to the two southernmost States, I hope 
those blessings will be speedily obtained. A consideration of the difficulty and delay attending the 
collecting any considerable quantity of provisions, will, 
I am sure, induce your Excellency to give timely 
notice of what measures you wish to have established 
in the Carolinas. I shall take the liberty of transmitting to your Excellency, from time to time, any 
intelligence which may appear material, and shall be 
happy to hear from you, that the prospect of complete relief to my distressed country is not far distant. I have the honor to be. 
</p><p>
With the greatest respect, &c., 
</p><p>
