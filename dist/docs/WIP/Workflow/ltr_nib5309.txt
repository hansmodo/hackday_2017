Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... In regard to the offer from the State Bank of the 
Presidency of the Branch at <a href='/results.php?city=fayetteville' rel='city'>Fayetteville</a>, I think you should 
not hesitate to accept it. My great anxiety now is, that the !3fficers of the Bank should be able to separate from it with 
;he least possible inconvenience to themselves and I am anxious particularly that they should lose no opportunity 
&gt;f obtaining proper employment elsewhere. If therefore the 
situation offered be in other respects satisfactory, there is 
nothing in your relations with the Bank that should induce 
you to decline it. 
</p><p>
This brings me to another matter connected with it on 
which I proposed to write to you. We are now making 
arrangements with several of the new Banks to purchase 
the whole establishment of the Office near them banking 
house, debts &amp; all. This plan is very advantageous to the 
new Bank which thus succeeds to the standing, capital, de 
posits &amp; custom of the Office, &amp; to the Bank of the U.S. it 
possesses the attraction of enabling them to close the Office 
at once. As an example of such a settlement, I will mention 
what has just taken place at <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, Kentucky. The President &amp; Cashier of the Office have been appointed President 
&amp; Cashier of the Northern Bank of Kentucky and that 
Institution has agreed to take the Banking House at the valuation hitherto put up upon it in our schedules &amp; also to 
take the whole of the current debt not including of course 
the domestic bills at its nominal amount, giving the notes 
of the Bank of Kentucky payable in I, 2, 3, &amp; 4 years with 
interest at five per cent. The suspended debt the Bank of 
Kentucky agrees to manage and collect without charge. 
</p><p>
Now, if you could make a similar arrangement with the 
Bank of the State or any other institution, it would be satis 
factory to us. 
</p><p>
Let me hear from you soon on this subject &amp; believe me 
meanwhile 
</p><p>
