My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I had this morning the pleasure of receiving your favor 
of yesterday during the session of the Board from which I 
was not released in time to answer it by the return of the mail 
I need not say that it will afford me great satisfaction to assist 
in refuting the injurious representations of your affairs, 
which I remember to have seen without reading, as I should 
have read without believing them. I began by ascertaining 
from the records of the Bank the accuracy of your statement 
but as the returns from the offices represent only the debts 
of the parties, and not the paper which they deposit for collection, I cannot speak on that subject with as much distinctness as I am able to do in regard to the reduction of your debt 
and your fidelity in complying with your engagements to the 
Bank. On reflection I think it better not to publish a formal 
certificate, but to introduce the testimony of the Bank in a 
manner less direct tho equally authoritative. With the reason 
of this, I need not trouble you tho I do not doubt that you would concur with me. You will also I hope agree in the 
opinion that the fittest channel now for such a communication is Mr Walsh. The relation in which he stands to the present contest will under his agency [be] more independent, and 
he will give a pungency &amp; force to the contradiction which will 
probably secure to it a wider circulation than it could obtain 
through any other of our papers. I have accordingly given 
to him a statement which he will embody in a paragraph for 
tomorrow's gazette. You and he I believe do not always 
agree in the upper regions of politics but I regret to see 
estrangements among those whom I esteem &amp; on this occasion he will do you justice frankly &amp; cordially. I trust you 
will be satisfied with the manner in which the subject will be 
presented &amp; believe me very truly 
</p>
