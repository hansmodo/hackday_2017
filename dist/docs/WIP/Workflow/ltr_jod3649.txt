MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received yours of the 18th, and none later. 
Your company here is much desired by every body, 
but by none so much as me. My occupation in business is so incessant that I could have little time to 
pass with you, but that little every day would be precious and invaluable. You express a willingness to 
come on ; but the thought of attempting it without 
consulting your friends and physicians distresses and 
terrifies me lest it should prove fatal to a life that is 
dear to me beyond all expression. If, however, your 
physicians are of opinion that you can come on by 
easy journeys, in any way you can think of, your arrival here will be an inexpressible satisfaction to me. 
But if you attempt to come without a fixed resolution to take care of your health and renounce those 
fatigues of public places, drawing rooms, great dinners, &c., I am very apprehensive that this winter 
will be your last. A constitution so wrecked and 
exhausted as yours has been by a three months confinement, may be easily overset 
</p><p>
We are all well and every thing goes on very well. 
We had the ministry and general officers to dine on 
Monday, and all agreeable. 
</p><p>
I am, with tenderness inexpressible, ever yours, 
</p><p>
