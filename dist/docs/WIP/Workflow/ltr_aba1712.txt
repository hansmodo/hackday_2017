I RECEIVED by the Deacon two letters from you, this 
day, from Hartford. I feel a recruit of spirits upon 
the reception of them, and the comfortable news 
which they contain. We had not heard any thing 
from North Carolina before, and could not help feel 
ing anxious, lest we should find a defection there, 
arising more from their ancient feuds and animosities, than from any settled ill-will in the present con 
test ; but the confirmation of the choice of their delegates by their Assembly, leaves not a doubt of their 
firmness ; nor doth the eye say unto the hand, " I 
have no need of thee." The Lord will not cast off 
his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. 
Great events are most certainly in the womb of futurity ; and, if the present chastisements which we 
experience have a proper influence upon our conduct, 
the event will certainly be in our favor. The distresses 
of the inhabitants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> are beyond the power of 
language to describe ; there are but very few who are 
permitted to come out in a day ; they delay giving 
passes, make them wait from hour to hour, and their 
counsels are not two hours together alike. One day, 
they shall come out with their effects ; the next day, 
merchandise is not effects. One day, their house 
hold furniture is to come out ; the next, only wearing apparel ; the next, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, 
and he refuseth to hearken to them, and will not let 
the people go. May their deliverance be wrought 
out for them, as it was for the children of Israel. I 
do not mean by miracles, but by the interposition of 
Heaven in their favor. They have taken a list of 
all those who they suppose were concerned in watch 
ing the tea, and every other person whom they call 
obnoxious, and they and their effects are to suffer 
destruction. Yours,
