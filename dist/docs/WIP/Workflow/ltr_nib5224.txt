My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I thank you for your favor of the 9 th inst. in regard to 
the <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> office which we have this day arranged aggreeably to your recommendation. The only departure from it 
is that we have fixed the salary at $800 &amp; the professional 
compensation at $1,200 instead of making each $1,000. 
This was done so as to preserve the symmetry of our system 
of compensation to the Presidents of Offices of similar Capital to that of <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and not to make any invidious distinctions between them. To Mr Mason the form is I presume indifferent. 
</p><p>
It remains now to secure his election. 
</p><p>
You know that the Parent Board indicated their preference of a President by placing him at the head of the list 
and this is usually decisive but the election is actually with the Board of the Office, and altho I have no reason to sup 
pose that there will be any difficulty, yet [it] is always so much 
easier, if possible, to prevent them to overcome obstacles, that 
I wish you would take upon yourself to promote his election by any communication which you may deem judicious 
with the Board of the Office, whose names are subjoined. I 
enclose Mr Mason's letter to you.
</p>
