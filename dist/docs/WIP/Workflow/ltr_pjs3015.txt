DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The letter, which I had the honor to write you 
yesterday, I delivered to <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a>, who sailed 
this day. 
</p><p>
I have, within this half hour, received a letter from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a>, of which the inclosed is a copy. I 
fear the next will announce the evacuation of Canada by our troops, probably with loss, as I fear that 
not a sufficient attention has been paid to a recommendation of mine, to bring all the bateaux, that 
could possibly be spared from Sorel, to St. John s. I 
shall immediately despatch an express to Fort George 
to send bateaux to St. John's ; but, after all, the 
number will be very small, for want of men to navigate them. I suppose one hundred and twenty, at 
least, are at Lake George. 
</p><p>
I am not under the least apprehension that the 
enemy will be able to cross Lake Champlain, provided that our army is able to retreat into that Lake, 
that ammunition is speedily sent up, and a further 
supply of pork forwarded, without delay, to this 
place. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will perceive that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> 
informs me, that the enemy have the frames, &c., for 
gondolas on board. We should therefore build a 
number of these vessels, with all possible despatch; 
one is now on the stocks, but we want people that 
understand the construction of them. I have some 
time ago begged Congress to send one, express; let 
me entreat that some more capable persons may be 
sent up, and twenty shipwrights with them. 
As I fear the saw-mills will not be able to saw a 
sufficient number of plank, I wish to have a dozen 
of whipsaws and files sent up with all possible despatch. 
</p><p>
I shall order all the bateaux that do not go to 
St. John's out of Lake George, to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, that 
they may be ready, at that place, to be sent to 
Skenesborough, to convey the militia,, should they be 
sent up. I am, with every respectful sentiment, your 
Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
