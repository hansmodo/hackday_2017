Dear General, 
</p><p>
In consequence of intelligence, received yesterday 
morning from the westward, that the fleet of transports, which were lately in the Sound, and supposed 
to be coming this way, had sailed towards <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
General Count de Rochamheau expressed his pleasure 
that the militia, which had arrived and were on their 
march for his support, except those detached for 
three months, should return home, I immediately 
communicated it to them. 
</p><p>
Nothing could have exceeded the spirit which has 
been shown by the militia on this occasion. The hint 
given by the Count, that he had come to their support, but at that moment stood in need of theirs, instantly fired every breast, and old and young, of all 
denominations, were determined to rush into the field 
to his aid. The Count expresses the highest pleasure 
and satisfaction, as do all the officers on this occasion. The Count wishes to detain the three months' 
men a few days, to secure the pass at Howland's 
Ferry. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
