MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY : 
</p><p>
As your Excellency has taken the whole matter of the late agreement 
with the British on yourself, and that by the executive authority, and 
executive, &c., mentioned in the fourth article, your Excellency is to 
be understood. I was in doubt with myself (and took a day or two to 
consider further of it) whether there would be occasion to trouble your 
Excellency with the little mentioned; but, as I still unhappily differ 
from your Excellency in opinion, and am persuaded, if from nothing 
else, from the want of precision, at least, in the expression of that 
article, the State at large will be led to think the Privy Council are 
made a party thereto, and, of course, myself, a member thereof. As I 
dislike the agreement, very cogent reasons oblige me to send your 
Excellency my formal disapprobation thereof, nearly in the words. I 
drew immediately a rough sketch on seeing it, which I then showed to 
those gentlemen of the Council I mentioned to your Excellency, and 
should have sent it to your Excellency had not the Council been summoned so soon. The doctrine broached at the last Council, which I 
never heard or suspected before, that the Privy Council is in no case 
part of the executive, is, in my opinion, very alarming; it tends to 
make them insignificant, and the next step is, when an opportunity 
offers, to expunge that body altogether from the Constitution, and pre 
pare the way to reduce this Government to a kind of Principality. I 
have frequently, in the Assembly, taken notice how great an eye-sore 
the Privy Council seemed to be to some gentlemen amongst us, and 
what indirect strokes were aimed at them. That the Governor is the 
sole ostensible executive of the State, is readily granted; further, that 
in all acts wherein he is not particularly retrained by law, he may be 
said to be absolutely so; but, in such laws wherein it is expressly 
directed that he shall not act but by the advice and consent of the 
Privy Council, there they are certainly part of the executive. For I 
have ever learned, that whatever is essentially necessary to a thing, that 
that thing cannot exist without it, most belong to it and participate of 
its nature so in this last case, .whenever the law requires that when a 
Governor is inclinable to a certain executive act, that executive act 
shall not be done but by the advice and consent of the Privy Council. 
If it be done without such advice and consent, it is illegal; therefore, 
they are certainly a sine qua non to make the Governor act legally in 
such instance, and, consequently, in such cases, are a necessary part of 
the executive, and the individual members thereof may be said to be 
parties thereof. What confusion this can occasion, or how by this 
omission there can be ten Governors in this State instead of one, not 
withstanding what a learned, or any number of learned lawyers what 
ever may say, I cannot conceive. Besides, in case of the death of a 
Governor, during the recess of the Assembly, will not the Lieutenant-Governor immediately succeed, and, in case of his death, too, one of 
Privy Council? Does not this show they belong to the executive? 
</p><p>
Their participation of the executive is but sometimes in particular cases, 
and that only internally or privately (as a Privy Council) without any 
external authority whatever; this belongs solely to the Governor or 
Commander-in-Chief. This, or something like it, I take to be the intention of the words in the eleventh article of the Constitution " in 
manner herein mentioned," placed immediately after to modify and re 
strain the words " that the executive authority be vested in the Governor and Commander-in-Chief;" otherwise, those words must be altogether nugatory, and put for no purpose whatever. I will now beg 
leave to trouble your Excellency with the letter already mentioned. 
" May it please your Excellency I have seen the agreement with the 
British, dated the 10th, and find by its fourth clause that, as a particle 
of the executive, though unconsulted, I seem to be made a party therein 
to promote its acceptance with the public, which occasions my troubling 
your Excellency by letter, as my conscience and duty oblige me to 
declare that I disapproved almost every article. Indeed, I am not able 
to see any pressing occasion we had for any further meeting with the 
enemy s commissioners, after the last, convened at their request, broke 
up, which I was not sorry for, as we have so greatly the advantage of 
them, in point of British property, to lay our hands on when we please. 
This they well knowing, no doubt occasioned so much anxiety on their 
side for a further meeting. The agreement itself appears to me extremely injurious to the public, and fear it will involve us in endless 
ill consequences. With British lawsuits, no doubt, our courts will be 
filled; but these are trifles to what might be mentioned. The exception in the first article is not only, in my humble opinion, imprudent 
and impolitic with regard to ourselves; but, when taken with the 
second, has an unfriendly (if not inimical) aspect towards our sister 
States. Its eighth article is, in the last degree, humiliating. The greatest and tenderest care seem to be taken of the British interest, honor, 
and even delicacy, throughout the agreement, while our rights, and 
what is essential to our honor and interest, are totally omitted, or not 
mentioned with that unequivocal plainness and precision, and that decisive firmness we had room to expect. The whole agreement carries 
such manifest appearance of timid and over-cautious fear of offending 
the British, that instead of hastening, it has a natural tendency, when 
considered with the situation of the State for this last campaign, to 
retard their departure to the last moment they possibly can, in hopes 
that (as only interior disadvantages on their side oblige them to think 
of an evacuation) some external good luck may turn up in the interim, 
to bring about a recall of their orders. The plentiful markets and 
great trade they have already had with our people during the whole 
summer, the prospect of still greater when the crops come in, together 
with no small advantages they may promise to themselves if they can 
but stay, to dabble through their emissaries at our ensuing election, 
must of themselves be strong allurements to a watchful enemy not to 
hurry away until it is absolutely unavoidable; and must not their inducements be still stronger when they consider what is too glaring to 
escape them, the lax situation of our Government for want of courts, 
notwithstanding the parade of an Assembly sitting at Jacksonborough. 
The preference too currently given them, of all kind of necessaries 
for their specie and goods, rather than to our own army, which has 
been more than once in want, even of our common staple, rice, and 
beef, for several days together (and I wish I may not soon experience 
more alarming wants than any they have hitherto felt, if something 
more vigorous than in terrorem threats are not speedily and resolutely 
fallen upon) is no small addition to their other advantages. Above all, 
are not the enemy sure that our army cannot compel them to go away, 
or restrain them from making incursions almost anywhere for many 
miles, but just about the spot they occupy? These must be great incitements for them to stay, if possible. The first article will be of more 
service than ever, as having experienced, they can put a confidence in 
them, and of the most dreadful consequences to us, by having such 
powerful arguments to induce others to join them, and exert themselves 
to the utmost to do us as much mischief as they possibly can, finding 
they will thereby recommend themselves the more to the British, and 
stand the better chance to insure them protection upon a pinch. In 
my humble opinion, better the whole value of these fellows should be 
lost altogether than that the public should countenance so dreadful a 
mischief.

" My duty to the State, and regard to my own reputation, (not desiring to be looked upon as a party to promote what I disapprove of,) has 
extorted this letter from me, which I hope will not give your Excellency any offence, which is far from my intention; for believe me, sir, 
no man more sincerely wishes that your administration, in these very 
difficult times, may prove not only serviceable to the public, but also 
honorable to yourself, and meet with general applause, than I do. I 
had some thoughts of reserving my opinion on this measure in my own 
breast till the Assembly sat ; but, upon further consideration, it appeared uncandid to your Excellency, and looked too much like cunning, which 
I abhor. 
</p><p>
I am, with great respect, your Excellency s &c., &c.,

N. B. The former part of this letter does not enter into the merits, 
whether the Governor had a right to exercise that particular act of 
agreement with the British solely of himself; but only takes up Mr. Rutledge's assertion in the Governor's favor, that the Privy Council 
were a part of the executive in no case whatever.
