Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Fortune seems to smile upon the perseverance of 
Great Britain. Count do Grasse's defeat, mentioned 
in my official letter, appears to be much more important than I expected. Since I wrote, I have seen 
Admiral Rodney's letter. Count de Grasse is a prisoner, and has lost six ships of the line; and I fear 
the rest of the fleet are so shattered as to be incapable of attempting any thing for a long time. This 
misfortune will put it out of the power of our ally 
to cooperate with us in these States or to the northward. I expect the enemy, from finding it impracticable for the French to cooperate with us, and from 
having again the command of the sea, will detach 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to this quarter to prosecute farther 
operations. However, this will depend upon the force 
they have at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. All that "will he necessary 
there, will he a good garrison. They cannot have 
offensive operations in view there. Their force is 
unequal to it; but, by detaching a part to this quarter, they can improve it to advantage, and leave New 
York in perfect security. 
</p><p>
I have always been of opinion that farther attempts would be made for the subjugation of this 
country, should fortune favor them in the West Indies. I can see no other reason for having held 
footing in it so long. Should <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a> be 
ordered to this quarter for offensive operations, I 
hope your Excellency will also come yourself; for it 
will not be for the honor of America that a foreigner 
command an American department. If this cannot 
take place, I could wish the American force could 
act independent of his command, and only act by 
conjunction. I believe my rank will give several 
French officers a right to command me ; but, if the 
honor of the nation was not connected with it, I 
should have no objection. However, I shall be perfectly satisfied with whatever you may think necessary for the good of the service. My desire to be 
useful is so much greater than my wish for command, that there are no conditions to which I will 
not cheerfully submit, that are not personally disgraceful, to promote the interest of this country. 
</p><p>
I fear Virginia will do little, while the French 
army is in that State, either for herself or the Union. 
As far as I can learn, little or nothing has been done 
for seven months past; nor can I learn that any decisive measures are pursuing for the purpose. Whatever may be your Excellency's intentions with regard to the French army, it would not be amiss to 
inform the Governor that they may expect that army to leave them shortly, and that great exertions are 
necessary for their own security. It may serve as a spur, and the genius of America often requires spurring. 
</p><p>
I wish to know your Excellency's intentions in this 
quarter, as early as possible. Many measures will be 
requisite to accommodate matters to your views, if 
you have any thing offensive in view. Could the 
French army have arrived in this country by the 
middle of this month, I am confident we could have 
obliged the enemy to have evacuated it. Reports say 
here your Excellency had a narrow escape through 
the Clove. Mrs. Greene joins me in respectful compliments to yourself and Mrs. Washington. 
</p><p>
With esteem and affection, I am, &c., 
</p><p>
