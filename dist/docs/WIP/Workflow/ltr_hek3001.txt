MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
I returned from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> to this place on the 
15th instant, and brought with me the cannon, &c.; it 
having taken nearly the time I conjectured it would 
to transport them here. It is not easy to conceive 
the difficulties we have had in getting them over the 
Lake, owing to the advanced season of the year, and 
contrary winds; three days ago it was very uncertain whether we could have gotten them over until 
next spring ; but now/ please God, they shall go. I 
have made forty-two exceedingly strong sleds, and 
have provided eighty yoke of oxen, to drag them as 
far as Springfield, where I shall get fresh cattle to 
carry them to camp. 
</p><p>
The route will be from here to Kinderhook, from 
thence into Great Barrington, in Massachusetts Bay, 
and down to Springfield. There will scarcely be any 
possibility of conveying them hence to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> or 
Kinderhook, but on sleds, the road being very much 
gullied. At present the sledding is tolerable to Sara 
toga, about twenty-six miles ; beyond that, there is 
none. I have sent for the sleds and teams to come 
up, and expect to begin to move them to <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> on 
Wednesday or Thursday next; trusting that between 
this and that period we shall have a fine fall of snow, which will enable us to proceed further and make 
the carriage easy. If that should be the case, I hope 
iri_^^teenjor t seventeen x days to be able to present to 
your Excellency a noble trarn~of artillery, the inventory of which I have inclosed. I have been particular with respect to their dimensions, that no mistake 
may be made in making their carriages, as there are 
none here, or implements of any kind. I also send 
a list of those stores, which I desired Colonel McDougall to send from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I did not then know 
of any thirteen-inch mortars, which was the reason 
of my ordering but few shells of that size; but I 
now write to him for five hundred one-inch, two 
hundred five-and-seven-tenths inches, and four hundred seven-and-one-half inches. If these sizes could 
be had there, as I believe they can, I should imagine 
it would save time and expense, rather than have 
them cast. If you should think otherwise, or have 
made provisions for them elsewhere, you will please 
to countermand this order.

There is no other news here of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>Colonel Arnold</a>, 
than that, from Colonel McLean's having burnt the 
houses round Quebec, <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>Colonel Arnold</a> was obliged to 
go to Point-aux-Trembles, about six miles from the 
city, and that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a> had gone to join 
him with a considerable body of men, and a good 
train of artillery, mortars, &c. 
</p><p>
There are some timid, and some malevolent spirits, 
who make this matter much worse ; but from the different accounts which I have been able to collect, I 
have very little doubt that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a> has 
Quebec now in his possession. I am, with the utmost 
respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant,
