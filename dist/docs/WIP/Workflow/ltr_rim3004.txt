SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received information, from different quarters, that the prisoners you have made are treated with cruel and unnecessary 
severity, being loaded with irons ; and that Colonel Allen himself meets with this shocking indignity. 
</p><p>
Your character, Sir, induces me to hope I am ill informed ; nevertheless, the duty I owe the troops committed to my charge, 
lays me under the necessity of acquainting your Excellency that, if you avow this conduct and persist in it, I shall, though with 
the most painful regret, execute with rigor the just and necessary law of retaliation upon the garrison of Chamblee, now in my 
possession, and upon all others who may hereafter fall into my hands. I must be understood to stipulate for those unfortunate 
Canadians, your prisoners, who have thrown themselves into the arms of the United Colonies for protection, whose enraged countrymen have with difficulty been restrained from acts of violence on the garrison of Chamblee. 
</p><p>
I shall expect your Excellency's answer in six days. Should the bearer not return in that time, I must interpret your silence 
into a declaration of a barbarous war. I cannot pass this opportunity, without lamenting the melancholy and fatal necessity which 
obliges the firmest friends of the Constitution to oppose one of the most respectable officers of the Crown. I am, &c.,
