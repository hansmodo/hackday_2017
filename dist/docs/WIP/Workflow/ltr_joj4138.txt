Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with yours of the 15th inst. by 
M r. Parkman ; am much pleased with him and his fellowtraveller, Mr. Cooledge. Their representation of the state 
of things in Massachusetts corresponds with the hints on that 
head suggested in your letter. There is too much intelligence in the northern states, to admit of their being greatly 
and long deceived and misled ; and I hope the same remark 
will in time become equally applicable to all the others. 
Considering the nature of our governments, a succession of 
demagogues must be expected : and the strenuous efforts 
of the wise and virtuous will not cease to be necessary to 
frustrate their artifices and designs. They will always be 
hostile to merit, because merit will always stand in their 
way ; and being actuated by envy, ambition, or avarice, 
and not unfrequently by them all, will be diligently at 
work, while better men will take their rest. 
</p><p>
It seems strange, but so it is in all republics, that many 
excellent men who are happy in their families and fortunes, 
and in the esteem of society and of their friends ; who enjoy their villas and their gardens, and neglect not to guard 
their trees and vines from caterpillars, and their favourite 
plants and flowers from nipping frosts ; yet omit attending 
to the political grubs, who are constantly and insidiously 
labouring to wound and prey upon the roots of all their temporal enjoyments. Several gentlemen of this description with us becoming alarmed, have been very useful ; 
and I presume this has been, more or less, the case in other 
States, 
Be assured of the esteem and regard with which I am, 
</p><p>
Yours, &c. 
</p><p>
