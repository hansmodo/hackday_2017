DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I wrote you yesterday to return to Strawberry, but, as you are so 
near, before you return I wish to see you, provided you come to Mr. 
Blake's to-night; but, if you should meet with your first express, and 
halt short of Mr. Blake s, you may return to the position recommended 
in that letter. However, I am of opinion, from a variety of reports, 
the enemy means to take the field in a few days, and that they have 
little less than 700 negroes armed for the purpose. The British horse 
were at Dorchester yesterday, but returned last night. 
I am, dear sir, your humble servant, 
</p><p>
