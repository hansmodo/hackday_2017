My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have just received and hastily read over your kind 
letter of the 27th and could write a great deal in answer 
to it if time or discretion would permit. This will 
merely serve as a cover to a newspaper, part of which 
I copied in my last. It goes by a man who is to set 
off immediately for York as I am informed by Col. Tilghman. I am exceedingly obliged to you for the 
</p><p>
gloves, and am ever 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.

I must detain the messenger, who ever he be, while 
I relate an anecdote, which will give you some idea 
of the general misbehaviour of our navy. 
</p><p>
When their retreat up the river was expected, the 
Delaware frigate was given over for lost her guns 
were taken out, and only a few men left in her who 
were to make their escape immediately upon an attack 
from our fleet which was looked upon as an event that 
would certainly happen and that could not be other 
wise than successful on our side. 
</p><p>
If it were the custom for generals to proclaim their 
intentions, we had a right to expect an attack to-day ; 
however, it is not amiss to he prepared for it. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> has joined us, and our forces are reunited. 
The enemy after razing Bilingsport and Red Bank 
have quitted the Jerseys altogether. It appears that 
two British captains were kill'd and two wounded in 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De La Fayette</a>'s combat. 
</p><p>
Upon looking into your letter again I see that I am 
indebted to a lady for the gloves; you will oblige me 
by saying something handsome for me. My letter 
alluded to, began in the manner which you describe ; 
it was a kind of journal which I had begun, and laid 
by in order to add to it occasionally.
