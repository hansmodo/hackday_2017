SIR: Though I have been extremely anxious to solicit your approbation, together with Mrs. Livingston's, in an affair which 
nearly concerns my happiness and no less affects your daughter. I have, nevertheless, been hitherto deterred from this indispensable attention by reflecting that from so short an acquaintance as I had the honor to make with you I could not 
flatter myself with your sanction in a matter so very important as to influence the future welfare of a child. I therefore wished 
for some good-natured friend to undertake the kind office of giving a favorable impression; but, finding you have already 
had intimation of my desire to be honored with your daughter's hand, and apprehensive lest my silence should bear an unfavorable construction, I have ventured at last to request, sir, that 
you and Mrs Livingston will consent to a union which to me has the most promising appearance of happiness, from the lady's 
uncommon merit and amiable worth. Nor will it be an inconsiderable addition to be favored by such respectable characters 
with the title of son, should I be so fortunate as to deserve it. And if to contribute to the happiness of a beloved daughter can 
claim any share with tender parents, I hope hereafter to have some title to your esteem.
</p><p> 
I am, sir. 
</p><p>
With great respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
