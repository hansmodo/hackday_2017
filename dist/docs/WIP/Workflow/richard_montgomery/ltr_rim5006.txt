MY DEAR JANET: 
</p><p>
I wrote to you by Harry, and hope you have some days ago had the pleasure of seeing him. I long to see you in your new 
house. Tf the winter set in soon don't forget to send for the lath to fence the garden, and also to have chestnut posts cut for the 
same purpose. I wish you could get a stove fixed in the hall they are the most comfortable things imaginable. 
</p><p>
The other day General Prescott was so obliging as to surrender himself and fourteen or fifteen land officers, with above 
one hundred men, besides sea officers and sailors, prisoners of war. I blush for His Majesty's troops! Such an instance of 
base poltroonery I never met with ! and all because we had half-a-dozen cannon on the bank of the river to annoy him in his retreat. The Governor escaped more 's the pity! Prescott, 
nevertheless, is a prize. He is a cruel rascal. I have treated him with the sovereign contempt his inhumanity and barbarity merit. 
</p><p>
To-morrow I hope to set out for <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, to join <a href="/results.php?tla=bea" rel="colleague met">Col. Arnold</a>, who is impatient to see us. His little army has undergone inexpressible hardships, and entered the country half-starved and 
half-naked. Should fortune continue her favor we may perhaps bring that business to a happy issue. In the meantime, adieu ! 
</p><p>
Believe me most affect'ly your 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rim" rel="me">RICHARD MONTGOMERY</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. I have no time to write to your <a href="/results.php?tla=rol" rel="kin met">father</a>. I have been overwhelmed with business, and am out of all patience at being obliged to spend so much of this precious season in this town. 
</p><p>
My most affectionate respects attend the old gentleman and lady. My love to the girls. Do they go to town? No husbands this winter? Alas ! 
</p><p>
I live in hopes to see you in six weeks.
