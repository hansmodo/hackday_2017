MY DEAR JANET : 
</p><p>
It is with inexpressible concern I find by a letter from 
your <a href="/results.php?tla=rol" rel="kin met">father</a> that you are ill. I wish he had kept the intelligence a secret ; I do not want any addition to my uneasiness. 
That this may find you recovered is my warmest wish ! 
</p><p>
Little change has happened since my last. 1 still wait for reinforcement ; the troops have hitherto gone home sick, almost 
as fast as they came. We have been like half-drowned rats crawling thro' the swamp, but the weather is now much altered 
for the better, and I hope it will continue. I believe we shall in a few days set about our business in earnest. If powder don't 
fail us, 1 think we shall finish this affair. I have had overtures for an accommodation from St. Luke Le Come, and some other 
principal people of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a>. He is a great villain and as cunning as the devil, but I have sent a New Englander to negotiate with him. 
</p><p>
Had we twice or thrice as many men, everything would long ago have been settled. All the lower class of people are 
anxious for our success, but have been intimidated much by our weakness, lest by a miscarriage they should be left to the vengeance of tyranny. 
</p><p>
I am extremely sorry to hear of your <a href="/results.php?tla=rol" rel="kin met">father's</a> indisposition and your mother's, but hope most sincerely their health may by 
this time be reestablished. My affectionate duty attends them and also your grandfather. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear Janet ; believe me ever yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rim" rel="me">RICHARD MONTGOMERY</a>.
