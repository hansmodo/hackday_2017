Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr Short has delivered to me within these few days your 
favor of the twenty-eighth of July. I cannot express to you 
what I felt on reading it. The view which it gives of our prosperity as a nation swelled my bosom with emotions, which none 
can know but those who have experienced them. The wonderful change, which has been effected in our affairs by the 
operation of the general government, has exceeded the pre 
dictions of its warmest friends. How great a source of joy is 
this to those, who have been at all instrumental in its formation and establishment ; those especially to whom Providence 
in its bounty has imparted a sincere affection for their fellow 
men. Yes, my dear Sir, man is not merely a selfish, nor a 
material being, and I attest your heart to witness the truth 
from the conviction of its own feelings.

The King has at length, as you will have seen, accepted the 
new constitution, and been in consequence liberated from his arrest. It is a general and almost universal conviction that this constitution is inexecutable. The makers to a man condemn it. Judge 
what must be the opinion of others. Mr Short will doubtless 
forward all the public documents respecting it, and therefore 
1 shall not trouble you with any of them. His majesty is to 
go in about an hour hence to close the session of the National 
Assembly, and then they leave the field to their successors. 
His present business is to make himself popular ; indeed his life 
and crown depend upon it ; for the constitution is such, that he 
must soon be more or less than he is at present, and fortunately he begins to think so, but unfortunately his advisers have 
neither the sense nor the spirit, which the occasion calls for. 
</p><p>
The new Assembly, as far as can at present be determined, 
is deeply imbued with republican or rather democratical principles. The southern part of this kingdom is in the same disposition. The northern is ecclesiastical in its temper. The 
eastern is attached to Germany, and would gladly be reunited 
to the empire. Normandy is aristocratical. and so is part of Britany. The interior part of the kingdom is monarchical. 
This map is (you may rely on it) just, for it is the result of great 
and expensive investigations made by government, and I think 
you will be able by the help of it, and of the few observations 
which precede it, fully to understand many things, which would 
not otherwise perhaps be so easily unriddled. You doubtless 
recollect that the now expiring Assembly was convened to ar 
range the finances, and you will perhaps be surprised to learn, 
that after consuming church property to the amount of one 
hundred millions sterling, they leave this department much 
worse than they found it. Such however is the fact, and the 
chance now is, in my opinion, rather for than against a bankruptcy. 
</p><p>
The aristocrats, who are gone and going in great numbers to 
join the refugee princes, believe sincerely in a coalition- of the 
powers of Europe to reinstate their sovereign in his ancient 
authorities ; but I believe they are very much mistaken. Nothing of consequence can be attempted this year, and many things 
may happen before the month of June next, were the several 
potentates in earnest. I am led to imagine, that their views are 
very different from those which are now assigned to them, and 
it is very far from impossible that the attempt, if any, will, so 
far as France is concerned, be confined to a dismemberment. 
The weak side of this kingdom, as matters now stand, is Flanders ; but were the provinces of Alsace, Lorraine, French Flanders, and Artois rent away, the capital would be constantly ex 
posed to the visits from an enemy. These provinces were, you 
know, acquired at an immense expense of blood and treasure, 
and if Louis the Fourteenth could have succeeded in making 
the Rhine his boundary, from Switzerland to the ocean, he 
would have obtained the advantages almost of an insular position. 
Indeed it is difficult to abstain from the wish, that the countries 
included within that boundary were united under a free efficient 
government, since it would, in all human probability, be the 
means of dispensing the blessings of freedom in no distant period to all Europe. But on this subject it is now permitted to 
a rational being to form rather wishes than hopes, much less 
expectations.

I will enclose herein a note just now received of the latest 
intelligence from Coblentz. It is written by the Prince de Conde to his confidential friend here, and is accompanied by 
the request that all French gentlemen, capable of actual service, 
will immediately repair to the standard of royalty beyond the 
Rhine, or rather on the banks of that river. To the troops 
mentioned in this note are added by the counter revolutionists 
here 15,000 Hessians and 16,000 French refugees, so that 
exclusively of what the Emperor may bring forward, they muster an army, on paper, of 100,000 men. The Emperor has 
about 5,000 men in the low countries. But all these appearances, and the proposed Congress of Ambassadors at Aix la Chapelle, do not in the least change my opinion, that nothing 
serious will be attempted this year. 
</p><p>
M. de Montmorin has resigned, and the Count de Moustier 
is named as his successor, but whether he will accept seems to 
be very doubtful. He is now at Berlin, and as he is an intimate of M. de Calonne, who is one mainspring of the counter revolution, he is, I presume, in the secret of what may be 
really in agitation. This on one side ; and on the other an 
office, the power and authority of which are just nothing at all; 
for you will observe, that by the new constitution every treaty 
and convention whatever must be submitted to the investigation of the Assembly to be by them accepted or rejected. 
</p><p>
You will have seen I suppose, ere this arrives, what has been 
done here respecting the colonies. It is supposed that, they 
will be perfectly satisfied, because their internal legislation is 
left to themselves ; but I much doubt this, for their commerce, which involves their existence, is left entirely at the 
mercy of the Assembly, which will not be over attentive to their 
interests, when they fall into competition with those of the 
mother country. 
</p><p>
I send out to Mr Morris a bundle of pamphlets written 
here by a M. de Cormere, according to hints and observations 
which I furnished to him. Mr Morris will give you one, and 
you will see that it was calculated to produce a liberal system of 
colonial government, beneficial to them and to us. In order 
to bring it about, it was proposed that commissioners should be 
sent out with full powers to treat with the colonial Assemblies, 
and could that have been carried, this pamphlet would have 
been the groundwork of the instructions. The proposition was 
rejected, but as it is more than probable, that the colonies will 
have had a full taste of the sweets of free trade before the 
troubles are composed, and as they will have learnt that fear 
can produce what reason could not, I do expect that at length 
this government must come into some such measure, and there 
by not only the stumbling block will be taken out of the way 
to a useful treaty between France and the United States, but 
at the same time, and by the same means, the road will be laid 
open for solid connexion with Great Britain. 
</p><p>
In all cases we have the consolation, that if the powers of 
Europe by their excluding principles deprive us of the needful vent for our produce, which becomes daily more and more 
abundant, we shall, from the cheapness of living and of raw 
materials, which results from that circumstance, make great and rapid progress in useful manufactures. This alone is wanting 
to complete our independence. We shall then be, as it were, 
a world by ourselves, and far from the jars and wars of Europe, 
their various revolutions will serve merely to instruct and 
amuse ; like the roaring of a tempestuous sea, which at a certain distance becomes a pleasing sound. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear Sir ; that you may be well and happy is 
the sincere wish of yours, &tc.
