MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
You must not flatter yourself with the expectation 
of hearing from Colonel Smith until the February 
packet arrives. It is as soon as you ought to think of 
it. You see by the papers, that a minister is in nomination from England, and, Mrs. C writes, will come out soon. Mrs. P , from whom I received 
a letter, writes me by the last packet, that Mr. Friere 
is certainly appointed from Portugal, and that he 
only waits for the arrival of Count , his successor, in England, before he sails for America. Mrs. P likewise communicates the agreeable intelligence of Mr. P 's having forsaken the bottle, and 
that the Countess B had another child, and was vastly happy, beloved by her dear Count, &c. ; all in the true style of Mrs. P . She desires to be kindly remembered to you and the Colonel. 
</p><p>
Present me kindly to all my <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> friends. 
That I was attached to that place is most true, and I 
shall always remember with pleasure the fifteen 
months passed there ; but, if I had you and your family, I could be very well pleased here, for there is an 
agreeable society and friendliness kept up with all 
the principal families, who appear to live in great 
harmony, and we meet at all the parties nearly the 
same company. To-morrow the President dines 
with us, the Governor, the Ministers of State, and 
some Senators. Of all the ladies I have seen and 
conversed with here, Mrs. Powell is the best informed. She is a friendly, affable, good woman, sprightly, full of conversation. There is a Mrs. Allen, 
who is as well-bred a woman as I have seen in any 
country, and has three daughters, who may be styled 
the three Graces. 
</p><p>
My best respects to your good mamma and family. 
</p><p>
Tell Mrs. C I hope she makes a very obedient wife. I am sure she will be a good one. I think I 
shall see you in April. Why do you say that you 
feel alone in the world ? I used to think that I felt 
so too ; but, when I lost my mother, and afterwards 
my father, that " alone " appeared to me in a much 
more formidable light. It was like cutting away 
the main pillars of a building ; and, though no friend 
can supply the absence of a good husband, yet, 
whilst our parents live, we cannot feel unprotected. 
To them we can apply for advice and direction, 
sure that it will be given with affection and tenderness. We know not what we can do or bear, till 
called to the trial. I have passed through many 
painful ones, yet have enjoyed as much happiness 
through life as usually falls to the lot of mortals ; 
and, when my enjoyments have been damped, curtailed, or molested, it has not been owing to vice, 
that great disturber of human happiness, but sometimes to folly, in myself or others, or the hand of 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, which has seen fit to afflict me. I feel 
grateful for the blessings which surround me, and 
murmur not at those which are withheld. But my 
pen runs on, and my lads, at whose table I write, 
wonder what mamma can find to write about. 
</p><p>
Adieu. My love to the children. From your ever 
affectionate 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
