Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Possessing no official situation, which entitles me to offer my sentiments on political measures, I may 
possibly be deemed intrusive when I offer my unasked advice. But, Sir, feeling the same ardent love 
for my country, which has so frequently, in times of danger and difficulty, served as an apology for my 
letters, I still presume, without any other than that which arises from my solicitude, in the present alarming situation of our affairs, to offer you the unbiased 
sentiments of a citizen, whose whole life has been employed in endeavouring to understand, and, as far 
as in him lay, in promoting the interests of his country; of one, who considers your glory as closely connected with that interest, and who views the present 
as a favorable moment to place it above the reach of party violence, and to procure to yourself a second 
time, by the common consent of America, the endearing appellation of the saviour of your country. 
</p><p>
In my present retired situation, I have carefully read and considered the treaty with England. I see 
in it not the slightest satisfaction for our wrongs. I see them, in some instances, authorized. In the commercial part, I see articles, which, though professing 
to be mutual, are in no sort reciprocal. I see a want 
of precision in many, which may involve us in frequent disputes. But, above all, I dread, in the ratification of the treaty, an immediate rupture with 
France, where (as I am informed by letters from thence) the very apprehension has already excited very disagreeable sensations. To discuss these points, 
or even to dwell on the construction which France may put on the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth articles, would be an unnecessary waste of your time, since 
the objections to them could not have escaped your discernment; and they may possibly admit of a construction variant from that, which they at first view 
appear to carry with them. But, at any rate, they were unnecessary, and peculiarly improper at the present moment. 
</p><p>
There are two other articles which, though less pointed at, France can hardly, in my opinion, consider 
as much short of a direct declaration of hostilities. By the twenty-seventh article, it is expressly admitted 
that enemies' property, on board of American ships, is liable to capture. This is, at least, a question of considerable doubt, since the general assent of civilized 
nations to the principle of the armed neutrality, Britain alone dissenting. And surely this was a very improper moment to turn that doubt into a certainty, 
to the injury of ourselves and our allies. By the latter part of the twelfth article, this question, it seems. is again to be revived, within two years after the war. 
Now, as this question is capable of discussion as well at this as at any future time, and as it depends in no sort upon the war, what other construction can 
France possibly put upon this delay than a tacit agreement between us and Britain to aid her, even at our own expense, in her determined hostility to 
that Republic, while we were availing ourselves of a contrary principle to protect the property of her rival? 
</p><p>
This argument derives additional force from the eighteenth article, which, notwithstanding what we 
have suffered from the British construction of siege and blockade, leaves it still undefined, and, of course, 
agreeably to a known principle of the law of nations (Vat. 2d lib. 27th cap.), acquiesces in their absurd 
and unlimited constructions, and enables them, as I am just informed they have done, to renew their 
attempt to starve France and her Colonies. In our treaty with France, tar, turpentine, cordage, masts, 
sails, plank, &c., are expressly declared not to be contraband. By this treaty, all these articles are 
made contraband. Upon what principle can France suppose that we entered into this stipulation at this 
time, and in the very face of our proclamation, by which you refer to the modern law of nations for a 
just definition of the word contraband, unless it were to distress them ? 
</p><p>
Pardon me. Sir, on the score of my solicitude for the peace and welfare of my country, if I intrude 
upon your time and patience. I dread a war with France, as the signal for a civil war at home. She 
can, and I greatly fear that she will, should the treaty be ratified, compel us to enter the lists by 
claiming the effect of our guaranty of the Islands. Rent, as our country unhappily is, by parties, nothing 
but personal consideration for your virtues can attach the public confidence to the measures of Government; 
nothing but your glory can save, under these circumstances, the honor of our nation. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
