SIR: 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the and , and I now enclose you a copy of a letter from Governor Burke, which explains what Ganey 
has been for some time past complaining of. I hope you will pay 
particular attention to Gov. Burke's requisition, that none of the disaffected of his State may be suffered to harbor with Ganey and his party; 
and it would be well to apprize him that if, when driven out of North 
Carolina, they are sheltered by any of his party in this State, it will be 
deemed an infraction of the truce, and consequently the North Carolinians will have a right to enter th e neutral ground, and apprehend 
the fellows wherever they are found. If it can be clearly proved that 
the truce has been violated on their part, how far it might be advisable 
for you to co-operate with the North Carolinians, and by one decisive 
blow crush this infamous banditti, I must leave with you to determine. 
As to the proposal you make respecting Maham's and <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> corps, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> and myself having fully considered that matter, have given 
you our opinion thereon, which I suppose you have received ere this. 
But should there be any great difficulty in carrying our determination into 
execution, I have no objection to adopting the mode you now propose, 
if <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> approves of it, except that part " to recruit Maham's 
corps to one hundred and twenty men/ as the time of service of the 
men will expire in July, therefore, it would not be worth while to incur 
the expense. I am very glad you have got some negroes for the recruiting service. I wish Col. Grimke would continue to furnish you with 
them, and not wait for my orders, which I can give him hereafter, when 
I know the quantity delivered to you. The orders you have lately received from me renders it unnecessary to say anything now respecting 
Mr. Philip Porcher. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, I have seen <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, and he approves 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> corps being continued as infantry, agreeable to your proposal. 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
