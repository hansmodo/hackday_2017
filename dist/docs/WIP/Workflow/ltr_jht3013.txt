SIR, 
</p><p>
I received, the 20th of last month, your Excellency's favor of the 15th, inclosing a list of the officers and companies under the new arrangement, with 
the number of men enlisted ; and, at the same time, 
another of the 17th, with the information from several persons who then had lately come out of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
I return my thanks for both. 
</p><p>
By accounts received from the various parts of the 
Colony, the recruiting officers, for the Continental 
service, have good success in enlisting men. 
</p><p>
The Assembly have granted Chaplains the same 
pay given last campaign, with the addition of forty 
shillings per month each, to enable them to supply 
their pulpits. 
</p><p>
Brigadier-General Prescott is not arrived. Shall give 
particular directions to prevent his escape, if he comes 
into this Colony. 
</p><p>
The 23d, yours of the 14th of December came to hand, per Messieurs Penet and De Pliarne. Every 
necessary assistance, for expediting their journey, was afforded without delay ; they set out the next 
morning. You shall be made acquainted with the Expense incurred on their account, when the same is known. 
</p><p>
The 28th instant, at evening, our General Assembly 
adjourned. There is great unanimity in our common 
cause. Among others, they passed an act for raising 
and equipping one fourth part of the militia of this 
Colony, to be forthwith selected by voluntary enlistment, with as many other able bodied, effective men, 
not included in any militia-roll, as are inclined to 
enlist, to stand in readiness as minute-men, for the 
defence of this and the rest of the United Colonies, 
with proper encouragement. Another act, for restraining  and punishing persons who are inimical to the 
liberties of this and the rest of the United Colonies, 
and for directing proceedings therein. No person to 
supply the Ministerial army or navy ; to give intelligence ; to enlist, or procure others to enlist in their 
service ; to undertake to pilot any of their vessels, or 
in any other ways to aid or assist them, on the penalty of forfeiting all his estate, and imprisonment in 
any of the jails in this Colony, not exceeding three 
years. No one to speak, write, &c., against the doing's of the Honorable General Congress, or acts of 
our Assembly, on the penalty of being disarmed, and 
rendered incapable to hold, or serve in any office, 
civil or military ; and be further punished, either by 
fine, imprisonment, disfranchisement, or to find surety 
of the peace and good behaviour. 
</p><p>
Any person or persons, who put, or shall continue 
to hold, or screen themselves under, the protection of 
the Ministerial army or navy, or aid or assist in carrying into execution the present Ministerial measures 
against America, their estates to be seized for the 
use of the Colony. 
</p><p>
A resolve to provide, so that we shall have two armed vessels, one of sixteen carriage-guns, the other fourteen ; with a schooner called the Spy, of four carriage-guns ; and four row-galleys. 
</p><p>
An act to exempt the polls of soldiers from taxes, for the last, and ensuing campaigns. Another act, for encouraging the manufactories of saltpetre and gunpowder. 
</p><p>
Hope to collect saltpetre and manufacture a considerable quantity of gunpowder early in the spring. The furnace, at Middletown, is smelting lead, and likely to turn out twenty or thirty tons. Ore is plenty. 
</p><p>
Please to favor me with an account of the quantity 
of lead received from Crown Point. From thence I 
received one hundred and eighty old gunbarrels, 
which are fitting up here, and will make one hundred 
and fifty stands of good arms. We are put to difficulty for gunlocks. Hearing that those stands, taken 
in the ordnance store-ship, had each a spare lock, thought proper to mention to you, that, if it be so, 
whether it may not be well to furnish a number for the arms fitting here. 
</p><p>
On the 29th, at evening, I met, at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, on 
my returning from the General Assembly, yours of 
the 23d December, and immediately sent to Captain 
Wads worth, a person employed by the Commissary-General, and much acquainted, to see if any blankets 
could be purchased, and found there are none. Many 
of our new-enlisted men, I am told, will bring blankets with them, which they get from private families. 
Those lost at the Bunker Hill fight were furnished 
in that manner, and our minute-men will supply 
themselves in that way ; but I am very doubtful of 
success, if attempted. Lieutenant-Colonel Durkee this 
day mentioned to me your direction to him on this 
head. Shall lay the same before the Committee at our next meeting.

I remain, with great truth and regard, and with the proper salutations of this day, your Excellency's Most obedient, humble servant,
