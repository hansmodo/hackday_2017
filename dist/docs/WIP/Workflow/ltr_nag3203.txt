SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 22d was delivered 
to me this afternoon. I am happy to find you have 
wrote so fully to Congress, upon the disagreeable consequences that may follow from starving the Quarter 
master's department at this critical season. I wish it 
may have the desired effect, and rouse their attention; but I must confess I am afraid the stupor is 
so great, that nothing can alarm their fears, or pro 
mote a spirit of industry. 
</p><p>
I had but very little prospect, from my own application, of obtaining the necessary supplies of cash. 
What additional influence your Excellency's letter will 
give to my reasons and representation, time only can 
manifest. 
</p><p>
The treasury appears to be hard pressed on every 
side ; and the demands of this time are infinitely 
greater than it is in their power to satisfy with the 
greatest exertions, upon the present plan of striking money. The truth of the affair is, there has been a 
great degree of negligence and want of timely attention, to prepare seasonably for the present demands. 
When I was in town in the winter, I reported to the 
Treasury Board what I thought would be absolutely 
necessary for the Quarter-master's department to the 
2d of March; not one half of which have we been 
able to get, although every thing has been urged to 
induce them to supply our wants. 
</p><p>
On my arrival here, I laid your Excellency's letter 
respecting wagoners, before a Committee of Congress. 
They immediately confirmed it by a resolution, not 
withstanding they had been hammering upon the 
business for almost two months, off and on; and 
finally had put it (before the receipt of your letter) 
upon a very restrictive plan. 
</p><p>
The business of financing is in a poor way. There 
is no plan found, or scheme digested, for mending our money. There are a thousand projects on foot; but 
none appears to be taken up on a practical footing. 
</p><p>
There are complaints and murmurings in Congress 
against the people of this State, and the people of 
the State complain against the proceedings of Con 
gress. It is said, days and weeks together are spent 
upon the most trifling disputes in the world; and 
those generally of a personal nature. What will be 
the issue of this policy", I know not, 
</p><p>
I have wrote circular letters to all the deputies in 
my department on the east side of the Susquehanna, 
to enlist as many wagoners as they possibly can by 
the middle of next month; and to have all the pub 
lic teams forwarded so as to be in camp by that 
time. I expect our wagon-horses will fall short, as 
our agents have but a scanty supply of money. 
However, I will do the best I can. 
</p><p>
I wish to know whether I must increase the number of pack-horses. Orders have been given for one thousand; but <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> thinks near five hundred more will be wanted. It does not appear so to 
me ; but I am not a good judge of the business. 
The Board of War are out of lead ; and I fear the 
ammunition will not be ready. This is only conjectural. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency before, that the Minister 
of France sets out for camp on Tuesday next. Don 
Juan will accompany him. There is a French ship 
just arrived from the West Indies; but I cannot 
learn that she brings any thing new. 
</p><p>
I intended to have set out for camp to-morrow, 
but I believe I shall not be ready until Monday in 
the forenoon. I have desired Congress to give me leave to resign, as I apprehended a loss of reputation, if I continued in the business. They are not 
disposed to grant my request at all. But unless 
they change their system, or publish their approbation upon the present, I shall not remain long in the 
business. I will not sacrifice my reputation for any 
consideration whatever. I am willing to serve the 
public ; but I think I have a right to choose that 
way of performing the service which will be most 
honorable to myself. I should be willing to serve in 
the department I am in for a proper consideration, if 
I could serve without the loss of reputation; but not 
without. 
</p><p>
I believe it has been a received opinion, that I 
was so very fond of the emoluments of the Quarter 
master's office, that nothing but absolute necessity 
would induce me to quit it, I will not deny but 
that the profits are flattering to my fortune, but not 
less humbling to my military pride; and he who has 
entertained such sentiments is a stranger to my feelings. While I had a prospect of pleasing your Excellency, the army, and the Congress, the service 
was agreeable ; but if a combination of circumstances 
changes these prospects, nothing shall induce me to 
continue in the business, even if the profits were 
made five times as large as they are. 
</p><p>
There is a great difference between being raised to 
an office and descending to one ; which is my case. 
There is also a great difference between serving where 
you have a fair prospect of honor and laurels, and 
where you have no prospect of either, let you discharge your duty ever so well. Nobody ever heard 
of a Quarter-master in history, as such, or in relating 
any brilliant action. I engaged in this business as 
well out of compassion to your Excellency as from a 
regard to the public. I thought your task too great, 
to be Commander-in-chief and Quarter-master at the 
same time. Money was not my motive. For you may 
remember I offered to serve a year unconnected with 
the accounts, without any additional pay to that which 
I had as Major-General. However, this proposition 
was rejected as inadmissible. Then I told the Committee that I would serve upon the same terms that 
Mr. Cox and Mr. Pettit could be engaged upon; and 
I have nothing more now, although I have a double 
share of duty, and am held responsible for all failures. 
</p><p>
Before I came into the department, your Excellency 
was obliged often to stand Quarter-master. However 
capable the principal was of doing his duty, he was 
hardly ever with you. The line and the staff were 
at war with each other. The country had been plundered in a way that would now breed a kind of civil 
war between the staff and the inhabitants. The manner of my engaging in this business, and your Excellency's declaration to the Committee of Congress, 
that you would stand Quarter-master no longer, are 
circumstances which I wish may not be forgotten ; as 
I may have occasion, at some future day, to appeal 
to your Excellency for my own justification. 
One thing I can say, with truth and sincerity, that 
I have conducted the business with as much prudence and economy, as if my private fortune had 
been answerable for the disbursements. And I believe your Excellency will do me the justice to say, 
the department has cooperated with your measures 
as far as circumstances were to be governed by me ; 
and this you had reason to apprehend would not 
have been the case had I not taken direction of the 
business. And here, in justice to my colleagues, I 
shall mention that I think them entitled to your Excellency's personal esteem, from the warmth of 
their wishes, and a desire to promote your ease and 
convenience. 
</p><p>
I am more acquainted with Mr. Pettit's mode of 
doing business than I am with Mr. Cox's ; but I 
think the public under great obligations to the for 
mer for his method and economy. I am, with the 
most perfect esteem, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant,
