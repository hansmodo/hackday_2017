Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... In respect to <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a> &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr Van Buren</a> I have not the slightest fear of either of them, or both of them. 
Our country-men are not naturally disposed to cut their own throats to please any body, &amp; I have so perfect a reliance 
on the spirit &amp; sense of the nation, that I think we can defend the institution from much stronger enemies than they 
are. In doing this we must endeavour to reach the understandings of our fellow citizens by the diffusion of correct 
views of a subject which is much understood. You will receive herewith a copy of condensed analysis of <a href='/results.php?tla=alg' rel='colleague'>Mr Gallatin's</a> 
article on Banks, so far as it relates to the B.U.S. . . .
