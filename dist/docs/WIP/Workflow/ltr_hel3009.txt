DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I had the honor of writing to your Excellency a public letter by James Martin, and also 
of presenting to Congress your Excellency's favor of 
the 14th, which the House received with satisfaction. 
</p><p>
Permit me, Sir, to recommend to your Excellency's protection two packets from the Sieur Gerard to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel=''>Count D Estaing</a>, which will accompany this. I have 
assured Monsieur Gerard that it is altogether unnecessary to urge your Excellency to give these despatches the quickest safe passage to the Vice-Admiral. 
</p><p>
Prizes are finding the way into the Delaware. One, 
laden with rum, limes, &c., intended for the enemy's 
refreshment, embraced one of our wharves the evening before last, and I learn a rich ship is on her way 
up. 
</p><p>
I have this moment received a second letter from 
the British Commissioners. If I dared to venture an 
opinion, from a very cursory reading of the performance, it would be that this is more puerile than any 
thing I have seen from the other side since the commencement of our present dispute, with a little dash 
of insolence, as unnecessary as it will be unavailing. 
If the Marquis de Vienne will indulge me, till I 
return from Congress, your Excellency will find a 
copy of that letter within this. At present, as he is 
on the wing, I must send to obtain his permission ; 
and in order to be quite ready, in case he shall re 
fuse to wait, I conclude this with repeated assurances 
of being, with the highest esteem and respect, dear Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Obliged and obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. Returned from Congress at 9 o clock. A 
resolve, relative to the Commissioners letter, that it 
ought not to be answered, &c., with the letter, will 
appear in print. 
</p>
