ROBERT HOWE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE HONORABLE CONVENTION OF NORTH CAROLINA.

SIR: 
</p><p>
I have the honor to transmit you, by the Hon. <a href="/results.php?tla=wid" rel="colleague met">Mr. Drayton</a>, the copy 
of a resolution of the Council of this State, for obtaining the aid of 
1,500 minute men, or militia men, from North Carolina, for a certain 
time; and, as I have been applied to by his Excellency, the President, 
to take every measure necessary to enforce this request, I take the 
liberty of troubling you upon this subject, fully persuaded that to induce your assistance to a sister State, nothing more is requisite than to 
show the necessity for it. My letter to you of yesterday in a great 
measure anticipates what I should otherwise have to say upon this occasion, because the same motives urged to obtain a permission for their 
officers to recruit, militate in favor of granting the request they now 
make. Suffice it, then, to say, that they are not in themselves equal to 
any very formidable invasion, and yet have every reason to expect one 
this winter; that they have innate foes, who wait but for an opportunity 
to rebel who would fly to the banners of the enemy; several numerous 
tribes of Indians on their backs, whose present temper bears a very 
alarming construction; their militia but few, and those so divided and 
remote, as not to be collected in time for any sudden emergency, and 
not sufficient in number when they -are got together; that, therefore, 
any aid which is to be sought for will, in all probability, arrive too late, 
the fatal consequence of which are too serious and melancholy to be 
dwelt upon. In this situation of danger and necessity, they apply to 
you for assistance, and the mode they have fallen upon seems calculated 
to obtain it without injury to you. The pay of their militia is more 
than equal to the labor of any common man the rations more than sufficient for any appetite the barracks they have built, comfortable 
and roomy. This, I presume, will induce your men to come willingly, 
especially at this idle season of the year, and the expense will be all 
their own. Upon these terms, I imagine, the aid they ask would be 
granted by any neighboring State, less zealous in the cause than yours. 
I should injure you, therefore, whose patriotic disposition and generous 
spirit I am so well acquainted with, were I to admit a doubt of your 
yielding them every assistance in your power. One benefit which may 
arise to you, particularly from this measure, is, that it may probably 
make it unnecessary to call away your regulars, who, by that means, 
will keep you in a state of security. The gentleman who visits you upon 
this occasion will fully explain to you every thing relative to this matter. His rank, character and capacity, can not but make him an object 
of your respect and attention. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, sir, 
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=roh" rel="me">ROBERT HOWE</a>. 
</p><p>
Resolved, That <a href='/results.php?tla=wid' rel='colleague'>Mr. Drayton</a> be sent to North Carolina to solicit 
1,500 minute men or militia, to be immediately marched into this State, 
and remain here for two months from the time of their arrival, who 
should be allowed such pay and rations as are allowed to our own 
militia from the time of their setting out until their return; and that 
in case the exigencies of this State should, in the opinion of the President and Council, require it, they may retain them two months longer 
than the time above mentioned.
