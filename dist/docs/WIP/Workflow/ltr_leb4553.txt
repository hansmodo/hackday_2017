Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter you addressed to me yesterday, 
as also the accompanying papers. I sent a copy of them immediately to the Minister of the Marine, praying him to take 
the most prompt measures to procure for Captain Todd the 
satisfaction due to him, and to prevent, for the future, the 
vessels of our good allies from being exposed to the attacks of 
our ships of war and privateers.

The inconvenience, which many of your fellow citizens have lately experienced, arises in part from the difficulty of distinguishing an American from an English vessel; and from the 
connivance there may be, among many individuals of both 
nations, for making disguised expeditions. In order to pre 
serve to the citizens of the United States all the advantages, 
which result from their neutrality, it is the interest of the 
American Government to prevent this fraud ; and I have every 
reason to believe, that the laws which determine, in the United 
States, the national flag, are clear and precise. I know that 
these laws require not only that the vessels be of American 
construction, but that the Captain and a great part of the 
crew be Americans. 
</p><p>
I pray you, Sir, to communicate to me the last statute made 
on this subject by Congress, that I may give information of it to 
the officers of our ports, and through them to the commanders 
of our ships of war. This measure seems to me essential, in 
order to prevent all the disputes, which might arise on this 
subject. 
</p><p>
In my last letter I assured you of the sincere desire of the 
French Republic, not only carefully to avoid whatever might 
disturb the perfect harmony between the two nations, but to 
draw more and more closely the fraternal bonds which unite 
them. You have seen proofs of this in the various decrees, 
which have been passed by the National Convention, in 
favor of the commerce of the United States. I have the 
honor to be, &c.
