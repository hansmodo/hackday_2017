MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received yours of the 7th. I have written 
you on every post day. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> is so anxious 
to obtain money here to enable him to discharge 
some of the most urgent demands upon the United 
States, and preserve their credit from bankruptcy for 
two years longer, after which he thinks the new government will have money in their treasury from taxes, 
that he has prevailed upon me to open a new loan by 
virtue of my old power. I was very much averse to 
this, but he would take no denial. I shall, therefore, 
be detained here till Monday, but if my health continues, I shall cross over in the packet of next Wednesday. I hope every thing will be ready for us to take 
post for Falmouth.

The rich complain at present in Holland, that the 
poor are set over them in the regencies, and the old 
families that they are set aside by new ones. Discontent 
rankles deep in some places and among some sorts of 
men, but the common people appear to be much 
pleased. The patriots in this country were little read 
in history, less in government ; knew little of the human heart and still less of the world. They have, 
therefore, been the dupes of foreign politics and their 
own indigested systems. Changes may happen and 
disorders may break out, though at present there is 
no apparent probability of either ; but as there is no 
sense of the necessity of uniting and combining the 
great divisions of society in one system, no changes 
can happen for the better. 
</p><p>
My love to the children, and believe me very anxious to see you.
