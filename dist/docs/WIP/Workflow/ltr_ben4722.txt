REV. SIR, 
</p><p>
With cordial Thanks for your many Civilities to me when in Paris, I take this Opportunity of acquainting you, that 
your Certificate has been received by the Royal Society, 
and ordered to be hung up the usual Time which is ten 
Meetings; but it was observed to be deficient in not mentioning your Christian Name, without which it is not 
reckon'd regular. I therefore pray you would send me that 
Name, to be inserted in the Certificate; in order to remove 
the Objection. With great Esteem & Respect, I am 
Sir John Pringle desires Rev d Sir 
to be remembered to you Your most obliged 
with Respect & obed' hum'l Serv' 
</p><p>
B. F.
