Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last will accompany this, and I enclose herein the co 
pies of letters from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the tenth, 
fourteenth, and seventeenth instants, and also copies of mine to 
him of the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and also one just written. 
</p><p>
By his letter of the tenth, you will see the determination to 
act decisively. In a subsequent conversation he assured me, 
that Genet should be punished. I replied that the United 
States had only ordered me to ask his recall, and I could go no 
farther. The idea is to send over a Commission of three or 
four persons; and to authorise that board to send him over a prisoner. I kept the advice boat here a week, in order to em 
bark the Commissioners on board of her. But although the 
instructions are all ready, there remains some little embarrassment about the appointment of one of the persons. This 
prevents them from being ready ; and, as it appears to me 
very important that you should have early advice, I cannot 
by any longer delay risk the near approach of winter on the 
American coast. 
</p><p>
It is probable that the successor of M. Genet may ask the 
interposition of our government in the discussions likely to 
arise. I have given assurances to the extent of what our laws 
and constitution may authorise. You will be able to measure 
better than I can that extent, and, at any rate, this hint will be 
kept secret, for that is, as you will readily see, of the utmost 
importance. 
</p><p>
In M. Deforgues letter of the fourteenth, and the decree 
which accompanied it, you will see the reasons assigned for 
violating the treaty. You will see, also, that it was not from 
the difficulty of refuting them, that I declined entering into 
the controversy. In effect, he had acknowledged and lamented to me the impropriety of the decree, but, unable to prevail 
over a greater influence for the repeal of it, he is driven to 
the necessity of excusing a step, which it is not possible to 
justify. There is no use in arguing with those who are alrea 
dy convinced ; and, where no good is expected, some evil 
may follow. I have, therefore, only stated the question on its 
true ground, and leave to you in America to insist on a rigid 
performance of the treaty, or slide back to the equal state of 
unfettered neutrality. Your orders will, of course, be given 
to me according to the determination, which the President 
shall take, and until then I hold the matter open. 
</p><p>
We have constantly the news of victory, but the public is 
incredulous. Lately orders were expedited to attack in every quarter; and as this is a measure originating with the 
government, those who pretend to judge of intelligence be 
forehand, say, that it must be favorable. There is, at any 
rate, the resource of concealing it, and although it would, at 
first sight, appear next to impossible that, in a country flooded 
with gazettes, there should he no note of long and bloody 
battles, yet the severity of the decrees against those who discourage the exertions of the Republic, and the greater severity 
with which all such decrees are executed, awe the boldest 
printers, and hush even the whispers of private information. 
You must not be surprised, therefore, to find in the Dutch 
and English gazettes the account of actions, which are passed 
over in silence by those I send you. 
</p><p>
It is unfortunate that you are thus disabled from comparing 
different accounts, and forced to judge from partial recital, 
The best remaining resource is to contrast the ministerial and 
opposition prints. Among the persons best informed, it seems 
to be doubtful, whether the Allies will push on towards the city, 
or wear away the national resources by warring on the frontiers. The former would have consisted better with a determination to restore the monarchy, and the latter seems to indicate a projected dismemberment. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, the expense of blood and treasure to this 
country is inconceivable. Already artisans and laborers of every kind are extremely rare. The price of mechanics is risen 
to twelve livres, that of common hands to five livres, and this, 
notwithstanding the regulation of subsistence to something very near the ancient standard. Manufactures are becoming 
very dear, and the attempt to limit prices, though enforced by 
the dreadful guillotine, cannot but produce the reverse of what 
it is intended for. 
</p><p>
The ensuing winter, unless some important changes take place, 
must be productive of scenes most melancholy and distress 
ing. If the enemy possesses himself of the strong holds along 
the northern frontier, he will undoubtedly ravage Picardy with 
his immense cavalry during the winter season, and thus destroy 
one great granary. The resources of Barbary, Sicily, and 
Italy are already cut oft from the south. The Vendee is in 
train to become a desert. The army of the Republic lays it 
waste with fire and sword. I will not endeavor to paint the 
various wretchedness, which has been described to me as existing in that quarter. If the war continue another year, the 
wishes of those who meditate the ruin of France will be so far 
accomplished, that many years of peace will not be able to re 
store her wealth and population. This will, I think, be a misfortune to the United States, and in all possible events the 
present turmoil of Europe will furnish terrible examples to the 
present age, and to a distant posterity. I am ; &c.

P. S. I have paid four hundred and forty livres for packing up the statue of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker'>General Washington</a>. Is this to be charged to the United States ? Or will you receive it for me from 
the State of Virginia ?
