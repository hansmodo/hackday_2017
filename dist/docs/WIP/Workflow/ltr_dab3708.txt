Dear General, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 28th ultimo, 
and am thankful for the contents. I have acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 29th of December, and shall give every encouragement to General Clark's intended enterprise. I wish he may be 
in readiness before the waters fail, and the Kentucky 
settlements are destroyed by the enemy. But I am 
informed that little or nothing hath as yet been done 
at his boat-yards, and that the militia he expected 
from this side of the mountain are availing themselves of the unsettled jurisdiction. 
</p><p>
Since my last, a small paper was brought to me 
by some faithful Indians, who found it rolled up very 
neatly in a powder-horn, which a disaffected person 
had lost near the waters of the Sandusky. I take 
the liberty to inclose a copy of it. I have discovered the writer, and put him in irons; but as, too probably, some of the garrison are concerned, he may 
escape before he meets the reward of his demerit. 
Indeed, this place is infested with such a set of disaffected inhabitants, that I have been under the necessity of ordering some away, and others must soon 
follow, to prevent greater injury to the service.

A number of Delaware Indians, from Coochocking, 
have been here since my last, and appear to be as 
friendly as ever. I am persuaded that a few are 
well affected ; but they are now put to the trial, by 
being ordered to remove hither without loss of time, 
and remain under our protection, where their daily 
transactions will be seen and known. 
</p><p>
I have called upon the county Lieutenants for a 
few of the militia ; and if I am not disappointed as 
usual, I intend to surprise the Indian towns about 
Coochocking. Two Delaware Indians, who, in their 
cups, spoke contemptuously of our service, I have 
confined in irons ; but I am at a loss what farther to 
do with them, until I see what number joins us, and 
hear what their general conduct has been. Immediately after the termination of the intended excursion, 
I will avail myself of your indulgence to represent 
the state of things in this district. I have the honor 
to be, with the most perfect respect and esteem, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. By the arrangement, it appears that Captain Brady is arranged in the third Pennsylvania regiment ; but, as he cannot be more useful than he is 
in this part of the country, I hope he will be permitted to remain until the campaign is closed.
