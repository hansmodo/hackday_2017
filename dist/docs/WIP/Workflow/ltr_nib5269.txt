My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . Here am I, who have taken a fancy to this Bank &amp; having built it up with infinite care am striving to keep it I 
from being destroyed to the infinite wrong as I most sincerely &amp; conscientiously believe of the whole country. To me all other considerations are insignificant I mean to stand by 
it &amp; defend it with all the small faculties which <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
has assigned to me. I care for no party in politics or religion 
have no sympathy with <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Mr Jackson</a> or <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a> or <a href='/results.php?tla=wiw' rel='colleague'>Mr Wirt</a> or <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel='colleague'>Mr Calhoun</a> or Mr Ellmaker or <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr Van Buren</a>. 
I am for the Bank &amp; the Bank alone. Well then, here comes <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Mr Jackson</a> who takes it into his head to declare that the Bank 
had failed &amp; that it ought to be superceded by some ricketty machinery of his own contrivance. <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Mr Jackson</a> being the 
President of the U.S. whose situation might make his ignorance mischeivous, we set to work to disenchant the country of their foolery &amp; we have so well succeeded that I will venture to say that there is no man, no woman, &amp; no child in U.S. who does not understand that the worthy President was in a great error. . .

It remains to see how its evil consequences may be averted. 
It seems to me there is no one course by which his friends may 
extricate him not merely safely but triumphantly. He has 
made the Bank a Power. He has made the Bank a deciding 
question as to his own selection. Now let him turn this power 
to his own advantage. As yet the Bank is entirely uncommitted the Bank is neither for him nor against him. In 
this state let his friends come forward boldly, &amp; taking the 
Bank out of the hands of their enemies, conciliate back the 
honest friends whom their rashness has alienated, and who 
think that the only difficulty which he has yet to overcome 
is the dread of their internal convulsion to which the prostration of the Bank will lead. The most extraordinary part 
of the whole matter is that the President &amp; the Bank do not 
disagree in the least about the modifications he desires. He 
wishes some changes The Bank agrees to them and yet 
from some punctilio which is positively purile his rash friends 
wish him to postpone it. Do they not perceive that his enemies are most anxious to place him in opposition to the Bank ? 
And should not every motive of prudence induce him to disappoint their calculations ? The true &amp; obvious theory seems 
to me to disarm the antagonists of their strongest weapon 
to assume credit for settling this question for the administration. If the present measure fails, it carries bitterness into 
the ranks of the best part of the opposition. If it succeeds without the administration it displays their weakness. If the 
bill passes &amp; the President negatives it, I will not say that it will destroy him but I certainly think it will &amp; moreover 
I think it ought to. I can imagine no question which seems 
more exclusively for the representatives of the people than 
the manner in which they choose to keep &amp; to manage the 
money of the people. 
</p><p>
... I suppose the President has been made to believe that 
the Bank is busy in hostility to him you know how wholly 
unfounded this is. For myself I do not care a straw for him 
or his rivals I covet neither his man servant nor even 
his maid servant, his ox nor any of his asses. Long may he live 
to enjoy all possible blessings, but if he means to wage war 
upon the Bank if he pursues us till we turn &amp; stand at 
bay, why then he may perhaps awaken a spirit which has 
hitherto been checked &amp; reined in and which it is wisest--^ 
not to force into offensive defence.

Ponder over these things and believe me
