Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The receipt of your favor of the seventh, last night, gave 
me great pleasure. I am happy for the sake of America, that 
your sentiments so perfectly coincided with my own. The 
commander in chief of the northern department may, if he 
pleases, neglect to ask, or disdain to receive advice, but those 
who know him will, I am sure, be convinced that he wants it. 
Fortune may make him a great man, in the estimation of the 
vulgar, who will fix their estimation at their own price, let the 
intrinsic value be what it will, but it is not in the power of fortune to bestow those talents, which are necessary to render a 
person superior to her malice. This being the case, it is but 
equal, that, between competitors, she should take the weaker 
side to preserve the natural equality of mankind. 
</p><p>
I am confident that the proper advantages will not be taken of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne's</a> situation. We have no chance, I fear, in that 
quarter from management. The only resource, therefore, will be a hattle, and I doubt our skill to manage that. At any 
rate, the season closes fast, and if <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a> cannot get to Albany, he must at least retire to Ticonderoga. I learn that 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates's</a> army is eleven, and <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>Lincoln's</a> five thousand. Tant mieux sed quare de hoc. I am also told that the Indians are 
determined to take up the hatchet for us. If this be true, it would be infinitely better to wear away the enemy's army, by 
a scrupulous and polite attention, than to violate the rules of decorum and the laws of hospitality, by making an attack upon strangers in our own country. 
</p><p>
From Peekskill we have intelligence, that the enemy 
have marched into New Jersey with five thousand men, and 
from their motions seem determined to attempt the western 
pass of the mountains. Either their numbers are exaggerated 
greatly, or they mean some capital diversion. I rather think 
the former, and that their object is merely to return the compliment, which Sullivan paid them on Staten Island. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker'>General Washington</a>, as you will have heard before this 
reaches you, has had a severe conflict with Howe. He was 
obliged to retire. Our loss is far from inconsiderable. Howe, 
I imagine, will get Philadelphia. This will be determined at 
Swede's Ford on the Schuykill. If we can beat him, he 
will be, if not mined, yet as near it as any man need be. If 
the contrary happens, we must, to say the best of it, have another winter's campaign. 
</p><p>
The Chief Justice (<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague friend met'>Jay</a>) is gone to fetch his wife. The 
Chancellor (Livingston) is solacing himself with his wife, his 
farm, and his imagination. Our Senate is doing, I know not 
what. In Assembly we wrangle long to little purpose. You 
will think so, when I tell you, that from nine in the morning 
till dusk in the evening, we were employed in appointing Scott, 
Pawling, Yates, and Webster to be the council of appointment. 
I tremble for the consequences, but I smile, and shall continue 
to do sc , if possible. We have not appointed delegates, nor 
do I know when or whom we shall appoint. We have some 
principles of fermentation, which must, if it be possible, evaporate before that business is entered upon. We are just about 
to think of a Militia Law, and I should be happy to be informed of your sentiments, or rather plans, upon that subject. It 
is doubtless of importance, and the mode now to be adopted, 
whether good or evil, will have a very distant operation. It 
will become a principal part of the jurisprudence of the State, 
and, as such, shed an influence upon the Constitution. I am 
yours, &c.
