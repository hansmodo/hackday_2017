MY GOOD AND DEAR OLD FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of April 2Qth, wherein you complain of your friends here not writing to you. I had written a 
letter to you on the 2oth of the same month, which I hope is 
long since come to hand ; but I confess I ought to have written 
sooner, to acknowledge the receipt of the box of seeds, whereby 
I was much obliged. As to your pension, there is not, I believe, the least reason for you to apprehend its being stopped. 
I know not who receives it for you here, or I should quicken 
them in writing to you. But there is no instance in this King's 
reign of taking away a pension once granted, unless for some 
great offence. Young is in no esteem here as far as I can learn. 
</p><p>
I wish your daughter success with her silkworms. I am 
persuaded nothing is wanting in our country for the produce 
of silk, but skill; which will be obtained by persevering till 
we are instructed by experience. 
</p><p>
You take notice of the failing of your eyesight. Perhaps 
you have not spectacles that suit you, and it is not easy there 
to provide one's self. People too, when they go to a shop for 
glasses, seldom give themselves time to choose with care; 
and, if their eyes are not rightly suited, they are injured. 
Therefore I send you a complete set, from number one to 
thirteen, that you may try them at your ease; and, having 
pitched on such as suit you best at present, reserve those of 
higher numbers for future use, as your eyes grow still older; 
and with the lower numbers, which are for younger people, 
you may oblige some other friends. My love to good Mrs. 
Bartram and your children. I am, as ever, your faithful 
friend and servant, B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. On inquiry, I find your pension continues, and will 
be regularly paid, as it becomes due, to the person you empower to receive it for you. 
</p>
