SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours of the 10th inst., came safe to hand yesterday. The mode I 
have adopted in taking substitutes is to oblige all under fifty to furnish 
two substitutes, and all above fifty one substitute, which is conforming 
to the militia law as near as can be. All those who have surrendered 
since the time limited by my invitation, I have parolled till the meeting 
of the Legislature, to be dealt with as they think proper; a copy of the 
parole I now enclose you. I am entirely of opinion with you, that a 
body of good cavalry will be indispensably necessary to restore order 
and good government in the different parts of the country, after the 
enemy have quitted Charlestown; for there are a parcel of infamous 
wretches whom the habit of plundering has taken such fast hold of, 
that nothing but a military force will ever be able to subdue them, and 
that force must be cavalry. But, unfortunately for this country, we 
have not the means of procuring men to put such a corps on the respectable establishment, as it ought to be; however, as Maham's corps 
at present sCauds, I flatter myself we shall be able to put it on a very 
respectable footing as soon as we can get into the town. By the determination of the Council, the substitute money is all to be applied to 
raise recruits for the Continental line of this State; therefore, any 
application of it towards recruiting State troops would be improper. 
You mention those who agree to find substitutes give twenty-five 
guineas; they are to procure the substitutes, cost what they will ; at the 
same time great caution should be used that they do not go beyond 
thirty guineas, otherwise, it would ruin our recruiting service. I, there 
fore, think the best way would be for them to pay the money into your 
hands, and you to recruit the men, by which means you will be able to 
prevent the service being injured by exorbitant bounties. I think the 
State's share of seizures, that are made under my proclamation of the 
14th of March last, cannot better be applied than to the purpose you 
mention that is, recruiting Maham's corps, and which I very much 
approve of; but, I could wish you to reserve as much out of the first 
sales as will pay Harris for the wagon you purchased of him, for I can 
with truth assure you, that 1 have no present means, or a prospect of 
any, until we get into Charlestown, of satisfying this or any other 
demand against the State, as the Council have declined their assent to 
selling any more negroes until the enemy quit the State. I am glad to 
find, by the surrender of the party you mention, that the Northern 
parts of the State are now clear of the disaffected. I don t apprehend 
any danger now from Fanning. Our printer has began to publish his 
paper again, and I enclose you one of them.

I am, sir, your obedient humble servant,
