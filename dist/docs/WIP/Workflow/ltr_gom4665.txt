Sir, 
</p><p>
The United States of America, faithful to their friendship for 
the French nation, in compliance with the request made them 
by M. Ternant, have engaged in the assistance of St Domingo, in consequence of the decree passed by the National 
Assembly ; and the payment of the four millions, which occasioned that decree, has been completed. In consequence of 
this same friendship, and in conformity to another request of 
M. Ternant, the necessary arrangements have been made for 
placing at the disposal of this Minister a sum of three mil 
lions, which is to be appropriated to the purchase of provisions 
for France.

The government of the United States, in communicating to 
me the measures which I have the honor to lay before you, 
has informed me, that the administration of the Colony of St 
Domingo had purchased several cargoes, sent to that island by 
American merchants, that it had seized others, and that in 
payment of the whole it had given drafts on the representative 
of the French nation at Philadelphia, who, for want of funds, 
has been unable to honor them. No one suspects that France 
will fail to discharge at last a debt so sacred ; but in a case 
of this kind, delays are very prejudicial to the persons concern 
ed. Consequently, Sir, I have received orders to solicit from 
the French Republic instructions to her Minister in Philadelphia to answer these drafts, by appropriating to this purpose a 
part of the funds to be paid to him by the Treasury of the 
United States. I have the honor to be,
