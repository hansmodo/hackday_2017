I received your favor by Dr. One, and read it with much 
satisfaction. Your sentiments and mine respecting public 
affairs do not differ. I am still of opinion that a pacification 
upon honorable terms is practicable. This opinion I declared in the council of war at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> last Thursday : 
urging strenuously a forbearance of hostilities, and praying 
that we might act only on the defensive ; at least till the 
other Colonies were consulted. Some declared themselves 
of the same opinion. Others thought that now was the time 
to strike, and cut off the troops before they were reenforced ; 
and then, said they, the day will be our own. As if Great 
Britain could not replace three thousand men, nor land at 
any other place than <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ! By the way, I do not see what 
mighty advantage can accrue to us by getting possession of 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; none, I am sure, which can countervail the loss of 
thousands in storming the town, which will immediately be 
beat to pieces by the men-of-war. I had twenty to one 
rather make an attempt upon the Castle. Notwithstanding the 
warmth of some men, by all I can now learn, the only capital manoeuvre at present will be the enlisting an army, and 
getting it disciplined, ready to oppose any violence which 
shall be offered by those who are inimical to us. And this 
plan I do not find that any one objects against : on the contrary, those judicious, moderate men who have hitherto 
opposed the measure, now think it necessary, and that the 
late expedition of the troops will justify us therein. The 
number agreed on by our Congress as their quota of thirty 
thousand, to be raised in New England, is thirteen thousand 
six hundred men, whom they have already begun to enlist. 
In consequence of this plan, I am persuaded that no immediate attack is intended, either upon <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> or the Castle. 
But, if what is reported to-day be true, I cannot pretend to 
say what the deceitful baseness of Gage and the indignation 
of our countrymen may produce. We are told that he 
assured the inhabitants of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, if they would deliver up 
their arms, he would permit the inhabitants to leave the 
town ; that they have complied with the condition ; and 
that now he refuses to let the people go. But all this 
wants confirmation.

Josiah <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, Jr., Esq., is arrived at Gloucester, and 
the Selectmen of that town, in a letter I received this morn 
ing, say he is very ill, and near expiring. Lyde, with 
whom he came, sailed a good while before Callahan, who 
got in some time ago. 
</p><p>
I was this day informed by one of the Derby's, who 
spent the last evening with Callahan, that he, though inclined to Toryism (as the term is), confessed it was in 
vain to deny the distress already arising to Great Britain by 
means of the non-importation. Many of the discharged 
manufacturers have taken to the highways, armed, and the 
jails are filled with them already. 
The harbor of Marblehead is blocked up by a man-of-war ;  ours is yet free.

P. S. I hope nothing will prevent your communicating to me your plan of a pacification very soon.
