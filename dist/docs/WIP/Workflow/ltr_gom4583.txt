Dear Hamilton, 
</p><p>
I did expect that in congratulating you, which I do most 
sincerely, upon your appointment, I should have communicated a matter which would have administered much ease and 
convenience to the affairs of your department. I learn this 
morning that these expectations are frustrated from a quarter, 
and in a manner, which would excite my surprise, had I not 
long since acquired the habit of wondering at nothing. I will 
tell you a plain story. 
</p><p>
M. Necker, pressed for money, had listened to overtures 
for selling the debt of the United States, and mentioned the 
matter to some members of the National Assembly, by which 
means it became known to the principal Americans, and 
friends of America here. I own that upon the first mention 
of the matter, it appeared to me a thing of indifference, and 
so I expressed myself. Our duty is to pay to such creditors 
as may possess the demand. But further information placed 
the affair in a different point of light. It appeared that the 
offer was for a small part, at a great discount ; and that the 
terms of the bargain were to be debated in the National 
Assembly, and consequently our reputation sported with. 
Mr Short did everything in his power, but having no pointed 
instructions, could only express the result of his own judgment and feelings. But the minister was pressed for money, 
and he had the offer of money. Under these circumstances, 
in connexion with a society of friends to America, I made M. Necker an offer, such as in my conception was honorable to 
France, to America, and to the parties. This proposition, 
(after stating the amount of the principal and interest which 
would be due on the first of January <a href='/results.php?year=1790'>1790</a>, and considering 
that as a new capital on which the interest was to run,) contains the following terms. On propose de P acquerir du gouvernementj et a cet effet de I 9 - acquitter en entier par des rents perpetuelles de la France moniantes a la meme somme. This 
payment was to be made in the year <a href='/results.php?year=1790'>1790</a> and <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a> ; consequently, so far as France is concerned, the offer went to a 
full, complete, and entire payment, and that at a much earlier 
period than is stipulated by the terms of the loans themselves. 
To this was added a further offer, in case the situation of 
affairs in this kingdom should require it, in the following terms ; 
On se chargera de solder en argent la moitie de la dite rente 
au prix courant des effets royaux. This part of the offer 
has no other merit than to secure to the minister the sale of 
the French effects, if he thought proper, and is therefore a 
matter rather of convenience than advantage. I communicated this plan, beforehand, to Mr Short, and to the Marquis de 
Lafayette, who both considered it as an excellent means of 
saving at the same time the honor and interest of America, 
while it furnished a useful resource to France. I showed it 
also to Monsieur de Montmorin, who, having well weighed 
and considered it, assured me that he most heartily approved 
it, and would do everything in his power to secure the success. 
In the supposition that this plan were adopted here, application was to be made through you to the United States to pay 
the amount of this debt in obligations for current guilders, calculating the exchange at par ; those obligations to bear five per 
cent interest, and to be paid in instalments, the first of which 
to commence five years hence. Consequently, as the society 
was to bear all the charges of negotiation, &c. &c. it follows 
clearly, that the United States would have obtained the needful 
time required for their accommodation without a farthing of expense, and without the pain of soliciting it from this Court. It 
was therefore equally honorable and useful for them. It was 
honorable also to the parties. First, because they became eminently useful to the societies of which they are respectively 
members; and secondly, because the advantage, if any, which 
they were to derive would result merely from a careful and 
industrious attention to the variations of the exchange and fluctuations in the effects, and from the use of their funds and 
credit to make investments at the proper times and seasons, 
which, as far as the sum of forty millions of livres and up 
wards can go, must necessarily have sustained the value of the 
stocks here. And you will observe that this was clearly stated 
and understood. 
</p><p>
The proposition was delivered to M. Necker on the fifth of 
December. You will observe, that in framing it we counted 
upon the aid of money-lenders in Holland ; and, in preference 
to others, upon the commissioners of the United States. We 
learned, however, that these gentlemen had, notwithstanding 
the remonstrances of Mr Jacob Van Staphorst, who has a real 
and warm regard for America, joined with those who made the 
offer to M. Necker. Through the channel that brought us this 
information, an interview was brought about between Monsieur 
de la Chaise and Mr Van Staphorst, charged with the final pro 
position to M. Necker and me. I told those gentlemen, that I 
was convinced their offer could not be accepted, (by the bye, 
M. Necker had told me that the sum offered was not sufficient,) 
and that, if accepted by the minister, it could not be adopted 
by the Assembly, and that they risked doing great injury to 
America, without any advantage to themselves ; that I would 
communicate to them an offer I had made } and which I had 
great reason to believe would be adopted ; that I would offer 
them an interest in it, or a commission, at their option ; that if 
they should not approve of holding a concern, I would then lie 
still, and let them make the most of their plans without opposi 
tion, but asked the assurance on the part of themselves and of 
their principals, (those whom they represented) that if they 
found their own Scheme impracticable, and did not choose to 
adventure with me, they should only not oppose. This 
being solemnly promised, I stated the matter to them at large, 
and they came so fully into my views, as to withhold the pro 
position they were directed to make, and send an express on 
the subject to Amsterdam. 
</p><p>
The interview was on the eleventh of December, in the evening. Some further discussions were needful, which we had the 
next day. I avoided going to M. Necker s, because I was to do 
nothing which would defeat their plan. On the twenty-sixth, 
Mr Hubbard, partner of the house of Staphorst, arrived charged to make their offer, with a budget of reasons in support of 
it. This offer was to purchase the 6,000,000 at a discount of 
about eleven per cent. It was made immediately ; and on 
the morning of the 28th he called on me, in company with 
Mr Van Staphorst. I had heen repeatedly assured from 
different quarters that M. Necker was ready to treat with me, 
but I had not put myself in his way. The conversation with Mr Hubbard was not very long. I heard what he had to say, and 
replied with great precision, but so as to change entirely his 
opinion. You will not wonder at this, when I tell you the 
purport of the objections he had brought forward ; first, that it 
was too profitable to the parties ; secondly, too burdensome to 
France ; and thirdly, might injure the credit of America by 
selling the obligations too low. To the first, I replied by a 
smile, and the assurance, that I never expected such an objection from Holland. This disconcerted him. To the second 
I answered, that M. Necker understood his own business, and 
might safely be trusted in making a bargain ; but I showed 
him further that the bargain was a good one. To the last I 
made the answer, which I am sure you have already made in 
your own mind, viz. that if the commissioners of the United 
States could safely be trusted in making negotiations, where 
the loss was to be borne by their employers, a fortiori might 
they be trusted where the loss was to be borne by them 
selves. 
</p><p>
As all this was merely ostensible, I pressed him hard for the 
real reasons, but could get nothing more than assurances that 
there were no other than those above mentioned. As these 
were clearly refuted, of course he acknowledged himself 
converted ; but Hudibras has very well observed that, 
</p><p>
Who's convinced against his will, 
Is of the same opinion still. 
A more effectual change was wrought by M. Necker, who, 
on the second of this month, refused their offer. On the morning 
of the third, Mr Hubbard called and informed me of this, and 
in the afternoon of the fifth he set off for Amsterdam, apparently 
desirous of bringing all his friends into my views. The business went on but slowly in Amsterdam ; and Mr Jacob Van 
Staphorst was amused from time to time, and amused me with 
the expectation that each succeeding post would bring their 
definitive answer ; but this morning he tells me, with very sincere regret, what has been done. The letter to you on this 
subject I have read, and will make a few remarks upon it, but 
shall not be very precise, perhaps, as it is only from memory 
of what it contained that I write. 
</p><p>
The idea of an enormous profit, admitting for a moment 
that such were to accrue, would hardly have been with them 
what Candid calls the sufficient reason for refusal, although per 
haps it might have been for acceptance. But you can judge 
of the extent of that profit, and you will with me smile at the 
absurdity of connecting with such profit a sacrifice in the price 
of American obligations, on the vending of which at or near 
par, the profit must certainly depend. There is something 
else which perhaps is more ridiculous still, viz. that the United 
States, whose obligations belonging to numerous individuals 
are daily sold on the change of Amsterdam, should apprehend 
an injury to their credit from trusting a farther negotiation to 
persons, whose immediate interest in supporting that credit 
would be so great. They state as a great difficulty the borrowing of twelve millions within the term, when on the same 
pledge they can borrow twenty. Their statement of sums is 
not, I believe, very accurate, or perhaps my memory is not 
accurate. However, I am sure the idea is, that the greater 
sum can be borrowed more easily than the less. There is also 
the farther very extraordinary idea, that it is for the interest 
of the United States to pay between four and five per cent 
upon a negotiation, rather than get it done for nothing. I shall 
not notice many expressions which are injurious, but make to 
their affectation of disinterestedness, the answer which Jacob 
Van Staphorst made to me. It is very strange that they should 
say all this, when they must remember that in M. Calonne's 
time, they offered him only fourteen millions of livers for one 
half of the thirty-two, and arrearages of interest, but would not 
take the whole, even at that rate, which is the reason why the 
bargain was broken off. I should make but a poor excuse for 
so long a story, if I stopped here ; but I will now proceed to 
give you what T conceive to be the key of the riddle. 
</p><p>
These gentlemen are engaged, as I suppose you know, in 
very extensive speculations upon the funded debt of America. 
They have lately worked this matter to a most astonishing benefit. Above three millions of that debt, which cost them five 
shillings in the pound, has been made the basis of a loan on 
which they receive sixty per cent, and are bound to repay it 
by instalments from the interest receivable in America. The 
Dutch, however, prefer lending at five per cent to the Congress direct. It is, therefore, essential to the success of their 
schemes, that they should be able to suspend the one loan al 
ways till they have completed the other ; and thus our nation 
al interests are rendered subservient to their particular negotiations. You will easily see that one such operation, in which there 
is no risk, is better worth pursuing than the very great profit 
they complain of. With this hint you will understand the matter thoroughly. I must come to a conclusion. 
</p><p>
I did not see M. Necker as I expected this afternoon, be 
cause he was gone to council ; however I must suspend, at 
least, the matter with him ; but you may rely on it that if the 
Minister at this court, or any other agent, be authorised fully 
to deal in the business, and, if the court will not readily agree 
to a new arrangement respecting the debt, to contract with individuals, that the matter can be yet managed in the manner 
above mentioned, provided it be not too long delayed. As to 
the loan which the commissioners have undertaken of their own 
heads, you may, I think, derive great advantage from it ; for, 
in the first place, your Minister or Agent can make terms with 
them to that amount at pleasure, for the benefit of the United 
States ; and you may, in the next place, convert the money to 
very useful purpose by sinking three or four times as much of 
the domestic debt, and raising the price at the same time to 
wards par, which will prevent the success of speculations by 
foreigners, which are a loss to America. I am very truly, &c.
