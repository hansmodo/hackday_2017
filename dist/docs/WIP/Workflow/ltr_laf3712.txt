My dear General, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the loth is just come to hand. The 
moment a perfect intelligence can be got, Major Macpherson vill be despatched. But some expressions in 
your last favor vill, if possible, augment my vigilance 
in keeping you well apprised of the enemy's movements. 
</p><p>
There are, in Hampton Road, thirty transport 
ships full of troops, most of them red-coats ; there 
are eight or ten brigs, which have cavalry on board. 
They had excellent winds, and yet they are not 
gone. Some say they have received advices from 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in a row-boat. The escort, as I mentioned 
before, is the Charon, and several frigates; the last 
account says, seven. The light infantry. Queen's 
rangers, and two British regiments, are, I think, on 
board. Two German regiments are, it seems, destined 
to the same service. I cannot be positive, and do 
not even think Lord Cornwallis has been fully determined. I have got in <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> many people that 
watch his motions. But none has been able to slip 
out. His Lordship went to Old Point Comfort, had 
a survey taken of the properest place to build a fort, 
had the soundings examined, and returned to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> with General Leslie. 
</p><p>
This State is so difficult to be defended, that one 
false step involves the one that does not command 
the water, in a series of inconveniences. His Lordship has taken pilots for the Bay and for <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. This, I suppose, is a feint. But a march south 
of James River, throws me out of supporting distance 
for any thing that is north of it; a march to the north gives the enemy command of every thing south of the river. 
</p><p>
Two battalions of light infantry and the militia are 
at this place, the healthiest and best-watered spot in 
the State. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> is at Good's Bridge, on 
the Appomattox, with the Pennsylvanians and Virginia Continentals, and looks toward Roanoke or <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. Muhlenberg, with a battalion of light infantry, some riflemen, and the horse, has an intermediary 
position between me and Suffolk, in the neighbourhood of which moves a party of militia under Colonel 
Parker. General Weedon is in person at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, and, the moment a fleet appears, will call out 
the militia. Gregory is on the other side of the Dismal Swamp. I cannot hear from him, but sent him 
orders by a safe hand to call out the militia, mount 
some cannon on the passes, and take out of the way 
every boat which might serve the enemy to go to 
North Carolina. You know, my dear General, that, 
with a very trifling transportation, they may go by 
water from <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> to Wilmington. The only 
way to shut up that passage is to have an army before <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and posted at the head of these 
rivers ; a movement, which, unless I was certain of 
a naval superiority, might prove ruinous. But, should 
a fleet come into Hampton Road, and should I get 
some days' notice, our situation would be very agreeable. 
</p><p>
I am endeavouring to get a cavalry, and it is not 
without trouble. Transportation is a great objection 
to the formation of magazines. A naval superiority 
would also level that difficulty. It appears a pretty 
large body of troops have been sent to Kemp's Landing ; some cannon removed from <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> ; but nothing that can make his Lordship's intentions perfectly understood. Any certainty of a naval superiority, I 
would wish to know instantly, as then I will give 
his Lordship every opportunity to go up the rivers. 
There is a chain of expresses ; but I shall see that 
it is more properly conducted. With the highest 
esteem and most tender afFection, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Yours, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.
