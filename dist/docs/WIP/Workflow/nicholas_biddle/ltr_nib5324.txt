Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In a letter received this evening from Mr. Leigh of 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, he expressed a wish that his correspondence on 
the subject of Chief Justice Marshall which you will find in the <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> Whig should be republished in the American. 
You will I am sure gladly contribute to vindicate the reputation of such a man from assailants who avenge themselves for 
his superiority while living by calumniating his memory. In doing this you will gratify Mr Leigh &amp; oblige 
</p>
