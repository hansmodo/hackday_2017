My dear sir 
</p><p>
. . . The gamblers are doing every thing in their power 
to bend Mr. Duane to their purposes. But he knows them and 
will not yield an inch. I feel entirely confident that he will do 
his duty, and will leave his place rather than prostitute it.

I wish to wait a little while until the smoke blows off, before doing any thing very decisive. In the mean time I wish 
you would keep within your income and bring the State Banks in debt to you: and for the present it is better that you 
should do it than that I should say it: for when once we begin, we shall have many things to do, which will crush the 
Kitchen Cabinet at once
