My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have always thought that the best thing which <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr Van Buren</a> could do in reference to himself personally, as well 
as to his political party, would be to make peace with the 
Bank and the present state of things furnishes an admirable opportunity of accomplishing that object. Why indeed 
should he not? To all the members of the Cabinet except 
one, 1 I personally have always stood in a friendly relation, 
and in regard to the President himself there is no sort of 
personal difference. The way therefore would be open for 
a general amnesty which for the sake of the country I 
am willing to consent to and I do believe that just now 
the effect would be electric &amp; decisive.
