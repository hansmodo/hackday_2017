Dear Sir 
</p><p>
A friend of mine and Mr Duane's asked me two days 
ago if there was any body in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to whom I could 
recommend Mr. Duane, so that he might not be deceived and 
see things with his own eyes. I said that you were the very- 
man. I have had no opportunity of seeing my friend since, to 
ascertain whether he had mentioned your name to Mr. Duane. 
Whether he did or did not however, you have the means of 
doing much good by frank communications with Mr. D. He 
I believe knows and feels that the toils of these gamblers are 
spread for him, and he ought to be helped in his honest efforts 
to disentangle himself. If these practices could once be brought 
home to a gang so as to satisfy the President and Secretary 
of their schemes, the country might be much benefitted
