Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
... I wish Mr. arbour had introduced his motion at 
some other time for just now it is particularly inconvenient. 
I need not tell the Chairman of the Com. of Commerce that 
for the last four or five months the course of trade and ex 
change has carried off a great part of the specie fund of the 
country &amp; that the Banks may probably be obliged to defend 
themselves by diminishing their accomodations to the Community which is you know the ultimate remedy. But it is sometimes a severe one. We have been striving to avoid it 
by very large sales of bills which yet do not supply the demand. Just at this moment it happened very luckily that the 
quotations of the Bank Stock in England were such as to show 
that remittance of it would be as good as specie calculating 
the present rate of exchange &amp; the price of 5.10 in London. 
Accordingly large remittance of Stocks were contemplated 
the effect of which would have been, besides the profit to our 
citizens to furnish an amount of exchange which would relieve by so much the pressure on the Banks by specie. I think 
that a million of dollars would have taken that direction in a 
week or two &amp; would have afforded real relief. The proposal 
to sell 7 millions of course destroys all chance of a sale in England at present prices. Nor is this all. For if the foreign Stock 
holders should take the alarm &amp; throw their stock into the market here it would create a new demand for exchange to 
remit the proceeds, &amp; thus increase the pressure on the Banks. Whatever be the decision of Congress it is desirable that it should be soon made.
