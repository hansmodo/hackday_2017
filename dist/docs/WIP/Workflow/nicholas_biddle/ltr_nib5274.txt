My dear General, 
</p><p>
For the last week I have been expecting daily to return home, &amp; was willing therefore to spare you &amp; myself the 
trouble of corresponding, when we could so much more readily converse about the matter. It has been a week of hard 
work anxiety &amp; alternating hopes &amp; fears, but I think that we may now rely with confidence in a favorable result. You 
know how many difficulties are to be overcome how many 
hostilities are to be encountered; how many friendly indiscretions and weaknesses are to be repaired, in a work like this. 
I think moreover that it has reached a point where we may promise ourselves some rest. The Senate are now occupied 
with what I consider the most decisive point of the whole question and being obliged to leave the capitol to prepare 
for some company to dine with me, I write these views as preliminary to the news which the Senators who are to be my 
guests may bring with them. They have come. This day like yesterday has been consumed in rejecting a very distract 
ing &amp; dangerous proposal to exchange a bonus for the obligation to discount at five per cent. I have been at work all 
day to get rid of it and we have succeeded by a vote of 26 to 1 8 in excluding it. Tomorrow we shall have something decisive.
