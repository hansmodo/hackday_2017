My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will hear, I am afraid with regret, tho not with surprize, that we have determined on applying to the present 
Congress for a renewal of the Charter of the Bank &amp; that a memorial for that purpose will be forwarded tomorrow or the 
next day. To this course I have made up my mind after great reflection &amp; with the clearest convictions of its propriety. The 
reasons I will briefly explain. I. The Stockholders have devolved upon the Directors the discretion of choosing the time 
of making the application. If we should omit a favorable opportunity we would commit an irreparable error, &amp; would be 
permanently reproached with it by the Stockholders. Now these Stockholders are entirely unanimous in their opinions 
and in a case of such grave responsibility their wishes are entitled to great consideration. Unless therefore there should 
be some very strong reason against it, the application should be made. 2. Independent however of this, I believe That this 
is the proper time. The Charter will expire in March <a href='/results.php?year=1836'>1836</a> 
Unless the present Congress acts upon it, we must wait till 
the Congress of December <a href='/results.php?year=1833'>1833</a>, &amp; could not expect from 
them any decision before after March <a href='/results.php?year=1834'>1834</a> which would bring 
the Bank within two years or 18 months of the expiration of its charter. Now whether the institution is to be continued 
or destroyed that time is too short. Until the question is settled every thing will be uncertain. No man can look ahead 
in either public or private affairs as to the state of the currency &amp; there will be constant anxiety about our whole monied 
system. The Bank too ought to know its fate so as to close its affairs without inflicting deep &amp; dangerous wounds upon 
the community by sudden shocks &amp; changes. I believe therefore that this is the best time for settling the question. If the 
Bank is to be continued the country ought to know it soon. If the Bank is to be destroyed the Bank &amp; the country ought both to know it soon. 
</p><p>
The only objection I have heard to it, is, as far as I understand, this : that in about a year hence there is to be an election for a President of the U.S. and if the application is 
now made, the gentleman who is now President will take it amiss &amp; negative the bill while if the Bank will refrain from 
applying until after his election is secured, he will probably 
be permitted to abstain from negativing it. This seems to embrace the whole case Let us look at it. In the first place 
then, neither I nor any of my associates have any thing what ever to do with the President or his election. I know nothing 
about it &amp; care nothing about it. The Bank has never had any concern in elections it will not have any now. To abstain 
from anything which it would otherwise do, on account of an election, is just as bad as doing anything on account of an 
election. Both are equal violations of its neutrality. There are 
many politicians who want to bring it on because it would benefit their side. There are many other politicians who 
want to put it off because that would benefit their side. Hitherto they have been urged to bring it before the last 
Congress in hopes that it would injure the present incumbent now they are urged to postpone it because postponement 
would benefit him. The Bank cares not whether he is benefited or injured. It takes its own time &amp; its own way. 
</p><p>
In the next place what appears to me I confess wholly in 
explicable is why the friends of the present incumbent who 
are also friends of the Bank, if they think the Bank question 
likely to injure the President, do not at once take the question 
out of the hands of their adversaries. If the President's 
friends were to come forward &amp; settle the Bank question 
before the election comes on, they would disarm their antagonists of their most powerful weapon. I am very ignorant of party tactics, &amp; am probably too much biased to be a fit 
judge in this case, but such a course has always seemed to me so obvious that I have never been able to comprehend why it was not adopted. 
</p><p>
But again what is the reason for supposing that the present 
incumbent will be offended by bringing it forward now? What 
possible right has he to be offended ? What too has he meant 
by all these annual messages declaring in <a href='/results.php?year=1829'>1829</a> that he 
could not "too soon present it" to Congress repeating the 
same thing in <a href='/results.php?year=1830'>1830</a> and reiterating it in <a href='/results.php?year=1831'>1831</a>. Was this all 
a mere pretence? that the moment the Bank accepts his own 
invitation he is to be offended by being taken at his word. 
</p><p>
But moreover he is to negative the bill. That is to say, he 
will agree to the bill hereafter, but because he thinks it will 
interfere with his election he will negative it now. Truly this 
is a compliment which I trust he does not deserve from his 
friends, for even I who do not feel the slightest interest in him 
would be sorry to ascribe to a President of the United States 
a course much fitter for a humble demagogue than the Chief 
Magistrate of a great country. He will sign a bill, which of 
course he must think a good one, when his election is over 
but he will not sign this bill, which he thinks a good one, if 
it is likely to take votes from him at an election. And after all, 
what security is there that when his election is over, he will 
not negative the bill ? I see none. On the contrary I am satisfied 
that he would be ten times more disposed to negative it then 
than now. Now he has at least some check in public opinion 
some in the counsels of those around him then he will 
have neither. And now, my dear Sir, I have tired myself as 
I have certainly you with these opinions which you think very 
erroneous &amp; very disrespectful perhaps to the President. But I wanted to explain precisely the course of thinking which has 
brought me to my present conclusion. The only regret which 
accompanies it is that it has not the concurrence of Mr M c Lane &amp; yourself to whom the Bank as well as myself personally owe much for the manner in which you have both 
sustained the institution. I cannot express to you how much 
I am concerned at not being able to adopt the suggestions of Mr McLane who has behaved so handsomely in this matter. 
But we must each in our respective spheres of duty follow our own convictions with mutual regret but still with mutual respect. 
</p><p>
To you I always looked forward as a friend &amp; advocate of 
the Bank whenever the question of its renewal was agitated. 
I shall be very sorry on many accounts that from a difference 
of opinion in regard to time you will be constrained to with 
hold your aid but I assure you it will abate none of the 
regard for you &amp; the fullness of these explanations will I 
hope satisfy you of my anxiety to State to you frankly &amp; 
distinctly the motives which lead me to a conclusion, differing 
I believe for the first time from Your's on the Subject of 
the Bank.
