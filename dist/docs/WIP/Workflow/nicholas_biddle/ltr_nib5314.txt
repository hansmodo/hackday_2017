My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
... I have made up my mind to two things which\ 
I give to you as elements in your calculations I st That it 
is not our interest to prop people who must fall and there 
fore I shall not be inclined to advance a dollar further for / 
any body unless under very peculiar circumstances, and 2. / 
That the Treasury Circular will not be immediately repealed. 
Such at least is the present intension of the Chief who is al 
ready discovered to be weak &amp; vacillating. How this will affect 
your money market you can best judge . . .
