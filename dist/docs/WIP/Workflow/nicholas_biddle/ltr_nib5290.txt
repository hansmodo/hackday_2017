My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . This I know is their design. This very day, a gentleman in whom I have the utmost confidence, repeated to 
me a conversation which a friend of his had with Mr. Woodbury. In the course of it, the latter said, "We are not against 
a bank, but against the Bank" "We went (this was his precise expression) to scrabble for the Stock and to have the 
Offices." "But," said the other, "what will you do with the constitutional question?" "Poh," said Woodbury, "that we 
can use to "suit ourselves." And this is what they all intend. I do not believe that a single member of the Cabinet 
has any constitutional doubts about the matter except Mr. Duane and he, I incline to think, is almost, if not quite as 
firm, in his dislike to State Banks. He is entirely and cordially against the movement of Kendall &amp; I cannot doubt he will 
resist the gamblers. . . .
