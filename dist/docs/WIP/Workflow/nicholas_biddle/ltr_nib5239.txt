Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . The best feelings are entertained toward the bank 
by those whose opinions are most valuable and most useful. 
I am very desirous of making &amp; for that purpose, am particularly solicitious to avoid giving, at the present moment, 
any occasion for the revival of a jealousy which has been recently and deeply felt, in regard to the apparent exclusion or 
omission from the Local Boards of persons favorable to the 
present administration. My stay in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> was too short 
to allow me to consult with you on the subject, but <a href='/results.php?tla=roc' rel='colleague friend'>Mr. Colt</a> 
mentioned the names of five gentlemen who were to be 
nominated and all of whom, it appeared, were in opposition 
to the present administration so that out of the whole 13, 
there are only two gentlemen who are in political harmony 
with the administration. You know, my dear Sir, how entirely indifferent I am to what are called politics &amp; how unwilling I am to introduce things of that kind into the affairs of the Bank. At the same time, it is proper in itself, as 
well as highly expedient, not to give unnecessary offence &amp; not to do anything which might have the appearance 
of partiality. I am afraid that this great disproportion, tho 
entirely accidental, may be the ground of objection &amp; reproach. . . .
