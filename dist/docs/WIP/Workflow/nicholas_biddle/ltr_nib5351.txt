My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The impression which I have that the coming administration will be in fact your administration : one which I can 
honorably support &amp; be connected with has revived a project in which I have for some time indulged but which I have 
never mentioned to any one even of my own family. You will therefore receive it in the same confidence in which it is written. 
I have retired as you know from all active affairs : 2 I do not wish to return to them. Whatever share I may have had 
in the war now happily ended by the elevation of my friends, I have no pretensions and shall stand in no man's 
way. It is a great wish of my family to travel in Europe, and I should incline to indulge it. But as you know travelling in 
Europe to a mere private gentleman is a dull business. If a man had a high public station &amp; a higher public fame, as you 
had, he gets along well, but a private gentleman delivering cold letters of introduction &amp; making his way into what is 
called society has a task extremely repugnant to his pride. 
I am too old for that &amp; I am satisfied that the only way of 
being comfortable is to have some public character which 
at once settles your rank &amp; places you above the necessity 
of groping your way. Of these stations some are troublesome 
from the business to be done &amp; from the crowds of country 
men with whom one comes into contact : others give less rank 
but less labor. Now my object being to travel I would not be 
willing to remain in London or Paris or Petersburgh but I 
would prefer some position within striking distance of all the 
places on the continent, which would form the circle of 
travel and on the whole the place which seems best adapted 
for that purpose is Vienna. In regard to fitness, I have nothing to say I began my career as Secretary in Paris &amp; after 
wards in London. I was to have been sent by Mr Madison as Minister to London at the close of the last war, &amp; was not 
sent because I was not a member of Congress the Far I have never made any suggestion about it, I did not know 
even of the design till some years afterwards, &amp; as I should be "able" &amp; able from my own private means to do all the 
external honors of a legation &amp; have already been at Vienna. I think I might be not a very bad successor * to the recent incumbent. That place too happens to be vacant so that 
no one need be removed and it is moreover ought of the sphere of ordinary competition among political men. The 
great interest to be encouraged there is the introduction upon better terms of our own tobacco and this I think I could manage better, perhaps than any mere planter who would carry about him the odour of his "business in this state." 
</p><p>
And now my story is told. I wish to travel &amp; deeming some public character essential I have thought of one which might 
enable me to do some good, &amp; to represent not unworthily the new administration &amp; the new Secretary for foreign affairs 
both of which I suspect have been misrepresented in more sense than one abroad. To my objects position not salary is 
what I desire not so much a place as a passport. Now tell me what you think of all this? Is it a reasonable thing? Is it a probable thing?
