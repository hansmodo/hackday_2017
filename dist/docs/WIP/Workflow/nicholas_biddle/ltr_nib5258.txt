MEMORANDUM 1 BY BIDDLE 
</p><p>
<a rel="month origin" value="10">Oct'r</a> . <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1831' rel="origin">1831</a>. 
</p><p>
About ten o clock today Mr. M c Lane, Sec'y of the Treas'y called to see me at the Bank. He had come to Phil'a  principally for the purpose of conversing with me after he had seen the President. 
</p><p>
He now stated that he had seen the President, and explained 
to him the course which he proposed to pursue in regard to the 
Bank. He had done this in order that there might be no mis 
apprehension on the part of the Pres. of his views &amp; the con 
sequences which might result from what he proposed to say 
in his report. 
</p><p>
He said to the President that he thought the act of Congress which directed the Secretary of the Treasury to report 
annually to Congress made it the duty of that officer to present his own views &amp; on his own responsibility and that the 
Executive stood rather in the light of a mediator between him (the Sec'y ) &amp; the Legislature. That such had always been 
the construction of the powers of the Secretaries. (This was obviously an infusion by Mr Dickins to whom I left a volume 
with all the passages marked which I thought might encourage this opinion.) He proceeded to explain to the Pres. what 
his intentions were. He means to speak of the power of the Gov to pay off the whole of the debt on the 3 d of March <a href='/results.php?year=1833'>1833</a> 
with the aid of the Bank stock; that this stock if sold out 
would occasion alarm in the country &amp; the panic would sink 
its value; whereas he was satisfied that the Bank would take 
it at a reasonable price, not less certainly than eight millions. 
This would give him an opportunity of speaking of the Bank 
in the most favorable manner, recommending the continuance 
of the charter of the present Bank in preference to a new one, 
with such modifications as without injuring the institution 
might be useful to the country &amp; acceptable to the Executive. 
This he meant to present in the strongest manner he could 
to Congress. All this he explained particularly to the President who made no objection whatever. For greater precision 
he had put down the heads of what he meant to say in his report &amp; showed them to the President. Mr Livingston by 
request of Mr. McLane was present at this meeting. 
</p><p>
It had been previously understood between Mr Livingston 
&amp; Mr McLane that the Pres. should say nothing in the 
message about the Bank. The President acquiesced tho reluctantly in this, because he thought he could not well be silent with consistentcy. But in my (N B s) conversations with 
him Mr. McLane I had expressed the opinion that his silence 
would not be so useful as his mentioning the subject. The 
matter was therefore renewed with Mess" Livingston &amp; McLane &amp; the Pres. and it was resolved that he should introduce the subject in this way that having on former occasions brought the question before the Congress it was now left with the representatives of the people. 
</p><p>
Mr McLane with a view to show the Pres. the full extent to which his report might lead, said that perhaps when his 
report was presented &amp; referred to the Comm 66 of Ways &amp; 
130 Correspondence of Nicholas Riddle 
</p><p>
Means <a href='/results.php?tla=gmd' rel='colleague'>Mr. McDuffie</a> in his present mode of thinking in regard 
to the Bank might choose to introduce a bill into Congress for 
continuing the Charter &amp; if so he (M r M c Lane) could not with 
the views which he entertained of the Bank make any opposition to it. The President said he would be sorry if the question were forced upon him in that way. 
</p><p>
I said it would be necessary to scan very accurately the Pres't J's speech so that there might not be a shade of opinion 
expressed against it, or any declaration that having once ex 
pressed his views &amp; having no reason to change them he would 
now leave it to Congress &amp;c. Mr. McLane said certainly no 
such expression could or should be introduced, as it would not 
be in harmony or consistency with his own (M r M s) report. 
</p><p>
Mr McLane said that he would be willing to charter the 
Bank without any bonus, but intimated that he thought a 
large bonus would be required, &amp; said that this should be 
considered in our proposed purchase of Bank stock. 
</p><p>
He said that he thought the greatest danger of the Bank 
was from those who wished to pull down this Bank in order 
to build up another, that a Mr West of Salem had been very 
pressing on that point. I said there were I believed some capitalists in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> &amp; <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> who were anxious about it, 
but I thought they had little political weight. He said that 
the argument was that to continue it would be a monopoly. 
</p><p>
In regard to the period of applying for a renewal, he does not wish to be considered as the adviser of the Bank because 
it might be imputed to him that he was acting in concert with the institution, but he renewed the opinion which he 
expressed at Washington that it was doubtful (indeed he seemed to be more inclined now to think it inexpedient) 
whether it would be expedient to apply this year. His idea was that if it were put to the President as a test, he would 
be more disposed to reject it on that very account. The Pres 1 
is now perfectly confident of his election the only question is the greater or the less majority, but he is sure of success &amp; wishes to succeed by a greater vote than at the first 
election. If therefore while he is so confident of reelection this question is put to him as one affecting his reelection, he 
might on that account be disposed to put his veto on it, if he be as it were dared to do it. For what I see, says Mr McLane of the character of <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>, I think he would 
be more disposed to yield when he is strong than when he is in danger. 
</p><p>
The footing then on which the matter stands is this : 
</p><p>
The President is to say that having previously brought 
the subject to Congress, he now leaves it with them. 
</p><p>
The Secretary is to recommend the renewal. 
</p><p>
This latter point pleases me much. When I saw him at 
Washington he did not think he could go so far as to originate a recomendation of the Bank, &amp; I therefore examined 
all the reports of all the Secretaries to show that the proposals for the Bank all originated with them &amp; I left the volumes of these reports in Mr Dickin's hands marked, so that he might urge them on the Secretary's attention. 
</p><p>
He thinks he can present the Tariff question strongly he 
will then press with equal strength the Bank question &amp; if he 
can arrange the question of the public lands (the surrender to 
them of the lands within their limits at a certain price so as 
to make the landholding states pay in stock to the old States 
the proportion which the latter have a right to) the Bank 
would be put in such company &amp; on such a footing that even 
Mr Benton would not attack it. 
</p><p>
On his way to Mr Carroll's with the Pres*. the latter adverted to the inconsistency of those who pulled down the old 
Bank &amp; built up the new &amp; particularly of the objection 
then made that foreigners were stockholders. This he considered an unfounded objection. (He mentioned this to me at Washington.) 
</p><p>
Some surprize was felt by the Pres of the Bank at perceiving in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury the following phrases: 
</p><p>
"It is not perceived that there is any sufficient justification in the grounds of the transaction as assumed by the 
"Bank for an arrangement in any form, by which so large 
" an amount of the public funds should be retained by the 
"Bank at the risk of the Gov't  after it had directed their 
"application to the payment of the public creditor." 
</p><p>
The reason of the surprize was this. On the 14 th of Oct'r. 
<a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a>, the Chief Clerk of the Treasury Department addressed a 
letter to the Pres. . of the Bank written obviously &amp; avowedly 
at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury for the pur 
pose of enabling the Pres. of the Bank to contradict certain 
statements about the three per cents which appeared in a 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> paper of the 12th of October. The letter, tho not 
itself written for publication, was written professedly as the 
basis of a publication by the Pres. of the Bank, and authorized him to vouch certain things. Having no taste for newspaperisms, the Pres. of the Bank never answered and indeed 
never read the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> paper, but if he had answered it, 
he would have asserted the fact vouched for by the following extract of the letter referred to, a letter written by the 
Chief Clerk of the Treas y at the request of the Secretary 
containing suggestions by the Secretary of what the Pres of the Bank ought to publish. The suggestion was in these words : 
</p><p>
"Nor has the Treasury any reason to object to the course 
"which the Bank has pursued in regard to the European 
"holders of the 3 per cents. On the contrary that measure 
"appears wise &amp; prudent, &amp; well adapted to prevent the 
"embarrassments which the sudden withdrawal of so much 
"foreign capital from the country would necessarily produce." 
</p><p>
This was on the 14th of Oct'r. <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a>. 
</p><p>
Another reason of the surprize of the Pres. of the Bank was that on the of November <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a> he was waited upon by 
</p><p>
the Chief Clerk of the Treasury who announced himself as 
coming from the Secretary of the Treasury to make enquiry 
about the Certificates of stock. The Chief Clerk stated not 
once nor casually, but frequently &amp; emphatically, what he 
had written on the 14 th of October, that the Secretary was 
perfectly satisfied with the measure itself, but only desired 
that the Certificates should appear soon in order that the 
doubts of others might be removed, &amp; he pressed the Pres. 
of the Bank to write a letter to the Secretary explaining the 
matter. In consequence of this request, the Pres. of the Bank 
wrote a letter to the Secretary on the . If it had not 
</p><p>
been clearly &amp; repeatedly stated that the Secretary was 
entirely satisfied &amp; wanted only the means of satisfying 
others undoubtedly this letter would never have been writ 
ten. The Pres*. of the Bank did not know did not wish to 
know, &amp; certainly would never have asked to know what the 
opinions of the Secretary were on the subject. The communication therefore to him that the Treasury deemed the measure wise &amp; prudent, and that the Secretary was satisfied 
with it was wholly gratuitous and in truth it might as well 
have been spared, since really it does not seem strictly proper 
to treat the Bank in this way to denounce its measures in 
public at the same time that you praise them in private. 
</p><p>
The Pres. of the Bank was also surprized at that passage 
in the report of the Secretary he states that various considerations "have suggested an enquiry into the Security of the 
Bank as the depository of the public funds." 
</p><p>
His surprize arose from two circumstances. 
</p><p>
The first was that on the 3 I st of Oct'r. <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a>, the Secretary 
addressed to him a letter requesting to know what the Bank 
would give for 3,919,666.66 francs about $700,000 being 
the first instalment of the French indemnity. In that letter 
he stated that " it would be sufficient for the Treasury to receive a credit for the amount in the Bank of the U.S. one 
month after the payment of the bill in Paris say on the 2d of 
March next," adding that " if as I presume an arrangement 
for the transfer May be best made with the Bank, I will 
thank you to state the terms." 
</p><p>
It seems strange, that the Secretary at the same time that 
he announces to Congress his fears about the solvency of the 
Bank, should ask that very Bank to take in its own hands 
$700,000 additional money of the public, not to be paid for 
until the 3 d of March next. 
</p><p>
The other reason of surprize is that the Secretary on the 
</p><p>
requested to know of the Bank what it would give 
</p><p>
for a bill on London for the 3 d instalment of the Danish indemnity amounting to about $244,000. Here then the Secretary, in the midst of his anxiety for the safety of the public 
monies in the Bank, actually proposes to place no less than a million of dollars more of that very public money in that very Bank sure never was insolvency so much flattered before.
