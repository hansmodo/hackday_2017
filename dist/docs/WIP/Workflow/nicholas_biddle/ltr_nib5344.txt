My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I understand, tho at second hand, that a gentleman 
has arrived from Cin 1 who states that he heard the inaugural 
read and that it speaks of the necessity of a national 
Bank, &amp; almost recommends it. You may have heard this 
elsewhere but I mention it that you might be prepared to 
modify it if you think it should be modified. On the whole I 
should think the expediency of announcing that purpose so 
early was questionable. It does not seem to me necessary in 
the inaugural however it may do in the message to the 
new Congress and I should think it might rally at once the 
opposition on topics that might be turned to mischief against 
the new administration before it had time to strengthen itself.
