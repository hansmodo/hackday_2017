My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
... If there be any one principle upon which we 
have acted, with the most fastidious care, it is, to treat the 
State authorities with the greatest respect, and in all our 
intercourse with them to blend the utmost perseverance in 
asserting the rights of the Bank, with the utmost courtesy 
to all who opposed them. . . .
