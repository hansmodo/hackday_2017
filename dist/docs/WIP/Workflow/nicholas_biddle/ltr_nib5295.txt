My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have received today your favor of the 26 th inst. 
with the copy of the Governor's Message. 2 I regret on many 
accounts that paper. It will prolong the distress now existing 
without effecting any good object, and it is melancholy to see 
a Governor of Pennsylvania thus aiding in the destruction of 
Pennsylvania interests. What makes it more shocking is, that 
up to the very moment of sending the message, those who 
visited him left him under the strongest conviction that he 
was decidedly friendly to the Bank. In truth he ought to have 
been, for so far from frustrating his loan, the Bank actually 
furnished to Mess 8 . Allen the means of paying the last instalment, as the Governor well knew. Of the effect of his message 
on the Bank and upon the financial concerns of Penns a . you will form some idea when I mention to you the following fact which is a little singular. 
</p><p>
A Committee from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> has been visiting the Bank for the purpose of procuring some relief for that city which 
would of course have reacted on our own State. Yesterday the Board was to have decided it, &amp; I have no doubt that the Bank 
would have made an effort to give relief but when we saw the Governors message saw how totally useless the efforts 
of the Bank had been to sustain the credit of the State in appeasing the spirit of the party and how little reliance 
could be placed on the men in power, we determined that it was in vain to make an effort and accordingly, instead 
of sending the relief expected, we wrote to the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
Committee that the conduct of the Governor of Pennsylvania obliged the Bank to look to its own safety, and that therefore 
we declined doing any thing at present. 
</p><p>
So much for the first effect of the Governors patriotism
