My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had last evening the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 21st inst. and immediately hasten to perform the 
sacred duty of defending the character of an honest man from the reptiles who avenge themselves for his superiority while 
living, by crawling over his dead body. I think we shall be perfectly successful in presenting the following results. 
</p><p>
The argument in the case of McCullock &amp; the State of Maryland began, according to your statement on the 22d of 
Feb'y <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, &amp; the decision of the court was pronounced on the 17th of March <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>. 
</p><p>
Now of the 17 shares owned by the Judge Marshall on the 
1st of Jan'y . <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, 12 were transferred on the 8th of Feb'y. 
<a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, under a power given by Judge Marshall on the 5th of 
Feb'y. <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>. 
</p><p>
For the remaining 5 he gave a power to transfer them on 
the 21st of Jan'y . <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, though the transfer was not actually 
made on the Books until the 26 th of March <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>. 
</p><p>
So that in point of fact he was ostensibly the owner of five 
shares at the time of the decision. 
</p><p>
Finding this I sent for Mr Cope, one of the Director's of 
the Bank of the U.S. and nephew of the Mr Thomas V. Cope 
named in the power of Atty. &amp; requested him to examine 
the books of the House &amp; endeavored to find the evidences of 
what I have no doubt was the fact, that Judge Marshall sold 
the Stock at the time of giving the power of Attorney on the 
21st of January, and that the purchaser neglected to send it 
on till March to be transferred. 
</p><p>
I have kept my letter open in order to give the result of Mr Cope's enquiries, but as the period is so remote he has not 
been able to complete his examination, &amp; promises to let me 
know further tomorrow. He thinks however that he has ascertained that this stock was sent to the House by some per 
son in Virg a with other parcels of stock to be transferred, &amp; 
that the probility is that the correspondent in Virg a had purchased these five shares &amp; paid for them. 
</p><p>
I will postpone till tomorrow therefore the further examination, &amp; in the meantime send inclosed a certificate from 
the Transfer Office &amp; certified copies of the powers of Attorney on file. It may be well to add, that in the power of Att y 
of the 21st of Jany. <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, there is a blank for the name of the 
Att'y and that the blank is filled up with the name of Thomas P Cope in the handwriting of Th 03 P Cope himself, whence I 
infer that the power was given in blank by Judge Marshall 
with the certificate &amp; sent to Mr Th os P Cope by his correspondent in Virg a . . .
