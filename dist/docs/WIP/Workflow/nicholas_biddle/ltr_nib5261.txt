My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor announcing your arrival &amp; your second giving the result of your first interview are received. I have 
not had yet an opportunity of apprizing our friends S. &amp; C. 1 
of the state of things but shall do so this afternoon. The views 
of Mr M. are sufficiently discouraging, &amp; I shall wait anxiously for the further lights which you will give. 
</p><p>
I inclose a paper of which I have no other copy which therefore you will have the goodness to send back when you 
have no further occasion for it, or to bring it if you come soon. It is an extract from the minutes of the old Bank of the U.S. 
by which you will perceive that as early as the 6th of Jan y <a href='/results.php?year=1807'>1807</a> 
four years before the expiration of the charter, and when it had nearly as long to run as ours has, the stockholders met 
&amp; prepared a memorial which was not however presented until 
the following session of Congress say <a href='/results.php?year=1808'>1808</a> (as this is the 
substance of the extract it is not worth while to send it)* 
</p><p>
* Whence may be argued that if they began so early, we 
involved or provoked as we have been, cannot be reproached 
with a premature movement. I am particularly anxious to 
know the opinion of <a href='/results.php?tla=gmd' rel='colleague'>Mr. McDuffie</a> in whose judgment in this 
matter I have the highest confidence. 
</p>
