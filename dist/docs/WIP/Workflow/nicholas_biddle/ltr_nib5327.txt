My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . The Bank of the U. States owes about six millions of dollars to the Gov't  payable by instalments due in Sept 
nxt Sep. i839~Sep. <a href='/results.php?year=1840'>1840</a>. Now the Bank might anticipate 
these payments at once, and put the Gov't  in funds for its 
pressing wants. In this Settlement, as it is the payment of a 
debt and does not come under the Same line as the ordinary 
revenue there need be no operation of specie payment or 
any other payment, for the public creditor would be too 
happy to receive a draft on the Bank with the option of asking 
specie for it if he choose to demand it, just as the Secretary 
of the Navy last year paid the pensioners. 
</p><p>
The first effect of such an arrangement would be to quiet the 
minds of the people as to what is regarded as the hostility of 
the Govt. to the Banks the most serious obstacle at present to a general restoration of the Currency and it would 
go further than any other measure I know to promote that object. An easy consequence of this would be a return to some 
thing like the ancient habits of inter course between the Bank 
&amp; the Govt. which would lead to this result. I think that the 
Gov*. may be satisfied that no System could work better than 
that of the late Bank of the U.S. Now the present Bank is only 
the late Bank with no change except in the origin of its char 
ter. Its whole machinery can be remounted in twenty four 
hours and thence forward it can, without difficulty, engage 
to receive &amp; disburse the public funds in every part of the 
U.S. without any charge whatever, in specie or its equivalent, at the option of the public creditor. If therefore by a simple 
arrangement of that Kind with the Bank, you can restore 
the administration of the funds to its former footing, you 
accomplish several objects. The first of course is that the work 
of the Govt. is well done. The second is that you are relieved 
from all connection in detail with a multitude of banks, the 
fruitful source of trouble &amp; political danger. Then you get rid 
of the debatable question of the National Bank You avoid 
the embarrassment of retracting any fixed opinions you 
restore in the most effectual way you can, at least you con 
tribute as far as you can to restore, the currency. 
</p><p>
Finally, you thus get peace not a bad thing at any time 
but a remarkably good thing at this time. For myself 
this business of Texas, and a much more important matter 
which I project, make me desire to close up these old sources 
of discontent. I am therefore singularly pacific &amp; amiable 
just now. 
</p><p>
It seems to me then, that you have an opportunity of making a political movement a coup d etat worth trying. 
I believe that at this moment a reconciliation between the Bank &amp; the Govt. would do more both at home &amp; abroad to 
settle our troubles than any other measure that could be 
adopted. Its influence here in disarming the hostility of those 
who consider the Govt. as indisposed to the credit system, you 
may estimate better than I can. This could be done simply 
by putting aside the Sub treasury bill, and all other projects, 
and leaving the whole matter on the footing of the resolution 
of <a href='/results.php?year=1816'>1816</a>, which would make it the subject of treasury regulation. 
</p><p>
Having thus unburdened my mind, I leave the rest to you, 
if you think the suggestion worth following out. If not, it ofcourse rests between ourselves, as no one will be aware of the &gt;. 
contents of this letter. The negociation for anticipating the ^ 
first instalment is going on under the auspices of the gentle 
man who has had charge of it but the occasion seems a 
good one to follow out the mere intended arrangement here suggested.
