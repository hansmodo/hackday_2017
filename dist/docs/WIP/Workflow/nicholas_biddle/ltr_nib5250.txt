My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I take the earliest opportunity which my occupations 
have permitted to consult you on the subject of attempting 
the renewal of the Charter during the present session of 
Congress. 
</p><p>
Until the arrival of the President's message my impressions 
were these. I believed that there was a decided majority of 
both houses of Congress who, if they had been obliged to vote 
at all, would have voted for the renewal. But not being 
obliged to vote, they would avoid voting. Many would say 
that the question was premature, that they ought not to forestal the judgment of their successors, that it was a short 
session in short the indifferent &amp; the timid would combine with the opponents of the Bank to postpone the question. Once brought forward &amp; postponed, it would of course 
be blended up with the elections, &amp; become one of those political matters judged exclusively by party considerations. 
</p><p>
On the other hand if it passed through both Houses, &amp; was 
negatived by the Pres e ., from that time forward it would 
become a question between the Bank &amp; him, &amp; if he were 
reflected, he would construe it as a decision by the nation 
against the Bank, &amp; act accordingly. There was also not un- 
mingled with these views the hope that as the President had 
mentioned the subject to Congress he would have left it to 
them, &amp; that time &amp; experience would have made him more 
wise &amp; less pertinacious. Such seemed the state of the case 
in November. 
</p><p>
It is certainly much altered now. 
</p><p>
The President has himself again thrust it before Congress, 
&amp; seems determined to make it an electioneering topic. By 
inviting the State Gov ts . to strengthen themselves by usurp 
ing the whole circulating medium of the country, he will 
probably excite them to instruct their delegations in Con 
gress to oppose the charter, &amp; it is to be presumed that in 
no event will he sanction a bill for the re-charter. . . . 
</p><p>
I believe it greatly for the interest of the country to settle 
this question during the present session. My doubt is whether 
it would be expedient in reference to the ultimate settlement 
of that question for the Bank to ask for a renewal. But the 
benefit of settling it may possibly be obtained without the risk 
of prejudicing the Bank in case of failure by another course 
which is this. 
</p><p>
The Committee of Ways &amp; Means 1 have now the President's Message before them. If that Comm'e. were to say that 
this is a question which must not be left in its present position, that all the great interests of the country are hazarded 
by this suspense, &amp; altho they did not intend to stir it, yet now that it has been agitated it ought to be put to rest if 
they would say this, the way would be open. If the Comm e . 
were to say to the Bank whether it would take at once the renewal &amp; on what terms, we should answer by return of mail 
in a manner no doubt satisfactory, &amp; the Comm e . might 
then report a bill of a single section continuing the Charter 
for twenty years after the expiration of its present charter on 
the payment of the stipulated bonus. In this way the recharter would present itself, not so much in the light of an application by individuals, but as a financial measure, introduced 
by the financial organ of the House. If it succeeded well. If it failed, the Bank might hereafter come forward with 
its proposal without prejudice of its having been once defeated. . . .
