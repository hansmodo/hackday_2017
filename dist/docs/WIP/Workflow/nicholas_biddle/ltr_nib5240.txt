Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I received this morning your favor of the 10th . inst. 
which I have read with great pleasure. The view it presents 
are quite sound &amp; correspond exactly with those entertained 
here. My impression is that these opinions expressed by the 
President are entirely &amp; exclusively his own, and that they 
should be treated as the honest tho erroneous notions of one 
who intends well. We have never had any idea of applying to 
Congress for a renewal of the Charter at the present session 
and of course should abstain from doing so now. Our 
whole system of conduct is one of abstinence and self defence
