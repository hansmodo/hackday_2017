... I can now say with the utmost confidence that the whole is a paltry intrigue got up by a combination of small 
bankrupts &amp; smaller Demagogues that if the choice were to be made again, we ought to choose Mr Mason and that 
to have him out or not to support him fully would be to suffer ourselves to be tramped down by the merest rabble. . . .
