Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . We are obliged to receive and glad to receive nominations from any respectable quarter, &amp; always treat them 
with respect but you must not suspect that any particular 
consideration is given to nominations from Washington. With 
Washington, in its character as the seat of Gov , the Bank 
has no concern. It has in fact nothing to do with the Gov, 
except that in administering the national finances, it will give 
its aid cordially and sincerely to every administration. But 
with no administration will it have any political connexion. 
Nor would the influence of the President and all the Departments put together be sufficient to appoint a single Director 
who was not considered qualified for his trust. This independence forms the point of honor with the Bank. You must 
not, therefore, believe for a moment, that any influence from 
any quarter could interfere with the regular course of our 
nominations or prevent our consulting you and our friends 
in <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a> on a subject of so much importance as the choice 
of those to whom the prosperity of the Bank is entrusted.
