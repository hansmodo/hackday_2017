My dear sir 
</p><p>
The failure of the Bank of Washington confirms the opinion, entertained by you in regard to the District Banks 
and I think renders more and more expedient the course recommended in my last. The Bank has been obliged to day 
to decline the same kind of assistance to a Bank in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. 
</p><p>
It becomes us to be specially careful of the Institution at the present moment, and that care I am sure you will always bestow.
