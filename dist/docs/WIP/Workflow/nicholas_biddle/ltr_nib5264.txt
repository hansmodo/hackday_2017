My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
The Bank having after great consideration presented 
a memorial for the renewal of the charter, the citizens of Philad are forwarding petitions on the subject of a similar 
measure [which] will be transmitted by the State Banks. It 
would be greatly desirable to have the same thing done else 
where. I have written to-day to our friend Col. Perkins &amp; I wish 
you &amp; our other friends would endeavour to have a strong &amp; 
general expression of the sense of your community so that Congress may be apprized of the real sentiments of the country.
