Dear sir 
</p><p>
I have just seen a letter from Harrisburg stating that in a bill for chartering the Bank of the U.S. which is under 
stood to be now before a Committee of which you are Chairman, it is contemplated to introduce a provision 1 that if the 
Bank "interferes with politics, its charter may be repealed" 
and another "prohibiting the Bank from publishing documents." I lose no time in stating to you, that if such provisions, or any thing in the remotest degree resembling them 
shall be put into the charter, it will be instantly rejected by the Stockholders. They have not asked for this charter and 
certainly could not accept it on terms which might be construed into a reproach on their past administration of its affairs
