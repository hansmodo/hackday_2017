My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
There is one topic in my letter to you of this day, on 
which I did not wish to enlarge lest it might appear invidious, but which is very fruitful of admonition. The truth is, that 
almost all the misfortunes of the Bank of the United States, are traceable, directly or indirectly, to politics. In Kentucky 
the losses were in a great measure incurred by loans to prominent politicians of all sides whose influence procurred them 
undue facilities which ended, as frequently happens, in such cases, by ruining them as well as cripling the Branches. These 
things have made us sensitive on that point, &amp; unwilling to see any great political influence introduced, which might lead 
to a recurrence of similar misfortunes.
