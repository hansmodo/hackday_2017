Dear Sir 
</p><p>
The last mail brought me your favor of the II th inst 
which shall not fail to receive immediate attention as soon 
as we hear from the Branch at <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> on the subject. 
As yet we have had no communication whatever in regard 
to it. 
</p><p>
I regret very much the decision of the House on <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay's</a> resolutions : for its effect will I fear be to render the state of 
the country much more embarrassing during the summer. 
The House have it now in their power, by passing those resolutions, to give immediate and general relief to the country. 
If the House by however small a majority, were to order 
the restoration of the Deposits, no matter whether it were 
vetoed or signed by the Pres., it would not only relieve the 
Senate from the reproach of siding against the Pres. and the people but it would establish such a relation between the 
Congress and the Bank, as would induce the latter to make 
great efforts to restore confidence and prosperity. With such 
a vote of Congress, twenty-four hours would be sufficient to 
establish peace, and to insure the return of better times for 
the country. On that subject my convictions are strong 
</p><p>
"and were it not for the misinterpretation to which it would 
be liable, I should go down &amp; talk with you all about it. 
</p><p>
Do you think it practicable to carry the resolutions? The 
majority was 20 which requires a change of only n votes. 
Now I have no doubt that many members like Mr King of 
Georgia, who are well disposed even to recharter the Bank, 
but despairing of the recharter, think the restoration of the 
deposites without being followed by a certainty of a recharter, would benefit neither the country. In this they are mistaken. I think for instance I could venture to say that if such 
a vote were secured, the Bank would feel no reluctance in 
giving one, or if necessary, two millions of loans to Louisiana 
as requested for her relief. This could be done because such 
a vote is peace and harmony &amp; confidence between the Bank 
&amp; the Congress. In truth I know of no way in which all the 
interest on the Western waters could be more immediately &amp; 
substantially advanced than by such a vote, which it would 
be in the power of Eleven men, who are sent to Congress to promote these interests, to give in a few days. Could not that 
resolution be brought up? I should think there were men 
enough in the House to do that good service to their section 
of the country, even if it did cost them a frown at the Palace. 
If you suppose it is at all feasible &amp; that I can promote it, 
</p><p>
I have the goodness to let me know and in the mean time 
</p><p>
believe me
