My dear Son 
</p><p>
. . . Everything goes on very comfortably here. You may judge of the relation in which the Govt. and the Bank 
stand when I tell you that a few minutes ago a gentleman left me having come directly from Washington charged with 
a communication from Mr Poinsett. Among other things he said Mr Poinsett took occasion to speak to Blair in the 
presence of Mr Van Beuren, about the Bank; and that the President desired Blair not to attack the Bank or myself 
any more. Mr. Poinsett himself moreover wrote an article for the Globe, explaining the late Circular issued by the 
Cover 1 ., directing the Officers to disburse the notes of the Bank. This article Blair was obliged to publish, adding some 
remarks of his own, just enough to save his own consistency. I will try to enclose the two articles. . . .
