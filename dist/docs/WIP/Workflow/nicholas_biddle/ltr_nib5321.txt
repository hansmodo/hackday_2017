My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Referring to my letter of yesterday's date, I now in 
close a memorandum furnished by Mr Caleb Cope by which 
it will appear that the Stock in the name of Judge Marshall 
was received from Mr John V. Wilcox of Petersburg V a . 
That gentleman is still living, &amp; could probably explain the 
terms on which he received it from the Judge. I have now furnished all the materials within my reach, but I shall follow 
the subject with great interest, and will be much gratified 
at hearing from you the result of your enquiries, the fame of 
that upright man being the common property of us all. 
</p>
