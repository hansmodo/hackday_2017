My dear Sir 
</p><p>
You are a magician greater than Van Buren, &amp; with 
all your professions against Masonry, you are an absolute 
right worshipful Grand Master. I received yesterday your 
letter of the 2y th ult. and to day I write the letter to the Govt. 
of which of which I annex a copy. This is worth to you a 
dozen resumptions. On that subject you will talk all the truth 
you dare, and if you can persuade our worthy friends that \ 
this is a matter to be decided exclusively by business &amp; not \ 
politics you will do good service to the good cause.
