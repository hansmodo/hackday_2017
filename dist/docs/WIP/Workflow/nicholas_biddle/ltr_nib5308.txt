Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have received your favor of the 8th ins 1 , and shall 
reply to it without the least reserve. 
</p><p>
In closing the concerns of the Bank, my great anxiety is to 
take care of its faithful Officers, and any thing which I can 
do to serve them, I will do most promptly and willingly. In 
your own particular case, I am not the less desirous of serving 
you because you have been comparatively a short time with 
us, for you have connected your fortunes with the Institution, and that is itself a claim upon me. My impression then 
is, that the Branch in Buffalo will be soon closed, and that 
in the contingency of a renewed charter under a state, the 
agencies of the Bank would be confined to the most mercantile points, as the general superintendence of the currency 
will no longer devolve on the Bank: so that the Bank would 
not require your services at Buffalo. I wish therefore that 
you may succeed in your application for the Cashiership of the Bank in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> and I will do all in my power to 
promote your views by communicating with Mr. Anderson. 
You will receive from Mr. Jaudon by to-days mail a suggestion with respect to another Bank, where he thinks you might 
be well placed. In short I beg you to believe that it will afford me very great pleasure to promote your views, being, 
with sincere regard l
