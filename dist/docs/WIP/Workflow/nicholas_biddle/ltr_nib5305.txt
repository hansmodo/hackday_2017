Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have this morning had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 8th inst. We have waited for the adjournment of 
Congress before taking any final course in regard to the Bank, because till then the movement of the Government was uncertain. The subject is now under examination by a Commit 
tee of the Board who will probably report in a day or two. My own individual opinion is, that having reached the point 
of entire safety &amp; being in some sort divorced from the Executive, the Bank is now at liberty to consult exclusively the 
interest of the Stockholders and the Community. In such a 
state of things it seems inexpedient to impose or to continue 
curtailments merely for the sake of any effect they might be 
presumed to produce abroad, and I shall not be surprized if 
further reductions of the loans should be suspended. No 
determination, however, is yet made, and therefore nothing 
should be said about it in your journal I should think at present.
