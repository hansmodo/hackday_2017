Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure last night of receiving your letter 
of the 2d inst, thank you with great cordiality for the 
friendly dispositions which dictated it. The course which 
I have hitherto prescribed to myself, has been neither to 
seek nor to shun a situation of so much responsibility, but 
if I am called to share in the administration of the Bank, 
I shall bring to its service at least a laborious &amp; zealous devotion to its interests. This unfortunate institution has 
from its birth been condemned to struggle with the most 
perplexing difficulties, yet even with all its embarrassments 
it has sustained the national currency &amp; rescued the country from the dominition of irresponsible banks, &amp; their 
depreciated circulation. The time has perhaps arrived when 
it may combine its own &amp; the country's security with a more 
enlarged development of its resources and a wider extension 
of its sphere of usefulness. To this object to which my own 
exertions shall be anxiously directed. I have long known and 
appreciated the manly &amp; decisive services which you have 
rendered to the same cause &amp; if I should see any occasion in which the Bank may avail itself of your assistance I 
shall ask it with the same frankness &amp; sincerity with which 
I now assure you of the great personal respect &amp; esteem of 
</p>
