My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . With regard to our late arrangements, they are 
simply these. It has been impossible hitherto while the officers of the Bank were so fully occupied with local duties to 
know as much as was necessary of a great many matters of the highest importance. For instance we have nearly two 
millions of real estate besides Banking houses, &amp; we have about nine millions of old &amp; new suspended debts. You 
know how apt real estate &amp; bad debts are to suffer for the 
want of looking after after. We therefore appointed an officer here to take care of those two concerns. Again, we have 
never had a sufficient knowledge of the accounts between the officers. It was thus that West the Cashier of New Orleans was enabled to defraud the Bank of $20,000 we 
wish to examine these accounts, &amp; we wish also to have our Exchange business particularly well managed. We have 
therefore appointed another Officer for those two purposes. With a view to attract gentlemen of first rate abilities, as the salaries are low ($<a href='/results.php?year=2500'>2500</a> for one &amp; $2,200 for 
the other) we have called them not Clerks but Assistant Cashiers. . . .
