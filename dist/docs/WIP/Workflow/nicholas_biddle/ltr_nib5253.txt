My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 8th : inst. inclosing a letter from Mr. Green, expressing his 
wish to borrow from the Bank twenty thousand dollars. I will submit it to the Board at their next meeting. In the mean 
time I can only say that it will receive from them a kind &amp; respectful consideration as a matter of business, without look 
ing to the past or the future. The Bank is glad to have friends from conviction, but seeks to make none from interest. For 
myself, I love the freedom of the Press too much to complain of its occasional injustice to me, &amp; if the loan be made, it 
shall be with a perfect understanding, to be put into the Note if necessary, that the borrower is to speak his mind about the 
Bank, just as freely as he did before which I take to be "ample room &amp; verge enough." 
</p>
