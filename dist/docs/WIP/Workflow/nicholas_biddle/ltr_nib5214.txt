My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
... I have no doubt that we could at once give to 
the Southern &amp; Western sections of the country two or three 
millions of sound &amp; useful circulating medium if we could 
sign that amount of 5 &amp; 10 dollars. But to make two mil 
lions of five dollar notes, it would be necessary to sign my 
name 40x3,000 times, which, to a person whose time is &amp; 
must be absorbed during the day by the duties of his station, is wholly impracticable. The application for this purpose was made to Congress some years ago, but it was ac 
companied by a request that Congress would alter the 
Charter so as to prevent the universal receivability of the 
notes. This I am satisfied from experience, as I was at the 
time from theory, is not desirable; &amp; all that the Bank now 
wants is, that it may carry into execution a purpose useful 
alike to itself &amp; to the community, by assisting in the diffusion of a wholesome currency. I wish therefore to consult 
you as to the best mode of presenting that subject to Congress. I have been for three years past so anxious to keep 
the Bank out of view in the political world &amp; bring it down to its true business character as a Counting House, that I 
have been very reluctant to apply to Congress for anything. ... I believe it to stand better with Congress than it did 
some time ago, but the political odour of sanctity is very evanescent &amp; if our purpose can be obtained without bring 
ing on two weeks debate upon the constitutionality of the Bank, the usurpations of the Supreme Court, &amp; omni scibile 
&amp; quibusdem aliis, it would be a great satisfaction. . . .
