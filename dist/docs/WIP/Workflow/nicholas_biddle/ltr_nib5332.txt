My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have but a moment, as usual, to write, as the Bank is closing, &amp; the mail for the Sirius going. 
The repeal of the Specie Circular has been followed by a fresh defeat in the rejection of the Sub-Treasury. Mr Buchanan has renewed the matter of the special deposit, but it will fail. 
</p><p>
In England we should have seen an instant change of ministry. Here ministers are engaged on wages for a year &amp; 
however they may misbehave, will serve out their term. On the 9th of July, Congress will adjourn and then the Administration, poor &amp; dispirited, will be brought to reason as wild beasts are tamed by hunger. 
</p><p>
Remember that whatever you may read to the contrary, the repeal of the Specie Circular &amp; the defeat of the Sub 
Treasury are the results, exclusively, of the course pursued 
by the Bank of the U.S. If we had done as the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
Banks had, succumbed to the Gov't  &amp; resumed when they did, it would have been a surrender at discretion. I was 
willing to risk the temporary overshadowing to have a permanent sunshine; and I think we shall soon have it. . .
