Dear sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 3O th inst. which I deemed so important, that before answering 
it, I consulted the Board at their meeting yesterday in the 
same confidential manner in regard to the subject of it. It is, as you are aware, a very delicate subject, one of which it is 
very difficult, and yet very necessary, to decide in advance, on the best course to be pursued. The opinion of the Board, 
which has my own entire concurrence, is this. 
</p><p>
The Bank of the United States has been compelled in self defence to diminish its business and call upon its debtors, and 
refuse to make loans to a very considerable amount. It is still doing so and shall do so for some time. If it had the means 
of lending, it would lend to its own customers. The State Banks have all had the same warning and should prepare 
themselves in the same way nor is it just that these Banks should call upon the Bank of the U S. for the funds which it 
has been husbanding for itself. If it is not just, neither is it safe. If there be trouble among the Banks, the only security 
is the Bank of the U. S. It holds its power as a trust for the ultimate protection of our banking system, the fate of which 
seems involved in that of the Bank of the U.S. and if we begin by venturing prematurely to the support of institutions 
which may be embarrassed, we may ourselves become too much weakened to make decisive efforts at a later stage of 
the disasters which are coming. 
</p><p>
Under these impressions, the Board have declined invariably for some time past numerous applications for loans from 
Banks. They think it decidedly best to abstain from making such loans. They think also that it is expedient to abstain 
from all pledges or promises of support to the Banks. We know not how far such engagements may lead us and 
until the Bank is strong enough to make some general movement for the benefit of the country: were [such] palliatives 
would rather endanger us than do permanent benefit to them. We have been very anxious to make you strong 
and are very desirous that you should continue so for 
which reason, we wish the Office to avoid every engagement 
that would commit its funds. ... In fact, the examination of 
the subject to which your letter has given rise, has brought to\ 
my notice the circumstance that I have inadvertently omitted! 
to apprize you of the wish of the Bank on the 22 nd of January \ 
last that you should bring your loans down fifty thousand dol 
lars below the amount at which they were fixed in October / 
and I mention it now to show you that we have looked to a/ 
reduction rather than an expansion of your business. On the 
whole we should much prefer that you avoid all engagements 
either for general or particular support of the Banks. 
</p><p>
In respect to the balances too, we are anxious that they 
should not be suffered to accumulate particularly as the 
want of confidence among the State Banks may make the \ 
Office the depository of their notes. Neither the notes nor the \ 
balances should remain long. The explosion of the Bank of 
Maryland found this Bank (at Phil'a ) in possession of $21,000 / 
of its notes and we shall in consequence pursue a course/ 
of more frequent settlements with the State Banks. 
</p><p>
I wish it were in my power to say that we might relieve the\ \ 
wants of the Banks near you. But I much fear that we could } J 
not do much ultimate good and at the present momen&gt; X y/ 
we must avoid diminishing our means, so as to keep thein 
unbroken when they may hereafter be most needed.
