My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will I am sure feel some interest in the inclosed 
paper which I have thought it advisable to publish in order 
to correct some deeply rooted prejudices against some of the 
measures of the last war. Having never taken any formal notice of them till now, I believed that after so long a time it 
was right to state distinctly what it was I had really done, to 
excite the violence of that period. As far as I can learn, its effect upon fair &amp; liberal minds has been such as I could wish. 
Nevertheless it will not contribute at all to my election 
which will be decided by very different considerations. Ac 
cording to the unfortunate system of nomination prevailing 
here, it is always in the power of a cabal to take from the 
people all share in the real business of an election. Thus for 
instance I was originally nominated by both sections of the 
Republican party by a Committee of the friends of Mr Findlay &amp; a Committee of the friends of Mr Heister. But the 
latter were so anxious to secure his election, that finding the 
federalists unwilling [to] vote for their candidate Mr Heister 
unless Mr Heister's friends in return would vote for the federal 
members of Congress, they reassembled &amp; in order to secure 
the federal votes for Mr Heister gave up their Congress ticket 
altho it had been formally agreed upon &amp; published. My sup 
port therefore will be from one section only of the republicans 
the other at the head of whom is Duane opposing my election, not as he himself avowed to a friend of mine from any 
personal hostility to me, but because I was well disposed to 
the administration of the general gov. Another very efficient 
motive with that individual is that my nomination excluded 
his own son. Such are the springs which move our election. 
The district is in truth a perfect chaos of small factions &amp; as 
I have shunned all participation in their intrigues I do not 
anticipate the slightest chance of being elected. The only 
object of any importance is to rally the sound part of the 
population against the decided hostility to the general gov. 
which animates some of the demagogues &amp; that I think 
can be accomplished. Will you present my best respects to <a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mrs Monroe</a> . . . 
</p><p>
The opposition is formed of a union of the federalists with 
the friends of Mr Heister. The latter consist of two divisions, 
one willing to sacrifice every thing for Mr Heister, the other 
at the head of whom is Duane, in addition to the same motive 
are stimulated by the pleasure of opposing one whom they 
know to be friendly to the administration of the general gov. 
This reason is distinctly avowed by their leader who at the 
same time professes to have no personal hostility to me. Such 
are the secret springs which will control the election. 
</p><p>
To the Electors of the City and County of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
and the County of Delaware. 
</p><p>
I understand that many estimable persons among you, retain unkind feelings toward me from a belief that during the 
late war, I proposed to establish in Pennsylvania the French 
system of military conscription. This reproach was widely 
circulated at that period. But I was then too anxious about 
the defence of the country, to care about defending myself, 
and I therefore never in any way noticed it, presuming that 
when the violence of party passions should subside, men 
would return to more just and liberal sentiments. I should 
still persevere in the same silence, but I think it due to those 
gentlemen, who have done me the honor to connect my name 
with the approaching election for members of congress, to 
remove an impression which may be injurious. If then it be 
true, that there is any individual, who forgetting the dangers of the war, remembers only its prejudices, he will perhaps 
find in the following statement, some reason to think that he 
has been unjust to me. 
</p><p>
The assertion is, that I proposed to introduce the French 
system of conscription. 
</p><p>
The fact is, that I never proposed any thing resembling the 
French conscription; that what I did propose, was a system 
practised in Pennsylvania, long before the French conscription was in existence; and that the very design and effect 
of it was to avoid a conscription, that is a militia draft which 
is in principle, very nearly the same mode of levying troops. 
</p><p>
A few words will make this evident. The French system of 
conscription is this. All the men between twenty and twenty-five years of age, are divided into classes. When a class is called into service, each man of the class must find a substitute or march, or what to the mass of the citizens is 
precisely the same thing, pay sixteen dollars a month. The 
nature of the two services is of course different, from the 
peculiar circumstances, and the different forms of government 
in the two countries; but as mere modes of military levy 
they are evidently similar. 
</p><p>
Now what I have proposed was this. Every twenty-two 
men above eighteen years of age, were to furnish a soldier to 
serve for the defence of the state, during twelve months. If 
they did not, the proper officer was to provide one, and di 
vide the expense among the twenty-two. But before doing 
this, such of the twenty-two as were liable to military duty 
drew lots. If the person on whom the lot fell consented to 
serve, he received a contribution of two hundred dollars from 
his neighbors. If he did not, the price of a substitute should 
exceed two hundred dollars, he was to pay the excess, which 
was limited to two hundred dollars more. 
</p><p>
All this might be a good or a bad system, but one thing at 
least is clear, that it is totally unlike the French system, and 
much less like the French conscription than our own militia 
law, which it was intended to supercede. 
</p><p>
But in fact, the mode of raising a military force at that 
time, was not a question of general policy, but of immediate 
expediency not how to frame a permanent system, but how 
to provide against a sudden emergency. It was necessary to 
raise within ten weeks, that is between the middle of January, before which no law could pass, and the month of April, 
when <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> might be assailed, an adequate force for 
its protection. To procure these troops by voluntary enlistments, was utterly hopeless; for the United States army had, 
during more than two years, gleaned every idler in the state; 
and even had there been time, the commonwealth had neither 
land to promise, nor bounty money to pay to recruits. To rely 
exclusively on occasional drafts of militia, hastily levied at 
every fresh alarm, was to entrust the fate of the city to a system the most oppressive to the citizen, the most expensive 
to the community, and the least efficient against the enemy. 
Believing then the voluntary enlistment too slow and too 
dear, and the militia draft too weak and too burdensome, 
I proposed that which promised to be at once prompt, equal, 
and efficient. I thought then, and I think still, that it had 
many decided advantages over the other plans. The first, 
and the most important was, that by it, and by it alone could 
nine thousand well officered men be brought into the field in 
six weeks, without any demand on the state treasury the 
second was, that being chiefly composed of substitutes who 
would probably reinlist, the force could be retained as long as 
it should be wanted the third was, that it was much more 
favourable to the poorer citizens, than the militia law. By that 
law, if a militia man leaves home, neither he nor his family 
receive any indemnity; and if he stays at home, he pays for 
a years delinquency, one hundred and ninety-two dollars. 
By the proposed bill, if he left home he received two hundred 
dollars; if he staid at home he paid, except in an extraordinary 
case, only the twenty-second part of the price of a substitute. 
Instead moreover of being a dangerous novelty, it had all 
the merit of successful experience. It was an old Pennsylvania plan. In the year <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, a law passed dividing the people 
into classes, each of which was to furnish a man to serve in 
the army of the United States during the war, and a delinquent class was to pay fifteen pounds specie or current money, 
equivalent, which was one thousand one hundred and twenty-five pounds currency. 
</p><p>
A second act, passed in <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>, by which, if a class was delinquent, a substitute was to be procured without limitation of price, at the expense of the class. 
</p><p>
A comparison of the levy of <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, with that of <a href='/results.php?year=1815'>1815</a>, will 
show how little reason <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> would have had to com 
plain of the latter. By the law of <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, the city and county 
of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> was bound to furnish eight hundred and 
ninety-five men, to serve in the United States army during 
the war. By the proposed law, the city and county, with per 
haps three times the population, and twenty times the wealth 
of <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, would have been bound to furnish, for its own exclusive defence during one year, about one thousand, or eleven 
hundred men. 
</p><p>
Let me now ask any fair and candid man, in what part of 
this proposed measure is there any thing unjust or oppressive 
any thing which violates the rights, or wounds the interests 
of a single individual if it be not milder than the militia 
law more practicable than an enlistment system and 
unless the city was prepared to submit quietly to shame and 
pillage, what mode of organizing resistance could be more im 
mediate, energetic and just? But supposing it not to be the 
best plan, supposing it to be a wrong plan. That would be 
a fit reason for preferring some other, but it surely is not a 
fair subject of reproach against the proposer, who could not 
possibly have had any personal or selfish motive, and who, if 
he erred, could have been mislead only by mistaken zeal. So 
unwilling indeed was I, that any mere pride of opinion on my 
part should interfere with the public service, that I at the 
same time, supported and voted for an enlistment bill, under an impression that the few who could be raised by it, would 
be at least so much gained for our defence and when my 
own proposal was lost in the house of representatives, was 
one of a committee who immediately proposed a bill for 
raising volunteers, on which the senate were engaged the 
day when peace was announced. 
</p><p>
I proposed and supported these measures from a conviction, that the state of the country demanded a vigorous 
effort to save it, and I should have consented to any thing 
which would call forth its resources without being very fastidious as to forms. And truly if eight thousand men were 
willing to come from the interior to our assistance, it did 
seem to be a matter of utter insignificance to the citizens 
of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, whether they came out of classes of twenty- 
two, or classes of any other number. That they came at 
all that they came well armed well officered and well 
paid might, I think, have satisfied the most scrupulous, 
and furnished an apology at least for the system which 
brought them. 
</p><p>
I have now finished the original purpose of this note, but 
the subject induces me to add a few words on the general 
measures of that time. 
</p><p>
In the autumn of <a href='/results.php?year=1814'>1814</a>, I was elected to represent this 
district in the senate. You all remember the condition of 
the country. Washington had been taken <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> at 
tacked a large British fleet and army were on the coast, 
able suddenly to strike any assailable point. Against this 
danger, <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> was totally unprepared. She relied on 
the general government, until the failure of the military 
proposals in congress announced to the states, that they 
must provide for their own safety. From that moment it became my duty to secure the means of defending the capital. It was manifest that unless a force could be collected 
before the navigation of the Delaware opened, Philadelphia was at the mercy of the enemy. We wanted then a 
naval defence we wanted a stationary land force, in 
aid of the militia we wanted arms we wanted money. 
That none of these were neglected, will be seen by the legislative journals of that day, which I cite, because they offer 
a simple and unquestionable statement of facts. 
</p><p>
Extract the Senate Journal, <a href='/results.php?year=1814'>1814</a>-15, p. 104. January 
4th, <a href='/results.php?year=1815'>1815</a>. 
</p><p>
"A motion was made by Mr. Biddle and Mr. Lowrie, and 
read as follows. Resolved, that a committee be appointed 
to inquire into the expediency of raising by drafts from the 
militia, a corps of eight thousand men, to serve during 
twelve months for the defence of Pennsylvania and the 
adjoining states, with leave to report by bill or otherwise. 
Resolved, that the same committee be instructed to in 
quire into the expediency of procuring one or more steam 
frigates, steam batteries, or other means of defence for the 
protection of the shores of Delaware, with leave to report 
by bill or otherwise. Resolved, that the same committee be 
instructed to inquire into the expediency of borrowing a 
sum not exceeding one million of dollars, to be employed 
solely for the defence of this state with leave to report 
by bill or otherwise. 
</p><p>
"On motion, said resolutions were severally read, considered, and adopted, and ordered that Mr. Biddle, Mr. Lowrie, Mr. Forster, Mr. Frailey and Mr. Beale, be a committee for the purpose expressed in said resolutions." 
</p><p>
In two days January 6th, <a href='/results.php?year=1815'>1815</a>. Page no. 
</p><p>
"Mr. Biddle from the committee appointed for the purpose on the fourth instant, reported an act to raise a military force for the defence of this commonwealth." This passed the senate on the I4th of January. 
</p><p>
On the I3th January Page 128. 
</p><p>
"Mr. Biddle from the committee appointed for the pur 
pose on the fourth instant reported a bill entitled an act 
to authorize a loan of one million of dollars, for the defence 
of this commonwealth." The loan was to be at seven per 
cent, and to be applied exclusively "to defray any expenses 
which may be incurred in military or naval preparations 
for the defence of this commonwealth." 
</p><p>
On investigation it appeared that the steam frigates 
could not be built in time, and that the approach to the 
city might be adequately defended, by strengthening the 
United States flotilla in the Delaware. It consisted of 
twenty-seven boats and vessels, but such was the desperate 
state of the recruiting service, that this armament had only 
about one fifth of its complement; and a large part of its 
crew were to be discharged in April. The commander was 
requested to state distinctly, what number of men would 
render his flotilla perfectly efficient, and what bounties 
would procure them. He did so, but, that in a service so 
important nothing should be left to hazard, the number of 
men as well as the bounties, were increased beyond his esti 
mates. 
Accordingly, January 25th, <a href='/results.php?year=1815'>1815</a>: 
</p><p>
"Mr. Biddle read in his place, and on permission presented to the chair a bill, entitled An act granting additional emoluments to seamen, employed in the defence of this commonwealth. " This bill passed February 1st. 
</p><p>
Of arms the state possessed enough to equip the new 
levies, (Senate Journal, p. 21,) but that every thing which 
promised to be useful, might be pressed into the public 
service. 
</p><p>
"On motion of Mr. Biddle and Mr. Graham, the follow 
ing resolution was twice read, considered, and adopted. Re 
solved, That a committee be appointed to inquire into the 
nature and advantages of Chamber's repeating guns, and 
the expediency of employing them in the service of the 
state." Senate Journal, p. 46. 
</p><p>
Page 67. "Mr. Biddle, from the committee appointed 
on the 1 5th, to inquire into the nature and advantages of 
Chamber's repeating guns, made report as follows," &amp;c. 
&amp;c. Concluding with a resolution to purchase fifty swivels, 
and to have five hundred muskets altered to the new plan. 
</p><p>
These documents prove that, within a few days after 
the duty of protecting the capital, devolved on the legislature, an efficient system of defence was proposed and 
passed in the Senate; a system, which before the month of 
April, would have placed between <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and its enemy, a strong flotilla, capable of being speedily reinforced, 
by all the naval resources of the city; and a well officered army in aid of the local militia; a system, which would 
have shielded the city from all danger and all alarm during the war. 
</p><p>
Of the energy and patriotism of those gentlemen, from 
the interior, who co-operated with me, and who, although 
remote from the capital, readily and zealously took their 
share in its defence, I can never speak nor feel too warmly. 
Nor did I permit myself to question the motives of those 
who opposed any of these measures. I knew them too well, not to ascribe their opposition to a fair and honourable 
difference of opinion. But I also had some right to a liberal 
construction of my own views. In executing the duties as 
signed to me, I had endeavoured to do what was useful, not 
what was agreeable; and never having sought to please, 
not to have pleased, would have been a subject neither of 
surprise, nor mortification. But I could not easily anticipate, that after a laborious and anxious struggle to pro 
vide for the defence of my own native city against foreign 
enemies, after securing the aid of patriotic men from the 
country, willing to partake in the expense and the dangers 
of that defence, I should become an object of denunciation 
in that very city; should have been put under a sort of 
political proscription, avowedly for my activity in striving to protect it. 
</p><p>
There was about the same time another measure, to 
which from my share in it, it may be well to advert. When 
Massachusetts and Connecticut proposed to Pennsylvania, 
the changes in the constitution, originally projected at 
the convention of <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, 1 it appeared to me after very 
deliberate examination that their inevitable effect would 
be to loosen the whole structure of the confederation, and 
that they were therefore more dangerous to the country 
than the foreign armies which threatened it. The discussion 
of these proposals had in every quarter, inflamed to their 
utmost violence the feelings of the community. I thought 
then that Pennsylvania, neutral in its position, yet em 
bracing nearly all the interests on which these changes would operate, might usefully interpose its calm strength 
between the passions of its neighbours, and by a course of 
mingled decision and gentleness, reclaim them to milder 
feelings towards each other. The report on the amendments 
was hastily drawn in the midst of other occupations, and 
much of it written on the road to Harrisburgh. It of course 
has no pretension as to form. But if my recollection does 
not deceive me, its general tone was fair and impartial, 
it imputed no unworthy motives, it contained no phrase 
which could wound even any member of that convention, 
it discussed the proposals with candor, nor was there the 
slightest departure from that courtesy, which among in 
dependent states, is at once the proof and the security of 
mutual respect. Yet this paper it seems has been the subject or the pretext of much censure upon its author. 
</p><p>
Of all these things I have never complained. I do not now complain. Their singularity has much oftener tempted 
me to smile at finding myself reproached not by the men 
of the country, for calling them from their homes, but 
by the men of the city, because in suddenly raising nine 
thousand soldiers for its defence, I had been guilty of arranging them into classes of twenty-two. It is right how 
ever, to say that if during the war I persevered in these 
measures in opposition to prejudices, which I saw were 
estranging from me many honest and amiable citizens, and 
if I have suffered nearly six years to pass without any effort 
to remove them, my silence has proceeded rather from a 
disregard of what was merely personal to myself, than from 
any insensibility to the good will of the community. I do 
not feel and I will not affect any such indifference. I have 
lived long enough to know that the kindly feelings of those who surround us, are among our best and safest enjoyments. 
But even that good will may be too dearly purchased, and 
I am quite sure that the applause of others, could never 
console me for the loss of my own esteem. That I should 
have forfeited irretrievably, if at a season of great national 
disaster, when not merely the safety, but the honor of the 
state was menaced, when all the free institutions of this 
country were rocking to their foundations, I should from 
any spirit of faction, or the despicable dread of being what 
is called unpopular, have shrunk from any one duty of the 
station in which your confidence had placed me.
