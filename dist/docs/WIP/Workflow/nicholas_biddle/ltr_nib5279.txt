My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . The Bank does not mean to commence any systematic reduction of its loans with a view to winding up its 
affairs. It does not mean to begin to close its concerns. It means to go on in its general business just as if no such event 
as the President's negative had ever happened. The only alteration it proposes is rather in the form than in the amount 
of its loans an alteration which under any circumstances, it would be disposed to recommend and it is this to give 
gently and gradually the loans of the Bank the direction of domestic bills, converting where it can be done the line of 
notes discounted, into domestic bills of exchange, which being payable at maturity, will give the Institution a greater command over its funds. . . .
