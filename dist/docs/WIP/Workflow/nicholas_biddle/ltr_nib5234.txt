My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
... I intended when I saw you to ask you to procure 
for me some information. The Office at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> had 
got into a very bad way and great losses will be sustained there. In order however to repair them as much as possible 
we placed at the head of it Mr. Jeremiah Mason, who has been very busy and very useful in securing our old bad debts and 
preventing new ones. This operation you know, is not a pleas 
ant one &amp; has raised against Mr Mason a number of enemies who complain loudly. Such complaints are generally ill 
founded, &amp; we are disposed to receive them with great distrust. At the same time it is proper not to disregard them 
and I should like to know from an authentic source whether there is any foundation for them. . . .
