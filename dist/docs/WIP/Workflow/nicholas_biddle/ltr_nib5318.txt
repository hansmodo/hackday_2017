My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 
29th ult, and rejoice to see in it the same vigor of mind &amp; of 
style which I have admired for five &amp; twenty years. I hope 
it may carry you through many Presidential Olympiads. 
</p><p>
1 The Van Buren MSS. in the Library of Congress show clearly that Van Buren 
thought he ought to follow in the footsteps of President Jackson. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your approbation of my public conduct, 
which, whatever may be the result, has been dictated by a 
very honest desire to protect the great interests of the country. 
</p><p>
In relation to the friendly suggestion which forms the pur 
pose of your letter, I have received from various quarters 
intimations of a disposition to connect my name with the 
next election of President. These I have never considered 
seriously, nor indeed noticed at all : but to you I will speak 
for the first time &amp; without reserve. 
</p><p>
I believe that the prosperity &amp; the character of the country 
require that those who now govern it should be removed and 
that all true men should unite to expel them each taking 
the position, either of chief or subaltern, which the general 
voice assigns to him. I am quite sure that I have not the 
least affectation in saying, that to myself personally, the office 
has not the slightest attraction. Its dignity has been degraded 
by the elevation to it of unworthy men and as to mere 
power, I have been for years in the daily exercise of more 
personal authority than any President habitually enjoys. But 
I stand ready for the country's service. If therefore you think 
that my name can be productive of good, I am content to 
place it as I now do, at your disposal under a conviction 
of the friendly &amp; discreet manner in which alone it will be 
employed. 
</p>
