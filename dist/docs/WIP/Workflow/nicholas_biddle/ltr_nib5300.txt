Dear sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 5th inst. and shall answer it cheerfully. And yet it is difficult 
to answer with certainty. The question you propose is "will relief be afforded to the country by a restoration of the deposits to the B.U.S. and of harmony between it and the Treasury, and this unconnected with the question of the recharter." Now the mere deposit of accruing revenue in the 
Bank would not of itself justify any immediate expansion of 
the loans, unless taken as an evidence of a change of opinions 
or of feelings toward the Bank on the part of those who govern at Washington. If there was a cordiality there if there 
was merely a concession of the deliberate efforts to destroy the Bank which has been made for several years past, the Bank might be disposed to venture much to produce relief At the same time the question of real and permanent stability to the currency is in fact the question of the recharter of 
the Bank and I am satisfied that any thing short of this can produce only partial and temporary effects. I wish that 
something were done soon, for before long the evils will grow 
entirely beyond our control. For five or six months past the 
Bank has been exerting itself to save Individuals and the 
State Banks, and but for its interposition the evils would 
have fallen upon the country with ten fold severity. These 
efforts however have a natural end and then, when the several hundred State Banks are left to themselves, the confusion will before long [be] irretrievable. This Bank is now 
very strong and shall be kept so it must be beyond the reach of any possible risk, so as to interpose hereafter when 
the confusion is no longer sufferable. Till then it must retain a position of calm and quiet strength and look on 
anxiously but immovably. It will before long have in its vaults nearly one dollar in specie for every dollar of its notes in circulation. 
</p><p>
My impressions then are these: 
</p><p>
If the Bank Charter were renewed or prolonged I believe the pecuniary difficulties of the country would be immediately healed. 
</p><p>
If the deposits were restored and the Bank had a reasonable prospect of not being obliged to draw in its loans 
soon after it had made them, I think the Bank would make an effort to relieve the country, and with the Executive friendly or not hostile, would I think succeed in the attempt. 
</p><p>
If the deposits were merely restored and the Executive continues its efforts to destroy the Bank the institution 
could not either safely or wisely change its present system, which is that of a gentle reduction preparatory to closing its concerns. 
</p><p>
You will see in the frankness of these expressions the evidence of my confidence in your discretion and my expectation that you will consider them as for yourself alone
