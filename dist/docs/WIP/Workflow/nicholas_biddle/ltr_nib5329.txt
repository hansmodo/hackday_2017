My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
We received yesterday your letter of the 5th ulto. I am not surprized that the echo in London of all the trash circulated here has annoyed you. But we have surmounted them 
on this side and I think the Bank stands even better now 
than it ever did in the general estimation. You will have seen 
that we hailed the first glimpse of sunshine offered by the 
repeal of the Specie Circular. But as soon as it passed, the 
party of the Administration rallied upon the Sub Treasury 
Bill. That bill, as you know, passed the Senate, but is now 
in such a position in the House that it cannot be reached with 
out a vote of two thirds. Accordingly Mr Cambreling has 
brought in a fresh bill which a majority can control, &amp; which 
the Administration mean to push thro the House. If this be 
the case, it will undo all that has hitherto been done. <a href='/results.php?tla=jse' rel='colleague'>Mr Sergeant</a> is here on a visit, and he thinks the matter so critical, 
&amp; is so anxious to obtain even a single vote that we are about 
sending down some people to Washington to explain to the 
representatives from our State how extremely injurious to its 
interests such a bill would prove, and urging them to defeat 
it. With what success a week will determine. ...
