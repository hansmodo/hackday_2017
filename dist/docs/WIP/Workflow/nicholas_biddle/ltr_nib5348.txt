My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Knowing how anxious you are [to] serve the country it strikes me that you might be useful now. 
</p><p>
I look with infinite regret at the prospect of a separation between <a href='/results.php?tla=jot' rel='colleague'>Mr Tyler</a> &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a>. I think <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> is not 
disinclined to stay if he were made to stay, &amp; he ought to be made to stay. I believe moreover that all the expectations 
ascribed I trust unjustly to <a href='/results.php?tla=jot' rel='colleague'>Mr Tyler</a> of making the democratic party his party are wholly fallacious. No matter who 
thinks so such a belief will only mislead him. His patronage has not yet made him a single friend. No. He must take his 
own course make his own party of the best men of the country but not seek to win over any existing class of 
politicians. He has before him a noble career if he will make an administration of his own exclusively. But if Mr W. goes 
away I think he will lose the chief strength &amp; the great ornament of his administration. 
</p><p>
He spent 24 hours here last week &amp; r seeing unbroken vigor of his understanding I could not avoid feeling it a 
public misfortune that he should be withdrawn from the public counsels. 
</p><p>
Help to prevent it if you can.
