Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... In the general views expressed in your letter I entirely concur. It is deeply to be regretted that the President 
has taken this course, and we must endeavor as much as possible to counteract its effect. But our weapons are truth and 
reason our appeal is from the passions to the understand 
ing, &amp; the dissemination of correct views of the nature &amp; operations of the Bank is the most efficient engine we can employ. 
Further than this we ought not to go. I should lament deeply that those connected with the Bank should be active or zealous or conspicuous in political contests. This would be wrong 
in itself: it is a violation of that perfect neutrality which is the first duty of the Bank. It would be injudicious too, even 
on calculation, since no advantage to be derived from their efforts would overbalance the general evil from their actual or supposed interference. . . .
