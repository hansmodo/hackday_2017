My Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
I thank you very much for your favor of the 3d: inst. with the list of names which I must prize, because I know 
that it is dictated by friendly feelings towards the Bank. As 
soon as I receive the nomination from <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a> I shall not fail to consult you about it. 
</p><p>
Since you left us, I have thought very anxiously about a subject which I mentioned to you, I mean the present disposition of the President towards the Bank. Since his opinions 
were stated in the Message, he has had an opportunity of examing more attentively the effects &amp; operations of the 
Institution, of witnessing its utility to the finances of the Government, &amp; of knowing the views of sound &amp; practical 
men from every part of the Country. He is also, I trust, satisfied that the powers of the Bank have not been abused for 
political purposes, &amp; that towards him &amp; his administration, the Bank has acted frankly, fairly &amp; cordially. It would be 
affectation in me not to say that those who conduct the 
Bank were exceedingly hurt &amp; pained by the opinion expressed by the President, that all their efforts to restore the 
Currency had failed. Yet, in the midst of their regrets, they knew too well their duties to suffer themselves to give the 
slightest political bias to the Bank, to be driven or tempted into opposition, or to abate in the slightest degree their zeal 
for the public service. The President has few more decided personal or political friends than many of those who are 
concerned in the administration of the Bank. To them, as well as to a large body of citizens, it would be exceedingly 
gratifying to know the feelings of the President towards the Bank at the present moment, because some of his injudicious 
friends &amp; many of his opponents seek to make an impression that such is his rooted dislike to the Institution, that he would 
refuse his sanction to a Continuance of the Bank, were the Charter renewed by both Houses of Congress. The first class 
say this because they dislike the Bank the second because they dislike the President; but I hope that neither the President nor the Bank will allow themselves to misunderstand 
each other, or to be estranged from each other, by the manoeuvres or the indiscretions of their respective friends or 
enemies. Their true attitude is that of mutual Independence &amp; mutual respect, &amp; as far as I am concerned that attitude 
shall be fairly maintained. 
</p><p>
Whenever you have any thing gratifying on that subject which you can with perfect propriety communicate, 
I shall be obliged by hearing it, &amp; in the mean time, remain as always 
</p>
