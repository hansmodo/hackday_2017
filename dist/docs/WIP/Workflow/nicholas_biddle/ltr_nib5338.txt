My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have little to add to what I wrote by the Royal William, of which I enclose a copy. 
</p><p>
Our arrangements with the Govt. are in very satisfactory progress. We have placed to their credit the proceeds of the 
two first bonds, and they indicate the points of disbursements, which, being very remote and numerous, afford the ad 
vantages of circulation &amp; exchange. But the greatest satis faction of all is, that this arrangement brings back the Gov't 
to its old position of doing its business thro Banks, and by means of Bank credits. So, the triumph, is, I think, complete. The two political parties, meanwhile, are confounded, 
and are not yet able to comprehend it. The Adm'n people believe that I must have bought <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr Van Buren</a>, the opposition fearing that this will strengthen the ministry and work against the interests of <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a>. You know that my owfk 
course has reference merely to the service of the Country and if these people are beaten into measures that are beneficial, I shall not permit myself to avoid co-operating with them, lest it should injure the prospects of our political party. 
The great power of the Bank lies in its total independence of all of them.

Our resumption on the 13th works very well, the demand for specie being very small.
