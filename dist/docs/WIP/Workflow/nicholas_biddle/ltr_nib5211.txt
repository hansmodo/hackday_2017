Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I again observe with pleasure your proceedings of 
yesterday. Everything will go as we could wish if we have 
but the firmness to withstand the solicitations of persons 
whose wants or whose interest overcome every other consideration. Our first duty is to take care of the Bank, and 
at the present moment of wild and exaggerated speculation if we suffer ourselves to be borne away by the cur 
rent, if we do not on the contrary, like sober and prudent 
men, resist alike the entreaties or the clamors of individuals 
we shall betray our trust. You are doing now perfectly well. 
Let us not by the hope of doing better or getting more business risk the prosperity and safety of the institution. . . . 
</p>
