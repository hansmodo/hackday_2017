Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... In respect to the other subject of your letter, you 
will I think readily understand the position of the Bank. Believing as we do that the whole support of the currency must 
devolve on the B.U.S. and seeing as we think we do, that the disorders and troubles are but beginning, our great effort 
is to make the Bank not merely strong, but entirely beyond 
the reach of those who, under the name of the Gov. are 
seeking its destruction In this operation the State Banks 
fall in debt. Now we must either settle with these Banks or 
let the debt increase till it may grow entirely beyond our 
control and beyond their means of payment. This is wrong 
in two respects first, because it is not just to the Stock 
holders of the B.U.S. to give to others the gratuitous use of 
so large a portion of their capital and second because 
these large balances may become unsafe. For example, the 
Banks of the City of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> owe to the Branch Bank 
$700,000. Why should they be allowed to owe that sum? 
and what will become of the debt if it be permitted to in 
crease as it probably will to twice that sum? I believe that 
the State Banks themselves will be benefitted by the restraint of being obliged to settle and so accommodate their business to their means. The Bank, as I am sure you are 
aware, is desirous of protecting the community from the 
mischief which threaten it, and has been constantly engaged 
in relieving the Banks and individuals whose solvency has 
been endangered by the measures of the Treasury. At the 
same time the Bank would injure itself &amp; not benefit the 
country, if, after all the warnings which the State Banks as 
well as individuals have had to diminish their business and provide against the storm, it should venture on the Quixotjsni of preventing all inconvenience to the public from the 
measures intended to destroy the Institution. The course wmch circumstances seem to force upon the Bank is that of 
gradual &amp; gentle diminition of its business, so as to be pre 
pared to expand or to close its affairs as the country may de 
sire hereafter. I pray you to believe that I shall always be 
happy to hear from you and that I am
