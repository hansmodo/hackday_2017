My dear sir 
</p><p>
I received this morning your letter of the 9th &amp; read 
with great interest all its details. You and our friend Mr Chauncey now understand so well the whole ground that 
I shall join you in any opinion which you may ultimately 
adopt. Let us go for the practical. If we can get a permanent 
charter, let us do so if not, let us take the temporary &amp; 
make it permanent hereafter. Above all, let us do something 
soon. The country now wants something to rally to it re 
quires some point on which to concentrate its thoughts. In 
the present fusion of opinions, a stamp may be impressed, 
which will hereafter be more difficult as men's minds cool. 
</p><p>
I go tomorrow to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to see into the real state of 
things.
