Dear Sir 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 16th is duly received &amp; the contents are extremely satisfactory. I was sure that the statement was 
a calumny, &amp; am glad that we have it in our power to prove it so. 
</p><p>
I have heard various accounts of Mr. Blairs connection with the Office, such as his being indebted &amp; settling his ac 
count by paying ten per cent of the principal, immediately previous to his leaving <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a> to establish himself at 
Washington. Have the goodness to let me know the particulars of that transaction.
