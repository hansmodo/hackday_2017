Dear Sir 
</p><p>
Mr Kimble of the House of Representatives called upon me today and expressed to me a wish on your part to 
know whether the bonds of the Bank could be made available for the use of your Department. I hasten to say that from a 
desire to promote the public service, as well as from considerations personal to yourself, it will afford me great pleasure 
to do anything which may contribute to the successful ad ministration of your Department. 
</p><p>
There are, as you are aware, three bonds payable on the 1st of October of <a href='/results.php?year=1838'>1838</a>-39 &amp; 40, respectively. The two which it 
is proposed to sell cannot be sold either in this country or in 
Europe, and the money can be furnished for them by the Bank only. But I should be disposed to advance the money 
on the first, second, and perhaps third of them, if it could be made the interest of both the Department and the Bank. 
If therefore you can in the first instance so arrange it as to have the bonds placed at your disposition to raise the money 
on them, and let me know how and where and when your disbursements are to be made, I will at once tell you what I can do. 
</p>
