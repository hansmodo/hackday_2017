My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I yesterday wrote a hasty letter explaining my views in regard to the modifications suggested of the Charter of the 
Bank. In addition to what was then said of the disposition of the Bank, to acquiesce in any modification which may 
protect the rights of the States from any encroachment by the Bank I will now add that if the President wishes to 
stipulate that no new Branch shall be established without demeanour and vivacity of speech, added to great powers of work, and acuteness 
in detecting the foibles of others, made him a formidable opponent. Further, his 
marriage with the sister of Bischoffswerder, until lately the King's favourite adviser, added to his influence, which, as was natural with a foreigner, inclined 
toward the attractive and gainful course. Long afterwards the saviour of Prussia, 
Baron von Stein, classed him among the narrow, selfish, insincere men who had 
been the ruin of nations." Cf. Rose, J. H., William Pitt and the Great War (Lon 
don, <a href='/results.php?year=1912'>1912</a>), p. 203; also cf. Seeley, Stein, vol. I, p. 65.

From Charles Jared Ingersoll 1 8 7 
</p><p>
the assent of the State in which it is proposed to locate it, 
I think there would be no objection to it on the part of the 
Bank 
</p><p>
In truth I believe there is no change desired by the Presi 
dent which would not be immediately assented to by the 
Bank. And this it is which gives me so much regret, to find 
the President &amp; the Bank apparently estranged while there 
is really no difference between them, and to see the Presidents 
friends lose the present opportunity of settling the question 
so well, &amp; so advantageously for him.
