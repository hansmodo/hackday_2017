Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I send by this mail <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr. Webster</a>s speech on the Veto Message, and also another article reviewing that message. It 
is desirable that these should be circulated so as to counter 
act the injurious impressions which the message was destined 
to make against the Institution. You will therefore cause the 
papers, as well as <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr. Clay's</a> &amp; Mr. Ewing's speeches on the 
same subject or any other well written articles in regard to 
the Bank to be printed and dispersed. If you think any of 
these I have mentioned too long or elaborate for general reading, you can substitute any other matter which may have the same object. All that I wish to caution you against is, that abstaining as the Bank does from all connexion with 
what are called party politics, you will confine your efforts exclusively to the distribution of what may be explanatory 
of the operations and conduct of the Bank. Confined to that 
object exclusively, you may cause to be printed and circulated any amount of such papers as you may consider necessary for the vindication of the Bank and give me an account 
of the expense, which you will of course endeavor to make as reasonable as may consist with the object in view.
