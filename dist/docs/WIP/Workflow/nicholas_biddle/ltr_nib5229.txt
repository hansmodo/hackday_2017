Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 2d inst, in which you mention your being about to make 
a favorable report on the nomination of Directors of the B. U. S, but wished previously to know "what amount of 
accommodation had been granted to each by way of discount." I feel some regret at declining to answer any inquiry 
of yours and as you know have given full &amp; frank in formation on every topic connected with the administration 
of the Bank. But a question involving the private affairs of my colleagues is of a totally different character. The account 
which any individual keeps with the Bank is a private con 
cern between him &amp; the Bank of which it would be a violation of confidence to speak. The information sought more 
over would be useless unless its tendency was to show that the individual had borrowed too much a fact which would 
tend to prove not merely the want of personal independence 
on the part of the borrower, but also fix on the Board of Directors the imputation of suffering him to borrow too much 
to neither of which could I with propriety give countenance without a departure from that course of delicacy in 
regard to the private concerns of individuals which I think due equally to them &amp; to myself. My feeling on that subject 
is very strong. I have for instance been a director of the Bank for nine years I have been its presiding officer for six years. 
I have never borrowed a dollar from the Bank x &amp; trust that I never shall. And yet if it were made a question whether I 
had borrowed one dollar or one million of dollars I would not answer the enquiry, to be made President of the U.S. be 
cause it goes to establish an inquisition into the private affairs of individuals which is equally unjust &amp; invidious. I do 
not think myself at liberty therefore to state any thing with regard to those who keep their accounts in the Bank. . . . 
</p><p>
P.S. We have just made a dividend of 3^ per cent with a surplus on our last six months business of more than $100,000 
so that the operations of the year close with a dividend of 7 per cent &amp; a surplus of profits of $224,000.
