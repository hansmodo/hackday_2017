Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I received yesterday your favor of the 27th inst which was forthwith disposed of as requested. 
</p><p>
On the subject of aid from this quarter the fact is, I under 
stand, that the contributions fall on a very narrow circle of 
not wealthy people and that on the late occasion they have 
been completely exhausted and a little dispirited that their 
exertions have proved so little productive in proportion to 
their expectations. I should not think it at all probable that 
any thing further could be obtained from them. As to the 
Bank itself, I have always made it a point of duty never to 
permit its interference in any manner with our political concerns. It was a refusal to become partizans to the present set in J 
power which has made them its enemies, and it will persevere " 
in the same neutrality to the end altho all the temptations 
to depart from that course are obvious &amp; strong, &amp; however 
much the consequences may be deplored of the present misrule. We shall not look with less anxiety however on your 
great struggle, on which the fate of the country now in a great degree depends. With the hope that you and the 
good cause you support may triumph in that struggle, I remain 
</p>
