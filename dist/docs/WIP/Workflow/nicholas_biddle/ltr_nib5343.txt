My dear Sir 
</p><p>
... 2. I have received a visit of many hours from a 
friend who has just returned after passing several weeks in the midst of the most confidential circle of the President 
Elect and his friends a disinterested cool observer and I 
have no doubt of the truth of his observations. He says decidedly that in the opinion of all that circle Mr W. is the 
person who will have much more influence with the President than Mr. C 
</p><p>
4. My friend came full of another idea. He says that the 
same knot are of great friends of mine that the President 
himself when lately at <a href='/results.php?city=louisville' rel='city'>Louisville</a> made a very strong &amp; decided eulogium upon me, and that this circle of friends believe that he wishes me to go into the Treasury. When I told 
him my determination on that head, he concluded with this 
declaration Well I assure you, you can make the Secretary 
"of the Treasury." Now I would not go into the Treasury 
for all the money in it but if I could help to put a good man 
there I would do so. But where is the man ? If in this turmoil 
of Pennsylvania candidates, the President wants to get over 
a difficulty by naming a Penn a man &amp; wishes to name me I will refuse by return mail, and then we can find some competent person. I mention this, that you may understand exactly the footing on which Mr. H and I are . . .
