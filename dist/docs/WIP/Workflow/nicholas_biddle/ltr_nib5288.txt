Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . There is at this moment a strange scene before 
our eyes here. Mr. Duane, after much solicitation and with an 
unaffected hesitation accepted the place of Secretary but 
he took it entirely untrammelled &amp; unpledged. He had been a 
little time in Office when he was required to concurr in the schemes of Jackson and the Kitchen Cabinet against the 
Bank by withdrawing the deposits. This he refused. A mission has accordingly been set on foot to make arrangements 
with the State Banks to do the duties now performed by the Bank of the U.S. so as to deprive Mr. Duane of the objection 
that the change would incommode the public business. Of this mission Amos Kendall is the plenipotentiary, and he is 
expected here to-day. If he succeeds the attack will be resumed on Mr. Duane. But that gentleman will I am satisfied 
refuse, as he has already done. He will take a decided, firm, manly stand, and will leave his place rather than prostitute 
it. This will introduce a new state of things. The Kitchen 
Cabinet is already against Mr. Duane &amp; will endeavor to expel him but if he is only firm as I rely on his being, he may 
I do much to break up this nest of gamblers. The result will be soon known. In the mean time I think we may be sure that 
Mr. Duane will be in flagrant opposition to the Kitchen Cabinet, that he has already refused, and will continue to refuse to yield to them. . . .
