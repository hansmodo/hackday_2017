My dear Sir 
</p><p>
You ask my views about the mode in which the Bank 
of the U.S. could assist in restoring the currency. I will tell 
you in a few words. 
</p><p>
The present design of those who govern the Government 
at Washington is, I understand, to draw all the funds out of 
the Banks then cut all connection with them and establish subtreasuries where each receiver is to sit upon his 
small heap of gold &amp; silver. This is the newest, &amp; therefore 
the favorite, foolery. Congress, I think will not agree to this, 
or to any other experiment and will incline to either a real 
downright Bank of the U.S. chartered by the Genl Gov or to 
the present Pennsylv 3 . Bank. . . . 
</p><p>
If the Treasury &amp; the Bank could come to an understand 
ing as to the terms on which the Bank would do this business 
everything would soon come right. 
</p><p>
But I can do nothing at present which would not work 
more harm than good. This very proposition I made before 
the suspension. Had it been adopted the Suspension would 
have been I believe, averted. I cannot now renew it. My 
purpose now is to be perfectly quiet to be ready but 
not impatient &amp; wait the action of Congress. If that body 
adopts any measure which promises relief I shall cordially 
concur in it If not, having done my duty I remain wl 
I was. My great object is to heal the wounds inflicted upon the country. I will spare no effort for that purpose. No misguided feeling of pride, no remembrance of past injustice to myself shall prevent me from a sincere &amp; cordial cooperation with any public men who will honestly labor in the public service. These are the simple views and the frank opinion of 
</p>
