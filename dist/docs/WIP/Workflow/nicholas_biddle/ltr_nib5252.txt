Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . What I can do &amp; will do is this. It is obvious that 
a great effort will be made to array the influence of the Executive &amp; all his party against the Bank. It is not less evident 
that our most effectual resistance is the dissemination of useful knowledge among the people, and accordingly I am 
endeavoring to convey to all classes real &amp; positive information in regard to the working of the institution &amp; its beneficial influence on the prosperity of the nation. To do this 
newspapers must be used, not for their influence, but merely as channels of communication with the people. If you think 
the one in question a useful vehicle of information I will employ it and in this way. 
</p><p>
I have many articles about the Bank articles of interest to a general reader &amp; which would occupy no more space 
than would be necessarily given to articles on other topics, nor occasion I presume any extra expence such for in 
stance as <a href='/results.php?tla=gmd' rel='colleague'>Mr. McDuffie's</a> &amp; Smith's reports or the extracts 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=alg' rel='colleague'>Mr Gallatin's</a> article. For the insertion of these I will pay either as they appear or in advance. Thus for instance if 
you will cause the articles I have indicated and others which I may prepare to be inserted in the newspaper in question, I 
will at once pay to you one thousand dollars. If this may facilitate the arrangement you propose I shall be glad. There 
is as you perceive nothing in this communication which I should care to conceal, but as it might be misconstrued, I 
inclose your letter to me &amp; request that you will have the goodness to return what I have written to you. It will give 
me great pleasure to see you on the 15th , and in the mean time I am with sincere regard &amp; many thanks for your presenting 
the subject to me. 
</p>
