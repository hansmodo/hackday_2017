Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I received last evening your favor of the 6th inst. The 
course of the Gov. being I presume settled as according to 
the newspapers, it now remains only to do what we can to 
diminish the sufferings of the country, and for this I shall 
certainly work as hard as if I had caused them. 
</p><p>
You ask whether some plan could not be devised by which 
the issues of the banks &amp; the exchanges could be regulated 
as formerly, by a connection with some large state Bank. I 
have no doubt of it. I have no doubt that at this moment the 
simplest &amp; easiest form of relief would be to make the pres 
ent Bank of the U.S. the depositors of the public revenue. 
It would be only necessary 
</p><p>
1st . To let the Treasury &amp; the Bank agree that the Bank 
should take charge of the public revenue collect and dis 
tribute it relieve the Treasury from all trouble about it. 
</p><p>
2d . To let the Treasury without disturbing or formally 
repealing the specie circular 1 direct the receivers to take 
the notes of the Bank of the U.S. 
</p><p>
3d . The Bank would then appoint its own agents or 
affiliate with it other State Banks being of course responsible for them all &amp; the whole system of the public revenue 
as it was in <a href='/results.php?year=1830'>1830</a> which, now we may speak of it historically, was an admirable one would be all restored. 
</p><p>
The Western State Banks have mostly officers of the late 
Bank the whole country asks nothing better than its notes 
which are now every where at a premium, and both at home 
&amp; abroad the Bank has a reputation which it can put at the \ 
service of the Government. 
</p><p>
I sincerely believe that in a week's time such an arrangement would restore confidence &amp; credit. 
</p><p>
The very prospect of it would stop many of the evils which 
are impending. 
</p><p>
And why should it not be? If the thing promises well, why 
should we be deterred from attempting it? Why should <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr Van Buren</a> &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=jof' rel='colleague'>Mr Forsyth</a> &amp; Mr Dickerson &amp; Mr Woodbury 
&amp; yourself not agree to any project which promises relief, 
even tho the name of the Bank be connected with it. I am 
sure you are all above the indulgence of any feeling on that 
score and for myself, I am perfectly willing to forget all 
the quarrels with the last administration, which neither party 
would desire to have perpetuated. 
</p><p>
Politically the effect would undoubtedly be good. Pennsylvania would be pleased, and the whole country would regard it as a proof of returning peace. 
</p><p>
It would require a little time to mount again the machinery, 
but it could be done without much delay, &amp; in the mean time 
the very knowledge that it was intended, would be infinitely 
soothing in the present initated condition of things. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear sir, there is a project for you. If you can bring 
it to bear, you will have done great good to the country a 
work in which you will always find a ready cooperation. 
</p>
