My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
The frequent experience which we have had of your 
liberality and your attachment to the interest of the Bank, 
has induced us to take a liberty which I persuade myself 
you will not disapprove. Since the Presidency of the Office 
at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> has passed out of the political family where it has 
been so long, there has been a feeling of disquiet at the circumstance, increased by the political cast of a great majority of the Board. These are considerations, which situated as we are we cannot wholly overlook, that they shall 
never be permitted to interfere with more important matters. Still in the effort to attract towards the Bank the good wishes of the country at large it is desirable whenever a 
safe opportunity presents itself, of assuaging feelings which 
may hereafter grow into hostility, to take advantage of it. 
During the present year our two directors from your state 
are both of the same political denomination and as the 
President of the Office is now of that section also it is 
thought well to give to their political opponents, if indeed 
they can be so called, a larger share in the administration. 
This we have done by substituting <a href='/results.php?tla=bwc' rel='colleague'>Mr Crowninshield</a>, for Mr. Mason. To the latter's gentleman his seat at this 
Board is I presume an object of indifference, as his high stand 
ing and character place him beyond the reach of wishing a 
mere compliment, and his occupations prevent his personal 
attendance. <a href='/results.php?tla=bwc' rel='colleague'>Mr Crowninshield</a> is a gentleman of character, 
a large Stockholder, and he will now visit us necessarily 
twice a year. Under these circumstances, <a href='/results.php?tla=tmc' rel='colleague'>Gen'l Cadwalader</a> and myself have thought it was for the interest of 
the Bank to make the change, and we have relied on the 
good feelings of yourself and Mr Mason to understand, and 
appreciate our motives. To that gentleman, whom I have 
not the pleasure of knowing personally, I trust you will be 
good enough to explain the reasons of this change, which in truth has been occasioned by our perfect conviction, that 
in the endeavor to reconcile conflicting interests we have 
some right to claim and are sure of receiving, the indulgence of such gentlemen as Mr Mason and yourself.
