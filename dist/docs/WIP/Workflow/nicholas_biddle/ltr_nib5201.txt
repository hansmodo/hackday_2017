D' Sir

It is so long since I have had the pleasure of hearing from you that I take the liberty of asking news of yourself 
&amp; the family. I should indeed before this have acknowledged your kind letter, but there is you know a tranquil, one might 
say a happy uniformity which gives to American life but little variety of incidents, &amp; it would be superfluous I trust 
to repeat the assurances of my respect &amp; esteem. My young friend Mr Walsh whom you may recollect in London has just returned in the Pacific. With regard to our affairs, he 
left Mr Pinkney under a strong impression that the modification of the Orders in Council was all that England meant 
to concede to this country. He had no idea of the more enlarged arrangement which has been made, or is expected at 
Washington. It seems singular that whilst negociating in London the ulterior views of the British government should 
have been concealed from him, &amp; it would be unfortunate 
if in a matter of such consequence there should be any misapprehension. But the declaration of Mr Erskine appear[s] 
full &amp; explicit. Mr M's observation of the pressure of the embargo rather confirms the opinion that we have only 
revealed the dangerous secret of our impotence yet the experiment tho dear may perhaps be valuable, since nations 
like men should learn to estimate their comparative value. All England is so much occupied with the Duke of York 
that this new war in Austria has attracted very little attention, &amp; excited no expectation of success. Lord Holland still 
remains in Spain. <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel=''>Mr Burr</a> was ordered to leave England, not as was stated at the requisition of the Spanish minister but 
from a belief that he was travelling over England for the purpose of collecting information which might render him after 
wards acceptable to the French gov't . He had been at Edinburgh &amp; the gov't understanding his intention of going to Ireland sent orders there to prevent his landing. . . .
