</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 14th ult., and also the 
book on Plaster of Paris, which you was so obliging as to 
send me, and for which accept my thanks. 
</p><p>
Your letter conveyed to me the first and only information I have received, that a copy of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a>'s 
valedictory address had been found among the papers of 
General Hamilton, and in his handwriting; and that a certain gentleman had also a copy of it in the same handwriting. 
</p><p>
This intelligence is unpleasant and unexpected. Had 
the address been one of those official papers which, in the 
course of affairs, the secretary of the proper department 
might have prepared, and the president have signed, these 
facts would have been unimportant ; but it was a personal 
act — of choice, not of official duty — and it was so connected with other obvious considerations, as that he only 
could with propriety write it. In my opinion, President 
Washington must have been sensible of this propriety, and 
therefore strong evidence would be necessary to make me 
believe that he violated it. Whether he did or did not, is a 
question which naturally directs our attention to whatever 
affords presumptive evidence respecting it ; and leads the 
mind into a long train of correspondent reflections. I will 
give you a summary of those which have occurred to me ; 
not because I think them necessary to settle the point in 
question, for the sequel will show that they arc not, but 
because the occasion invites me to take the pleasure of reviewing and bearing testimony to the merits of our departed 
friend. 
</p><p>
Is it to be presumed from these facts, that General Hamilton was the real, and the president only the reputed author 
of that address ? Although they countenance such a presumption, yet I think its foundation will be found too slight 
and shallow to resist that strong and full stream of counter 
evidence, which flows from ,the conduct and character of 
that great man. A character not blown up into transient 
splendour by the breath of adulation, but, being compos< d 
of his great and memorable deeds, stands, and will forever 
stand, a glorious monument of human excellence 
</p><p>
So prone, however, is "poor human nature" to dislike 
and depreciate the superiority of contemporaries, that 
when these facts come to be generally known (and generally known they will be) many, with affected regret and 
hesitation, will infer and hint, that Washington had less 
greatness of talent, and less greatness of mind, than his 
friends and admirers ascribed to him. Nor will the number 
of those be few, who, from personal or party inducements, 
will artfully encourage and diligently endeavour to give 
currency to such imputations. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, there are men of candour and judgment 
(and time will increase their number) who, aiming only at 
truth, will cheerfully trace and follow its footsteps, and on 
finding, gladly embrace it. Urged by this laudable motive, they will attentively examine the history of his life ; 
and in it they will meet with such numerous proofs of his 
knowledge and experience of men and things in general, 
and of our national affairs in particular, as to silence all 
doubts of his ability to conceive and express every idea in 
that address. A careful perusal of that history will convince them, that the principles of policy which it recommends as rules for the conduct of others, are precisely those 
by which he regulated his own. 
</p><p>
There have been in the world but two systems or schools 
of policy ; the one founded on the great principles of wisdom and rectitude, the other on cunning and its various 
artifices. To the first of these belonged Washington and 
all the other worthies of every country, who ascended to 
the temple of honour through the temple of virtue. The 
doctrines, maxims, and precepts of this school, have been 
explained and inculcated by the ablest writers, ancient and 
modern. In all civilized countries they are known, though 
often neglected ; and in free states have always been publicly commended and taught. They crossed the Atlantic 
with our forefathers ; and in our days particularly, have 
not only engaged the time and attention of students, but 
have been constantly and eloquently displayed by able men 
in our senates and assemblies. What reason can there be 
to suppose that Washington did not understand these subjects ? If it be asked, what these subjects comprehend or 
relate to ? the answer is this, They relate to the nature and 
duties of man — to his propensities and passions — his virtues and vices — his habits and prejudices — his real and 
relative wants and enjoyments — his capacities for social 
and national happiness — and the means by which, according to time, place, and other existing circumstances, it is, 
in a greater or less degree, to be procured, preserved, or 
increased. From a profound investigation of these subjects, enlightened by experience, result all that knowledge 
and those maxims and precepts of sound policy, which 
enable legislators and rulers to manage and govern public 
affairs wisely and justly. 
</p><p>
By what other means than the practical use of this knowledge, could Washington have been able to lead and govern 
an army, hastily collected from various parts, and who 
brought with them to the field all the license and all the 
habits which they had indulged at home ? Could he, by 
the force of orders and proclamations, have constrained 
them to render him that obedience, confidence, and warm 
attachment which he soon acquired, and which, throughout 
all vicissitudes and distresses, continued constant and undiminished to the last ? By what other means could he 
have been able to frustrate the designs of dark cabals, and 
the unceasing intrigues of envious competitors, and the arts 
of the opposing enemy ? By what other means could he 
have been able, in so masterly a manner, to meet and manage all those perplexing embarrassments which the revolutionary substitution of a new government — which the 
want of that power in Congress which they had not, and 
of that promptitude which no deliberative body can have — 
which the frequent destitution, and constant uncertainty of 
essential supplies — which the incompetency of individuals, 
on whom much depended, the perfidy of others, and the 
mismanagement of many, could not fail to engender. 
We know, and history will inform posterity, that from the 
first of his military career, he had to meet and encounter, and 
surmount a rapid succession of formidable difficulties, even 
down to the time when his country was enabled, by the 
success of their arms, to obtain the honourable peace which 
terminated the war. His high and appointed course being 
then finished, he disdained the intimations of lawless ambition to prolong it. He disbanded the army under circumstances which required no common degree of policy or virtue ; and with universal admiration and plaudits, descended 
joyfully and serenely into the shades of retirement. They 
who ascribe all this to the guidance and protection of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, do well ; but let them recollect, that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
seldom interposes in human affairs, but through the agency 
of human means. 
</p><p>
"When, at a subsequent and alarming period, the nation 
found that their affairs had gone into confusion, and that 
clouds, portending danger and distress, were rising over 
them from every quarter, they instituted under his auspices 
a more efficient government ; and unanimously committed 
the administration of it to him. Would they have done 
this, without the highest confidence in his political talents 
and wisdom ? Certainly not. No novice in navigation 
was ever unanimously called upon to take the helm or 
command of a ship on the point of running aground 
anions: the breakers. This universal confidence would 
have proved a universal mistake, had it not been justified 
by the event. The unanimous opinion entertained and 
declared by a whole people in favour of any fellow-citizen, 
is rarely erroneous ; especially in times of alarm and 
calamity. 
</p><p>
To delineate the course, and enumerate the measures 
which he took to arrive at success, would be to write a 
volume. The firmness and policy with winch he overcame 
the obstacles placed in his way by the derangement of 
national affairs ; by the devices of domestic demagogues, 
and of foreign agents ; as well as by the deleterious influences of the French revolution, need not be particularized. 
Our records, and histories, and memoirs render it unnt 
sary. It is sufficient to say, and it can be said with truth, 
that his administration raised the nation out of confusion 
into order; out of degradation and distress into reputation and prosperity. It found us withering — it left us 
flourishing. 
</p><p>
Is it to he believed, that after having thus led the nation 
out of a bewildered state, and guided them for many years 
from one degree of prosperity to another, he was not qualified, on retiring, to advise them how to proceed and go on? 
And what but this is the object and the burden of his valedictory address ? He was persuaded that, as the national 
welfare had been recovered and established, so it could only 
be preserved and prolonged by a continued and steady adherence to those principles of sound policy, and impartial 
justice, which had invariably directed his administration. 
Although the knowledge of them had been spread and scattered among the people, here a little, and there a little, yet, 
being desirous to mark even the last day of his public life by 
some act of public utility, he addressed and presented them 
to his fellow-citizens, in points of light so clear and strong, 
as to make deep impression on the public mind. These 
last parental admonitions of this father of his country were 
gratefully received, and universally admired. But the experience of ages informs us, that it is less difficult to give 
good advice, than to prevail on men to follow it. 
</p><p>
Such and so obvious is the force of the preceding considerations, as to render doubts of the president's ability to 
give the advice contained in the address too absurd to have 
many serious advocates. But it would not surprise me, if 
certain classical gentlemen, associating the facts you mention with the style and fashion of the address, should intimate, that his ability to compose it substantially in his 
mind, does not prove that he was also capable of communicating his advice in a paper so well written. 
</p><p>
Let those gentlemen recollect the classical maxim which 
they learned at school : 
</p><p>
" Scribendi recte, sapere est et principium et fons." 
</p><p>
They may also be referred to another classical maxim, 
which teaches us, that they who well understand their subject, will be at no loss for words : 
</p><p>
" Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur." 
</p><p>
But his ability to write well need not be proved by the 
application of maxims ; it is established by facts. We are 
told to judge of a tree by its fruit ; let us, in like manner, 
judge of his pen by its performances. 
</p><p>
Few men, who had so little leisure, have written so 
much. His public letters alone are voluminous ; and public opinion has done justice to their merits ; many of them 
have been published, and they who read them will be convinced, that at the period of the address, he had not to 
learn how to write well. But it may be remarked, that 
the address is higher finished than the letters ; and so it 
ought to be. That address was to be presented to the 
whole nation, and on no common occasion : it w T as intended 
for the present and future generations ; it was to be read 
in this country, and in foreign countries ; and to be criticised, not only by affectionate friends and impartial judges, 
but also bv envious and malignant enemies. It was an 
address which, according as it should or should not correspond with his exalted character and fame, would either 
justify or impeach the prevailing opinion of his talents and 
wisdom. Who, therefore, can wonder that he should bestow more thought, and time, and pains on that address 
than on a letter ? 
</p><p>
Although in the habit of depending ultimately on his 
own judgment, yet no man was more solicitous to obtain 
and collect light on every question and measure on which 
he had to decide. He knew that authors, like parents, are 
not among the first to discover imperfections in their 
offspring; and that consideration would naturally induce 
him to imitate the example of those ancient and modern 
writers (among whom were statesmen, generals, and even 
men of consular and royal dignity) who submitted their 
compositions to the judgment of their friends, before they 
put the last hand to them. Those friends would make 
notes of whatever defects they observed in the draught, 
and of the correspondent amendments which they deemed 
proper. If they found that the arrangement could be improved, they would advise certain transpositions ; if the 
connexion between any of the relative parts was obscure, 
they would make it more apparent; if a conclusion had 
better be left to implication than expressed, they would 
strike it out, and so vice versa; if an additional remark 
or allusion would give force or light to a sentiment or 
proposition, they would propose it ; where a sentence was 
too long, they would divide it; they would correct redundances ; change words less apt, for words more apt, &c, 
&c, &c. To correct a composition in this way, is to do 
a friendly office ; but to prepare a new one, and offer it to 
the author as a substitute for his own, would deserve a different appellation. 
</p><p>
Among those to whose judgment and candour President 
Washington would commit such an interesting and delicate 
task, where is the man to be found, who would have had 
the hardihood to say to him in substance, though in terms 
ever so nice and courtly — Sir, I have examined and considered your draught of an address : it will not do ; it is 
really good for nothing. But, sir, I have taken the trouble 
to write a proper one for you ; and I now make you a 
present of it : I advise you to adopt it, and to pass it on the 
world as your own; the cheat will never be discovered, 
for you may depend on my secrecy. Sir, I have inserted 
in it a paragraph that will give the public a good opinion 
of your modesty : I will read it to you ; it is in these 
words : 
</p><p>
" In the discharge of this trust, I will only say, that I 
have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and administration of the government, the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. 
Not unconscious, in the outset, of the inferiority of my 
qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still 
more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to 
diffidence of myself." 
</p><p>
If it be possible to find a man among those whom he 
esteemed, capable of offering to him such a present, it is 
impossible to believe that <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a> was the 
man to whom such a present would have been acceptable. 
They who knew <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a>, and his various 
endowments, qualifications, and virtues, know that, aggregately considered, they found a " tout ensemble" which has 
rarely been equalled, and perhaps never excelled. 
</p><p>
Thus much for presumptive evidence. I will now turn 
your attention to some that is direct. 
</p><p>
The history (if it may be so called) of the address is not 
unknown to me ; but as I came to the knowledge of it 
under implied confidence, I doubted, when I first received 
your letter, whether I ought to disclose it. On more 
mature reflection, I became convinced, that if President 
Washington was now alive, and informed of the facts in 
question, he would not only authorize, but also desire me 
to reduce it to writing ; that when necessary, it might 
be used to invalidate the imputations to which those facts 
give colour. This consideration terminated my doubts. I 
do not think that a disclosure is necessary at this moment, 
but I fear such a moment will arrive. Whether I shall 
then be alive, or in capacity to give testimony, is so uncertain, that in order to avoid the risk of either, I shall now 
reduce it to writing, and commit it to vour care and discretion, " de bene esse," as the lawyers say. 
</p><p>
Some time before the address appeared, Colonel (afterward General) Hamilton informed me, that he had received 
a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a>, and with it the draught 
of a farewell address, which the president had prepared. 
and on which he requested our opinion. He then proposed 
that we should fix on a day for an interview at my house 
on the subject. A day was accordingly appointed. On 
that day <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Hamilton</a> attended. He observed to me, 
in words to this effect — that, after having read and examined the draught, it appeared to him to be suscepuble of 
improvement — that he thought the easiest and best way 
was to leave the draught untouched and in its fail state; 
and to write the whole over with such amendments, alterations, and corrections as he thought were advisable; and 
that he had done so. He then proposed to read it, and to 
make it the subject of our consideration. This being agreed 
to, he read it ; and we proceeded deliberately to discuss 
and consider it, paragraph by paragraph, until the whole 
met with our mutual approbation : some amendments were 
made during the interview, but none of much importance. 
Although this business had not been hastily despatched, yet, 
aware of the consequence of such a paper, I suggested the 
giving it a further critical examination ; but he declined it, 
saying that he was pressed for time, and was anxious to 
return the draught to the president without delay. It 
afterward occurred to me, that a certain proposition was 
expressed in terms too general and unqualified, and I hinted 
it in a letter to the president. 
</p><p>
As the business took the course above mentioned, a recurrence to the draught was unnecessary, and it was not 
read. There was this advantage in the course pursued — 
the president's draught remained (as delicacy required) 
fair, and not obscured by interlineations, &c. By comparing it with the paper sent with it, he would immediately 
observe the particular emendations and corrections that 
were proposed ; and would find them standing in their intended places. Hence he was enabled to review and to 
decide on the whole matter, with much greater clearness 
and facility than if he had received them in separate and 
detached notes, and with detailed references to the pages 
and lines, where they were advised to be introduced. 
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
