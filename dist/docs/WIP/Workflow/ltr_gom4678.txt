My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr Livingston delivered to me yours of the 25th of July. 
He says that you alone gave him an idea of this country like 
the reality. His astonishment proves that he did not believe 
you, and, could you hear him, you might, in your turn, be astonished to find that your sound understanding, while it grasped the future event, had never contemplated the progressive 
circumstances. I leave to others the painful task of drawing 
pictures, which, to resemble the truth, must, like an Indian 
warrior, be painted red and black.

 It is in your character of Financier, that I transmit the 
annexed report, which suspended for a few doubtful days the 
weight which, with crushing force, falls on the monied men. 
Early in <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, I ventured to declare, from what I then observed, that the laws of property being violated, all would, in 
their turns, be sacrificed on the same altar. Already the 
Church, the Magistrature, the Nobility have passed away. 
Bankers, merchants, and manufacturers are now in the crucible. 
I leave to your algebraic science to resolve the problem of 
how long a supposed society can exist, after property shall 
have been done away. Perhaps you may be too busy to form 
equations, and may reply as a statesman, that government being instituted to protect property, is respected only in proportion to the fulfilment of that duty, and durable only as it is respectable. I respect you too much to contradict your opinions, 
and therefore confine myself to the more agreeable task of assuring you that I am, &c.
