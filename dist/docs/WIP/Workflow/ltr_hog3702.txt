Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your letter of the 12th 
instant, declaring to me that no charge having been 
brought against me before your Excellency, the Court 
of Inquiry into my conduct could proceed upon no 
other principle, in the military way, than the resolve 
of Congress, of the 5th of October last. Having been 
informed that Congress had no charge against me, I 
transmitted to them, by the President, your Excellency's last letter. Their inclosed resolve is the result; 
and I conceive that your intention, pointed as it was, 
has been mistaken.''' 
</p><p>
This evening, I wrote to his Excellency the President, that " before our disaster at Camden, had a resolve of Congress ordered that every Commanding 
Officer, who shall not beat the enemy, must be recalled, and subjected to a Court of Inquiry, whether 
</p><p>
" October 5th, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. Resolved, that the Commander-in-chief be, and 
hereby is directed to order a Court of Inquiry to be held on the conduct of Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a>, as Commander of the Southern army. 
</p><p>
" Resolved, that the Commander-in-chief be, and hereby is directed 
to appoint an officer to command the Southern array, in the room of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a>, until such inquiry be made." 
</p><p>
"May 21, <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>. Resolved, that the resolutions of the 5th of October 
last, directing a Court of Inquiiy to be held on the conduct of Major<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a>, as Commander of the Southern army, and directing the 
Commander-in-chief to appoint an officer to command the Southern army, in the room of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a>, until such inquiry be made, did not 
operate as a suspension of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a> from his command in the Une of the army at lai-ge, as a Major-General ; and as, from the situation of 
affairs in the Southern department, such Court of Inquiry cannot be 
speedily held, that Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a> be informed, that he is at 
liberty to repair to head-quarters, and take such command as the Commander-in-chief shall direct." 
or not any crime be laid to liis charge, I would as 
patiently submit to my fate, as officers who surrender 
a fort, or lose a ship. The special resolve of Congress 
dooms me to temporaiy disesteem, and loss of confidence." For these reasons, Sir, I can neither with 
advantage to the public, nor honor to mjself, accept, 
under my present circumstances, the proffered indulgence of Congress. 
</p><p>
Convinced that you have done every thing, which 
propriety could admit, to protect slandered officers 
against anonymous accusations, I will set out to-morrow morning for Virginia, where I shall wait for your 
Excellency's orders. 
</p><p>
With sincere thanks for the army in general, and 
myself in particular, I have the honor to be. Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
