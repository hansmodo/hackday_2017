DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The consequences of the enemy's possessing themselves of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> have appeared to me so terrible, 
that I have scarcely been able to sleep from apprehensions on the subject. These apprehensions daily 
increase. You have it in your power, at present, to 
prevent this dreadful event. If I do not mistake, the 
Congress have given you authority to take any step 
in that place, as well as here, which you shall think 
necessary for the public service ; but if they have not 
given you expressly and literally authority with respect to the city of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I am confident that 
any measure you think right to plan and put in execution will be approved of. 
</p><p>
I have the greatest reason to believe, from the most authentic intelligence, that the best members of the 
Congress expect that you would take much upon your self; as referring every matter of importance to them 
is, in fact, defeating the project. We have an instance of this in the fate of the motion for seizing the person of Mr. Tryon. To you they look up for decision 
by your conduct they are to be inspired with decision. In fact, your situation is such that the salvation 
of the whole depends on your striking, at certain crises, vigorous strokes, without previously communicating your intention. On this principle I venture to 
propose the following scheme, and to offer myself for the execution. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must be secured ; but it will never, I am 
afraid, be secured by direct order of the Congress, for 
obvious reasons. They find themselves awkwardly 
situated on this head ; you must step in to their relief. 
I am sensible that no men can be spared from the 
lines in our present circumstances; but I would propose that you should detach me into Connecticut, and 
lend your name for collecting a body of volunteers. 
I am assured that I shall find no difficulty in assembling a sufficient number for the purposes wanted. 
This body, in conjunction (if there should appear occasion to summon them) with the Jersey Regiment 
under the command of Lord Stirling, now at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, will effect the security of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and 
the expulsion or suppression of that dangerous banditti of Tories, who have appeared in Long Island, 
with the professed intention of acting against the 
authority of the Congress. Not to crush these serpents, before their rattles are grown, would be ruinous. 
</p><p>
I am assured, likewise, that the Connecticut volunteers, who will offer themselves for the service, will 
expect no pay, but, at most, the expenses of their 
provisions and perhaps of carriages for the conveyance 
of their baggage. When once we have secured the 
place with strict fortifications, and engaged the Friends 
of Liberty so far that they cannot recede, purged the 
City and Long Island of the leading Tories, the residence of these Connecticut volunteers will be no longer necessary; for there is no reason to doubt that 
the Congress will detach troops from Pennsylvania to 
garrison the place, although, from reasons hinted at, 
they may not choose to commence the operation. This 
manoeuvre I not only think prudent and right, but 
absolutely necessary to our salvation ; and if it meets, 
as I ardently hope it will, with your approbation, 
the sooner it is entered upon the better. Indeed, 
the delay of a single day may be fatal. I am, dear 
General, 
</p><p>
Yours most respectfully, 
</p><p>
