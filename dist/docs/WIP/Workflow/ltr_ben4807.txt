DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
It is long since I have heard from you. The last Packet 
brought me no Letter, and there are two Packets now due. 
It is supposed that the long easterly Winds have kept them 
back. We have had a severe and tedious Winter here. 
There is not yet the smallest Appearance of Spring. Not 
a Bud has push'd out, nor a Blade of Grass. The Turnips 
that us'd to feed the Cattle have been destroy'd by the Frost. 
The Hay in most Parts of the Country is gone, and the Cattle 
perishing for Want, the Lambs dying by thousands, thro' 
Cold and scanty Nourishment. Tuesday last I went to dine 
at our Friend Sir Matthew Featherstone's thro a heavy 
Storm of Snow. His Windows you know look into the Park. 
Towards Evening I observed the Snow still lying over all the Park, for the Ground was before too cold to thaw it, being 
itself frozen & Ice in the Canal. You cannot imagine a more 
winterlike Prospect! Sir M. and Lady F. always enquire 
kindly of your Welfare: As do Mr. and Mrs. Sargent. 
</p><p>
Sir John Pringle has heard from Mr. Bowman of your kindness to that gent n , and desires I would present his particular 
Acknowledgments for the Attention you have paid to his Recommendation. The Ohio Affair seems now near a Conclusion. And if the present Ministry stand a little longer, I 
think it will be compleated to our Satisfaction. <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a> 
has been indefatigable, and I think scarce any one I know 
besides would have been equal to the Task, so difficult it is 
to get Business forward here, in which some Party Purpose 
is not to be served: But he is among them, eternally, & 
leaves no Stone unturn'd. I would, however, advise you not 
to say anything of our Prospect of Success, till the Event 
appears, for many things happen between the Cup & the Lip. 
</p><p>
I have attended several Times this Winter upon your 
Acts of Assembly. The Board are not favourably disposed 
towards your Insolvent Acts, pretending to doubt whether 
distant Creditors, particularly such as reside in England, may 
not sometimes be injured by them. I have had a good deal 
of Conversation with Mr. Jackson about them, who remarks 
that whatever Care the Assembly may, according to my Representation of their Practice, take in examining into the Cases 
to prevent Injustice, yet upon the Face of the Acts nothing of that Care appears. The Preambles only say that such 
& such Persons have petitioned & set forth the Hardship 
of their Imprisonment, but not a Word of the Assembly's 
having enquired into the Allegations contained in such Petitions and found them true, not a Word of the general Consent 
of the principal Creditors, or of any publick Notice given of 
the Debtor's Intention to apply for such an Act; all which 
he thinks should appear in the Preambles, and then those 
Acts would be subject to less Objection and Difficulty in 
getting them through the Offices here. I would have you 
communicate this to the Speaker of the Assembly, with my 
best Respects. I doubt some of those Acts will be repeal'd. 
Nothing has been done, or is now likely to be done by the 
Parliament in American Affairs: The House of Commons 
& the City of London are got into a violent Controversy, 
that seems at present to engross the publick Attention, and 
the Session cannot continue much longer. 
</p><p>
By this Ship I send the Picture that you left with Meyer. 
He has never yet finished the Miniatures. The other Pictures I send with it are for my own House, but this you may 
</p><p>
take to yours. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
