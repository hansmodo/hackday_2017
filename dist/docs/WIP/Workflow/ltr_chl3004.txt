DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am extremely happy that there is any opening 
for a more comfortable establishment for poor Palfrey 
than his present. He is a valuable and capable 
man, and the pittance of a simple Aid-de-Camp-ship 
is wretched for a man, who has a family to support. 
On this principle, and in obedience to your commands, I shall send him to head-quarters without 
delay. I must, at the same time, confess that the 
loss will be irreparable to me, particularly if I am 
detached to Canada, of which there is the greatest 
probability, as I have received letters from divers 
members of the Congress, expressing their wishes 
that I should be employed in that department. 
Messrs. Griffin and Byrd are very good young men, 
but pretty much in the predicament of your Baylor. 
They can ride, understand, and deliver verbal orders, 
but you might as well set them the task of translating an Arabic or Irish manuscript as expect that 
they should, in half a day, copy a half sheet of orders. However, I must bustle through the difficulties, and not keep Palfrey out of the channel of a 
better provision. If I go to Canada, I suppose I 
shall be allowed secretaries, one French and one 
English. I do not see now it is possible to manage 
matters with less. Apropos., my dear General, if this 
is to be my province, shall you take it ill if I apply 
for one of my two Brigadiers, either Greene or Sullivan? It is a pleasure to have some officer about us 
in whom we can place confidence.

The ships of war, which were here, have been frightened away. The Asia lies betwixt Nutten's and Bedloe's Islands; the Duchess of Gordon, with his Excellency Governor Tryon, is under her stern ; the Phoenix 
is stationed a league below the Narrows. The Mercury and <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a></a> must inevitably fall into 
the hands of our fleet, unless they are fast asleep. 
We have taken strong hold of Hell Gate, so that the 
passage betwixt Long Island and the continent is 
absolutely blocked up to the enemy. I wait for some more force to prepare a post, or retrenched encampment, on Long Island, opposite to the city, for 
three thousand men. This is, I think, a capital object; for, should the enemy take possession of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, when Long Island is in our hands, they will 
find it almost impossible to subsist. The Jerseys are two well manned, and Connecticut, you know, will not furnish them, with any thing. 
</p><p>
What to do with the City, I own, puzzles me. It 
is so encircled with deep, navigable water, that who 
ever commands the sea must command the town. 
To-morrow I shall begin to dismantle that part of 
the fort next to the town, to prevent its being converted into a citadel. I shall barrier the principal 
streets, and, at least, if I cannot make it a Continental garrison, it shall be a disputable field of battle. 
</p><p>
Inclosed I send you a return of the good and in 
different pieces of cannon. The number of the bad, 
those, I mean, totally unfit for service, is, I believe, 
about sixty. As no Commissary of Stores has been 
appointed until this instant, it is impossible to give 
you a return of the other stores by this post, but 
you shall have it by the next. Lord Stirling is a 
great acquisition. He is a most zealous, active, and 
accurate officer.

A captain of a ship from Cadiz, who is a very intelligent person, tells us that Lord Howe and Captain Barrington, or Admiral Barrington, are appointed commissioners to propose terms to the Congress. This 
he had from the Consul Hardy. What d d fools 
the Ministry are ! How does your recruiting go on 
for the standing army ? Be so good as to tell Gates, 
to whom I shall write by the next post, that Mr. Nourse inclosed no letters for him. If little Eustace 
is not provided for in your army, and I should go 
to Canada, I think he had better be sent to me, and 
I will consign him to his uncle. I am got quit of my 
gout and fever, but remain extremely weak and tender. God preserve you, my dear General, from all 
disorders, at least until we have trampled Satan under our feet, 
</p><p>
My love to Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> and all the ladies. 
Adieu. Yours, most faithfully, 
</p><p>
