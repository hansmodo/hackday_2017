My dear Brother, 
</p><p>
A person who says he left New-York last Friday, reports 
that a putrid disorder prevailed there, and that among many 
others, it had rendered your house a house of mourning. 
This unexpected event affects me greatly. I can easily 
conceive what your feelings on the occasion must be, and 
sympathize with you very sincerely. I much regret my 
absence from you, for although friendly attentions cannot 
heal the wounds of affliction, they in some degree assuage 
their anguish. I know, and that by experience, that more 
consolation is to be derived from a firm confidence in the 
wisdom of Him who governs the world, and from resignation to His will who never errs, than from all other circumstances and considerations united. Our departed friends 
are but gone home before us. We must all follow, and, if 
prepared to follow, shall after a little while rejoin them, 
where death or pain can never intrude. 
It is true, that in the mean time we neither can nor ought 
to obliterate the impressions which such events naturally 
make on the human heart and mind. But there certainly 
is a difference between sustaining the burden of affliction 
as Christians, and sinking under it as men without fortitude 
or hope. 
</p><p>
May God grant you those consolations which the world 
cannot give nor take away. 
</p><p>
Believe me to be, 
</p><p>
Your very affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
