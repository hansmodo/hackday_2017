I have barely time, paper and ink to write my dear father a hurried official letter. 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival here with dispatches from the 
General to Admiral D'Estaing, I found that the 
fleet laboured under the greatest difficulty in procuring water ; its distance from the shore was too great 
to roll the casks down to the place of embarcation ; 
the disaffected inhabitants either refused their waggons, or granted them only at an exorbitant price. 
I have done every thing in my power to remedy this evil; but as we cannot have too many resources, I would propose that any fast sailing small craft in the 
Delaware may be immediately employed in bringing water round. The southerly winds which prevail on 
the coast at this season, will give them a quick voyage, and they will be in time if they arrive with La Chimere. 
</p><p>
It would give me pleasure to speak to you, particularly of the great qualities of the admiral. He has 
inspired me in the short acquaintance I have had with 
him, with uncommon respect. He laments the insipid 
part he is playing keeping the English fleet blocked 
up within Sandy Hook ; and taking prizes within their 
view every day does not satisfy a man of his great 
ideas. When six prizes were brought into him yesterday, he desired the major of the fleet to give some 
directions about those Drugs, and sighed at not being 
engaged in a way in which more honour was to be acquired. 
</p><p>
Two of the prizes that have been taken since my 
being here were armed, one with 4 and the other 
with 10 guns. One had a quantity of specie on 
board the profits of prizes taken from us. The 
fleet, men and officers appear to be in fine health, 
and eager to distinguish themselves in a naval combat. 
As much as it is against my desire, I must break off, 
an express rider must be diligent. 
</p><p>
My dearest friend and father, I pray God to protect you.
