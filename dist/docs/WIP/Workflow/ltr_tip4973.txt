... This is the fruit of war. Ah ! that greater ills did 
not attend it ! Compared with the distresses of some, ours 
are but slight and temporary inconveniences. We still live, 
and are even happy in the anticipation of future joys, 
while multitudes have fallen by the iron hand of war. How 
many tender, fond connections have been broken by it ! 
How many parents hearts have been rent with grief, 
how many widowed mates, how many spotless virgins (like 
the drooping lilies), have bowed their heads, oppressed 
with sorrow, at the loss of children, husbands, lovers ! 
And, my amiable mate, the possibility that that might be 
your lot has cost me many a tear. But God has spared me, in mercy to us both, in kindness to my parents and 
friends, in favor to our sweet babe, and, I hope, not 
without future benefit to my country. Let us, my dear, 
ever gratefully acknowledge God's goodness to us, and 
devoutly pray for the continuance of it . . .

... I remain well, and soon expect a summons from 
Congress to repair to the Board of War at Yorktown ; for, 
contrary to what I had heard, . . . that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>General Gates</a> 
was gone to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, a friend of mine just from York in 
forms, that Gates had accepted his appointment, and was 
daily expected there, and that upon his arrival the Board 
would be formed. I understand there is a vast field of 
business to be laid open to the Board, so that I despair of 
seeing you till the spring. Then, I hope and expect to re 
turn with you and your boy. . . . The information of my 
friend, above referred to, renders your coming with me in 
the spring still more necessary than I had imagined j for, 
though flour at Yorktown is less than four dollars a hundred, 
and beef but about eight pence, lawful money, [eleven cents 
and one ninth,] a pound, yet the members of Congress give 
thirty-seven dollars and one third a week for their board, 
without a servant, and but middling fare into the bargain. 
This sum would be considerably more than the amount of 
my wages per week ; of course I cannot live in that manner. 
And, as the necessaries of life are so cheap there, tis plain 
this dearness of board must be a most abominable extortion, 
and enhanced chiefly for cooking your food and finding a 
bed. Before I heard this, I had thought of a scheme for living 
at such a moderate expense as would enable me to maintain 
you and our son, as well as myself. This was by taking 
lodgings two or three miles out of town. At that distance 
I imagine I can live at a quarter of the expense ; for I would 
buy my own hay and firewood, and then I should have no 
one to pay extravagantly for feeding my horse or my fire ; 
for Millet can do both, and cook, too, extremely well, if 
need be. And this distance would by no means hinder 
me in the general course of business. On the other hand, as 
I expect close application will be necessary, to ride or walk 
that distance daily will be extremely beneficial, if not necessary, for my health. Now, the principal necessaries of life 
being thus cheap, were you with me to conduct the family 
affairs, the whole might ... be supported at much less, or, 
at least, without greater expense, than I alone at board. ...

Tuesday morning, December 30th. I might have told 
you, that, since our arrival at this place, which was on the 
20th instant, I have been at my own quarters, separate from 
the General's family, at whose quarters they are exceedingly 
pinched for room ; and, as I am in a house where there is a 
family, Millet borrows such utensils as are necessary for 
cooking. Had I conceived how much satisfaction, quiet, and even leisure, I should have enjoyed at separate quarters, I 
would have taken them six months ago. For at head-quarters there is a continual throng, and my room, in particular, 
(when I was happy enough to get one,) was always crowded 
by all that came to head-quarters on business, because there 
was no other cover for them, we having, for the most part, 
been in such small houses. Besides, at head-quarters much 
business passed through my hands, which is now done by the aides-de-camp, and I get rid of, being absent.
