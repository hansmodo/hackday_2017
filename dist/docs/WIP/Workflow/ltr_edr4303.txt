Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When I had the honor of writing to you last, the amendments had, I believe, been under consideration in a Committee of the Whole, and ten were adopted, 
and the two last rejected. Upon the report being made to the House, and without a debate of any consequence, the whole twelve were ratified. They are 
now with the Senate, who were yesterday employed about them. That body will attempt to postpone them ; for a majority is unfriendly to the Government. 
But an effort will be made against this destructive measure. 
</p><p>
In the House of Delegates, it was yesterday moved to declare the remainder of the amendments, proposed 
by our Convention, essential to the rights and liberties of the people. An amendment was offered, saying that, in pursuance of the wnll of the people, as 
expressed by our Convention, the General Assembly 
ouoht to uro'e Congress to a recomideration of them. 
The amendment was carried by the Speaker giving a 
casting vote. This shows the strength of the parties; 
and that, in the House of Delegates, the anti-federal 
force has diminished much since the last year. A 
representation is to be prepared, and the inclosed 
speaks the temper which we wish to exhibit in it. 
Whether we shall succeed in our attempt to carry 
such a remonstrance through, is with me very doubtful. It will be pushed, because it seems to discountenance any future importunities for amendments, 
which, in my opinion, is now a very important point. 
I should have been sanguine in my belief of carrying the representation through, in its present form, 
if the friends would have joined the enemies of the 
Constitution, in suspending the ratification of the 
eleventh amendment, which is exceptionable to me, 
in giving a handle to say, that Congress have endeavoured to administer an opiate, by an alteration, 
which is merely plausible. 
</p><p>
The twelfth amendment does not appear to me to 
have any real effect, unless it be to excite a dispute 
between the United States and every particular State, 
as to what is delegated. It accords pretty nearly 
with what our Convention proposed; but, being once 
adopted, it may produce new matter for the cavils 
of the designing. I am, dear Sir, your 
</p><p>
Obliged and affectionate friend and servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=edr" rel="me">Edmund Randolph</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I shall do myself the honor of replying to 
your official letter, as soon as the Assembly rises.
