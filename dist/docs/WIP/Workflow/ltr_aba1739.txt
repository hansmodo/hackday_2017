I HAVE waited with great patience, restraining, as much as possible, every anxious idea for three 
months. But now every vessel which arrives sets my expectation upon the wing, and I pray my guardian genius to waft me the happy tidings of your safety and welfare. Hitherto my wandering ideas have roved, like the son of Ulysses, from sea to sea, and 
from shore to shore, not knowing where to find you ; sometimes I fancied you upon the mighty waters, 
sometimes at your desired haven, sometimes upon the ungrateful and hostile shore of Britain, but at 
all times, and in all places, under the protecting care and guardianship of that Being, who not only clothes 
the lilies of the field, and hears the young ravens when they cry, but hath said, " Of how much more 
worth are ye than many sparrows ;" and this confidence, which the world cannot deprive me of, is 
my food by day, and my rest by night, and was all my consolation under the horrid ideas of assassination, the only event of which I had not thought, 
and, in some measure, prepared my mind.

When my imagination sets you down upon the Gallic shore, a land to which Americans are now 
bound to transfer their affections, and to eradicate all those national prejudices, which the proud and haughty nation, whom we once revered, craftily instilled into us, whom they once styled their children, I anticipate the pleasure you must feel, and, though 
so many leagues distant, share in the joy of finding the great interest of our country so generously espoused and nobly aided by so powerful a monarch. 
Your prospects must be much brightened ; for, when you left your native land, they were rather gloomy 
If an unwearied zeal and persevering attachment to the cause of truth and justice, regardless of the allurements of ambition on the one hand, or the threats of calamity on the other, can entitle any one to the reward of peace, liberty, and safety, a large portion 
of those blessings are reserved for my friend in his native land.

" O ! wouldst thou keep thy country's loud applause, 
Loved as her father, as her God adored, 
Be still the bold asserter of her cause, 
Her voice in council ; (in the fight her sword ;) 
In peace, in war, pursue thy country's good, 
For her, bare thy bold breast and pour thy generous blood."

Difficult as the day is, cruel as this war has been, separated as I am, on account of it, from the dearest 
connexion in life, I would not exchange my country for the wealth of the Indies, or be any other than an 
American, though I might be queen or empress of any nation upon the globe. My soul is unambitious 
of pomp or power. Beneath my humble roof, blessed with the society and tenderest affection of my 
dear partner, I have enjoyed as much felicity and as exquisite happiness, as falls to the share of mortals. 
 
And, though I have been called to sacrifice to my country, I can glory in my sacrifice and derive pleasure from my intimate connexion with one, who is esteemed worthy of the important trust devolved upon him.

Britain, as usual, has added insult to injustice and cruelty, by what she calls a conciliatory plan. From 
my soul I despise her meanness ; but she has long ago lost that treasure, which, a great authority tells 
us, exalteth a nation, and is receiving the reproaches due to her crimes. I have been much gratified with 
the perusal of the Duke of Richmond's speech. Were there ten such men to be found, I should still 
have some hopes, that a revolution would take place in favor of the virtuous few, " and the laws, the 
rights, the generous plan of power delivered down from age to age by our renowned forefathers," be again restored to that unhappy island.

Our public finances are upon no better footing than they were when you left us. Five hundred dollars is now offered by this town, per man, for nine months, to recruit the army. Twelve pounds a month for farming labor is the price, and it is not to be 
procured under. Our friends are all well and desire to be remembered to you. So many tender sentiments rush upon my mind, when about to close this letter to you, that I can only ask you to measure them by those which you find in your own bosom for
