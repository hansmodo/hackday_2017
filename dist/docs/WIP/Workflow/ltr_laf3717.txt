My dear General, 
</p><p>
I am sorry to think we are not yet gone, and there 
remain still some doubts of our going to-morrow. 
This delay I lament, not so much on private accounts, 
as I do on the account of our next campaign, in the 
planning of which your opinion, as I shall deliver it, must be of the greatest use to the common cause. 
As to the department of Foreign Affairs, I shall be 
happy to justify the confidence of the Congress, by 
giving my opinion, to the best of my power, whenever it is asked for. But the affair of finances will, 
I fear, be a difficult point for the American Minister, 
in which, however, I shall be happy to help him with 
my utmost exertions. The moment I arrive in France, 
I will write to you minutely how things stand, and 
give you the best accounts in my power. 
</p><p>
I have received every mark of affection in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
and am much attached to this town, to which I owe 
so many obligations j but, from public considerations, 
I have been impatient to leave it and go on board 
the frigate, where I receive all possible civilities, but 
where I had rather be under sail than at anchor. 
</p><p>
I beg your pardon, my dear General, for giving 
you so much trouble in reading my scrawls ; but we 
are going to sail, and my last adieu I must dedicate 
to my beloved General. Adieu, my dear General. I 
know your heart so well, that I am sure that no 
distance can alter your attachment to me. With the 
same candor, I assure you that my love, my respect, 
my gratitude for you, are above expression ; that, at 
the moment of leaving you, I felt more than ever 
the strength of those friendly ties that forever bind 
me to you, and that I anticipate the pleasure, the 
most wished-for pleasure, to be again with you, and, 
by my zeal and services, to gratify the feelings of 
my respect and affection. will you be pleased to 
present my compliments and respects to Mrs. Washington, and to remember me to <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a>. Adieu, my dear General.
</p><p>
Your respectful and tender friend,
