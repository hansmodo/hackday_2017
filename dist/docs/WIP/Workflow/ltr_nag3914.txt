DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I have just got letters from Gen. Gist, giving an account of a little 
action between <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Col. Laurens</a> and the enemy, about twelve miles below 
the ferry on Combahee, where he had taken post, and thrown up a 
little work to fire on the enemy's shipping, as they passed down the 
river. The enemy landed in considerable force. The Colonel's party 
being small, was beat back, in which conflict the Colonel fell, and we 
had the mortification to lose a howitzer. Gen. Gist got up just time 
enough to save the party from suffering further injury. We had twenty-four killed, wounded and missing. After this action the enemy embarked, and went down the river to the mouth of it, where they lay 
when Gen. Gist's dispatches came away; it is said they are going to 
Port Royal. There is no mention made of the enemy's loss; but they 
must have suffered considerably, and I believe they have got little or 
no rice. This is the substance of the General's letter. I lament the 
unhappy fate of <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Col. Laurens</a>. I am, with great respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
