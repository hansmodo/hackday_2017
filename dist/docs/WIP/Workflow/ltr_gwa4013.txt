My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your two letters of the 14th instant came duly to hand. With respect to Mr. *******, I beg you to be persuaded, 
that if all things in his favour are equal, your mentioning of him will have its weight. But in appointments of the sort 
he solicits, many matters must be attended to ; and as I am sure we have the same wishes respecting them, namely, to 
fix on characters who, under all circumstances, are most likely to answer the objects of their appointment, and to 
meet general approbation, I must endeavour to be circumspect in the selection ; and that I may have the greater 
variety to choose from, I would thank you and my other friends for giving me the names of such gentlemen as may 
occur, and are most prominent and fit to discharge the duties of commissioners. 
</p><p>
My information with respect to the general disposition of the people, accords with yours; and I have little doubt 
of a perfect amelioration of sentiment, alter the present fermentation (which is not only subsiding, but changing) has 
evaporated a little more. The dregs, however, will always remain, and the slightest motion will stir them up. With sincere esteem, and affectionate attachment, 
</p><p>
I am always yours, 
</p><p>
