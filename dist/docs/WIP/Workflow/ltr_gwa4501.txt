TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX, AT NEW WINDSOR.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The arrangement you have made, for the periods 
of transportation of the heavy stores from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
agrees perfectly with my ideas of the matter ; as I think 
we must be certainly able to determine ultimately upon our plan of operations by the time they are to be 
in motion. 
</p><p>
An enterprise, which I have long had in contemplation, will be executed in the course of this night, if 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker'>General Lincoln</a>, who commands the operating party, 
finds the attack advisable upon reconnoitring the situation of the enemy, and he can do it by surprise. 
The enterprise is against the posts upon the north 
end of York Island. The remainder of the army 
marched this morning towards Kingsbridge. Part of 
the French troops were last night at Ridgebury, and 
will be at Bedford this evening. They will, in the course of to-morrow, be at hand to support us, should 
there be occasion. At the same time that the posts upon York Island are attempted, I have planned a surprise upon Delancey's corps at Morrisania, which is 
to be executed by the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a> in conjunction with Slu'kK)n's regiment and Waterbury's State troops. 
</p><p>
Should we succeed in the attempt upon the posts, every effort will be made to hold them, and your assistance will be naturally necessary. I shall take the 
speediest method of communicating the event to <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='co-worker'>General McDougall</a> at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, who will bring out the militia to our support. You may therefore take it for 
granted, that we have succeeded, if you see or hear 
the signals. You will in such case come immediately 
down, leaving Colonel Stevens to put every thing in 
readiness to follow. I am, &,c.
