Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to send to your Excellency an open packet for the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>. You will 
there find the copy of a letter to me from M. Destouches. I lament the ill success of an expedition. 
which, if it had succeeded, would have been doubly 
agreeable to us by its utility to our allies, and by 
the honor it would have reflected upon the arms of 
the King. As to the rest, it appears that our Commanders have fulfilled this latter point; and all the 
world is satisfied that, having a superior force to 
contend against, the manner of the contest has been 
highly honorable to them. 
</p><p>
I wait for happier events. Sir, from the campaign 
which is now about to open ; and I doubt not the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> has given you, in detail, the 
news which he has received from France. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
