My dear General, 
</p><p>
I should not so long have restrained the expressions of a heart flowing with the most affectionate 
and respectful attachment, if care had not been taken 
to communicate our intelligence officially. In the 
mean time, I have never found it so necessary to devote my attention to the public business. Amidst 
pressing distresses, it will give your Excellency pleasure to be assured that Congress have deliberated 
with unanimity, and decided with firmness, and that 
every thing, within their powder, is nearly accomplished for vigorous efforts in the course of the next year. 
If the States will draw forth their resources ; if our 
ally will seriously cooperate, by assuming a naval 
superiority in the American seas ; if we are seasonably furnished with the clothing, arms, and ammunition which we have reason to expect ; and obtain the 
aid of money, which we have once more attempted to 
borrow ; — if these circumstances in any tolerable degree combine, your Excellency will at last see a prospect, under the Divine blessing, of finishing the war 
with glory. 
</p><p>
But it is obvious that we have many difficulties 
to encounter. Government, instead of possessing the 
confidence and the dignity necessary to enforce its 
counsels, is surrounded bv clamorous creditors and 
insidious speculators; and, what is worse, the intemperance of our friends conspires with the malice of 
our enemies to render it odious. Congress may err; 
they are not exempt from State and personal prejudices ; they are liable to be deceived. But nothing is 
more certain than that, in the common cause, their 
intentions are pure, their zeal, their cares, their pains 
unbounded; and the time will come when, if their 
measures are not admired, they will be approved. Indeed, Sir, an honest and disinterested patriot requires 
uncommon fortitude to render himself responsible, in 
an hour of such intolerable licentiousness. Those 
who placed their happiness in reputation retire from a 
theatre, where, while they are tortured by public distresses, they are in danger of disgrace. The intrigues 
of speculators are more and more alarming. Our paper money lately suffered a convulsion, without any 
apparent cause, which threatened its total dissolution. 
Not contented with the infinite evils which they 
have entailed on their country, they have practised 
their arts on the Cabinet of France, and with such 
success, that one of our Ministers received a formal intimation that the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a> would be 
instructed to remonstrate against the act of the 18th 
of March, as a violation of public faith, and an injury 
to the trading part of that nation, which ought to be 
repaired. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> has acquired applause by a 
memorial to Count de Vergennes on this subject, full 
of good sense and dignity. The necessity and the 
justice of that memorable system are vindicated by 
reasons and facts which force conviction. The capital 
figure which the French factors made in drawing on 
the depreciation, and their avarice in striving to exact 
specie for the nominal sums of the bills, when it is 
notorious that they raised the price of their commodities in proportion to the current exchange, are exposed ; and it is demonstrated, that, instead of suffering, they greatly profited by that national calamity. 
Nor is the proper inference neglected, that a Government capable, in a free country, of executing a plan 
SO disgusting to the self-interested, must possess unlimited confidence, and be established on the firmest 
basis. I am persuaded that this seasonable representation will remove ever} prejudice, and prevent the 
effects of an attempt big with ruin. 
</p><p>
Another great difficulty which embarrasses us, is 
the absolute dependence which we are compelled to 
place on the exertions of the States individually. A 
failure in one may draw upon us insupportable distress. If the supplies of provisions should be punctually furnished, the transportation alone is an expense of such magnitude that I never think of it 
but with anxiety, especially when we consider how 
deeply pecuniary taxes are anticipated, by certificates 
in the hands of the farmers. There is a remedy; 
but whether we have a sufficient degree of public 
spirit to apply it, can only be known by experiment. 
Why should not the opulent contribute the whole or 
a large proportion of their plate ? Why should not 
the farmer break in upon his capital, if his annual 
produce is incompetent ? Nothing is clearer than 
that this would be the truest economy, as a foundation would be laid to terminate the war by a great 
and decisive effort. These are resources in the power 
of every Legislature; and I shall think them inexcusable, if, seeing the necessity to be so urgent, they 
shrink from the burden. A duty on imports, exports, and prizes, will be strongly recommended by 
Congress ; and, if approved by the States, it must 
produce a considerable revenue. 
</p><p>
We have made an estimate of the national expense 
for a year from next January. Except the Quartermaster's branch, it is tolerably accurate. I should be 
happy if our means to defray it were certain and 
adequate ; but This is not to be relied on, unless we 
are effectually roused by a sense of our common danger, and the necessity of concluding, with glory and 
expedition, a war of devastation. Every liberal hand 
must be opened; every patriotic heart must be animated ; every public and private effort must be exerted to strengthen and support our army, to give 
weight to our national counsels, and secure them obedience at home and reputation abroad. Without the 
first, the courage, perseverance, and military accomplishments of our General must be frustrated ; without the last, it would be madness to hope for credit, 
alliance, or respect from foreign powers. 
</p><p>
After a studied contempt of the power of our 
enemy, which has marked the progress of our contest, too great a dependence on foreign succour claims 
a rank in our political errors. I speak of the public 
opinion, exempting Congress, as I ought, from a share 
in this folly. Charmed with a revolution so friendly 
to the rights of human nature, and so humbling to 
the insolence of Britain, the people were too apt to 
imagine that the coffers of Europe would be emptied 
into our lap without reserve. But, to say nothing 
of the Dutch, experience has shown that the Spaniards, on whom we principally relied, are not to be 
moved by disinterested considerations. That Cabinet 
does not imitate the French in liberality. They view 
the contiguity of those States to the source of their 
treasures, and their rising greatness, with a sufficient 
degree of jealousy. They are cautious of our alliance, 
unless they can acquire solid advantages. They are 
courted by England, and tempted by offers which, 
though they cannot accept without sacrificing their 
honor, their flimily compact, and the esteem of the 
northern powers, they yet seem to countenance, as a 
means to lead us to concessions, of which we cannot think without reluctance. On no other principle is 
Cumberand's residence at Madrid, or the dilatoriness 
which has accompanied the treaty, to be reconciled. 
With respect to a loan, if their inclination was ever 
so prompt, it appears to me either that their funds 
are not productive, or that their economy is even 
worse than our own. They might, however, interpose 
their responsibility, as they have already done for 
the bills which we have drawn and for the clothing which they have supplied; and it would afford us 
essential relief These hints will open another field 
of embarrassment, the extent of which your Excellency will fully perceive. 
</p><p>
I shall only add to the catalogue, that we have 
advice that Sir Henry Clinton has written to his 
Court for a strong reenforcement, or leave to retire 
from his command ; that he has received an approbation of his conduct in flattering terms, and a promise 
of support; and that orders are accordingly issued for 
raising a regiment of cavalry and nine of infantry. 
</p><p>
But, while we are called upon to examine our own 
circumstances with candor, lest we should be deceived by a false estimate, our enemies, it is evident, do 
not repose on a bed of roses. They continue to be 
disturbed by the spirit of independence which pervades Ireland. The Commons of that kingdom lately 
hesitated to agree to a duty, amounting to a prohibition on raw sugars from England. Yelverton, their 
patriot, declared that the Irish trade should, in all 
respects, be upon a perfect equality with the British. 
He rejected the idea of a disparity between the sister kingdoms with contempt, and threatened the courtiers that, if they persisted in their opposition, he 
would put himself at the head of the associators, and 
establish the freedom of commerce by arms. This is 
an argument which carries conviction. Strange that 
in Ireland it should be consistent with loyalty, and 
in America be branded with the appellation of rebellion, and under that absurd idea serve to color over 
every species of inhumanity and vengeance. 
</p><p>
In the West Indies, from the late destructive hurricane, and on the ocean, by a train of capital losses, 
the enemy have suffered most severely, and in the 
tenderest point, their trade, the source of their wealth 
and credit. Their internal dissensions, which, instead 
of being extinguished, are only smothered by the 
vigor which the temerity of Gordon threw into the 
scale of their Government, is a malady which hangs 
heavy upon their Administration. The Convention of 
the neutral maritime powers, which has aimed a fatal 
blow at the sovereignty of the British flag, and the 
imminent danger of their being involved in a war 
with Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and Holland, if they 
persist in a claim so odious, and of drawing down 
the resentment of their own subjects and universal 
contempt, if they relinquish it ; the late insult, offered 
them by Portugal, in shutting their ports against 
their ships of war and prizes ; the impracticability of 
their raising more troops in Germany; the favorable 
light in which our independence is viewed throughout Europe, and the evident satisfaction it gives even 
the princes, on whom they most relied, to see the 
British dominion, commerce, and naval strength circumscribed; their disappointment in not being able, 
by the most disgraceful sacrifices, to detach Spain 
from the war; their failure in ways and means the 
present year; the immensity of their national debt 
and current expenditures; — all these circumstances, 
combined with the necessity of renewing their preparations to oppose the belligerent powers at the very moment they looked for submission from America, are more than sufficient to form a contrast between us and our enemies, by no means to our disadvantage ; nor does it seem presumptuous to think 
that, if we endeavour to deserve the blessing, peace, 
liberty, and independence must, before long, crown 
our wishes. 
</p><p>
I have drawn this letter to an immoderate length. 
Ascribe it to a desire of possessing you of my own 
view of our public affairs, as far as I am at liberty. 
</p><p>
I will only add that the visit of the French noblemen has given pleasure. The Chevalier, particularly, 
recommends himself by his agreeable manners and 
literary accomplishments. Be pleased to pay my 
most respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington. I 
was greatly mortified at her passing through this 
town without my knowledge, as I wished to have 
done myself the honor of attending her to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

P. S. Your Excellency has remarked that the 
communications, with which you honored me on the 
arrangement of the army, hospitals, &c., have had 
their effect.
