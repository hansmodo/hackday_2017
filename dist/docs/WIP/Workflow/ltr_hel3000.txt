SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last, of the 30th ultimo, per Barry, I had 
the honor of receiving and presenting to Congress 
your Excellency's favor of the 29th of that month, 
which, having been taken under consideration, the in 
closed act was this day resolved, for empowering 
your Excellency, when you shall judge it necessary, 
to call on the States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and 
New Jersey, for five thousand militia-men, armed and 
accoutred. I have the honor to be, with great esteem 
and respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hel" rel="me">HENRY LAURENS</a>, President of Congress. 
</p><p>
P. S. Evening, 9 o'clock. M. de Francis this moment delivered me your Excellency's favor of the 1st 
instant, which shall be presented to Congress on 
Monday. Meantime permit me, Sir, to intimate that 
I had backed the report of your Excellency's letter as part of a speech in Parliament, May 26th, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, with the following preliminary remarks ; "I accompanied my letter to Congress by 
one to General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, wherein, upon an opinion of his character, I asked him for his support to an application that could not interfere with the public duties of our respective situations. I shall 
beg leave to read his answer as part of my speech ; and I do it. 
Sir, not only lest, in these times of doubt and aspersion, I should 
incur censure for holding private correspondence with an enemy, but 
likewise because I think the letter, though from an enemy, does 
honor to the human heart." 
</p><p>
While <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> was at <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>'s house, in <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, he wrote as follows to Lord George Germain, October 20th, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, concerning the American troops. 
</p><p>
"I should now hold myself unjustifiable, if I did not confide to 
your Lordship my opinion, upon a near inspection, of the rebel troops. 
The standing corps, which I have seen, are disciplined. I do not 
of the 27th of February with an information to Congress, that one gentleman of the late Committee on 
the <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> inquiry had retired, and that it was 
impracticable for me to give that attention which 
was due to an affair of such importance. A new 
Committee was immediately appointed. These gentlemen, some eight or ten days ago, offered a report, 
when Mr. Duer interposed arguments, which induced 
the House to postpone the consideration for two 
days. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to name that gentleman, 
because his declared motives for delay were coupled 
with assurances of particular considerations respecting 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>. This very morning I called on 
Mr. Duer, and reminded him of his engagements, 
urging the painful situation in which his friends and 
the other General Officers remained. He replied, " I 
will soon bring on that business." Your Excellency's 
present letter will prove a further incitement. I 
have very long felt for the gentlemen who are subjects of the inquiry ; and, although it was with extreme reluctance I obeyed the order of Congress to 
be of the original Committee, after having urged 
such reasons for exemption as appeared to me very 
forcible, yet I cannot charge myself with delinquency at any stage in the course of our proceedings. 
To account for the uncouth and entangled state of 
this inquiry, would not be half so difficult, as it hard the term, but apply it to the great fundamental points of 
military institution; sobriety, subordination, regularity, and courage. 
The militia are inferior in method and movement, but not a jot less 
serviceable in woods. My conjectures were very different after the 
affair of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, but I am convinced they were delusive; and 
it is a duty to the state to confess it. The panic of the rebel troops 
is confined, and of short duration ; the enthusiasm is extensive and 
permanent." might be impertinent to the proper line of my correspondence. From this consideration I shall only 
add, that I trust your Excellency's present application will have that weight which is justly due.
