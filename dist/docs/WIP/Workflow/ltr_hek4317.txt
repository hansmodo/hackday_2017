My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Possessing, as I do, a thousand evidences of your 
friendship, I am persuaded that you will readily believe me, -when I say that my silence of late has 
been the effect of my unwillingness to intrude, lest I 
should for a moment prevent the consideration and 
different views you give to the important subjects incessantly before you. 
</p><p>
Although the same cause continues to prevent my 
interruption, yet I am apprehensive sometimes that 
you may think me unmindful of your kindnesses, 
especially after the receipt of your affectionate letter 
by <a href='/results.php?tla=wib' rel='met'>Mr. Bingham</a>, the last summer. The loss of two 
lovely children, on which you condoled in that letter, 
has been recently revived and increased by the death 
of our son, of seven years of age, bearing your name. 
His health has always been delicate, having been 
born prematurely. We flattered ourselves that his 
constitution would mend with his years, but we have 
been disappointed. Unfortunate, indeed, have we been 
in the death of eight of our children, requiring the 
exercise of our whole stock of philosophy and religion. We find ourselves afflicted by an irresistible, 
but invisible power, to whom we must submit. But 
the conflict is almost too great for the inconsolable 
mother, who will go mourning to her grave. 
</p><p>
We have lately come from St. George's to pass the 
winter in this town. Indeed, this is our general plan. 
We may, however, as we grow older, find it inconvenient. We are distant about two hundred miles by 
land, which we may easily ride in six days, the snow being on the ground, or with wheels with a little 
improvement of a small portion of the road. The 
taverns on the route are as good as on any other 
two hundred miles on the Continent. 
</p><p>
I am beginning to experience the good effects of 
my residence on my lands. I may truly say that 
the estate is more than double in its value, since I 
determined to make it my home. The only inconvenience we experience, is the want of society. This 
will probably lessen daily. Our communication by 
water to this town is constant and cheap. We can 
obtain the transportation of any article from this town 
to St. George's, cheaper than the same can be carted 
from any store to the vessel. This egotism would require an apology to any other person than yourself 
</p><p>
For your own sake, I rejoice at the near approach 
of your retirement. In it, I pray God that you may 
enjoy all the felicity, of which the human condition 
is susceptible. The consciousness of having acted well, 
would, under any circumstances, have elevated your 
soul above the peltings of storms raised by malice 
and envy But in addition to this consciousness, the 
consecration of your retirement by the unlimited gratitude of your country, must present, in the decline of 
your life, the most perfect reward. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself, before you leave the helm, you 
will have dissipated the clouds raised by the causeless jealousy of the French Administration. If not, 
we must appeal from them, mad and drunk with 
power as they may be, to the time when they shall 
have recovered their senses. We have not injured 
them, but have only taken those due precautions, 
which our own happiness required. If they madly 
continue to war against our innocent and rightful 
commerce, we must make an account thereof, and 
look for compensation through all the events of ages, 
and we shall assuredly find it at some period or 
other, with full interest. But I hope we shall not, 
under any circumstances, at present, attempt reprisals. 
Their fit of insanity cannot last long. St. Domingo 
is, and will be in the course of this winter, the victim of the villany of its Administration. The whites 
will either he starved or murdered by the blacks. 
</p><p>
It cannot be expected that there will be any danger of the French attempting an invasion of our 
country. But if they should, we must resist. And 
this appears to be the only case in which we should 
suffer ourselves to be dragged into the war. What 
an eventful winter this will be at Paris ! Especially, 
if the army of Italy should be arrested, or defeated, 
in addition to the retreat of the two armies of Jourdan and jNIoreau, from Germany. From information 
generally circulating here, and particularly from , 
</p><p>
who has the last autumn arrived from France, in 
which he resided for several years, no doubt rests in 
my mind, but the measures of the French Administration towards this country, have been excited by 
the Americans in Paris, in consequence of letters received from persons of the same opinions in the United States.

I had not intended to intermix any politics in this 
letter, which I meant solely as the recognition of a 
grateful heart. But they have thrust themselves in 
unawares. Mrs. Knox unites with me in presenting 
our respectful and affectionate attachments to you and 
Mrs. Washington. And I am, &c.,
