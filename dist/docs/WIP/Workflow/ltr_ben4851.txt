DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
At length we have got rid of Lord Hillsborough, and Lord 
Dartmouth takes his place, to the great satisfaction of all 
the friends of America. You will hear it said among you, 
I suppose, that the interest of the Ohio planters has ousted 
him; but the truth is, what I wrote you long since, that all 
his brother ministers disliked him extremely, and wished for 
a fair occasion of tripping up his heels; so, seeing that he 
made a point of defeating our scheme, they made another of 
supporting it, on purpose to mortify him, which they knew 
his pride could not bear. I do not mean they would have 
done this, if they had thought our proposal bad in itself, or 
his opposition well founded ; but I believe, if he had been on 
good terms with them, they would not have differed with 
him for so small a matter. The King, too, was tired of him 
and of his administration, which had weakened the affection 
and respect of the colonies for a royal government, of which 
(I may say it to you) I used proper means from time to time 
that his Majesty should have due information and convincing 
proofs. More of this when I see you. 
</p><p>
The King's dislike made the others more firmly united 
in the resolution of disgracing Hillsborough, by setting at 
nought his famous report. But, now that business is done, 
perhaps our affair may be less regarded in the cabinet and 
suffered to linger, and possibly may yet miscarry. Therefore let us beware of every word and action, that may betray 
a confidence in its success, lest we render ourselves ridiculous in case of disappointment. We are now pushing for a 
completion of the business; but the time is unfavourable, 
everybody gone or going into the country, which gives room 
for accidents. 
</p><p>
I am writing by Falconer, and therefore in this only add, 
that I am ever your affectionate father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P.S. The regard Lord Dartmouth has always done me 
the honour to express for me, gives me room to hope being able 
to obtain more in favour of our colonies upon occasion, than 
I could for some time past.
