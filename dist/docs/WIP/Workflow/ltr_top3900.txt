HONORED MADAM : 
</p><p>
When I went to town yesterday, I found our works as strong as the 
high ideas which had been raised of them by report had made me figure 
them to myself. I likewise saw every part of them thronged with men, 
and matters in general in the best posture for a vigorous defence. I 
heard it reported that the Governor is shortly to take the field and draw 
down as many of our country militia into a camp to be formed some 
where on this side of the country as he can collect, as our militia in general cannot be prevailed on to come into town, and it is hoped this 
measure will be productive of very good consequences. The enemy 
continue their approaches but slowly ; none of their works are nearer 
than 600 yards from our lines. Their men-of-war continue opposite to 
Fort Johnson. Their Admiral s ship was so much damaged as to be 
obliged to continue on the careen, part of two days, in order to repair. 
</p><p>
The North Carolina and Virginia troops which cannot now be at a 
very great distance, together with such of our country militia as the 
Governor may collect, will, it is thought, be sufficient to oblige the 
enemy to raise the siege, or at all events will much incommode them and 
in the end render their repulse the more certain. 
</p><p>
I remain, dear mother, sincerely your affectionate and dutiful son, 
</p><p>
