Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This letter will be short ; the intention of it being little more 
than to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors from 
London, dated the 7th and 13th of April, and 1st and 2d of May, 
on the business which had been entrusted to you of a public nature ; and of your other letters of the 12th of April, and the 
3d of May, which more immediately relate to my private requests. 
</p><p>
Permit me to thank you, my good sir, for the attention you 
have given to the latter ; and, as far as your communications 
with the British Government had gone, to assure you of my 
entire approbation of your conduct respecting the former. I 
shall await the answer, which your address of the 30th of April 
will extort (if silence be not resolved on) from the Duke of 
Leeds, before I write more fully to you on that head. I am, &;c. 
</p><p>
