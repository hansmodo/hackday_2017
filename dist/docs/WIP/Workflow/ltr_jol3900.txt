DEAR GENERAL : 
</p><p>
The letter and intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, enclosed herewith, although it was probably his first upon the subject of the enemies movement, and the foundation of all his anxiety, did not reach me till late 
last night, I must confess I am not much inclined to believe that the enemy meditate any such enterprise as his information alludes to. However, it is possible, and the collecting our force within a proper 
distance, for a general re-union or co-operation, is a point of prudence, and canhot be attended with any ill consequences. Monk's Corner is 
said to be a very exhausted country; there is nothing to be had. Col. Maham's cavalry propose crossing Strawberry Ferry, where boats are provided, and light troops can always cover his return by the same way, 
which will save some distance in marching. I think it agreeable to the spirit of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>'s letter, that the part of your brigade now in this 
vicinity should cross Strawberry, and be somewhere in a position to communicate with us, and have given this as my opinion to him. 
Should anything serious happen, your counsel and support are too important not to be wished for by the General and army. 
</p><p>
I am, with sincere esteem, dear General, yours, 
</p><p>

P. S. The enemy had not moved yesterday or discovered any signs of it.
