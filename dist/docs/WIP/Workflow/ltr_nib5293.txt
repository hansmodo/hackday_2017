My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . You know better than I do what is to happen in 
Washington. What will happen in the Country unless Congress interposes, is but too manifest the whole future is full 
of gloom and confusion. My own course is decided all the*s 
other Banks and all the merchants may break, but the Bank \ 
of the United States shall not break. I have asked Com 6 . Biddle what is the least sail under which a man of war can -" 
lie to in a gale of wind, and he says a close reefed main top 
sail. So our squadron will all be put under close reefed main 
top sails and ride out the gale for the next two years. As to 
those who have no sea room &amp; breakers under their lee, they 
must rely on <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> or Amos Kendall.
