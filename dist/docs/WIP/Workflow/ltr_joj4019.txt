Sir, 
</p><p>
Although I have not the honour of a personal acquaintance with you, yet I am so well informed of your character as to believe you will always be happy in leading a young 
soldier to glory, and to afford him that countenance and protection that brave and generous youth seldom fails to invite. Permit me, therefore, to recommend to you 
Major Matthew Clarkson, who is now going to place himself under your command; and be assured that you will confer an obligation on me by becoming his friend as well as his general. 
</p><p>
I am, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
