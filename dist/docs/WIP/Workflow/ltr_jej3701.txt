Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter to Colonel Harrison turns out as I expected before I received your full information. If the 
whole had been read and attended to, it was impossible to put any other construction on your manner 
of treating the subject than to convince your correspondent of the absolute necessity of great exertions this campaign, while we had a promising prospect before us, lest, by remissness and delay, we 
should find our ally, as well as ourselves, embarrassed with greater difficulties than at present ; and 
I very sincerely wish, should this summer pass away 
without some signal advantage gained on our part, 
we may not find your conjectures verified in the 
event.

I have my hopes we shall yet be able to do somefhing important upon the arrival of the French reenforcement, as I presume their fleet will then command the water, without which, I confess, I have no 
sanguine expectations. With the command of the 
water, the enterprise may be successful. Mr. Bingham has received a letter from Martinique, informing 
him the combined fleets fell to leeward on the 5th of 
July, supposed for Jamaica ; thirty-three or thirty-six 
ships of the line, and tAvelve thousand troops. They 
expected a reenforcement of a few thousand troops 
more. If this account be true, it is probable Jamaica 
will fall, and that we may have them along our 
coast.

You are desired, by some late resolutions, to turn 
your thoughts towards the recovery of South Carolina and Georgia, as soon as the operations of the 
campaign in this quarter have been executed. Gates's 
and De Kalb's letters represent the distresses of the 
Southern department in a very gloomy light, as to 
provisions and equipments. The Virginia recruits, 
when raised, are ordered to join that army. If this 
interfere with your plans, you should let us know it, 
as they will not be ready to march until the beginning of next month. The law passed by the Legislature will probably bring into the field about three 
thousand. A Colonel or Major Pinckney, of South Carolina, writes Colonel Motte, a Delegate of that State, 
that the enemy are not more than twenty-five hundred strong at their posts in the country, exclusive of horse, of which they have a large corps, and 
about eight hundred or one thousand men in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. Of our twenty-five hundred mihtia, not above 
fifteen hundred had reached Hillsborough, in North 
Carolina. But Mr. Jameson, of the Virginia Privy 
Council, writes us that many of the deserters had 
been taken up and sent forward to Hillsborough, 
had about twelve hundred militia under him. 
Baylor's and Bland's dragoons nearly equipped, so 
that if they can get provisions sufficient and forage, 
which, by this time, it is probable they are furnished with, they will be in condition to face the enemy, 
and I hope drive them into the town.

We have been greatly perplexed the last week 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s refusal to act in the office of 
Quartermaster-General, unless the new system was 
totally repealed, and he was allowed to conduct it, 
under your direction, in such manner as he thought 
most conducive to the public service. Besides, Congress were to request Pettit and Cox to resume their 
offices.'-' If <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> thought the new system 
wanted amendment, and had pointed out the defect, 
Congress would have considered the matter, and, I 
doubt not, would have made the necessarv alteration. 
But the manner of these demands, made in such 
peremptory terms, at the moment of action, when the 
campaign was opened, the enemy in the field, and 
our ally waiting for cooperation, has lessened <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> not only in the opinion of Congress, but 
I think, of the public ; and I question whether it will 
terminate with the acceptance of his refusal only. 
</p><p>
On Saturday <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a> was appointed to 
the office of Quartermaster-General, with the rank 
of Colonel, and the pay and rations of a BrigadierGeneral, and to hold his place at the Board of War 
without pay or right to act, while in the office of 
Quartermaster-General. This gentleman's integrity, 
ability, and attention to business will, I hope, not 
only prevent the evils to be apprehended from a 
change in so important a department at this time, 
but will, I hope, be able to reform some of the 
abuses crept into that business, and lessen the amazing expenditures of the department. He must, if he accepts, have a disagreeable office in the present state 
of our finance ; but we must support him all we can. 
The promotion I lately mentioned has not taken 
place, though if we take up the business I suppose 
it will be done ; as M. is the oldest Colonel, and 
Gates is the only Major-General belonging to Virginia, and the State has a right to two. But I see no 
occasion of stirring in it at present, as, if taken up, 
it must be on the general principle of promotion, 
and then not only Virginia, but Maryland, and other 
States, will expect to partake of the same privilege 
of bringing forward their officers, when, I believe, 
there are few States whose lines are so full as to 
justify the promotions. I am, &c.,
