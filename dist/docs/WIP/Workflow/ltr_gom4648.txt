Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In reading over my letter of yesterday, I find that I omitted 
to mention the war with Spain. The truth is, that it was a 
matter so much of course and of so little importance, that it 
escaped my recollection. Our Commissioners will doubtless 
turn it to account. 
</p><p>
Last evening I was informed that the French army in Flanders has been defeated, but as this is not an official account, I 
merely mention it as it is, viz. a letter sent express by an 
individual at Brussels on seeing sundry runaways arrive, and 
stores, &c. &c. coming in at sixes and sevens, with the re 
port that the enemy were at the gates. On the other hand, 
you must take into account that the siege of Maestricht being 
raised only the third, one day's rest was necessary for the 
troops, which had come on by forced marches. Now as the 
action must have taken place at Tongres, about forty miles 
from Brussels, and the courier in question left that city in the 
night of the fifth, it would follow that the enemy must have 
marched from Maestricht in the night of the fourth, and at 
tacked at break of day ; otherwise the runaways would hardly 
have got in by the evening of the fifth. On the whole, there 
is but just time enough for such an affair to have happened, 
and that is all. If there is any confirmation I will mention it. 
I am, &c.
