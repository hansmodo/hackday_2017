MY MUCH LOVED FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DARE not express to you, at three hundred miles 
distance, how ardently I long for your return. I 
have some very miserly wishes, and cannot consent 
to your spending one hour in town, till, at least, I 
have had you twelve. The idea plays about my heart, 
unnerves my hand, whilst I write, awakens all 
the tender sentiments, that years have increased and 
matured, and which, when with me, were every day 
dispensing to you. The whole collected stock of ten 
weeks absence knows not how to brook any longer 
restraint, but will break forth and flow through my 
pen. May the like sensations enter thy breast, and 
(spite of all the weighty cares of state) mingle them 
selves with those I wish to communicate ; for, in giving them utterance, I have felt more sincere 
pleasure, than I have known since the 10th of Au 
gust. Many have been the anxious hours I have 
spent since that day ; the threatening aspect of our 
public affairs, the complicated distress of this province, the arduous and perplexed business in which 
you are engaged, have all conspired to agitate my 
bosom with fears and apprehensions to which I have 
heretofore been a stranger ; and, far from thinking 
the scene closed, it looks as though the curtain was 
but just drawn, and only the first scene of the infernal 
plot disclosed ; and whether the end will be tragical, 
Heaven alone knows. You cannot be, I know, nor 
do I wish to see you, an inactive spectator ; but, if the 
sword be drawn, I bid adieu to all domestic felicity, 
and look forward to that country, where there are 
neither wars nor rumors of war, in a firm belief, that, 
through the mercy of its King, we shall both rejoice 
there together. 
</p><p>
I greatly fear, that the arm of treachery and violence is lifted over us, as a scourge and heavy punishment from Heaven for our numerous offences, 
and for the misimprovement of our great advantages. 
If we expect to inherit the blessings of our fathers, 
we should return a little more to their primitive simplicity of manners, and not sink into inglorious ease. 
We have too many high-sounding words, and too 
few actions that correspond with them I have spent 
one Sabbath in town since you left. I saw no difference in respect to ornament, &c. ; but in the country you must look for that virtue, of which you find 
but small glimmerings in the metropolis. Indeed, 
they have not the advantages, nor the resolution, 
to encourage our own manufactories, which people in the country have. To the mercantile part, it 
is considered as throwing away their own bread ; 
but they must retrench their expenses, and be con 
tent with a small share of gain, for they will find but 
few who will wear their livery. As for me, I will 
seek wool and flax, and work willingly with my 
hands ; and, indeed, there is occasion for all our industry and economy. You mention the removal of 
our books, &c., from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> ; I believe they are safe 
there, and it would incommode the gentlemen to re 
move them, as they would not then have a place to 
repair to for study. I suppose they would not choose 
to be at the expense of boarding out. Mr. Williams, 
I believe, keeps pretty much with his mother. Mr. 
Hill s father had some thoughts of removing up to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, provided he could be accommodated with 
a house, which he finds very difficult. 
</p><p>
Mr. Cranch s last determination was to tarry in 
town, unless any thing new takes place. His friends 
in town oppose his removal so much, that he is determined to stay. The opinion you have entertained 
of General Gage is, I believe, just. Indeed, he professes to act only upon the defensive. The people 
in the country begin to be very anxious for the 
Congress to rise ; they have no idea of the weighty 
business you have to transact, and their blood boils 
with indignation at the hostile preparations they are 
constant witnesses of. Mr. Quincy's so secret departure is matter of various speculation ; some say 
he is deputed by the Congress, others, that he is gone 
to Holland, and the Tories say he is gone to be hanged.
</p><p>
I rejoice at the favorable account you give me of 
your health. May it be continued to you. My health 
is much better than it was last fall ; some folks say 
I grow very fat. I venture to write almost any thing 
in this letter, because I know the care of the bearer. 
He will be most sadly disappointed, if you should be 
broken up before he arrives ; as he is very desirous 
of being introduced by you to a number of gentle 
men of respectable character. I almost envy him, 
that he should see you before I can. Mr. Thaxter 
and Mr. Rice present their regards to you. Uncle Quincy, too, sends his love to you. He is very good 
to call and see me, and so have many other of my 
friends been. Colonel Warren and lady were here on 
Monday, and send their love to you. The Colonel 
promised to write. Mrs. Warren will spend a day or 
two, on her return, with me. I told Betsey to write 
to you ; she says she would, if you were her husband. 
</p><p>
Your mother sends her love to you ; and all your 
family, too numerous to name, desire to be remembered. You will receive letters from two, who are 
as earnest to write to papa, as if the welfare of a kingdom depended upon it. If you can give any 
guess, within a month, let me know when you think of returning. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
