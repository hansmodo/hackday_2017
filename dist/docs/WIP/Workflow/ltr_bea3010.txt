DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The foregoing is a copy of my last by the two Indians you 
sent by express the 29th ultimo, who, I hear this moment, are 
taken five leagues above this ; since which, I have waited two 
or three days for the rear to come up, and in preparing ladders, 
&c. The winds have been so high, these three nights, that I 
have not been able to cross the river. I have near forty canoes 
ready ; and, as the wind has moderated, I design crossing this 
evening. The Hunter sloop, and Lizard frigate, lie opposite to 
prevent us ; but I make no doubt I shall be able to avoid 
them. I this moment received the agreeable intelligence, via 
Sorel, that you are in possession of St. John s, and have invested 
<a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I can give no intelligence, save that the merchant 
ships are busy, day and night, in loading, and four have already 
sailed. I am yours, &c., 
</p><p>
