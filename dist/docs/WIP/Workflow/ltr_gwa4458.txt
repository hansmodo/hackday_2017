My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I have received your several letters, and am extremely concerned at the temper of your detachment, and the desertions that are taking place. I imagine 
however that these would have been nearly as great in any other corps that might have been sent, and, after the Pennsylvania line, I think it would be ineligible to 
detach any other State line. We learn by experience, that they are not only dissipated on the march, but, being at a great distance from their States, are almost 
entirely neglected. Few recruits are raised for thera, and these few are lost on the way. We see how totally the Maryland line has declined, and how little is 
doing to reestablish it ; a line formerly among the most numerous and respectable in the army. Our plan at present appears to me to be to commit the defence of 
the southern States to the States as far as Pennsylvania inclusive, and to make up by detachment any additional succours, that may be necessary. We must 
endeavour to compensate these detachments for the loss of State supplies by giving them a larger proportion of Continental. On this principle I am sending to 
you the articles mentioned in the enclosed list ; twelve hundred shirts, twelve hundred linen overalls, twelve hundred pairs of shoes, twelve hundred pairs of socks, 
and one hundred hunting-shirts, which set out two days ago from this place. I have also urged the Board of War to do their best for you. 
</p><p>
Colonel Vose shall be relieved. If there is any good 
officer of an eastern line here desirous of the command, he must have it. I mentioned to you, that I had a warm remonstrance soon after your departure 
from the Massachusetts line, on the manner of appointing officers for your corps. If there should be no officer of the proper rank desirous of the command, I 
shall be glad to employ Lieutenant-Colonel Smith. I will see what can be done in the case of Major Galvan. I wish at all events to retain Gimat ; but it will be 
difficult to remove the one without the other. 
</p><p>
It appears to me extraordinary, that your ad\ices 
should have given you an idea so different from the 
whole complexion of the intelligence I had received, 
concerning the probability of a certain event. This, 
and the situation of our own force, have induced me 
to regard it as barely possible ; too precarious to enter 
far into our dispositions ; possible only in a case, which 
we are not authorized to expect will happen. I dare 
not trust the details on which this opinion is founded 
to paper. 
</p><p>
The danger to the southern States is immediate and 
pressing. It is our duty to give them support. The 
detachment with you, all circumstances considered, was 
the most proper for the purpose. The project, which 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> has lately adopted, adds a particular 
motive to continuing its destination. It is essential to 
him, that Phillips should be held in check ; and we 
cannot wholly rely on militia for this. As to a transportation by water, while the enemy command the 
Chesapeake and Cape Fear, I do not see how it is 
practicable. The only cause of hesitation in my mind, 
about sending your corps to the southward, w^as a 
separation from you. I refer you to private letters 
accompanying this, one written previously to your last, 
the other subsequently. As to our force here, you 
know what it was when you left us, and you will know 
what it is now, when I tell you that we have as yet 
but few recruits. The enemy's present force of regular troops at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is near seven thousand. I 
shall recommend Major Macpherson, as you request, 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>. Present my warmest thanks to 
that officer and assure him of the sense I have of his 
services. 
</p><p>
You were right, my dear Marquis, in supposing that 
no explanation could be necessary as to your letter to 
the Board of War. I know your sentiments and your 
friendship. I shall not detain the express to enlarge 
on the other subjects of your letters. I will embrace 
the first safe opportunity to give you a full view of 
our affairs, what we are, and what we expect to be, 
that you may regulate your future correspondence with 
your court accordingly. Hitherto I could give you 
nothing material, more than you know, as to ourselves. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Marquis, &,c.
