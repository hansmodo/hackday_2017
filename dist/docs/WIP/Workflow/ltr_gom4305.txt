Sir, 
</p><p>
Herewith I have the honor to transmit a duplicate 
of my last letter, of the 13th of April Not having 
heard from the Duke of Leeds, I wrote him a note 
on the 19th. To this I received no reply; wherefore, 
on the 29th, I addressed him again by a letter, of 
which a copy is inclosed. This was delivered at his 
office, Whitehall, between eleven and twelve in the 
morning of the 29th ; and at half past ten in the 
evening the letters were sent to me. You will observe that his letter is dated the 28th, and of course 
takes no notice of that to which it is in fact the answer; but the style and general complexion, as 
well as the circumstances attending the delivery of it, clearly show that it was not written until the evening of the 29th. 
</p><p>
I might, in reply, have made some strictures upon 
the information that I was in Holland, &c., &c. I 
might also have contrasted the expressions of good 
faith with the conduct of the Administration, and have 
observed upon the idea that the United States were 
bound in the most solemn manner, while, from the 
subsequent parts of his letter, it would seem that 
Great Britain is not bound at all, or at most but 
loosely. There is also a confusion of language, which 
resembles the stammering of one who endeavours to 
excuse a misdeed, which he resolves to commit. Thus, 
on the supposition that completion of the treaty by 
us is impossible, he insists that we shall complete it, 
or make compensation. The expressions in the last 
clause are, if possible, more vague than all the rest. 
and the reply might have been proportionately more 
pointed. 
</p><p>
My letter of yesterday contains nothing of what is 
just stated, although perhaps it ought to have noticed 
some parts. I must rely on your kindness, Sir, both 
to interpret favorably what I have done, and to excuse my omissions. I thought it best to heap coals 
of fire on their heads, and thereby either bring them 
into our views, or put them most eminently in the 
wrong. It was, moreover, my wish to draw forth 
specific propositions, because these will admit of discussion, or else, if manifestly unjust, they may not 
only be repelled, but they will serve to show a predetermined breach of faith by them, which will justify whatever conduct we may afterwards find it proper to adopt. If, as is not improbable, they should 
give us no answer, or one so vague as to mean nothing, I shall pursue, according to circumstances, my 
object of compelling them to speak plainly, or refuse 
absolutely. 
</p><p>
It seems pretty clear, that they wish to evade a 
commercial treaty, but not peremptorily to reject it; 
and, therefore, I have construed into rejection his 
Grace's abstruse language, leaving him the option to 
give it a different interpretation. I do not expect 
that he will, though he may perhaps write an explanatory comment, more unintelligible than the text. 
</p><p>
I have some reason to believe, that the present 
Administration intend to keep the posts and withhold 
payment for the negroes. If so, they will color their 
breach of faith by the best pretexts in their power. 
I incline to think, also, that they consider a treaty 
of commerce with America as being absolutely unnecessary, and that they are persuaded they shall 
derive all the benefit from our trade, without treaty. 
It is true that we might lay them under restrictions 
in our ports; hut they believe that an attempt of 
that sort would be considered by one part of America 
as calculated by the other for private emolument, 
and not for the general good. The merchants here 
look on it as almost impossible for us to do without 
them; and it must be acknowledged that past experience, and the present situation of neighbouring countries, go far to justify that opinion. Whether the 
Ministers shall act according to their own ideas, or 
consult mercantile people, they will equally, I think, 
repel advances from us ; and, therefore, it seems more 
prudent to lay the foundations of future advantage, 
than attempt to grasp at present benefit. I will not 
pretend to suggest any measures for the adoption of 
Congress, whose wisdom and whose sense of national 
honor will certainly lead them to act properly, when 
the proper moment shall present itself It will naturally strike every mind, that while the Legislature of 
this country continues to invest the Executive authority with great power respecting the American commerce, the Administration here will have advantages 
in treaty, which can only be balanced by similar confidence, on the part of Congress, in the Executive of 
America. 
</p><p>
But very much will, I think, depend upon the situation of France. If appearances there should change, 
and so much vigor be infused into the Government 
as would enable it to call forth the national efforts 
in support of their interest and honor, a great revolution would be produced in the opinions here. From 
the conduct of the aristocratic hierarchy in the Low 
Countries, who are instigated and supported by Prussia, I have long been thoroughly convinced that the 
alternative of war, or the most ignominious terms of 
peace, would be proposed to the Imperial Courts. 
Counting upon the absolute nullity of France, and 
supposing that this country can at any moment intimidate that into abject submission, Prussia and Poland will, I think, join themselves to Turkey and 
Sweden against Russia and Austria, which are both 
exhausted, and one of them dismembered. Probably 
the war will be commenced before this letter reaches 
your hands ; and then Britain and Holland are to be 
the umpires, or rather dictators, of peace. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to touch thus far upon 
the general system of European politics, as it may 
tend to show that, for the present. Great Britain will 
rather keep things in suspense with us, being herself 
in a state of suspense as to others. I will not go 
into conjectures about the events which will take 
place upon the Continent. They will, I believe, as 
is usual, disappoint the projectors ; but, be that as it 
may, our affairs can derive no advantages now from 
what shall happen hereafter. I presume that a dissolution of Parliament will take place shortly, although many of the best informed people think, or 
at least say they think, otherwise. But it is clear 
to my mind, that the Administration will wish to 
have before them a prospect of seven years' stability 
to their system, be that what it may; and they will 
not, at the moment of a general election, expose 
themselves to criticism by any act of doubtful construction. This forms with them an additional reason 
for being evasive in regard to us. Perhaps there 
never was a moment in which this country felt herself greater, and consequently it is the most unfavorable moment to obtain advantageous terms from her 
in any bargain. But this appearance is extremely fallacious. Their revenue is not yet equal to their expenditure. Money is indeed poured in upon them from 
all quarters, because of the distracted situation of affairs among their neighbours ; and hence their stocks 
have risen greatly since the peace, so that they can 
borrow at an interest of four per cent. But, supposing they should not be obliged to engage in the war, 
still there are two events, either of which would 
overturn the fabric of their prosperity. If France 
establishes a solid system of finance, then capitalists 
will prefer five per cent, with her to four per cent, 
from Britain ; for, all other things being equal, there 
is no shadow of comparison between the resources of 
the two countries. If France commits a bankruptcy, 
the disorders consequent thereon will doubtless be 
violent; but, the storm once passed, she would be 
able to make greater exertions, by her annual resources, than Britain could compass by every possible anticipation of credit. There is a middle situation, between sinking and swimming, in which the 
French finances may flounder on for some time to 
come, but even this state of wretchedness will produce rather evil than good to Great Britain ; for she 
has already reaped all the harvest which could be 
gathered from the distress of her neighbours, and 
must necessarily lose the benefits of the famous commercial treaty, in proportion as the resources of her customer are cut off.

Under the various contingencies which present 
themselves to my contemplation, and there are many 
which I will not trouble you with the perusal of, it 
appears clearly, that the favorable moment for us to 
treat is not yet come. It is indeed the moment for 
this country, and they seem determined to let it pass 
away. I must again entreat your indulgence. Sir, for 
this long and desultory letter. Accept, I pray you, the assurances of that respect with which I have the
