MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE no letter this week, and begin to fear that 
your respect to our late President has laid a foundation for a sick spring and summer. Sometimes, too, 
I am jealous of unfair play in the post office to pre 
vent me from hearing from you at the most critical 
period of my life. The public papers must give you 
an account of proceedings which I am wholly unable 
to describe. What judgment is formed of my part 
in the late transactions by my friends or my enemies, 
I know not. There is a reserve in both, beyond my 
comprehension. 
</p><p>
The President and Mrs. Washington go off this 
morning for <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. Yesterday afternoon he 
came to make me his farewell visit, and requested 
me, in his own name and Mrs. W.'s, to present 
" their respects" to <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='spouse met friend'>Mrs. Adams</a>. I believe that I 
envied him more than he did me, and with reason. 
The house is to be cleared and cleaned, and I am 
to go into it on Monday next, if possible. I shall 
make a small establishment for myself, for the present, and wait your advice for ulterior arrangements. 
It is now generally understood that I am to go home 
before midsummer and bring my family in October. 
The business of all kinds, and writing particularly, 
out of the habit of which I have been so long, press 
upon me very severely, and would endanger my 
health, if I did not make conscience of riding every 
day. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Gushing will call upon you, and give you an 
account of what they call the inauguration. It is the 
general report that there was more weeping than 
there has ever been at the representation of any 
tragedy. But whether it was from grief or joy, 
whether from the loss of their beloved President, or 
from the accession of an unbeloved one, or from the 
pleasure of exchanging Presidents without tumult, or 
from the novelty of the thing, or from the sublimity 
of it arising from the multitude present, or whatever 
other cause, I know not. One thing I know, I am a 
being of too much sensibility to act any part well in 
such an exhibition. Perhaps there is little danger of 
my having such another scene to feel or behold. 
</p><p>
The stillness and silence astonishes me. Every 
body talks of the tears, the full eyes, the streaming 
eyes, the trickling eyes, &c., but all is enigma beyond. No one descends to particulars to say why or 
wherefore ; I am, therefore, left to suppose that it is 
all grief for the loss of their beloved. Two or three 
persons have ventured to whisper in my ear that my 
speech made an agreeable impression. I have ventured to say things both in that speech and in my fare 
well address to the Senate, so open to scoffs and sarcasms that I expected them in abundance. I have 
not yet seen any. The more may come. I have 
been so strangely used in this country, so belied and 
so undefended, that I was determined to say some 
things as an appeal to posterity. Foreign nations and 
future times will understand them better than my enemies or friends will own they do. The vanity and 
egotism which is so apparent, or at least to seeming, 
may be pardoned for what I know, lest satirical re 
flections on it, should provoke some one to produce 
proofs that if it is egotism, it is no vanity. 
</p><p>
My dear wife, your society is invaluable to me, 
and yet I cannot enjoy it before July, I fear. All will 
depend upon public events. I shall come to you as 
soon as possible. I am, with an affection that can 
end only with my life, and I hope not then, your 
faithful friend and husband, 
</p><p>
