Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I once more put pen to paper, not to attempt, what is 
absolutely beyond the power of language to paint, my distressed situation here, totally destitute of intelligence or 
instructions from you since I left America, except Mr Morris' 
letters of the 4th and 5th of June last, covering duplicates 
of my first instructions. Nor will I complain for myself, but 
must plainly inform you, that the cause of the United Colonies or United States has, for some time, suffered at this 
court for want of positive orders to me, or some other person. 
</p><p>
It has not suffered here only, but at several other courts, that are not only willing, but even desirous of assisting 
America. Common complaisance, say they, though they 
want none of our assistance, requires that they should announce to us inform their being Independent States, that we 
may know how to treat their subjects and their property in our dominions. Every excuse, which my barren invention 
could suggest, has been made, and I have presented memoir after memoir on the situation of American affairs, and their 
importance to this kingdom, and to some others. My representations, as well verbally as written, have been favorably 
received, and all the attention paid them I could have wished, but the sine qua non is wanting, — a power to treat from the 
United Independent States of America. How, say they, is it possible, that all your intelligence and instructions should 
be intercepted, when we daily have advice of American vessels arriving in different ports in Europe 9 It is true I have 
effected what nothing but the real desire this court has of giving aid could have brought about, but at the same time it 
has been a critical and delicate affair, and has required all 
attention to save appearances, and more than once have I been on the brink of losing all, from suspicions that you were 
not in earnest in making applications here. I will only add, that a vessel with a commission from the Congress has 
been detained in Bilboa as a pirate, and complaint against it carried to the court of Madrid. I have been applied to 
for assistance, and though I am in hopes nothing will be determined against us, yet I confess I tremble to think how 
important a question is by this step agitated, without anyone 
empowered to appear in a proper character and put in a defence. Could T present your Declaration of Independence, 
and shew my commission subsequently, empowering me to appear in your behalf, all might be concluded at once, and 
a most important point gained, — no less than that of obtaining a free reception, and defence or protection of our ships 
of war in these ports. 
</p><p>
I have written heretofore for twenty thousand hogsheads 
of tobacco. I now repeat my desire, and for a large quantity of rice. The very profits on a large quantity of these 
articles will go far towards an annual expense. The stores, concerning which I have repeatedly written to you, are now 
shipping, and will be with you I trust in January, as will the 
officers coming with them. I refer to your serious consideration the enclosed hints respecting a naval force in these 
seas, also the enclosed propositions which were by accident thrown in my way. If you shall judge them of any consequence you will lay them before Congress ; if not, postage will be all the expense extra. I believe they have been seen 
by other persons, and therefore I held it my duty to send them to you. My most profound respect and highest 
esteem ever attend the Congress, and particularly the Secret Committee. 
</p><p>
I am, Gentlemen, he.

P. S. Doctor Bancroft has been so kind as to pay me a 
second visit, and that most seasonably, as my former assistant Mr Carmichael has gone to Amsterdam, and thence 
northward on a particular affair of very great importance. The vessel referred to is commanded by Captain Lee, of 
<a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a>, who on his passage took five prizes of value, and sent them back, but brought on two of die Captains and 
some of the men prisoners to Bilboa, where the Captains entered their protest, and complained against Captain Lee 
as a pirate, on which his vessel is detained, and his commission, &cc. sent up to Madrid. this instantly brings on a 
question, as to the legality of the commissions; if determined legal, a most important point is gained ; if the reverse, the 
consequences will be very bad, and the only ground on which the determination can go against the Captain, is that the 
United States of America, or their Congress, are not known in Europe, as being Independent States, otherwise than 
by common fame in newspapers, &:c. ; on which a serious resolution cannot be grounded. The best, therefore, that 
the Captain expects will be to get the matter delayed, which is very hard on the brave Captain and his honest owners, 
and will be a bad precedent for others, who may venture into the European seas. I have done every tiling in my power, 
and am in hopes from the strong assurances given me, that all will be settled to my satisfaction in this affair, but cannot 
but feel on the occasion as well for the Captain as for the public. I have been told repeatedly I was too anxious, and advised " rester sans inquietude," but I view this as a capital affair in its consequences, and though I wish it, I cannot take advice. 
</p><p>
Warlike preparations are daily making in this kingdom and in Spain ; in the latter immediately against the Portuguese, but they will most probably in their consequences 
involve other powers. I need not urge the importance of immediate remittances towards paying for the large quantity 
of stores I have engaged for, and depend this winter will not be suffered to slip away unimproved. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, fee.
