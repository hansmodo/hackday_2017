My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have been wanting for some days past to go and talk with you; but I presume that I must pay the penalty of 
my notoriety by abstaining from being in Washington just now, and accordingly I write what I would much rather say. What I wanted to speak of was 
</p><p>
1. Texas. 
</p><p>
I mentioned when you were here, the intention of that Govt. to withdraw its application for admission into the 
Union. That is now done, and it is very important that the President in his message should speak kindly and if possible 
cordially about that country, intimating that this withdrawal does not abate any of our good feelings towards 
Texas, and that we wish her prosperity. One kind word might do her good ; and that word may now be hazzarded with 
out much risk, for I have reason to know that it will be repeated and approved by some of the most prominent leaders 
of the opposition. I wish therefore you would see that the message is kindly on that point. 
</p><p>
The other matter was 
</p><p>
2. That part of the message which relates to money. I do 
hope that he will not vamp this worn out foolery of <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel='colleague'>Mr Calhoun</a>, and say any more about the Sub Treasury. The coun 
try is disgusted with the subject, It cannot possibly do any good to the country, it will do great harm to Mr Van 
Buren ; and if he will only say nothing about it we may get along very well; but if we are to have any more such 
nauseous stuff, men now well disposed to the President will be alienated, and it will not be easy to forsee all the consequences. 
</p><p>
Now upon these two matters I pray you to take order. You are politically responsible for the acts of this administration; you may be personally responsible for the next administration, if you do not permit these experiments to be continued.
