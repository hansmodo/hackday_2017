My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of 
the 18th inst which revived a great many agreeable recollections. In regard to the establishment of a Branch at Port 
land nothing is as yet decided but should it take place the policy of the Bank has been in the appointment of confidential Officers to live at a distance and to execute such 
important trusts to take in preference Officers brought up in the Bank under our own eye whose character &amp; conduct 
are known to us and afford the best guarantee of their capacity to carry into effect the system of the Bank with which 
they are familiar. I have long been satisfied that this is the true policy of the Bank and I think it will be pursued in case 
a Branch is established at Portland. The observation applies of course only to the Cashier. The other Officers are appointed 
by the Directors of the Branch. This is all that I can say at present and although it would be more agreeable to me personally to offer to your nephew more favorable prospects yet this candid explanation is due to you.
