Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter gave me great pleasure, and the more, as it 
leads me to expect that of seeing you here when a favourable opportunity shall offer. 
</p><p>
I apprehend that several of your remarks relative to 
public affairs are too well founded ; and it is natural that 
they should be so. The operations of certain principles 
and passions are nearly alike in all ages and countries. 
</p><p>
Every modification of sovereignty has its inconveniences - there is a better and a worse in them all, and no other 
than a relative perfection in any of them. That ours might 
be rendered less imperfect is more easy to prove than to 
accomplish. It is true, that when the measure of confusion 
runs over, order usually follows ; but it is not always such 
order as would please either you or me. 
</p><p>
The vices and violences of parties, mid the corruptions 
which they generate and cherish, are serious evils ; but 
they are evils which, during the full tide of democracy, 
mere reason will find it difficult to correct, because the 
majority of every people are deficient both in virtue and in 
knowledge. All parties have their demagogues, and demagogues never were nor will be patriots. Self-interest excites and directs all their talents and industry, and by that 
principle they regulate their conduct towards men and 
measures : nor is this all ; they not only act improperly 
themselves, but they diligently strive to mislead the weak, 
the ignorant, and the unwary ; as to the corrupt, they like 
to have it so ; it makes a good market for them. 
</p><p>
Reforms in government are more frequently imposed by overbearing circumstances, than produced by the influence 
of wisdom on the opinion and choice of the multitude. The administration of every government will always be 
able, virtuous, and salutary, or otherwise, according to the characters of those to whom it may be committed. The rulers in democratic republics are generally men of more 
talents than morals ; there can be but little connexion between cunning and virtue, and therefore (except now and 
then in particular instances) our affairs will commonly be 
managed by political intrigues, calculated upon that " auri 
fames" which, from obvious causes, rages in this country. 
</p><p>
New men, new objects, and now designs, will successively arise and have their day ; but whether for good or 
for evil, we know not. At present, democracy prevails 
too much ; the time may come when it will prevail too 
little. The human passions naturally vibrate between extremes, passing and repassing, but seldom stopping at the 
middle point. 
</p><p>
Things are as they are, and we must make the best of 
them ; as travellers do or ought to do, well knowing that 
in the course of a long journey, they cannot expect to 
have every day fine weather, good inns, good roads, and 
good company. Nothing remains for us but to do our 
duty to our country with prudent and unabated zeal ; to 
enjoy with gratitude and cheerfulness the good we have ; 
and to bear with decencv and dignitv the ills which we 
cannot avert or remove. What may be our duty will 
depend on the circumstances of the day. Those of the 
present day appear to me a little singular in some respects.

As to the ensuing election for governor, a federal candidate should, in my opinion, have been named. If that had 
been deemed inexpedient, the federal party should, I think, 
have adopted an unequivocal plain line of conduct relative 
to the present candidates, explicitly deciding to vote for 
neither of them ; or openly resolving to support the one 
whom they considered as the least objectionable. In what 
state the election will place our party, is difficult to conjecture, for although advantages will result from it, yet 
"Timco dona fe rentes." 
</p><p>
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
