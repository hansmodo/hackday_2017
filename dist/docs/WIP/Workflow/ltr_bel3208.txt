MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have received information that, on the 3d instant, 
the enemy landed about eight thousand troops, commanded by Sir Henry Clinton. If this is true, we 
may soon expect them before this town; for they 
probably know that we soon expect reinforcements. 
</p><p>
Two o clock, P. M. I have just received information that a large fleet is off. Matters are fast ripening, and will, I think, soon become very serious. 
</p><p>
Eight o clock. I am told that fifty sail of vessels 
got into North Edisto this day. 
</p><p>
February 13^, three o'clock in the morning. By a 
person just from Edisto, I learn that the number of 
vessels in at the harbour there is a little short of fifty. 
</p><p>
I am collecting the troops, and posting them in 
and near this town, saving the light-horse, and two 
hundred light troops. Those are in the southern 
part of the State, left with a view to hang on the 
enemy's left flank, should they attempt to march 
across land, and prevent the small parties strolling 
into the country, plundering, and distressing the in 
habitants. I am, my dear General, with the highest esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
