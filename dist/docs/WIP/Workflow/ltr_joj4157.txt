Sir, 
</p><p>
On my return from New-York on Friday last, your 
obliging letter of the 5th of May, which arrived here during 
my absence, was delivered to me. I am much gratified by 
the information it contains, and thank you for it. 
</p><p>
Serious apprehensions were entertained that anti-federalism had gained considerable ground in Massachusetts, but 
I am happy to find from the facts you state, that appearances do not warrant the conclusions which have been 
drawn from them.

The present aspect of our affairs is far from being agreeable. Although peculiarly blessed, and having abundant 
reason for content and gratitude, our nation is permitting 
their happiness to be put in jeopardy by the worst passions, 
inflamed and directed by the most reprehensible means. 
Whether the good sense of the people will avert the dangers which threaten them, is yet to be seen. If the sound 
and leading friends of their country could concur in opinion 
as to men and measures, their efforts would probably be 
successful ; but unfortunately, there is too little unanimity in 
many points, and the want of it exposes us to the hazard 
of many evils.

It really appears to me that the mission of our envoys to 
France has been treated with too much asperity. The 
president declared to the Congress that he would never 
send another legation to Paris, until he received assurances 
that it would be properly respected. As that declaration 
seemed to imply that when he should receive such assurances he would again send envoys, it was not unnatural 
that he should conceive himself bound in honour to do so. 
This attachment to the dictates of honour and good faith, 
even supposing it to have been too scrupulous, is amiable 
and praiseworthy. Whether that declaration was advisable, 
and whether the nomination of the envoys was made exactly in season, are questions which, like others of the same 
kind, may receive different answers from different men ; 
but having nominated the envoys and received the requisite 
assurances, I, for my part, consider the sending them as a 
matter of course, and I do not concur in opinion with those 
gentlemen who think they should nevertheless have been 
detained. 
</p><p>
I regret that my absence deprived me of the pleasure of 
seeing the Rev. Mr. Andrews, and the more so, as he 
would have answered my inquiries respecting many of my 
friends at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and informed me of your health. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes that you may now and long enjoy 
that valuable blessing, I am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
