TO MESHECH WEARE, PRESIDENT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.

Sir,
</p><p>
I regret being obliged to inform your Excellency, that I find myself at this late period very little stronger than I was when the army first moved out of their 
quarters. I leave your Excellency to judge of the delicate and embarrassed situation in which I stand at 
this moment. Unable to advance with prudence beyond my present position, while perhaps in the general 
opinion my force is equal to the commencement of operations against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, my conduct must appear, if not Ijlamable, highly mysterious at least. Our allies, 
with whom a junction has been formed upwards of three weeks, and who were made to expect, from the engagements which I entered into with them at Weathersfield in May last, a very considerable augmentation 
of our force by this time, instead of seeing a prospect 
of advancing, must conjecture, upon good grounds, that 
the campaign will waste fruitlessly away. I shall just 
remark, that it will be no small degree of triumph to 
our enemies, and will have a very pernicious influence 
upon our friends in Europe, should they find such a failure of resource, or such a want of energy to draw It out, that our boasted and expensive preparations end only in idle parade. 
</p><p>
I cannot yet but persuade myself, and I do not 
cease to encourage our allies with the hope, that our 
force will still be sufficient to carry our intended operation into effect ; or, if we cannot fully accomplish 
that, to oblige the enemy to withdraw part of their force 
from the southward to support <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, which, as I 
informed you in my letter from Weathersfield, was part 
of our plan. Your Excellency must be sensible, that 
the fulfilment of my engagements must depend upon 
the degree of vigor, with which the executives of the 
several States exercise the powers with which they 
have been vested, and enforce the laws lately passed 
for filling up and supplying the army. In full confidence that the means, which have been voted, will be 
obtained, I shall continue my preparations ; but I must take the liberty of informing you, that it is essentially necessary I should be made acquainted, immediately 
upon the receipt of this, with the number of Continental levies and militia, that have been forwarded, and 
what are the prospects of obtaining the remainder. I will t'lirthcr ackl, that it will be equally necessary to see that the monthly i|Ui)ta of provision, stipulated at the 
meeting of the connnissioners at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, is regularly complied with. I have the honor to be, &,c.
