Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honoured with yours of the 31st of last month. 
The article in the treaty, to which you allude, viz. the last, was proposed by me to <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>, because it seemed 
probable that when the treaty should for some time have 
been in operation, defects might become manifest, and further arrangements become desirable, which had not occurred 
to either of us ; because no plan of an article relative to 
impressments, which we could devise, was so free from 
objections as to meet with mutual approbation ; and because 
the lord-chancellor's proposed article, relative to alienism 
and other interesting objects, was of such magnitude, that I 
did not think any stipulations respecting them should be 
ventured, until after that article had received the most 
mature consideration of our government. 
</p><p>
I think that in endeavouring to obtain a new modification 
of the 12th article, an extension of tonnage, from 70 to 100 
tons, should be attempted : for although this was strenuously pressed before, yet I can see no inconvenience in 
repeating it, by way of experiment â€” not insisting on it as 
an ultimatum. In my opinion, it would also be expedient 
that the new article should specify the particular commodities which our vessels shall be permitted to carry from the 
United States to the British islands, and import from the 
latter into the former. 
</p><p>
As to the impressment of seamen, the forming of any a ery 
satisfactory arrangement on that head will, I fear, continue 
to prove an arduous task. In my opinion, Great Britain, 
should at present agree not to take any seamen from our 
vessels on the ocean, or in her colonial ports, on account of 
the injuries thence resulting to our navigation. It would be 
difficult to support the position, that she ought to agree not 
to seek for and take her own seamen, on board of any 
merchant vessel in the ports of Great Britain or Ireland. 
</p><p>
In the India, or 13th article, " It is expressly agreed, that 
the vessels of the United States shall not carry any of the 
articles, exported by them from the said British territories, 
to any port or place, except to some port or place in America, where the same shall be unladen." I would propose, 
that after the word America, be added, or to some foreign 
port or -place in Asia. There is, indeed, nothing in the 
article as it now stands, which restrains the India Company's government from continuing to permit our vessels to 
carry cargoes from India to China; but it would be better, 
if possible, to establish this as a right by express agreement. 
</p><p>
For my own part, 1 regard the present moment as unfavourable for negotiations with Great Britain. Although 
she has reason not only to approve, but to admire the conduct of our government, yet while it appears doubtful to 
her, whether the sentiments and dispositions of the great 
body of our people are pacific and friendly, or otherwise, it 
seems natural to suppose that it will be her policy to be 
reserved. To multiply engagements with, and facilities to 
us under such circumstances, might be ascribed to her apprehensions ; and as her government will doubtless perceive 
this risk, I suspect they will be strongly inclined to avoid it. 
</p><p>
Besides, I should doubt the policy of introducing into the 
negotiation atpnscnt, either so many or such propositions 
as may defer the ultimate ratification so late, as to prevent 
orders to evacuate the posts by the 1st of June next, from 
being sent in due season. 
</p><p>
The commercial part of the treaty may be terminated at 
the expiration of two years after the war ; and in the mean 
time, a state of things more auspicious to negotiation will 
probably arrive, especially if the next session of Congress 
should not interpose new obstacles. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your faithful friend and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
