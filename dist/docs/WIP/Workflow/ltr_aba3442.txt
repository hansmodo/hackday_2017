MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of February 12th, as 
well as one, by Mr. Storer, of February 2d. I have 
been every day since thinking that I would write to 
you, but a superior duty has occupied all my time 
for six weeks past. I have been only two davs 
(when I was too sick to attend) absent from the 
sick bed of your grandmother. Your desire, that 
her last days might be rendered as comfortable as it 
is possible to make them, has been fulfilled. There 
has been no attention on my part, nor any comfort 
in my power to render her, that she has one moment 
wanted. She had spent a day with me the week 
she was taken sick. A severe storm had prevented 
me from hearing from her for a couple of days. I 
then learnt that she had a violent cold, as it was 
supposed. I went immediately to see her, and 
found her sick with a lung fever. Her granddaughters have been affectionate, tender, and watchful of her, but she has lived all the days of her appointed time, and is now ready to depart. Her 
senses are bright and quick, her hearing better than 
for years past. Upon looking back she has no regrets ; upon looking forward she has all hope and 
comfort. Her hourly wish is to be at rest. She 
took her leave of me this evening, with her blessing 
upon me and mine to the latest posterity. I told her 
to-day that you desired to be remembered to her. 
She asked me if I thought there was any thing, 
which she had, that you would accept of. 1 answered, that what she had I thought her granddaughters, 
who were with her, deserved, and that I was sure 
you would value her blessing more than any thing 
else. " Well," she replied, " I pray God to bless 
her and her children ; and tell all who belong to me 
to consider, that a virtuous and a religious life is the 
only solid comfort upon a death-bed." She has 
mourned much, since her sickness, that she should 
never see your father again ; but she now seems 
reconciled to the thought of her approaching dissolution, which cannot be far distant. She has no rest, 
night nor day, her cough is so constant and troublesome ; and she can take scarcely any nourishment. 
If she had reached the 17th of this month, she would 
have been eighty-five years old. I can say with Pope 
upon a similar occasion, " that my constant attendance upon her has indeed affected my mind very 
much, and lessened my desire of long life, since the 
best that can come of it is a miserable benediction." 
" Nothing," says Seneca, " is so melancholy a circumstance in human life, or so soon reconciles us to 
the thought of our own death, as the reflection and 
prospect of one friend after another dropping around 
us. Who would stand alone, the sole remaining 
ruin, the last tottering column of all the fabric of 
friendship, seemingly so strong, once so large, and 
yet so suddenly sunk and buried ? "

Present me kindly to all my friends. In some 
future letter I may notice several things in yours ; 
but my mind is too much solemnized by the scene 
before me to add any thing more, than that I am 
</p><p>
Your affectionate mother, 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
