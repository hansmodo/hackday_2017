My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have purposely delayed answering your favor of the 11th of Sept'r until I could speak with some degree of confidence as to the course which will be adopted in reference to the 
subject of it. In the mean time I have read repeatedly and with renewed interest all your remarks, proceeding as I know 
they do from one who with ample materials of information &amp; great sagacity in employing them gives the result of his 
reflections with a sincere desire to serve the institution. For this in any event you will accept my grateful thanks. 
</p><p>
After keeping the subject long under advisement in order to observe the latest development of facts, I am now satisfied, that it would be inexpedient to apply at present for the 
renewal of the charter. My belief is from all I have seen &amp; read &amp; heard, that there is at this moment a majority of both 
Houses of Congress favourable to a renewal, and moreover that the President would not reject the bill. The temptation is therefore great to take advantage of a propitious state of feelings like this. But then the Hazard is not to be disguised. 
A great mass of those who if they were obliged to vote at all would vote favourably will prefer not voting if it can be 
avoided, and the dread of responsibility, the love of postponment &amp; the vis-inertia inherent in all legislative bodies would 
combine to put off the question during the approaching 
short session. To pass both houses &amp; be rejected by the President, to be rejected in either house, to be postponed in either 
house, to be brought forward in any shape and not be finally 
and favorably acted upon are degrees of evil but the mildest of them a great evil, much to be deplored &amp; to be avoided 
if possible. My impression then is that nothing but a certainty of success should induce an application now. To this 
I am the more inclined because time is operating in favor of the Bank, by removing prejudices, and diffusing a general 
conviction of its utility. 
</p><p>
Having made up my mind on the subject, I am gratified that this, which is the first expression I have made of this 
opinion, should be communicated to one whose views have so largely influenced my own. It will always afford me great 
pleasure to receive the benefit of your further suggestions on this or any other subject, being with great respect and regard 
</p>
