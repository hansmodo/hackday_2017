My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
This letter is not by any means directed to the 
Commander-in-chief, but to my most intimate and longcherished friend. I will lay before you my circumstances and my wishes. Certain I am you will do 
whatever you can for me, that is consistent with your 
public duty. 
</p><p>
When I went to the southward, you know I had 
some private objections. But I became sensible of 
the necessity there was for the detachment to go, 
and I knew that, had I returned, there was nobody 
that could lead them on against their inclinations. 
My entering this State was happily marked by a 
service to the capital. Virginia became the grand 
object of the enemy, as it was the point to which the 
Ministry tended. I had the honor to command an 
army, and oppose Lord Cornwallis. When incomparably inferior to him, fortune was pleased to preserve 
us ; when equal in numbers, though not in kind of 
troops, we have also been pretty lucky. Cornwallis 
had the disgrace of a retreat, and this State being 
recovered, Government is properly reestablished. The enemy are under the protection of their works at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
</p><p>
It appears an embarkation is taking place, probably 
destined to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The war in this State would 
then become a plundering one, and great manoeuvres 
be out of the question. A prudent officer would do 
our business here, and the Baron is so to the utmost. 
would it be possible, my dear General, that in case 
a part of the British troops go to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I may 
be allowed to join the combined armies ? I know the 
command of a separate army ought not to be quitted. 
But, besides the services I may render in the cooperation, some arrangements, which I leave to your 
goodness for me to think of, may put me in a very 
brilliant station. 
</p><p>
M. de Choisy, I am told, is very unhappy to be left 
behind. Perhaps these French troops will be replaced 
by militia, which requires a general officer; perhaps 
a corps of observation in the Jerseys will be given 
to another. The militia requires a Major-General, as 
it will be very numerous. Does not <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> 
take command of the Pennsylvania line, and will not 
this line be forwarded to the southward, rather than 
the New England light infantry ? So that, my dear 
General, I hope something may be found for me in 
the Continental part of the army; the more so, as it 
seems it will form one of the divisions of the combined army under your command. 
</p><p>
I have calculated that nothing very material would 
happen before September. By that time your forces 
will be collected, clothed, and arranged ; a succour 
from the West Indies may arrive ; you will then decide if the upper part of the Island, Long Island, 
Staten Island, or <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Island, is to be in our 
possession. This letter goes to-day by a faithful servant. It will arrive on the 29th at camp. Your 
answer might he with me so that I may leave on the 
10th, and arrive at head-quarters about the 20th. 
This matter I have not mentioned to any body, and 
wish it may rest between you and me. Lord Cornwallis is every day inquiring about my going to the 
Grand Army, which he says must be soon the case. 
This induces me to think they believe you are in 
earnest in your preparations. 
</p><p>
The command of this army has been a great matter for me. You may end this campaign of mine in 
the most brilliant manner, by the command I may, 
with some arrangements, get in the combined army. 
The services I may render, with respect to the cooperation, may be a very good reason, and my coming unexpectedly, unless I have many senior officers 
in the way, may entitle me to a great command. 
Should not a great part of the operating army in 
this quarter go to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I would not trouble 
you with my wishes to return to head-quarters. But 
do not, I pray, believe I have the least notion of 
calculating upon commands, though in my personal 
circumstances they become peculiarly important to 
me. If I may be of the least use to you, it will 
make me happy to serve as a volunteer Aid-de-camp 
to you. 
</p><p>
Since writing the inclosed, my dear General, an 
officer of Tarleton's legion, who has been taken, was 
brought to my quarters. He had much conversation 
with my Aids-de-camp, and being an unguarded young 
man, spoke very freely. He says Lord Cornwallis 
and Colonel Tarleton are certainly going to New 
York. He adds, the light infantry, and a regiment 
of horse, do certainly embark for the same place. 
Preference is given to such troops as were the most fatigued in their manoeuvres through Virginia. He 
thinks the guards are to remain here ; does not know 
the disposition of any other troops. I thought this 
was worth mentioning to you. Would to God this 
embarkation could be intercepted !
</p><p>
I have this day seen the order of battle. It appears to me <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> is not comprehended 
in it. The Jersey troops, not being there, are, I presume, destined to a diversion with the New Jersey 
militia. New England, or the whole body of the 
militia, will perhaps furnish some general employment, so that I hope I may be put in, at all events. 
I should be with you, and of course should be very 
happy. 
</p><p>
Should the enemy remain quiet in this State, the 
Baron might do very well. But if the siege of New 
York does not succeed, and there is no place, I imagine you will march here in force. Adieu, my dear 
General. You will not forget this letter is entirely 
private, and by no means directed to the Commander-in-chief With every sentiment of respect, and the 
most tender affection, I have the honor to be, my 
dear General, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. In case there is no appearance of a move 
of the enemy, and no propriety in our going toward 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, I intend reconnoitring the grounds about 
<a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, where, if I am made certain nothing 
will happen in my absence, I may meet your letter.
