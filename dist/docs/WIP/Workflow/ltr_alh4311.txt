Sir, 
</p><p>
I am happy to be able, at length, to send you 
answers to the objections which were communicated 
in your letter of the 29th of July.
</p><p>
They have unavoidably been drawn in haste, too 
much so to do perfect justice to the subject, and 
have been copied just as they flowed from my heart 
and pen, without revision or correction. You will 
observe, that here and there some severity appears. 
I have not fortitude enough always to bear, with 
calmness, calumnies, which necessarily include me as 
a principal agent in the measures censured, of the falsehood of which I have the most unqualified consciousness. I trust that I shall always be able to 
bear, as I ought, imputations of errors of judgment ; 
but I acknowledge that I cannot be entirely patient 
under charges which impeach the integrity of my 
public motives or conduct. I feel that I merit them 
ill no degree; and expressions of indignation sometimes 
escape me, in spite of every effort to suppress them. 
I rely on your goodness for the proper allowances. 
</p><p>
With high respect, and the most affectionate attachment, I have the honor to be. Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
