My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I was obliged to break off abruptly in my last letter 
and send it unfinished. To resume the thread of 
narration will be hardly possible ; indeed it would not 
be worth troubling you with, as you must have heard 
before this time of the principal circumstances of our 
retreat, and the failure of the British disposition. 
Generals Clinton and Howe were both out with the 
whole army, deducting the necessary guards for the 
city. One of the columns executed a march of 35 
miles which proved fatal to several of their plethoric 
soldiers. 
</p><p>
The <a href="/results.php?tla=laf" rel="co-worker friend met">Marquis</a> made a brilliant retreat, and left the 
surrounding enemy to return to the city with precipitation. The firing of our alarm guns at camp, the 
crossing a few troops at Sullivan's bridge, and the 
report of a great number, added to the good order in 
which the detachment retired, saved the flower of our 
army. We have since seen a <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> Gazette in 
which our detachment is called a large body of the 
rebels, their number covered under the appellation of 
a detachment. The Marquis is said to have retreated 
in the greatest confusion, and the party that crossed 
the Schuylkil here are said to have recrossed panic 
struck, and to have taken up the bridge after them. 
In the same Gazette there is a pompous description of 
the medley of entertainments which the city had given 
in testimony of their affection for General Howe ; they 
call it a mischianza (pronounce miskiansa) which 
is an Italian word signifying a medley. 
</p><p>
The most recent intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is, 
that the troops drew yesterday three days provision 
and had their canteens filled with rum, that the 
women and children had embarked, some of the sick 
had been removed from the hospital and bettering 
house, the spare bedding and hospital utensils had 
been shipped, boxes of arms numbered were removing from the arsenal to the vessels. Coffin and Anderson, a capital Tory house, were packing up their 
merchandise. 
</p><p>
The number of transports amounted to 180 vessels, 
averaging 250 tons each. This does not appear 
adequate to the number of troops, &ca., and makes 
us think that the enemy will retreat through the 
Jerseys, after embarking their heavy cannon and 
baggage, the horses belonging to them, their invalids 
and their new levies, whose desertion they have good 
reason to dread. 
</p><p>
We learn farther, that notice was given on Saturday 
to the officers of police, that the army was about 
to remove, and that vessels were prepared for such 
families as should choose to quit the city that there 
was a general despair among the Tory inhabitants 
that the enemy were still at work on their new 
redoubts. 
</p><p>
On Sunday the command devolved to General Clinton. Gen'l Howe took leave of the city and dined 
with his brother on board of the Eagle. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants anxious to know whether their 
persons and property will be protected from the rage 
of the American soldiery if they could be sure of 
protection, it is thought that much valuable merchandise would be retained in the city, which otherwise 
will be sent away. 
</p><p>
The greatest part of this intelligence was given by 
a Mr. Combes, father of the clergyman the old 
gentleman is come out to make his peace and take 
the oath he will be sent back to town, with consolation for repentant sinners. Deserters, townsmen, 
women of different qualities, spies, confirm the sub 
stance of these accounts. There has been such 
diligence used in shipping, that some light carts 
have been drawn by soldiers. Every kind of carriage 
from waggons to wheelbarrows, have been incessantly rolling between the houses and water side for 
some days past. 
</p><p>
It is not certainly known whether they will embark 
or march through the Jerseys ; by the latter method 
of retiring they would avoid the dangers of the sea 
and a French fleet, economize provision and forage, 
be sure of arriving at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> at a given time ; by 
the former they would be secure from desertion, 
and harrassing from such light troops as might be 
detached after them on their march ; but the matter 
is put out of doubt, if what we have just heard from 
Col. Shreve, commandant in Jersey, be true, that 
several troops of the enemy's horse have embarked. 
This being the case, they certainly mean to go by sea, 
as every dragoon that can be mustered would be 
wanted in their march through the Jerseys. 
</p><p>
Col. Shreve adds that the refugees arc daily deserting from Billingsport, and surrendering themselves to 
the civil power, that several companies of artillery 
have embarked. 
</p><p>
The intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is that the enemy 
have abandoned Fort Washington and its dependencies. Whether their design is to concenter their 
force at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and make a stand there, or only 
rendezvous there to proceed elsewhere, or divide the 
force that they have at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, part to go to 
reinforce <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and part for the defence of 
their AV. India islands, cannot be determined. It is 
certain that a notion prevails among the soldiery that many of them are going to the West Indies, and that immense desertion would take place if any opportunity were given. 
</p><p>
God bless yon, my dear father; I salute you with 
</p><p>
my tenderest love.
