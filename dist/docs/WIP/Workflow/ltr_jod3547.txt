MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DARE say there is not a lady in America treated 
with a more curious dish of politics than is contained 
in the enclosed papers. You may show them to dis 
creet friends, but by no means let them go out of your 
hands or be copied. Preserve them in safety against 
accidents. 
</p><p>
I am afraid we shall have another campaign ; but do 
not. despair, however, of a peace this winter. America has nothing to do but to be temperate, patient, 
and faithful to her ally. This is as clearly her duty 
as it is her interest. She could not trust England if 
her honor was not engaged to France, which it is 
most certainly ; and when this is said, all is said. 
Whether there should be peace or war, I shall come 
home in the summer. As soon as I shall receive 
from Congress their acceptance of the resignation of 
all my employments, which I have transmitted many 
ways, I shall embark, and you may depend upon a 
good domestic husband for the remainder of my life, 
if it is the will of heaven that I should once more 
meet you. My promises are not lightly made with 
any body. I have never broken one made to you, 
and I will not begin at this time of life. 
</p><p>
My children, I hope, will once at length discover 
that they have a father, who is not unmindful of their 
welfare. They have had too much reason to think 
themselves forgotten, although I know that an anxiety 
for their happiness has corroded me every day of my 
life. 
</p><p>
With a tenderness which words cannot express, I 
am theirs and yours forever, 
</p><p>
