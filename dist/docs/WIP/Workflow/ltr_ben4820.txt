MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received yours of June 29, by Packet. I am glad to hear 
of all your Welfares, and that the Pictures &c. were safe 
arrived. You do not tell me who mounted the great one, nor 
where you have hung it up. Let me know whether Dr. Bond 
likes the new one better than the old one ; if so, the old one 
is to be returned hither to Mr. Wilson, the Painter. You may 
keep the Frame, as it may be wanted for some other Picture 
there. I wrote to you the Beginning of last Month, to go by 
Capt. Falconer, & have since been in the Country, am just 
come to town, and find him still here, and the Letters not gone. 
He goes however next Saturday.

I had written to many of my Friends by him. I spent three 
Weeks in Hampshire at my Friend the Bishop of St. Asaph's. 
The Bishop's Lady knows what Children and Grandchildren 
I have, their Ages, &c. So when I was to come away on 
Monday the 12th in the Morning, she insisted on my staying 
that one Day longer, that we might together keep my Grandson's Birthday. At Dinner, among other nice Things, we 
had a Floating Island, which they always particularly have on the BirthDays of any of their own Six Children; who 
were all but one at Table, where there was also a Clergyman's 
Widow now above 100 Years old. The chief Toast of the 
Day was Master Benjamin Bache, which the venerable old 
Lady began in a Bumper of Mountain. The Bishop's Lady 
politely added, and that he may be as good a Man as his Grandfather. I said I hop'd he would be much better. The Bishop, 
still more complaisant than his Lady, said, "We will compound the Matter, and be contented if he should not prove 
quite so good." This Chitchat is to yourself only, in return 
for some of yours about your Grandson, and must only be 
read to Sally, and not spoken of to anybody else; for you 
know how People add and alter silly Stories that they hear, 
and make them appear ten times more silly.

Just while I am writing the Post brings me the enclosed 
from the good Bishop, with some Letters of Recommendation for Ireland, to see which Country I am to set out next 
week with my old Friend and Fellow Traveller, Counsellor 
Jackson. We expect to be absent a Month or Six Weeks. 
The Bishop's youngest Daughter, mention'd in his Letter, is 
about 11 years of age, and came up with me in the PostChaise 
to go to her School.

Capt. Osborne is not yet arrived here, but is every day 
expected. I hope he will come before I set out, that I may 
hear from you by him. I desire you will push the enquiry 
after the Lancaster Dutchman, and not let it sleep & be 
forgotten. I send you by Capt. Falconer a Box of Looking Glasses for the Closet Door in the little l
