My dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Last Tuesday evening my wife was delivered of a boy. I communicate that event because I believe it will give you 
pleasure. Moreover, I wish you to be one of his godfathers. True it is, thai according to the usual course, you may not 
be able to perform the duties of that office ; but, my friend should you be mingled with the dust, he shall learn from the 
history of your life, that a man must be truly pious to be truly great. I do not fix the day, because I wish you 
to come on in a fortnight or three weeks, when it best suits your convenience. I will then summon the priest and the other sponsors. 
</p><p>
Yours truly, 
</p><p>
