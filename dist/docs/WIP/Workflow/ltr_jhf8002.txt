Sir: I have this moment received the general order. No. 7, (dated the 17th instant,) making 
known to me the final decision in the proceedings of the general court-martial, before which I 
have been tried ; and hereby send in my resignation of lieutenant-colonel in the army of the United States. 
</p><p>
In doing this, I take the occasion to say that my reason for resigning is that I do not feel conscious of having done anything to merit the 
finding of the court; and, this being the case, I cannot, by accepting the clemency of the President, admit the justice of the decision against me. 
</p><p>
Very respectfully your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
