MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received your kind Letter of March 2, and am glad to 
hear that the Ship from Ireland is got safe into Antigua. I 
hope you will now get the little Token I sent you from thence. 
I have not receiv'd the Letter you mention to have given the 
young Scotsman, nor that from Mr. Craige. 
</p><p>
I am sorry for the Disorder that has fallen on our Friend 
Kinnersley, but hope he will get the better of it. I thank you 
for your Advice about putting back a Fit of the Gout. I 
shall never attempt such a Thing. Indeed I have not much 
occasion to complain of the Gout, having had but two slight 
Fits since I came last to England. I hope Mr. Bache is 
with you and his Family by this Time, as he sailed from the 
Downs the latter End of February. My Love to him and 
Sally, and young Master, who I suppose is Master of the 
House. Tell him, that Billy Hewson is as much thought of 
here as he can be there; was wean'd last Saturday; loves 
musick ; comes to see his Gran-ma ; and will be lifted up to 
knock at the Door himself, as he has done while I was writing 
this at the Request of Mrs. Stevenson, who sends her Love, 
as Sally does her Duty. Thanks to God, I continue well, 
and am, as ever, your affectionate Husband, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
