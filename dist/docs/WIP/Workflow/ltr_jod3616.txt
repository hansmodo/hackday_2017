MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE only time to inform you that Monday and 
Thursday have passed away without bringing me a 
letter from you. It is the first week that has failed 
me in the whole, though sometimes the letters have 
not arrived on the proper day. 
</p><p>
There is a Dr. somebody here from Connecticut, 
who pretends, with an instrument made of some kind 
of metal or composition of metals, by a sort of mesmerian rubbing, or stroking, or conjuration, to cure rheumatisms, headaches, pleurisies, and I know not 
what. Ellsworth will not say that he believes in it, 
but he states facts and tells stories. I expect the 
heads of all the old women, (males I mean, you 
know,) will be turned. They have got him into the 
President's house among some of his servants, and 
Mrs. Washington told me a story on Tuesday, before 
a number of gentlemen, so ineffably ridiculous that I 
dare not repeat it in writing. The venerable lady 
laughed as immoderately as all the rest of us did. 
</p><p>
A barrier is erected between Europe and America. 
It seems as if no vessel could get through or over it. 
I went with Charles last night to the drawing room. 
As the evening was fair and mild, there was a 
great circle of ladies and a greater of gentlemen. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel=''>General Wayne</a> was there in glory. This man's 
feelings must be worth a guinea a minute. The 
Pennsylvanians claim him as theirs, and show him a 
marked respect. 
</p><p>
W T e are now near the middle of February. Last 
year I left this place on the 19th. Now, I must 
stay through the long months of March, <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, 
and May. Long ? Nothing is long ! The time will 
be soon gone, and we shall be surprised to know what 
is become of it. How soon will my sands be all run 
out of the glass ! After sixty, the days and hours 
have additional wings, which they wave and beat 
with increasing rapidity. 
</p><p>
Dr. Priestley is here. I drank tea with him at the 
President's on Thursday evening. He says he always 
maintained against Dr. Price, that old age was the 
pleasantest part of life, and he finds it so. I think so 
too. One knows not what infirmities may come on, 
what pains, griefs or sorrows ? I am determined to 
make my small remainder as easy as I can, and en 
joy the hours as they pass, but do a little good as I 
have opportunity. 
</p><p>
You have not informed me whether you have let 
the farms. Duty and love as usual.
