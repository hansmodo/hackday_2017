My dear Marquis, 
Your favor dated at Elk the 8th instant reached 
me at ten o'clock last evening. While I give you 
credit for the manoeuvre by which you removed the British ships from before <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, I am sorry, as matters are circumstanced, that you have put yourself so 
much further from the point, which now of necessity becomes the object of your destination. Whether 
General Phillip remains in Virginia or goes further 
southward, he must be opposed by a force more substantial than militia alone ; and you will for that reason immediately open a communication with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, inform him of the numbers, situation, and 
probable views of the enemy in Virginia, and take 
his directions as to marching forward to join him, or 
remaining there to keep a watch upon the motions of 
Phillips, should he have formed a junction with Arnold at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
</p><p>
Every difficulty, so far as respects the wants of the officers and men, and the uneasinesses, which might arise upon their being ordered upon a more distant 
service than they expected, were foreseen, and would have been removed by recalling the detachment and 
forming another, had not the reasons of a public nature, which were mentioned in my letter of the 6th, outweighed all private considerations. 
</p><p>
You must endeavour to get shoes from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
which will be essentially necessary before you can 
move ; and, if you will cause a return to be made of 
such articles, as will probably be wanting in the course 
of the campaign, I will endeavour to forward them from 
hence, with a proportion of any stores, which may have 
been sent on by the States for their troops. If the 
officers will write back to their friends here for any 
additional baggage, of which they may stand in need, 
it shall be forwarded under careful conductors. The 
difficulties, which you will experience on the score of 
provision and transportation, would have been common 
to any other body of troops. They will I know be 
great, but I depend much upon your assiduity and 
activity. 
</p><p>
If the most distant prospect of such an operation as 
you speak of had been in my mind, I should have 
looked upon your detachment as essential to the undertaking ; but I can assure you, without entering into 
a detail of reasons, which I cannot commit to paper, 
that I have not at present an idea of being able to 
effect such a matter. This had very great weight in 
the determination of the general officers and myself; 
for we should have been very happy in an opportunity 
of succouring the southern states by a diversion, could 
it have been attempted with any tolerable hope of 
success. 
</p><p>
The small remains of the Jersey line seem necessary to form a head, to which the recruits, if any are 
obtained, may unite themselves. That line stands next 
for detachment, and therefore it is more than probable that it may soon become necessary to send the 
whole to the southward. But the reason, which I have 
just mentioned, operates in favor of keeping the remainder as long as possible. I shall be glad to hear 
from you, as to the time of your setting out from Elk, 
your prospects of getting forward, and the temper of 
the troops ; and, above all, I shall ever be happy in 
knowing that you are well, and that every thing contributes to your happiness and satisfaction, being very 
truly and sincerely, my dear Marquis, &,c.
