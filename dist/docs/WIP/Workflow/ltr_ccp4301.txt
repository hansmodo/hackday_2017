Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am infinitely obliged to you, for having favored me with introductory letters for my nephew, Mr. Horry. It will give him an opportunity of travelling 
with such great advantage, that every improvement he may thereby acquire, I shall always with gratitude attribute to your benevolent patronage.

We have lately ratified a new Constitution for this 
State. You will at once see that it is by no means 
perfect ; but, considering the different interests in this 
State, it is the best we could make, and the representation is calculated to give numbers and wealth 
their proper influence. By it, the poor will be protected in their freedom, and the rich in their property ; and it is attended with one great advantage, that 
might not perhaps attend a Constitution theoretically 
perfect ; it gives general satisfaction, both to the upper and lower parts of the country-, and was ratified 
unanimously. The Convention, before they dissolved 
themselves, prepared and directed an address to you. 
The Legislature which met last January, did not 
present an address ; because, as the Convention w^as 
to meet in May, it was thought that an address from 
the Legislature could not so properly or forcibly express the sentiments and gratitude of South Carolina, 
as the Convention of the people.

Mr. Henry Middleton, who served with you in the first Congress, and the son of the deceased Mr. Arthur Middleton, whom you may remember in some 
subsequent Congresses) will have the honor of delivering you this. He is travelling through the Middle and Northern States, for his improvement, and I 
have desired him to take charge of this letter, that 
he may have an opportunity of paying his respects 
to you, as he passes through <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I have the honor to be, with great gratitude and respect, your 
much obliged 
</p><p>
And most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
