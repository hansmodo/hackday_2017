Sir, 
</p><p>
I have this moment the honor of your letter by Monsieur Blanchard. I am very sorry for the difficulties 
and impediments, which fall in the way of your march, 
and hope they will decrease as you proceed. I have 
the pleasure to inform your Excellency, that my troops 
arrived at the Ferry yesterday, and began to pass the 
river at ten o'clock in the morning, and by sunrise of 
this day they were all completely on this side of the 
river. I hope your army will be enabled to cross with 
the same facility when they arrive. 
</p><p>
I have no news worthy of communicating from any 
quarter. I shall be happy in your company to-morrow 
at dinner at my quarters, and will meet you at the 
ferry to-morrow by eight o'clock, when we will either 
be furnished with some cold repast en passant, or I will 
take you to my quarters about three miles from the 
Ferry, where you shall be introduced to a warm breakfast. I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p>
