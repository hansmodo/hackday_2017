My dear General, 
</p><p>
As Count de Grasse cannot aid us in our most 
favorite object, an expedition against <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and 
if an attempt to reduce it is now made, it must be 
independent of a marine force ; and as your Excellency has asked my sentiments on the propriety or impropriety of attempting it under these circumstances, 
I do, on the fullest reflection, give it as my opinion 
that it may not be done with a rational hope of success, and beg leave to subjoin the following reasons, 
on which I have founded my judgment. 
</p><p>
First. If we have no ships of force to cover us, and 
to possess the harbour, we shall be reduced entirely to a land operation, and must regularly approach 
the works of the town, in doing which, we must contend with a heavy train of artillery. This will make 
it necessary for us to carry forward one equal, at 
least, which, together with the necessary stores for 
a siege, if I may judge by the quantity brought here, 
and by what was used by the enemy in the reduction of the place, will exceed, upon a moderate computation, twenty-five hundred tons. Add to that the 
baggage of the army, the stores in the Quarter-master's, Commissary's, and Hospital departments, and the 
whole will not be less than three thousand tons, to 
transport which it will be difficult, if not impossible, 
to provide teams. 
</p><p>
Secondly. As we must travel through a barren and 
a thinly inhabited country, where forage cannot be 
obtained but at a great distance, to remove which it 
would require a large additional number of teams 
(as three thousand bushels of corn will be necessary 
for each day's consumption, besides fodder), this also 
would be too great a demand for the country to 
bear, with others which would be increased by so 
large an army being in it. 
</p><p>
The removing such a force, with the necessaries for 
a siege, through an extent of country of four or five hundred miles, cut by many navigable rivers, unprovided with suitable boats for speedy transportation, 
would cause so great a delay as to shade, at least, 
every hope of success ; and especially if the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> should remain open, during that 
time, for the reception of such supplies and reenforcements as should be thought necessary by the enemy 
to baffle our attempt. 
</p><p>
Other reasons might be added, such as the ease 
with which the enemy might shift their situation, 
should they find it necessary; the impossibility of 
bringing off the artillery and stores, should the expedition fail; for a sufficiency of horses for this and 
other necessary purposes of the army could not be 
supplied. But I am confident I need not proceed. 
</p><p>
If the siege of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> should not be attempted 
this winter, the troops south of the Delaware will be 
such a reenforcement to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> as will put 
it in his power, with the present force of the enemy, 
to cover the country, and reduce the British to the 
lines of the town. The other troops will be refreshed 
by going northward to their winter-quarters, which 
will also cover that part of the country. By the 
French remaining in this State, they will hold a position convenient to give aid, either north or south, as 
circumstances shall demand. I have the honor to be, 
my dear General, with every sentiment of esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
