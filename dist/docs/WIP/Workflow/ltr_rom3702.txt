Sir, 
</p><p>
I take this earliest opportunity of acknowledging 
your Excellency's letter of the 25th, which I received 
last evening, and in which you request me to have 
ready my letters to the officers you are sending to 
the Eastern States, so as that they ma}' go by the 
next post. I would willingly comply with your Excellency's desire most literally, but I have rather 
wished to transmit my sentiments to you, that you 
may send them to the gentlemen, either in the whole 
or in part, as you shall think proper, and with such 
observations as may occur to you. 
</p><p>
Recruiting the army is certainly of importance, 
and ought therefore to be urged upon the several 
States ; but, should it be necessary to expend money 
for that purpose, it must not be considered as a part 
of the quota called for by Congress for the service 
of the current year. I shall make an application on 
this subject to Congress, and endeavour to have certain principles established, by which those States who 
exert themselves to bring their quota of troops early 
into the field may have full justice done them, and 
those States which are negligent be charged in proportion to that negligence. I mention these things, 
Sir, to obviate mistakes, which might be productive 
of very evil consequences. You who, being on the 
spot, and knowing my situation and arrangements, are 
better informed than any person how necessary it is 
that the money called for from the several States 
be punctually paid, without any deduction whatever; 
you are, I am sure, convinced, that if my measures 
are obstructed, jour own designs must prove abortive. 
And therefore you will, I am persuaded, take care to 
prevent an application of those funds to the recruiting service, which are necessary to the support and 
operation of those who are already enlisted. But as 
it ma} obviate those doubts, which are too apt to 
start in the minds of such gentlemen as compose the 
respective Legislatures, I repeat to your Excellency 
my assurance, that I will exert myself to have full 
justice done to those States who may bring their 
proportion of men into the field at an early period. 
</p><p>
Should you send officers who are now with the army, 
I expect that they will be able to give full information, from what they have seen of the benefits which 
result from the present mode of administration ; and 
I am sure that you are fully convinced of the superior cheapness with which supplies are obtained from 
what they were formerly. In order, then, that the army may be well and cheaply maintained, it is necessary that the States grant money. 
</p><p>
In considering the situation of the army, and comparing the wants with the means of satisfying them, 
it became necessary for me to arrange those wants so 
that the relief in my power might be properly extended. Feeding the army appeared to be an object 
of the first necessity ; clothing them was almost, if 
not altogether, as indispensable. After feeding and 
clothing them, the equipment for service demands attention, under which head must be classed the arms, 
ammunition, military stores, tents, camp equipage, and, 
in short, the whole of the Quarter-master's department. 
To the equipment for service succeeds the attention 
which is to be paid to the sick and wounded, an object in which justice and humanity combine most forcibly together. The pay of the army must, of necessity, be placed last in this list j but though last, it is 
by no means least, in my mode of contemplating it. 
Your Excellency knows so well my solicitude on this 
subject, that it is unnecessary to mention it here. 
But I should ill deserve the high trust reposed in 
me, if I permitted any consideration to divert me 
from that line which reason points out as my duty 
to walk in. 
</p><p>
The officers you may employ on the present occasion, will. I am sure, be men of good sense and candor. They will, therefore, judge properly of my reasonings, and give them their due weight to others. 
I may, perhaps, have misarranged the wants of our 
army ; but I think not. It is, however, proper to observe, that under the head of clothing I comprehend 
those means for clothing the officers, which I have 
now in contemplation, and had the honor of mentioning to your Excellency. If I am right in my ideas as to what is the proper mode of applying the public money, then every prudent officer will, instead of 
urging the States to grant a little money for the purpose of paying them, urge the grant of so much as 
will support and equip the army, and still leave a 
sufficiency for the pay. To increase the means of 
payment by retrenching every other expenditure, is 
my constant object ; to increase the means of payment by grant of money, the States alone are competent to. I hope, therefore, that the gentlemen you 
employ will join me in urging such grants, with all 
their force and abilities. 
</p><p>
It is from the same conviction which you feel of 
the advantages which must result to our country from 
an early and vigorous campaign, that I have spent 
money and stretched my credit to the utmost extent 
which I dare, in order that you might take the field 
at an early hour, and in a respectable manner. I 
have confided in the States, and the consequences of 
being deceived will be such that it is better you 
should conceive than I describe them. If they do 
not grant the sums called for by Congress, I cannot 
give that aid to your operations which I know to be 
indispensably necessary. But if they do grant me 
those sums, I pledge myself to support you fully in 
all your views; and you shall then have the pleasure 
of seeing your brave troops as regularly paid as they 
are now fed; â€” and then, knowing them to be well 
appointed, and in all respects fit for service, you will 
be enabled to accomplish those plans for the defence 
and salvation of our country which lie nearest your 
heart. That this may be speedily the case, is the 
most fervent wish of your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant,
