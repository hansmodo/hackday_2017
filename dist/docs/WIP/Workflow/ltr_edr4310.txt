SiR; 
</p><p>
I was honored by your private letter of the 6th instant, about half an hour ago ; and immediately delivered to Mrs. Washington the one addressed to her. 
</p><p>
Mr. Butler and Mr. Brown, of the Senate, called to learn the intelligence from Europe. I considered their title to read the despatches as being no better 
than that of other men; and I told them, verbally, only what I have told others. With the former gentleman some discussion arose how far the Senate 
might call for the papers relative to the negotiation ; but he did not, however, apply the remark to himself as an individual. I cut the matter short, by 
observing that he knew my opinion to be that the President was bound, in duty, and possessed the right, to withhold whatsoever he thought improper to be 
communicated. I could not help asking, at the same time, whether the example of Mr. Edwards, which I mentioned to you in a late letter, did not prove 
that Senators could disclose secrets as well as other folks.

There is nothing so little talked of as the yellow fever. I believe that I am almost the only inquirer after it; and those to whom I address myself, seem 
to take time to recollect themselves, as if the subject was a perfect stranger to their memory. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='met co-worker colleague'>General Knox</a> is with me ; and we shall have ready, for the 
express of Monday, the analysis of an address to Congress. Mrs. Washington and family were well this morning. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to he, Sir, with the highest respect and affectionate attachment, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
