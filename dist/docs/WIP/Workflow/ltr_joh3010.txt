SIR, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your letters of the 7th, 8th, 
and 9th instant. The two first I have read in congress. We have been two days in a Committee of 
the Whole, deliberating on three capital matters, the 
most important in their nature of any that have yet 
been before us, and have sat till seven o clock in the 
evening, each day. That not being finished, I judge 
best to return the express. I shall press Congress as 
soon as possible to determine upon the several matters you wish to be ascertained, and immediately 
transmit you the result. 
</p><p>
The Congress have agreed to settle the mode of 
paying the troops in the Eastern Department this 
morning, and to proceed to the appointment of a 
Deputy Paymaster-General. 
</p><p>
The particular mode of establishing expresses is 
now under the consideration of a Committee, and as 
soon as agreed, you shall know the issue. 
</p><p>
Although Congress have not acted upon your queries respecting the Indians, yet I will venture to give my opinion that Congress intended the resolution of May 25th should be general, and extend to 
the several departments ; and that the resolution of 
the 3d of June goes only to the number which the 
General shall be empowered to employ in Canada. 
But I hope soon to give you a full answer to all 
your queries ; and in future I will exert myself in 
Congress, that your applications may be considered 
as soon as received, and keep you punctually and 
regularly informed of the result. 
</p><p>
Inclosed you have a resolve, whereby you will see 
that all the troops in the Middle Department are put 
upon the same pay, six and two thirds dollars, as the 
troops in the Eastern Department. 
</p><p>
I have sent you four bundles of commissions, and 
will forward you more by next opportunity. 
</p><p>
The inclosed, from Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, I wish safe 
to hand. I have the pleasure to acquaint you she is 
in fine spirits, and proposes paying you a visit next 
week. I sent her your letter by the express; and 
when you write, if you will please to put the letter 
under my cover, I will immediately deliver it. I 
have the honor to be, with every sentiment that respect and esteem inspire, 
</p><p>
Sir, your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
