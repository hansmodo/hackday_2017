SIR, 
</p><p>
Captain Whipple returned here from his voyage to 
Bermuda on Friday last. He had received authentic 
intelligence of the arrival of the packet at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
before the first time limited for his cruise was Expired, and immediately sailed for Bermuda. He had 
light, flattering winds for several days, and when near 
the Island met with a violent gale, which drove him 
three or four degrees to the southward, and occasioned his having a long voyage. He put in at 
the west end of the Island, where the inhabitants, 
taking him to be an armed vessel belonging to the 
King, were thrown into the utmost confusion, and 
the women and children fled into the country ; but 
upon showing his commission and instructions, were 
satisfied, and treated him with great cordiality and 
friendship. They informed him, that, upon the powder being removed, the Governor had given General 
Gage an account of the part they had taken in the 
transaction, who had despatched a sloop of war, and 
a transport of six hundred tons, to take all the pro-visions sent to the Island. They then lay at George 
town, and treated the islanders as rebels. Captain Whipple had five of the King's Council on board 
his sloop, who all assured him, that the inhabitants 
were hearty friends of the American cause, and 
heartily disposed to serve it. As the assistance they 
gave in the removal of the powder hath made them 
obnoxious to the enemy, and reduced them to a disagreeable situation, I think they ought to be treated 
with every mark of friendship. I submit to your 
Excellency the propriety of our representing their 
case to the Continental Congress, and recommending 
them to favor. 
</p><p>
We are fitting out Captain Whipple for a cruise to 
the Eastward, with all possible expedition, which I 
hope will prove more fortunate than his last. I am, 
with acknowledgment of the polite treatment I received from you at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and with great respect, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your humble, and most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=nic" rel="me">NICHOLAS COOKE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. I inclose your Address to the inhabitants of Bermuda,
