Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My public letters to Congress will inform your 
Excellency of our situation in this quarter. We fight, get beath and fight again. We have so much 
to do and so little to do it with, that I am much afraid these States must fall, never to rise aa'ain : 
and, what is more, I am persuaded they will lay a train to sap the foundation of all the rest. 
</p><p>
I am greatly obliged to your Excellency for ordering the Marquis to the southward. I propose to halt 
him in Virginia, until the enemy's plan of operations 
is better known. <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> will join this army. 
He, having offended the Legislature of Virginia, cannot be as useful there as he has been. The Marquis 
is desired to keep your Excellency advised of all 
matters in that quarter, as it is too far first to come 
to this army and then be sent back again. 
</p><p>
When I was appointed to the command of this army, I solicited Congress to give Dr. McHenry a majority, that he might serve nie in the character of 
Aid. This they refused. I was persuaded, when I 
made the application, of the necessity, and since have 
felt it most sensibly. Your Excellency can scarcely 
tell how happy you are in your family, and therefore 
can hardly judge of my situation. I cannot make a 
second application to Congress on the subject, nor 
should I have hopes of succeeding, if I did ; but I 
shall esteem it a peculiar mark of your Excellency's 
friendship and esteem, if you will interest yourself 
in the matter, and get him a majority. Your Excellency will judge of the propriety of my request; and 
if my wishes have prompted me to ask any thing 
that does not accord "with your opinion or your feelings, I must beg you to decline the measure, and 
excuse me. 
</p><p>
It is a long time since I received a line from Mrs. 
Greene. I am afraid they have miscarried, before 
they got to head-quarters. I am sorry that you had 
not leisure to call on her on your return from Newport. She would have thought herself greatly honored, and been peculiarly happy on the occasion. 
</p><p>
With the greatest respect and esteem, I am, &c., 
</p><p>
