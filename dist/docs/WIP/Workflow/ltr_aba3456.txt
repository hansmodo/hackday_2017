With the only beloved daughter of my late venerable and respected friend, I pour the tear of sympathy, 
and with a full heart participate in the sorrowful 
event, which has deprived her of one of the most 
tender and affectionate of parents ; one of the best 
of mothers ; one of the kindest friends ; one of the 
pleasantest companions ; and one of the most exemplary of women. 
</p><p>
To me she was a u Friend of more than fifty years 
ripening," my earliest, my constant, and my oldest 
friend. Dear departed spirit, wilt thou still be my 
friend in those regions of immortal bliss, to which I 
trust thou art translated, and whither I hope ere long 
to follow thee. With Dr. Johnson, I can say " hope 
dictates what revelation does not confute ; that the 
union of souls may still remain, and we who are 
struggling with sin, sorrow, and infirmities, may have 
our part in the attention and kindness of those who 
have finished their course and are now receiving their 
reward." 
</p><p>
" Hope wipes the tear from sorrow's eye, 
And faith points upward to the sky."

Scarcely had the grave closed over the remains of 
my esteemed friend Madam Sargent, relict of the 
late Judge, ere it was again opened to receive those 
of one still dearer to me. It is more than fifty years 
since my acquaintance commenced with her, who in 
that period became your mother. I was then a 
child, and carried by my grandmother, to visit with 
her, your grandmother, whom she taught me from 
my earliest infancy to venerate, as well as to love 
and respect her daughter. And this, before any 
connexion in the family, united us in closer bonds. 
The early impressions I received, were indelibly 
stamped by time, and impressed by my own judgment, as I advanced in life, and became more capable 
of appreciating the many virtues of your late excellent parent, in the various relations she sustained, of 
daughter, wife, and mother, in each of which she 
had few equals, and I know not her superior. You 
have reason. for gratitude and thankfulness, that she 
was spared to you, to a very advanced age, and with 
as few of its infirmities as is the lot of humanity ; 
always possessing a cheerfulness and vivacity, which 
whilst it enlivened, delighted, for it was chastened 
with dignity and decorum. 
</p><p>
" Peace, and esteem, is all that age can hope," 
these she enjoyed through life, and having fixed her 
hopes and expectations upon a solid foundation, she 
is gone to reap the fruit of a well-spent life. 
</p><p>
" Heaven gives us friends to bless the present scene, 
Resumes thern, to prepare us for the next." 
Let ns, my afflicted friend, improve this dispensation, to that useful purpose, and whilst I reflect upon 
the many endearing virtues and bright qualities, 
which adorned the life and conversation of your 
dear departed parent, strive to emulate her example, 
and transplant them into our own lives. Thus shall 
we honor her memory, and transmit it with lustre to 
posterity. 
</p><p>
This is the fervent wish, and ardent desire, of 
your sympathizing friend, 
</p><p>
Abigail Adams.
