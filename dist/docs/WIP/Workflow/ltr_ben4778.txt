DEAR SIR. 
</p><p>
I received your Favour of the 13"' past, which I ought to 
have acknowledged sooner, but much Business and some 
Indisposition have occasioned the Delay. I can easily conceive the Difficulty a Man in your Situation, with such 
Connections, and so well esteemed and belov'd among them, 
must have in resolving to leave them with an Intention of 
Settling in a distant Country. And I do not wonder that your Regard for them should determine you to remain where 
you are. I was indeed of Opinion, from my Knowledge of 
that Country and of you, that if you should remove thither 
with your Family and Substance you would not only do 
extreamly well yourself, but have better Opportunities of 
establishing your Children in the World. Therefore I did 
not dissuade you when you appear'd to have such an Inclination. But at the same time, tho' I own I should have a 
Pleasure in adding such worthy Inhabitants to my Country 
as you and Mrs. Viny, and should be very happy in having 
you there for my Neighbours; yet as your Removal would 
give Pain to your good Brother here, whom I love and to 
many others that love you, I cannot, without extreme Reluctance think of using any Arguments to persuade you. Let 
us then leave that Matter where we found it. 
</p><p>
Possibly, however, as you are likely to have many Children, 
you may hereafter judge it not amiss, when they are grown 
up, to plant one of them in America, where he may prepare 
an Asylum for the rest, should any great Calamity, which 
God avert, befal this Country. A Man I knew, who had a 
Number of Sons, us'd to say, he chose to settle them at some 
Distance from each other, for he thought they throve better; 
remarking that Cabbages growing too near together, were 
not so likely to come to a Head. I shall be asleep before 
that time, otherwise he might expect and command my 
best Advice and Assistance. But as the Ancients who knew 
not how to write had a Method of transmitting Friendships 
to Posterity; the Guest who had been hospitably entertain'd in a strange Country breaking a Stick with every one 
who did him a kindness; and the Producing such a Tally 
at any Time afterwards, by a Descendant of the Host, to a 
Son or Grandson of the Guest, was understood as a good 
Claim to special Regard besides the Common Rights of 
Hospitality : So if this Letter should happen to be preserved, 
your Son may produce it to mine as an Evidence of the Good 
will that once subsisted between their Fathers, as an Acknowledgement of the Obligations you laid me under by your 
many Civilities when I was in your Country and a Claim to 
all the Returns due from me if I had been living. Pray 
make my best Respects acceptable to good Mrs. Viny, and 
give my Love to your Children. Be so good, too, as to remember me respectfully to your Sister and Brother-in-law, 
to Mr. Stace and Family, and to <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='acquaintance'>Mr. Hancock</a> ; and believe 
me ever, with sincere Regard, Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B. Franklin.
