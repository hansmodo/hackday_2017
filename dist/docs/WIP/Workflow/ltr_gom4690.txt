Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to transmit herewith duplicates of 
mine, of the sixteenth and twenty-sixth of November and 
twelfth of December. I also enclose copies of my letters 
of the twenty-ninth of December to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and of his answer ; of mine of the fourth of January, introducing the deputation sent up from Bordeaux, and 
of his of the twenty-sixth of Nivose in reply to it. 
</p><p>
The young man, Mr Griffith, whom I mentioned in mine 
of the twenty-sixth of November, is at length out of prison ; 
but another, of the name of Hoskins, still remains in confinement, and this merely because the multiplicity of business be 
fore the Committee prevents them from attending to anything. 
</p><p>
I learn that the number of persons arrested in this city 
amounts to fifteen thousand, and that through the Republic is 
more than tenfold more numerous. The petitions before 
them could not be read through in less than a year, supposing 
ten hours a day appropriated to that purpose ; and, as the 
arrestations are daily continued, those who are confined are in 
a sad and hopeless condition. 
</p><p>
The wiser part of those, who are at the head of affairs, are 
sensible that such severe measures must prove injurious, and 
perhaps fatal ; but they dare not appear as the advocates for 
the unfortunate, lest they should partake of their situation. 
Late experiments justify their apprehensions, and, if I may 
judge, the outs, who wish to be ins, will use this as a lever to 
overturn the power of their opponents ; so that the general 
gaol delivery, if effected, will come from those who inveigh 
against, not from those who propose it. The reason is clear. 
To advocate such a measure exposes to the charge of Moderatisme ; and you will observe here, that as Brissotisme succeeded to Fayettisme, which has succeeded to Aristocratic, so 
Moderatisme is now heir to all the odium of Brissotisme. 
Robespierre has luckily hit on the term Ultra-revolutionaire, and brought it with good success into the field against 
the term Contre-revolutionaire ; but it seems likely that 
Moderatisme, will prove too hard for Ultra-revolutionaire. 
</p><p>
I cut short these observations, to give you a sketch of the 
state of parties. Previous to which, however, lest I should 
forget it, I must mention, that Thomas Paine is in prison, 
where he amuses himself with publishing a pamphlet against 
Jesus Christ. I do not recollect whether I mentioned to 
you, that he would have been executed along with the rest of 
the Brissotines, if the adverse party had not viewed him with 
contempt. I incline to think that, if he is quiet in prison, he 
may have the good luck to be forgotten. Whereas, should 
he be brought much into notice, the long suspended axe 
might fall on him. I believe he thinks, that I ought to claim 
him as an American citizen ; but, considering his birth, his 
naturalization in this country, and the place he filled, I doubt 
much the right, and I am sure that the claim would be, for 
the present at least, inexpedient and ineffectual. 
</p><p>
There seems to be at present three parties among the doers 
of the day ; for I except those, who are entirely indisposed to 
the government. The one may be called the Dantonists, 
with whom Robespierre is connected, and who wish, by 
mildness and something like a government of laws, to inspire 
a sort of attachment to the revolution, apprehending that the 
people, so often disappointed in the expectations held out to 
them, may at length, by a kind of general effort, arising not 
from any particular plot or conspiracy, but from the universal 
sense of oppression, overturn the whole affair, which, what 
ever may be its future and national effect, must necessarily 
occasion their immediate and personal ruin. 
</p><p>
The second may be called the Parisian party, being those 
who wish by a new blow from the populace of this city to make 
a second edition of the piece acted on the 31st of May last, 
and thereby put themselves in the places of such as may be 
then sent to the guillotine. 
</p><p>
The third may be called the Ministerial party, and although 
the Ministers are, at present, no more than a kind of clerks, 
subject to the imperative, and too often the imperious, mandates 
of a Committee, yet as they are supported privately by those 
who wish to bring forward the Constitution, and as they have 
the natural advantage of men doing business with Committees, 
to see how much is sacrificed, and how much neglected, and 
thence show the great abuses inseparable from that sort of 
government, they have more weight and consistency, than 
would, at first sight, be imagined. As the present actors have 
more energy, as well as more experience, than those who 
suffered themselves to be elbowed off the stage on the 31st of 
May, I presume that things will be brought much sooner to a 
crisis. 
</p><p>
There is at present a plot in petto, which may, perhaps, 
blow up the Dantonists. I have heard different versions of it, 
and, therefore, will not give you any of them, because it is well 
known that matters of that kind undergo many changes before 
they are exhibited, and, besides, the whole affair may die 
away ; especially if any general danger should oblige the par 
ties to be friends for a month or two longer. Let parties rise or fall as they may, I do not think the present form of government by Committees can long stand. We have seen such a 
system fall by its own weight, when exercised on a much 
smaller scale, and any one who has anything to do with Committees here complains, which is the first step towards their 
ruin. 
</p><p>
The successes of the Republic will give pleasure to all those 
who are attached to France ; for whatever may be the opinions 
as to a government, which may undergo yet a dozen changes, 
it seems to be demonstrable from facts, that the plan of 
dismemberment, which I long since communicated, really 
exists, and it is that plan which has foiled the Allies. Admit 
ting what has been asserted by persons in a situation to know 
the truth, and deeply interested to prove the contrary of their 
assertion, that nine tenths of the nation are inimical to the 
government, it is an undoubted truth that ninety-nine hundredths are opposed to all ideas of a dismemberment, and will 
fight to prevent it. Hence it happens, that so few have joined 
the enemy on any part of the frontiers, except the inhabitants 
of Alsace, who have been, in their hearts, Germans; and hence 
also it happens, that the Vendee has been so vigorous in its 
operation, as in that quarter they fought simply to restore the 
ancient government and religion. If the allies had given them 
aid, God knows what would have been the consequence; but 
as the clear object, when aid was at length offered, consisted 
only in possessing themselves of strong holds for their own use, 
the whole plan has fallen through, and a great number of those 
poor people have been sacrificed. Exaggerated accounts state 
the destruction of the human race in that quarter at near a 
million of souls. It certainly has been very great, though not, 
perhaps, more than half that number. I am much mistaken if 
the spirit of revolt be quelled, although, for want of opportunity, 
it may not again perhaps break out. 
</p><p>
Toulon was evacuated rather than taken. Perhaps, if the 
evacuation had not been decided on, it would have been kept; 
but certainly the brisk attacks of the French precipitated very 
much the measures of the enemies. In my opinion, it was a 
great blunder not to throw succors into that place ; for, if it 
had been held a little longer, the French army must have re 
treated, from the want of subsistence. 
</p><p>
In like manner, it is now evident that if Bordeaux, Marseilles, Lyons, and Toulon, had all declared at the same time, 
instead of showing their evil dispositions one after the other, 
the whole southern part of France was irrecoverably lost to the 
Republic. And if the good faith of the enemy had not been 
suspected, this union of measures would have taken place. I 
learn, in like manner, that Strasbourg would have been delivered up, if the Emperor had not desired to take it in his own 
name, instead of that of Louis the Seventeenth. The Allies, 
not being able to possess themselves of this place, (in which 
the plan of surrendering was discovered, and its effects pre 
vented,) and failing at the same time in their blockade of 
Landau, which held out longer than they had calculated, were 
obliged to retire into winter quarters, and as this could not be 
unknown to the enemy, of course, they were attacked on all 
sides, and by a vast superiority of numbers. At first, the 
French were repulsed everywhere ; but the repetition of at 
tacks, (for there were in the whole between thirty and forty), 
wearied the defendants, who, by no resource of the military 
art, could bear up against the bodily fatigue of constant fight 
ing. The physical constitution of the French is more adapted to this service, than perhaps any other on earth. T &gt; re 
treat became necessary, and a retreat once begun, was continued from necessity, because the French kept pouring in 
fresh supplies of men when opposed, and continued their rapid 
advance wherever they were victorious. Mayence and Fort 
Louis could alone stop their pursuit. 
</p><p>
They are now taking off everything in .the country, which 
they have possessed themselves of, and in so doing, they form 
a barrier against themselves ; but what is to them of more importance is, that they form also a barrier against their enemies. 
On the north, it seems to be determined not to give the Allies 
any rest, and the calculation is simple. The soldiers brought 
from a distance cannot easily be replaced, and by constant 
fighting they may be destroyed, for their country being open, 
they have nothing to defend them but posts, which, however 
strong, may be carried by superior numbers. It is true that 
every one of the Germans so destroyed, may cost a dozen 
Frenchmen ; but, it is said that the dozen can be replaced 
more easily than the one. Mutual plunderings form a part of 
this warfare. Judge, then, how it must thin the ranks of man 
kind. I believe that nothing like it has appeared in Europe 
since the crusades. 
</p><p>
The resources of this country, its real resources I mean, are 
wearing away very fast, and if it be true, as it is said, that the 
population is already diminished one tenth within the last two 
years, it will have, at least, this one good effect, that the consumption of provisions must diminish in the same proportion. 
The fear of famine seems to be general ; and although I flatter 
myself that its greatest ravages may be avoided, yet I do not 
readily see how the resistance of the next campaign is to be 
effected, if the whole force engaged against France should 
continue its operation. 
</p><p>
I am premised daily, that the embargo laid on our ships in 
the port of Bordeaux shall be taken off, and an indemnification 
be granted for the losses which it has occasioned. I have 
never been able to learn why it was laid ; but have some reason to believe, that just ground of suspicion had been given as 
to the voyages, the cargoes, and even the property of some of 
the vessels then in that port. The deputation now here is pursuing the affair before the Committees, and will, I trust, be successful, as it had already been resolved on to give adequate 
redress, and I presume that they will not impair the favorable 
intentions which existed previous to their arrival. 
</p><p>
The ratio between paper and the precious metals remains 
about the same as it was when I last quoted it. Foreign ex 
changes have received a sad stroke. Monsieur Cambon had 
declared last June, that by the first of January the exchange should be at par. As the measures of policy, on which his 
prediction was founded, had not met with all the success de 
sired, it became necessary to supply the deficiency by force. 
</p><p>
You will learn with some surprise, perhaps, that all the 
funds belonging to French citizens in foreign countries have 
been put in requisition. Every man is called on to declare 
not only his own property abroad, but also that of others, 
which may have come to his knowledge ; the whole under 
the usual penalty of the guillotine. Such sums as are thus discovered are to be paid for at par, and every one is prohibited 
from purchasing bills on any pretext whatever. If this mea 
sure furnishes the expected resource, which I doubt, it cuts 
off all future hope. And if it does not furnish a very great re 
source, there will exist in the national affairs a deficit of serious magnitude, for they must face the demand abroad, or renounce the hope of supplies from thence, and on the expectation of such supplies depends the hope of avoiding in this city 
the evils of want, if not of absolute famine. 
</p><p>
It is a long time since I had the honor to mention to you 
Mr Francis Coffyn, acting at Dunkirk as Consul of the United 
States. This worthy man's interference in the affair of the 
Little Cherub (which, by the bye, remains yet undecided) has, 
through the intrigues of those concerned in the privateer, been 
the occasion of putting him in prison as a suspected person. 
The ground of which suspicion is. the having corresponded with 
Calorine, while Minister on the affairs of the town of Dunkirk, 
which had, it seems, some demand on the court. I have, in 
his absence, desired his son to attend to the affairs formerly in 
the hands of his father, and as he is a man of business, and by 
no means deficient in understanding, I trust that he will be 
able to conduct them well. 
</p><p>
I cannot, however, avoid repeating my wish, that Consuls, 
and Vice Consuls were appointed everywhere, for there is 
great need of them. It would have been happy had some one 
been named in this city as Consul, or by any other name or 
title, who might have followed up the Committees, waited day 
after day in their ante-chamber and the like, so as to plague 
them into decisions. The Ministers, as I have already mentioned, stand in such a situation that they dare not push the 
Committees very hard. You will easily see, that I cannot quit 
the regular line of application through the channel the government has thought proper to institute for the purpose. And, 
indeed, besides the impropriety of putting off the character of 
Minister to put on that of intriguant, or at best of a solicitor, I 
know that it would be a useless, as well as pernicious sacrifice of the national dignity. 
</p><p>
I have been requested by some to rename a person for that 
purpose ; but I have many objections to that measure, among 
which it is no small one that I have not the right to do it ; and, 
moreover, the state of things has long been, and still continues 
to be so critical, that every man, having even the shadow of a 
public character, is liable to the danger of compromising him 
self every instant. Hitherto, therefore, [ have left every one 
to choose his own agent for the conduct of his business, be 
cause the blame, which must inevitably fall, will then lie on 
the individual. I say that blame must fall, because those at a 
distance, judging only from appearances and from professions, 
form golden expectations, and imagine that nothing more is 
necessary, in order to realize them, than to bring forward 
something in the shape of an American. Facts are very different from such appearances. 
</p><p>
I suppose that the new Minister has, or shortly will have arrived at Philadelphia. I did not see him, for just as he went 
away, I was forced by one of the Committees into a dispute, 
which put them all out of humour, although they were soon 
sensible they were wrong. It is not worth while to go into 
the history of it, because the affair is blown over, and because 
the conduct of men in the midst of a revolution is not to be 
judged so severely as under a regular government. 
</p><p>
It is a long time since I learnt the attack of the Algerines, 
but as I knew that advices had been sent off to you, I did not 
mention it, not having then an immediate opportunity. I shall 
have occasion to say something on the subject shortly. I 
am, &c.
