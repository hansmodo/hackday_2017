Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Last evening, I was honored with your Excellency's favor of the 14th. I have given orders for the guard requested, as also to the Quarter-master to 
furnish forage at Mr. Birdsall's for the number of horses mentioned in your Excellency's letter. 
</p><p>
My answers to the questions proposed by your 
Excellency to the Council of War I will do myself 
the honor to deliver in person. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
