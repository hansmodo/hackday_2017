Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the 21st of January. I am still without any 
advices from you since your letters by Captain Culver, which 
I attribute to the interruptions, to which all communication 
with this country is exposed, and which for that, among many 
other reasons, I much lament. Amid the political storms 
which vex this hemisphere, the opinion of the United States is 
the polar star, which should guide my course, but which is to 
tally concealed from my view. 
</p><p>
Hoskins, whose imprisonment I mentioned in my last, has 
been liberated. I mentioned also that there had been some 
feeble attempts to adopt lenient measures, and substitute a 
government of law to the present system ; but hinted, at the 
same time, my apprehension that they would prove unsuccessful. You will see by the late decree that this apprehension 
was well founded, and that entire reliance is placed on severity and the resulting fear. This may perhaps succeed, 
but is exposed to a double danger. First, it facilitates the intrigues and the operations of the foreign enemy, by exciting 
attachment to the former, and aversion to the present government ; and, secondly, it breaks the minds of the people, and 
prepares them for an abject submission to an usurper, should 
any such arise in the course of successful war, either civil or 
foreign. 
</p><p>
I have mentioned Mr Paine's confinement. Major Jackson, 
who, by the bye, has not given me a letter from you, which he 
says was merely introductory, but left it with the Comite de Surete Generate as a kind of letter of credence, Major Jack 
son, relying on his great influence with the leaders here, stepped 
forward to get Mr Paine out of gaol, and, with several other 
Americans, has presented a petition lo that effect, which was 
referred to that Committee and the Comite de Saint Public. 
This last, I understand, slighted the application as totally 
irregular ; and some time afterwards Mr Paine wrote me a 
note, desiring I would claim him as an American, which I accordingly did, though contrary to my judgment, for reasons 
mentioned in my last. The Minister's letter to me of the first Ventose, of which I enclose a copy, contains the answer to my 
reclamation. I sent a copy to Mr Paine, who prepared a long 
answer, and sent it to me by an Englishman, whom I do not know. 
</p><p>
I told him, as Mr Paine's friend, that my present opinion 
was similar to that of the Minister, but I might, perhaps, see occasion to change it, and in that case, if Mr Paine wished it, I 
would go on with the claim, but that it would be well for him to 
consider the result, that if the government meant to release him 
they had already a sufficient ground ; but if not, I could only 
push them to bring on his trial for the crimes imputed to him ; 
seeing that, whether he be considered as a Frenchman, or as 
an American, he must be amenable to the tribunals of France 
for his conduct while he was a Frenchman, and he may aee in 
the fate of the Brissotins that to which he is exposed. I have 
heard no more of the affair since ; but it is not impossible that 
he may force on a decision, which, as far as I can judge, 
would be fatal to him ; for, in the best of times, he had a larger share of every other sense than of common sense, and lately 
the intemperate use of ardent spirits has, I am told, consider 
ably impaired the small stock, which he originally possess 
ed. 
</p><p>
The plan communicated to you of a requisition on all bankers, merchants, and others, to furnish bills for their funds 
abroad, and receive payment in Assignats at par, has totally 
failed, as might have been supposed. It was the boy in the 
fable who killed the goose which laid golden eggs. As a succedaneum, they have obliged the same people to execute joint 
and several obligations (billets solidaires) payable to the bearer for fifty millions of livres, say a forced loan of two millions 
sterling. These are to be negotiated in foreign countries, and 
the nation agrees to take them up again hereafter. What is 
somewhat extraordinary is, that a few of the monied men 
seem to believe in the success of this measure ; but I own I 
can scarcely conceive of it, for if foreigners believe in the ultimate success of the Republic, and in the integrity of her future 
government, the intervention of private credit would be unnecessary ; and, if not, it must be useless ; because, should 
the Republic be overturned, the plea of duress, by the individuals who have signed, must defeat all hope of recovery ; and 
because, if the Republic succeedirig, should be deficient in her 
integrity, the individuals would be of course covered by law 
against all judicial pursuit. Add to this, that there is a kind 
of absurdity in signing such obligations, by which the richest 
man binds himself for four times as much as he is worth. On 
this pin, however, is suspended, for the present, all hope of 
facing numerous and pressing engagements for indispensable 
supplies from abroad. 
</p><p>
I told you in former letters, that I apprehended a great 
scarcity of food for the present, or rather the coming campaign, should the Allied Powers persist in their hostility. 
</p><p>
They do persist, though the King of Prussia, taking advantage of circumstances, insists on being paid for the blood of 
his subjects. Food is already very scarce. Flesh is hardly 
to be obtained in Paris, and the drought of last summer reduced the crop of garden produce so low, that it is now nearly exhausted, and no great addition to be expected for three 
long months. 
</p><p>
You, who know the abundance of former times, will per 
haps form a better judgment by price than by description. 
Take therefore, as a sample, cabbages twenty-four sous, and 
carrots eight sous a piece, and other things in proportion ; 
sea fish are reduced in quantity, by reason of the war and 
the total want of flesh on the sea coast, to a degree incredible. 
For instance, the wealthiest families in Rouen, Havre, &ic. 
are obliged for many succeeding days to content themselves 
with two or three pounds of very bad salt pork, half a pound 
of bread each, and such few vegetables as they can procure. 
The distant departments have many of them been at short allowance for three months past ; others for a shorter period ; 
and Paris has been supplied as long as possible. But the re 
sources for flesh being at an end, the bulk of the inhabitants 
must soon come to bread alone. Now supposing a very 
doubtful fact, that the magazines of corn are sufficient for 
common times, and that no difficulty be experienced in the 
manufacturing and transportation, yet, as the consumption of 
that article must be increased by the want of all others, very 
serious evil is to be apprehended. As I write, I recollect 
some other articles of price, which during my late residence in 
Paris I heard mentioned. Eggs ten sous each, and salted 
herrings the same price. These last were the only things, 
which the poor could get the day before I left town, viz. the 
first of March, and these bad. Pulse is at thirty sous a 
quart. 
</p><p>
The enemy is collecting himself for an immense effort on 
the northern frontier. The troops of the Republic have long 
been assembling in the same quarter. Will the supplies be 
sufficient for the army and for the capital ? That is a question of serious magnitude. If Paris runs resty, the revolution 
is done. If the army disbands, the game is equally over. 
And such events have taken place since the government 
adopted terror for its maxim and support, that if once that 
terror were, by superior force, to receive a counter direction 
the Ancien Regime, or any other Regime, would, I think, be 
submitted to without the slightest struggle. 
</p><p>
The Vendee, so often and so totally destroyed in reports 
made to the Convention, seems still to exist, and to wait for 
the meditated descent from Great Britain, to break out with 
more violence than ever. If the royalists should again collect 
an army in that quarter, I believe it will become on both sides 
a war of extirpation. Torrents of blood have been already 
shed there, and, if the accounts from thence be not greatly exaggerated, another campaign like the last would convert the 
whole country into a desert. Barrere, in assigning at the bar 
of the Convention the causes of the present scarcity, said, that 
the Vendee, which used to furnish Paris market weekly with 
six hundred large beeves, now wants provisions ! 
</p><p>
I have often had occasion to mention the embargo laid at 
Bordeaux, and the sufferings of our countrymen consequent 
upon it. I have also mentioned the arrival of a deputation 
from that port to solicit the business in Paris. The day pre 
ceding their arrival the Minister told me, that everything 
should be settled to my satisfaction in two or three days. The 
deputation, to whom I communicated this intelligence, seemed 
very apprehensive lest their claims for damages should be referred to persons on the spot, which I own appeared to me 
both fair and natural; but they assigned reasons against it, 
which were satisfactory to themselves, and as they were determined to have everything adjusted in their own way, and 
were well convinced that their representations must have the 
desired effect; as they seemed, moreover, to be filled with 
suspicions of Mr Fenwick, which seemed to me ill founded, 
and therefore very liable to adopt them in respect to any other 
of the public servants, I thought it best to leave the business to 
their own management. I asked them, therefore, what they 
wished me to do, after having shown them what had already 
been done. They hesitated a little, as is usual when men 
have not thought of any course of procedure before they be 
gin to act. They desired an introduction to the Minister, 
which I immediately gave, and they went to him next day, 
but came back much out of humor. They afterwards presented a petition to the Convention, which was referred to the Comite de Salut Public, and there the affair seems to have 
ended, for all their urgency to that Committee has not got 
them one inch forward. 
</p><p>
I apprehend that they may have injured their own claim, by 
interfering unnecessarily in other matters; one instance of 
which I shall presently have occasion to mention. They have 
at length called on me to make new demands, declaring their 
intention to abandon the property of their vessels. I expected 
that they would have gone back, but find that they determine 
to remain still longer in Paris, which may, I fear, prove detrimental. 
</p><p>
However, on the twenty-seventh of last month, the day after I received their letter, I wrote to the Minister on the subject. I send herewith a copy of my letter, with one of the 
same date respecting the vessels and cargoes brought in by 
French frigates, contrary not only to our own treaty, but to 
every principle of the law of nations. These captures create 
great confusion, must produce much damage to mercantile 
men, and are a source of endless and well founded complaint. 
Every post brings me piles of letters about it from all quarters, 
and I see no remedy. You have a copy of the Minister's answer to my letter, holding out the hope of a speedy decision; 
but it may be very long before it can be obtained. And, in 
the mean time, if I would give way to the clamors of the injured parties, I ought to make demands very like a declaration of 
war. 
</p><p>
What am I to do in such cases ? It is impossible for me to guess the intentions of government, and indeed, Sir, the 
responsibility is great and distressing. Our countrymen here 
find, that it is the easiest thing in the world to carry any point 
with the Committees, until they have tried. In the mean time, 
I am exposed to their clamors in this country, and most 
probably to their censures in my own, for not performing 
impossibilities. In order to complete the business, nothing 
more is necessary, than that the rulers of this Republic, 
wearied with my complaints, should apply for my recall, in 
order to get rid of a troublesome fellow. I think it is very 
likely to happen, if it be not already done. I beg your par 
don, Sir, for saying so much of myself, but it is a troublesome 
thing to navigate in the dark between Scylla and Charybdis, 
without chart or compass. 
</p><p>
I send you enclosed the copy of a letter I received on the 
fifth of last month from a number of Americans here, (including therein some of the Bordeaux deputation,) with a copy 
of my answer of the sixth. I sent copies of both to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and called on him shortly after to 
mention several things, some of which I have already noticed. 
Among them was the long depending affair of the Laurens, at Havre, and the decrees made in her case violating our treaty. 
I took occasion then to mention again, what I had said in 
answer to the letter from my countrymen, viz. that I was in 
hourly expectation of instructions respecting those decrees. I 
told him that, until they arrived, I should forbear any formal 
application ; but, under the existing circumstances, I would in 
a friendly manner take leave to express some single idea ; that, 
if the government meant to abide by the treaty, they had 
better anticipate the arrival of those instructions, and by a 
voluntary step preserve an air of dignity and good faith. But 
if, on the contrary, they meant to persist in the violation, then 
it would be well to consider the events likely to take place, 
and to provide for them in season. He felt much obliged by 
this mode of treating the affair, and told me that the thing was 
already before the Committee in the case of the Laurens, and that he would endeavor to procure a speedy and satisfactory decision. 
</p><p>
You will find herein the report made by Jean Bon St 
Andre, which is fully confirmatory of the treaty. Some little 
matters (errors) of form have impeded the execution of the final 
decision, and the communication which he is to make to me ; 
but I thought it a proper moment to bring forward the case of 
the Enterprise, which is the subject of the above mentioned 
letter from Ingraham and others to me. I, therefore, having 
previously concerted measures with the Minister, prepared a 
short petition from Captain Ingraham to the Comite de Salut 
Public, as an appeal . from the decision of the Executive 
Council, and sent it to the Minister, who forwarded it to the 
Committee, and intends to support before them the principles 
of the petition, and labor for a reversal of the judgment. 
</p><p>
I send you enclosed the copy of my letter to the Minister of 
the 22d of last month, respecting the imprisonment of our 
Vice Consul at Havre, and of his answer. I shall pursue this 
business to obtain his liberation. Poor CofTyn is still con 
fined. 
</p><p>
While on the subject of violations of personal liberty, it is 
proper to communicate a step, which late circumstances induced me to take. I have already hinted at a little dispute I had 
with the Comite de Surete Generale. It arose about the ar 
rest of a person in my house. Particular reasons prevented 
me from pushing the matter to a serious issue then. I shall 
perhaps, take occasion to communicate them hereafter, when I 
am sure of my conveyance. The Committee were made sensible that they had done wrong, and that was all which I 
thought necessary. 
</p><p>
They have since (though not towards me) gone greater 
lengths, by arresting the Charge d AfFaires of Malta. This rendered it proper to make a more pointed animadversion on their 
conduct, and produced the enclosed pieces of the 27th of 
February. The Minister's answer of the eleventh Ventose is 
also enclosed, and I find by the gazettes, that on the report of 
the Comite de Salut Public a decree has been passed in the 
premises, of which I have not yet received communication 
from the Minister. 
</p><p>
The Comite de Salut Public and the Comite de Surete Generale are not, I am told, on the best terms together, and will 
probably come to something more overt than words ere long. 
It is of little importance under what forms parties or factions 
may present themselves ; their real origin is in the political 
form of the society ; and if anything prevents their rage, it 
must be the situation of Foreign Affairs. It is supposed that 
the approaching famine will be the signal for hostilities between 
the contending parties ; but it would seem not over prudent 
in any man, or set of men, to aim at power under present circumstances. I am, &tc.
