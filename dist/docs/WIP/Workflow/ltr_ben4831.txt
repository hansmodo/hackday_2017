DEAR COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I received your kind Letter of Nov 8. and rejoice to hear 
of the continued Welfare of you & your good Wife & four 
Daughters: I hope they will all get good Husbands. I 
dare say they will be educated so as to deserve them. 
</p><p>
I knew a wise old Man, who us'd to advise his young 
Friends to chuse Wives out of a Bunch ; for where there were 
many Daughters, he said they improv'd each other, and from 
Emulation acquired more Accomplishments, knew more, 
could do more, & were not spoil' d by parental Fondness like 
single Children. Yours have my best Wishes, and Blessing, 
if that can be of any Value. 
</p><p>
I receiv'd a very polite Letter from Mr. Bowen relating to 
the Print. Please to present him my respectful Compliments. 
I am just returned from as long a Journey as a Man can well 
make in these Islands, thro' Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and 
the Northern Parts of England ; and I find my Health much 
improv'd by it. I shall soon take some good Opportunity of letting you see one of the Books that were collected by 
your good Grandfather. Sally Franklin presents her Duty 
to you & Mrs. Franklin, and Love to her Kinswomen. I 
am, Dear Kinsman, 
</p><p>
Yours very affectionately 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
