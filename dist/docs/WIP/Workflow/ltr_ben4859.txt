DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have deferred Writing to you agreable to the Caution 
you gave me, till this safe Opportunity offered. America 
is infinitely oblig'd to you for your continued good Wishes 
& Schemes for her Advantage : But I am sorry to tell you 
that she is here become an Object of Jealousy, and that the 
obtaining Money from our poor Treasury to forward such 
Schemes, tho' at the same time equally beneficial to this Country, is out of all Expectation. A new Colony however is 
forming, where good Land may be had cheap, & where your 
Friend may probably find an Opportunity of serving himself 
& Family, while he is at the same time useful to the Publick 
wherein I shall be glad to serve him. Of this I shall write 
more fully when things are riper. In the meantime, I am, 
with great Esteem, Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient 
</p><p>
humble Servt. 
</p><p>
B. F.
