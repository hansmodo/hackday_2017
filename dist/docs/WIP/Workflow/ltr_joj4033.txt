Dear Benson, 
</p><p>
Either some very singular fatality must have attended 
the letters of my New-York friends to me, or they have 
given mc abundant reason to complain of them as correspondents ; not one letter to me, dated in our State, has 
reached me since I left America. 
</p><p>
I have written to you from Martinico, from Cadiz, and 
from this place ; some of these letters, I have reason to think, 
arrived safe, though several others have probably miscarried. 
Your governor is largely in my debt, and so is <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>, whom I always thought a very punctual correspondent. How am I to account for this ? I cannot persuade myself that neglect is among the causes. Business 
seldom continues a good excuse for a year together, and 
indolence, often a real, is never an admissible one. 
</p><p>
The vulgar proverb, out of sight, out of mind, always 
appeared to me in the light of a vulgar error, when applied 
to old friends and companions. I hope I have not been 
mistaken, especially as the contrary of that proposition is 
true with respect to myself. I never loved or admired 
America so much as since I left it, and my attachment to 
my friends in it seems to have increased, in proportion as 
distance of time and place separated me from them. The 
remark that we seldom estimate blessings justly till we are 
about to lose them for a time, or altogether, is, I believe, 
frequently true, and perhaps that circumstance has tightened 
the cords which bind me to my friends and country. I 
could carry your recollection back to days that are past, 
and entertain you with the shades of many departed 
pleasures, in which we had been partakers. These shades 
speak a language that I hope your heart understands as 
well as mine, and I still flatter myself that their voice, 
though not loud, will be sufficient to awaken a remembrance 
of the sincere attachment and regard, with which I have 
long been, and still am, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and servant, 
</p><p>
