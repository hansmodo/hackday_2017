I RECEIVED your obliging letter of the loth May, with the 
most acceptable present of your Physiocratie, which I have 
read with great pleasure, and received from it a great deal of 
instruction. There is such a freedom from local and national 
prejudices and partialities, so much benevolence to mankind 
in general, so much goodness mixt with the wisdom, in the 
principles of your new philosophy, that I am perfectly 
charmed with them, and wish I could have stayed in France 
for some time, to have studied in your school, that I might 
by conversing with its founders have made myself quite a 
master of that philosophy. ... I had, before I went into 
your country, seen some letters of yours to Dr. Templeman, 
that gave me a high opinion of the doctrines you are engaged in cultivating and of your personal talents and abilities, 
which made me greatly desirous of seeing you. Since I had 
not that good fortune, the next best thing is the advantage 
you are so good to offer me of your correspondence, which 
I shall ever highly value, and endeavour to cultivate with all 
the diligence I am capable of.

I am sorry to find that that wisdom which sees the welfare 
of the parts in the prosperity of the whole, seems yet not to 
be known in this country. . . . We are so far from conceiving that what is best for mankind, or even for Europe in 
general, may be best for us, that we are even studying to 
establish and extend a separate interest of Britain, to the prejudice of even Ireland and our colonies. ... It is from 
your philosophy only that the maxims of a contrary and more 
happy conduct are to be drawn, which I therefore sincerely 
wish may grow and increase till it becomes the governing 
philosophy of the human species, as it must be that of superior 
beings in better worlds. I will take the liberty of sending 
you a little fragment that has some tincture of it, which, on 
that account, I hope may be acceptable. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to present my sincere respect to that venerable apostle, Dr. Quesnay, and to the illustrious Ami des 
Hommes (of whose civilities to me at Paris I retain a grateful 
remembrance), and believe me to be, with real and very 
great esteem Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and most obedient humble servant
