Sir, 
</p><p>
It is now about a year and a half since I had the honor of receiving a letter from yon, dated November 
16th, <a href='/results.php?year=1787'>1787</a>. I do not pretend to make you any 
apology for not troubling you with an acknowledgment sooner, though I rather think it necessary to 
make one for troubling you, in the important station you now fill, with my congratulations on the event 
which placed you at the head of the American Government. But it is not you. Sir, that I consider as 
benefited by the unanimous election of the Americans. Your philosophic turn of mind would have led 
you to the completion of human happiness in a private station ; but the Americans, in their judicious 
choice, have, I flatter myself, secured to themselves the full and permanent enjoyment of that liberty, for 
which they are indebted to your persevering valor, in the first instance. Your wisdom and virtue will, 
undoubtedly, enable you to check the progress of every opinion inimical to those rights which you have 
so bravely and fortunately asserted, and for which many of your countrymen have paid so dear ; and 
you will be a bright example, to future Presidents, of an integrity rarely to be met with in the first stations of life.

All the friends of freedom on this side the Atlantic are now rejoicing for an event which, in all probability, has been accelerated by the American Revolution. You not only possess, yourselves, the first of 
human blessings, but you have been the means of raising that spirit in Europe, which I sincerely hope will, in a short time, extinguish every remain of that 
barbarous servitude under which all the European nations, in a less or a greater degree, have so long been 
subject. The French have justified the nobleness of their original character, arid, from the immersions of 
luxury and frivolity, have set an example that is unique in all the histories of human society ; a populous nation effecting, by the firmness of their union, 
the universality of their sentiments, and the energy of their actions, the entire overthrow of a despotism 
that had stood the test of ages. We are full of wonder, in this part of the world, and cannot conceive 
how such things should be. Your friend and eleve, the Marquis de la Fayette, has acted a part in this revolution, which has raised him above his former 
exploits, because his conduct has been directed to the good of his distressed countrymen, and shows him far above those base and narrow selfishnesses with 
which particular privileges are so apt to taint the human mind.

I have heard that a Monsieur Brissot de Warville has lately become a citizen of America. He is a warm friend to liberty, and a man of the first-rate abilities. 
He is a great friend of mine ; and, as I presume he has been presented to your Excellency, I will take the liberty, which your known goodness inspires, to 
beg that you would remember me to him, and assure him of my wishes for his prosperity and happiness.

Mr. Graham joins me in best respects to yourself and Mrs. Washington. We contemplate, with no small pleasure, the advantage America will reap from 
that check to all the luxuries of dress which her example of an elegant simplicity in this article will undoubtedly effect. I am, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and obliged humble servant,
