SIR, 
</p><p>
Your several favors to the 30th ultimo, inclusive, I 
have had the honor of receiving, in the order of their 
dates. 
</p><p>
From the inclosed resolves, you will perceive that 
the Congress have appointed a committee to collect 
and arrange the evidence relative to the evacuation 
of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, which will be afterwards transmitted 
to you, that a court-martial may be thereupon instituted for the trial of the General Officers who were 
in the Northern Department when the evacuation took 
place. 
</p><p>
The great demand for arms to equip the militia, 
who are called into service, has induced the Congress 
to pass the inclosed resolve, directing that a number 
of workmen, conversant in the business of repairing 
firelocks, should be immediately detached from the 
militia, to be employed in repairing the arms in this 
city, there being between two and three thousand 
that in a short time may be rendered fit for use. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to congratulate you on our 
further success in the Northern Department, in raising 
the siege of Fort Schuyler. The enemy, on the approach of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>, fled with the utmost precipitation, leaving behind them their tents, ammunition, provision, &c. As I forward herewith several 
letters for you from that quarter, which I make no 
doubt contain an account of the matter, I beg leave 
to refer you to them for further particulars. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
