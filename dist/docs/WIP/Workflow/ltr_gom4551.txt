Mr Morris had the honor to wait upon his Grace, the Duke 
of Leeds, this morning, but had not that of seeing him. He 
presents his most respectful compliments, and will be happy to 
know the time when it will be most convenient for his Grace to 
receive certain communications, which Mr Morris is directed 
to make to his Majesty's ministers, by the President of the United States of America.
