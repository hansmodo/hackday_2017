Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to your Excellency that, 
at my departure from York in Virginia, I would 
leave in that place a detachment of four hundred 
French troops, which were to he joined by a corps 
of the Virginian militia, to assure the possession of 
that harbour to the French navy now there, and that 
may arrive in future. At the moment of my leaving 
that place, the American militia were just beginning 
to arrive ; and I have left M. de Lavalette, Brigadier-General, with four hundred French troops. I 
have expressly recommended to him the American artillery, which remained there after the siege of York, 
with orders to place it upon <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, to join it 
to our siege artillery, in case superior land and sea 
forces should oblige him to retreat on <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, 
with the King's navy. I think that the quantity of 
American artillery left at York is much greater than 
is necessary for the conservation of that post, and 
that at least one half may be taken away, whenever 
your Excellency shall think fit. 
</p><p>
One battery of eight pieces at York, and another 
of six at Gloucester, will be sufficient to protect the 
harbour ; and I am of opinion that <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> 
will do very well to send his orders that the rest, 
amounting to thirty pieces and upwards, according to 
the best of my knowledge, may be removed. This is 
my opinion. Sir, in answer to the letter which you 
did me the honor to write me on that object yesterday. I am, with respect and personal attachment. 
Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant,

P. S. I send to your Excellency my answer to 
Sir Guy Carleton, which I beg you would read, and 
send by the first occasion to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>.
