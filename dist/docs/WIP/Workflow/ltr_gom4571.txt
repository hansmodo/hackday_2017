Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As soon as I can place objects here in due arrangement, I 
shall proceed to Holland. Before I take there my last engagements, I wish most earnestly to be, through you, in such treaty 
as to leave room, for I expect that those engagements will bind 
me as to all future operations. From Holland I shall perhaps 
be obliged to go to England. But I contemplate, in all cases, 
a return to this capital, as speedily as possible ; and from hence 
I wish to go to Madrid. You will calculate, however, that as 
the most important scene acted for many years on the Euro 
pean theatre will, in the next spring, be displayed at this place. 
I, in common with all others, have a curiosity to see it. You 
must also consider, that I have motives stronger than curiosity; 
for until the States-General shall have decided on the important 
objects for which they are convened, their government can 
make no solid arrangements for anything. Of this be assured, 
that if nothing happens very unexpected, I will see you in 
Spain before I return to America.

Lafayette is out of town. He is gone to Auvergne to get 
himself elected, either for the Noblesse or the Tiers Etats. I 
hope the former, for he would otherwise, in my opinion, be too 
desperately estranged from those of his own class. As he did 
not communicate to me his hesitation, I presume that he had 
determined, for he made some important communications just 
before his departure. Apropos a term which my Lord Chesterfield well observes we generally use to bring in what is not 
at all to the purpose apropos then, I have here the strangest employment imaginable. A republican, and just as it were 
emerged from that assembly, which has formed one of the most 
republican of all republican constitutions, I preach incessantly 
respect for the prince, attention to the rights of the nobility, and moderation, not only in the object, but also in the pursuit 
of it. All this, you will say, is none of my business ; but I 
consider France as the natural ally of my country, and of 
course, that we are interested in her prosperity ; besides, to 
say the truth, I love France, and, as I believe the king to be 
an honest and good man, I sincerely wish him well, and the 
more so, as I am persuaded that he earnestly desires the felicity of his people. I am, &ic.
