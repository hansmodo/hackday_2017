Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I went to dine with the Count de Montmorin, and expressed to him my wish that France 
might seize the present moment to establish a liberal 
system of commercial policy for her Colonies. I observed, that her interest was deeply at stake, because 
America could always dispose of the Islands, and 
would naturally wish to see them in possession of 
that power, under whose government they would be 
most advantageous to her; that nothing could tend so 
much to make the United States desirous of an alliance with Britain, as to exclude them from a free 
trade with the French Colonies ; that, if the metropolis wishes to preserve the affection of her distant 
subjects, and to derive from them the greatest commercial benefit, she ought to suffer them to draw 
their subsistence from that quarter where they can 
obtain it most cheaply. He assured me, that he was 
fully of my opinion ; said that our position rendered 
it proper to make in our favor an exception from 
their general system respecting other nations, and 
that he hoped, within a fortnight, something might 
be done. But he lamented, as he had done before, 
that they have no Chief Minister, and consequently 
no fixed plan nor principles. I shall see him again before I depart, and also <a href="/results.php?tla=cdl" rel="met colleague">Monsieur de la Luzerne</a>, 
within whose department this matter regularly lies. He is an adherent to the exclusive system, which is unfortunate.

In the National Assembly, also, there is a considerable difficulty. Among the most violent of the 
violent party, are some Representatives of cities on 
the western coasts of this kingdom, where the chief 
commerce is with the Islands; and those who wish 
for the closest union with America, do not wish to 
offend these gentlemen, and therefore are desirous of 
waving the matter at present. For my own [part], I 
am very desirous that the business should be put in 
train, at least. If successful, so much the better; but 
at any rate, it will give an alarm on the other side 
of the Channel. If either of these rival nations sets 
the example, the other will soon follow ; and although 
it is not very clear, that the actings and doings of the 
Assemble Nationale in general will long endure, yet 
whatever they grant to us in this particular business, 
those who come after them will be fearful of retracting. Under these impressions, for a long time past, 
I have been endeavouring to smooth the way towards 
our object ; and I believe in the success. I am, &c.,
