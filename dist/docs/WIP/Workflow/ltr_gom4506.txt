Sir, 
</p><p>
We have received yours of the 19th, which has afforded 
us great pleasure, since we are enabled in some measure to 
collect from it our errand to the northward, " one of the most 
important objects of our journey " being, in the opinion of your 
honorable board, to write the news. Could we have conceived, that this was your intention in appointing us a committee 
" to confer with Major <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='met colleague'>General Schuyler</a> upon such measures, 
as might from time to time appear necessary to be pursued by 
this State, for the aid and support of the northern department," 
we should have endeavored so to correspond with the Council, 
as to have informed them, as far as lay in our power, of the 
'manner of the retreat from Ticonderoga, the number of the 
men that came off, whether any or how many were taken, whether 
the sick came away, whether the troops brought off their arms" 
and the like. It is not in our power, Sir, to answer these important objects of our journey, because we are much in the 
dark about those matters, which attract the attention and strict 
scrutiny of your honorable board, and about which the General can give us no information ; but we shall leave this place 
tomorrow morning, to wait upon you, and answer such questions as you shall be pleased to put to us. 
</p><p>
It was determined upon to leave the ground occupied by 
our advanced posts, upon the road to Fort Anne and Fort 
George, and retire to Fort Edward in the way to this place, 
having previously removed everything. About noon the picquet guard of the party, upon the Fort Anne road, was attacked by savages and British troops. It is not, we suppose, of 
great importance minutely to describe this engagement. We 
will therefore record nothing more upon your minutes, than 
that we drove off the enemy, and in so doing had one man killed and scalped, twelve more killed, and twelve wounded, 
five of them mortally. This evening the retreat was completed to this place, where the General would be strongly 
posted, if he had men. Three hundred of the militia of Massachusetts Bay went off this morning, in spite of the opposition, 
we should have said entreaties, of their officers. All the militia on the ground are so heartily tired, and so extremely desirous of getting home, that it is more than probable none of 
them will remain ten days longer. One half was discharged 
two days ago, to silence, if possible, their clamor ; and the remainder, officers excepted, will soon discharge themselves, at 
which time the army in the northern department will consist 
of about twenty-seven hundred continental troops, sick and 
well. We make no comments. 
</p><p>
But, Sir, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a> cannot flee. If a body of three thousand men can be formed from the militia of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, somewhere upon the New 
Hampshire Grants ; if <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker'>General Washington</a> can spare a reinforcement of fifteen hundred good troops to this army ; if, 
discharging all the militia in the Forts and passes of the Highlands, the governor is put at the head of one third of the militia of the state, and two hundred good riflemen, and sent into 
Tryon county ; we may laugh at Mr Howe and <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Mr Burgoyne</a>. We are too ignorant of the situation of affairs to the 
southward, to say whether these things are practicable, and, 
therefore, give our sentiments on matters as they appear. We 
</p><p>
have the honor to be, Sic.
