DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received with great Pleasure the Assurances of your kind 
Remembrance of me, and the Continuance of your Good will 
towards me, in your Letter by M. le Comte Chreptowitz. 
I should have been happy to have rendered him every Civility 
and Mark of Respect in my Power (as the Friend of those I 
so much respect and honour) if he had given me the Opportunity: But he did not let me see him. 
</p><p>
Accept my sincere Acknowledgements and Thanks for the 
valuable Present you made me of your excellent Work on the 
Commerce of the India Company, which I have perused with 
much Pleasure and Instruction. It bears throughout the 
stamp of your Masterly Hand, in Method, Perspicuity, & 
Force of Argument. The honourable Mention you have 
made in it of your Friend is extremely obliging. I was 
already too much in your Debt for Favours of that kind. 
</p><p>
I purpose returning to America in the ensuing Summer, 
if our Disputes should be adjusted, as I hope they will be 
in the next Session of Parliament. Would to God I could take 
with me Messrs, du Pont, du Bourg, and some other French 
Friends with their good Ladies! I might then, by mixing 
them with my Friends in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, form a little happy 
Society that would prevent my ever wishing again to visit 
Europe. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere Esteem and Respect, I am, Dear Sir, 
Your most obedient 
</p><p>
& most humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
