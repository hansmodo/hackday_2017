Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Many weeks have elapsed since I have been favoured with any letters from you. I have received a letter from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, dated at sea, and covering the one herewith enclosed for you. A vessel has arrived at Bilboa, in 
twenty-four days from Salem. I received by her some family letters, which came from Bilboa under cover to a 
gentleman here. She brought for me a large packet, which was put into the post-office, and ought to have come to 
hand a week ago. I have inquired for it, but in vain. This is not an uncommon case, and shows how necessary 
it is that Congress should take some other means for conveying intelligence to and from their ministers than the 
European post-offices. Be pleased to make my compliments to your grandson, and remind him that he is three letters in my debt. 
</p><p>
You will also find herewith enclosed a copy of a letter I have received from Silas Talbot, a prisoner at <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, requesting aid. 
</p><p>
This gentleman gives a true description of himself. He 
has on various occasions acted like a very brave and enterprising officer, and the journals of Congress contain 
ample evidence of it. I sincerely lament his situation, and 
regret that my own does not put it in my power to afford 
him relief. The far greater part of the money which the 
public demands require here, I draw from you. The 
amount of the bills drawn upon me by Congress far exceeds that of the funds prepared for their payment, and 
the debts already incurred on account of distressed American seamen still remain unpaid. It would not be delicate 
in me to advance money to Colonel Talbot, and then request the favour of you to replace it, especially as his 
situation places him more immediately under your care 
than mine. All that I can therefore do with propriety is 
to make you acquainted with his case. He has served his 
country zealously, and has a right to her care ; gratitude 
as well as policy dictates it. I fear too little attention has 
in general been paid to our captive seamen. I often hear 
of many entering into the enemy's service for want of 
bread, and for ill treatment not retaliated ; even those who 
have had the good fortune and address to escape, are frequently obliged, in seeking opportunities to return home, to 
wander about from place to place, friendless, penniless, 
ignorant of the language of the strangers through whose 
Land they pass, making known their wants only by the voice 
of distress, and subsisting on the wretched husks cast to 
them by the frugal hand of charity. Nor is this all: 
although their misfortunes, on finding American vessels 
bound home, ought to recommend them to their brethren, 
yet it too often happens that masters of American vessels 
inhumanly refuse (unless paid passage-money) to carry 
home these unfortunate people, though offering to do duty 
without wages as sailors during the voyage. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, with sincere esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
