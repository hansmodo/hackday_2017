Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In my first moments of leisure I acknowledge the receipt of 
your several favors. 
</p><p>
To thank you for the interesting communications contained 
in those letters, and for the pains you have taken to procure 
me a watch, is all, or nearly all, I shall attempt in this letter ; 
for I could only repeat things, were I to set about it, which I 
have reason to believe have been regularly communicated to 
you in detail, at the periods which gave birth to them. It may 
not, however, be unpleasing to you to hear in one word, that 
the national government is organized, and as far as my information goes, to the satisfaction of all parties ; that opposition 
to it is either no more, or hides its head ; that it is hoped 
and expected it will take strong root ; and that the non-acceding States will very soon become members of the union. No 
doubt is entertained of North Carolina ; nor would there be any 
of Rhode Island, had not the majority of those people bid adieu, 
long since, to every principle of honor, common sense, and 
honesty. A material change however has taken place, it is said, 
at the late election of representatives, and confident assurances 
are given, from that circumstance, of better dispositions in their 
legislature at its next session, now about to be held.

The revolution which has been effected in France is of so 
wonderful a nature, that the mind can hardly realize the fact. 
If it ends as our last accounts to the first of August predict, 
that nation will be the most powerful and happy in Europe ; 
but I fear, though it has gone triumphantly through the first 
paroxysm, it is not the last it has to encounter before matters 
are finally settled. In a word, the revolution is of too great a 
magnitude to be effected in so short a space, and with the loss 
of so little blood. The mortification of the King, the intrigues of the Queen, and the discontent of the princes and noblesse, will foment divisions, if possible, in the National Assembly, and they will unquestionably avail themselves of every 
faux pas in the formation of the constitution, if they do not give 
a more open, active opposition. In addition to these, the licentiousness of the people on one hand, and sanguinary punishments 
on the other, will alarm the best disposed friends to the measure, 
and contribute not a little to the overthrow of their object. Great 
temperance, firmness, and foresight are necessary in the movements of that body. To forbear running from one extreme to 
another is no easy matter, and should this be the case, rocks 
and shelves, not visible at present, may wreck the vessel, and 
give a higher toned despotism than the one which existed be 
fore. I am, dear Sir, &LC.
