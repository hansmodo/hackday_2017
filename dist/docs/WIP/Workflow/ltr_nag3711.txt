Sir, 
</p><p>
My public letter will inform your Excellency of 
the success of the troops under the command of General Morgan. The event is glorious ; and I am exceedingly unhappy that our wretched condition will 
not permit our improving it to the best advantage. 
I shall do all I can, but our prospects are gloomy. 
Our force is small, and daily declining. We have no 
clothing or provisions but what we collect from day 
to day ; and the enemy's late excursion into Virginia 
I apprehend, will cut off our prospects from that 
quarter. I hope your Excellency will repeat your 
letters to Congress upon the necessity of filling the 
army, and forming magazines of provision and forage. 
We never can be fortunate but that it operates to 
our disadvantage ; and above half the pleasure that 
results from the victory is lost in the apprehension that it will relax the preparations for the support of the war. I wish your Excellency to place 
this event in its true point of light to Congress ; 
that if it stands alone it will be of no consequence, 
but, if properly improved upon, it may have the 
most salutary effects. 
</p><p>
What your Excellency mentioned in your last private letter to me is very just; the Commanding Officer has a collective view of all the difficulties in the 
different departments. But, when I was with the 
Northern army, I had a pretty good opportunity of 
knowing the difficulties, from being at the head of 
one of the great departments, and from the confidence which you were pleased to honor me with. 
</p><p>
In comparing the difficulties of the northern service with this of the southern, one bears but a small 
proportion to the other â€” whether from the make of 
the country, the divisions among the inhabitants, the 
difficulty of obtaining supplies, or the unequal force 
we have to contend with. And my spirits would 
sink under the load, was it not from a persuasion 
that, to whatever straits I may be reduced, or however unfortunate I may be, from the hazards I am 
obliged to run, your Excellency will do justice to 
my intentions. I have one consolation, which is, I 
have the confidence of the troops, and the good will 
of the officers. But the unsettled state of the different lines in point of rank, multiplies our embarrassments ; nor can I see the least prospect of bringing 
them to a speedy close. 
</p><p>
I hope <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> writes your Excellency respecting the enemy's movements in Virginia, as I 
have desired him to be very particular, and keep 
you constantly informed of every material circumstance. I beg my respectful compliments to Mrs. 
Washington, and to all the gentlemen of your family. I am, with esteem and regard. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
