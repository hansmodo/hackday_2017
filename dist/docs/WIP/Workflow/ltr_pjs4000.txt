My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When I did myself the pleasure to write you on the 17th ult., I was not apprized of the enemy's progress up Hudson's 
River, nor of the barbarous devastation they have been 
guilty of committing at <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a>, and other places in the 
vicinity. It is no consolation to me that I have so many 
fellow-sufferers : I feel, however, a very sensible one, in 
the fate which has attended <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. 
</p><p>
Is it not probable that the enemy, in a future campaign, 
will make another attempt to sail up Hudson River? If 
they do, and at the same time attack the Eastern States, 
will there not be a want of bread in those States 1 As in 
that case little or none can be conveyed to that quarter, 
would it not be prudent to form very considerable magazines of flour on the east side of the Green Mountains ? And 
does it not appear necessary to throw such obstructions in 
Hudson River, as to render it impracticable for shipping to 
penetrate beyond the highlands 1 Perfectly to obstruct the 
navigation of Hudson River is certainly a very arduous 
task, but not attended with so many difficulties as may at 
first view be imagined. And I am persuaded, that a spirited director, at the head of four hundred men, would 
completely prepare every thing in the course of the winter, 
so as to sink the works in the course of six weeks after the 
ice shall have quitted the river. The British engineers and 
officers confess, that if the works in the Lake, at Ticondel, had been completed, it would have been impossible to 
have opened a passage in less than ten days, if they had 
been possessed of every requisite for such a business, and 
if not the least molestation had been given them. Very 
early in the war I urged the necessity of securing Hudson 
River ; I have repeated my wish more than once, and I 
shall be extremely happy to see a business completely executed, on which I am persuaded much of the safety of the 
United States in general, and this in particular, depends. 
If I had any interest with the Senate and Assembly, I should 
venture to address them on the subject ; but as I have not, 
I must leave it to you, if yon are in sentiment with me on 
the necessity of the work, to mention it to your friends in 
both Houses. 
</p><p>
As I shall shortly be altogether out of public life, I am 
earnestly engaged in building me a house at this place, that 
I may be as far out of the noise and bustle of the great 
world as possible. I am confident (provided we repel the 
enemy), that I shall enjoy more true felicity in my retreat, 
than ever w T as experienced by any man engaged in public 
life. My hobby-horse has long been a country life ; I dismounted with reluctance, and now saddle him again with a 
very considerable share of satisfaction (for the injurious 
world has not been able to deprive me of the best source of 
happiness, the approbation of my own heart), and hope to 
canter him gently on to the end of the journey of life. 
</p><p>
When Congress will send for me to inquire into my conduct, I cannot even make a guess at. I have entreated that 
it may be soon, and respectfully observed, that from my 
past services I ought not to remain longer than needs must 
be in the disagreeable situation in which I now stand. 
</p><p>
Where are you lodged â€” and where is your father's family ? Can I be of any service ? Some tory tenants of mine 
have lost fine farms, either for grain or stock, between this 
and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> ; two or three of them in good fence, with small 
tenements on them. If these or any of them can be of any 
use, I am sure they are much at your service. What further buildings are necessary may be cheaply and speedily 
erected, as the frame of a whole house can be sawed, boards 
and every other material procured at the cheapest rates. 
I will not let any of these farms, except such as I am confident would not do for you, until I have the pleasure of hearing from you ; or rather, until I have had the happiness of 
giving you a bed in the new house, which I began upon on 
the 1st instant, and which will be under cover, and have 
two rooms finished by the 15th instant, unless the weather 
should prove remarkably wet : but observe that it is only a 
frame house, sixty feet long, twenty-one broad, and two 
stories high, filled in with brick. 
</p><p>
I hope pains will be taken to recruit our army ; we ought 
not to grow negligent, and trust too much to our good fortune : there is danger in too much confidence, and I apprehend that Britain, like a desperate gamester whose affairs 
are on the brink of ruin, will make a bold push to retrieve 
the loss, if yet it is possible. 
</p><p>
Pray make my compliments to the governor, the chancellor, speaker, R. Yates, and such other of my friends as 
are in your quarter. I do not mention Morris, because I 
hear he is gone to relieve <a href='/results.php?tla=jad' rel='colleague'>Mr. Duane</a>. It is rather hard 
upon the latter to be obliged to such a constant attendance. 
Adieu : my best wishes attend you through life. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, with great esteem and affection, 
</p><p>
Your obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="me">Philip Schuyler</a>.
