Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
You have enclosed the duplicate of an agreement with Mons. du Coudray, of my orders for clothing, stores, &c., of 
my agreement with Baron de Kalb and others of his train, also with the Comte de Monau and his, which I hope will be agreeable, also the agreement for freight of the ships, which 
I was assured by letters from Bordeaux and elsewhere was as low as could be procured. At the same time, if it is 
above the stated price, in such cases I am promised an abatement. I hope the peculiarity of my situation, and the 
anxious desire I have of forwarding aid to my country, will be considered if any of the articles are thought high. Men 
cannot be engaged to quit their native country and friends, to hazard life and all in a cause, which is not their own 
immediately, at the same easy rate as men will do who are 
fighting literally pro oris et focis, and it is a universal custom in Europe to allow something extra to foreigners, but 
my allowances are very much below the rates here for officers in the same station. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the most profound respect for 
the Congress, Sec.
