Sir, 
</p><p>
I returned last evening, and now send you the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> papers of the 3d and 5th instant. You will much oblige 
me, by informing me what resolutions Congress have come to on my letters of the 26th, 27th, and 30th ult. as well as on the petitions I have repeatedly made to them for the 
settlement of the business, on which I was ordered to return to America. If nothing has been done, I pray to be informed when I may depend on a decisive answer from Congress. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the most sincere respect, 
</p><p>
