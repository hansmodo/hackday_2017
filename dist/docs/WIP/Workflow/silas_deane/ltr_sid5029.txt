Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter, No. 1 . of this date, gives you the state of Captain Bell's proceedings and the circumstances attending it. 
to this I mean to give you a short view of the conduct of this Court, with respect to American ships of war, private as 
well as public, which I cannot well do without giving you a history of facts. 
</p><p>
You know that when I left America the naval armaments were but beginning by the Congress, and the inquiry was 
hardly made, even by individuals, whether foreign powers would admit our cruisers and their prizes. After my arrival 
the question was first started by Captain Lee of Marblehead, at Bilboa, of which I gave you an account in my letters of October and November last. Captain Lee carried 
no prize into Bilboa with him, and the question turned simply on the complaint of the English Consul, charging him 
with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of English vessels. The commissary or 
governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to Court 
for directions, and received orders to set the vessel at liberty ; which orders were accompanied with a general declaration, that his Catholic Majesty was neuter in the dispute 
between England and America. Though the issue of this business was favorable, it was not direct to the point ; we 
wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general. 
</p><p>
In my letters of October and November last, some of 
which must have been received, I repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas. The first that arrived was the Reprisal with two prizes ; this caused much speculation, and at our first audience after, 
we were told, that by the treaties subsisting between France and England, ships of war belonging to any foreign power 
at war with either could not be admitted into their ports, unless driven by stress of weather, or want of provisions, etc. 
and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours, or until the}/ had taken on 
board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states, he. as you will see in the 
treaty of commerce of <a href='/results.php?year=1713'>1713</a>, confirmed by all the subsequent treaties. At the same time we were given to understand, that every favor and indulgence compatible with the 
treaties would be shewn us, and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence 
to England. The hint was taken, the prizes disposed of, and the Reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise ; which 
she made on die coast of Spain, taking, among other English prizes, die packet boat from Lisbon ; with which Captain Wickes returned to port L'Orient. On this the English Ambassador complained loudly, and the English merchants 
were alarmed. Insurance rose in London, and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes 
thru detention of Captain Wickes, or a declaration of war. This Court then ordered the prizes as well as Capt. Wickes 
to leave the port in twenty four hours. The former were sent out but sold to French merchants, and Captain Wickes, 
his ship being leaky, was permitted to stay. Soon after this, Captain Johnson arrived in the <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, and we, 
having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet, altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser, 
and sent her and the <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a> out under the command of 
Captain Wickes as commodore, with the design of intercepting the Irish linen ships ; but by contrary winds, and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships, they were unsuccessful as to the main object ; but as they sailed quite 
round Ireland, and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen 
sail of vessels, they most effectually alarmed England, prevented the great fair at Chester, occasioned insurance to 
rise, and even deterred the English merchants from shipping goods in English bottoms at any rate, so that in a few 
weeks forty sail of French ships were loading in the Thames on freight ; an instance never before known. 
</p><p>
But upon this, the English Ambassador complained in a 
higher tone, and gave us much difficulty ; the prizes however were disposed of, though at a prodigious loss, and 
Captain Wickes set about repairing and refitting the Reprisal, which had been obliged to throw over her guns, and saw 
some of her beams, to escape a seventy four gun ship, which 
chased her and the <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a> on their return from their 
cruise. But before he was refitted, orders were sent from 
Court to detain his vessel and the <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, until further orders. This was owing partly to Captain Wickes having 
repeatedly come into the ports of France with prizes, and refitted his ship for fresh cruises, it being directly contrary to the treaty, which they pretend to hold sacred, and partly 
to the transaction at Duulvirk and the consequent threatenings of the British Ministry. In this situation Captain Wickes and Captain Johnson remain at present. Soon after Mr Hodge's arrival, we bought a lugger at Dover, 
and sent her to Dunkirk. Mr Hodge went after her and equipped her with great secrecy, designing a blow in the North Sea. He sent Captain Cunningham in her, and 
ordered him to intercept the packet between England and Holland, and then to cruise northward towards the Baltic, Cunningham fell in with the packet in a day or two after 
leaving Dunkirk, and took her. As she had a prodigious number of letters on board, he imagined it was proper he should return to Dunkirk instead of continuing his course ; in his return he also took a brig of some value, and brought 
both prizes into port. This spread the alarm far and wide, and gave much real ground of complaint, as he had been entirely armed and equipped in Dunkirk, and had returned 
thither with his prizes. The Ministry, therefore, to appease England ordered the prizes to be returned, and Cunningham and his crew to be imprisoned, which gave the English a temporary triumph. 
</p><p>
But not discouraged thereby, another cutter was bought and equipped completely in the port of Dunkirk. Cunningham and his crew were set at liberty, and with some 
address and intrigue he got again to sea from the same port, in a swift sailing cutter, mounting fourteen six pounders and twenty two swivels, with one hundred and six 
men. His first adventure greatly raised insurance on the northern trade, even the packet boats from Dover to Calais were for some time insured. On his leaving the port of 
Dunkirk the second time, he had orders to proceed directly for America, but lie and his crew, full of resentment for the insults they had received from the enemy whilst in prison at 
Dunkirk, and afterwards, attacked the first vessels they met with, and plundered and burnt as they went on. Our last accounts are, that they had taken or destroyed about 
twenty sail, and had appeared off the town of Lynn and 
threatened to burn it unless ransomed ; but the wind proving unfavorable, they could not put their threats into execution. In a word, Cunningham, by his first and second 
bold expeditions, is become the terror of all the eastern coast of England and Scotland, and is more dreaded than Thurot was in the late war. But though this distresses 
our enemies, it embarrasses us. We solicited his enlargement, and Mr Hodge engaged for his going directly for America. I know not how his engagement was expressed, 
but to appease the British Ministry and drive off an instant war, Mr Hodge has been arrested and confined. His 
friends need not be in distress for him ; he will soon be at liberty. He merits much from his country, having been ready at all times to promote and serve its interests. 
</p><p>
Just before the sailing of Cunningham, Captain Burrall arrived in a Maryland pilot boat. He made several prizes 
in his passage, and brought one into Cherbourg with him. He came to Paris for our advice, but on his return suffered 
himself to be enticed on board an English cutter in the port, where he was instantly seized, and the cutter came to 
sail and carried him off prisoner. We complained, and were promised that he should be reclaimed by this Court ; 
it has probably been done, but we have received no answer. The ship General Mifflin, after cruising some time on the 
coasts of England and Ireland, put into Brest, and there, under Continental colors, saluted the admiral, who, after 
consulting his officers, returned the salute, which causes much speculation, and shows that the officers, as well as the 
other orders in this kingdom, are much in our interest. 
But the politics of this Court are intricate, and embarrassed with connexions and alliances on the continent of 
Europe, which, with the state of their fleet, and their sailors being abroad in the fishery, he. puts off bold and decisive 
measures. Some other prizes have arrived in different ports, particularly two valuable Jamaica men sent into 
Nantes a few days since, by Captains Babson and Hendricks. 
</p><p>
This is a brief account of the proceedings of our cruisers, who have put into the ports of this kingdom. The prizes 
are sold without condemnation, and consequently to a great loss, as the whole is conducted secretly, and put too much 
in the power of the agents. Though these cruisers have 
not been profitable to us, they have been of infinite prejudice to our enemies, both in their commerce and reputation. I will not add to this, as I shall write another letter by this conveyance. 
</p><p>
I beg my best compliments to Mrs Morris, and that you will believe me ever, dear sir, yours, etc.

P. S. Since writing the above the two Jamaica prizes are, by order of Court, arrested, and it remains doubtful 
whether they will not be restored to the original proprietors. The captain of one of the privateers on his passage took on 
board a lady, who was prisoner on board an American privateer, bound for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This he did from motives of 
humanity. On his arrival at Painbeuf, she wrote to her brother, a merchant at Nantes, who came down, and 
hoping to get the consignment of the prizes, officiously advised the captain to report them as ships laden at St Eustatia, which they did, and on their arrival at Nantes consigned the prizes to Messrs Lee & Williams, who immediately made a private sale of them. Meantime the owners 
being acquainted with the proceeding, and knowing that the ships and cargoes, by being regularly entered, were in the 
hands of the custom house, lodged claims, showing that they had been falsely entered, and were English property 
captured by American privateers, and consequently by treaty could not be sold in France. This obliged the 
government to arrest die prizes or openly violate the treaty. Mr Williams came up a few days since, and presented a 
memorial on the subject, but I fear he will receive an unfavorable answer. Orders are received for Captains Wickes 
and Johnson to depart the ports of France. I purpose sending duplicates of this letter by each of them. I cannot 
omit any opportunity of doing justice to these gentlemen, their officers and seamen, whose conduct has been such as 
merits the approbation of their countrymen, and has given reputation to our navy in France. They will not be able 
to carry out any goods, though we had purchased some with a design of sending by them, particularly a quantity of 
saltpetre. This, with other articles to a considerable amount, will be sent in the course of this and the next 
month. I have received letters a few days since, advising that Captain Cunningham was at Ferrol. I know not 
where he designs next, having nothing directly from him.
