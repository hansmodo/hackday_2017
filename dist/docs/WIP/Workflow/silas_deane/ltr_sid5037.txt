</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In consequence of an order of Congress on the 8th of December, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, for me to embrace the first opportunity 
of returning to America, and " upon my arrival to repair with all possible despatch to Congress, that they might be 
well informed of the state of affairs in Europe in that critical juncture," I left Paris the 1st of April last, having 
received the order on the 4th of March preceding, and arrived in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, the seat of Congress, on the 13th 
of July following, ready at the pleasure of Congress to render such information as was in my power to give. In this 
situation I continued until the 15th of August, when I received the order of Congress to attend them on the 17th, 
on which day, and on the 21 st, I had the honor personally to inform Congress generally, of my public transactions 
under their authority from the time of my departure from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in March, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, until my return. 
</p><p>
In these audiences, I particularly stated and explained the unsettled state, in which the commercial transactions of 
the commissioners in Europe were at my departure, and that as well from their nature and extent, as that even at 
my departure from Paris many large orders were not completed, and of consequence, neither the accounts or vouchers 
delivered ; that the interval between my receiving my order of recall, and my departure in compliance with it was so 
short, as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further, than to be able to give a general state of 
them, which I then mentioned generally, and added, that I was under the necessity of returning speedily to Europe, as 
well on account of those, as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled slate. At my last 
audience, I found and expected, that I should be called upon to answer questions, which might be put to me for the 
obtaining more clear and explicit information, than what I had given of some particulars in my general narration, and 
I held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of Congress for that purpose. In this situation my private affairs 
pressed my immediate departure from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and my public as well as private affairs in Europe no less urged 
my departure from America. On the 8th of September, I took the liberty of reminding that honorable body, that I 
was still waiting to receive their orders, if they desired my further attendance upon diem, and my affairs daily pressing, 
on the 11th of September, I again reminded Congress of 
my waiting their pleasure, and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed mc to be anxious for their 
immediate decision. As Congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters, nor to admit me to lay 
before them such further information as they may desire, and I am enabled to give, and as from the many weighty 
affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when I may be admitted, and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I take the liberty of enclosing to 
your Excellency the account of the banker, in whose hands all the public monies were deposited, of which I gave you 
some time since a general state for your private information, and which I obtained from the banker but a day or 
two before my departure from Paris, with the view of giving 
all the information in my power on every subject to Congress, in which they were interested, and which account I 
expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to Congress. 
</p><p>
As to any other subject on which further information may be desired, I shall be ready to give it, whenever that 
honorable body shall call on me for it, during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city. I have 
indeed thought that some further information would be necessary; I have daily expected to be called upon for it. 
On this consideration alone, I have, notwithstanding the pressing circumstances I have found myself in, waited with 
patience the orders of Congress. I shall be happy if such information or any other service in my power may be found 
agreeable and of use to that respectable body and the United States, to whom I have long since, and ever shall 
be devoted. I have only further to request that honorable body to be assured, that I shall ever retain a most grateful 
sense of the confidence, which they have heretofore honored me with, and consider it as the most honorable and happy 
circumstance of my life, that I have had the opportunity of rendering important services to my country, and that I am 
conscious of having done them to the utmost of my ability. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to remain, with the utmost respect, etc.
