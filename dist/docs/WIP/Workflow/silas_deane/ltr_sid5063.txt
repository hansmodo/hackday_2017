</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
As this will probably be the last time I shall trouble Congress with my addresses to them, I hope to be indulged in 
briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation. 
</p><p>
From the moment, that the contest between these States and Great Britain became serious, I have taken and pursued 
a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country, have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune, and exposed 
my life, for an object much dearer to me than either, the peace, liberty, and safety of these States. The part I took 
in the first, and succeeding Congress, is well known to many of the honorable members now present, as well as to my 
countrymen and fellow citizens in general, who must do me the justice to say, that I let slip no opportunity either in 
Congress or out, which offered, for serving America, and distressing its enemies. 
</p><p>
In January, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, when I was about returning to my family and private concerns, which had suffered much by my 
absence, I was applied to, by the committee of Congress, to 
go to France, to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of America in that kingdom. The advantages 
proposed to me in the latter were considerable, and without any probability of difficulty, embarrassment, or risk, further 
than the dangers of the voyage, which were indeed great at 
that time. In the former it was very different, but the difficulties which presented, great as they were, had no consideration with me, in the situation in which our affairs then 
were. My subsequent conduct, from my arrival in France, until I left that kingdom, fully demonstrates that private 
interest and personal safety never had any weight with me, when the service of my country called upon me. In my 
narrative I have been so particular on the situation I found myself in, on my arrival in Europe, the embarrassments and 
difficulties I constantly labored under, and had to encounter, and in the many letters I have written to Congress since 
my return, requesting my conduct might be examined, in 
the strictest and most public manner, I have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had 
ever been, that I am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present. 
</p><p>
On the fourth of March, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these States, which fell almost solely 
on me, and having, jointly with my colleagues, concluded the 
treaty of the sixth of February, which secured and guarantied the independence of these Slates, when I found myself, 
for the first time after my leaving America, free from those 
distressing embarrassments and difficulties I had been constantly under, and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects 
in view, and which I had for some time contemplated for 
the service of these State?, I received the resolution of Congress of the 8th of December, ordering me to return immediately to America, to inform Congress of the state of foreign affairs in Europe. I did not hesitate a moment as to the 
part I should take, but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others, which then fortunately coincided, to the greatest possible advantage of these States, â€” the 
publication of the treaty, until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret, and the sending out the Toulon fleet, in which I embarked early in April. 
</p><p>
I submit to the consideration of Congress, whether from the 4th of March to the 30th, the day I left Paris, I could possibly have been better employed, and whether I could 
have justified myself, or been even excused by others, had I neglected these objects, and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of Congress, for the mere 
purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the 
different parts of France ; accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months, and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself. 
</p><p>
I say I submit this to the consideration of Congress, nor do I fear publicly to submit it to the world, or even to those enemies whom I am so unfortunate as to have in it. 
The voice of my friend and colleague, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Doctor Franklin</a>, with that of my other noble friends and patrons in France to me was, - "Lose not a moment on any object either 
public or private ; the fleet at Toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there ; by no means let it wait a moment for you ; you may sail early in April, and be in America in 
the course of the month of May ', you may finish the information you have to give Congress immediately, and return to France by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement ." It cannot be supposed, that I wanted to be urged to take the part I did ; on the contrary, I exerted myself to the utmost in my power 
to get away as early and as secretly as possible, being convinced that the plan was well laid, happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it, and sensible how much 
depended on despatch. Never was there a more glorious 
prospect before us than at that time, nor ever were my 
hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion. 
</p><p>
Having been honored with the particular confidence, and I may say friendship, of the minister, and knowing that the 
relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival, I suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment. I was not 
insensible that I had enemies in America ; I knew well that I had them in France, in Mr William and Mr Arthur Lee, 
and I was well acquainted with their connexions in America ; but conscious of the part I had acted, and of the services I had rendered, and was then doing, for my country, 
which services were not in words, but in acts, the most honorable testimonials of which, given by the highest and first 
characters in Europe or America, I had in my hands, I had nothing to apprehend. Though permit me to assure you, that had I at the time foreseen all that has happened, and 
that even my life, as well as reputation, were to be sacrificed on my return, to the interested views of my enemies, I should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part I 
actually did take at the time. On my arrival early in July, I repaired immediately to Congress, and informed them I waited their orders. 
</p><p>
It was late in August before I had the honor of an audience. many circumstances, as well as direct information, convinced me, of what I had before suspected, that ill offices 
had been done me, and my conduct misrepresented. When I was first heard before Congress, I therefore requested, that if anything had been alleged against any part of my 
conduct, or character, as the public agent and commissioner of Congress, I might be made acquainted therewith, and have an opportunity for an explanation. I received no 
answer, and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me. I was told by many of the 
honorable members, that they knew of none, nor had they heard of any. Conversing with an honorable friend of mine, I mentioned to him my expectation of returning to 
France early in the fall, on which he told me I must not expect it, for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way, as most probably would 
detain me here much longer than I thought for. I asked him how it was possible, when the business I was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished, and 
when the unclosed state in which I had been obliged to leave many public transactions in Europe, made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public, as well as to 
myself, and especially when nothing had, nor, I presumed, could be, alleged against me. He answered, that it was the design of those, who wished to sacrifice me to the family 
interests and emoluments of my enemies, to wear me out by delays, and, without any direct charges, to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations, hints, and 
innuendoes, that though I might with confidence rely on the justice of Congress, yet measures would be taken to delay
it on one pretence or other, in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me. Though I could by no means 
bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time, yet they made me more attentive to what was passing, and my observations served to confirm them. 
</p><p>
The many fruitless applications I made for near five months to obtain an audience of Congress, and to have the 
business I came out upon closed, are well known to Congress, and the inferences I drew from the silent neglects, which my requests met with, may be easily conceived. In 
this situation I determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens, to whom I considered myself ultimately accountable, though immediately so to their 
representatives in Congress. In consequence of this determination,! published my address in the beginning of December. On the 5th, Congress resolved to hear me ; on the 
7th I attended, and was ordered to report in writing my agency of their affairs in Europe, as soon as may be, etc. 
In obedience to their commands, I delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions, from the time of my leaving America, and flattered myself, that, from the 
time which had elapsed from my recall, which was more than twelve months, and more than five from the time of my return and attendance, the fullest examination must 
have been made into every part of my conduct, and that I could not fail of obtaining an easy decision. Confident in 
the justice of Congress, I forbore to address the public further, whilst my cause was before Congress, and whilst I 
daily expected their determination. From these considerations, I silently submitted to the torrent of abuse, misrepresentation, and calumny, which almost daily poured 
forth against me in the public papers. 
</p><p>
I considered myself as the servant of Congress, and entitled to their protection ; to them I constantly appealed, not for favors, I asked none, but for justice. It is now five 
months since I laid my narrative before Congress, and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to 
examine and report on Foreign Affairs, and that my narrative was referred to them, I applied repeatedly to several 
of the honorable members, and requested that, if in the course of their examination they met with anything, in the letters and documents before them, respecting my conduct, 
which required explanation, they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith. I was not notified to attend them on the subject, and though I am informed their report has 
been for several weeks before Congress, I am unacquainted with its contents, as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made. 
</p><p>
Since I had the honor of laying my narrative before Congress, I have repeatedly solicited for the decision of Congress, but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to 
the many letters I have written ; it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them ; it would take some time to refer to the dates only ; they are 
before Congress, and to them I appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public, or that of an innocent but greatly injured 
free citizen. I have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these States ; 
I have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time, and I freely rest my merits in that department on facts, and 
on the testimony of those great personages, who best know 
what my conduct was, and who have generously, and without solicitation from me, publicly declared their approbation of it. With respect to my commercial, I have appealed 
and again appeal to that mode of trial, which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether I have embezzled or misapplied the public monies, or whether, for more than 
three years' faithful services, I have received anything more than my private expenses. I have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts 
of the commissioners settled, on the issue of which I freely put my reputation, and every thing dear in life. My solicitations have been unsuccessful, whilst my enemies, taking 
the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving France, raise a cry against me and say â€” where are his accounts ? why did he not bring 
them out ? if they were not settled, why did he not stay and settle them ? I must confess, that when I reflect that these very men owe their present political, as well as personal, 
safety, to the measure I then look, I am at a loss which prevails most in my mind, indignation or contempt. 
</p><p>
I trust Congress will indulge me. and the rather as I hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon, whilst I ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that 
honorable body, coolly to review the scenes I have passed through, and to place himself in the different situations I have been in at different periods, since my engaging in this 
great and important contest, and consider me, after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part, after having for more 
than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country, more than three of which have been in the immediate service of Congress ; after bavins:, under 
every disadvantage and embarrassment, successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these States ; after having been the principal actor in concluding 
an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these States, and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from His 
Most Christian Majesty and his ministers, as well as from my friend and colleague, and the French nation in general ; 
and with an armament, which promised, on its sailing, complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these States, 
and which, notwithstanding its misfortunes, relieved them (this capital in particular) from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger ; after this, to be obliged to 
waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character, and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect, 
driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune, and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited 
reproaches into obscurity, poverty, and exile ; â€” I ask every member of that honorable body, even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me, to put themselves for a few 
moments in my case, which I have by no means colored beyond the real life, and then pass sentence. 
</p><p>
The loss of interest has little weight with me, nor loss of time, infinitely more precious, if by either, the honor, safety, and prosperity of these States is promoted. In the present 
case I am deprived even of this consolation, having seen, to my inexpressible grief, the essential interests of these States sacrificed by the very measures, which have occasioned 
the delay of justice to me. I still glory in the character of a free American citizen, and when I fear to speak in the style of one, I shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of 
all titles. It was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens ; I have made them in the most decent and urgent manner, 
and repeatedly. They have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect, even whilst every thing dear in 
life to me, and more than life itself, my reputation, was suffering. I thank God I have sufficient fortitude to part with 
everything in life, and life itself, in the service of my country, without repining ; but no consideration whatever shall 
induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified, whilst I have the power either to 
act or speak. For ten months past I have presented myself and my case before Congress, such as could b} no 
means be considered in a neutral point of light, but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure. I have not 
been able to obtain either. Justice, therefore, to my countrymen and fellow citizens, to myself, and those great and 
generous personages who protected and patronized me, and the cause I was charged with abroad, requires of me that I justify myself before the world, by laying before 
them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first, and of the treatment I have met with. 
</p><p>
In doing this, (if laid under the necessity,) I shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency, nor be wanting in that respect, which I have ever 
paid, and shall ever pay to Congress, as the representative body of my fellow citizens. At the same time, I shall with proper firmness, and the dignity becoming a free but injured 
citizen, expose to public view those, whether in Congress or out, who, to promote partial, interested, and family 
views, have from the first systematically labored to prevent Congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant 
of the public, though the interest of these States called for their decision. I flatter myself I shall not be laid under the necessity of further application, but that Congress will 
relieve me from the unmerited distress I labor under by closing this long protracted affair, or at least by immediately taking such measures as will, without delay, do justice to 
my services. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the most respectful esteem 
</p><p>
and attachment, &:c.
