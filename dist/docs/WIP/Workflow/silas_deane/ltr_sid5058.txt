</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
As I have received no reply to my letters of the 30th ult. and 2d instant, I take the liberty of applying again to 
Congress, to remind them of my situation. It is now more than twelve months since, in obedience to their orders, I 
left France, to return to my native country. Having employed the short interval, between the receiving advice of 
my recall and my embarking, in soliciting essential aid and succor for these States, I entered on my voyage with the 
pleasing reflection, that after a two years' faithful service, in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation, the issue had 
been fortunate, equal to my utmost wishes ; that the supplies I had procured, and sent out, had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy ; that the treaty which I had the honor, with my colleagues, 
to conclude, had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world lo guaranty the liberties and independence of these States. 
</p><p>
The great and seasonable aid sent out by him, with which (after having received the most honorable testimonials of his 
approbation, and men of his esteem, as well as that of his ministers, and of my late worthy colleague and friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>) I had the honor to embark, gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes — the total reduction of the British force in North America. Unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise. Extensive 
and important services were however thereby rendered, on which I need not be particular. Immediately on my landing in America, I repidred with all possible despatch to 
Congress, to inform them of the state of affairs in Europe, which I had been advised, by their resolution, was the business I was ordered to return upon. Between my arrival in 
this city, on the 13th of June, and my audience before Congress, on the 21st of August, I was informed that the minds, of s:) ue i)f my countrymen were prejudiced against me, and 
til it iiisi I I itiOMS were iiidiisli'ioiisly circulated to effect ,.;:->•••: ! t i.;i'ef )ro t xik t';).: eariiesl opportunity given me, 
vng hiid l»L'i''!e Congress a general state of ,o,i;iid;,i ;iifair-. ■.\in\ of li:} p ■>' > edings, to request that if any 
ihlng had been laid to my v . ariie, or suirgested to my disadvantage, I might be made acquainted therewith, for that it 
was probable that in the difficult, complicated, and embarrassed scenes I had gone through, many things might require 
explanation. I received no reply, and continuing to solicit to have the business I returned upon concluded, I was 
informed that an honorable member produced in Congress 
an extract from a letter from a private gentleman, respecting a conversation which passed between him and Mr Carmichael, which implied a censure on my conduct. On the 
26th of September, Mr Secretary Thompson acquainted me with the resolution of Congress of that day, to postpone futrher consideration of my requests, until the examination of William Carmichael. 
</p><p>
What the result of that examination was I never knew, but having waited some days, the urgent necessity for my 
speedy return pressing on me, I applied again, and repeatedly, that I might finish the business upon which I had been 
sent for. Days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose, and I must suppose business of more importance prevented. 
In those letters I laid before Congress the unsettled state in which I had, by my sudden departure, been obliged to leave 
the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners, and pointed out the injuries, which the public 
must suffer by a delay of their settlement, as well as the personal inconveniences I must be subjected to whilst they 
remained unsettled. To these letters I beg leave to refer. In October, extracts from letters from Mr Arthur Lee and 
AJr Izard, were, by order of Congress, delivered mo, to which I replied at large, on the 12th and 22d of the same 
month; my letters are still before Congress, and to them I refer, particularly to that of the 12th, which closes in these words ; 
</p><p>
"As in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account, and every thing goes to the debit or credit, the folio for profit or loss, so I must solicit that <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> 
and Mr Adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to Paris, 
and as there has been a charge made by Mr Lee, of profusion, of extravagant contracts, and the like, that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts, with every 
allegation of the kind, to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot, and that orders may be given, that whatever may be found due from 
the commissioners, or either of them, may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for Congress, and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may 
be the balance, to the person in whose favor the same shall be found. By this means truth will be demonstrated, and justice done, which is all I have ever wished for." 
</p><p>
In December last I was directed to lay before Congress in writing, a narrative of my proceedings, whilst their commercial and political agent, etc. I must ask leave to refer 
to that narrative at large, as many of the honorable members then in Congress are now absent, and the representatives of several of the States entirely changed. On a 
reference it will be found, that I again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct, that the most thorough examination might be made, and to demonstrate 
what my 'commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these States, that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay, that the part I had acted, and 
the station I had been in, could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one, and that approbation or censure was my due, etc. &.c. When I was favored with that 
audience, I flattered myself that the delays I had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny . into every part of my conduct, and that if any charges were 
to be brought against any part of my conduct, I should then be informed of them. I therefore again requested to know if there were any. I was informed of none. Soon 
after I was told that a committee was appointed to examine into, and report on foreign affairs. I previously informed Congress, that I had no copies of the letters written to them 
by the commissioners, from Paris ; that <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Doctor Franklin</a> took the care of them, and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them, I had not taken duplicates 
with me, therefore requested that I might have copies of them, that I might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory. 
</p><p>
I afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee, desiring that if in the course of their examination, anything should appear doubtful, or such as might 
support a charge against any part of my conduct, I might be heard, before any report should be made. I did not receive copies of the letters, nor was I ever called upon by 
the committee, who I am informed have made their report, as to which I am wholly uninformed. Soon after this report was delivered to Congress, having been persecuted 
in the public papers for several months, in the most scandalous, virulent, and licentious manner, and accused before 
the public of crimes of the blackest complexion, I again addressed myself to Congress, and as their servant claimed their protection, and that I might be heard in the most public 
manner, or in any other way they thought proper. This letter, of the 30th of March, remains unanswered, and I now pray the contents of it may be considered. The part 
I acted as political agent and commissioner for Congress is well known, and may be judged of with certainly at this time, and the settlement of mine and the commissioners' 
accounts (which I have repeatedly solicited) will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been. If, in^e commercial, I have not acted with prudence and integrity, 
if I have neglected lo supply these States with stores to the utmost of my power, and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies, the interest of the public requires that 
speedy justice be done, and the settlement of the commissioners' accounts will at once acquit or condemn me. If in my political department I have in any instance neglected 
or betrayed the interests of my country, if I have conducted weakly or wickedly, or both, the public ought to know it, 
and I ought to be punished. If, on the contrary, I sacrificed all private considerations, and put my life as well as 
fortune to the hazard, to procure relief and assistance for these States from abroad ; if, unsupported by remittances from hence, without credit or friends, and a stranger to the 
language and manners of the country I was sent to negotiate in, I surmounted every obstacle, and in a few months 
obtained and sent out large supplies ; if I was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in France, in 
the commercial as well as political affairs of these States, at times even to my personal danger ; if, so far from having embezzled the public monies, I neglected my private 
fortune, and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business; if a principal share of the 
political negotiations fell on me, and if jointly with my colleagues I brought them to a happy and honorable issue, and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of 
His Most Christian Majesty and his minister's, as well as of the nation in general ; and if, at my private solicitations (in 
part) after my recall, a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these Slates ; if these are facts, which they certainly are, and the greater part of them long since 
further ascertained, and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners' accounts, (which I have from the first requested) I flatter myself justice will be done by 
Congress, and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it, and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially, than injustice itself would do. 
</p><p>
I, therefore, with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man, and with the firmness of a free independent citizen, ask for justice, fully confident that Congress will not refuse 
or delay it. I owe too much to those great personages, who generously patronized and protected me in Europe, to my countrymen and to myself, to suffer my character and 
conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty. When the part I acted abroad in the service of these States, my recall, the circumstances of my return, my reception, and 
the delays I have since met with, are reviewed, I think my case will be found peculiar. 
</p><p>
Permit me then to repeat, that my services have been in two departments, political and commercial ; every thing respecting the first is already well known, the closing of the 
accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been ; on the first, Congress is now able to judge ; justice to the public, as well as to myself, calls for their determination. If there 
are charges against me in either of the characters I have supported, I must consider myself entitled to know what they arc, and to be permitted to answer. 
</p><p>
I cannot close this letter without complaining to Congress of the abuse I have met with in the public papers from a writer, who was lately their confidential servant, and who 
has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these States, and to injure me in the public opinion ; also of the parii^d and injurious manner in which 
I have been treated by others who, deeply interested by 
family and other connexions to support my enemies, represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself, as inconsistent and contradictory, whilst 
I remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them. My utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these States, and to merit the title of their faithful and approved 
servant ; nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity. If my country have no further service for me, my first object as well as 
ray duty must be to justify my conduct, and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men, and to do this I again ask of Congress, what 
I consider as my right, their decision on my conduct as their servant ; and if any part thereof is questioned, I may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same, which I 
have often said and again repeat, the settlement of the commissioners' accounts will enable me to do, even to mathematical demonstration. Any further delay in my case must 
have all the consequences of a refusal, and as I have ever relied with confidence on the justice of Congress, and long waited their decision, I flatter myself it will no longer be 
postponed. I shall leave <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in the course of this week on my private affairs, and wish to do it as early as possible. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with much respect, &c.
