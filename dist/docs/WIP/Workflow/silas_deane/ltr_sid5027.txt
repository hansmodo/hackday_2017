Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
This will be delivered you by Captain Gov, who, with his lieutenant and two sergeants, embarks with thirty field 
pieces, ten ton of powder, ball, lead, he. which I wish safe and in season for service, though delayed beyond my 
expectations. Captain Goy has the best of recommendations from officers of distinction here, and I am confident will be 
found to be of great service in the artillery, a part of which he accompanies. <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> is at present in the country 
in good health, and we shall jointly write you very particularly in a few days ; meantime we are without any intelligence from Congress since he left Philadelphia, in October 
last. I will not attempt to give you an idea of the difficulties, which are the consequence of our being left thus without intelligence, nor the anxiety it occasions in our minds ; 
but must urge you to take some effectual measures for keeping up a correspondence with us in future, without 
which many proposals of the utmost importance to the United States are extremely embarrassed, and in danger of failing. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
With the most profound respect, etc.
