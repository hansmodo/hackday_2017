Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
The several letters you will receive with this, will give you some idea of the situation I have been in for some months 
past, though after all I must refer you to Mr Rogers for 
particulars on some subjects. I should never have completed what I have, but for the generous, the indefatigable 
and spirited exertions of Monsieur Beaumarchais, to whom the United States are on every account greatly indebted ; 
more so than to any other person on this side the water ; he is greatly in advance for stores, clothing, and the like, and 
therefore I am confident you will make him the earliest and most ample remittances. He wrote you by Mr McCrery, 
and will write you again by this conveyance. A nephew of his, a young gentleman of family, education, and spirit, 
makes a voyage to America with Monsieur du Coudray, and is ambitious of serving his first campaigns in your service. 
I recommend him therefore to your particular patronage and protection, as well on account of the great merits of his uncle, 
as on that of his being a youth of spirit and genius ; and just entering the world in a foreign country, he needs protection 
and paternal advice to countenance and encourage him. This I have confidently assured his uncle lie will receive 
from you, and am happy in knowing you will fulfil my engagements on that score, and, in whatever department you 
may fix him, that you will recommend him to the patronage of some person, on whom you may rely to act at once the friendly and the paternal part.

A particular account of die stores shipped may probably not be ready by this vessel, but may go by the next or some 
succeeding one, as several will sail after this on the same errand. Let me by every letter urge on you the sending in 
season a quantity of tobacco, of rice, and flour or wheat. These are articles which cannot fail, and are capital ones ; 
twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco are this instant wanted in France, besides the demand in other kingdoms. I think 
Monsieur Beaumarchais wrote you under the firm of Hortalez & Co. if so, you will address him in the same style ; 
but as I must probably remain here until the arrival of these articles, I can regulate that on the arrival of your despatches. 
I have advised these stores being shipped for some of the New England ports, northeast of Newport first, and if failing 
of making a port there, to stand for the Capes of the Delaware, or for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> in South Carolina, as the most likely 
route to avoid interception. I cannot in a letter do full justice to Monsieur Beaumarchais for his great address and 
assiduity in our cause ; I can only say he appears to have undertaken it on great and liberal principles, and has in the 
pursuit made it his own. His interest and influence, which are great, have been exerted to the utmost in the cause of 
the United States, and I hope the consequences will equal his wishes. I have the honor to be, he.
