Sir, 
</p><p>
The bearer. Viscount Mourreu, is the gentleman of whom I formerly wrote, and who has been long detained by 
a variety of accidents, which he can relate to you at large. The engagements taken with him were previous to the 
arrival of my colleagues, who have not therefore intermeddied in the affair. His character and abilities are high in 
estimation here, and the Comte de Broglio has written in particular to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>. He served under the 
Comte, who commanded the armies of France with reputation in the last war. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
With the most profound respect, &,c.
