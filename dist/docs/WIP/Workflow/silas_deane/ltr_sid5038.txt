Sir, 
</p><p>
Being informed that letters from Mr Izard, reflecting on my character and conduct whilst in the service of the public 
abroad, have been read in Congress, I have to ask that honorable body to grant me copies thereof, and that I may 
be permitted to wait on Congress, and to be heard in my vindication. I have that regard for Mr Izard's opinion of 
my ability and disposition to transact public business, which I ought to have, and am consequently easy on that subject ; 
but facts asserted, which affect either, call for an explanation. Those indeed, which respect myself personally, 
require none before Congress, nor will I trouble that honorable body with the making any ; but those which regard 
my character and conduct as a public minister, and in so important a transaction as that of the late treaties of Paris, 
call on me, as well injustice to the public as to myself, for an explanation, which I am very happy in the having it in 
my power to give, as well as in the confidence I have, that Congress will neither delay nor refuse doing this justice to 
a faithful and greatly injured servant of theirs. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &.c.
