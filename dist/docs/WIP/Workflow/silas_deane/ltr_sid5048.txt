Sir, 
</p><p>
I have now to acknowledge your favors of 10 o'clock last evening, and to thank you for the attention paid to my 
last letter to you. Previous to receiving the intimation you have given me, "that Congress had resolved to take into 
consideration their foreign affairs, and that such branches as I had been particularly concerned in, would in due 
course become subjects of deliberation," I had prepared to leave this city, and had made my arrangements accordingly, 
which it will not be in my power to dispense with for any time. I take the liberty of mentioning this, as I do not 
find in the intimation you have given me of the resolution of Congress any time fixed for my attendance, and I take 
the liberty of repeating what I have before had the honor of writing to you, that my detention is extremely prejudicial to 
my private affairs, and, so far as I am able to judge, in some degree so to those of the public, which I have had the 
honor of being intrusted with, some of which require my presence at the settlement of them, as well on account of 
ray own reputation, as for the interest of the United States. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with much respect, etc. 
</p><p>
