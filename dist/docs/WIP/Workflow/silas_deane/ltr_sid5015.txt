Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
In a former letter I mentioned a naval enterprise, which 
might at first appear romantic, but the more it is considered 
the less danger I shall be in of being taxed on that score. 
Admiral Montague lately returned from the Banks, where 
the fishermen have had a wretched season, in consequence 
of the American privateers. He left two small sloops of war 
there of 14 and 16 guns. In common years they leave six 
or seven thousand of their laborers or fishermen there, as in 
a prison, through the winter, employed in taking seals, 
repairing boats, stages, &c. ; these are unarmed, and ever 
dissatisfied to the last degree with their situation. Two 
frigates arriving early in February would destroy the fishery 
for one if not two years, and obtain an acquisition of a fine 
body of recruits for your navy. I have conferred with some 
persons here on the subject, who highly approve the enterprise, but I submit it to your opinion, after urging despatch 
in whatever is done or attempted on that subject. 
</p><p>
The resolution of the Court of Spain in the case of Capt. Lee, at Bilboa, gives every encouragement to adventurers 
in these seas, where the prizes are valuable, and where you 
have constantly harbors at hand on the coast of France and 
Spain to repair to and refit in, and where constant and certain intelligence can be had of the situation of the British 
ships of war, as well as of commerce. I need not add, on a 
subject so plain, and at the same time so important, but 
will only remind you that the Dutch, in the space of two or 
three years after their first revolt from Spain, attacked the 
Spaniards so successfully and unexpectedly in every quarter 
of the globe, that the treasures they obtained thereby enabled 
them to carry on the war. Let me repeat, that if you empower me or any other person here, you may obtain any 
number of ships of war on credit from individuals, on paying 
interest at five per cent until the principal is discharged. 
The Icing will probably have use for his, and besides, to let 
his go would be the same as a declaration of war, which in 
form at least will for some time be avoided. 
</p><p>
I write on different subjects in my letters, as they rise in 
my mind, and leave you to use as you may judge best my 
sybil leaves, and am, gentlemen, he.
