Sir, 
</p><p>
When I had the honor of waiting on Congress, you were pleased to inform me, that if Congress had any further 
commands for me I should be notified thereof. Not having received any notice from you on the subject, I take the 
liberty to inform you, that my affairs are become so pressing and so peculiarly circumstanced, that it is impossible 
for me to attend longer without doing greater prejudice to myself and interest, than I am able to sustain. I must 
therefore request of you to remind Congress of my situation, and that you will inform me of their determination respecting me. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sincere respect, etc.
