Sir, 
</p><p>
I am without an answer to the letter I did myself the honor of writing to you the 30th ult. As I shall be obliged to leave <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in a few days at farthest, I have again 
to solicit a decisive reply to my last. Justice to ray fortune as well as character requires it, and I can by no means bring myself to suppose, that Congress will ever refuse the doing 
of justice either to the character or fortune of any free citizen of these States, much less that they will any longer delay it to one in their service, and under their immediate 
protection, and who has for many months past been soliciting for justice, as well to his fortune as character. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be. 
</p><p>
With the utmost respect and attachment, etc. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
