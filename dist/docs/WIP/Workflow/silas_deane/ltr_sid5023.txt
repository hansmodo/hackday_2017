Sir, 
</p><p>
I received last evening a letter from my friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, at Nantes, which place he was to leave last sunday morning, so that I expect him in Paris this day, or 
early tomorrow. Meantime I have and shall carefully attend to the hint given me, and am confident he will do the same. 
His arrival is the common topic of conversation, and has given birth to a thousand conjectures and reports, not one 
of which I have given ground for, having constantly declared that I am ignorant of the motives of his voyage, or his business. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.
