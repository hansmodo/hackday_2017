Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mons. Holtzendorff, is a Prussian officer, 
who served the last war in Germany, and with reputation. 
Gentlemen of first character in the army here have recommended him, as an excellent officer both for skill and bravery. I take therefore the liberty of recommending him 
to the service of the United States. He leaves a Major's post there in the army of France, hoping by his services in 
America to advance himself beyond what he can expect in Europe in a time of peace. I shall as soon as possible send 
you a particular account of all my proceedings to the time 
of the arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, which I have in a great measure done already, though in detached parts in different 
letters, some of which may undoubtedly miscarry. 
I am, with much respect, he.
