Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I have purchased two hundred tons of powder, and ordered the sarae to be shipped to Martinique to the care of Mons. Deant, to the direction of Mr Bingham for your use. The first cost is 18 sols per lb. or 10d sterling ; the charges will 
be added ; the amount I have not as yet ascertained, and interest at five per cent until payment. I must again urge 
you to hasten your remittances. Tobacco, rice, indigo, wheat, and flour are in great demand, and must be so through 
the year. Tobacco is nine stivers per lb. in Holland, rice 50s sterling per cwt. Flour is already from 20 to 23 livres 
per cwt. and rising. I have engaged a sale for 20,000 hogsheads of tobacco, the amount of which will establish the 
credit of the Congress with the mercantile interest in France and Holland. 
</p><p>
Let me urge your attention to these articles, though I 
must say your silence ever since the 5th of last June discourages me at times. Indeed it well nigh distracts me. 
From whatever cause the silence has happened, it has greatly 
prejudiced the affairs of the United Colonies of America ; 
and so far as the success of our cause depended on the 
friendship and aid of powers on this side the globe, it has 
occasioned the greatest hazard and danger, and thrown me 
into a state of anxiety and perplexity, which, no words can 
express. I have made one excuse after another, until my 
invention is exhausted, and when I find vessels arriving from 
different ports in America, which sailed late in August, without a line for me, it gives our friends here apprehensions that 
the assertions of our enemies, who say you are negotiating and compounding, are true ; otherwise, say they, where are 
your letters and directions? Surely, they add, if the Colonies were in earnest, and unanimous in their Independence, 
even if they wanted no assistance from hence, common civility would cause them to announce in form their being Independent States. 
</p><p>
I will make no other comment on the distressing subject than this ; were there no hopes of obtaining assistance on 
application in a public manner, I should be easier under your silence, but when the reverse is the case, to lose the present 
critically favorable moment, and hazard thereby the ruin of the greatest cause in which mankind were ever engaged, 
distresses my soul, and I would if possible express something of what I have undergone for the last three months, until 
hope itself has almost deserted me. I do not complain for myself, but for my country, thus unaccountably suffering 
from I know not what causes. 
</p><p>
I am, gentlemen, with most respectful compliments to the Congress, &c.
