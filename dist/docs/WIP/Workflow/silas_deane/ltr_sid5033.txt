Sir, 
</p><p>
I have now the pleasure of acquainting your Excellency of my arrival here yesterday, on board the Languedoc, commanded by his Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='met colleague'>Count D'Estaing</a>, with a 
fleet of twelve sail of the line, and four frigates. We sailed from Toulon the lOth of April last. I presume therefore that I have no intelligence from Europe so late as what you must be possessed of already. Finding that the 
enemy had escaped, the Admiral resolved instantly to pursue them to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and will sail this morning for that 
port, but he has no pilot. If, therefore, pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival, it will be of the utmost service 
to the expedition. I shall embark this afternoon in company with his Excellency, Mons. Gerard, for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your Excellency and die honorable Congress in person, 
and to congratulate you on the late glorious events. I have sent Commodore Nicholson express, who can inform you 
of our situation. Permit me to recommend him as an active, spirited officer, to whom the Admiral has been much 
obliged by his services during our passage. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the most profound respect, 
your Excellency's most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. His Excellency the Admiral desires, that, on the arrival of the pilots at the Hook, where they will find 
his fleet, they would make a signal with a white flag, either on board their boat, if they have one, or from the 
shore, formed in a triangle. Mons. Chouen, who will wait on you with a letter from the Admiral, sets out suddenly, 
and may want money to bear his expenses on his further journey. Mons. Gerard desires he may be supplied on his 
account, with any sum to the amount of twenty thousand livres.
