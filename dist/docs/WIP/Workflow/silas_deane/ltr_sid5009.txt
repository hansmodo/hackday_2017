Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received no letter from you since those of the 4th and 5th of August last, nor any intelligence from Congress 
since the 5th June, which not only surprises but distresses me. I now send to the care of Mons. Deant two hundred 
tons of a necessary article to be at your orders for use of the 
Congress ; the freight is to be paid in Martinique as customary, and I wish you to ship it for the ports of the Colonies, 
in such a manner, and in such quantities in a vessel, as you shall judge most prudent, advising the Congress of your 
having received it, and the methods you are taking to ship it to them, praying them to remit you the amount of the freight, 
as you must make friends in Martinique for advancing the same. 
</p><p>
I wish you could write me oftener, and inform me very 
particularly what letters you receive from me, directed immediately to you, and what letters for other persons. In 
this way I shall know which of my letters fail. 
</p><p>
I am, with great respect, &c. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.

P. S. Forward the enclosed under cover, and with the 
usual directions, in case of capture.
