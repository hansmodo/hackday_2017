Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 7th of August last, covering a copy of yours of the 8th of July, I received, though the original never 
came to hand. This letter also enclosed the Declaration of Independence, with instructions to make it known to this and 
the other powers of Europe ; and I received it the 7th inst. 
though the vessel which brought it had but 38 days passage 
from Salem. This letter was very far from relieving me, as 
it enclosed what had been circulated through Europe for two 
months before, and my pretending to inform this Court would 
be only a matter of form, in consequence of your orders, 
which were expressed in the style of any common affair. 
I certainly prefer simplicity of style, as well as manners, 
but something is due to the dignity of old and powerful states, 
or if you please to their prejudices in favor of long established form and etiquette ; and as the United States of 
America, by this act, introduce themselves among the established powers, and rank with them, it must of course be expected that at the first introduction, or the announcing of it, 
some mode more formal, or if I may so say, more respectful, 
would have been made use of, than simply two or three lines 
from the committee of congress, in a letter something more 
apparently authentic, not that either your power or the reality of your letter could be doubted. I mention it as deserving consideration, whether in your application here and 
your powers and instructions of a public nature, it is not 
always proper to use a seal ? This is a very ancient custom 
in all public and even private concerns of any consequence. 
Further, to keep a proper intercourse with Europe, it is 
by no means sufficient to write a single letter, and leave it to 
be forwarded when the captain of a vessel thinks of it, or has 
nothing else to do. Duplicates of every letter should be 
lodged in every port in the hands of faithful and attentive 
persons, to be forwarded by the first conveyance to any part 
of Europe. Had this been practised since my leaving America, instead of receiving but two short letters from you, I might 
have had intelligence every month ; let me urge you, from 
the danger our affairs have been in of totally miscarrying for 
want of intelligence, to pay some attention to this in future. 
</p><p>
As the copy was dated the eighth of July I took occasion to observe, that the honorable Congress had taken the earliest opportunity of informing this Court of the declaration of 
their Independency, and that the variety of important affairs 
before Congress, with the critical situation of the armies in 
their neighborhood, and the obstructions of their commerce, 
had prevented that intelligence which had been wished for, 
but that the present served to shew the early and principal 
attention of the United States to this Court; and as their 
Independency was now in form declared, the queries I had 
formerly put in consequence of my first instructions might 
now be resolved, and I hoped favorably. To this I was 
answered, unless France by a public acknowledgment 
of your Independency makes war on Great Britain in 
your favor, what service can such acknowledgment be of 
to the United States? You are known here, our ports are 
open, and free for your commerce, and your ships are 
protected in them, and greater indulgencies allowed than to 
any other nations. If France should be obliged to make 
war on England, it will be much more just and honorable in 
the eyes of the world to make it on some other account ; 
and if made at all, it is the same thing to the United States 
of America, and in one important view better for them, to 
have it originate from any other cause, as America will be 
under the less immediate obligation. Further, France has 
alliances, and cannot resolve a question which must perhaps 
involve her in a war, without previously consulting them. 
Meantime the United States can receive the same succors 
and assistance from France without, as well as with, such 
an open acknowledgment, and perhaps much more advantageously. To this and such like arguments I had the less 
to reply, as you informed me that articles for a proposed 
alliance with France were under consideration, and that 
1 might soon expect them. 
</p><p>
I was further told that the Swiss Cantons, though in every 
respect free and independent States for several centuries, had not to this hour been acknowledged as such by 
any public act of any one power in Europe, except France, 
and that neither the Revolution in the United Provinces or 
Portugal had been attended with any such acknowledgement, though the powers of Europe in both cases lent 
their aid. I replied that I would not urge a formal 
acknowledgment, as long as the same ends could be 
obtained, and without the inconveniences hinted at ; besides, as I daily expected further instructions I would 
reserve myself until their arrival. The apprehensions of 
the United States' negociating has done us much damage, 
and the interview at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> said to have been between a Commissioner of Congress and the two brothers, 
however politic the step may have been in America, was 
made use of to our prejudice in Europe, at this Court in particular, as it has been for some time asserted by Lord Stormont and others, that a negotiation  would take place, and as 
far as this is believed, so far our cause has suffered and our 
friends been staggered in their resolutions. My opinion is, 
that the House of Bourbon in every branch will be our 
friends ', it is their interest to humble Great Britain. 
</p><p>
Yesterday it was roundly affirmed at Versailles, that a letter was received in London from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, in which it 
was said I had written advising the Congress to negociate, for 
that I could obtain no assistance from Europe. You can 
hardly conceive how dangerous even such reports are, and 
how prejudicial every step that looks like confirming them. 
The importance of America in every point of view, appears more and more striking to all Europe, but particularly to this kingdom. 
</p><p>
Enclosed I send you the size of masts and spars with the 
price, which, if it will answer, may be a certain article of remittance, as may other naval stores, but I dare not contract 
with the marine, as I have no powers, and am unacquainted 
with the rate at which they were usually exported to England. 
A wide field is opening, since the American commerce is to 
be free, and I have had applications from many parts on the 
subject, though few are disposed to venture until the close of 
this campaign, and if it is not decisive against us, our wants 
will be supplied another season at as cheap a rate as ever, 
but I trust never more on the old terms of Ion? credit. 
</p><p>
I am well nigh harrassed to death with applications 
of officers to go out to America. Those I have engaged 
are I trust in general of the best character ; but that I 
should engage, or rather take from the hands of some 
leading men here, some one or two among the rest not 
so accomplished, cannot be surprising, and may, considering my situation, be pardonable, but I have no suspicion of 
any such in my department, of consequence. I have been 
ofFered troops from Germany on the following general terms, 
viz; â€” officers to recruit as for the service of France, and embark for St Domingo from Dunkirk, and by altering their 
route land in the American States. The same has been proposed with Switzerland, to which I could give no encouragement, but submit it to your consideration in Congress, 
whether, if you can establish a credit as I have before hinted, 
it would not be well to purchase at Leghorn five or six stout 
frigates, which might at once transport some companies of 
Swiss, and a quantity of stores, and the whole be defended 
by the Swiss soldiers on their passage 9 Or, if you prefer Germans, which I really do not, the vessels might go from 
Dunkirk. I daily expect important advices from the North, 
respecting commerce at least, having sent to the King of 
Prussia, in consequence of a memorial he ordered his 
agent here to show me, and propose some queries to me, 
a state of the North American commerce at large. I have 
presented memorial after memorial here, until in my last I 
think I have exhausted the subject as far as the present 
time, having in my last given the history of the controversy, 
obviated the objections made against us, and pointed out the 
consequences that must ensue to France and Spain if they 
permit the Colonies to be subjugated by their old hereditary 
enemy. It consisted of fifty pages, and was, after being 
translated, presented to his Majesty and his Ministers, and 
I was assured was favorably received and considered. I 
presented it about two weeks since, and whether it has hastened the preparations or not I cannot say. The Ministry 
were pleased to say, that I had placed the whole in the most 
striking point of view, and they believed with great justice. 
I could wish to send you copies of these, but I have no assistant except occasionally, and the uncertainty of my situation will not permit my making engagements to one, who 
might deserve confidence, and those who are deserving are but few. 
</p><p>
Bread will be scarce before the next harvest. Flour is 
now 22 and 23 livres per cwt. and tobacco is as I have before mentioned ; and I promise myself you will not let slip 
so favorable an opportunity of making remittances to advantage. In expectation of your sending over frigates to 
convoy your ships, and of your giving instructions on what I have written you of operations in these seas, I design 
being at Bordeaux in March, when I shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair ; but, at any 
rate, send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in Europe under your flag. The prizes 
must finally be brought to you for condemnation, and the principal advantage will remain with you. I have written largely, and on many subjects, yet fear I have omitted some things deserving attention. 
</p><p>
Mons. du Coudray will be with you by the receipt of this, with stores complete for thirty thousand men. The 
extraordinary exertions of this gentleman, and his character, entide him to much from the United States, and I hope the 
sum I have stipulated with him for, will not be considered extravagant, when you consider it is much less than is given 
in Europe. Baron de Kalb I consider an important acquisition, as are many other of the officers whose characters I 
may not stay to particularize, but refer you to Baron de Kalb, who speaks English, and to Mr Rogers, who is generally acquainted with them. As to sea officers, they are 
not so easily obtained, yet some good ones may be had, and in particular two ; one of whom I have already mentioned ; 
the other is quite his equal, with some other advantages ; ho was first lieutenant of a man of war round the world, with 
Captain Cook, and has since had a ship, but wants to leave this for other service, where he may make a settlement, and 
establish a family. These two officers would engage a 
number of younger ones. Should they embark, I send herewith the plans of one of them for burning ships. I 
submit it to the honorable Congress, who are sensible of 
the variety and magnitude of the objects before me, whether it is not of importance to despatch some one of its body 
to assist me, or to take a part by his own immediate direction. Such a person known to possess your fullest confidence, would, by his advice and assistance, be of service 
to me, though he were, and I were, occasionally at Madrid or Berlin. Having obtained some knowledge of the language, 
and an acquaintance with those in power here, as well as others, such abilities as I have, which are ever devoted to 
my country, can be employed here to the best advantage at present, but I submit my thoughts to your determination, 
and am, with great truth and sincerity,
