Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Your Declaration of the fourth of July last has given this Court, as well as several others in Europe, reason to expect 
you would in form announce your Independency to them, and ask their friendship ; but a three months' silence on that 
subject appears to them mysterious, and the more so as you declared for foreign alliances. This silence has again given me 
the most inexpressible anxiety, and has more than once come near frustrating my whole endeavors ; on which subject I 
refer you to mine of the first instant. Employment must be found for the forces of Great Britain out of the United States 
of North America. The Caribs in St Vincent, if set agoing, 
may be supplied through Martinique with stores. The Mountain negroes in Jamaica may employ a great number of their 
forces. This is not employing slaves, which, however, the 
example of our enemy authorises. Should there arise troubles in these two Islands, which a very little money would effect, the consequence would be, that Great Britain, which can 
by no means think of giving them up, would be so far from being able to increase her force on the continent, that she 
must withdraw a large part to defend her Islands. I find that every one here, who is acquainted with Bermuda, is in my 
sentiments ; and by the officiousness of H. the ministry here have got it by the end. This makes me the more solicitous, 
that the Island should be fortified this winter if practicable. 
Tobacco in Holland is at the enormous price of seven stivers, and will soon be as dear in France and Germany. 
I have promised that you will send out twenty thousand hogsheads this winter, in payment for the articles wanted 
here. Let me advise you to ship the whole to Bordeaux, after which it may be shipped in French bottoms to any 
other port ; the price will pay the convoy ; therefore I would 
recommend the vessels in which it should be shipped to be 
armed, and that each ship shall sail under convoy of one of 
your frigates, which may also be ballasted with it ; this will 
be safer than coming in a fleet. On their arrival, Messrs Delap, whose zeal and fidelity in our service are great, will 
be directed by me, or in my absence by Mons. B. or 
ostensibly by Messrs Hortalez and Co. where to apply the 
money. Eight or ten of your frigates, thus collected at 
Bordeaux, with a proper number of riflemen as marines, 
where they might have leisure to refit and procure supplies, 
would strike early next season a terrible blow to the British 
commerce in Europe, and obtain noble indemnity. The 
appearance of American cruisers in those seas has amazed 
the British merchants, and insurance will now be on the war 
establishment ; this will give the rival nations a great superiority in commerce, of which they cannot be insensible ; and as 
our vessels of war will be protected in the ports of France 
and Spain, the whole of the British commerce will be exposed. I hope to have a liberty for the disposal of prizes here, 
but dare not engage for that. The last season the whole 
coast of England, Scotland, and Ireland has been and still 
remains unguarded ; three or four frigates, arriving as they 
certainly might unexpectedly, would be sufficient to pillage 
port Glasgow or other western towns. The very alarm, 
which this would occasion, might have the most surprising 
and important effects, and in this method it might be effected 
with the utmost certainty if entered upon early next spring ; 
but should that be laid aside, the having five or six more of 
your stoutest ships in these ports, where you may every day 
receive intelligence of what is about to sail from England, 
would put it in our power to make great reprisals.

I wrote for blank commissions, or a power to grant commissions to ships of war. Pray forward them, as here are 
many persons wishing for an opportunity of using them in 
this way. The granting commissions against Portugal would 
ensure the friendship of Spain. Grain will bear a great price 
in this kingdom and the south of Europe ; and I have made 
application to the minister of marine to supply masts and 
spars from America for the French navy. Pray inform me 
how, and on what terms the British navy formerly used to be 
supplyed from New England. I am fully of opinion, that a 
war must break out soon and become general in Europe. 
I need say no more on the situation I am in, for want of your 
further instructions. I live in hopes, but should I be much 
longer disappointed, the affairs I am upon, as well as my 
credit, must suffer, if not be absolutely ruined. My most 
respectful compliments to the Congress.

I am, gentlemen,

Your most obedient very humble servant,
