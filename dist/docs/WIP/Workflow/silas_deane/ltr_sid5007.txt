Sir, 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mons. M. Martin de la Balme, has long served with reputation in the armies of France as a Captain of 
Cavalry, and is now advanced to the rank of a Lt Colonel ; he has made military discipline his study, and has written 
on the subject to good acceptance ; he now generously offers his services to the United States of North America, 
and asks of me what I most cheerfully grant, a letter to you and his passage, confident he may be of very great service, 
if not in the general army, yet in those Colonies which are raising and disciplining cavalry. I have only to add that he 
is in good esteem here, and is well recommended, to which I am persuaded he will do justice. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, etc.
