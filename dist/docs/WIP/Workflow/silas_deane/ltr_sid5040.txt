Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the 7th instant, in which you informed me, that mine of the same date to you was by 
Congress ordered to lie on the table, until the examination of Mr Carmichael should be finished. 
</p><p>
Though totally unable even to conjecture, what relation the 
examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters, written by Mr Izard and Mr Lee, yet, 
as I had so often troubled Congress during a three months' attendance, with my repeated solicitations to be heard, I 
forbore repealing them until neither my health, my interest, 
nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in America; I have, therefore, taken the liberty of enclosing my 
answers to the letters of those gentlemen. It pains me to be obliged to answer at all, and it grieves me exceedingly to be 
deprived of the opportunity of doing it in person ; I still hope to be indulged before leaving America. I have only further 
to inform Congress, that I shall go into the country tomorrow, for a few days, that having engaged a passage in a ship, 
which will sail for France sometime next month, I propose to leave <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in a few days after I return from 
the country, in order to embark, and shall esteem myself honored by Congress if they have any thing further in 
which I may be of service to my country, if they will favor me with their commands. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to remain, etc. 
</p><p>
