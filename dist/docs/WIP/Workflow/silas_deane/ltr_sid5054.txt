Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor of writing to you on the 22d of February past, to which letter I beg leave to refer your 
Excellency. Having received no answer to the requests I then made, I have now only to add, that my situation, which 
for eight months past has been peculiarly distressing, is now become such as to oblige me to leave this city without further delay, and therefore I again most respectfully entreat 
of Congress to inform me, if they expect further information from me respecting their foreign or other affairs, and as I 
shall without loss of time, return to Europe, that I may be informed if they have any further commands for my service, 
and in what manner my past transactions, as their agent and commissioner, are to be adjusted and closed. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, etc. 
</p><p>
