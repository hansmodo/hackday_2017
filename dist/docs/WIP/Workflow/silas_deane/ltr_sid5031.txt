Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
This will be handed you by M. Francy, who is agent for Messrs Rodrique Hortalez & Co. You will see by the 
bills of lading, the quantity of stores shipped by that house, and make some judgment of there considerable amount. The vessel, in which Mr. Francy sails, is loaded with 
stores, which were long since engaged, but by a succession 
of obstacles have been until this detained. I still hope they 
will arrive in safety, and in season to be of service. The 
ship will be offered you to purchase, if she suits you, and if 
not, it will be equally agreeable to have her returned on 
the owners' account. I could not say any thing of purchasing a slijp, without knowing more of her than I could 
know of this ; I have therefore left it to your option to pay 
the price demanded, or the freight ; the latter is to be what 
is at this time customary in vessels of such force, which not 
being precisely fixed, is sulmiitted to M. Chaumont, by the 
advice and consent of my colleagues ; it will probably be 
about two hundred and fifty livres per ton of goods to 
America, and back to France j it will not exceed that. 
</p><p>
Messrs Rodrique Hortalez h Co. have other vessels, 
which will follow this in a short time, which they want to 
have despatched with tobacco, agreeably to what they formerly wrote you, and M. Francy goes partly on that 
account ; I must therefore pray you to furnish him with the 
means of procuring the quantity he will want for them in 
season. The cargo of the Therese, sent by the way of St 
Domingo, I hope is by this time arrived ; it was so valuable 
that it was thought most prudent to send it by that route, as 
it would run no risk in getting there, whence it might in 
different bottoms be got into the Continent, without the considerable risk of going direct. As the vessels of Messrs Hortalez h Co. will arrive at a time when despatch will be 
of the utmost consequence, they are desirous to have their 
cargoes ready on their arrival. By these vessels I will 
write you particularly on this subject, and in the meantime, 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, &tc.
