Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since receiving yours of the 4th and 5th of August last, 
I have written you repeatedly, and have no doubt of your 
receipt of my letters, to which I refer you. You are in the 
neighborhood of St Vincents, and I learn that die Caribs 
are not contented with their masters, and being an artful as 
well as revengeful people, would undoubtedly take this opportunity of throwing off a yoke, which nothing but a superior force can keep on them. My request is, that you would 
inquire into the state of that island, by proper emissaries, and if the Caribs are disposed to revolt, encourage them and 
promise them aid of arms and ammunition. This must tear 
from Great Britain an island, which they value next to Jamaica, and to which indeed they have no title but what rests 
on violence and cruelty. At any rate they will oblige Great Britain to withdraw part of her forces from the continent. 
If any thing can be effected there, inform me instantly, and I will order to your care such a quantity of stores as you shall, think necessary. 
</p><p>
The enclosed letter I desire you to break the seal of, and make as many copies as there are vessels going northward, 
by which some one must arrive. A war I think may be depended upon, but keep your intelligence of every kind 
secret, save to those of the Secret Committee. 
</p><p>
You will send also a copy of this, by which the Committee will see the request I have made to you, and the 
reason of their receiving several duplicates in your handwriting. I wish you to forward the enclosed to Mr Tucker, 
of Bermuda, and write me by every vessel to Bordeaux or 
</p><p>
Nantes. 
</p><p>
I am, with great esteem, &,c.
