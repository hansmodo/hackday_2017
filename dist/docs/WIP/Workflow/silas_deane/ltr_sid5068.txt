Sir, 
</p><p>
On my arriving in France, I applied to Mr Johnson to appoint a time for examining my accounts and vouchers, 
which I told him would soon be ready. He informed me, that he had determined not to accept the appointment, and 
that he had informed Congress of his resolution sometime before. Though this was a severe disappointment to me, 
yet I flattered myself that Congress would not delay the naming some other to the office, and in this hope I came to 
Paris in August last, and entered on the adjustment of my accounts, which have been for many months ready for settlement, yet, to my extreme mortification, I cannot get them closed for want of an auditor, or person empowered by Congress to examine them. 
</p><p>
I pray Congress would candidly review the circumstances I have been under, from my leaving France in 
April, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, to this time. After having to that time faithfully and successfully served them, I was, in obedience 
to their orders, obliged to make a voyage to America, and to wait their pleasure in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> for more than a year, 
unable to obtain their decision on my conduct, though it was almost daily solicited by me ; the only objection made 
was, that my accounts remained unsettled ; as soon as Congress appointed an auditor to examine them, I set out on 
my voyage to Europe, regardless of danger or expense, fondly hoping that at last I should be able to close my 
accounts, and to receive the balance due to me, but what 
was infinitely more important, to vindicate my injured character. The expenses of my voyage were great, and during 
ten months' attendance here, they have been still greater, and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor, 
I have been refused money for my support. I have never 
asked of Congress anything but common justice, in the payment of my just demands, out of which, I have now been 
kept for three years. My necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the 
amount of the money due to me, but I have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my 
country, and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support. And to what purpose is it for 
me to leave France, and return with my accounts and vouchers unaudited. It is equally useless to transmit 
them in that state. My enemies represented me as a defaulter, grown rich out of the public monies in my hands, 
and prejudiced the minds of Congress so strongly against me, that all my efforts in America to obtain even a hearing 
were vain and ineffectual. My present situation, as well as the state of my accounts, give the lie to every assertion 
or insinuation of the kind, yet T am still left to suffer under the calumny in America, and to be obliged to strangers for 
money for my support in Europe. I will not trust myself further on the subject, lest something escape me which may 
offend, without my intending it. 
</p><p>
I hope Congress will impartially review my case in every 
stage of it, and that they will not force me to appeal to the laws of a foreign nation, or to the tribunal of the public in 
Europe, for the recovery of my right, and for justice to my character, which the great and first law of nature will oblige 
me to do, unless immediately relieved by those who owe me, and more who owe to their own character, and to that 
of their country, the justice which I demand. I have the honor to be. 
</p><p>
With great esteem and respect, &c.
