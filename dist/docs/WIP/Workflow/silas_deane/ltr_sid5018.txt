Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I have recommended several officers to your service, but none with greater pleasure, scarce any one with so much 
confidence of his answering great and valuable purposes, as the bearer, Colonel Conway, a native of Ireland, advanced 
in the service by his merit. His views are to establish himself and his growing family in America ; consequently he 
becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles. This gentleman has seen much service; his 
principal department has been that of training and disciplining troops, and preparing for action ; and from his abilities as well 
as from his long experience, he is considered as one of the most skilful disciplinarians in France. Such an officer must be, I conceive, of very great service, and his generously confiding in the honorable Congress for such rank and 
appointments as they shall confer, entitles him still more to our immediate attention and notice. I have assured him 
of the most favorable reception, and am confident he will receive the same. 
</p><p>
Colonel Conway takes with him some young officers of his own training, who know well the English language, and may 
be of immediate service in the same important department of discipline. As Colonel Conway has been long in service, 
(though in prime of life) I am confident you will not think it right he should rank under those who have served under him 
in this kingdom, which will not be the case if he fills the place 
of an Adjutant, or Brigadier General, for which, I am well assured, he is every way well qualified. I have advanced him 
as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages, and told him he may rely on your granting 
him one of the above ranks in the Continental forces. Should the honorable Congress have a new body of troops 
to form in any part of the Continent, this gentleman might take the direction of them to very great advantage, and may, 
I presume, be equally so in the station you may appoint him ill the main army. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &;c.
