Sir, 
</p><p>
When I had the honor of waiting on Congress last, I was informed that I should be favored with an opportunity of finishing my narrative without delay. I now take the 
liberty of applying to Congress, and to inform them that I am ready, and wait their orders. I have received letters, which I am desirous to communicate personally; they 
relate to parts of my narrative. My solicitude for a final issue of my affairs will, I trust, not appear unreasonable to Congress, when it is considered that a certain Mr Thomas Paine, styling himself Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and presuming to address the public in his official character, 
has thrown out in a late paper many insinuations injurious to my public character, and has avowed his intentions of laying before die public a number of interesting facts, and 
materials, relative to my conduct, as one of the commissioners of these United States at the Court of France. 
</p><p>
I rely on the justice of Congress, and have the honor to be, etc. 
</p><p>
