Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received the letter, which you did me the honor 
to write me on the third, with the accompanying copies of the 
decrees. The reparation enjoined by the representatives of 
the French nation is worthy of its justice, and consequently 
the United States will be perfectly satisfied with it. 
</p><p>
They will also discover, Sir, in that which exempts their 
vessels from the dispositions of the decree of May ninth, a 
new proof of the fidelity of the French in fulfilling their engagements. I shall give them an account, at the same time, of 
the instructions which you have the goodness to send to citizen Genet. I beg you, Sir, to accept the assurances of my 
gratitude for the promptness with which you have attended 
to this business. ;&gt; ...
