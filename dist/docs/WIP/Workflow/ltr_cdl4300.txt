Sir, 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> has delivered to me 
the letters of your Excellency, and I am extremely 
flattered by this mark of your attention and of your 
remembrance. I have executed your commissions near 
his Majesty and the Royal Family, and the King is 
concerned that your domestic affairs deprive him of 
the satisfaction to see a man, whose talents and virtues have procured the happiness of his country, and 
excited the admiration of all others. 
</p><p>
I thank you heartily for the news your Excellency has been pleased to give me of America. The 
present excellent formation of Congress gives me 
great hopes that the public debt will be secured, 
and that all the other branches of administration will 
take a more regular form. A nation, which has done 
so great things as yours, during ten years, is expected to crown its achievements by acts of justice. 
This qualification is so common in America, that I am 
persuaded its voice will be heard in all your assemblies, and America will be at last as just in time of 
peace, as it has been patient and brave during the war.

Since my arrival in Europe, the different Cabinets 
have been much agitated. The Emperor has produced 
some pretensions against Holland, which are not yet 
adjusted. He has likewise manifested a desire to 
annex the Duchy of Bavaria to his dominions, and to 
cede, by way of exchange, to the Elector the Austrian possessions in the Netherlands. This arrangement seems to displease very much the different military powers in Europe. Preparations of war are going on at Vienna, at Berlin, in Holland, and in 
France. It is, however, very probable that the war 
will not take place in the course of this year. But 
a general flame is certainly very near to break out; 
and though France and England be very far from 
wishing for war, it will be very difficult to prevent 
the troubles of Germany, if the Emperor does not, 
of his own accord, give up his pretensions. The Imperial Court seems to be intimately united with that 
of Russia ; two powers, rich in resources, and full of 
ambition ; and as they are not happy enough to 
have, like America, at their head a man who prefers 
the welfare of mankind to his private advantage, 
there are great apprehensions of a general war in 
Europe. The events of it will be read by your Excellency, in your retreat, with a small degree of satisfaction; for you will observe that, far from giving 
liberty to some nation, this war will only serve to 
increase the miseries of several countries during many years. 
</p><p>
I am very thankful for the interest you are pleased to take in my fate, which is not yet decided. If 
I was allowed to follow my own inclination, I should 
wish to return to America, and to be happy with my 
old friends ; but a consequence of my profession is to 
accept of the destination which is prescribed to me. 
Whatever it may be, I shall never forget the attention and friendship of your Excellency. I beg you 
to continue in those sentiments, and to honor me 
sometimes with your letters. With the most sincere 
and respectful attachment and acknowledgment, I 
have the honor to be. Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and very humble servant,
