SIR: 
</p><p>
On receipt of this immediately march, with twenty-five men of your 
company, to Ninety-Six, and join <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Col. Williams</a>, in order to guard the 
prisoners while on trial. You will receive orders from <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Col. Williams</a> 
when you arrive at Ninety-Six. Binborough is to supply you with pro 
visions while on duty. You will have Lieut. Joseph Wardlaw and 
any others of your company that were prisoners with the Tories, and 
can be any evidence against any of them. Elijah and Samuel Moore, 
that were with me at the battle of Kettle Creek, I am well informed 
have some horses and two rifle guns that were taken at that battle, and 
as that property belongs to the people in general, you will order them, 
without loss of time, to bring those effects to me, or they may depend 
on being prosecuted for the same. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your humble servant, 
</p><p>
