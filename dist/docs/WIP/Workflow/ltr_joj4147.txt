My Lord, 
</p><p>
A long interval has passed between the date of my last 
letter and that of this. They would have been more 
frequent, had they been exposed to less risk of interception. 
</p><p>
My respect and esteem for your lordship remain unabated, 
and I yet flatter myself with the pleasure of becoming a 
better correspondent. It will give you satisfaction to know 
that the letters I have received from <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a> and Mr. Gore, make honourable mention of the candour and good 
faith of your government. They both appear to be well 
pleased, and I am glad of it. The proceedings of the 
Congress now in session will doubtless be sent to you. 
There appears to be a general disposition to pacific measures throughout our country. If it procures peace, so 
much the better ; if not, we shall be the more united. To 
put our adversaries in the wrong is always a valuable point 
gained, especially as the forbearance necessary for the purpose will not in the present instance be prompted by fear, 
nor produce dejection. 
</p><p>
In every event, some malcontents are to be expected ; 
and it is remarkable that patriots born in British dominions, 
are very distinguishable among those who the most invariably oppose our government and its measures. They 
appear to be as little disposed to promote good-will between 
our two countries, as the French ; indeed, they seem to like 
</p><p>
our government as little as they did their own. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with very great respect, esteem, 
</p><p>
and regard, 
</p><p>
My lord, 
</p><p>
Your lordship's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
