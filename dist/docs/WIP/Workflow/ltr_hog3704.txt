Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> has, in his letter of yesterday, acquainted me that it is your Excellency's desire to 
know if I wish to take command in the army this campaign. I beg your Excellency to believe, that I 
am always ready to obey your commands, and shall 
be most happy when I can execute them to your 
satisfaction. I have but to entreat, that no attention 
to me, or my rank, may interfere, or break in upon 
any part of your Excellency's arrangements. My 
zeal for the public interest makes me exceedingly 
anxious to be present at the great concluding stroke 
of this war. 
</p><p>
I intend to proceed immediately to Berkley, and 
prepare myself for taking the field. I brought nothing with me here ; neither did I settle my domestic matters before I left home. This will ' take up 
but a few days ; when finished, I shall hold myself 
constantly ready to obey your orders. I earnestly 
request your Excellency will be assured of my inviolable attachment, and that no time or circumstance 
shall ever shake that resolution. In consequence of 
my application to Congress upon my arrival here, 1 
have received the inclosed resolve, in a very affectionate letter from my worthy friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>. With sentiments of the greatest esteem and 
respect, I am, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most faithful, humble servant, 
</p><p>
