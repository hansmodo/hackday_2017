DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Favour by Mr. Jefferies. I should have 
been glad if in any thing I could have served him here. The 
Part I took in the Application for your Degree l was merely 
doing justice to Merit, which is the Duty of an honest Man 
whenever he has the Opportunity. I did that Duty, indeed, 
with Pleasure and Satisfaction to myself, which was sufficient ; 
but I own the Pleasure is greatly increased by finding, that 
you are so good as to accept my Endeavours kindly. 
</p><p>
I was about to return home last Summer, and had some thoughts of doing it by way of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>; but the untoward 
Situation of American Affairs here induc'd my Friends to 
advise my staying another Winter. I should have been happy 
in doing any Service to our Country. The Tide is yet strong 
against us, and our Endeavours to turn it have hitherto had 
but little Effect. But it must turn, if your frugal and industrious Resolutions continue. Your old Governor, Mr. Pownall, 
appears a warm and zealous Friend to the Colonies in Parliament, but unfortunately he is very ill-heard at present. 
I have been in constant Pain since I heard of Troops assembling at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, lest the Madness of Mobs, or the Insolence 
of Soldiers, or both, should, when too near each other, occasion some Mischief difficult to be prevented or repaired, and 
which might spread far and wide. I hope, however, that 
Prudence will predominate, and keep all quiet. 
</p><p>
A great cause between the City of London and the Dissenters was decided here the Year before last in the House of 
Lords. No Account of it has been printed ; but, one having 
been taken in writing, I obtained a Copy of it, which I send 
you, supposing it may afford you and your Friends some 
Pleasure. 
</p><p>
Please to present my respectful Compliments to Mrs. 
Cooper, and to <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a>, when you see him. With 
sincere and great esteem, I am, Rev'd dear Sir 
</p><p>
Your affectionate & most obedient humble servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
