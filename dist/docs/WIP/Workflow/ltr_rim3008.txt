<p rel="heading">
I do hereby certify, that the above articles were presented to 
me, to which I have given the following answer ; 
</p><p>
The city of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, having neither ammunition, artillery, 
troops, nor provisions, and having it not in their power to fulfil 
one article of the treaty, can claim no title to a capitulation. 
</p><p>
The Continental army have a generous disdain of every act of 
oppression and violence; they are come for the express purpose 
of giving liberty and security. The General, therefore, engages 
his honor to maintain, in the peaceable enjoyment of their property of every kind, the individuals and religious communities of 
the city of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants, whether English, French, or others, shall be 
maintained in the free exercise of their religion. 
</p><p>
The present unhappy contention between Great Britain and 
her Colonies puts it out of his power to engage for freedom of 
trade to the mother country; nor can he make a general promise of passports; as far as it may consist with the safety of 
the troops and the public good, he shall be happy to promote 
commerce, and, for that purpose, promises to grant passports for 
the upper countries, when required. 
</p><p>
The General hopes to see such a virtuous Provincial Convention assembled, as will enter with zeal into every measure that 
can contribute to set the civil and religious rights of this and her 
sister Colonies on a permanent foundation. He promises for him 
self, that he will not compel the inhabitants of the town to take 
up arms against the Mother Country, or contribute towards the 
expenses of carrying on the present war. 
</p><p>
The Continental army came into this province for its protection ; they, therefore, cannot consider their opposers as taking up 
arms for its defence. 
</p><p>
It is not in the General's power to engage for the return of 
prisoners ; motives of humanity will induce him to use his interest for their return to their families, provided it can be done 
without endangering the public safety. 
</p><p>
Speedy measures shall be taken for the establishing Courts 
of Justice upon the most liberal plan conformable to the British 
Constitution. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants shall not be burdened with troops but when necessity requires it; of which necessity the General must be judge. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants of the country, and savages, shall not enter 
the town till the guards are posted. 
</p><p>
To-morrow morning, at nine o clock, the Continental troops 
shall take possession of the Recollect Gate. The proper officers 
must attend, with the keys of all public stores, upon the Quartermaster-General at nine o clock at the Recollect Gate. 
</p><p>
This engagement is understood and declared to be binding on 
any future commanding officer of the Continental troops, that 
may succeed me in this district. 
</p><p>
RICHARD MONTGOMERY, 
Brigadier- General Continental Army.
