DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am concerned to understand lately that you have never 
been paid as I expected for the Ephemerides, and therefore 
I send you three Guineas by our valuable Friend M. Baudeau, 
requesting you will let me have the Accompt at your Leisure, 
& I will take care for the future that the Payment shall be 
more punctual. You are doing a great deal of Good to 
Mankind, for which I am afraid you are not duly rewarded, 
except in the Satisfaction that results from it to your benevolent Mind. With sincere and great Esteem and Affection, 
I have the Honour to be, 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient 
</p><p>
& most humble servant, 
</p><p>
(Signed) B. FRANKLIN.
