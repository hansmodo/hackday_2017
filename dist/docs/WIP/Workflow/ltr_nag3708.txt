Sir, 
</p><p>
I am happy in the opportunity of answering your 
Excellency, that I am received and treated with all 
the marks of respect and attention that I can wish. 
Your letters have been of singular service ; and I am 
exceedingly obliged to you for the warm manner in 
which you recommended me to the notice of your 
friends ; among whom, Mr. Carey has been very polite and obliging. 
</p><p>
Your weight and influence, both with Congress and 
this State, in support of the southern operations, will 
be exceedingly important and necessary to my success. 
I must request, therefore, in the most earnest manner, 
that your Excellency continue to animate both those 
bodies, with your opinion and recommendations, to 
such measures, and such exertions, as will be necessary to give due support to the Southern army, 
without which, I am very apprehensive, the languor 
that is too apt to seize all public bodies will lull 
them into a state of false security, and the affairs in 
the Southern department will and must go to ruin. 
It has been my opinion for a long time; that personal influence must supply The defects of civil constitution; 
but I have never been so fully convinced of it as on 
this journey. I believe the vievss and wishes of the 
great body of the people are entirely with us. But 
remove the personal influence of a few, and they are a 
lifeless and inanimate mass, without direction, or spirit 
to employ the means they possess, for their own security. 
</p><p>
I cannnot contemplate my own situation without 
the greatest degree of anxiety. I am far removed 
from almost all my friends and connections, and have 
to prosecute a war in a country, in the best state 
attended with almost insurmountable difficulties, but 
doubly so now, from the state of our finances and 
the loss of public credit. How I shall be able to 
support myself, under all these embarrassments, God 
only knows ! My only consolation is, that if I fail, I 
hope it will not be accompanied with an}'- peculiar 
marks of personal disgrace. Censure and reproach ever 
follow the unfortunate. This I expect, if I don't succeed ; and it is only in the degree, not in the entire 
freedom, that I console myself The ruin of my family is what hangs most heavy upon my mind. My 
fortune is small, and misfortune or disgrace to me 
must be ruin to them. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency will do me the honor to 
forward the inclosed letter to Mrs. Greene, by the 
first safe conveyance, who is rendered exceedingly 
unhappy at my going to the southward. 
</p><p>
Mr. Custis arrived in town yesterday, and says 
Mrs. Washington is to set out for the army this day. 
I have the honor to be, &c.,

P. S. Colonel Scammell, perhaps, will be promoted 
to the rank of Brigadier ; at least, it has been talked 
of. Should this take place, a new Adjutant-General will be necessary J and I beg leave to suggest the 
propriety of giving this appointment to <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Hamilton</a>. His services may not be less important to 
your Excellency in your family business, if he only 
employs a deputy extraordinary ; and I am persuaded 
the appointment will be received with great gratitude, 
as I am confident it is his wish, by what he said to 
me before I left camp.
