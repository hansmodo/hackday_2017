Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your Excellency's despatches of the 18th of December and 29th of January. I am made happy by your full approbation 
of my conduct, and the army under my command, 
during the southern operations. The evacuation of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and the proposals of peace, are matters 
highly interesting to this country, whose finances and 
political arrangements are in the most deplorable situation. <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> remains without a platform, or a 
single cannon for its defence. The subsistence of the 
troops, for some time after the evacuation of this 
place, depended on military collections ; but, happily, 
we have made a contract for their future subsistence. 
On this subject I should feel easy, but for the critical situation the Financier writes me his department 
is circumstanced. 
</p><p>
The States have rejected the five per cent, duty 
act generally, and few pay any thing into the Continental Treasury any other -way. I wrote a letter to 
this State on the subject a few days past, stating 
some facts respecting the discontents prevailing in 
the Northern army respecting pay, and what might 
be expected in this to the southward. I thought it 
my duty to warn the State of what I apprehended. 
The impost act was rejected, notwithstanding, and 
the Assembly offended. I will ever speak my sentiments, and act with candor. I wish to know the nature and extent of the discontent ]3revailing in the 
northern troops. Matters are represented here in 
dark colors. The report spreads among our troops, 
and threatens a convulsion. I shall give you the 
best information on the subject in my power ; but 
these things often come to a crisis from accident and 
indiscretion, before one expects it. I could wish to 
be fully informed respecting the temper of the Northern army ; it would enable me to counteract many 
aggravations here. 
</p><p>
I have communicated to the Assembly your orders 
for marching the troops to the northward ; but I am 
much at a loss how to act in the matter. Your Excellency seems to leave a latitude of discretion respecting the tranquillity of these States ; but your 
comment upon a desultory and predatory war, appears 
to be intended to limit m}' discretionary powers to 
matters of serious invasion. We have none at present, 
and yet there are parties continually making inroads 
upon different sides of both Georgia and South Carolina, from St. Augustine. 
</p><p>
If I put the troops in motion, as you mention, it 
leaves the Southern States a prey to every invader. 
A small force, in their present distracted state, would 
overrun the country, and <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> may be repossessed, at any time, by a few frigates, with a regiment or two of inftmtiy. I would wish to follow 
your intention. If I could conceive you had a clear 
idea of the weakness and distress of this country, the 
troops should march immediately ; hut the prospects 
of peace, and the possibility of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> being evacuated, if the war should continue, induce me to 
wait until the arrival of the next despatches. In the 
mean time, I shall have every preparation made for 
their marching as soon as may be. The men are 
well clothed, and pretty well disciplined. Some few 
days before the arrival of your last letter, from an 
appearance of an invasion upon Georgia, I put the 
Virginia troops in motion for the protection of that 
quarter ; and, as their numbers are small, and will be 
of little consequence in the siege, I shall not march 
them until your further orders. 
</p><p>
The people of this State are much prejudiced 
against Congress and the Financier. Those who came 
from the northward think they have been amazingly 
neglected by both in their distresses. Their General disposition leads more to an independence of Congressional connection, than I could wish, or is for 
their peace or welfare. This State has contributed 
more than any other State, it is true, towards the 
Continental expenses; but necessity obliged them. I 
wish all the States could see how much the tranquillity of each depended upon giving effectual support 
to Congress. I have the honor to be, with great 
respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
