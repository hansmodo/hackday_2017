SIR, 
</p><p>
I received the resolves of the Congress, of the 8th of January, 
with an astonishment that no occurrence ever before occasioned. 
It would be misplaced to enter now into any reasoning upon the 
subject. 
</p><p>
I apply to you, Sir, as an individual whom I believe to have 
honor, humanity, and generosity. My Aid-de-camp has directions 
to communicate to you my letters to the Congress. I leave to 
your feelings to support that which regards my private situation, 
only begging leave to recall to your recollection the offer you 
made, in regard to my personal embarkation. In the full persuasion of the integrity of that proposal, I thought not of entering 
into reasonings and justifications in my public or private letters 
from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, in any such degree as the delicacy of a soldier's 
character required, after a series of the most critical situations, 
difficult attempts, and diversified ill success. To die in this country, is nothing ; but to leave my honor unvindicated in my own, 
is more than philosophy or fortitude can be expected to bear. 
</p><p>
I confide in you, to consider this entirely as a private letter, 
and am, 
</p><p>
With sincere regard, Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
