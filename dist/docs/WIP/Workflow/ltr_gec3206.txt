DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Immediately after our late misfortune at Fort Montgomery, I 
wrote the Legislature of this State the particulars, requesting 
them, without delay, to forward them to you. My hurry, at that 
time, and since, prevented my answering your favor of the 4th 
instant until now ; since which, the enemy have taken possession 
of Fort Constitution, and are, at this time, riot far below the clievaux-dc-frise. 
My guards fell in with, and took two spies from General Clinton, going to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a>. One of them confessed, that his orders 
were to make all possible despatch, and inform <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> that he had got Fort Montgomery, the key of America, and that 
he was prepared to weigh the chevaux-de-frise ; and that he, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a>, might now proceed, as all obstacles in the river were re 
moved, lie further says, that Clinton is determined to push up 
the river to relieve Burgoyne from his present difficulty. The 
inclosed confession of Taylor will give you some idea of their 
past manoeuvres and future intentions. 
</p><p>
If I have been rightly informed, your army is now so numerous that you can with safety order a part of it to establish a 
post at, or this side, <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. In that case, if they move up, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, who is collecting a large body of the Connecticut militia on the opposite shore, will be able to join them. I 
shall endeavour to keep between them and your army, with two 
Continental regiments and some militia; and I hope, by this 
means, to keep them from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. Indeed, I am sure it can 
be done, provided you establish a post on this side for us to 
retire to. I cannot, at present, ascertain the number lost at Fort Montgomery. My brother, General Clinton, who received a wound 
in his thigh, with a number of other officers, and two hundred of 
Dubois's regiment, made their escape after the enemy were in 
possession of the fort, and have come in safe. 
</p><p>
"We have just received intelligence that General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> 
attacked the enemy, last Saturday, on Chestnut Hill, near <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, defeated, and drove them through Germantown. Night 
coming on, he withdrew, and renewed the attack early on Sunday 
morning, and had gained the victory.* We have as yet received 
no authenticated accounts of the action. 
</p><p>
Colonel Lamb, and most of his officers who were with me at 
the fort, also escaped. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
