Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The British ratification of the treaty not having 
arrived, and consequently the time for appointing the 
Commissioners mentioned in it not being come, I 
have thus long postponed replying to yours of the 
21st of last month. It certainly is important that 
the Commissioners relative to the debts, and also the 
captures, be men the best qualified for those places. 
Probably it would be advisable to appoint one lawyer 
and one merchant for each of them. The capture 
cases are to be decided in London. From much that 
I have heard, and the little I have observed of Mr. Higginson, of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I am induced to think him, as 
a merchant, the best qualified of any I am acquainted 
with ; and the mass of the captures being from the 
Eastern and Middle States, it perhaps would be most 
satisfactory that the Commissioners should be from 
those countries. With him I should be inclined to 
join <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>, or Mr. Dexter, or perhaps Mr. Smith, 
of South Carolina. 
</p><p>
For the debts, it seems to me best to take some 
sensible merchant, north of the Potomac, and particularly of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, if one of acknowledged weight 
and character could be found willing to serve. If not, 
I should think of Colonel Wads worth, or some other 
like him; and associate with him Judge Paterson, or 
Mr. Benson, or <a href='/results.php?tla=tom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Marshall</a>. 
</p><p>
I am really very much at a loss about Sir John Sinclair's plan. It pleases me, and I wish that our country would offer bounties for useful discoveries, 
wherever made. Perhaps no inconveniences could arise from recommending such a measure to Congress, in general terras, without having any reference to 
Great Britain. But even this, I think, had better be postponed until the treaty business shall have been despatched. With perfect esteem and attachment, I 
am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
John Jay.
