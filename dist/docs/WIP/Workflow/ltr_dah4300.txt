My dear General, 
</p><p>
I did not trouble you with a letter from <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, 
because our public despatch to the Secretary at War, 
would inform you of our proceedings to that time. 
Besides, the oppressive nature of the intolerable heat, 
and the exertion we were obliged to make to get 
forward on our journey, occasioned such a relaxation 
and consequent sickness, as rendered me almost incapable of writing. We are all now well. 
</p><p>
After a fatiguing journey through the deep sands which prevail from <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, we reached 
the latter on the evening of the 17th instant. We 
intended to remain there one day, to make arrangements with the Executive for the negotiation, and to 
take measures for forwarding our stores, which were 
expected at <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, by water, in a few days. But, 
upon receiving information from Messrs. <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='met colleague'>Pickens</a> and 
Osborne, that the Indians were growing very impatient to return to their homes, and that they could not 
possibly be detained but a few days longer, we recommenced our journey that evening. The next day, 
the iron axle-tree of our carriage broke, at a great 
distance from any house, which accident occasioned 
the loss of the whole day. Being determined to arrive at the Rock Landing the following evening, according to our last letter to Mr. McGillivray, <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a> and myself took two of the carriagehorses, wdth a guide, and proceeded twenty-five miles 
that night. Yesterday we reached this place at dark, 
after having travelled a long distance before we 
reached the Ogechee, and from the Ogechee to the 
Oconee (between thirty and forty miles), through a 
dreary wilderness, in which there was not a single 
house. Mr. Griffin, with ^Mr. Few and Colonel Franks, 
were to come on as soon as the carriage could be 
mended, for which arrangements were made before 
we left them. 
</p><p>
We announced our arrival, and readiness to proceed 
to business, to McGillivray, last night. He is about 
three miles on the other side of the Oconee, with all 
the Indians, and we have not yet seen him. It is 
but justice to say, that from every thing which we 
have yet learned, the former Commissioners have conducted themselves, with respect to the present negotiations, in a very commendable manner. The Executive have resolved to give his every aid and facility in 
the business. We have not been here long enough to 
be assured of the prospects of success, or to know the 
difficulties that may occur. All we can say is, that 
we shall act with all the zeal and perseverance to 
promote the public service, which may be in our 
power. It is a favorable circumstance, that the present Commission is certainly very acceptable to the 
whole State, unless a few land-jobbers be accepted. 
It is also pretty well ascertained, that McGillivray is 
desirous of peace ; and his word is a law to the 
Creeks. With my best respects to Mrs. Washington, 
love to the children, and compliments to the gentlemen of the family, I have the honor to be, my dear 
General, 
</p><p>
With the purest attachment, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=dah" rel="me">David Humphreys</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The number of Indians, I believe, does not 
amount to more than two thousand, notwithstanding 
the exaggerated accounts we had received.
