Sir. 
</p><p>
It gives me very sensible pleasure to find, from the act 
of Congress enclosed in your excellency's polite favour of 
the 1st inst., that my conduct in the chair and in the execution of public business has been honoured by the approbation of Congress. The testimony given of it by this act, 
demands my warmest acknowledgments. Be pleased, sir, 
to assure the Congress, that my happiness is inseparable 
from the welfare and esteem of my country, and that my 
endeavours to promote the one and merit the other, shall 
continue unremitted. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, 
</p><p>
With great respect and esteem, 
Your excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
