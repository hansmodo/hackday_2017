DEAR SIR, <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city origin'>London</a> <a rel="month origin" value="7">July</a> <a rel='day origin' value='13'>13</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1769' rel="origin">1769</a>.

I am honoured with yours of May loth, and agree with you 
perfectly in your sentiments of public affairs. Government 
here seems now to be growing more moderate with regard to 
America, and I am persuaded, that, by a steady, prudent 
conduct, we shall finally obtain all our important points, 
and establish American liberty on a clearer and firmer foundation. The folly of the late measures begins to be seen and 
understood at court; their promoters grow out of credit, 
and the trading part of the nation, with the manufacturers, 
are become sensible how necessary it is for their welfare to be 
on good terms with us. The petitioners of Middlesex and of 
London have numbered among their grievances the unconstitutional taxes on America, and similar petitions are expected 
from all quarters. So that I think we need only be quiet, 
and persevere in our schemes of frugality and industry, 
and the rest will do itself. 
</p><p>
Your governor is recalled, and it is said the commissioners 
will follow soon, or be new modelled with some more men of 
discretion among them. I am just setting out on a journey 
of five or six weeks, and have now only time to add, that I 
am, with the greatest esteem and regard, dear Sir, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
