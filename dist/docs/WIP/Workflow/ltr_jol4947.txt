My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I felicitate you upon the declaration of war between 
England and France ; for though we have no positive intelligence of the event, its immediate and sure 
precursors have taken place, from whence we may 
fairly conclude that it has followed in due course. 
The sarcastical declaration of Mons r de failles, 
proves the contempt which the French have for the 
British power in its present dismembered state, their 
confidence in their own strength seconded by that of 
their own allies, and is the most humiliating stroke 
that the national pride of Britain ever suffered. If she is not instantly driven to negotiate a disgraceful 
peace, she must principally depend upon powerful 
naval exertions. Her superiority in this kind of war, 
might gain her great advantages, and in some degree 
reestablish her affairs, were not American privateers, 
and the rising Continental army in the opposite scale. 
L'd North talks of new levies for internal defence. 
The idea of reinforcements to act offensively in America seems to be dropped. Indeed, my private 
opinion is, that's r Wm Howe or's r Harry Clinton 
has received orders to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> after 
doing as much mischief as possible. The great preparations which are making for a grand exhibition of 
pageantry, if it be true as it is said, that a new building which is now rising is intended for a ceremony 
relative to the order of knighthood, and every kind of show that is made of a design to remain in Philadelphia, rather confirm than shake my opinion. 
</p><p>
It gives me concern that there is no immediate prospect of closing the war with brilliancy. A successful 
general action, or some happy stroke upon one of 
the important points of which the enemy are at pre 
sent in possession, would be very desirable, as it 
would clearly establish the military reputation of our 
country, render us more independent of our allies, 
raise the character of our General, and give all young 
soldiers one more opportunity of distinguishing them 
selves in the dear cause of their country. 
</p><p>
I heard by mere accident from General's Clair that the legislative powers had ventured to alter the constitution of S Carolina, that it is now degenerated 
into an aristocracy. This has occasioned no less surprise than unhappiness in my mind. I should not have imagined that in a country where the people are 
generally enlightened, and of an independent spirit, we should have suffered the depositaries of our constitution to usurp a power which is inherent only in 
the people, and to have corrupted what they were 
delegated to preserve. If this passes with impunity, 
the same men may next vote themselves perpetual 
representatives of the people. A few men of powerful 
influence may next have credit enough to take all 
government into their own hands. To an oligarchy 
succeeds a monarchy, limited by a few checks, which 
may be easily removed by an artful prince, and 
make way for despotism. It will be said that the 
confederate states, and the temper of the Carolinians 
themselves, would never suffer corruption to go 
such lengths; but I only observe that it is of the 
most fatal tendency to suffer fundamental principles 
to be violated, and that the measures taken by our 
present representatives are subversive of liberty. If 
your leisure will permit, I entreat to send me some 
account of these transactions, or perhaps I shall be 
able to get it from Mr Drayton, who, I understand, 
is on his way to camp. 
</p><p>
The general officers are just now assembled to take 
the oath of allegiance. 
</p><p>
The independent States of America will have the 
first oath that ever I took. As this matter is intended 
for the vulgar, I think it a pit}* that more solemnity 
and awe is not attached to the ceremony. 
</p><p>
My dearest friend and father I tenderly embrace 
</p><p>
you.
