Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I hope my letter, in answer to the one which enclosed a 
number of your political pamphlets, has reached you by this 
time. I do not recollect the date, but it went in one of the 
last vessels. 
The cause of liberty, like most other good causes, will 
have its difficulties, and sometimes its persecutions, to 
struggle with. It has advanced more rapidly in this than 
other countries, but all its objects are not yet attained ; and 
I much doubt whether they ever will be, in this or any 
other terrestrial state. That men should pray and fight for 
their own freedom, and yet keep others in slavery, is certainly acting a very inconsistent, as well as unjust and, 
perhaps, impious part ; but the history of mankind is filled 
with instances of human improprieties. The wise and the 
good never form the majority of any large society, and it 
seldom happens that their measures are uniformly adopted ; 
or that they can always prevent being overborne themselves 
by the strong and almost never-ceasing union of the wicked 
and the weak. 
</p><p>
These circumstances tell us to be patient, and to moderate 
those sanguine expectations, which warm and good hearts 
often mislead even wise heads to entertain on those subjects. 
All that the best men can do is, to persevere in doing their 
duty to their country, and leave the consequences to Him 
who made it their duty ; being neither elated by success, 
however great, nor discouraged by disappointments however frequent and mortifying. 
</p><p>
With sincere esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
