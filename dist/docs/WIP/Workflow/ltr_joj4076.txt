Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The far greater part of my time since my arrival has 
been passed in the country, so that several vessels have 
lately gone to Europe, without letters from me to our 
friends there. 
</p><p>
The health of my family and myself is better than usual, 
and I begin to flatter myself that if you and Mrs. Vaughan 
could enjoy this country in only half the degree that I do, 
you would not greatly regret leaving Old England. I am 
more contented than I expected. Some tilings, it is true, 
are wrong, but more are right. Justice is well administered, offences are rare, and I have never known more 
public tranquillity or private security. Resentments subside very sensibly, though gradually. I have met with 
whigs and tories at the same table. The spirit of industry 
throughout the country was never greater. The productions of the earth abound. Prices have fallen since my 
arrival, though still much higher than formerly, especially 
the wages of mechanics and labourers, which are very extravagant. House-rent is more than double what it was 
before the war. 
</p><p>
Yours sincerely, 
</p><p>
