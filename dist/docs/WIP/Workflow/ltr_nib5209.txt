My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received your favor of the 14th inst. and 
regret much that it will not be in my power to negotiate 
the note you have forwarded, which is therefore returned 
to you herewith. Since my connection with the Bank I 
have been obliged to make it an invariable rule not to be a 
borrower from the Bank itself and not to be an indorser 
on notes discounted either there or in other institutions. 
To this I have on principle adhered, to the prejudice of my 
own interest, from a conviction that situated as I am, it 
was in all respects proper. I should feel more unwilling to 
act on it upon the present occasion if I did not know that 
it would not incommode you as you will find no difficulty 
in making the arrangement elsewhere. . . . 
</p>
