Sir, 
</p><p>
My last letter was dated at Charlotte, and forwarded by Lieutenant-Colonel Lee ; since which I have 
received your Excellency's favor of the 28th of September. I am happy to find the army under your 
command ready to commence operations against Lord 
Cornwallis ; but I am sorry to hear you think the 
issue somewhat doubtful. And it gives me great pain 
to find, that, whatever may be our success in Virginia, the circumstances of our ally will not permit them to cooperate with us in an attempt upon 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. The great importance of their present 
services demands our warmest gratitude ; but it is 
much to be regretted, that we cannot improve the 
advantage which our signal success would give us, as 
the hopes of our people, and the fears of the enemy, 
would greatly facilitate the reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. 
However, if you succeed in Virginia, it will enable 
you to support us more effectually here, if these 
States derive no other advantage from the present 
exertions of our allies. I will not suffer myself to 
doubt of your success, though I cannot help, at times, 
being greatly agitated between hope and fear, which 
alternately prevail, from the many incidents that occur in military operations, which may defeat the most 
flattering prospects ; and I find, by letters from Congress, as well as from your Excellency, that Sir Henry 
Clinton is making the most rapid preparations for 
some important blow. 
</p><p>
I mentioned, in one of my former letters, that I 
had been concerting with Governor Burke a plan for 
the reduction of Wilmington. General Rutherford is 
moving down towards that place with a considerable 
body of militia ; and I hear the enemy have left the 
place, and now occupy Brunswick, about thirty miles 
below; and, by preparations making in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> of 
small transports, I think it highly probable the enemy intend to take off the garrison. But this is only 
conjecture. 
</p><p>
Since the battle of Eutaw, our troops have been 
exceedingly sickly, and our distress and difficulties 
have been not a little increased for want of medicines and hospital stores. The malignity of the fevers begins to cease as the weather grows cool. The 
enemy are all in the lower country ; and nothing 
material has happened since my last, except a number of prisoners who have been taken by our light 
parties sent out by <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>. 
</p><p>
Inclosed, I send your Excellency a return of our 
strength, by which you will see our weak state. We 
can attempt nothing further, except in the partisan 
way. Some riflemen have arrived in camp from the 
mountains ; more are expected, which will enable us 
to keep up pretty strong parties for a time. But I look forward with pain to December, when the whole 
Virginia line will leave us. I hope measures will be 
taken before that period to reenforce us. To arrive 
here seasonably, they must move soon. Colonel Lee 
and Captain Pierce, I hope, have given you a full 
state of matters in this quarter, to enable you to 
take your measures without loss of time. 
</p><p>
I transmitted, by Captain Pierce, copies of all the 
letters and papers that had passed respecting Colonel Hayne's execution, mentioned in some of my former 
letters ; and, as I had not paper to copy them for 
your Excellency, I desired Captain Pierce to break 
the covers on his arrival at your camp, to give you 
an opportunity to see them, and inform yourself respecting the matter, as the business, in its consequences, might involve the whole Continent, and particularly the military part ; and, therefore, would ultimately rest with you. Should he have omitted this 
matter, of which I gave him a particular charge, I 
will forward you copies by the first opportunity. I 
wrote to Lord Cornwallis on the subject, but have 
not got his answer. 
</p><p>
You have my warmest wishes for your success, and 
my hearty prayers for your safety. With sentiments 
of the greatest respect and esteem, I am 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
