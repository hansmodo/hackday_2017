DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Favour of Feb y 27th, by Captain Carver, 
and thank you for giving me an Opportunity of being acquainted with so great a Traveller. I shall be glad if I can 
render him any service here.
</p><p>
The Parliament remain fix'd in their Resolution not to 
repeal the Duty Acts this Session, and will rise next Tuesday. 
I hope my Country folks will remain as fix'd in their Resolutions of Industry and Frugality till these Acts are repeaPd. 
And, if I could be sure of that, I should almost wish them 
never to be repealed; being persuaded, that we shall reap 
more solid and extensive Advantages from the steady Practice of those two great Virtues, than we can possibly suffer 
Damage from all the Duties the Parliament of this kingdom 
can levy on us. They flatter themselves you cannot long 
subsist without their Manufactures. They believe you have 
not Virtue enough to persist in such Agreements, they 
imagine the Colonies will differ among themselves, deceive 
and desert one another, and quietly one after the other submit to the Yoke, and return to the Use of British Fineries. 
They think, that, tho' the Men may be contented with homespun stuffs, the Women will never get the better of their 
Vanity and Fondness for English Modes and Gewgaws. 
The ministerial People all talk in this Strain, and many even 
of the Merchants. I have ventured to assert, that they will 
all find themselves mistaken ; and I rely so much on the Spirit 
of my Country, as to be confident I shall not be found a false 
Prophet, tho' at present not believed. 
</p><p>
I hope nothing that has happened, or may happen, will 
diminish in the least our Loyalty to our Sovereign, or Affection for this Nation in general. I can scarcely conceive a 
King of better Dispositions, of more exemplary Virtues, or 
more truly desirous of promoting the Welfare of all his Subjects. The Experience we have had of the Family in the two 
preceding mild Reigns, and the good Temper of our young 
Princes, so far as can yet be discovered, promise us a Continuance of this Felicity. The Body of this People, too, 
is of a noble and generous Nature, loving and honouring the 
Spirit of Liberty, and hating arbitrary Power of all sorts. 
We have many, very many, friends among them. 
</p><p>
But as to the Parliament ! tho' I might excuse that which 
made the Acts, as being surpriz'd & misled into the Measure ; 
I know not how to excuse this, which, under the fullest Conviction of its being a wrong one, resolves to continue it. 
It is decent, indeed, in your publick Papers to speak as you 
do of the "Wisdom and the Justice oj Parliament; 11 but now 
that the Subject is more thoroughly understood, if this new 
Parliament had been really wise, it would not have refused 
even to receive a Petition against the Acts ; and, if it had been 
just, it would have repealed them, and refunded the Money. 
Perhaps it may be wiser and juster another Year, but that 
is not to be depended on. 
</p><p>
If under all the Insults and Oppressions you are now ex
posed to, you can prudently, as you have lately done, continue 
quiet, avoiding Tumults, but still resolutely keeping up your 
Claim and asserting your Rights, you will finally establish 
them, and this military Cloud that now blusters over you will 
pass away, and do no more Harm than a Summer Thunder 
Shower. But the Advantages of your Perseverance in Industry and Frugality will be great and permanent. Your 
Debts will be paid, your Farms will be better improved, 
and yield a greater Produce ; your real Wealth will increase 
in a Plenty of every useful home Production, and all the true 
Enjoyments of Life, even tho' no foreign Trade should be 
allowed you; and this handicraft, shop-keeping State, will, 
for its own sake, learn to behave more civilly to its Customers. 
Your late governor, Mr. Pownall, appears a hearty Friend 
to America. He moved last week for a Repeal of the acts, 
and was seconded by General Conway, Sir George Saville, 
Mr. Jackson, Mr. Trecothic, and others, but did not succeed. 
A Friend has favoured me with a Copy of the Notes taken 
of Mr. PownalPs Speech, which I send you, believing it will 
be agreable to you and some other of our Friends to see 
them. You will observe in some Parts of it the Language 
a Member of Parliament is obliged to hold, on American 
topicks, if he would at all be heard in the House. He has 
given Notice that he will renew the Motion next and every 
Session. All Ireland is strongly in favour of the American 
cause. They have reason to sympathize with us. I send you 
four Pamphlets written in Ireland, or by Irish gentlemen 
here, in which you will find some excellent well-said Things. 
With the greatest Esteem, I am, my dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
