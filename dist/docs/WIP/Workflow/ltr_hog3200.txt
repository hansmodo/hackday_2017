SIR, 
</p><p>
I am just now honored with the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 14th instant, from White 
Marsh. I have never entertained the smallest idea 
that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> should be permitted to ex 
change the port of embarkation, or that the least 
variation of the spirit and letter of the Convention 
would be indulged to the troops under his command. 
There is no doubt but the British regiments, upon 
their arrival in England, will be ordered to do duty there; but the Germans cannot, by the laws, serve in 
Great Britain or Ireland. 
</p><p>
If <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> has any sinister design, what 
I suggested to Congress in my letter of the 10th 
instant, a copy of which I conclude your Excellency 
has received, will be a good method of delaying, if 
not finally preventing, the execution of his project. 
</p><p>
I shall write to-morrow, by the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> post, to 
General Glover, who is charged with the embarkation 
of the prisoners under the Convention, and send hima copy of your Excellency's letter. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant.
