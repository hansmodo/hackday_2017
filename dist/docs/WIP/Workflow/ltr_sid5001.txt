Sir, 
</p><p>
I was this morning informed of the arrival of Mr Arthur Lee, and that he would be in Paris tomorrow. This was 
surprising to me, as I knew of no particular affair that might call him here, and considering the extreme jealousy of the 
British Ministry at this time, and that Mr Lee was the agent of the United Colonies in Great Britain, and known to be 
such, I could wish, unless he had received some particular intelligence from the United Colonies, that he had suspended 
his visit, as I know not otherwise how he can serve me or my affairs, now (with the most grateful sense I mention it) 
in as favorable a course as the situation of the times will admit. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, etc.
