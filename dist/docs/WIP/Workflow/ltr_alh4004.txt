My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favours of the 26th November and 10th inst. have 
duly come to hand. I am ashamed that the former has 
remained so long unacknowledged; though I am persuaded 
my friends would readily excuse my delinquencies, could 
they appreciate my situation. 'Tis not the load of proper 
official business that alone engrosses me, though this would 
be enough to occupy any man. 'Tis not the extra attentions I am obliged to pay to the course of legislative manoeuvres, that alone adds to my burthen and perplexity. 
'Tis the malicious intrigues to stab me in the dark, against 
which 1 am too often obliged to guard myself, that distract 
and harass me to a point, which, rendering my situation 
scarcely tolerable, interferes with objects to which friendship and inclination would prompt me. 
</p><p>
I have not, however, been unmindful of the subject of 
your letters. Mr. Kino- will tell you the state the business 
was in. Nothing material has happened since. The representation will probably produce some effect, though not 
as great as ought to be expected. Some changes for the 
better, I trust, will take place. 
</p><p>
The success of the vice-president is as great a source of 
satisfaction, as that of Mr. Clinton would have been of mortification and pain to me. Willingly, however, would I 
relinquish my share of the command to the anti-federalists, 
if I thought they were to be trusted. But I have so many 
proofs of the contrary, as to make me dread the experiment 
of their preponderance. 
</p><p>
Very respectfully and affectionately, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
