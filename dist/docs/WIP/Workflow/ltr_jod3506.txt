MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS town is a small one, not larger than <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>. 
There are in it two German churches, the one Luther 
an, the other Calvinistical. The congregations are pretty numerous and their attendance upon public worship is decent. It is remarkable that the Germans-, 
wherever they are found, are careful to maintain the 
public worship, which is more than can be said of the 
other denominations of Christians, this way. There is 
one Church here erected by the joint contributions of 
Episcopalians and Presbyterians, but the minister, who 
is a missionary, is confined for Toryism, so that they 
have had for a long time no public worship. Congress have appointed two chaplains, Mr. White and 
Mr. Duffielcl, the former of whom, an Episcopalian, 
is arrived, and opens Congress with prayers every 
day. The latter is expected every hour. Mr. Duche, 
I am sorry to inform you, has turned out an apostate 
and a traitor. Poor man ! I pity his weakness and 
detest his wickedness. 
</p><p>
As to news we are yet in a painful suspense about 
affairs at the northward, but from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, we 
have accounts that are very pleasing. Commodore Hazelwood with his galleys, and Lieutenant Colonel Smith in the garrison of fort Mifflin, have behaved in 
a manner the most gallant and glorious. They have 
defended the river and the fort with a firmness and 
perseverance which does honor to human nature. If 
the news from the northward is true, Mr. Howe will 
scarcely venture upon winter quarters in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
We are waiting for news from Rhode Island. 
</p><p>
I am wearied with the life I lead, and long for the 
joys of my family. God grant I may enjoy it in 
peace. Peace is my dear delight. War has no charms 
for me. If I live much longer in banishment I shall 
scarcely know my own children. Tell my little ones, 
that if they will be very good, papa will come home.
