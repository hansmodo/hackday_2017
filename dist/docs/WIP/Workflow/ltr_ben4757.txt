MY DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your excellent paper on the preferable use of 
oxen in agriculture, and have put it in the way of being communicated to the public here. I have observed in America, 
that the farmers are more thriving in those parts of the country where cattle are used, than in those where the labour is 
done by horses. The latter are said to require twice the 
quantity of land to maintain them ; and after all are not good 
to eat, at least we do not think them so. Here is a waste of 
land that might afford subsistence for so many of the human 
species. Perhaps it was for this reason, that the Hebrew 
lawgiver, having promised that the children of Israel should 
be as numerous as the sands of the sea, not only took care to 
secure the health of individuals by regulating their diet, 
that they might be fitter for producing children, but also 
forbid their using horses, as those animals would lessen the 
quantity of subsistence for men. Thus we find, when they 
took any horses from their enemies, they destroyed them; 
and in the commandments, where the labour of the ox and 
ass is mentioned, and forbidden on the Sabbath, there is 
no mention of the horse, probably because they were to have 
none. And, by the great armies suddenly raised in that small 
territory they inhabited, it appears to have been very full of 
people. 
</p><p>
Food is always necessary to all; and much the greatest 
part of the labour of mankind is employed in raising provisions for the mouth. Is not this kind of labour, then, the 
fittest to be the standard by which to measure the values of 
all other labour, and consequently of all other things whose 
value depends on the labour of making or procuring them? 
May not even gold and silver be thus valued ? If the labour 
of the farmer, in producing a bushel of wheat, be equal to 
the labour of the miner in producing an ounce of silver, will 
not the bushel of wheat just measure the value of the ounce 
of silver. The miner must eat ; the farmer indeed can live 
without the ounce of silver, and so perhaps will have some 
advantage in settling the price. But these discussions I 
leave to you, as being more able to manage them; only, 
I will send you a little scrap I wrote some time since on the 
laws prohibiting foreign commodities. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on your election as president of your 
Edinburgh Society. I think I formerly took notice to you in 
conversation, that I thought there had been some similarity 
in our fortunes, and the circumstances of our lives. This 
is a fresh instance, for, by letters just received, I find that I 
was about the same time chosen president of our American 
Philosophical Society, established at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
I have sent by sea, to the care of Mr. Alexander, a little 
box, containing a few copies of the late edition of my books, 
for my friends in Scotland. One is directed for you, and one 
for your Society, which I beg that you and they would accept 
as a small mark of my respect. With the sincerest esteem 
and regard, I am, my dear friend, yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. I am sorry my letter of <a href='/results.php?year=1767'>1767</a>, concerning the American disputes, miscarried. I now send you a copy of it from 
my book. The Examination mentioned in it you have probably seen. Things daily wear a worse aspect, and tend more 
and more to a breach and final separation.
