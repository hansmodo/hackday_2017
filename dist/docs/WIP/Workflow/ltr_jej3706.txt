Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favors of the 14th of December last and the 
11th instant, have been duly received. A series of 
ill health through the fall and the greatest part of 
the winter, which, until very lately, rendered my attendance in Congress seldom, and very irregular, 
must be my apology for suffering the first to remain 
so long unanswered. 
</p><p>
Congress have been, for some time past, almost 
wholly employed in devising some general and adequate funds for paying the interest, and in time sinking the principal, of the public debt, as well as to 
provide for future loans, should the continuance of the 
war render borrowing necessary. Difficulties, apparently insurmountable, presented themselves in almost 
every stage of the business, owing to the different 
circumstances of the several States, and the necessity 
that the subjects, selected for taxation to form the 
funds, should operate throughout them all, generally 
and equally, or nearly so, to make them acceptable. 
</p><p>
After opening and discussing a variety of questions, 
no object has been yet discovered to which so few 
objections lie, as the impost duty formerly recommended to the States, and which, with some alterations from the former plan, to obviate the objections that have been raised, has been agreed to in a Committee of the Whole, and will, I think, be finally 
adopted. what this duty, when granted by the 
States, will amount to annually, is very uncertain. 
In time of peace, there can be no doubt but it will 
be considerable, and for years prove an increasing fund ', but it is thought by no means adequate to the 
payment of the interest, and sinking the principal, 
of the national debt. Other means have, therefore, 
been considered in aid of the impost duty, land, polls, 
salt, wine, spirits, tea, &c. ; these last, being what are 
called luxuries, it is thought may bear a small tax in 
addition to the impost duty I fear, at present, few 
of them will go down; and that we shall be obliged, 
at last, to rest the payment of the public debt upon 
the mode prescribed by the Confederation (requisitions 
proportioned on the States according to the value of 
land, buildings, &c., a plan for obtaining which scale 
of proportion has been digested, and agreed upon in 
Congress, and will immediately go on to the States), 
and the produce of the five per cent, duty, if granted. A small poll-tax, did not the constitution of 
Maryland stand in the way, might probably succeed, 
as it would operate more equally, perhaps, than any 
other, and may be adopted, allowing Maryland to substitute some other adequate and productive fund in 
its room. 
</p><p>
A short time will bring to a conclusion our efforts 
on this business, which I am in hopes will terminate 
in the adoption of such measures as may be acceptable to the States, and produce the granting such 
funds as will restore public credit, give value to the 
great mass of depreciated certificates, and enable Congress to render to every class of the public creditors 
ample justice. Congress have the purest intentions 
towards the public creditors, and will use their best 
exertions in obtaining from the States the means to 
do them speedy and complete justice. 
</p><p>
Such is their opinion of the merit and services of 
the army, that, did it not wound the sense of justice, 
they want not the inclination to give them the preference to any other class of creditors ; but equity 
and sound policy forbid discrimination and partial 
distinctions. One ground of discontent in the army, 
and on which they found the opinion that justice is 
not intended to be done to them, is the delay in 
complying with their requests ; but, with those acquainted with the deliberations of public bodies, and 
especially with so mixed a body as that of Congress, 
allowances will be made for slow determination. Every 
class of public creditors must know the inability of 
Congress to pay their demands, unless furnished with 
the means by the several States; and the exertions 
of that body have not been wanting, heretofore, to 
obtain the means, though they have not produced the 
desired effect. The measures now digesting will, there 
is good reason to expect, prove more efficacious for 
obvious reasons. 
</p><p>
Reports are freely circulated here, that there are 
dangerous combinations in the army ; and, within a 
few days past, it has been said, they are about to 
declare they will not disband until their demands are 
complied with. I trust these reports are not well 
founded, and that the army will exercise, awhile 
longer at least, that patient forbearance, which hath 
hitherto so honorably distinguished them. To you it 
must be unnecessary to observe, that when once all 
confidence between the civil and military authority 
is lost, by intemperate conduct, or an assumption of 
improper power, especially by the military body, the Rubicon is passed, and to retreat will be very difficult, from the fears and jealousies that will unavoidably subsist between the two bodies. To avoid, therefore, the adoption by the army of any hasty and 
rash measure, should employ the attention, and draw 
forth the exertions of every worthy officer in it ; for 
from these alone can opposition be expected. 
</p><p>
The ambition of some, and the pressure of distress 
in others, may produce dangerous combinations, founded on the pretence that justice is delayed and will 
be refused to them. The pretext is plausible and ensnaring, and may draw into engagements the unsuspecting, honest soldier, from which it will be difficult 
to extricate himself, even when he sees the dangers 
they lead to. If there are men in the army who 
harbour wicked designs, and are determined to blow 
the coals of discord, they will gradually endeavour to 
hurt the reputation of those averse to their projects, 
and by sinister practices lessen their weight and influence among the soldiery. I have lately heard 
there are those who are abandoned enough to use 
their arts to lessen your popularity in the army ; in 
hopes, ultimately, the weight of your opposition will 
prove no obstacle to their ambitious designs. If this 
be true, and they are likely to succeed, I own it 
will prove a bad prognostic of the future. I shall 
be among the number of those who entertain fears 
of the army, and doubt that peace will not be followed by its usual blessings to America. Whether to 
temporize, or oppose with steady, unremitting firmness, what is supposed to be in agitation of dangerous tendency, or that may be agitated, must be left 
to your own sense of propriety, and better judgment. 
</p><p>
With respect to the business of Vermont, I think 
you need not be uneasy from apprehensions that the army, or any part of them, Y/ill be employed to enforce a compliance with the act of the 5th of December last, should the people of Vermont refuse a 
compliance with that demand ; at least for some time 
to come, if ever. To go into detail upon this matter would be prolix, and rather improper for the 
scope of a letter. It cannot be denied, that the act 
of Congress of the 20th of August [<a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>], opened the 
prospect to Vermont of an acknowledgment of their 
independence, and admission into the Union. Although it gave ground of hope, it was not conclusive ; and the Legislature of Vermont, absolutely rejecting the offer, and recommending to the people an 
inviolable adherence to their union and encroachments 
on the adjoining States, as well as other unwarrantable acts they have unjustly concealed from the public in their remonstrance, released Congress from their 
offer, and left them at liberty afterwards to accept or 
refuse, as they saw fit, when Vermont, repenting of 
her conduct at a future period, complied. 
</p><p>
A particular state of things produced the act of 
Congress ; a change of circumstances afterwards dictated the delay in determining on their proposition, 
and the report of a Committee, to whom it was referred. This report authorizes observations I decline 
to make. This proceeding in Congress they style 
a violation of the compact entered into with them. 
There always has been a strong opposition to the 
claims of Vermont, and their admission into the 
Union. Virginia has generally been among the number of her opponents, not so much, perhaps, upon 
the question of independence, as the impolicy of her 
admission into the Union while several very important questions of local concern remained undetermined; 
and, until these great points are settled, the consent of Virginia, I expect, will be withheld, and, if before 
obtained, it will be a sacrifice of her opinion to the 
peace and common weal of the United States. 
</p><p>
If Vermont confines herself to the limits assigned 
to her, and ceases to encroach upon and disturb the 
quiet of the adjoining States, at the same time avoiding combinations, or arts, hostile to the United States, 
she may be at rest within her limits, and, by patient 
waiting the convenient time, may ere long be admitted to the privileges of Union. The influence Vermont has gained in 'the army, and in some of the 
States that espouse her cause, do little credit to the 
parties concerned; and to this influence is in a great 
measure to be ascribed the variable, indecisive conduct of Congress respecting the claims of that people. 
The remonstrance states the receipt of official letters 
recommending a compliance with the act of Congress, 
and intimates yours to be of the number; and that 
these communications influenced them to comply. 
The assertion is wrong as to yours, and may be 
equally false as to others, and is one proof, among 
a variety of others, of the disingenuity and want of 
candor in Vermont. It exhibits, also, very little respect to this body, when they ascribe their compliance to other motives than the recommendation of 
Congress. 
</p><p>
Seven States have voted five years' whole pay as 
the commutation for the half-pay to the officers; but 
the resolution has not passed the House, being postponed, for the present, from an opinion prevalent with 
many, that the consent of nine States is necessary 
to give it validity. Delaware and Georgia are absent; 
were they represented, probably the vote would be 
sufficient. 
</p><p>
That we shall have peace soon, is almost reduced 
to a certainty; but my fears are, it will not be 
attended with those blessings generally expected. 
There are so many great questions, very interesting 
to particular States, unsettled, which require speedy 
determination to preserve quiet, that it is difficult to 
avoid uneasy impressions for their consequences. The 
present conjuncture, perhaps, above all others America 
has experienced, calls for good dispositions in the 
States, and moderation and wisdom in their counsels. 
May the spirit of Union govern them, is the earnest 
wish of, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant,
