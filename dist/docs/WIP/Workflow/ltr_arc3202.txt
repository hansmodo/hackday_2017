SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Burr</a> arrived here about three o clock, from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague met'>General McDougall</a>, and brings intelligence of the surrender of the Fort upon Verplank's Point, yesterday, 
about eleven o clock, by capitulation. The garrison 
are prisoners of war, and the officers have liberty to 
wear their side-arms. 
</p><p>
I have no letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague met'>General McDougall</a>; but he 
is clearly of opinion the enemy mean to attack the 
posts (at least Fort Arnold, the carrying of which 
would open to them the navigation of the river) 
in the Highlands. <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Burr</a> informs me, that, 
by landing near where Fort Montgomery stood, and 
marching to the Forest of Dean, they would fall intoa clove, which runs entirely round that ridge on 
which the forts are situated, and through which a 
road might be made almost as fast as an army could 
march. By this clove <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague met'>General McDougall</a> thinks the 
forts will be invested. Betwixt this clove and Smith's 
is a chain of hideous mountains, but through them 
are, no doubt, many passes, with which they may 
be made acquainted by the inhabitants whom they 
have debauched, and would thereby be able to give 
much annoyance to any convoys that might pass by 
Smith's, supposing it necessary to make use of that 
road. 
</p><p>
It seems to be <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague met'>General McDougall</a>'s wish that I 
should move to <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a>, and he thinks that the 
occupying Butter Hill might prevent the attack upon 
Fort Arnold from the upper side. At the same time 
the state of the provision is very alarming. Not 
much above three weeks in the respective forts, and 
the militia called in; and their principal dependence 
for further supplies is upon their being transported 
across the country, from Sussex or Delaware. 
</p><p>
I think I could easily reach <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a>, or at 
least be so far advanced, through the clove, as to be 
out of all clanger of being intercepted. But it is necessary first to have intelligence from the river, lest 
the parts of your army on this side of it should be 
too much separated, and exposed to be beaten by 
piecemeal. This I will endeavour to procure, and act 
according to circumstances, of which I will take care 
to give your Excellency notice. Notwithstanding the 
general opinion, that the forts are the enemy's object, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Burr</a> mentions circumstances that leave it 
still doubtful. Their troops are landed at various 
places on the east side of the river, and at Haverstraw on the west; and, after the surrender of the 
fort, their largest armed vessel, supposed to be of 
eighteen guns, and a galley, which had passed be 
fore, were seen towing down again. 
</p><p>
As the passage through the clove is somewhat dangerous for single persons, I shall send two horsemen 
back with <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Burr</a>, and shall, through him, communicate to <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague met'>General McDougall</a> verbally. It may, 
perhaps, be necessary to form a march through the 
clove, in which case, I shall leave my baggage at this 
place, to be forwarded afterwards, as your Excellency 
may think proper. 
</p><p>
Our provision wagons will not be able to supply 
us, when at a greater distance, four only being al 
lowed to each brigade, and three of these broke down 
upon the road. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
ARTHUR ST. CLAIR.
