My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have written to day as I said I would to Mr Gales my present purpose as far as You are concerned is to avoid 
all seism between You &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a>. I should for many reasons prefer in the first instance the union of the two names on the 
same ticket as an assurance both here &amp; in Europe of your cordiality. If any reason should dissuade from that, the next 
thing is for You to be unconnected with <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay's</a> administration &amp; "bide your time" . . .
