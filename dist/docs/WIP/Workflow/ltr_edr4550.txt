Sir, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor of enclosing to you a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague'>Mr Jefferson</a>, announcing my succession to him, as Secretary of 
State. His resignation, which took place on the 31st ultimo, 
was accompanied with a general regret, founded on his acknowledged qualities for that department, and the important 
services rendered by his labors. 
</p><p>
The only letter, which I find, Sir, from you unanswered, is that of June 25th, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>. It is thought advisable by the 
President to defer all animadversions upon the decree, to which it relates, and indeed upon any of the affairs of France, 
until the temper of that country towards the United States shall be disclosed by your communications, subsequent to the 
receipt of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague'>Mr Jefferson's</a> letter to you, of the 16th of August, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>. 
</p><p>
The journals and pamphlets, now sent, will inform you of 
the progress made by Congress on the very interesting subjects, which have hitherto occupied them. 
</p><p>
Suffer me to tender to you, on this first occasion of our 
correspondence, the great and sincere respect, with which I 
have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=edr" rel="me">EDMUND RANDOLPH</a>.
