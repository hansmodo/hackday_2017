SIR: 
</p><p>
I was not less surprised than concerned on receipt of your letter to 
day, to find you at Wasmasaw, instead of being on the other side of Santee. Mr. Singleton, who was the express that carried the letter 
for you, deserves to be hanged. Pray, find him out, and have him 
confined, for he shall certainly answer for this infamous piece of negligence. Had you received the letter on Sunday morning, which was 
the time you ought to have got it, <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> might, in all probability, 
have been saved; but it must now, beyond all doubt, be lost. The last 
of the British troops, 170 in number, did not quit Charlestown until 
yesterday afternoon; you could, therefore, have been a full days march 
ahead of them, besides, your then position being so much nearer the 
scene of action than that of the enemy s. On the contrary, they will 
now have a days march of you, consequently the fall of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> 
must inevitably follow, and which must be a dreadful stroke to us. 
The whole of the land forces said to be employed on this expedition is 
about 700. If any thing can be done to save the place, or any part of 
the stores, I am sure your utmost endeavors I can depend on. I am 
convinced the opportunity is lost. Pray, let me hear from you as soon 
as anything is done, and what is the fate of the place. 
I am, sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
