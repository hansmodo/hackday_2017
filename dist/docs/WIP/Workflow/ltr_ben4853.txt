DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I received yours of June soth. I am vexed that my letter 
to you, written at Glasgow, miscarried; not so much that 
you did not receive it, as that it is probably in other hands. 
It contained some accounts of what passed in Ireland, which 
were for you only. 
</p><p>
As Lord Hillsborough in fact got nothing out of me, I 
should rather suppose he threw me away as an orange that 
would yield no juice, and therefore not worth more squeezing. 
When I had been a little while returned to London, I waited 
on him to thank him for his civilities in Ireland, and to discourse with him on a Georgia affair. The porter told me 
he was not at home. I left my card, went another time, and 
received the same answer, though I knew he was at home, a 
friend of mine being with him. After intermissions of a week 
each, I made two more visits, and received the same answer. 
The last time was on a levee day, when a number of carriages 
were at his door. My coachman driving up, alighted, and 
was opening the coach door, when the porter, seeing me, 
came out, and surlily chid the coachman for opening the door 
before he had inquired whether my Lord was at home ; and 
then turning to me, said, "My Lord is not at home." I have 
never since been nigh him, and we have only abused one 
another at a distance. 
</p><p>
The contrast, as you observe, is very striking between his 
conversation with the chief justice, and his letter to you concerning your province. I know him to be as double and 
deceitful as any man I ever met with. But we have done 
with him, I hope, for ever. His removal has, I believe, been 
meditated ever since the death of the Princess Dowager. For 
I recollect, that on my complaining of him about that time 
to a friend at court, whom you may guess, he told me, we 
Americans were represented by Hillsborough as an unquiet 
people, not easily satisfied with any ministry ; that, however, 
it was thought too much occasion had been given us to dislike 
the present ; and asked me, whether, if he should be removed, 
I could name another likely to be more acceptable to us. 
I said, "Yes, there is Lord Dartmouth; we liked him very 
well when he was at the head of the Board formerly, and 
probably should like him again." This I heard no more 
of, but I am pretty sure it was reported where I could wish it, 
though I know not that it had any effect. 
</p><p>
As to my situation here, nothing can be more agreeable, 
especially as I hope for less embarrassment from the new 
minister ; a general respect paid me by the learned, a number 
of friends and acquaintance among them, with whom I have 
a pleasing intercourse; a character of so much weight, that 
it has protected me when some in power would have done me 
injury, and continued me in an office they would have deprived me of; my company so much desired, that I seldom 
dine at home in winter, and could spend the whole summer 
in the country-houses of inviting friends, if I chose it. 
Learned and ingenious foreigners, that come to England, 
almost all make a point of visiting me ; for my reputation is 
still higher abroad than here. Several of the foreign ambassadors have assiduously cultivated my acquaintance, treating 
me as one of their corps, partly I believe from the desire they 
have, from time to time, of hearing something of American 
affairs, an object become of importance in foreign courts, 
who begin to hope Britain's alarming power will be diminished by the defection of her colonies; and partly that they 
may have an opportunity of introducing me to the gentlemen 
of their country who desire it. The King, too, has lately 
been heard to speak of me with great regard. 
</p><p>
These are flattering circumstances; but a violent longing 
for home sometimes seizes me, which I can no otherwise 
subdue but by promising myself a return next spring or next 
fall, and so forth. As to returning hither, if I once go back, I 
have no thoughts of it. I am too far advanced in life to propose three voyages more. I have some important affairs to 
settle at home, and, considering my double expenses here and 
there, I hardly think my salaries fully compensate the disadvantages. The late change, however, being thrown into 
the balance, determines me to stay another winter. 
</p><p>
August 22d. I find I omitted congratulating you on the 
honour of your election into the Society for propagating the 
Gospel. There you match indeed my Dutch honour. But 
you are again behind, for last night I received a letter from 
Paris, of which the enclosed is an extract, acquainting me 
that I am chosen Associe Etr anger (foreign member) of the 
Royal Academy there. There are but eight of these Associes 
Etrangers in all Europe, and those of the most distinguished 
names of science. The vacancy I have the honour of filling 
was made by the death of the late celebrated Van Swieten of 
Vienna. This mark of respect from the first academy in the 
world, which Abbe' Nollet, one of its members, took so much 
pains to prejudice against my doctrines, I consider as a kind 
of victory without ink-shed, since I never answered him. I 
am told he has but one of his sect now remaining in the Academy. All the rest, who have in any degree acquainted themselves with electricity, are as he calls them Franklinists.
</p><p>
Yours, &c. B. FRANKLIN.
