SIR, 
</p><p>
It is with the highest pleasure I comply with the 
order of Congress, in conveying to you the inclosed 
resolve, expressing the thanks of that body to you 
for the wise and well-concerted attack upon the enemy, near Germantown, on the 4th instant, and also 
to the officers and soldiers for their brave exertions 
on that occasion; and I must request you will communicate to them the distinguished mark of the approbation of their country. 
</p><p>
It is indeed true, that the best designs and boldest efforts may sometimes fail of success, through 
unforeseen incidents, yet is it a source of satisfaction 
to reflect, in such instances, that every thing has 
been done to insure success, that human wisdom 
could devise. Something must still be left to fortune. 
It is not in mortals to command success. But permit 
me to say, Sir, you have done more on this occasion ; 
you have deserved it. 
</p><p>
Wishing, with the utmost sincerity, that your great 
and virtuous exertions in the cause of freedom and 
your country may be crowned with victory, I have 
the honor to be, with perfect esteem and respect. Sir, 
Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
