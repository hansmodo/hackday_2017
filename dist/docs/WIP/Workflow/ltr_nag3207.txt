SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed copy of a representation from Colonel 
Barry, an Assistant Deputy-Quartermaster-General in 
this State, will show your Excellency that a new 
difficulty has arisen to delay transportation. It is 
very unfortunate that we should lose the advantage 
of this favorable term of conveyance, as the time is 
just at hand when it will be almost impossible to 
bring forward the supplies. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants are unwilling to give their aid, at 
the prices regulated by law, unless the regulation 
extends through all the States. I do not consider 
myself authorized to instruct my agents to break 
over the laws of the State; and now find a stagnation in bringing on the provisions. 
</p><p>
People will withhold their services in this State, 
as long as they receive a less compensation than 
their neighbours. They seem to claim it as a right, 
that they be allowed their usual prices until the 
other States adopt measures for enforcing a regulation. I do not hear them object to have a limitation 
of prices take place ; but they insist upon its not 
being binding on them till it is so on others. your Excellency can foresee the consequences of the present difficulty, and will direct and authorize me in 
what manner to proceed. I am your Excellency's 
Most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
