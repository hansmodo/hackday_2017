Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I must freely acknowledge the justice of your charge 
against me as a bad correspondent, for the force of truth 
would convict, were I to deny, and perhaps friendship will 
hardly bear with palliatives ; but knowing well your attachment to, and practice of sincerity, I shall honestly tell you I 
did not like to write on political matters, and in what may 
be called domestic, you had constantly better information 
than 'twas possible for me to give, having also very ample 
employment for my time : you will reflect, that all these 
circumstances combined to make me silent, although not 
inattentive or forgetful of my friends abroad. 
</p><p>
I have three letters from you, dated the 28th May, 16th 
September, and 19th November last, and feel myself exceedingly indebted to that partiality which prompted you to 
say many civil things ; these are stamped with an unusual 
value, not because I sutler myself to think they are merited, 
but because you thought so. We have heard more of you 
and Mrs. Jay than these letters tell me, and upon the whole 
have not found much cause to be pleased with your situation. Hers must too often have been very disagreeable ; 
the loss of the little one was truly distressing, and your 
almost constant absence extremely hard. But you must 
comfort yourselves with the reflection that still more cruel 
things might have happened, had you remained in your own 
country. Suppose you had been with your father, when 
some of the enemy's ruffians broke into the house, and after 
satiating themselves with plunder, they had carried you, 
my dear friend, a prisoner to New- York. Think of the 
triumph of your enemies, the distress of your friends, and 
what you must, under such circumstances, have suffered : 
happy that you have escaped such an event, I will not 
prolong the idea of it. 
</p><p>
Our friend <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur</a> has acquainted you with my appointment to be superintendant of finance ; the motives of 
my acceptance are purely patriotic, and I would this moment give much of my property to be excused ; but pressed 
by my friends, acquaintances, fellow-citizens, and almost 
by all America, I could not resist. I will therefore most 
assiduously try to be useful, and if in this I do but succeed, 
my recompense will be ample. <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur</a> and others 
have promised me the assistance of their abilities. Congress promise support; if the Legislatures and individuals 
will do the same, we will soon change the face of our 
affairs, and show our enemies that their hopes of our ruin, 
through the channel of finance, is as vain as their hope of 
conquest. 
</p><p>
This campaign, as usual, opens to our disadvantage ; but 
I expect it will also, as usual, close favourably for us. The 
vices and follies of our enemies may justly be counted 
among the number of our fast friends. They never fail to 
work for our relief in the hour of distress ; for at those 
times the pride, insolence, and tyranny of the British heroes 
are too insufferable to be borne, even by the peasantry of 
America. It affords me much pleasure to find the assistance I have given towards delivering supplies at Havannah, 
is known and approved by the ministry at the court of 
Madrid; as a favourable impression there may be serviceable to my administration of the finances, and I hope still to 
return more important services for those T expect from 
them to this distressed country. Adieu, my dear sir: with 
sincere affection. I am 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant,
