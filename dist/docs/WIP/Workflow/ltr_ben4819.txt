I SHOULD have been happy in accompanying your Lordship 
on that agreable Party, or in being at Twyford instead of this 
dusty Town; but Business kept me here longer than I expected. I now purpose to set out on Tuesday next, if nothing at present unforeseen does not happen to prevent me. I hope 
to find the good Family well, which will add greatly to the 
Pleasure I promise myself in that sweet Retreat. With the 
greatest Respect, I am,
