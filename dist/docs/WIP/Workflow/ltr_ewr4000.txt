My dear Jay, 
</p><p>
I expected long ere this to have been seated quietly at 
home ; but the progress which the enemy had made, and 
seemed likely to make, into your country, induced me to 
suspend my resolution which I came to several months ago, 
and assist with the whole of my power (little enough, God 
knows) a State which appeared to be marked for destruction. The storm, however, has passed away ; and though I 
have reason to dread its bursting upon the heads of my 
countrymen, I cannot but most sincerely congratulate you 
upon the event. I wish you may improve the time ; and if 
you can concur with me in sentiment, it will be improved 
in the following manner. Let Schuyler, whose reputation 
has been deeply wounded by the malevolence of party spirit, 
immediately repair to Congress, and after establishing himself in the good opinion of his countrymen, by a fair and 
open inquiry into his conduct, concert with the House such 
a plan as he shall think will effectually secure all the upper 
country against the attacks of the enemy ; which plan being 
agreed to by the House, give him full power to effect it, 
and send him off with all possible despatch to carry it into 
execution. Let steps be taken to place real obstructions in 
the North River, at least in that part of it which can be commanded by Fort Montgomery, and the other fort in the 
highlands. If these things be done, and that soon, your 
country, I think, will be safe ; provided you establish a 
good government, with a strong executive. A pure democracy may possibly do, when patriotism is the ruling 
passion; but when the State abounds with rascals, as is the 
case with too many at this day, you must suppress a little 
of that popular spirit. Vest the executive powers of government in an individual, that they may have vigour, and 
let them be as ample as is consistent with the great outlines 
of freedom. As several of the reasons which operated mst you or Livingston's leaving the State are now 
removed, I think you would be of vast service in Congress. 
You know that body possesses its share of human weakness ; and that it is not impossible for the members of that 
House to have their attention engrossed by subjects which 
might as well be postponed for the present, while such as 
require despatch have been — I had almost said — neglected. 
This may he the case with the measures which should be 
taken. for the defence of your State. It is therefore your 
interest and your duty, if you are not prevented by some 
superior public concern, to attend the House, and that soon : 
you have a right to demand their attention, and I trust they 
will give you early assistance. 
</p><p>
Every intelligence from New- York for the last ten days 
convincing me that the enemy are preparing to attack 
the State with a large body of troops, I shall take the wings 
of the morning and hasten to mv native home ; where I 
shall endeavour to render my country more service in the 
field, than I have been able to render her in the cabinet. I 
have therefore little time to write, and none to lengthen this 
letter. I could not, however, think of quitting this part of 
the continent without writing you what appeared to me of 
consequence ; especially when I consider that it is probable, 
at least possible, that this may be the last time I may have 
it in my power to give you any evidence of my affection. 
I shall add no more than that you have my best wishes for 
your happiness, and that if I fall in the defence of my 
country, it will alleviate my misfortune to think that it is in 
the support of the best of causes, and that I am esteemed by 
one of the best of men. God bless you. Adieu, my friend.

Yours, sincerely,
