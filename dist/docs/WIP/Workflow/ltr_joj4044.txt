Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last to you was written on the 16th November, since which I have not had the pleasure of hearing from you. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the successful issue of the last campaign, to the brilliancy of which the late surrender of Fort St. Philip, at Mahon, has much contributed. 
</p><p>
Your hemisphere brightens fast, and there is reason to hope another vigorous campaign will be followed by halcyon days. 
</p><p>
Mr. Benson writes me that your judges are industriously serving their country, but that their country had not, as yet, 
made an adequate provision for them. This is bad policy, and poverty cannot excuse it. The bench is at present 
well filled; but it should be remembered, that although we are told that Justice should be blind, vet there are no 
proverbs which declare that she ought also to be hungry. Assure these gentlemen of my esteem ; and believe me to be, dear sir, with sincere attachment, 
</p><p>
Your friend and servant, 
</p><p>
