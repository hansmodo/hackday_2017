DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
From many different accounts the enemy threatens us with an attack. 
We have had no small uneasiness in our camp for want of pay, clothing 
and spirits. The discontent has reached the enemy, and it is confidently asserted that they are coming out to take advantage of it. I 
</p><p>
think it necessary, therefore, as I am not well informed of the full ex 
tent of the discontent, to call our force together from all parts, as well 
to awe the malcontents, if any there be, as to prevent the enemy from 
attempting anything in consequence thereof. I beg you will, therefore, 
march and join us as soon as possible, with all your force, except a 
small recounoitering party; and, although this may expose a greater 
part of the country, yet it will serve to secure a greater object. I beg 
you will lose no time. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
