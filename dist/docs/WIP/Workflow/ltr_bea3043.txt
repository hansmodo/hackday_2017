Second Portage from <a href='/results.php?city=kennebec river' rel='city origin'>Kennebec</a> to the Dead River, <a rel="day origin" value="13">13</a> <a rel="month origin" value="10">October</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775" rel="origin">1775</a>.

MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
A person going down the river presents the first 
opportunity I have had of writing to your Excellency 
since I left <a href='/results.php?city=fort western' rel='city'>Fort Western</a> ; since which we have had 
a very fatiguing time. The men in general not understanding bateaux, have been obliged to wade, and 
haul them more than half way up the river. The 
last division is just arrived- three divisions are over 
the first carrying-place, and as the men are in high 
spirits, I make no doubt of reaching the Elver Chau-diere in eight or ten days, the greatest difficulty 
being, I hope, already past. We have now with us 
about twenty-five days provisions for the whole detachment, consisting of about nine hundred and fifty 
effective men. I intend making an exact return, but 
must defer it until I come to Chaudiere. 
</p><p>
I have ordered the Commissary to hire people acquainted with the river, and forward on the provisions left behind (about one hundred barrels) to the 
Great Carrying-place, to secure our retreat. The Expense will be considerable, but when set in competition with the lives or liberty of so many brave men, 
I think it trilling- and if we succeed, the provisions 
will not be lost, I have had no intelligence from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>, and expect none till I reach Chaudiere Pond, where I expect a return of my express, 
and to determine my plan of operation, of which, as 
it is to be governed by circumstances, I can say no 
more than, if we are obliged to return, I believe we 
shall have a sufficiency of provisions to reach this place, where the supply I ordered the Commissary to 
send forward will enable us to return on our way 
home, so far that your Excellency will be able to relieve us. If we proceed on, we shall have a sufficient stock to reach the French inhabitants (where we can be supplied), if not Quebec. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency may possibly think we have been tardy in our march, as we have gained so little; but when you consider the badness and weight of the 
bateaux, and large quantity of provisions, &c., we have been obliged to force up against a very rapid stream, where you would have taken the men for 
amphibious animals, as they were a great part of the time under water; add to this the great fatigue in 
portage; you will think I have pushed the men as fast as they could possibly bear. The officers, volunteers, and privates in general, have acted with the 
greatest spirit and industry. I am, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have inclosed a copy of my journal, which 
I fancied your Excellency might be glad to see.
