Sir, 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to inclose to you a Kentucky paper, wherein is published an extract from 
one of Mr. Brown's letters respecting the Spanish 
business. My reason for doing this is, that you may 
judge how far it confirms a representation I formerly 
had the honor to make to you on that subject. The 
part I then publicly took in this affair, has entirely 
excluded me from any knowledge of his subsequent 
communications to his confidential friends. 
</p><p>
You will discover, by the paper I send you, to 
what lengths matters have been carried. Every thing 
relative to this matter, on the part of Mr. Brown, 
has, by his friends and coadjutors, been denied or 
concealed, which has produced a necessity for the inclosed publication. I shall only take the liberty of 
adding, that a great majority of the people of this 
district appear to be well disposed to the Government 
of the United States, though they have, through the 
influence and industry of his confidential friends, again 
elected Mr. Brown to Congress ; and that our official 
and influential characters having taken the oath to 
support the General Government, together with the 
position the Continental troops have taken, in my 
opinion leaves us little to fear, at present, from the 
machinations of any Spanish party. 
</p><p>
That God may bless and preserve you, and that 
the United States may long continue to enjoy the 
happiness of your government and protection, is the 
most fervent prayer of one, -who has the honor to 
be, with the most respectful esteem and sincerity, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
