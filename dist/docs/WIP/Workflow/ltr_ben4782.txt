DEAR POLLY, 
</p><p>
I received your Letter early this Morning; and, as I am 
so engaged, that I cannot see you when you come to-day, I 
write this Line just to say, that I am sure you are a much 
better Judge in this Affair of your own, than I can possibly 
be. 2 In that Confidence it was, that I forebore giving my 
Advice when you mention'd it to me, and not from any Disapprobation. My Concern (equal to any Father's) for your 
Happiness makes me write this, lest, having more Regard for 
my Opinion than you ought, and imagining it against the 
Proposal because I did not immediately advise accepting 
it, you should let that weigh any thing in your Deliberations. 
</p><p>
I assure you, that no Objection has occur'd to me. His 
Person you see ; his Temper and his Understanding you can 
judge of; his Character, for any thing I have ever heard, is 
unblemished; his Profession, with the Skill in it he is suppos'd to have, will be sufficient to support a Family; and, 
therefore, considering the Fortune you have in your Hands 
(tho' any future Expectation from your Aunt should be disappointed), I do not see but that the Agreement may be a 
rational one on both sides. 
</p><p>
I see your Delicacy, and your Humility too ; for you fancy 
that if you do not prove a great Fortune, you will not be 
lov'd; but I am sure that were I in his situation in every 
respect, knowing you so well as I do, and esteeming you so 
highly, I should think you a Fortune sufficient for me without 
a Shilling. 
</p><p>
Having thus, more explicitly than before, given my Opinion, 
I leave the rest to your sound Judgment, of which no one has 
a greater Share ; and I shall not be too inquisitive after your 
particular Reasons, your Doubts, your Fears, etc. For I 
shall be confident, whether you accept or refuse, that you do 
right. I only wish you may do what will most contribute to 
your Happiness, and of course to mine ; being ever, my dear 
Friend, yours most affectionately, B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. Don't be angry with me for supposing your Determination not quite so fix'd as you fancy it. 
</p>
