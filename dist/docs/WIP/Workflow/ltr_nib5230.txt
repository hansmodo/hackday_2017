Dear Sir 
</p><p>
The annexed list has been sent to me from Washington, as containing the views of several members of Congress 
from Kentucky in regard to a proper direction for your Office. 
It is accompanied by an expression of opinion on their part not to me directly, but thro a common friend that during 
the elections in Kentucky, great facilities were given by the Branches in that State, to persons favorable to the reelection 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a>, whilst almost all accommodation was withheld 
from the other side of the contest. I will not believe for a moment that this is not a mistake. The officers of the Bank have 
hitherto so studiously avoided all interference in politics, 
that I think it scarcely possible that any gentlemen connected with it, should so far forget their duty as to become 
partizans, or abuse their delicate trusts to the unworthy purpose of advancing any political object. The statement is how 
ever made, and the nomination subjoined is I presume in tended to prevent the recurrence of similar favoritism in 
future by an union of parties in the Board. As you are about to forward a new list, I will state to you precisely my views on that subject. 
</p><p>
Politics should be rigorously excluded from the administration of the Bank. In selecting Directors, the first considerations [should be] integrity, independence, &amp; knowledge of 
business. No man should be shunned, &amp; no man should be 
sought on account of his political opinions merely. Nevertheless in a community where broad political divisions prevail, 
we must not be wholly insensible to them we must not 
exclude, nor even seem to exclude, any one particular denomination of politicians; but where both present candidates of 
equal merits, we should take them from both parties. But 
still the first question is, their qualifications, distinct from 
their political opinions. I would not however be disposed to 
act on any regular system of equally uniting both parties 
because the inevitable effect of it would be to force upon us 
inferior men, merely because they were politicians. I have 
myself an extreme unwillingness to blend politics with the 
concerns of the Bank. Nearly all its misfortunes may be 
traced to this cause, &amp; in your section of the country we 
have surely had a melancholy experience of the hazard of 
lending to politicians. Since you have been relieved from 
them, your affairs have prospered, and you are doing so 
well that I do not wish to disturb your progress by an infusion of politics. But at the same time, we must avoid the 
odium, which would naturally &amp; justly attach to the exclusion of any party from its proper share in the government 
&amp; the loans of the Bank. . . .
