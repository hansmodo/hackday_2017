SIR: 
</p><p>
I have written to you by Major Conyers respecting Mahanrs corps; 
also, what must be done with those persons who come out of Charlestown. Since the time specified in ruy invitation, the refugees have 
obtained permission to remain until the 26th inst. I proposed a plan 
to Col. Lushington, some time ago, for manning the galley at George 
town ; I have not since heard from him on the subject. If that plan 
does not take, I know of no other at present; for, as I have before 
observed to you, I have no money, nor have I the means of commanding any. It would be a mere trifle for the merchants and inhabitants 
in and about that place, to advance as much money, or something else, 
as would fit out the vessel, and they are the most immediately interested 
in it. A few years ago, the public spirit of our people would have stimulated them to do such a thing without being asked; but, alas! that 
seems now to be vanished. Mrs. Matthews is now on her way from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and I expect she will be at the high hills of Santee about 
the 7th of next month; and, as the road from Laurens Ferry to this 
place is very dangerous^ I must desire an escort might be sent to meet 
her at the ferry, and conduct her down to my quarters. Let the escort 
be at Laurens by the 7th, and send on one of the men to Capt. Richardson's, to wait there until she arrives (if she should not be there 
before) that she might know the escort waits for her; otherwise, she 
may stay there a day or two, and I don t want the men to be absent 
longer than necessity requires. You are a better judge than I am what 
number of horse will be sufficient to render her passage safe ; therefore, 
I shall leave the appointment of the party to you. I think it would be 
well to caution the person who is to command the party, not to say for 
what purpose they are ordered, lest some villains might be tempted to 
waylay the road before she gets to the ferry, for she has only one white 
man and two negro servants with her, and Capt. Richardson informs 
me there are some bad men in that neighborhood, who have lately plundered several people. If it would not be fatiguing the horses too much, 
or attended with particular inconvenience, I would be glad they could 
be sent as far as Capt. Richardson s, to meet her. However, I shall 
leave the matter to you, as I dare say you will be disposed to accommodate her as far as the service will admit. Yours, &c.,
