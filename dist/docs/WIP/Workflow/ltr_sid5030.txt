Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Captain Landais is the bearer of this. He goes in the Heureuse, loaded with stores for America. This cargo 
has, by a succession of obstacles thrown in the way, been delayed from January last, to a most prodigious cost and 
expense. I hope, however, that it may finally arrive in season to be of essential service. Captain Landais, whom 
I have mentioned in my former letters, will offer his service to the United States. I must repeat here what I 
have written before, that I find him to be a skilful seaman, of long experience in every part of the world, of good 
judgment, and of the most unsuspicious honor and probity ; I can but consider him as a valuable acquisition to our navy.

My agreement with M. Monthieu, the owner of this ship, in case she should not be sold in America, is that she be 
despatched with a cargo of tobacco as soon as possible, if the article is to he had, if not, with such articles as can be 
procured, as I have engaged for the freight out and home, and you are sensible of the necessity of having remittances 
by every opportunity. Whatever this ship may be loaded with, I pray the cargo may come to Messrs Rodrique Hortalez & Co. as they have advanced for the arms and other articles of this cargo, over and above their other large 
advances. Tobacco is the best article at present, in the ports of France, or indeed in any part of Europe, and must 
continue so for a very considerable time yet to come, most probably for twelve months. You will please to send me 
an account of the cargo, whatever it may be, that you ship in this vessel, and duplicates by others. 
I have the honor to be, Sec.
