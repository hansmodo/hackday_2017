Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In one of your former letters you intimate, that a free 
communication of sentiments will not be displeasing to you. 
If, under this sanction, I should step beyond the line you would wish to draw, and suggest ideas or ask questions 
which are improper to be answered, you hare only to pass them by in silence. I wish you to be convinced that I do 
not desire to pry into measures the knowledge of which is not necessary for my government as an executive officer, or the premature discovery of which might be prejudicial to plans in contemplation. 
</p><p>
After premising this. I beg leave to ask what are the 
reasons for keeping the continental frigates in port? If it 
is because hands cannot be obtained to man them on 
the present encouragement, some other plan ought to be 
adopted to make them useful. Had not Congress better 
lend them to commanders of known bravery and capacity 
for a limited term, at the expiration of which the vessels, if 
not taken or lost, to revert to the Statesâ€” they and their 
crews, in the mean time, enjoying the exclusive benefit of 
all captures they make, but acting either .singly or conjointly under the direction of Congress ? If this or a similar 
plan could be fallen upon, comprehending the whole number, under some common head, a man of ability and 
authority commissioned to act as commodore or admiral, 
I think great advantages might result from it. I am not 
sure but at this moment, by such a collection of the naval 
force we have, all the British armed vessels and transports 
at Georgia might be taken or destroyed, and their troops 
ruined. Upon the present system, our ships are not only 
very expensive and totally useless in port, but sometimes 
require a land force to protect them, as happened lately at 
New-London. 
</p><p>
The rumour of the camp is, that Monsieur Gerard is about 
to return to France ; some speak confidently of its taking 
place. If this be a fact, the motives doubtless an > powerful ; 
as it would open a wide field for speculation, and give our 
enemies, whether with or without real cause, at least a 
handle for misrepresentation and triumph. 
</p><p>
Will Congress suffer the Bermudian vessels, which are to have arrived at Delaware and Chesapeake Bays, to 
exchange their salt for Hour, as is reported to be their intention ? Will they not .rather order them to depart immediately? Indulging them with a supply of provisions at 
this time will be injurious to us in two respects: it will deprive us of what we really stand in need of for ourselves, 
and will contribute to the support of that swarm of privateers which resort to Bermuda, from whence they infest our coast, and, in a manner, annihilate our trade. Besides these 
considerations, by withholding a supply, we throw many 
additional months upon the enemy's magazines, and increase proportionally their distress. They will not and cannot let their people starve. 
</p><p>
In the last place, though first in importance, I shall ask, is there any thing doing, or that can be done, to restore the 
credit of our currency '. The depreciation of it is got to so alarming a point that a wagon-load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon-load of provisions. 
</p><p>
I repeat what I before 'ved, that I do not wish for 
</p><p>
your reply to more of these matters than you can touch with strict propriety. 
</p><p>
Very truly I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and affectionate servant,
