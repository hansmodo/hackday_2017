SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 5th instant was 
duly received, and, though it was and is the universal opinion, that the number of men under <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> is greater than can be fed, when he proceeds a little further on the expedition, yet we gave 
early and peremptory orders to the companies of 
rangers to join him, as soon as they were completed 
to any tolerable number. We also directed the militia of the adjoining counties to give all possible aid, 
as we were resolved that, should the expedition fail 
of success, no imputation should justly fall upon the 
State of Pennsylvania, Our prospects of raising these 
men were very flattering, the success in recruiting, 
for a little time, having equalled, or rather exceeded, 
our expectations ; but the Quarter-master's department having occasion for a number of bateau-men, 
and offering forty-five pounds per month, and a ration 
and a half per day, were terms so superior to what 
we had to offer, that the service has languished ever 
since, and it is very doubtful whether they will, or 
can be completed. 
</p><p>
It is a general opinion, that the boatmen might 
have been procured upon more favorable terms ; but, 
as it was a necessary service, and well meant, we 
can only wish better information had been had. 
Every State and country is limited in its powers, 
and if its resources are drawn off in one service, 
they cannot be had in another. Five hundred are engaged in this boat service, all of this State, besides 
which, the deputies, assistants, and helpers, amount 
to a great number. "We would not infer from this 
that they are unnecessary, but to account for the deficiencies of these companies, which otherwise would 
have been very complete. 
</p><p>
We beg leave to refer your Excellency to the in 
closed letter, which will show that no orders have 
been wanting on our part, and that there is every 
disposition in the officers under us to execute them, 
as far as they can. 
</p><p>
It is much to be wished that, instead of troubling 
your Excellency with this circuitous mode of application, <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> would address himself directly 
to us. We have assured him that we will endeavour to give him every aid and assistance in our power, 
and, when it cannot be done, we shall, at least, be 
able to give him sufficient reasons. We have not 
had a line from him since he left Easton; and, though 
we know from other advices that these companies 
had not joined, we had not any information on the 
subject from the General himself. 
</p><p>
We are very sensible, Sir, that this expedition has 
received all possible aid from you. It has also been 
fostered and cherished by this State. We have drawn 
off our wagons at four pounds ten shillings per day, 
which will not pay the drivers and shoe the horses. 
We have stopped a great number of ploughs. The 
encouragement of one hundred dollars, by Congress, 
was so small, that the State added shoes, shirts, leggings, blankets, and arms, amounting to triple the sum. 
Our orders and measures since, would show your Excellency our anxiety on the subject in so striking a 
view as to exclude any supposition that any thing 
is omitted, in our power, to procure the desired sucss. But we cannot change the course of things 
and order of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, to advance <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>'s views, be they ever so apparently salutary ; and 
we hope his recollection of past periods, wherein ho 
has seen you rise superior to disappointments and 
deficiencies far more important, will strengthen his 
mind to obviate those which may occur to him. With 
perfect esteem and respect, I have the honor to be, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
