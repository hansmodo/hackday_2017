DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Favour of March 5, by M. Dazeux, and 
shall be glad of any opportunity of doing him Service. It gave 
me great Pleasure to learn by him, that you are well & happily married, on which I give you Joy. J Tis after all the most 
natural State of Man. 
</p><p>
Mr. West, our President, concerning whom you make 
enquiry, is esteemed a good Antiquarian, but has not distinguish'd himself in any other Branch of Science. He is a 
Member of Parliament, was formerly Secretary to the Treasury, and is very rich. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear that a Voyage is intended from France 
to the North Pole. The World owes much to the noble 
Spirit with which your Nation pursues the Improvement 
of Knowledge, and to the Liberality with which you communicate what you acquire to the rest of Mankind. I hope 
your Philosophers on that Voyage will be able to discover 
more clearly the Cause of the Aurora Borealis, and a Passage 
round the North of America. 
</p><p>
I suppose Care has been taken to make their Ships very 
strong, that they may bear thumping among the Ice. My 
best Wishes will attend them for their Success and Safe Return. 
</p><p>
Messrs. Banks and Solander are to sail with two Ships 
in about a Fortnight for the South. They expect to be out 
near 4 Years. They present their Compliments, & are 
pleas'd with the Notice you honour them with in your Letter 
to me. Sir John Pringle continues well and presents his 
respectful compliments to you. I am, with the most perfect 
</p><p>
Esteem, 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, yours, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
