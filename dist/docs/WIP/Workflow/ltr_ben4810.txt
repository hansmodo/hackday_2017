Being greatly hurried in preparing for my Journey, I have 
barely had time to write the enclos'd. I cannot find M. 
Allemand's Paper : But you will meet with no Difficulty 
in Holland. A good general Rule in travelling foreign Countries, is, to avoid as much as possible all Disputes, & to be 
contented with such Provisions and Cookery, as you meet 
with in the Inns, so you will have the best the Country affords 
in the Season, which you cannot know so as to direct, and if 
you attempt to direct the Cookery they will not understand 
or be able to follow your Orders, & whatever Difficulties you 
put them to they will be sure to charge you extravagantly 
for, particularly in Holland. I inclose a Card of the House 
at which I lodg'd in Paris. It is a good one, that I can recommend to you. If full, Mrs. Mean, the Landlady, will 
advise you in the Choice of another. Wishing you & your 
Companion a good Journey & happy Return to your Friends, 
</p><p>
I am, Sir 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble Servant.

B. FRANKLIN.

M. Dessin at the Hotel D'Angleterre at Calais, will advise 
you about your Journey, Baggage &c. His is a good House, 
& I recommend it to you as your Inn, when there.
