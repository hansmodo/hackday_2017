Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am pleased to hear so flattering accounts of the 
prospects of obtaining men and some kinds of supplies ; but so great are my apprehensions, on the score 
of provisions, that I am sending <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='co-worker'>General Heath</a> purposely to the eastern States to represent our distresses, and to endeavour to fix a plan for our regular 
supply in future. I refer you to him for particulars, 
which I do not choose to trust to paper. After <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='co-worker'>General Heath</a> has finished this business, his private affairs will detain him some time at home ; and, as he 
will be able at the same time to attend to what you have at present in charge, you may, upon his return 
from New Hampshire to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, come to the army. 
You will have my warmest thanks for the zeal, with 
which you have promoted and forwarded every measure tending to the good of the service. I am, &c. 
</p>
