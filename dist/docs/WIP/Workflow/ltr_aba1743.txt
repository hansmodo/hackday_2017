MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR favor of December 9th, came to hand this evening from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. By the same post I received a letter from <a href="/results.php?tla=jal" rel="acquaintance">Mr. Lovell</a>, transcribing some 
passages from one of the same date to him, and the only one, he says, which he has received since your absence, and his pocket book proves, that he has 
written eighteen different times ; yet possibly you may have received as few from him. The watery world alone can boast of large packets received ; a 
discouraging thought when I take my pen. Yet I will not be discouraged. I will persist in writing, 
though but one in ten should reach you. I have been impatient for an opportunity, none having offered since January, when the Alliance sailed, which, my presaging mind assures me, will arrive safe in France, and I hope will return as safely. 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the care you take of me, in so kindly providing for me the articles you mention. 
Should they arrive safe, they will be a great assistance to me. The safest way, you tell me, of sup 
plying my wants, is by drafts ; but I cannot get hard money for bills. You had as good tell me to pro 
cure diamonds for them ; and, when bills will fetch but five for one, hard money will exchange ten, 
which I think is very provoking ; and I must give at the rate of ten, and sometimes twenty, for one, for 
every article I purchase. I blush whilst I give you a price current ; all butcher's meat from a dollar to 
eight shillings per pound ; corn twenty-five dollars, rye thirty, per bushel ; flour fifty pounds per hundred ; potatoes ten dollars per bushel ; butter twelve shillings a pound, cheese eight ; sugar twelve shillings a pound ; molasses twelve dollars per gallon ; 
labor six and eight dollars a day ; a common cow, from sixty to seventy pounds ; and all English goods 
in proportion. This is our present situation. It is a risk to send me any thing across the water, I know ; 
yet, if one in three arrives, I should be a gainer. I have studied, and do study, every method of economy 
in my power ; otherwise a mint of money would not support a family. I could not board our two sons under 
forty dollars per week apiece at a school. I therefore thought it most prudent to request Mr. Thaxter to look after them, giving him his board and the use 
of the office, which he readily accepted, and, having passed the winter with me, will continue through the summer, as I see no probability of the times speedily growing better. 
</p><p>
We have had much talk of peace through the mediation of Spain, and great news from Spain, and a thousand reports, as various as the persons who 
tell them ; yet I believe slowly, and rely more upon the information of my friend, than on all the whole legion of stories which rise with the sun, and set as 
soon. Respecting Georgia, other friends have written you. I shall add nothing of my own, but that 
I believe it will finally be a fortunate event to us. 
</p><p>
Our vessels have been fortunate in making prizes, though many were taken in the fall of the year. We 
have been greatly distressed for [want of] grain. I scarcely know the looks or taste of biscuit or flour 
for this four months ; yet thousands have been much worse off, having no grain of any sort. 
</p><p>
The great commotion raised here by <a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="">Mr. Deane</a> has sunk into contempt for his character ; and it 
would be better for him to leave a country, which is now supposed to have been injured by him. His friends are silent, not knowing how to extricate him. 
</p><p>
It would be happy for him, if he had the art himself. He most certainly had art enough, in the beginning, 
to blow up a flame, and to set the whole continent in agitation. 
</p><p>
23 April.

More than a month has passed away since writing the above, and no opportunity has yet offered of conveying you a line ; next to the pain of not receiving, 
is that of not being able to send a token of remembrance and affection. (You must excuse my not copying, as paper is ten dollars per quire.) Last week a packet arrived from Brest, with despatches for Congress, but no private letters. I was disappointed, but 
did not complain. You would have written, I know, had you supposed she was coming to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. By 
her we heard of the safe arrival of the Alliance in France, which gave me much pleasure. May she have as safe a return to us again. Last week, arrived here the frigate Warren, after a successful cruise. She had been out about six weeks, in company with the Queen of France, and the Ranger, 
Captain Jones. They fell in with, and captured, a fleet, bound from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> to Georgia, consisting 
of ship Jason, twenty guns, and one hundred and fifty men ; ship Maria, sixteen guns, eighty-four 
men, having on board eighteen hundred barrels of flour ; privateer schooner Hibernian, eight guns, 
and forty-five men ; brigs Patriot, Prince Frederick, Bachelor John, and schooner Chance ; all of which are safe arrived, to the universal joy and satisfaction 
of every well-wisher of his country. The officers who were captured, acknowledge that this loss will 
be severely felt by the enemy, and it is hoped that it will give General Lincoln important advantages over him in Georgia. 
</p><p>
Respecting domestic affairs, I shall do tolerably, whilst my credit is well supported abroad ; and my 
demands there shall be as small as possible, considering the state of things here ; but I cannot purchase 
a bushel of grain under three hard dollars, though the scarcity of that article makes it dearer than other things. 
</p><p>
My pen is really so bad that I cannot add any further, than that I am wholly 
</p><p>
Yours.
