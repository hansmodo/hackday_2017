SIR, 
</p><p>
The desire of communicating speedily with your Excellency determines me to make a debarkation on 
the coast of Jersey, in a village which, according to 
the map, is to the northward of the river Shrewsbury. 
If our common enemy are in possession, and can be 
driven from it, I shall fulfil the object of my descent. 
An instant of liberty will suffice for a good patriot 
to show himself. Every citizen will be eager to convey my homage to the Deliverer of his country. The 
first moments are so precious, above all upon sea, 
that it may be of the greatest importance for me 
to be informed, four-and-twenty hours sooner or later, 
of the projects of your Excellency. I have orders to 
second them. I dare assure you that I will do it to 
the utmost of my power. To act in concert with a 
great man is the first of blessings; it is one of those 
which flatter me the most in the commission with 
which I am honored. An apprehension that the letter, of which I have now the honor to send a duplicate, may not come to hand till late, makes me ha 
rd a step, the motive for which must be the excuse. 
I have the honor to be,
