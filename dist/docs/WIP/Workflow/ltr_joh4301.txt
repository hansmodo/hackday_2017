Sir, 
</p><p>
Having received information that you intended to 
honor this State with a visit, and wishing personally 
to show you every mark of attention which the most 
sincere friendship can induce, I beg the favor of your 
making my house the place of your residence while 
you shall remain in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I could wish that the 
accommodations were better suited to a gentleman of 
your respectability; but you may be assured that 
nothing on my part shall be wanting to render them 
as agreeable as possible. 
</p><p>
As Governor of the Commonwealth, I feel it to be 
my duty to receive your visit with such tokens of 
respect as may answer the expectations of my constituents, and may in some measure express the high 
sentiments of respect they feel towards you. I have 
therefore issued orders for proper escorts to attend 
you ; and Colonel Hall, Deputy Adjutant-General, will 
wait upon you at Worcester, and will inform you of 
the disposition I have made of the troops at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, under the command of General Brooks, and 
request that you would be so obliging as to pass 
that way to the town, where you will receive such 
other tokens of respect from the people, as will serve 
further to evince how gratefully they recollect your 
exertions for their liberties, and their confidence in 
you as President of the United States of America. 
</p><p>
The gentlemen of the Council will receive you at 
<a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and attend you to town. I should be 
obliged to you, on the return of this express, to let 
me know when you propose to be in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and as 
near as you can the time of the day. I have the 
honor to be, with every sentiment of esteem and respect. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">John Hancock</a>.
