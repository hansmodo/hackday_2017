My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the twenty- second of June, and am 
in the hourly hope to hear farther from you. I need not tell 
you that it will give me pleasure. Enclosed you will find the 
copy of a letter, which I wrote to Mr Jefferson on the 7th of 
November, <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>. This, with some other communications at 
the same epoch, he never acknowledged. I know not why, 
but I think the paper enclosed in that letter will be agreeable 
to you, though not very amusing.

It would seem that your friend Scipio is not much attached 
to Paulusj at least if I may judge from some things which I see. 
However, there is a great chasm in my newspapers, which 
breaks the thread of my conjectures, as well as of my information ; for I have little, I might almost say, none of the latter but 
from the gazettes ; of course I know what passes about two 
months after everybody else. Tell me, I pray you, how Sccevola stands affected between the parties just named. I think 
he never had a very high opinion of the first mentioned, but he 
was attached to Tarquin immeasurably, and that, with some 
local circumstances, may have formed a stronger chain than I 
should otherwise suppose.

You will have seen that the late constitution of this country 
has overset ; a natural accident to a thing, which was all sail and 
no ballast. I desire much, very much, to know the state of 
opinions with you on that subject. Some gentlemen, who con 
sidered it as the acme of human wisdom, must, I suppose, find 
out causes which persons on the spot never dreamt of. But 
in seeking or inventing these causes, what will be their opinion 
of present powers, what the conduct they wish to pursue ? 
These are to me important questions. Brutus will doubtless 
triumph, but I wish to feel the pulse of opinion with you, or 
rather to know beforehand how it is like to beat. There are 
pros and cons, whose action I cannot estimate. The flight of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, the murder of the Duke de laRochefoucault and others, with many similar circumstances, have, I 
know, affected the ideas of some. But what will be the repub 
lican sense as to the new republic ? Will it be taken for grant 
ed, that Louis the Sixteenth was guilty of all possible crimes, 
and particularly of the enormous one of not suffering his throat 
to be cut, which was certainly a nefarious plot against the peo 
ple, and a manifest violation of the bill of rights ? Paulus, who 
is no enemy to Kings, will not believe that-they are all tigers ; 
but I am not certain that, if he were here, he would not con 
sider them as monkeys.

However, we are done with them in France, at least for the 
present. There are two parties here. The one consists of 
about half a dozen, and the other of fifteen or twenty, who are 
at dagger's drawing. Each claims the merit of having made 
the young republic. My public letters and the gazettes will 
bring you acquainted with things here, as fully as I can in any 
way communicate them. It is not worth while to detail the 
characters of those now on the stage, because they must soon 
give place to others. Adieu.
