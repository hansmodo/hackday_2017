Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr Short, just before he departed from this city, left with 
me a Memoir in Dutch, respecting the mint. I was to get it 
translated for you, but not not having been able to find a per 
son acquainted with the Dutch and English languages, I have 
now determined to send you the original, which you will find 
here enclosed. I hope it may prove useful, and answer the end 
you had in view. I have transmitted to Mr Jefferson copies 
of my correspondence with the Commisioners of the Treasury 
here, respecting our debt. You seem to have supposed, that 
the instalments due had been paid, and this may turn out to 
be the case, when the account shall have been strictly exam 
ined, which I shall take care of. Mr Short left (as I presume 
he informed you,) this business unfinished, supposing that my 
powers would be competent to it, which they are not; and in 
deed I should be glad to avoid all interference in pecuniary af 
fairs, if possible. Not on account of the labor, for you may lay 
as much of that on me as you please, but I would avoid all occasions of slanderous imputation. 
</p><p>
I formerly recommended to Mr Short the opening of a loan 
at Antwerp, and it was attended with the best effects ; for the 
capitalists of Amsterdam, who had shortly before induced our 
Commissioners to believe that money could not be obtained 
there under five per cent, soon after let us have it at four. This 
1 was sure would happen, for I had been in Holland, had studied the character of the money lending people, and made my 
self acquainted with the manner of transacting business. 
</p><p>
I am still of opinion, that it is wise to multiply the scenes on 
which to display our credit. Those, who have lent money to a 
nation, naturally incline to speak well of that nation, first to justify the confidence they have placed, and next to increase the 
value of the stock they possess. It may at first seem more eligible, because more convenient, to perform all our pecuniary 
operations at one place, and those, who are interested in establishing that dcctrine, will find many plausible arguments in sup 
port of their favorite theory, just as somebody (I believe it was Silas Deane) endeavored to prove, that we had better buy teas 
and nankins in London than in China. I remember the thing 
made an impression on me at the time, as the India Company 
were then buying at Dunkirk some teas, which had been shipped from America. 
</p><p>
To return from the digression, I apprehend that confining 
this business to one spot, may in the end have a very unfavor 
able influence both on our commerce and exchange, because 
the necessity of remittances being known, and the periods also, 
capitalists can take their measures beforehand to give you the 
law. And if, which God forbid, public events should compel 
us to make loans, our creditors knowing our absolute dependence on them alone, will impose whatever terms they please. 
I do not dwell on these topics, because a word is sufficient to 
you.
