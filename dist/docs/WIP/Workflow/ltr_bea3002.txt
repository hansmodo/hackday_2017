DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote you the 14th ultimo, of our situation and 
prospects, since which nothing of consequence has occurred here. The enemy, to the number of about 
five hundred, have twice sallied out at Palace Gate, 
with design of seizing our field-pieces (near the 
Nunnery) ; but, on our troops advancing to attack 
them, they made a precipitate retreat under cover of 
their guns. Desertions from the garrison are frequent, by which we learn they are much distressed 
for fuel, and must soon burn their houses and ships. 
Two officers, taken at St. John s, were lately sent 
with a flag to the walls, with a view of getting their 
families at liberty, but were refused admittance, 
which, I am told by several deserters, incensed the 
inhabitants very much, and caused a great uneasiness 
in the garrison, who, I believe begin to grow heartily 
tired of salt provisions and confinement. We have 
received a reinforcement of four hundred men; many 
are daily coming in. I hope, in the course of this 
month, we shall have four or five thousand men. I am fearful we shall not be supplied with shot, shells, 
mortars, &c. I am therefore preparing ladders for an 
assault, if necessary. The extensiveness of the works 
I think will render their defence impracticable. 
</p><p>
I have this minute the pleasure of your favor of 
the 27th ultimo. I am greatly obliged to you for 
your good wishes, and the concern you express for 
me. Sensible of the vast importance of this country, 
you may be assured my utmost exertions will not be 
wanting to effect your wishes in adding it to the 
United Colonies. I am fully of your opinion, that 
the balance will turn in whose favor it belongs. The 
repeated successes of our raw, undisciplined troops 
over the flower of the British army, the many unexpected and remarkable occurrences in our favor, are 
plain proofs of the overruling hand of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, 
and justly demand our warmest gratitude to Heaven, 
which I make no doubt will crown our virtuous 
efforts with success. No doubt Administration will 
exert themselves in sending a large force this way 
in the spring ; but if we are fortunate enough to 
reduce the city before they arrive, I make no doubt 
of keeping it, as we shall have the interest of the 
country in general, to which the raising two regiments of Canadians (which Congress have ordered) 
will not a little conduce. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to inform you, notwithstanding every 
precaution that could be used, the smallpox has 
crept in among the troops. We have near one hundred men in the hospital. In general it is favorable; 
very few have died. I have moved the inhabitants 
of the vicinity of Quebec into the country, and hope 
to prevent its spreading any further. 
</p><p>
The severity of the climate, the troops very illy 
clad, and worse paid, the trouble of reconciling matters among the inhabitants, and lately an uneasiness 
amonc; the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and some other officers, who think themselves neglected in the new arrangement, while those who deserted the cause and went home 
last fall have been promoted ; in short, the choice of difficulties I have had to encounter, has rendered it so very perplexing, that I have often been at a loss 
how to conduct matters. 
</p><p>
As <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>'s ill state of health will not permit his coming this way, I was in hopes General Lee, or some experienced officer, would have been 
sent to take the command here. The service requires a person of greater abilities and experience than I can pretend to. <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a> writes me his intention of coming down here. I am afraid he will not be able to leave <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you my wound is 
entirely healed, and I am able to hobble about my 
room. Though my leg is a little contracted and weak, 
I hope soon to be fit for action. We are waiting 
impatiently, expecting to hear of some capital blow 
being struck with you. I beg my compliments to 
the gentlemen of your family; and am, with great 
respect and esteem, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
