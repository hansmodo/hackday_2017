My dear Sir 
</p><p>
It occurs to me that the present is a crisis for <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>, &amp; for the Bank. The Penn a delegation, and eminently Mr Dallas, now have an opportunity of doing great 
good; and of acquiring great distinction. Let them go for ward, and mediate between the President and the Bank, 
make him name his modifications; make the Bank agree to them, make the re-charter an administration measure. 
You see at a glance all this. Do put them up to it; make Mr. Livingston and Mr. McLane stir in it. It is a real coup d etat. Try if you cannot bring it about, without loss of time.
