...  You tell me you embraced the opportunity by Mr. Goodhue to write to me, though you had nothing new to 
acquaint me with ; and yet you filled up nearly three pages. 
I often begin to write to you without a single idea in ad 
vance; but my love, ever faithful and alive, suggests at all 
times some things which I conceive you wish to hear besides 
the news of the day, which to me arc always the dullest part 
of my letters. I am always happiest when I am adverting 
to our mutual love and esteem, and to those circumstances 
which particularly respect ourselves and our little son. I 
often contemplate (and it has been my principal enjoyment) 
the bliss we shall feel on our next joyful meeting, though I 
repine deeply that it is probably at such a distance. . . . 
I think on your peculiar state, without father, mother, 
brother, or sister, and wish the more to be ever present 
with you, that in the care, protection, and love of a husband, you may find all these wants more than supplied. I 
am indeed happier than most men would be ; for, though 
you are destitute of, yet I am blessed with, all those dear 
relatives ; and such affection unites the family, that, even in 
my absence, you must experience from my parents, brothers, 
and sisters all the fruits of parental and fraternal love. I 
am deceived if you do not find in them all the kindness 
which is generally to be expected from kindred blood. . . . 
I remember now you have mentioned their kindness, particularly brother Gardner's, who has been at home, has had 
it in his power, and has laid himself out, to oblige you. He 
is a kind-hearted man as lives ; and tears of gratitude this 
moment fill my eyes for the substantial, friendly offices he 
has done you. My sister Gardner, too, with the strictest 
economy, is most obligingly generous. . . . 
The army is come to its ground, and this day we begin 
to hut. . . .
