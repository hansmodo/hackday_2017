Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter which your Excellency 
did me the honor to write on the 23d of the past 
month, and that of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, with 
which it was accompanied. 
I wait with extreme impatience the news of the 
arrival of the French division before <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; and 
no one can desire more warmly than I do to see it 
under your immediate command. I hoped most fervently that you would have been this spring in the 
command of a more considerable body of auxiliaries. 
The causes which have hindered the execution of 
that plan have been so urgent and so decisive, that I 
am sure you will approve them, after I shall have 
had the honor of making you acquainted with them. 
I have nevertheless been much pained that I could 
not explain to you this change of measures; and my 
attachment to the cause which you defend has made 
me feel, as sensibly as any citizen of America, all the 
delays which could happen to the assistance which we 
wish to give to the thirteen States. 
</p><p>
I am impressed with the necessity of maintaining 
a perfect confidence with your Excellency upon these 
different points, and I shall seize the first occasion 
which presents itself to visit your army. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, I am going to transmit to the 
Count de Grasse what your Excellency did me the 
honor to communicate. Be persuaded that I shall 
use the most pressing motives to determine him, and 
I shall do it with so much the more zeal, as I feel 
the necessity of it. I shall transmit to that General an extract of your letter; and nothing appears to me 
more likely to give weight to the demand which I 
shall make from him. 
</p><p>
The King has charged me, Sir, to inform Congress, 
that he grants them a gratuitous subsidy, to enable 
them to make the greatest efforts in the course of 
this campaign. This subsidy, amounting to six millions of livres tournois, is to be employed in the 
purchase of arms, ammunition, and clothing ; and it is the intention of the King, that the surplus shall he 
at the disposal of Congress. I have not been instructed, as to what will be the exact amount of this 
surplus; but in the mean time it is determined that 
one million and a half shall be employed by the Superintendent of Finances of the thirteen States, according to the directions which you shall give him, 
and after the arrangements which you shall make 
with him in the visit which he intends making you. 
I have informed Congress, and I intrust it to your 
Excellency, that the Emperor and the Empress of 
Russia have offered their mediation to the Court of 
London, which has accepted it. It has also been offered to the Court of Versailles and that of Madrid. 
But they have given for answer, that time must be 
left to Congress to determine, if it suits them to put 
the interests of the thirteen States into the hands of 
the Mediators. In any event, it is of the greatest 
importance that the allies make all their efforts to 
drive the enemy from This Continent; and nothing will 
be more likely than the success of the confederate 
arms, to make a successful negotiation. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
