DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was in Ireland when your respected Fav of July 8. 
arrived at my House here. On my Return which was just 
before the Meeting of Parliam' I by a Line or two acknowledg'd the Receipt of it, intending to write more largely as 
soon as any Business should occur. I hoped the Petition 
relating to the controverted Lands would have been brought 
forward long before this time, having been assured when it 
was presented that it should in its Turn come under Consideration ; but such has been the Croud of more important 
Affairs, that the Council have as yet found no time to do any 
thing in it. Tho' I flatter my self, as no solicitation is omitted, 
that it may be brought to a favourable Conclusion before the 
Season of Business is over. 
</p><p>
Your Account of the Governor's Treatment of the Assembly & your self, determined me to wait upon him on his 
Arrival here, as we can not but greatly disapprove his Conduct. As your Mode of appointing an Agent is by an Ordinance to which he must give his Assent I think it not likely 
that I shall be continued in that Service for your Province. 
I shall nevertheless continue to render it every Good Office 
in my power while I remain in England, which I think will 
not now be much longer.

The presenting of a Speaker to the King I suppose was 
originally intended that the King might know the Person 
from whom he was to receive the Sense of Parliament on 
every proper Occasion. To facilitate the Intercourse, it is 
probable the Parliament might think it advisable rather to 
chuse (other Qualifications being equal) a Person not justly 
obnoxious to the King; and then it was natural for him to 
compliment them by saying he approv'd their Choice. But 
from this it by no means follows, that without such Approbation the Speaker could not continue in his Office, or that if 
the House refus'd to chuse another, it would be a justifiable 
Use of the Prerogative therefore to dissolve them. I believe 
a King of England at this Day would hardly venture on such 
a Step; but Governors take greater Liberties, having naturally no Respect for the People, but abundance for Ministers. It is by the Arbitrary Proceedings of Governors & other 
Crown Officers countenanced by their Protectors here, that 
the Affections of the Americans to this Country are daily 
diminishing, and their Attachment to its Government in 
danger of being lost in the Course of a few succeeding Years. 
As a Disunion would be a Weakening to the Empire, & of 
course prejudicial to [remainder of letter lost]
