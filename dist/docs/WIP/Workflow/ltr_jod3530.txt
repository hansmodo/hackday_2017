MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have had an escape again ; J but are arrived safely in Spain. As the frigate will probably not get 
from this place these two months, I must go by land 
to Paris, which I suppose is a journey of between 
three and four hundred leagues. That part of it which is in Spain is very mountainous. No post, bad 
roads, bad taverns, and very dear. We must ride mules, 
horses not being to be had. I must get some kind 
of carriage for the children, if possible. They are 
very well. Charles has sustained the voyage and 
behaves as well as ever his brother did. He is much 
pleased with what he sees. Sammy Cooper, too, is 
very well. These young gentlemen give me a vast 
deal of trouble in this unexpected journey. I have 
bought a dictionary and grammar, and they are learning the Spanish language as fast as possible. What 
could we do, if you and all the family were with 
me ?

<a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a> is a magnificent port and harbor. It is fortified by nature, by rows of lofty rocky mountains on 
each side the narrow entrance of it, and the public 
works, the fortifications, barracks, arsenals, &c., 
which are of stone very like <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> stone, exceed any thing I have seen. I dined the day before yesterday with Don Joseph Saint Vincent, the Lieutenant General of the Marine, who is the commandant of this 
port, with four and twenty French and Spanish officers. 
The difference between gravity and gaiety was an amusing speculation. Yesterday, I dined on board the Triomphant, an eighty-gun French ship, commanded by 
the Chef d Escadre, M. Sade, and have engagements 
for every day for a much longer time than I shall 
stay. The French consul and vice consul have been 
particularly polite and obliging to me. In short, I 
never was better pleased with a reception at any 
place. 
There is no news. Nothing has been done in Eu 
rope. England is as insolent in language as ever; 
but this is only ridiculous, as it is apparently impotent.

Adieu.
