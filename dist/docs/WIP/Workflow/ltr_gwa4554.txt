My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although your letter of the tenth of June, which I have 
received, did not paint the prospects of France in the most 
pleasing colors, yet the events which have since taken place 
give a more gloomy aspect to the public affairs of that kingdom, than your letter gave reason to apprehend. 
</p><p>
A thousand circumstances, besides our distance from the 
theatre of action, made it improbable that we should have, 
in this country, a fair statement of facts and causes through 
the medium of the public prints ; and I have received no 
other accounts, than what have come in that channel. But 
taking up the most favorable of these, gloomy indeed appears 
the situation of France at this juncture. But it is hardly 
probable that even you, who are on the spot, can say with any 
precision how these things will terminate ; much less can we, 
at this distance, pretend to augur the event. We can only 
repeat the sincere wish, that much happiness may arise to the 
French nation, and to mankind in general, out of the severe 
evils which are inseparable from so important a revolution. 
</p><p>
In the present state of things we cannot expect, that any 
commercial treaty can now be formed with France ; but I 
have no doubt of your embracing the proper moment of arrangement, and of doing whatever may be in your power for 
the substantial interest of our country. 
</p><p>
The affairs of the United States go on well. There are 
some few clouds in our political hemisphere, but I trust that 
the bright sun of our prosperity will disperse them. 
</p><p>
The Indians on our western and southern frontiers are still 
troublesome, but such measures are taken as will, I presume, 
prevent any serious mischief from them ; I confess, however, 
that I do not believe these tribes will ever be brought to a 
quiescent state, so long as they may be under an influence 
which is hostile to the rising greatness of these states. 
</p><p>
From the complexion of some of our newspapers, foreigners would be led to believe, that inveterate political dissensions 
exist among us, . and that we are on the very verge of disunion ; but the fact is otherwise. The great body of the 
people now feel the advantages of the general government, 
and would not, I am persuaded, do anything that should destroy it ; but this kind of representations is an evil, which 
must be placed in opposition to the infinite benefits resulting 
from a free press ; and I am sure you need not be told, that in 
this country a personal difference in political sentiments is 
often made to take the garb of general dissensions. 
From the Department of State you are, I am informed, 
furnished with such papers and documents from time to 
time, as will keep you more particularly informed of the state 
of our affairs. I shall therefore add nothing further to this 
letter, than assurances of being always and sincerely yours, &c.
