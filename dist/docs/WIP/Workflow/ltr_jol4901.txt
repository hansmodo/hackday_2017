My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
We moved to this place on the 10th hist. Here we received the account from Synnepuxent, and remain 
at fault till some more particular accounts of the motions of the enemy enable me to judge of their designs. 
In the meantime our soldiers are recruiting in a plentiful country, as well as strong drink and women will permit them. 
</p><p>
These impediments, however, to their laying in a stock of good health are not so general as might be expected in an army situated as ours is. 
</p><p>
The men are exercised in smaller or greater numbers 
every day. The country people bring in a plenty of 
vegetables, &c. and we hear very few complaints 
from those immediately about us of the violations of 
private property. We are all anxious to hear some 
thing that will give us employment of a different kind 
</p><p>
from that which we have at present. My best regards 
to all our friends, and I remain ever 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>

I have no prospect yet of horses or servant,
