I have received your several favours of the 2d, 3d, and 
28th of March, and 6th of April. I thank you for them all, 
but especially for the last, which I consider as a distinguishing mark of your confidence and friendship. 
</p><p>
Conscious that it is the aim of my actions to promote the 
public good, and that no part of my conduct is influenced by 
personal enmity to individuals, I cannot be insensible to the 
artifice employed by some men to prejudice me in the 
public esteem. The circumstance of which you have 
obliged me with a communication, is among a number of 
other instances of the unfriendly views which have governed a certain gentleman from a very early period. Some 
of these have been too notorious not to have come to your 
knowledge ; others, from the manner in which they have 
been conveyed to me, will probably never be known, except to a very few. But you have perhaps heard enough 
yourself to make any further explanation from me unnecessary. 
</p><p>
The desire, however, which it is natural I should feel to 
preserve the good opinion of men of sense and virtue, conspiring with my wish to cultivate your friendship in particular, induces me to trouble you with a statement of some 
facts which will serve to place the present attack in its 
proper light. In doing this I shall recapitulate and bring 
into view a series of transactions, many of which have been 
known to you ; but some of which may possibly have 
escaped your memory. 
</p><p>
An opinion prevailing that the enemy were likely, shortly, 
to evacuate these States, I was naturally led to turn my 
thoughts to a plan of operations against Canada, in case that 
event should take place. A winter campaign, before the 
enemy could have an opportunity of reinforcing and putting 
themselves in a more perfect state of defence, appeared to 
promise the most speedy and certain success, and the route 
by Co-os offered itself as most direct and practicable. In 
this I fully agreed with <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> and some other gentlemen whom I consulted on the occasion; and on the 12th 
of September last I wrote to Congress accordingly, submitting it to them, whether it would not be advisable to be 
laying up magazines, opening a road, and making other 
preparations for the undertaking. They approved the project, and authorized me to carry it into execution. I the 
more readily entered into it from a consideration, that if 
circumstances should not permit us to carry on the enterprise, preparations towards it could easily be converted into 
another channel, and made serviceable to our operations 
elsewhere without any material addition of expense to the 
continent, because provisions, which would compose the 
principal part of the expense, were at all events to be purchased on Connecticut River, the only doubt being whether 
they should, be used in an expedition against Canada, or 
transported to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> — circumstances to determine this: 
with truth it may be added, that, excepting the articles of 
provision and forage, which, as before observed, would 
have been bought if no expedition by the way of Co-os 
had been in contemplation, the " incredible expense," 
mentioned by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> in his letter of March 4th, 
amounted to the purchase of a few pair of men's shoes, 
and some leather for moccasins only. If any other expense 
has been incurred, it is unknown to me — must have been 
by his order, and he alone answerable for it. 
</p><p>
In October following, Congress entered into arrangements with the Marquis de la Fayette for co-operating with 
the court of France, in an expedition against that country. 
In this scheme, one body of troops was to proceed from 
Co-os and penetrate by way of the river St. Francis ; others 
forming a junction at Niagara, were to enter Canada by 
that route ; and while these were operating in this manner, 
a French fleet and a body of French troops were to go up 
the river St. Lawrence, and take possession of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>. 
</p><p>
You are well acquainted with the opposition I gave to 
this plan, and my reasons at large for it. From what has 
since happened, they seem to have met the full approbation 
of Congress. The ideas I held up were principally these : 
that we ought not to enter into any contract with a foreign 
power, unless we were sure we should be able to fulfil our 
engagements — that it was uncertain whether the enemy 
would quit the States or not ; and in case they did not, it 
would be impracticable to furnish the aids which we had 
stipulated — that even if they should leave us, it was doubtful whether our own resources would be equal to the supplies required ; that therefore it would be impolitic to 
hazard a contract of the kind, and better to remain at 
liberty to act as future conjunctures should point out. I 
recommended, nevertheless, as there were powerful reasons 
to hope the enemy might go away, that eventual preparations should be made to take advantage of it, to possess 
ourselves of Niagara and other posts in that quarter, for the 
security of our frontiers, and to carry our views still 
further with respect to a conquest of Canada, if we should 
find ourselves able to prosecute such an enterprise. 
</p><p>
This, Congress in a subsequent resolve, approved, and 
directed to be done. It was not the least motive with me 
for recommending it, that operations of this nature seemed 
to be a very favourable object with this honourable body. 
The preparations on Hudson River were undertaken in 
consequence. 
</p><p>
Upon a nearer view of our finances and resources, and 
when it came to be decided that the enemy would continue 
for some time longer to hold the posts they were in possession of, in the course of the conferences with which I was 
honoured by the committee of Congress in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I 
suggested my doubts of the propriety of continuing our 
northern preparations upon so extensive a plan as was first 
determined. The committee were of opinion with me, that 
the state of our currency and supplies in general would 
oblige us to act on the defensive next campaign, except so 
far as related to an expedition into the Indian country for 
chastising the savages, and preventing their depredations 
on our back settlements ; and that though it would be extremely desirable to be prepared for pushing our operations 
further, yet our necessities exacting a system of economy 
forbade our launching into much extra expense for objects 
which were remote and contingent. This determination 
having taken place, all the northern preparations were discontinued, except such as were necessary towards the 
intended Indian expedition. 
</p><p>
Things were in this situation when I received a letter 
from General Bailey (living at Co-os), expressing some fears 
for the safety of the magazine at Co-os ; in consequence of 
which I directed the stores to be removed lower down the 
country. This I did to prevent a possibility of accident, 
though I did not apprehend they were in much danger. 
Sometime afterward I received the letter (No. 1) from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, expressing similar fears, to which I returned 
him the answer of 14th February, transmitted by him to 
Congress, (No. 2.) Knowing that preparations had been 
making at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and unacquainted with their true design, 
he inferred, from a vague expression in that letter, that the 
intention of attacking Canada was still adhered to, but that I 
had changed the plan, and was going by way of Lake Champlain or Ontario : either of these routes he pronounces impracticable, and represents that by Co-os as the only practicable one. He goes further, and declares, that " in the 
present state of our army, and the actual situation of our 
magazines, to attempt a serious invasion of Canada by 
whatever route, would prove unsuccessful, unless the fleet 
of our allies should at the same time co-operate with us, by 
sailing up the river St. Lawrenre." Though I differ with 
him as to the impracticability of both the other routes, I 
venture to go a step beyond him respecting our ability to 
invade Canada ; and am convinced, that in our present 
circumstances, and with the enemy in front, we cannot 
undertake a serious invasion of that country at all, even 
with the aid of an allied Fleet. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, sir, that I have uniformly made the 
departure of the enemy from these States an essential condition to the invasion of Canada, and that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> 
has entirely mistaken my intentions. Hoping that I had 
embarked in a scheme which our situation would not justify, 
he eagerly seizes the opportunity of exposing my supposed 
errors to Congress ; and in the excess of his intemperate 
zeal to injure me, exhibits himself in a point of view from 
which I imagine he will derive little credit. The decency 
of the terms in which he undertakes to arraign my conduct, 
both to myself and to Congress, and the propriety of the 
hasty appeal he has made, will, I believe, appear at least 
questionable to every man of sense and delicacy. 
</p><p>
The last paragraph of the extract with which you favour 
me, is a pretty remarkable one. I shall make no comments 
further than as it implies a charge of neglect on my part, in 
not writing to him but once since December. From the 
beginning of last campaign to the middle of December, about 
seven months, I have copies of near fifty letters to him, and 
about forty originals from him. I think it will be acknowledged the correspondence was frequent enough during that 
period ; and if it has not continued in the same proportion 
since, the only >reason was, that the season of the year, the 
troops being in winter-quarters, and <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s situation unfruitful of events, and unproductive of any military 
arrangements between us, afforded very little matter for 
epistolary intercourse ; and I flatter myself it will be readily 
believed, that I am sufficiently occupied with the necessary 
business of my station, and have no need of increasing it 
by multiplying letters without an object. If you were to 
peruse, my dear sir, the letters that have passed between 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> and myself for a lone time back, you would 
be sensible that I have no great temptation to court his 
correspondence, when the transacting of business does not 
require it. An air of design — a want of candour in many 
instances, and even of politeness, give no very inviting 
complexion to the correspondence on his part. As a specimen of this, I send you a few letters and extracts, which at 
your leisure, I shall be glad you will cast your eye upon. 
</p><p>
Last fall it was for some time strongly suspected that the 
enemy would transport the whole, or the greater part, of 
their force eastward, and combine one great land and sea 
operation against the French fleet in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> harbour : on 
this supposition, as I should go in person to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, the 
command next in importance was the posts on the North 
River. This properly would devolve on <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> ; 
but from motives of peculiar scrupulousness, as there had 
been a difference between us, I thought it best to know 
whether it was agreeable to him, before I directed his continuance. By way of compliment, I wrote him a letter 
containing the extract No. 3, expecting a cordial answer 
and cheerful acceptance. I received the evasive and unsatisfactory reply, No. 4. A few days after this, upon 
another occasion, I wrote him the letter No. 5, to which I 
received the extraordinary answer No. 6, which was passed 
over in silence. 
</p><p>
The plan of operations for the campaign being determined, a commanding officer was to be appointed for the 
Indian expedition. This command, according to all present 
appearance, will probably be of the second, if not of the first 
importance for the campaign. The officer conducting it 
has a flattering prospect of acquiring more credit than can 
be expected by any other this year, and he has the best 
reason to hope for success. General Lee, from his situation, 
was out of the question. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, who, by the 
way, would have been most agreeable to me, was so uncertain of continuing in the army, that I could not appoint 
him. <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> I need not mention. I therefore 
made the offer of it (for the appointment could no longer be 
delayed) to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, who was next in seniority, 
though perhaps I might have avoided it, if I had been so 
disposed, from his being in a command by the special appointment of Congress. My letter to him on the occasion 
you will find in No. 7. I believe you will think it was 
conceived in very candid and polite terms, and merited a 
rent answer from the one given it in No. 8. 
</p><p>
I discovered, very early in the war, symptoms of coldness 
and constraint in <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s behaviour to me. These 
increased as he rose into greater consequence; but we did 
not come to a direct breach till the beginning of last year. This was occasioned by a correspondence, which I thought 
made rather free with me, between him and General Conway, which accidentally came to my knowledge. The 
particulars of this affair you will find delineated in the 
packet herewith, endorsed " Papers respecting General 
Conway." Besides the evidence contained in them of the 
genuineness of the offensive correspondence, I have other 
proofs, still more convincing, which, having been given me 
in a confidential way, I am not at liberty to impart. 
</p><p>
After this affair subsided, I made it a point of treating 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> with all the attention and cordiality in my 
power, as well from a sincere desire of harmony, as from 
an unwillingness to give any cause of triumph to our enemies from an appearance of dissension among ourselves. 
I can appeal to the world and to the whole army, whether 
I have not cautiously avoided every word or hint that could tend to dismay <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> in any way. I am sorry his conduct to me has not been equally generous, and that 
he is continually giving me fresh proof's of malevolence and 
> i . It will not be doing him injustice to say, that besides the little underhand intrigues which he is frequently 
practising, there has hardly been any great military question in which his advice has been asked, that it has not been 
given in an equivocal and designing manner, apparently calculated to afford him an opportunity of censuring me, on the failure of whatever measures might be adopted. 
</p><p>
When I find that this gentleman does not scruple to take 
the most unfair advantages of me, I am under a necessity 
of explaining his conduct to justify my own. This, and the 
perfect confidence I have in you, have occasioned me to 
trouble you with so free a communication of the state of 
things between us. I shall still be as passive as a regard 
to my own character will permit. I am, however, uneasy, as 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> has endeavoured to impress Congress with 
an unfavourable idea of me, and as I only know this in a 
private confidential way, that I cannot take any step to 
remove the impression if it should be made. I am aware, 
sir, of the delicacy of your situation, and I mean this letter 
only for your own private information ; you will therefore 
not allow yourself to be embarrassed by its contents, but 
with respect to me, pass it over in silence. 
</p><p>
With the truest esteem and personal regard, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="me">Geo. Washington</a>..
