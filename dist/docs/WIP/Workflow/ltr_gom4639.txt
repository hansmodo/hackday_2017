Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The late King of this country has been publicly executed. 
He died in a manner becoming his dignity. Mounting the 
scaffold, he expressed anew his forgiveness of those who persecuted him, and a prayer that his deluded people might be 
benefitted by his death. On the scaffold he attempted to 
speak, but the commanding officer, Santerre, ordered the 
drums to be beat. The King made two unavailing efforts, 
but with the same bad success. The executioners threw him 
down, and were in such haste as to let fall the axe before his 
neck was properly placed, so that he was mangled. It would 
be needless to give you an affecting narrative of particulars. 
I proceed to what is more important, having but a few minutes to write in by the present good opportunity. 
</p><p>
The greatest care was taken to prevent a concourse of 
people. This proves a conviction, that the majority was not 
favorable to that severe measure. In effect the great mass of 
Parisian citizens mourned the fate of their unhappy Prince. 
I have seen grief, such as for the untimely death of a beloved 
parent. Everything wears an appearance of solemnity, which 
is awfully distressing. I have been told by a gentleman from 
the spot, that putting the King to death would be a signal for 
disbanding the army in Flanders. I do not believe this, but 
incline to think it will have some effect on that army, already 
perishing by want, and mouldering fast away. The people of 
that country, if the French army retreats, will, I am persuaded, take a severe vengeance for the injuries they have felt, 
and the insults they have been exposed to. Both are great. 
The war against France is become popular in Austria, and is 
becoming so in Germany. If my judgment be good, the testament of Louis the Sixteenth will be more powerful against 
the present rulers of this country, than an army of a hundred 
thousand men. You will learn the effect it has in England. 
</p><p>
I believe that the English will be wound up to a pitch of 
enthusiastic horror against France, which their cool and steady 
temper seems to be scarcely susceptible of. 
</p><p>
I enclose you the translation of a letter from Sweden, which 
I have received from Denmark. You will see thereby, that 
the Jacobin principles are propagated with zeal in every 
quarter. Whether the regent of Sweden intends to make himself King, is a moot point. All the world knows that the 
young Prince is not legitimate, although born under circumstances which render it, legally speaking, impossible to question his legitimacy. 
</p><p>
I consider a war between Britain and France as inevitable. The continental powers opposed to France are making 
great and prompt efforts, while on this side I as yet see but 
little done to oppose them. There is a treaty on foot, I believe, between England and Austria, whose object is the 
dismemberment of France. I have not proof, but some very 
leading circumstances. Britain will, I think, suspend her 
blow till she can strike very hard, unless indeed they should 
think it advisable to seize the moment of indignation against 
late events for a declaration of war. This is not improbable, 
because it may be coupled with those general declarations 
against all Kings under the name of tyrants, which contain a 
determination to destroy them, and the threat, that if the 
ministers of England presume to declare war, an appeal shall 
be made to the people, at the head of an invading army. Of 
course, a design may be exhibited of entering into the heart 
of Great Britain to overturn the constitution, destroy the 
rights of property, and finally to dethrone and murder the 
King. All which are things the English will neither approve 
of, nor submit to. 
</p><p>
Yours of the seventh of November is just received. I will 
reply to it by the first good opportunity.
