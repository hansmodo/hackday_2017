Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your Excellency's letters of the 
31st of March, and 4th of April ; the last, to-day. The 
one to Colonel Bland, as member of the Committee, 
has been read in Committee confidentially, and gave 
great satisfaction. The idea of not attempting to separate the army before the settlement of accounts, 
corresponds with my proposition. That of endeavouring to let them have some pay, has also appeared to 
me indispensable. The expectations of the army, as 
represented by your Excellency, are moderation itself 
To-morrow we confer with the Superintendent of Finance on the subject of money. There will be difficulty ; but not, we hope, insurmountable. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for the hints you are so obliging as to give me in your private letter. I do 
not wonder at the suspicions that have been infused ; 
</p><p>
n or should I be surprised to hear that I have been 
pointed out as one of the persons concerned in playing the game described. But foots must speak for 
themselves. The gentlemen, who "were here from the army, <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a>, who is still here, will be 
able to give a true account of those who have supported the just claims of the army, and of those who have endeavoured to elude them. 
</p><p>
There are two classes of men, Sir, in Congress, of 
very different views ; one attached to State, the other 
to Continental politics. The last have been strenuous 
advocates for funding the public debt upon solid securities ', the former have given every opposition in 
their power, and have only been dragged into the 
measures, which are now near being adopted, by the 
clamors of the army and other public creditors. 
The advocates for Continental funds have blended the 
interests of the army with other creditors, from a conviction that no funds, for partial purposes, will go 
through those States to whose citizens the United 
States are largely indebted ; or, if they should be 
carried through, from impressions of the moment, 
would have the necessary stability ; for the influence 
of those unprovided for would always militate against 
a provision for others, in exclusion of them. It is in 
vain to tell men, who have parted with a large part 
of their property on the public faith, that the services of the army are entitled to a preference. They 
would reason from their interest and their feelings. These would tell them, that they had as great a title 
as any other class of the community to public justice ; and that, while this was denied to them, it would be unreasonable to make them bear their part of the 
burden for the benefit of others. This is the way they would reason ; and as their influence in some of the 
States was considerable; they M'onlcl have been able to prevent any partial provision. 
</p><p>
But the question was not merely how to do justice 
to the creditors, hut how to restore public credit. 
Taxation in this country, it was found, could not supply a sixth part of the public necessities. The loans 
in Europe were far short of the balance, and the prospect every day diminishing; the Court of France telling us, in plain terms, she could not even do as 
much as she had done ; individuals in Holland, and 
everywhere else, refusing to part with their money, 
on the precarious tenure of the mere faith of this 
country, without any pledge for the payment either 
of principal or interest. 
</p><p>
In this situation, what was to be done ? It was 
essential to our cause that vigorous efforts should be 
made to restore public credit ; it was necessary to 
combine all the motives to this end, that could operate upon different descriptions of persons in the different States. The necessity and discontents of the 
army presented themselves as a powerful engine. 
</p><p>
But, Sir, these gentlemen would be puzzled to support their insinuations by a single fact. It was, indeed, proposed to appropriate the intended impost 
on trade to the army debt, and, what was extraordinary, by gentlemen who had expressed their dislike 
to the principle of the fund. I acknowledge I was 
one that opposed this ; for the reasons already assigned, and for these additional ones. That was the 
fund on which we most counted. To obtain further 
loans in Europe, it was necessary we should have a 
fund sufficient to pay the interest of what had been 
borrowed and what was to be borrowed. The truth 
was, these people, in this instance, wanted to play off 
the army against the funding system. 
As to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, I will give your Excellency a 
true explanation of his conduct. He had been, for 
some time, pressing Congress to endeavour to obtain 
funds, and had found a great backwardness in the 
business. He found the taxes unproductive in the 
different States ; he found the loans in Europe making a very slow progress ; he found himself pressed, 
on all hands, for supplies ; he found himself, in short, 
reduced to this alternative, either of making engagements which he could not fulfil, or declaring his resignation in case funds were not established by a 
given time. 
</p><p>
Had he followed the first course, the bubble must 
soon have burst ; he must have sacrificed his credit 
and his character ; and public credit, already in a 
ruined condition, must have lost its last support. He 
wisely judged it better to resign. This might increase 
the embarrassments of the moment, but the necessity 
of the case, it was to be hoped, would produce the 
proper measures ; and he might then resume the direction of the machine with advantage and success. 
He also had some hope that his resignation would 
prove a stimulus to Congress. 
</p><p>
He was, however, ill-advised in the publication of 
his letter of resignation. This was an imprudent 
step, and has given .a handle to his personal enemies, 
who, by playing upon the passions of others, have 
drawn some well-meaning men into the cry against 
him. But <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> certainly deserves a great deal 
from his country. I believe no man in this country, 
but himself, could have kept the money machine a-going during the period he has been in office. From 
every thing that appears, his administration has been 
upright, as well as able. 
</p><p>
The truth is, the old leaven of <a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Deane</a> and Lee is, 
at this day, working against <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>. He happened, in that dispute, to have been on the side of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Deane</a>, and certain men can never forgive him. A 
man, whom I once esteemed, and whom I will rather 
suppose duped than wicked, is the second actor in 
this business. 
</p><p>
The matter, with respect to the army, which has 
occasioned most altercation in Congress, and most dissatisfaction in the army, has been the half-pay. The 
opinions on this head have been two. One party was 
for referring the several lines to their States, to make 
commutation as they should think proper; the other, 
for making the commutation by Congress, and funding 
it on Continental security. I was of this last opinion, 
and so were all those who will be represented as 
having made use of the army as puppets. Our principal reasons were, â€” first, by referring the lines to 
their respective States, those who were opposed to 
the half-pay would have taken advantage of the officers' necessities to make the commutation far short 
of an equivalent ; secondly, the inequality which would 
have arisen in the different States, when the officers 
came to compare (as has happened in other cases), 
would have been a new source of discontent; thirdly, 
such a reference was a continuance of the old wretched State system, by which the ties between Congress 
and the army have been nearly dissolved, by which 
the resources of the States have been diverted from 
the common treasury, and wasted ; a system which 
your Excellency has often justly reprobated. 
</p><p>
I have gone into the details, to give you a just 
idea of the parties in Congress. I assure you, upon 
my honor. Sir, I have given you a candid state of 
facts, to the best of my judgment. The men against 
whom the suspicions you mention must be directed. 
are, in general, the most sensible, the most liberal, 
the most independent, and the most respectable, characters in our body, as well as the most unequivocal 
friends to the army. In a word, they are the men 
who think Continentally. I have the honor to be, with 
sincere respect and esteem. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. I am Chairman of a Committee for Peace 
Arrangements. We shall ask your Excellency's opinion at large, on a proper military peace establishment. I will just hint to your Excellency that our 
prejudices will make us wish to keep up as few 
troops as possible. 
</p><p>
We this moment learn an officer is arrived from Sir Guy Carleton, with despatches; probably, official accounts of peace.
