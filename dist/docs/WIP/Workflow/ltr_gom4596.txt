My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
My last was of the sixteenth. The riot of that day went off 
pretty easily, but the next morning two men were lanterned 
and mangled in the Parisian taste. This occasioned some 
little stir. There had been a pretty general summons to the 
friends of liberty, requesting them to meet in the Champ de 
Mars. The object of this meeting was to persuade the Assembly, by the gentle influence of the cord, to undo what they 
had done respecting the imprisoned monarch. As the different ministers and municipal officers had received it in charge 
from the Assembly, to maintain peace and see to the execution of the laws, they made proclamation and displayed the 
red flag. 
</p><p>
In coming from the British Ambassador s, about seven in the 
evening, I met a detachment of the militia with the red flag 
flying, and some of the civil officers. I went shortly after 
wards to a height to see the battle ; but it was over before I 
got to the ground ; for as the militia would not, as usual? 
ground their arms on receiving the word of command from the 
mob, this last began, according to custom, to pelt them with 
stones. It was hot weather, arid Sunday afternoon, for which 
time, according to usage immemorial, the inhabitants of this 
capital have generally some pleasurable engagement. To be 
disappointed in their amusement, to be paraded through the 
streets under a scorching sun, and then stand like holiday 
turkeys to be knocked down by brickbats, was a little more 
than they had patience to bear ; so that, without waiting for 
orders, they fired and killed a dozen or two of the ragged 
regiment. The rest ran off like lusty fellows.
</p><p>
If the militia had waited for orders, they might,. I fancy, 
have been all knocked down, before they received any. As 
it is, the business went off pretty easily. Some of them have 
since been assassinated, but not above five or six, as far as I 
can learn. Lafayette was very near being killed in the morning ; but the pistol snapped at his breast. The assassin was 
immediately secured, but he ordered him to be discharged. 
These are things on which no comment is necessary. I think 
we shall be quiet here a little while ; but it is possible enough, 
that seizing some plausible occasion, a violent effort will be 
made, and then, if the militia succeed, order will be estabed. Adieu. I am very truly and affectionately yours,
