DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your obliging favour of November i5th. I presented your compliments to Sir John Pringle, who was glad 
with me to hear of your welfare, and desired me to offer his 
best respects whenever I wrote to you. The Farmer's 
Letters were written by one Mr. Dickinson, of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
and not by me, as you seem to suppose. I only caused them 
to be reprinted here with that little Preface, and had no other 
hand in them, except that I see some of my sentiments formerly published are collected, and interwoven with those of 
others and his own, by the author. I am glad they afforded 
you any amusement. It is true, as you have heard, that 
troops are posted in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, on the pretence of preventing 
riots and protecting the custom-house officers ; but it is also 
true, that there was no intention among the people there, 
to oppose the landing of those troops, or to resist the execution of the law by arms. The riots talked of were sudden, 
unpremeditated things, that happened only among a few of 
the lower sort. Their plan of making war on this country 
is of a different kind. It is to be a war on commerce only, 
and consists in an absolute determination to buy and use no 
more of the manufactures of Britain, till the act is repealed. 
This is already agreed to by four provinces, and will be by 
all the rest in the ensuing summer. Eleven ships now here 
from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, which would have carried, one 
with another, fifty thousand pounds sterling each in goods, 
are going away in their ballast, as the Parliament seems determined not to repeal. I am inclined to think, however, 
that it will alter its mind before the end of the session. Otherwise it is to be feared the breach will grow wider by successive 
indiscretions on both sides. 
</p><p>
The subject you propose to me, the consequences of allowing a free exportation of corn, the advantages or disadvantages 
of the Concurrence, &c., is a very extensive one ; and I have 
been, and am at present, so much occupied with our American 
affairs, as that, if I were ever so capable of handling it, I 
have not time to engage in it at present to any purpose. I 
think, however, with you, that the true principles of commerce 
are yet but little understood, and that most of the acts of 
Parliament, arr&s and edicts of princes and states, relating 
to commerce, are political errors, solicited and obtained by 
particulars for private interest, under the pretext of public good. 
</p><p>
The bearer of this, Captain Ourry, is a particular friend of 
mine, who now only passes through Paris for Lyons and Nice, 
but in his return may stay in your city some time. He is a 
gentleman of excellent character and great merit, and as such 
I beg leave to recommend him to your civilities and advice, 
which may be of great service to him, as he is quite a stranger 
in Paris. With the greatest esteem and respect, I am, dear 
Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. Your English is extremely good ; but, if it is more 
easy for you to write in French, do not give yourself the trouble 
of writing in English, as I understand your French perfectly well.
