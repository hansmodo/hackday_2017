SIR: 
</p><p>
I have every reason to believe the information you enclosed me to be 
well founded. A note I got two days ago, from a person of good 
information, agrees substantially with yours. I think a fortnight more 
will decide the enemy's real intentions. By a woman from town last 
night, I am informed the enemy's plundering fleet sailed for George 
town yesterday morning. I am in hopes they will not be so successful 
there as they were at Santee. I enclose you an order on Mr. Richard 
son for 200 stand of arms, as the presumption is they are arrived, as I 
have notice of their leaving <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> the end of June. I have, 
also, enclosed in the order, a box of sugar for your use, which is now 
there at Richardson s. Enclosed is a brevet for Dr. Neufville. I find 
there is some uneasiness in Maham's corps about rank j I could wish 
you to order a board of officers to sit and determine in the dispute as 
soon as possible, or as circumstances will admit. As you agree with 
me that it is best to mount the whole corps to act as cavalry, it is more 
necessary to have all disputes about rank settled as soon as possible, as 
a new arrangement must necessarily take place; and I suppose the 
youngest officers must go out, as was the case in the late arrangement. 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,
