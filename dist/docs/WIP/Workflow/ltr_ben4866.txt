MY LORD : On my Return to Town I found your Favour, 
with the Schemes of your Lottery, to which I wish Success, 
and besides ordering some Tickets for myself, I have spoken 
well of it on every Occasion; but I find little Inclination 
among my Acquaintance to engage in Lotteries at such a 
Distance, and one cannot be very open in promoting them, 
it being contrary to express Acts of Parliament, as well as 
offensive to Administration here, which would avail itself 
of all that is to be gain'd that Way. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere Esteem, I am, my Lord, your 
Lordship's most obedient and most humble Serv.'
