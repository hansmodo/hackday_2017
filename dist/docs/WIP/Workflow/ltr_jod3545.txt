MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I have transmitted money to the young men whom 
you mentioned to me, and have expected, every day 
for a long time, to hear of their sailing in a cartel for 
America. They have been better treated since the 
change of ministers. My respects to their parents. 
</p><p>
It is now five months since my public reception 
here, but we have not yet learned that any news of it has arrived in America. The refugees in England 
are at their old game again. Andrew Sparhawk 
has published, in the Morning Post, that his brother 
has received a letter from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that Massachusetts and several other States were upon the point of 
overturning the new government, throwing off the authority of Congress, and returning to the government 
of Great Britain. Their blood-thirsty souls are not 
yet satiated. They are laboring to bring on again an 
offensive war. But I think they can t succeed. I 
suppose the unhappy affair of the county of Hampshire is the thing that gave occasion to this representation. Our countrymen must be very unreasonable if they can t be easy and happy under the government they have. I don t know where they will 
find a better, or how they will make one. I dread 
the consequences of the differences between chiefs. 
If Massachusetts gets into parties, they will worry 
one another very rudely. But I rely on the honesty 
and sobriety as well as good sense of the people. 
These qualities will overawe the passions of individuals and preserve a steady administration of the laws. 
</p><p>
My duty to my mother and to your father. I hope 
to see them again. Love to the children and all 
friends. What shall I say of my brother Cranch ? 
I long, and yet I dread to hear from him. 
</p><p>
I hope to sign the treaty this week or next, or the week after. All points are agreed on, and nothing 
remains but to transcribe the copies fair. This government is so complicated, that months are consumed 
in doing what might be done in another in an hour. 
</p><p>
I don t know what to do with the list of articles 
you send me. It would be better for you to write to Ingraham and Bromfield. I will pay.
