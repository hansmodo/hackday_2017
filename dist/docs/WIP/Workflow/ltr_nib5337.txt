My dear Sir 
</p><p>
Leaving to our friends Mess". Cowperthwait &amp; Dunlap to give you all the details, I shall employ the only few 
moments of leisure I can command before the sailing of the Steamship, to say two or three things which may interest you. 
</p><p>
I . We have settled with Govt. for our bonds, and settled 
in a way particularly agreeable. You know my opinion, which 
I have never concealed, in regard to the individuals who 
have for the last ten years governed the country. These 
opinions are confirmed rather than changed. But looking, as 
I do, to what I deem the great interests of the country, &amp; 
Specially bound to protect the interests committed to my 
charge, my object has been to bring the existing Govt. to 
such a course of measures as would remedy present evils, 
until some political revolution should restore wiser counsels 
at Washington. To bring this about, there was no safe course but one of open and decided defiance, to show that the Bank 
was not at all afraid of the administration, and would not 
depart from its own policy until the Govt. had renounced 
the follies which it was laboring to propagate. Accordingly 
it became necessary to say that the Bank U.S. and the other 
banks would not resume specie payments until the Govt. had 
announced its own policy. The parties stood in that attitude, 
</p><p>
the good cause weakened by the desertion &amp; the weakness 
of those <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 21/2 per cent patriots but still strong 
enough to face the enemy. Our efforts were of course directed 
to the repeal of the specie circular, &amp; when that was done, 
and the Adm'n . made a last rally on the sub treasury bill, by 
great exertion they were defeated on that point. This settled 
the matter. The real question, as you know perfectly well, 
was, whether the Govt. should carry on its finances by the instrumentality of banks, or of special receivers of Gold &amp; Silver only; and the vote of the H. of Rep's . decided that the 
sense of the country was for the old mode. The adjournment 
of Congress hastened the process of repentance, by leaving 
the Adm'n . without any means of carrying on the public business, unless by the sale of the Bonds. I had taken my own 
position in that narrow defile, thro which I was sure they 
would have to pass, and where accordingly we met. What befell, you may imagine, since we have come out good friends ; 
and after a little coquetry and a little flirtation, I think it 
not improbable that Mr (not Mrs ) Woodbury &amp; I will be tender &amp; true, after the Douglass fashion. 
</p><p>
The settlement is in this form : 
</p><p>
The first bond due in September next, will be divided into three instalments, payable on the 15th . of August, September and October, respectively. 
</p><p>
The second bond, due in September <a href='/results.php?year=1839'>1839</a>, is immediately cashed on the 1st ins*. 
</p><p>
The third; the Sec'y is not yet sufficiently pressed to sell but when he does sell, we are to have the refusal. 
The money is placed at once to the credit of the Treasurer 
of the United States, &amp; remains on deposit with us with 
out interest and the See 7 gives a List, &amp; the Sec'y of War 
gives another list, of the points where he wants the disbursements made, which embrace the whole West &amp; South West, 
and the warrants of the Treasurer are drawn on the Bank of 
the United States, payable in Missouri, Arkansas &amp;c &amp;c. 
</p><p>
The benefit of time and exchange are thus apparent and 
the Bank is now actually a depository of the public money; 
/ so that the result is, that, after all the nonsense of the 
last few years, the Govt. takes in payment of a bond, a credit 
in a bank which does not pay specie yet, and which had declared that it did not mean to pay specie until that very 
Gov had abandoned its course. Our Washington friends 
are scarcely aware of the concession which this involves, and 
I have taken pains, throughout the country, that the opposition should indulge in no exultation no sarcasm nothing which should startle the treasury and blight our budding 
loves; for my present intention is to make the Bank a 
general depository of the funds of the Govt. You know what 
a difficult and almost incredible work that will be, but 
there is no room for despair after what has occurred, for 
the partizans of the Gov are not yet recovered from the 
amazement caused by this recent inexplicable movement. 
</p><p>
You see that we resume on the 13th of this month. We be 
gin without having sacrificed any great interest. We begin 
with a wide circle of resumers, whom our delay has enabled to prepare; and we begin after having fairly beaten down the\ 
Gov., and secured the ascendency of reason for the future./ 
We arrive in port without having been under the necessity 
of throwing over any of our cargo. We arrive, for every useful 
purpose, just as soon as our neighbours, who lost over board 
a large part of the passengers; and we only stopped on the 
way to sink a pirate. So that, on the whole, I have no reason 
to be dissatisfied with our course. 
</p><p>
2. Just as we were preparing our machinery for the New 
York concern, we found, to our great surprize, that under the 
law it was doubtful whether the Bank, as a corporation, could 
become an associate, and we were obliged to give up our 
plan. I think it very probable, however, that the object will 
be accomplished, even in a better form, if we make an arrangement with a small association to do our business in New 
York. We say nothing of this on our side of the water; but I 
think that the arrival after you receive this, will give you de 
tails. I mention it now, merely that you may know that we 
shall probably soon do the largest commercial business in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. . . .
