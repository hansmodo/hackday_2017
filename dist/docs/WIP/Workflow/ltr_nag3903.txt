DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 8th April has been received; and as I have had 
no direct opportunity to give it an answer, and as the subject did not 
require it immediately, I have omitted it. I cannot decide on one part 
of your letter, that is, respecting half-pay. If you were entitled to 
half-pay on your former standing, you are entitled to it now; but, if 
you mean upon the present reduction proposed, there can be no half-pay establishment follow it, as I have no authority for the purpose, nor 
</p><p>
can I conceive the officers would have the least right to expect such a 
thing. Their services were due to the State, from the situation it was 
in, and those temporary corps afforded them a much more honorable 
and agreeable service than serving in the militia; and as the Continent 
takes the expense upon themselves until their reduction, it is all that 
can be expected and, to continue them longer than they are useful, 
would be multiplying expense without sufficient object, for no country 
ever required economy more than ours to complete their independence. 
I left the business of reducing the regiments entirely to Gen. Marion; 
if it could be effected, well, but if not, let them remain as they were, 
until the men's term of service expires. He informs me that he has 
united all the horse under Col. Maham, and directed your men to 
do duty at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>; this is perfectly agreeable to me, if so to you. 
I directed, a few days past, a company of artillery to join you at 
<a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, and to your orders, in defence of that place. I am much 
afraid the enemy will attempt something against Waccamaw, as I am 
told there is a great quantity of provisions there. 
</p><p>
I am, with great esteem, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
