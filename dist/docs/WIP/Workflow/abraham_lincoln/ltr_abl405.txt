MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:
</p><p>
I understand your position as stated in your letter and by General Marcy. To reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the offensive
within a month, or even six weeks, is impossible. In addition to that arrived and now arriving from the Potomac (about 10,000 men, I
suppose), and about 10,000 I hope you will have from <a href="/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="co-worker">Burnside</a> very
soon, and about 5000 from Hunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another man within a month. Under these circumstances
the defensive for the present must be your only care. Save the army first, where you are, if you can; secondly, by removal, if you must.
You, on the ground, must be the judge as to which you will attempt,
and of the means for effecting it. I but give it as my opinion that
with the aid of the gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned above
you can hold your present position--provided, and so long as, you can
keep the James River open below you. If you are not tolerably
confident you can keep the James River open, you had better remove as
soon as possible. I do not remember that you have expressed any
apprehension as to the danger of having your communication cut on the
river below you, yet I do not suppose it can have escaped your attention.
</p><p>
Yours very truly,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
</p><p>
P.S.--If at any time you feel able to take the offensive, you are not restrained from doing so.
<p>
A.L.
