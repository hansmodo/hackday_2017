BRIGADIER-GENERAL SCHURZ, Mount Jackson, Virginia:
</p><p>
Your long letter is received. The information you give is valuable. You say it is fortunate that <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="co-worker">Fremont</a> did not intercept <a href="/results.php?tla=tjj" rel="adversary">Jackson</a>; that
<a href="/results.php?tla=tjj" rel="adversary">Jackson</a> had the superior force, and would have overwhelmed him. If this is so, how happened it that <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="co-worker">Fremont</a> fairly fought and routed him
on the 8th? Or is the account that he did fight and rout him false and fabricated? Both <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="co-worker">General Fremont</a> and you speak of <a href="/results.php?tla=tjj" rel="adversary">Jackson</a> having
beaten Shields. By our accounts he did not beat Shields. He had no engagement with Shields. He did meet and drive back with disaster
about 2000 of Shields's advance till they were met by an additional brigade of Shields's, when <a href="/results.php?tla=tjj" rel="adversary">Jackson</a> himself turned and retreated.
Shields himself and more than half his force were not nearer than twenty miles to any of it.
