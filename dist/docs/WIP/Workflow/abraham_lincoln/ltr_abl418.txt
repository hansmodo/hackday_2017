EXECUTIVE MANSION, <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city origin'>WASHINGTON</a>,
</p><p>
December 10, <a href="/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>.
</p><p>
Hon. J. K. DuBois.
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR:--In the summer of <a href="/results.php?year=1859">1859</a>, when Mr. Freeman visited <a href='/results.php?city=springfield' rel='city'>Springfield</a>, Illinois, in relation to the McCallister and Stebbins bonds I promised him that, upon certain conditions, I would ask members of the Legislature to give him a full and fair hearing of his
case. I do not now remember, nor have I time to recall, exactly what the conditions were, nor whether they were completely performed; but
there can be in no case any harm [in] his having a full and fair hearing, and I sincerely wish it may be given him.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
