HON. G. F. SHEPLEY.

DEAR SIR:--Dr. Kennedy, bearer of this, has some apprehension that Federal officers not citizens of Louisiana may be set up as
candidates for Congress in that State. In my view there could be no possible object in such an election. We do not particularly need
members of Congress from there to enable us to get along with legislation here. What we do want is the conclusive evidence that
respectable citizens of Louisiana are willing to be members of Congress and to swear support to the Constitution, and that other
respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and send them. To send a parcel of Northern men here as representatives,
elected, as would be understood (and perhaps really so), at the point of the bayonet, would be disgusting and outrageous; and were I
a member of Congress here, I would vote against admitting any such man to a seat.
</p><p>
Yours very truly,
</p>
<p><a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN</a></p>
