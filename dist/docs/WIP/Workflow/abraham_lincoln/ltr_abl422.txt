HONORABLE SECRETARY OF WAR.
</p><p>
Sir:--Two Ohio regiments and one Illinois regiment which were captured at Hartsville have been paroled and are now at Columbus, Ohio. This brings the Ohio regiments substantially to their homes. I am strongly impressed with the belief that the Illinois regiment better be sent to Illinois, where it will be recruited and put in
good condition by the time they are exchanged so as to re-enter the service. They did not misbehave, as I am satisfied, so that they
should receive no treatment nor have anything withheld from them by way of punishment.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
