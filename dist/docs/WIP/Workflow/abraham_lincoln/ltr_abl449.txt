MAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER.
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL:--I have just received your letter of the 25th of June.
</p><p>
I assure you, and you may feel authorized in stating, that the recent
change of commanders in the Department of the South was made for no
reasons which convey any imputation upon your known energy,
efficiency, and patriotism; but for causes which seemed sufficient,
while they were in no degree incompatible with the respect and esteem
in which I have always held you as a man and an officer.
</p><p>
I cannot, by giving my consent to a publication of whose details I
know nothing, assume the responsibility of whatever you may write.
In this matter your own sense of military propriety must be your
guide, and the regulations of the service your rule of conduct.
</p><p>
I am very truly your friend,<br/>
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
