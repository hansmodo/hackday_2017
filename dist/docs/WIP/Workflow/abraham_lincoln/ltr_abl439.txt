EXECUTIVE MANSION, <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city origin'>WASHINGTON</a>,<br/>
April 4, <a href="/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.
</p><p>
GENERAL HUNTER AND ADMIRAL DUPONT:
</p><p>
This is intended to clear up an apparent inconsistency between the
recent order to continue operations before <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> and the former
one to remove to another point in a certain contingency. No censure
upon you, or either of you, is intended. We still hope that by
cordial and judicious co-operation you can take the batteries on
Morris Island and Sullivan's Island and <a href='/results.php?city=fort sumter' rel='city'>Fort Sumter</a>. But whether you
can or not, we wish the demonstration kept up for a time, for a
collateral and very important object. We wish the attempt to be a
real one, though not a desperate one, if it affords any considerable
chance of success. But if prosecuted as a demonstration only, this
must not become public, or the whole effect will be lost. Once again
before <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, do not leave until further orders from here. Of
course this is not intended to force you to leave unduly exposed Hilton Head or other near points in your charge.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
