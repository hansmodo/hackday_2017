<p><i>[From a Letter to Joshua F. Speed.[ <a href='/results.php?city=springfield' rel='city origin'>Springfield</a>. October 22, <a href="/results.php?year=1846">1846</a></i></p>

<p>We have another boy, born the 10th of March. He is very much such a
child as Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is &quot;short and
low,&quot; and I expect always will be. He talks very plainly&mdash;almost as
plainly as anybody. He is quite smart enough. I sometimes fear that he
is one of the little rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about five than
ever after. He has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the
offspring of such animal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger
came to tell me Bob was lost; but by the time I reached the house his
mother had found him and had him whipped, and by now, very likely, he is
run away again.</p>
