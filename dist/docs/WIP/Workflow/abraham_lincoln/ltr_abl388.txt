<p><i>[His Letter to Horace Greeley.] August 22, <a href="/results.php?year=1862">1862</a></i></p>


<p>I have just read yours of the 19th instant, addressed to myself through
the &quot;New York Tribune.&quot;</p>

<p>If there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert them.</p>

<p>If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely drawn, I do not now and here argue against them.</p>

<p>If there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive it, in deference to an old friend whose heart I have always supposed to be right.</p>

<p>As to the policy I &quot;seem to be pursuing,&quot; as you say, I have not meant
to leave any one in doubt. I would save the Union. I would save it in the shortest way under the Constitution.</p>

<p>The sooner the national authority can be restored, the nearer the Union will be, - the Union as it was.</p>

<p>If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them.</p>

<p>If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them.</p>

<p><i>My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and not either to save or to destroy slavery.</i></p>

<p>If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; if I
could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could
save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.</p>

<p>What I do about slavery and the coloured race, I do because I believe it
helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not
believe it would help to save the Union.</p>

<p>I shall do less whenever I shall believe that what I am doing hurts the
cause; and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help
the cause.</p>

<p>I shall try to correct errors where shown to be errors, and I shall adopt new views as fast as they shall appear to be true views.</p>

<p>I have here stated my purpose according to my views of official duty,
and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all
men everywhere could be free.</p>
