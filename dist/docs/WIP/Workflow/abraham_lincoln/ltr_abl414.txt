MY DEAR GENERAL BANKS:--Early last week you left me in high hope with your assurance that you would be off with your expedition at the end
of that week, or early in this. It is now the end of this, and I have just been overwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a
requisition made by you which, I am assured, cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of two months. I enclose you a copy of the
requisition, in some hope that it is not genuine--that you have never seen it. My dear General, this expanding and piling up of
impedimenta has been, so far, almost our ruin, and will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned. If you had the articles of this
requisition upon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make them of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get vessels
together in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty thousand men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the
cargoes aboard in two weeks more. And, after all, where you are going you have no use for them. When you parted with me you had no
such ideas in your mind. I know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as you said. You must get back to
something like the plan you had then, or your expedition is a failure before you start. You must be off before Congress meets.  You would
be better off anywhere, and especially where you are going, for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling forage to feed the
animals that draw them, and taking at least two thousand men to care for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be two thousand good
soldiers.  Now, dear General, do not think this is an ill-natured letter; it is the very reverse.  The simple publication of this requisition would ruin you.
</p><p>
Very truly your friend,
</p>
