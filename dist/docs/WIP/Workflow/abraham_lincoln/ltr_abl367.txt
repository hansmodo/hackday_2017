<p>My dear General, I do not remember that you and I ever met personally. I write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost inestimable
service you have done the country. I wish to say a word further. When you first reached the vicinity of <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>, I thought you should do
what you finally did march the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the transports, and thus go below; and I never had any
faith, except a general hope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition and the like could succeed. When you got below and took
Port Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river and join General Banks, and when you turned northward, east of the
Big Black, I feared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right and I was wrong.
</p><p>
Yours very truly,
