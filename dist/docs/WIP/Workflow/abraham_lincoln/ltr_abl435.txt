Mr. M. is now with me on the question of the <a href='/results.php?city=honolulu' rel='city'>Honolulu</a> Commissioner. It pains me some that this tilt for the place of Colonel Baker's
friend grows so fierce, now that the Colonel is no longer alive to defend him. I presume, however, we shall have no rest from it. In
self-defense I am disposed to say, "Make a selection and send it to me."
