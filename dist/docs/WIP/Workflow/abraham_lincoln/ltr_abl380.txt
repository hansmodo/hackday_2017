<p>My dear Sir, ... You are not a friend of slavery in the abstract. In
that speech you spoke of &quot;the peaceful extinction of slavery&quot; and used
other expressions indicating your belief that the thing was, at some
time, to have an end. Since then we have had thirty-six years of
experience; and this experience has demonstrated, I think, that there is
no peaceful extinction of slavery in prospect for us. The signal failure
of <a href="/results.php?tla=hec" rel="">Henry Clay</a> and other good and great men, in <a href='/results.php?city=1849' rel='city'>1849</a>, to effect anything
in favour of gradual emancipation in Kentucky, together with a thousand
other signs, extinguishes that hope utterly. On the question of liberty,
as a principle, we are not what we have been. When we were the political
slaves of King George, and wanted to be free, we called the maxim that
&quot;all men are created equal&quot; a self-evident truth; but now when we have
grown fat, and have lost all dread of being slaves ourselves, we have
become so greedy to be <i>masters</i> that we call the same maxim &quot;a
self-evident lie.&quot; The Fourth of July has not quite dwindled away; it is
still a great day for burning fire-crackers!</p>

<p>That spirit which desired the peaceful extinction of slavery has itself
become extinct with the <i>occasion</i> and the <i>men</i> of the Revolution.
Under the impulse of that occasion, nearly half the States adopted
systems of emancipation at once; and it is a significant fact that not a
single State has done the like since. So far as peaceful, voluntary
emancipation is concerned, the condition of the negro slave in America,
scarcely less terrible to the contemplation of the free mind, is now as
fixed and hopeless of change for the better as that of the lost souls of
the finally impenitent. The Autocrat of all the Russias will resign his
crown and proclaim his subjects free republicans, sooner than will our
American masters voluntarily give up their slaves.</p>

<p>Our political problem now is, &quot;Can we as a nation continue together
<i>permanently - for ever</i> - half slave, and half free?&quot; The problem is too
mighty for me. May God in his mercy superintend the solution.</p>
