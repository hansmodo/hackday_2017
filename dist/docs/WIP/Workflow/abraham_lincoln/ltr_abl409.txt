THOMAS H. CLAY, Cincinnati, Ohio:
</p><p>
You cannot have reflected seriously when you ask that I shall order General Morgan's command to Kentucky as a favor because they have
marched from Cumberland Gap. The precedent established by it would evidently break up the whole army. Buell's old troops, now in
pursuit of Bragg, have done more hard marching recently; and, in fact, if you include marching and fighting, there are scarcely any
old troops east or west of the mountains that have not done as hard service. I sincerely wish war was an easier and pleasanter business
than it is; but it does not admit of holidays. On Morgan's command, where it is now sent, as I understand, depends the question whether
the enemy will get to the Ohio River in another place.
