MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK.
</p><p>
DEAR SIR: -- <a href="/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="co-worker">General Burnside</a> wishes to cross the Rappahannock with his army, but his grand division commanders all oppose the movement. If
in such a difficulty as this you do not help, you fail me precisely in the point for which I sought your assistance You know what <a href="/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="co-worker">General Burnside's</a> plan is, and it is my wish that you go with him to the
ground, examine it as far as practicable, confer with the officers, getting their judgment, and ascertaining their temper -- in a word,gather all the elements for forming a judgment of your own, and then
tell <a href="/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="co-worker">General Burnside</a> that you do approve or that you do not approve his plan. Your military skill is useless to me if you will not do this.
</p><p>
Yours very truly,
</p><p>
A. LINCOLN
