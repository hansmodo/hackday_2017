EXECUTIVE MANSION, <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city origin'>WASHINGTON</a>,<br/>
March 20, <a href="/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.
</p><p>
WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:--Whereas, it appears to my satisfaction that Thomas W. Knox, a correspondent of the New York Herald, has been by
the sentence of a court-martial excluded from the military department under command of <a href="/results.php?tla=usg" rel="co-worker met">Major-General Grant</a>, and also that General Thayer,
president of the court-martial which rendered the sentence, and Major-General McClernand, in command of a corps of that department,
and many other respectable persons, are of opinion that Mr. Knox's offense was technical rather than wilfully wrong, and that the
sentence should be revoked: now, therefore, said sentence is hereby so far revoked as to allow Mr. Knox to return to <a href="/results.php?tla=usg" rel="co-worker met">General Grant's</a>
headquarters, and to remain if <a href="/results.php?tla=usg" rel="co-worker met">General Grant</a> shall give his express assent, and to again leave the department if <a href="/results.php?tla=usg" rel="co-worker met">General Grant</a> shall refuse such assent.
