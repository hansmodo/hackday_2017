HON. SECRETARY OF WAR.
</p><p>
DEAR SIR:--I have again concluded to relieve General Curtis. I see no other way to avoid the worst consequences there. I think of
<a href="/results.php?tla=jms" rel="co-worker">General Schofield</a> as his successor, but I do not wish to take the matter of a successor out of the hands of yourself and <a href="/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="co-worker met">General Halleck</a>.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
