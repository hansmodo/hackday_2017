HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD AND HON. SALMON P. CHASE.
</p><p>
GENTLEMEN:--You have respectively tendered me your resignations as Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury of the United
States.  I am apprised of the circumstances which may render this course personally desirable to each of you; but after most anxious
consideration my deliberate judgment is that the public interest does not admit of it. I therefore have to request that you will resume
the duties of your departments respectively.
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
</p>
