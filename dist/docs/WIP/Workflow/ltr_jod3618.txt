MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
LAST year I took French leave of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to go 
home. This year I have the mortification to think 
we are not half way through the session. I see no 
prospect of getting away before the middle of June.

There is nothing new, foreign or domestic. Electioneering begins to open her campaign. The letter 
from Jay, in the enclosed pamphlet, is called by the 
southern gentlemen, an electioneering letter. The 
toasts in the enclosed paper, are no doubt electioneering toasts. If Washington continues, I suppose Jeffer 
son and Jay may both be set up for Vice President. 
If he renounces, they will be set up for President and 
Vice President both, and let the lot come out as it 
will, the chief contest will be between these two, ac 
cording to present appearances. 
</p><p>
My mind, you know, is made up, and I am much 
at my ease. I am impatient and distressed while my 
mind is in suspense. Once decided, I have no longer 
any uneasiness. 
</p><p>
It cannot be long before we shall have news from 
Europe. My mother's relief from her fears respecting her arm is a great pleasure to me. I hope to see 
her in good health in June. Have you given her my 
barrel of flour ? You have had a fine season for your wood. I hope you have hoarded enough to last the year. 
</p><p>
Adieu. 
</p><p>
J. A,
