Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... On this whole subject of publication, my theory 
is very simple. I believe that nine tenths of the errors of men 
arise from their ignorance and that the great security of 
all our institutions is in the power, the irresistible power, of 
truth. I recollect well when twenty years ago I opposed in the 
Legislature 2 of my State the measures taken to prostrate the former Bank, how much of the opposition to the Bank 
was the result of downright ignorance of its meaning and its 
operations, and I have lived to see the very individuals the 
most zealous in the work of destruction, candidly confess, as 
they have grown older and wiser, that they did not properly 
appreciate the institution. I know what was then wanting 
and I am resolved that it shall not now be wanting. I saw 
the manner in which the small demagogues of that day deceived the community and I mean to try to prevent the 
small demagogues of this day from repeating the same delusion. For this, there is but one course, the free circulation of plain honest truths by means of the press. There is 
one mode in which you can much assist me. It is by the transmission of a list, such as your long practice has enabled you 
to accumulate, of citizens with their respective addresses in various parts of the United States. Your own subscription 
list, with the additions which you propose to make for increased diffusion of your paper, would form excellent materials &amp; I would gladly defray the expence, if necessary, of 
copying that list which, for greater convenience, should be divided into States
