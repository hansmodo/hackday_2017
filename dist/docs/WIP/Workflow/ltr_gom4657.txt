Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since mine of the fifth, I learn that the militia have, in general, quitted the standard of Dumouriez, but he has about twelve 
thousand of the regular troops, and there is reason to believe 
that others mean to join him. The terror excited by his defection begins to subside, or rather it is suspended until some 
great blow shall be struck. There seems to be more of treason in this country than was imagined, and every day increases 
suspicion, which, whether well or ill founded, has always the 
effect of distracting the public councils. 
</p><p>
Most people wonder at the delay of the Prince de Cobourg; 
but, besides the necessity of collecting his magazines, artillery, 
&c., which is a very heavy affair, I have reason to believe that 
he waits until some other schemes are ready for execution, 
and, therefore, it may be yet four or five days before he commences the siege of Valenciennes. Conde is a needful preliminary, as in that place he must receive the various supplies 
which come up the Scheldt. It cannot hold out long. 
</p><p>
You will observe that Dumouriez, and, after him, the Prince 
de Cobourg, declare themselves in favor of the late Constitution, with such alterations as the nation may adopt ; and the 
latter gives the most solemn assurances, that he will not meddle 
with the internal affairs of France. His conduct is wise, and 
will doubtless gain them a considerable party in the country, if 
they act consistently with those declarations. It is said here, 
(and those who say so to me, tell me that they speak on good 
authority,) that the powers allied against France begin already 
to be disunited. That they will disagree, if very successful, 
there can be little doubt, because they are actuated by different interests and motives ; but, I think that at present, those 
who assert the disunion rather speak from induction than from 
information. Custine has retired, you see, to Weissenbourg, 
and there he has a bad position. The enemy will probably 
attempt to cut off his retreat, before they attack him in front. 
As yet, we do not learn that the Austrians have crossed the 
Rhine in Upper Alsace, and that will be, perhaps, a preliminary to the operations against him. 
</p><p>
As far as I can judge of the public mind, it appears that 
there is a general state of suspense. Success, on either side, 
will fix the opinions of a very great number, who will then act, 
to show their sincerity. Here, they hang people for giving 
their opinion in favor of Royalty, (that is, they cut off their 
heads,) but yet, I am told, that such opinion is openly avowed 
and supported in the streets. I am told, that there is a majority, even of the Convention, who think a King necessary ; but, 
as they see the loss of their own lives, in connexion with the 
re-establishment of the throne, it is not to be supposed, that 
they would tell such thoughts ; and, therefore, the information 
may well be suspected. Time will show that there are among 
them some false brethren; and, certainly, the most intelligent 
must be convinced, that the republican virtues are not yet of 
Gallic growth. 
The Duke of Orleans is in the way of reaping the fruits of 
his conduct, being, as you will see, sent a prisoner to Marseilles. 
The storm thickens all around us ; but, as yet, one cannot certainly determine how it will burst. The attempts made to ex 
cite disturbances in Paris have hitherto proved ineffectual ; but 
that stroke seems to be reserved for the moment when the 
Deputies, now in commission in the departments, shall return. 
It is possible, merely possible, that all may go off smoothly ; 
but the chances are greatly the other way. I am, &LC.

P. S. I should have mentioned that, I am told, there is a 
plan in operation here to detach Great Britain from the con 
federation, and to make a separate peace with her; but I am 
persuaded that the attempt, in itself vain, must fail, from the 
parties said to be employed, if from no other cause.
