MY DEAR JANET: 
</p><p>
I take the earliest opportunity of letting you hear I am well. We have made an excursion to <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city origin'>St. Johns</a> with the small corps with which I left <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. We found the enemy's vessel, 
which mounts sixteen guns, almost ready to sail. We had but two pieces of artillery with carriages by no means sufficient to 
undertake a siege, or to destroy the vessel, which is under the 
cannon of the fort. It has therefore been judged expedient by 
everybody to put in practice the first project of throwing a boom 
over the channel at the <a href='/results.php?city=isle aux noix' rel='city'>Isle Aux Noix</a>, which we are now about 
getting ready. We have not as yet received intelligence that 
can be relied on with respect to the intentions of the Canadians ; 
but a Mr. Hazen, who lives at <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city origin'>St. Johns</a>, and is a sensible man, 
is of opinion that tho' they will not take up arms against us, yet 
they will not act offensively in our favor. When we are certain 
of their friendship, so far as to lie quiet, we shall march a strong 
detachment by land into the country, which we shall be masters 
of, if Mr. Carleton is not speedily reinforced. We had a little 
skirmish with the Indians; two very good officers wounded 
and nine or ten privates killed ; a good deal of confusion in the 
action; the Yorkers little acquainted with wood-fighting; the 
Connecticut men behaved well for the most part, but in the 
evening, when some shells were thrown from the fort, they 
showed a degree of apprehension that displeased me much ; but I 
hope and believe it will wear off by a little practice. The 
general thought proper to remove a little farther oft' with the 
boats and vessels ; and they embarked with such confusion as 
can only be palliated by saying they are young troops. I have 
endeavored to make them ashamed of themselves, and hope this 
won't happen again. I believe I am on a tolerable footing with 
them. Poor Schuyler is in so miserable a state of health as to 
make him an object of compassion. 
</p><p>
I wrote you from Crown Point, and also your worthy <a href="/results.php?tla=rol" rel="kin met">father</a>. 
I then referred you to him for news. I must now beg of him to 
read this letter, which contains all I have to say, being much 
hurried. Should any report prevail at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> of any accident 
having happened to me, I have requested Walter Livingston to 
send you this by express. 
</p><p>
Adieu! my dearest Janet. Rest assured of my warmest affection. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rim" rel="me">RICHARD MONTGOMERY</a>.
