After a long delay, which had wearied me to the point of resolving to set out again myself, tidings have at last reached me from my ill-fated party. Mr. Haler came in last night, 
having, the night before, reached Red River settlement, with some three or four others. Including Mr. King and Proue, we have lost eleven of our party. Occurrences, after I left them, 
are briefly these, so far as they are within Haler's knowledge. I say briefly, my dear Jessie, because now I am unwilling to force myself to 
dwell upon particulars. I wish for a time to shut out these things from my mind, to leave this country, and all thoughts and all things connected with recent events, which have been 
so signally disastrous as absolutely to astonish me with a persistence of misfortune, which no precaution has been adequate on my part to avert. 
</p><p>
You will remember that I had left the camp with occupation sufficient to employ them for three or four days, after which they were to 
follow me down the river. Within that time I had expected the relief from King, if it was to come at all. 
</p><p>
They remained where I had left them seven days, and then started down the river. Manuel - you will remember Manuel, the Cosumne Indian - gave way to a feeling of despair after they 
had travelled about two miles, begged Haler to shoot him, and then turned and made his way back to the camp ; intending to die there, as he 
doubtless soon did. They followed our trail down the river, - twenty-two men they were in all. About ten miles below the camp. Wise gave out, threw away his gun and blanket, and 
a few hundred yards further fell over into the snow and died. Two Indian boys, young men, countrymen of Manuel, were behind. They 
rolled up Wise in his blanket and buried him in the snow on the river bank. No more died that day, - none the next. Carver raved during the night, his imagination wholly occupied with 
images of many things which he fancied himself eating. In the morning, he wandered off from the party, and probably soon died. They did not see him again. Sorel on this day gave 
out and laid down to die. They built him a fire, and Morin, who was in a dying condition, and snow-blind, remained. These two did not 
probably last till the next morning. That evening, I think, Hubbard killed a deer. They travelled on, getting here and there a grouse, 
but probably nothing else, the snow having frightened off the game. Things were desperate, and brought Haler to the determination 
of breaking up the party, in order to prevent them from living upon each other. He told them " that he had done all he could for them, 
that they had no other hope remaining than the expected relief, and that their best plan was to scatter and make the best of their way in small 
parties down the river. That, for his part, if he was to be eaten, he would, at all events, be found travelling when he did die." They accordingly separated. With Mr. Haler continued 
five others and the two Indian boys. Rohrer now became very despondent ; Haler encouraged him by recalling to mind his family, and urged him 
to hold out a little longer. On this day he fell behind, but promised to overtake them at evening. Haler, Scott, Hubbard, and Martin agreed that if any one of them should give out, the 
others were not to wait for him to die, but build a fire for him and push on. At night Kern's mess encamped a few hundred yards from Haler's, with the intention, according to Taplin, 
to remain where they were until the relief should come, and in the mean time to live upon those who had died, and upon the weaker ones as they should die. With the three Kerns were 
Cathcart, Andrews, McKie, Stepperfeldt, and Taplin. 
</p><p>
Ferguson and Beadle had remained together behind. In the evening Rohrer came up and remained with Kern's mess. Mr. Haler learnt 
afterwards from that mess that E-ohrer and Andrews wandered off the next day and died. They say they saw their bodies. In the morning 
Haler's party continued on. After a few hours Hubbard gave out. They built him a fire, gathered him some wood, and left him, without, 
as Haler says, turning their heads to look at him, as they went off. About two miles further, Scott - you remember Scott, who used to shoot 
birds for you at the frontier - gave out. They did the same for him as for Hubbard, and continued on. In the afternoon the Indian boys 
went ahead, and before nightfall met Godey with the relief. Haler heard and knew the guns which he fired for him at night, and, starting 
early in the morning, soon met him. I hear that they all cried together like children. Haler turned back with Godey, and went with him to 
where they had left Scott. He was still alive and was saved. Hubbard was dead, - still warm From the Kern's mess they learned the death 
of Andrews and Rohrer, and a little above met Ferguson, who told them that Beadle had died the night before. 
</p><p>
Godey continued on with a few new Mexicans and pack mules to bring down the baggage from the camp. Haler, with Martin and 
Bacon, on foot, and bringing Scott on horseback, have first arrived at the Red River settlement. Provisions, and horses for them to ride, 
were left with the others, who preferred to rest on the river until Godey came back. At the latest, they should all have reached Red River 
settlement last night, and ought all to be here this evening. When Godey arrives I shall know from him all the circumstances sufficiently 
in detail to enable me to understand clearly every thing. But it will not be necessary to tell you any thing further. It has been sufficient 
pain for you to read what I have already written. 
</p><p>
As I told you, I shall break up my party here. I have engaged a Spaniard to furnish mules to take my little party with our baggage, as 
far down the Del Norte as Albuquerque. Tomorrow a friend sets out to purchase me a few mules, with which he is to meet me at Albuquerque, and thence I continue the journey on 
my own animals. My road will take me down the Del Norte, about 160 miles below Albuquerque, and then passes between this river 
and the heads of the Gila, to a little Mexican town called I think Tusson. Thence to the mouth of the Gila, and across the Colorado, 
direct to Agua Caliente, into California. I intend to make the journey rapidly, and about the middle of March ; hope for the great pleasure of hearing from home. I look for a large 
supply of newspapers and documents, more perhaps because these things have a home look about them than on their own account. When 
I think of you all, I feel a warm glow at my heart, which renovates it like a good medicine, and I forget painful feelings in strong hope for 
the future. We shall yet, dearest wife, enjoy quiet and happiness together - these are nearly one and the same to me now. I make frequently pleasant pictures of the happy home we 
are to have, and oftenest and among the pleasantest of all I see, our library with its bright fire in the rainy stormy days, and the large 
windows looking out upon the sea in tiie bright weather. I have it all planned in my own mind. It is getting late now. La Harpe says that there are two gods which are very dear 
to us, Hope and Sleep. My homage shall be equally divided between them ; both make the time pass lightly until I see you, and so I go now to pay a willing tribute to the one, with 
my heart full of the other. Good-night.
