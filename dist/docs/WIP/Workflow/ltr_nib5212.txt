Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . The truth is simply this. The Bank is doing very 
well. During my connection of six years with it, I have 
never seen its affairs in so satisfactory a state, as at the 
present moment. It will have certainly have earned during the last six months more than three per cent. But then I am 
clearly of opinion that we should never advance our rate 
of dividend, till we are perfectly satisfied that we will never 
have occasion to diminish it. In Jany. <a href='/results.php?year=1823'>1823</a>, we began with 
out one dollar in our pockets and we have been trying 
ever since to accumulate a fund in reserve, so as to equalize 
our dividends. You may be very sure of two things : in the 
first place that no determination with regard to the next 
Dividend has been generally formed, &amp; in the second place 
that whatever that Dividend may be the succeeding dividend will be at least as much. . . .
