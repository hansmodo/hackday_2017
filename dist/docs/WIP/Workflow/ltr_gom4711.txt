My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I shall write but a few lines by this conveyance. The re 
sources of this country will hold out till the end of April next, 
but then things will appear in a situation truly deplorable. 
Orders are given to push into Spain with all the force which 
can be collected. The object is to obtain a separate peace. 
Attempts will be made also to obtain peace with Savoy and 
Italy. These failing, to supply the south with food is impossible. Spain offered peace some time ago, but met with a 
contemptuous refusal. As yet the enemy seem to be unacquainted with the true state of things. I am, &c.
