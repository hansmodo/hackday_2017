My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . Mr. c Lanes report is all that his friends could 
wish enlarged liberal, wise, &amp; statesmanlike. It is much 
fitter for a President's message than the President's message 
itself &amp; I wish with all my heart that the writer of it was 
President. The style of the paragraph in that message about 
the Bank, with the commentary of the Globe, the <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> 
Enquirer, &amp; the Standard, I confess shake my confidence 
much. It is not in such an ambiguous tone that a President 
should speak or make his dependants speak.
