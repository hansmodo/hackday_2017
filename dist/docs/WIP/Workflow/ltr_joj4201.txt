I thank you cordially, my good and constant friend, for 
your letter of the 25th ult. It affords me no little gratification. We grow old, but our hearts retain their warmth. 
</p><p>
The perversion and obliquity you notice has not been 
recent nor unexpected. Men who are ardent in the pursuit of influence and its fruits, and more attentive to the 
prosecution than to the propriety of their schemes, usually 
become and remain hostile to those who steadfastly disapprove of their manoeuvres. Instead of regulating their hostility by truth and candour, they generally find it convenient to recur to perversion and obliquity. 
</p><p>
The conventional statement to which you allude, was 
doubtless devised and formed, in the manner which its projectors deemed to be best accommodated to the objects they 
had in view. So many years have elapsed since the negotiations at Paris, that only a few individuals among the 
present members of any oi our popular assemblies, probably 
possess ample and accurate knowledge of those negotiations. 
</p><p>
On considering your hint of my making some statement 
of facts relative to them, in addition to my letter to Congress, which, you observe, may (like the papers of the war 
office) be accidentally destroyed, I think that precaution 
will not be necessary. I have a honk in which are i 
that and all my other official letters to Congress. 
</p><p>
An accurate and well-written history of the United States, 
down to the conclusion of the late war, is desirable. But 
my expectations on that head are not sanguine. Time is 
daily obscuring and diminishing the materials, and the task 
becoming more and more difficult. The marks of talent 
and rectitude which appear in the Life of Washington, by 
Judge Marshall, have induced me to regret that he had 
not commenced such a history, and incorporated that life 
in it. The mass of information he has collected continues 
to afford facilities for such a work, and it would more than 
answer the purpose of a new edition of the other. Whoever may undertake it, would, in my opinion, do well to 
give it the advantage of frequent revision, and postpone the 
publication until a period when the events and circumstances related in it, had ceased to produce personal and 
political excitement. 
</p><p>
I rejoice in your continuing to enjoy good health. I will 
not say with the Spaniards, "may you live a thousand 
years;" for that would postpone greater blessings. The 
name and character of Judge Washington interest me in his 
welfare. I hope he will be restored to health. The prevailing disease which attacked him, I suspect, was the 
same which visited us â€” influenza. Few families here 
escaped. I have had it, but not severely: it has left a 
cough, which still gives me some trouble. Although too 
feeble to go often beyond the piazza, yet I experience no 
depression of spirits, nor frequent returns of acute pain. 
Here also the distress of the times is felt very sensibly. 
Habits of expense, unproductive speculations, and debts 
injudiciously contracted, press hard both upon debtors and 
creditors. How long this state of things will continue, 
or how much good or evil will eventually result from it, 
cannot now be calculated. They who hope for the best 
and prepare for the worst, will doubtless mitigate some of 
their troubles, and probably obviate the occurrence of some 
others. 
</p><p>
God bless you, my dear sir. 
</p><p>
Yours, affectionately,
