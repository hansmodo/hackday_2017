Agreeably to my promise, my dear Sir, I write 
you from this place, and flatter myself with the hope 
that, although my letter contains no important intelligence, yet it may not be unpleasing to you.

Your calm retreat of <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> must be a 
source of ineffable delight to you. You can from 
thence take a retrospective view of the critical exigencies of the w^ar, and see a thousand ways by 
which the issue might have been the reverse of what 
it is. And your happiness must be in proportion to 
the extreme difficulties and dangers of the contest, 
and the immense blessings secured to your country 
by the glorious peace, contrasted with the miseries 
consequent upon an unfortunate termination.

We have little or no politics; all commerce frozen 
up by the uncommon severity of the season ; but better prospects in the spring. There are now upon the 
stocks, in different parts of the State, for the fisheries 
and other branches of trade, upwards of eight hundred vessels, which will be at sea early in the summer.

New Hampshire and this State have come into the 
impost exactly as proposed by Congress; and it appears to be pretty certain that Rhode Island and 
Connecticut will be induced to come into it. Many 
sensible men are for the powers of the Union being 
high braced ; but no measures are proposed to effect it.

The <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a> appears, however groundlessly, to 
be an object of jealousy. The idea is that it has 
been created by a foreign influence, in order to change our forms of government. And this opinion 
is strengthened by a letter from one of our Ministers 
abroad. Burke's pamphlet has had its full operation. 
The cool, dispassionately sensible men seem to approve 
of the institution generally, but dislike the hereditary 
descent. The two branches of the Legislature of this 
State, namely, the Assembly and Senate, have chosen 
a Committee, " to inquire into any associations or 
combinations to introduce undue distinctions into the 
community, and which may have a tendency to create 
a race of hereditary nobility, contrary to the Confederation of the United States, and the spirit of the 
Constitution of this Commonwealth." They have not 
yet reported, and perhaps 'they will not. The same 
sentiments pervade New England. The Society here 
have had a respectable meeting in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, on the 
10th instant, at which <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> presided. <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a> w^as not present. A Committee was 
chosen to attend the general meeting at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
next day ; â€” General R. Putnam, Colonel Cobb, Lieutenant-Colonel Hull, Major Sargent and myself Probably only two will attend. It was thought prudent 
not to make any honorary members at present. The 
officers and soldiers conduct themselves in an exemplary manner, and are generally as industrious as any 
part of the community.

I wrote your Excellency from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> on the 
3d ultimo, inclosing the returns, and a particular account of matters there, which I hope met your approbation. And I also wrote you a line on the 9th of 
the same month, the day I set out from thence. We 
reside at Dorchester, about five miles from town, in a 
very agreeable situation. I shall hope for the pleasure of hearing from you at your leisure. Mrs. Knox 
presents her sincere and ardent affection to Mrs. 
Washington, and proposes to write particularly to her 
soon; and I also beg my respectful compliments may 
be added. I am, my dear Sir, your truly

Respectful and affectionate, humble servant,
