Sir, 
</p><p>
I have revolved, with great attention, the matter 
of the letter which you yesterday did me the honor 
of confiding to my perusal. Convulsed as we are, I 
cannot but believe that there is scarcely a man in 
the Government, whom party will not, sooner or later, 
destine for an attack. A communication, therefore 
which seems even to be tinctured with particular objects, will naturally excite caution. I hope, however, 
that I shall not be understood to insinuate the most 
distant suspicion of that affectionate attachment which 
is professed ; for I am truly persuaded of it. I mean 
no more than that kind of caution which would prevent you from heartily acceding to, or rejecting, propositions so delicate in themselves. 
</p><p>
What is due to the French nation up to the close 
of <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>, ought, if practicable, to be paid to the existing authorities of France. This can never be questioned as to its validity or propriety, let the shape 
of their Government be what it will ; nor can it give 
just umbrage to any member of the hostile Confederacy. But, as this sum is probably far below the wishes of the French Minister, it will be asked 
whether the large advance of three million tournois can be made ; and, if it can, ought it to be made ? 
</p><p>
You informed me, Sir, that the ability of the treasury to accomplish this, depended upon the success 
of a bill now on its passage through the Legislature. 
Of course the United States are not yet in a capacity of advancing, unless the other advice be followed, 
of scrutinizing the Treasury Department, and thence 
discovering funds ; or of instituting a new loan. The 
former is in a train of being executed, and could not 
now be quickened. Should the Executive at this moment originate a similar investigation, it might look 
like something more than a neutrality between the 
parties. Possibly, at a future day, when the result of 
the Congressional inquiry shall be known, if it should 
not be satisfactory to you, you may deem it expedient to impart the nature of the information referred 
to in the letter to the Secretary of the Treasury. In 
the mean time, While Congress are still in motion on 
the subject of finance, I presume that the proposed 
alternative of a loan must be suspended. 
</p><p>
Let me next suppose, that money adequate to the 
advance was now in hand. Even the situation of 
France, with respect to other powers, is serious and 
important. A voluntary payment of what is not yet 
due, carries with it causes of jealousy. On the opposite side, threatened famine will, if not attempted 
to be averted, rouse the zealous partisans of French 
politics in America. Perhaps, too, it may deserve 
consideration, how far the opportunity of forming a 
close connection with the French republic may be 
lost or weakened by refusing to gratify it, and how 
far it may spread a favorable impression of the Federal Administration throughout the United States. 
Again ; should the advance be approved, the allied 
nations can well be told, if they remonstrate, that the 
danger of a famine was a leading motive. Should it 
be disapproved, the French will be conscious that they 
have no right to demand it, and that money cannot 
be furnished in republics at will, or in the same profusion as in monarchies. Upon the whole, I should be 
inclined to the advance, if it was easily within our 
reach. But I see no reason, nor a state of things 
sufficiently ripe, for deciding the question at this moment. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty, therefore, of suggesting, whether Mr. Ternaut may not be informed that the balance, 
up to the end of <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>, shall be paid, and that a definitive' answer, as to the residue of the requisition, 
will be given as soon as the fiscal arrangements of Congress shall be finished. Then, and not till then, will you be possessed of the facts, necessary in such 
a case ; then, and not till then, will you be able to avoid the appearance of sheltering one officer, or of countenancing his adversary. Mr. Ternant cannot but 
acquiesce in the fitness of the measure ; and it will be seen, by the gentleman who wrote the letter, that while you will not precipitate yourself into the steps 
recommended, you have marked out, in your own mind, a day, reasonably distant, for again calling the subject into view. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
