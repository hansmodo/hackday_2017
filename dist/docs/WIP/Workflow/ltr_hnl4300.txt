My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Although the exalted station, which your love of 
us and our love of you has placed you in, calls for 
change in mode of address, yet I cannot so quickly 
relinquish the old manner. Your military rank holds 
its place in my mind, notwithstanding your civic glory ; and, whenever I do abandon the title which used 
to distinguish you, I shall do it with awkwardness. 
</p><p>
The affectionate and decided regard, demonstrated 
to your person and character, on your tour to New 
York, has diffused pure and sincere joy among every 
class of people in the circle of my intelligence. Nor 
has any individual more heartily enjoyed the testimonials exhibited by my fellow-citizens than myself; because it manifests honor, truth, and gratitude in the 
body politic, and because such spontaneous and disinterested effusions of respect and attachment must 
convey a reward the most grateful of all others to your 
feelings. Having gone through your inauguration, 
and consequently in some degree shielded by the duties of office from the display of affection and respect, 
which your arrival in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must have produced, 
I venture to yield to the entreaties of my heart, often before resisted, to offer my congratulations on your 
auspicious acceptance of the administration of the National Government. My reluctance to trespass a moment on your time would have operated to a farther 
procrastination of my wishes, had not I been roused 
above every feeling of ceremony by the heart-rending 
intelligence, received yesterday, that your life was despaired of Had I had wings in the moment, I should 
have wafted myself to your bedside, only again to 
see the first of men ; but alas ! despairing as I was, from the account received, after tlae aMction of one 
day and night, was I made most happy by receiving 
a letter, now before me from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, announcing 
the restoration of your health. May Heaven preserve it! 
</p><p>
Next to the felicity of the nation, I confess I have 
no object more interesting to me than your health 
and happiness. I pray, as I ever have done, that 
your return to public life may be commensurate to 
your intentions and to our expectations. Greater 
good to the people of the United States cannot be 
asked for. To give complete success to your administration appears to me impracticable, unless national 
harmony is soon restored. The political schism, which 
divides our countrymen, is, I fear, deep planted in 
the minds of many leading characters ; and, however 
respect to a majority and affection to the President 
may quiet them now, yet, on the first inviting occasion, the spirit of opposition will show itself strongly. 
To deprive it of the means of operating with effect 
should be, I conceive, the leading object of the friends 
to government. It is practicable to prevent your enemy from injuring you, although it may be impossible to render him your friend. Therefore, instead of 
striving to court the good will of opposition, by improper concessions, I would disarm them, by complying with the rational views of the advocates for 
amendments spontaneously. The House of Representatives, to whom these remarks apply, if they follow 
the plan which seems to be contemplated by some of 
their members, will, I think, accomplish this great 
good. If it is not done under your auspices, it will 
never be effected ; and, if never effected, we shall be 
a divided, distressed people. 
</p><p>
Among the difficulties which encompass you, I presume those which flow from the nomination to office. 
will be the most irksome. The public good being 
your guide, all that you can want will be just information. Herein consists the danf>;er of committins; 
error, because you must unavoidably depend on the 
knowledge of others too often. When the commercial arrangements shall be settled, and it may become 
necessary to make the appointments, I beg leave to 
mention to you a young man of excellent private 
character, and brought up in the naval office, Mr. Richard Marshall Scott, of <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>, who wishes to 
continue in public employ. He is descended from 
poor though honest parents, and has no chance for success in his application but from his own merit. His 
character will bear the strictest scrutiny, and his conduct for seven vears in the office of South Potomac, 
as Deputy Naval Officer at the port of <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>, 
meets with unanimous applause from the merchants 
as well as from his superiors. 
</p><p>
Having touched on this delicate subject, I cannot 
help naming to you another gentleman, to whose 
character, in war and in peace, you are no stranger, 
and whose situation and manner of life seem to fit 
him for public employment. I mean Colonel Carrington. He dislikes to solicit for office, but I am persuaded would be happy in being honored with an 
appointment, whenever you should consider it proper 
to call him into service. I am sure you will consider 
these communications merely as information, and therefore they cannot be unacceptable to you. Will you 
be pleased to present Mrs. Lee and me in the most 
respectful manner to your lady, and to accept, Sir, a 
repetition of the unceasing respect and regard of 
your faithful and affectionate Friend and humble servant.
