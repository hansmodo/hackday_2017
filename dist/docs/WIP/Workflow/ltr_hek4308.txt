Sir, 
</p><p>
The serious crisis of affairs in which the United States are involved with the Creeks, requires that every honorable and probable expedient that can be 
devised should be used to avert a war with that tribe. The untoward circumstances of the case are such that no degree of success could render a war 
either honorable or profitable to the United States. 
</p><p>
Events may be expected soon to arise, which will interrupt the present tranquillity. The headlong passions of the young Creek warriors are too impetuous 
to be restrained by the feeble advice of the Chiefs, even supposing their authority exerted to that end. But, where the dispositions of the Creeks generally 
favorable to peace, the corrosive conduct of the lawless whites inhabiting the frontiers, may be supposed to bring on partial quarrels. These may be easily 
fomented, and the flame of war suddenly lighted up, without a possibility of extinguishing it, but by the most powerful exertions. 
</p><p>
A war with the Creeks, besides being attended 
with its own embarrassments, may lead to extensive 
and complicated evils. Part of the lower Creeks, or 
Seminoles, reside within the territory of Spain ; and 
a strong connection appears to subsist between the 
Creeks generally and the Colonies of East and West 
Florida, belonging to that power. In case of a war 
with the Creeks, and they should be pushed to take 
refuge within the limits of either of the aforesaid 
Colonies, the United States would be reduced to a 
most embarrassed predicament ; for they must either 
follow the Creeks, in order to extinguish the war, establish posts in their country, or retire. In the first 
case, they would seriously be embroiled with Spain ; 
in the second, the operation would be extremely hazardous and expensive ; in the third, the impression 
made would not be attended with permanent or adequate effects to the expense incurred by the expedition. 
</p><p>
This subject, therefore, in every point of view in 
which it can be placed, has an unfavorable aspect to 
the interests of the United States. Acting under this 
impression, my mind has been anxiously employed in 
endeavouring to avoid, if possible, so injurious an 
event. In examining the proposition of the late Commissioners, to send the draught of a treaty for the 
Creeks to sign, and, in case of their refusal, to declare war against them, it appears as if the measure 
proposed would inevitably precipitate an event, which 
it is the interest of the United States to avoid. For, 
if such treaty should be transmitted to the Creeks, 
with a declaration that they must receive and sign 
it, or war should ensue, it is highly probable that the 
latter event would take place, by an irruption of the 
Creeks long before the messenger would reach the 
seat of Government. 
</p><p>
In search of expedients to avert the evils impending on this subject, I have been led into repeated 
conversations with the <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Honorable Benjamin Hawkins</a>, Senator for North Carolina, who is well acquainted 
with the influential characters among the Creeks. He appears to entertain the opinion, pretty strongly, that 
the designs and character of Alexander McGillivray, the influential Creek Chief, are opposed to a war 
with the United States, and that he would, at this time, gladly embrace any rational mean that could 
be offered, to avoid that event. It seems probable to <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a>, arising from former intimations of McGillivray, that he might at this time be influenced 
to repair to the seat of the General Government, provided that every facility and security should be offered for that purpose. 
</p><p>
In maturely contemplating this idea of <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a>, and confiding in his knowledge and judgment of the character alluded to, I am inclined to conclude 
that it is an expedient deserving experiment, and that, let its success be what it may, the result cannot 
fail of being honorable to the United States. For it is proposed, although the overture shall have the aspect of a private transaction, yet that it shall have 
so much of the collateral countenance of Government as to convince Mr. McGillivray that he may safely confide in the proposition, as it relates to his own 
and the other Chiefs' personal security, until their return to their own country. 
</p><p>
I have shown <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a> the inclosed draft of a letter to Alexander McGillivray. It has received his 
approbation, and he is willing to copy and sign the 
same, adding thereto some circumstances relative to a 
former correspondence on some philosophical inquiries. 
</p><p>
The hearer of the letter ought to he a man of real 
talents and judgment. Although the ostensible object 
of his mission should be the charge of the letter, yet 
the real object should be much more extensive. He 
should be capable of observing the effects of the proposition on the mind of McGillivray and the other 
Chiefs. He should be of such character and manners 
as to insinuate himself into their confidence ; to obviate their objections to the proposition ; to exhibit, 
in still stronger colors than the letter, the ruinous 
effects of a war with the Creeks. In the prosecution of his designs he should not be in a hurry, 
but wait with attention and patience the symptoms 
of compliance ; confirm them in such dispositions ; 
and be calm and firm, when opposed. And if, after 
all his labors and exertions, he should fail of success, 
he should be capable of giving a clear narrative of 
the means he used, and the obstacles which prevented his success. On this person's negotiation would 
depend much blood and treasure ; and, in any event, 
the reputation of the United States. 
</p><p>
The object, therefore, of the mission would require 
an important character, who, although not invested 
with any apparently dignified public commission, ought 
to have such private powers and compensation as 
would be a sufficient inducement to a performance of 
the intended service. 
</p><p>
The time, which the proposed negotiation would require, might be four months, or one hundred and twenty days. If the compensation should be eight dollars a 
day, the amount would be nine hundred and sixty dollars. The expenses would probably amount to four 
hundred dollars in addition. Should several of the 
Chiefs repair to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the expenses for that purpose would amount, at least, to one thousand dollars ; 
so that the expense of one thousand three hundred and 
sixty dollars, at least, and perhaps two thousand three 
hundred and sixty, would be incurred by the proposed measure. And this sum would be independent 
of the probable expenses of presents, and returning 
the Chiefs to their own country, which would require 
a much larger sum. But there cannot be any doubt 
of the economy of the proposed application of the 
money herein required, when compared with the expense which must attend a war. 
</p><p>
The proposed experiment would probably be attended with either one or the other of the following 
consequences. 
</p><p>
First ; that it would be successful, and thereby prevent a war. For, most probably, if Mr. McGillivray 
and the other influential Chiefs should embrace the 
measure, and repair to the seat of Government, their 
dispositions would be sufiiciently pacific to conclude 
a treaty, especially as no terms, inconsistent with the 
principles of justice or humanity, would be imposed 
on them. 
</p><p>
Secondly; in case the proposition should be unsuccessful, the fair and honorable dispositions of the 
United States would be highly illustrated; and, however great the evils which might afterwards result 
from hostilities, the Executive Government would not 
in any degree be responsible for them. 
</p><p>
But, as this transaction may be liable to the most 
unworthy imputations, arising from some former local 
prejudices against <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a>, in consequence of his 
services and zeal for the honor and justice of the 
United States while a Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
it seems fair and reasonable that his conduct, in this 
instance, should receive its just approbation, and be 
shielded from all malevolence and misrepresentation. 
I have the honor, therefore, humbly to submit the measure herein proposed to your consideration. If you 
should be pleased to approve the principal parts thereof, your direction appears to be essential on the following points. 
</p><p>
First ; your approbation of my request to <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a>, in writing, to copy and sign the letter to Alexander McGillivrav. 
</p><p>
Secondly; an ample passport for the protection of 
Mr. McGillivray, and such Chiefs as shall accompany 
]iim, from the time of their entering the limits of the 
United States to their return to their own country. 
</p><p>
Thirdly; a direction to me to make the necessary 
expenditures of money in pursuance of the plan proposed, and to appoint a suitable person to conduct 
the business. I have the honor to be. Sir, with the 
greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
