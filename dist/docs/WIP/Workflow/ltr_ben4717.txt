DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I duly received your favours of August 22, September 20, 
and October 8, and within these few days one of February 14, 
recommending Mr. Morgan Edwards and his affair of the 
Rhode Island College, which I shall endeavour to promote, 
deeming the institution one of the most catholic and generous 
of the kind. 
</p><p>
I am inclined to think with you that the small sum you have issued to discharge the public debts only will not be materially 
affected in its credit for want of the legal tender, considering 
especially the present extreme want of money in the province. 
You appear to me to point out the true cause of the General distress, viz. the late luxurious mode of living introduced by 
a too great plenty of cash. It is indeed amazing to consider, 
that we had a quantity sufficient before the war began, and 
that the war added immensely to that quantity, by the sums 
spent among us by the crown, and the paper struck and issued 
in the province ; and now in so few years all the money spent 
by the crown is gone away, and has carried with it all the gold 
and silver we had before, leaving us bare and empty, and at 
the same time more in debt to England than ever we were ! 
But I am inclined to think, that the mere making more money 
will not mend our circumstances, if we do not return to that 
industry and frugality, which were the fundamental causes of 
our former prosperity. I shall nevertheless do my utmost 
this winter to obtain the repeal of the act restraining the legal 
tender, if our friends the merchants think it practicable, and 
will heartily espouse the cause ; and, in truth, they have full 
as much interest in the event as we have. 
</p><p>
The present ministry, it is now thought, are likely to continue at least till a new Parliament ; so that our apprehensions 
of a change, and that Mr. Grenville would come in again, seem 
over for the present. He behaves as if a little out of his head 
on the article of America, which he brings into every debate 
without rhyme or reason, when the matter has not the least 
connection with it; thus at the beginning of this session on 
the debate upon the King's speech, he tired everybody, even 
his friends, with a long harangue about and against America, 
of which there was not a word in the speech. Last Friday he 
</p><p>
produced in the House a late <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Gazette, which he said 
denied the legislative authority of Parliament, was treasonable, rebellious, &c., and moved it might be read, and that 
the House would take cognizance of it, but it being moved on 
the other hand that Mr. G's motion should be postponed to 
that day six months, it was carried without a division: and 
as it is known that this Parliament will expire before that 
time, it was equivalent to a total rejection of the motion. 
The Duke of B. too, it seems, moved in vain for a consideration of this paper in the House of Lords. These are favourable symptoms of the present disposition of Parliament 
towards America, which I hope no conduct of the Americans 
will give just cause of altering. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to present my best respects to the House, and 
believe me with sincere esteem and regard, dear Sir, your 
affectionate friend and most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
