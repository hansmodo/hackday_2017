"When an opportunity offers, however little I have 
to communicate, my desire of conversing with you 
leads me to take up the pen at all events even tho the 
impossibility of giving you information upon public 
and more interesting objects should confine me to the 
old family style of I continue in good health as I hope 
you do, etc. 
The northern intelligence which was accidentally 
handed to us yesterday, but which you no doubt have 
received in proper form, is subject matter for congratulation. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to felicitate you upon the victory gained 
over the haughty <a href="/results.php?tla=jhb" rel="adversary">Burgoyne</a>, a victory which derives 
much of its importance from the critical time in which it happened. It was announced to the American prisoners in Howe's possession by a flag that happened 
to be going in yesterday. After all my good intentions I am obliged to break off abruptly, as Mr . Harrison 
the bearer hurries me, and my letter will serve only to inclose one left here yesterday for <a href="/results.php?tla=ccp" rel="met co-worker">Col. Pinckney</a>. 
</p><p>
Yours affection'y
