Sir, 
</p><p>
A number of the principal people of this country 
made application to me, about two weeks since, for 
my consent to their collecting a body of volunteers 
to go against Sandusky, which I agreed to on these 
express conditions; â€” that they did not mean to extend 
their settlements, nor had any thing in view but to 
harass the enemy, with an intention to protect the 
frontier, and that any conquests they might make 
should be in behalf and for the United States; that 
they would be governed by military laws as militia; 
that they must collect such numbers as might probably be successful ; and, lastly, that they would equip 
themselves and victual at their own expense. They 
are accordingly assembling this day at the Mingo 
bottom, all on horseback, with thirty days' provision. 
They have asked of me only a few flints, and a small 
supply of powder. 
</p><p>
As they will elect their officers, I have taken some 
pains to get Colonel Crawford appointed to command, 
and hope he will be. He left me yesterday, on his 
way down to the place of rendezvous. He does not 
wish to go with a smaller number than four hundred; 
whether this number will assemble, I cannot say. He 
pressed me for some officers. I have sent with him 
Lieutenant Rose, my Aid-de-camp, a very vigilant, 
active, brave, young gentleman, well acquainted with 
service ; and a surgeon. These two are all I could 
venture to spare. Several were solicitous for my going, but I did not think myself at liberty, consistent 
with the spirit of your Excellency's instructions ; nor 
are we in such a situation that I could take a single 
Continental soldier along, particularly as the volunteers are all mounted. If their number exceeds three 
hundred, I am of opinion they may succeed, as their 
march will be so rapid they will probably, in a great 
degree, effect a surprise. 
</p><p>
I cannot find a man in This country, who has a 
tolerable knowledge of the road to Niagara. There 
are numbers who are acquainted to the heads of Alleghany; from thence I think the people of the State 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> are better acquainted than any this 
way. I have the honor to be, with perfect respect, 
Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wli" rel="me">William Irvine</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The volunteers have sent requesting my instructions (which I will send) for the officer who may 
be appointed to command. The troops behave remarkably well, since a few examples have been made.
