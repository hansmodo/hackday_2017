Sir, 
</p><p>
At the request of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Governor Jefferson</a>, I have already 
given orders to the commandant at <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> to afford 
you every assistance in his power, in the prosecution of 
your intended expedition. A few days ago I received 
a piece of intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, which it may 
be material for you to know. It is, that Colonel Connolly, who formerly lived upon the Ohio, who was 
taken in the year 1775, and lately exchanged, is to 
proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, as soon as the season will permit, 
with as many refugees as he can collect at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; 
that he is to join Sir John Johnson in Canada; and 
that they are to proceed, with their united forces, by 
the route of Birch Island and Lake Ontario to Venango. Their object is to be <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> and the western posts. It is also said, that Connolly carries blank 
commissions, which are to be given to persons already 
in the country, and that there are several hundred 
persons now in the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, who 
are to join him. As this last corresponds with a suspicion, which <a href='/results.php?tla=dab' rel='co-worker'>Colonel Brodhead</a> entertains, I have written to him to take measures to secure or remove 
every suspected person. I am. Sir, &c.
