DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
An accident, which has very seldom happened to 
me in the course of thirty years business, has deprived me of the honor of making an earlier, and 
puts it out of my power even now to make a more 
proper acknowledgment of three of your Excellency's 
favors, which I remember to have been indebted for, 
antecedent to the receipt of this of the 3d instant, 
which now lies before me. Those, in removing my 
desks and their contents from one part of the house 
to a more convenient, I have mislaid among my private papers, and, after as much search at different 
times, and particularly this morning, as the fleeting 
and pressing moments which I dare borrow from 
public attentions have permitted me to make, remain 
undiscovered, although I am sure they are safe in a 
wrong class. 
</p><p>
I recollect, however, and shall never forget, a new 
obligation, which, in one of them, your Excellency 
was pleased to lay on me by a very kind notice of 
my son's behaviour at Rhode Island, and that you 
had returned the gold which I sent to head-quarters, 
by Jones, and also the letters of Governor Johnstone, 
Mr. Oswald, and Mr. Manning. In the present circumstances of Great Britain, rendered deplorable by 
the waste of another campaign on this Continent, by 
the loss of Dominique, in the West Indies, and of a great marine battle at her own doors, it is exceedingly difficult to determine what will be her next 
step, although I do not think it is to see the only 
measures remaining for her salvation. 
</p><p>
With respect to South Carolina, I cannot yet treat 
the idea of an attack, as altogether chimerical. I 
am well warranted to say the British Administration 
held that State and Georgia in reserve, for a stroke 
of necessity, which might, at any time, be made with 
success, and they well know the immense value of 
those States, and great things may be done by drawing their forces to one point. They may, indeed, 
have stayed a day too late. Be that as it will, I 
have fully advertised my countrymen; and, if the 
alarm, shall prove to have been unnecessarily sounded, 
their intermediate exertions towards a defence will 
do them no real injury. Congress have ordered the 
proceedings of the Court-Martial on Major-General 
St. Clair to be printed, and have appointed Friday, 
the 16th, for considering and determining on those 
of the Court on Major-General Lee. 
</p><p>
I have nothing further to offer at present, Sir, but 
the repeated assurances of being, with the highest 
sense of esteem and respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
