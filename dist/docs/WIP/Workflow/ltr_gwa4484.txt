Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The freedom of your communications is highly pleasing to me. The portrait you have drawn of our affairs is strictly agreeable to the life, and you do me 
but justice m supposing, that my mind is fortified 
against, or rather prepared for, the most distressing 
accounts that can be given of them. It would not be 
the part of friendship, therefore, to conceal any circumstance, from an unwillingness to give pain, especially as the knowledge of it, to a man determined not 
to smk under the weight of perplexities, may be of 
the utmost importance. But we must not despair ; the 
game is yet in our own hands ; to play it well is all 
we have to do, and I trust the experience of error 
will enable us to act better in future. A cloud may 
yet pass over us, individuals may be ruined, and the 
country at large, or particular States, undergo temporary distress ; but certain I am, that it is in our power 
to bring the war to a happy conclusion. 
</p><p>
My public letters to Congress, and in a more especial manner my private communications to Governor Rudedge, will bring you fully acquainted with the situation of things in this quarter, and the prospects before us. How far we shall be able to extricate ourselves from the former, and realize the latter, time only can show. I have great expectations from the 
appointment of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, but they are not unreasonable ones; for I do not suppose, that by any magic art he can do more than recover us by degrees from the labyrinth into which  our finances are plunged. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry for the disagreeable situation of our suffering soldiery at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and wish they could 
be relieved without adding to the pressure under which we at present groan. How far it is in <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>'s power to liberate, by exchange, our prisoners in that 
quarter I know not ; but he has all the authority I can give to do this, reserving the troops of convention from 
his disposal. With those I have trouble enough. In a late interview between the two commissaries of prisoners, Mr. Loring refused to exchange <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, unless the prisoners taken at the Cedars are 
allowed for, which is opposed by a resolve of Congress ; and he has actually refused to pay a debt of privates, which three months ago he promised to do. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &,c.
