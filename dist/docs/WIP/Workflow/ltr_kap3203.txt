SIR, 
</p><p>
Without going into a detailed history of my life, 
which would be too long, it will suffice to say to 
you, in the language of an old soldier and of a 
citizen, that, in coming to America, my sole object 
has been to devote myself entirely to her welfare 
and glory, in using every exertion in my individual 
power to secure her freedom. 
</p><p>
I think the nation was satisfied of my sentiments 
when it saw that I accepted the post of Brigadier General of cavalry, though a long service, and my 
former rank of Commander-in-chief of the army of 
Poland, had given me a right to expect a higher position. But the sole desire to distinguish myself by 
my zeal in the cause of the United States, has disposed me to sacrifice my repose and my life to its 
support, at all times, and in whatever position. I 
venture to flatter myself, Sir, that my conduct at the 
head of the cavalry has proved this to the complete 
satisfaction of the people and the Honorable Congress ; 
happy, General, if I may now be assured of that confidence, on your part, to which I aspire, and if, as I 
hope, you will honor with your approbation a plan 
which I have conceived with a sole view to the 
public good. Here it is, just as I have conceived it 
to be best adapted to benefit the army and the 
public. 
</p><p>
The corps placed under my command shall be in 
dependent, and formed of the two companies of 
horse and of six companies of infantry. If the Board 
of War, on which it will depend, shall see fit to en 
large it, on seeing, by experience of its courage and 
conduct, that it might be thus made of greater utility, it will be for them to decide. 
</p><p>
The duty of the Commandant-m-chief of this corps 
will be always to observe, very close at hand, all the 
movements of the enemy ; to take upon himself different enterprises, of the nature of surprises, ambuscades, affairs of posts, rear-guards, protecting flanks, 
&c., and to advise the Commander-in-chief of the 
army, and the Board of War, of every thing which 
he shall find to be of interest. It is easy to see 
that the whole system of the Commander of such a 
corps is simply one of active operation. So that, 
without enlarging on the advantages to be derived 
from it, it is easy to see that a corps which shall 
have no other object than to surprise the enemy, to 
watch them incessantly, and attack them at all points 
by continual surprises, must be of great utility. 
</p><p>
The corps will be recruited from the people of the 
country, from deserters, and from prisoners of war, 
agreeably to the letter of General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
I would propose, for my subaltern, an experienced 
officer, by name Kow r acz, formerly a Colonel and partisan in the Prussian service. And as my plan is to 
employ all the other officers whom I personally know 
to be capable of serving with distinction and honor, 
after obtaining the consent of the Honorable Congress for the execution of the plan, I shall have the 
honor to mention them. 
</p><p>
The muskets for the infantry, the pistols for the 
lancers, the sabres, and the horses, to be furnished 
me as soon as possible. I will undertake to execute 
the rest; and as it is difficult to find leather for 
boots, saddles, &c., I request an order upon the Commissary of Leather to furnish it to me, and upon the 
different Commandants where my recruits may be, for 
quarters and rations. 
</p><p>
I hope that the instructions may be such, that one third of the cost of equipping the corps may be furnished at once ; another third, in proportion as the 
corps is filled up ; and so on. 
</p><p>
You enjoy, General, the most distinguished, estimation in our army. I reverence your virtue and your valor; and your military knowledge gives me a 
confident hope, in presenting this view, of the success 
of a plan which is only interesting to me through 
my desire to make myself useful to the nation. 
</p><p>
I hope, General, that you will do me the favor to 
obtain a prompt decision.
