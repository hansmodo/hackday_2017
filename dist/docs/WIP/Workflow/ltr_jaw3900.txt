MY DEAR : 
</p><p>
I have nothing more than I have enclosed of the 1st instant. As to the news, our army is very strong, and in high spirits. There was a 
probability of an action the other day, and it appeared to be the hearty desire of every man to come to action j but it was not thought expedient 
by the General, and we returned to camp. We are now laying in camp, where I expect to lay for several days. As to particulars, I refer 
you to Major Gillam. I desire that Daniel will use his utmost endeavors to have the mills in the best order against harvest.'t was 
speaking to him in regard to trying to plant that field over the road in corn; but that I submit to him, and he may do as he pleases. I hope 
that the utmost care will be taken by him to save the crop that is planted. My wagon that I rode in with, is at Ninety-Six; send Daniel 
to bring it home, and have it put under a shed. I purpose to sell it 
when I return home. I desire you, my dear, to send me about half-apound of cloves and cinnamon by Major Gillam; what I brought I have 
used, and find it a great help to me. The water fs so bad that I make as little use of it as possible. Major Gillam has corne to bring a relief 
for the men that are here. If it is possible, I should be glad that you could send me an under jacket, for the two that I brought with me are breaking before. 
</p><p>
I am, dear wife, with respect, your ever loving husband till death,
