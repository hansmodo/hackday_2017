MR. LOTHROP called here this evening, and brought 
me yours of the 1st of October ; a day which will 
ever be remembered by me, for it was the most distressing one I ever experienced. That morning I rose, 
and went into my mother's room, not apprehending her so near her exit ; went to her bed with a cup of tea in my hand, and raised her head to give it to her. 
She swallowed a few drops, gasped, and fell back upon her pillow, opening her eyes with a look that 
pierced my heart, and which I shall never forget ; it was the eagerness of a last look ; 
</p><p>
" And O, the last sad silence of a friend." 
</p><p>
Yet she lived till five o'clock that day, but I could not be with her. My dear father prayed twice be 
side her bed that day. God Almighty was with him and supported him that day, and enabled him to go 
through the services of it. It was his communion day ; he had there a tender scene to pass through, a 
young granddaughter, Betsey Cranch, joining herself to the church, and a beloved wife dying, to pray for. 
Weeping children, weeping and mourning Parishioners all round him, for every eye streamed, his own 
heart almost bursting as he spoke. How painful is the recollection, and yet how pleasing ! 
</p><p>
I know I wound your heart. Why should I? Ought I to give relief to my own by paining yours? 
</p><p>
"Yet the grief, that cannot speak, 
Whispers the o erfraught heart, and bids it burst." 
</p><p>
My pen is always freer than my tongue. I have 
written many things to you that I suppose I never 
could have talked. My heart is made tender by 
repeated affliction ; it never was a hard heart. The 
death of Patty came very near me, having lived 
four years with me under my care. I hope it will 
make me more continually mindful and watchful of 
all those who are still committed to my charge. 
T is a great trust ; I daily feel more and more of the 
weight and importance of it, and of my own inability. 
I wish I could have more of the assistance of my 
dearest friend, but these perilous times swallow him up.

Mr. Lothrop has given me this account of the demand upon Falmouth. A man-of-war and two tenders went down, and sent to the inhabitants to demand 
their arms, and require them to stand neuter. They 
required time to consider ; they had until nine o'clock 
the next day, which time they employed in removing the women, children, and the rest of their most 
valuable effects, out of danger, when they sent their 
answer in the negative. Upon this, the enemy began a cannonade, and were continuing it when the 
express came away. Hitchbourne and another gentleman got out of town in a small boat, one of the 
foggy nights we have had this week. I have not 
heard what intelligence he brings. Another person 
says, that Howe enlarged all the prisoners but Lovell and he would not come out. 
</p><p>
I have since seen the Paraphrase, as it is called; 
but t'is as low as the mock oration, though no reflection upon your private character, further than 
immoderately whipping your scholars when you kept 
school ; a crime any one will acquit you of who 
knows you. As a specimen of the wit and humor it 
contained, I will give you the title. "A Paraphrase 
upon the Second Epistle of John the Roundhead, to 
James, the Prolocutor of the Rump Parliament. Dear 
Devil," &c. J had it, but it was when I was in so 
much distress that I cared nothing about it. I will 
mention, when I see you, the foolish conjectures of 
some, who want always to be finding out something 
extraordinary in whatever happens. 
</p><p>
I hope to hear often from you, which is all the 
alleviation I have in your absence, and is, next to 
seeing you, the greatest comfort of your
