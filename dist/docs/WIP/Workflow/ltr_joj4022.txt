Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The questions contained in your favour of the — : — April 
instant are as imj he .manner of introducing them is delicate. 
</p><p>
While the maritime affairs of the continent continue 
under the direction of they will be exposed to 
</p><p>
all the con qu ;nc s of want of system, ittenl on, and 
knowledge. The marine commitl :e com; d ■ • gate

from each State; it fluctuates; new members constantly 
coming in, and old ones going out ; three or four, indeed, 
have remained in it from the beginning ; and few members 
understand even the state of our naval affairs, or have 
time or inclination to attend to them. But why is not this 
system changed 1 It is, in my opinion, inconvenient to the 
family compact. The commercial committee was equally 
useless. A proposition was made to appoint a commercial 
agent for the States under certain regulations. Opposition 
was made. The ostensible objections were various. The 
true reason was its interfering with a certain commercial 
agent in Europe and his connexions.

You will, if I am not greatly mistaken, find Mr. Gerard disposed to be open and communicative. He has acquired an 
extensive knowledge of our affairs ; I have no reason to 
believe he will use it to our prejudice. There is as much 
intrigue in this State-house as in the Vatican, but as little 
secrecy as in a boarding-school. It mortifies me on this occasion to reflect that the rules of Congress on the subject of 
secrecy, which are far too general, and perhaps for that 
reason more frequently violated, restrains me from saying 
twenty things to you which have ceased to be private. 
</p><p>
The state of our currency is really serious. When or 
by what means the progress of the depreciation will be 
prevented, is uncertain. The subject is delicate, but the 
conduct of some men really indicates at least great indifference about it. It will not be many days before measures 
having a great, though not immediate influence on this subject, will be either adopted or rejected. I shall then have 
an opportunity of being more particular. 
I am, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
With perfect esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
