I HAVE but little news to write you. Every thing of 
that kind you will learn by a more accurate hand 
than mine. Things remain in much the same situation here, that they were when you went away. 
There has been no descent upon the seacoast. 
Guards are regularly kept ; and people seem more 
settled, and are returning to their husbandry. I feel 
somewhat lonely. Mr. Thaxter is gone home. Mr. 
Rice is going into the army, as captain of a company. We have no school. I know not what to do 
with John. As government is assumed, I suppose 
courts of justice will be established, and in that case, 
there may be business to do. If so, would it not be 
best for Mr. Thaxter to return? They seem to be 
discouraged in the study of law, and think there never will be any business for them. I could have 
wished they had consulted you upon the subject, before you went away.

I suppose you will receive two or three volumes 
of that forlorn wretch Hutchinson's letters. Among 
many other things, I hear he wrote, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1772">1772</a>, that 
Deacon Phillips and you had like to have been 
chosen into the Council, but, if you had, you should 
have shared the same fate with Bowers. May the 
fate of Mordecai be his. There is nobody admitted 
into town yet. I have made two or three attempts 
to get somebody in, but cannot succeed ; so have not 
been able to do the business you left in charge with 
me. I want very much to hear from you, how you 
stood your journey, and in what state you find your 
self now. I felt very anxious about you ; though I 
endeavoured to be very insensible and heroic, yet 
my heart felt like a heart of lead. The same night 
you left me, I heard of Mr. Quincy's death, which, 
at this time, was a most melancholy event ; especially, 
as he wrote in minutes, which he left behind, that 
he had matters of consequence intrusted with him, 
which, for want of a confidant, must die with him.
I went to see his distressed widow last Saturday, at 
the Colonel's ; and, in the afternoon, from an alarm 
they had, she and her sister, with three others of the 
family, took refuge with me and tarried all night. 
She desired me to present her regards to you, and let you know, she wished you every blessing, should 
always esteem you, as a sincere friend of her deceased husband. Poor afflicted woman ; my heart was 
wounded for her. I must quit the subject, and entreat 
you to write me by every opportunity.

Yours,
