Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When I wrote you last, I did not expect to address you from this place again ; but Colonel Carrington has detained me upwards of a week, to complete 
the business of his department. On Thursday next 
we set off, by land, for the northward. 
The Assembly of this State have rejected the impost act recommended by Congress. Had your circuLar, letter been printed a fortnight earlier, I am 
persuaded it would have brought them into the measure. On once reading in the House, it produced an 
alteration of sentiment of more then one quarter of 
the members. The force and affection, with which it 
was written, made every one seem to embrace it with 
avidity. You were admired before ; you are little less 
than adored now. The recommendation of Congress 
had but a feeble influence until it was supported by 
yours. Although the State did not come into the 
plan recommended by Congress, they have laid a tax 
of five per cent., under the authority of the State, to 
be solely for the Continental use. This I attribute 
entirely to your letter. Its effects have been astonishing. 
</p><p>
I see, by the papers, the Northern army does not 
choose to be furloughed. The people here begin to 
be alarmed at it. I hope every thing will terminate 
both for the honor of the army and satisfaction of 
the people, notwithstanding. There have been several little mobs and riots lately in this town, owing 
to the indiscretion of some of the British merchants, 
and to the violence of temper and private views of 
some of the Whig interest. Tranquillity now prevails, 
and there is little probability of any further disturbances. I hope to be at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> in about 
three weeks ; but, from all I can learn of the northern affairs, there is little probability of my having 
the pleasure of meeting your Excellency there. Present me, respectfully, to Mrs. Washington, if with 
you, and to all the firmily. I am, with esteem and 
affection. 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
