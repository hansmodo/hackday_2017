I thank you, my dear Meade, for your letter of the first 
of this month, which you will perceive has travelled much 
faster than has been usual with our letters. Our correspondence hitherto has been unfortunate, nor in fact can 
either of us compliment himself on his punctuality ; but you 
were right in concluding, that however indolence or accident may interrupt our intercourse, nothing will interrupt 
our friendship. Mine for you is built on the solid basis of 
a full conviction that you deserve it, and that it is reciprocal, and it is the more firmly fixed, because you have few 
competitors. Experience is a continued comment on the 
worthlessness of the human race, and the few exceptions 
we find, have the greater right to be valued in proportion as 
they are rare. I know few men estimable, fewer amiable, and when I meet with one of the last description, it is 
not in my power to withhold my affection. 
</p><p>
You reproach me with not having said enough about our 
little stranger. When I wrote last, I was not sufficiently 
acquainted with him to give you his character. I may now 
assure you, that your daughter, when she sees him, will not 
consult you about the choice, or will only do it in respect 
to the rules of decorum. He is truly a very fine young gentleman, the most agreeable in his conversation and manners 
of any I ever knew, nor less remarkable for his intelligence 
and sweetness of temper. You are not to imagine, by my 
beginning with his mental qualifications, that he is defective in personal. It is agreed, on all hands, that he is handsome ; his features are good, his eye is not only sprightly 
and expressive, but it is full of benignity. His attitude, in 
sitting is, by connoisseurs, esteemed graceful, and he has a 
method of waving his hand that announces the future orator. He stands, however, rather awkwardly, and as his 
legs have not all the delicate slimness of his father's, it is 
feared he may never excel as much in dancing, which is 
probably the only accomplishment in which he will not be 
a model. If he has any fault in manners, he laughs too 
much. He has now passed his seventh month. 
</p><p>
I am glad to find your prospect of being settled approaches. I am sure you will realize all the happiness you 
promise yourself with your amiable partner. I wish fortune 
had not cast our lots at such a distance. Mrs. Meade, you, 
Betsey, and myself, would make a most affectionate and 
most happy partie quarre. 
</p><p>
As to myself, I shall sit down in New-York, when it 
opens, and the period we are told approaches. No man 
looks forward to a peace with more pleasure than I do, 
though no man would sacrifice less to it than myself, if I 
were not convinced the people sigh for peace. I have been 
studying the law for some months, and have lately been 
licensed as an attorney. I wish to prepare myself by October for examination as a counsellor, but some public avocations may possibly prevent me. 
I had. almost forgotten to tell you, that I have been pretty 
unanimously elected by the legislature of this state, a member of congress, to begin to serve in November. I do not 
hope to reform the state, although I shall endeavour to do 
all the good I can. 
</p><p>
Suffer Betsey and me to present our love to Mrs. Meade. 
She has a sisterly affection for you. My respects, if you 
please, to Mr. and Mrs. Fitzhugh. God bless you.
