SIR, 
</p><p>
The retreat of the Northern army, and its present 
situation, have spread a general alarm. By intelligence from Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, received last-evening, I have reason to conclude that they are 
now at Crown Point and <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, in a weak 
state, and under the necessity of an immediate re-enforcement, to enable them to make a stand, and 
prevent the enemy from passing the Lake and penetrating into the country. The prevalence of the 
smallpox among them is every way unhappy. Our 
people, in general, have not had that distemper. Fear 
of the infection operates strongly to prevent soldiers 
from engaging in the service, and the battalions ordered to be raised in this Colony fill up slowly; and 
though no measures be taken to remove the impediment, may not the army be soon freed from that infection ? Can the reinforcements be kept separate 
from the infected ? Or may not a detachment be 
made from the troops under your command and the 
militia raising in the several Colonies and ordered to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, of such men as have had the smallpox, 
to be replaced by the troops raising for the Northern 
Department? Could any expedient be fallen upon, 
that would afford probable hopes that this infection 
may be avoided, I believe our battalions would soon 
join the Northern army. I shall omit nothing in my 
power to expedite them. 
</p><p>
The retreat of the army from Canada exposes the 
Northern frontiers of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and New Hampshire 
to the ravages of the Indians, who will doubtless be 
spirited up to fall upon them. Some of the settlements on Onion River, I am informed, are breaking 
up and removing, and the whole filled with the 
most disquieting apprehensions. Some powder and 
lead, upon application, have been supplied them from 
this Colony ; but the settlers there, from their infant 
state, and consequent poverty, are unable to devote themselves to the defence of the frontiers, unless they should be enabled to hire laborers to carry on 
the business of their farms in their absence. I 
could therefore wish, that your Excellency might 
think proper to recommend it to the Continental 
Congress, to order a battalion to be raised and stationed there, for the defence of those settlements. It 
would, I trust, be immediately filled up with a hardy 
race of men in that quarter, well adapted to repel 
the attacks of the savages, and ready to join and 
support the Northern army, upon occasion, and at 
all times may scour the woods, and furnish intelligence of the enemy's motions. 
</p><p>
If those settlers are driven back, besides the loss 
of their property, a much heavier expense will fall 
upon some of the Colonies for the support of their 
families, than the charges arising from the raising 
and maintaining a battalion of Continental troops ; and 
we shall still have a frontier to defend. 
</p><p>
The anxiety of the friends and relations of many, 
if not most, of those settlers who emigrated from this 
Colony, and the importance of the matter, will, I 
trust, be my sufficient apology for wishing to engage 
your influence with Congress, to support the motion 
I judge advisable and shall make, to have a battalion 
raised out of, and stationed on, those frontiers. 
</p><p>
By a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, of the 1st in 
stant, received last evening, I am advised that Generals Schuyler, Gates, and Arnold, were to set out on 
Tuesday morning. I trust they are by this time at 
the end of their journey, and hope their presence 
may have a happy effect towards retrieving affairs in 
that quarter. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
