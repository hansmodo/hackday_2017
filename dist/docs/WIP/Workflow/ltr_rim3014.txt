DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mr. Melchior, I sent express to <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a> for artillery stores. Be so good as to give him all the assistance in 
your power, particularly in money matters. Yesterday we opened 
a battery of five guns and a howitzer, and, with very little effect, 
I attempted to summon the Governor by a flag of truce. He 
would not receive any letter. The enemy have very heavy 
metal, and I think will dismount our guns very shortly. Some 
they have already rendered almost useless. This gives very little 
uneasiness ; I never expected any other advantage from our artillery, than to amuse the enemy, and blind them as to my real intention. 
</p><p>
I propose, the first strong northwester, to make two attacks by 
night, one with about a third of the troops on the Lower Town, 
having first set fire to some houses, which will in all probability 
communicate their flames to the stockade lately erected on the 
rock, near St. Roc suburbs; the other upon Cape Diamond bastion, by escalade. I have not time to point out my reasons for 
this particular attack. Let it suffice that it is founded on the 
nature of the ground, works, and the best intelligence I have been 
able to procure. However, I am not certain whether or no the 
troops relish this mode of proceeding. I am fully convinced of the 
practicability. But should it not appear in the same advantageous 
light to the men, I shall not press it upon them, well knowing 
the impossibility of making troops act with the necessary vigor, 
on such an occasion, if their minds are possessed with imaginary terrors . 
</p><p>
We are exceeding weak, it is true, but the enemy are so too, 
in proportion to the extent of their works ; and as they know 
not where they will be attacked, all must be guarded. Indeed, 
their apprehensions for the Lower Town, induce them to bestow 
their greatest attention on that quarter. I hope the arms, lead, 
and flints are on their way. I could wish for a reinforcement, 
if to be spared. We have not much above eight hundred men 
fit for duty, exclusive of a few ragamuffin Canadians. 
</p><p>
I believe you will not think it proper to let the contents of this 
letter go abroad. Should you have no accounts of any cash on 
the way, I must beg you will send an express to hasten it. I 
shall soon be exceedingly distressed, if a supply don t arrive. I 
must therefore beg you to raise what you can, for fear of accidents. Let a considerable number of shirts be sent down as 
soon as possible. Our men are much in want of them. I must 
refer you to Mr. Melchior for particulars. Believe me, dear Sir, 
with much esteem, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant,
