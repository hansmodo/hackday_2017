DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My last Expedition convinced me that I grow too old for 
Rambling, and that 'twas probable I should never make such 
another Journey. 'Tis an uncomfortable Thing, the Parting with Friends one hardly expects ever again to see. This, 
with some occasional Hindrances, prevented my calling at 
Preston Field after my Return from Glasgow: But my 
Heart was with you and your dear Family, and my best 
Wishes attended you all. Sir John Pringle rejoic'd with me 
on the Account I gave him of the Recovery of your Health, 
which I pray God may long continue. Pray present my 
respectful Compliments to Lady Dick, & to Miss Dick. 
Many happy New Years to you & all yours. I am, with the 
sincerest Esteem, Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN
