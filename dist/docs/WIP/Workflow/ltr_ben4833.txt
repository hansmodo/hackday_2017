MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I have written several short Letters to you lately just to let 
you know of my Welfare, and promising to write more fully 
by Capt. Falconer, which I now sit down to do, with a Number of your Favours before me. I received the Box & Letter 
from Mr. Peter Miller, but if as you mention, Enoch Davenport brought it, I did not see him. Perhaps he might call 
while I was absent in Ireland. I write by this Opportunity 
to Mr. Miller. What he sent me is a most valuable Curiosity. I take notice of the considerable Sums you have 
paid. I would not have you send me any Receipts. I am 
satisfy'd with the Accounts you give. 
</p><p>
I am much pleas'd with your little Histories of our Grand
son, & happy in thinking how much Amusement he must 
afford you. I pray that God may continue him to us, & to 
his Parents. Mr. Bache is about returning. His Behaviour 
here has been very agreable to me. I have ad vis' d him to 
settle down to Business in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where I hope he will 
meet with Success. I mentioned to you before, that I saw 
his Mother and Sisters at Preston, who are genteel People, 
and extreamly agreable. 
</p><p>
I receiv'd your young Neighbour Haddock's Silk, and 
carried it myself to her Relations, who live very well, keeping 
a Linnen-Draper's Shop in Bishop's-Gate Street. They have 
a Relation in Spitalfields that is a Manufacturer who I 
believe will do it well. I shall honour much every young 
Lady that I find on my Return Dress'd in Silk of their own 
raising. I thank you for the Sauceboats, and am pleas'd to 
find so good a Progress made in the China Manufactury. I 
wish it Success most heartily. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Stevenson too loves to hear about your little Boy. 
Her own Grandson (my Godson) is a fine Child, now nine 
Months old. He has an attentive, observing, sagacious 
Look, as if he had a great deal of Sense, but as yet he is not 
enough acquainted with our Language to express it intelligibly. His Mother nurses him herself, for which I much 
esteem her, as it is rather unfashionable here ; whence Numbers of little Innocents suffer and perish. His Name is 
William. Mr. and Mrs. Strahan & their Family are well. 
We din'd there not long since. Yesterday Mrs. Stevenson, 
her Daughter, Mr. Bache, and myself, din'd at Mr. West's. 
They are well and their fine Boy. 
</p><p>
I am pleas'd that the Letters between me and the good 
Lady entertain'd you. But you ought not to have shown 
them to any body but Sally. Since my Return I receiv'd 
the enclosed ; but having too much to do, I could not accept 
the kind Invitation. 
</p><p>
The Squirrels came safe and well. You will see by the 
enclosed how welcome they were. A 1000 Thanks are sent 
you for them, and I thank you for the Readiness with which 
you executed the Commission. 
</p><p>
My Love to our dear precious Policy Hunt & all our kind 
enquiring Friends. Mrs. Montgomery's Health is I hope 
established, as also that of our Dear Friend Rhoads and his 
Family. The Buckwheat and Indian Meal are come safe & 
good. They will be a great Refreshment to me this Winter. 
For since I cannot be in America, every thing that comes 
from thence comforts me a little, as being something like 
Home. The dry'd Peaches too are excellent, those dry'd 
without the Skin: The Parcel in their Skins are not so 
good. The Apples are the best I ever had and came with the 
least Damage. The Sturgeon you mention did not come: 
but that is not so material. 
</p><p>
I hope our cousin Tyler will do well among us. He seems 
a sober well inclin'd Man ; and when I saw him at Birmingham, he appeared to be well respected by his Relations and 
Friends. An active, lively industrious Wife would be a good 
Thing for him. I grieve for our Friend Bond's heavy Loss ; 
and am sorry for poor Dr. Kearsley's misfortune. I sent 
you from Ireland a fine Piece of the Holland of that Country. 
Capt. All, whom I met with there, found a Captain that he 
knew who promis'd to take care of it and deliver it safe. 
You mention nothing of it in your Letter of Decem r 2. when 
in the common Course you ought to have had it before that 
time, which makes me fear it is lost. I wrote to you from 
</p><p>
Dublin; and from Glasgow in Scotland. I was in Ireland 
about 7 Weeks, in Scotland about 4 Weeks, absent from 
London in all more than three Months. My Tour was a 
very pleasant one. I received abundance of Civilities from 
the Gentry of both those Kingdoms, and my Health is improv'd by the Air & Exercise. 
</p><p>
I have advis'd Mr. Bache to deal only in the Ready Money 
Way, tho' he should sell less. It is the safest and the most 
easy Manner of carrying on Business. He may keep his 
Store in your little North Room, for the present. And as he 
will be at no Expence while the Family continues with you, 
I think he may, with Industry and Frugality, get so forward, 
as at the end of his Term, to pay his Debts and be clear of 
the World, which I much wish to see. I have given him ^200 
SterPg to add something to his Cargo. My Love to our dear 
Sally, and to Ben. concludes at present, from Your ever affectionate Husband 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
