DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
By an express from Major Clark, stationed at 
Dobbs's Ferry, I find the enemy are encamped right 
opposite, to the number of between three and four 
thousand ; and the Major adds, from their disposition 
and search after boats, they design to cross the river. 
A frigate and two transports or provision-ships passed the chevaux-de-frise night before last. They were 
prodigiously shattered, from the fire of our cannon. 
The same evening, Colonel Tupper attempted passing  the ships with the petiaugres, loaded with flour. 
The enemy manned several barges, two tenders, and 
a row-galley, and attacked them. Our people ran 
the petiaugres ashore, and landed and defended them. 
The enemy attempted to land several times, but 
were repulsed. The fire lasted about an hour and a 
half, and the enemy moved off. Colonel Tupper still 
thinks he can transport the provision in flat-bottomed 
boats. A second attempt shall be speedily made. 
We lost one man, mortally wounded.

General Mercer writes me the Virginia troops are coming on. They are now at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. He proposes an attack on Staten Island; but the motions of the enemy are such I think it necessary for them to  come forward as fast as possible. On York Island, 
the enemy have taken possession of the hill, next to Spiten Devil. I think they will not be able to 
penetrate any farther. There appears to be about fifteen hundred of them. From the enemy's motions, 
I should be apt to suspect they were retreating from your army, or at least altering their operations. Mr. Lovell, who is at last enlarged from his confinement, 
reports that Colonel Allen, his fellow prisoner, was informed that transports were getting in readiness to sail, at a moment's warning, sufficient to transport fifteen thousand men.

The officers of Colonel Hand's regiment are here, with enlisting orders. The officers of the Pennsylvania regiments think it a grievance (such of them 
as are commissioned for the new establishment), that officers of other regiments should have the privilege of enlisting their men before they get orders. I 
have stopped it until I learn your Excellency's pleasure. Governor Ewing is very much opposed to it. 
You will please to favor me with a line on the subject, I am, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
