My dear Sally, 
</p><p>
Having a few leisure hours allotted, me by this day of 
general rest, I shall divide them between Heaven and yourself ; being persuaded that while I do my duty to both, my 
expectations of happiness will not be vain. 
</p><p>
When I consider that one of the reasons assigned for the 
creation of woman was, " that it is not good for man to be 
alone," I find my present situation condemned, not only by 
my own feelings, but by divine authority. I assure you, 
I am tired of it ; and, were there not many reasons to conjecture that the enemy will bend their course this way, we 
should not remain much longer separated ; but, as it would 
be cruel to expose you to scenes of anxiety and distress, I 
must endeavour to bear your absence at least with patience, 
and to please myself with the expectation of shortly seeing 
the return of those happy days, when we shall again " sit 
under our own vine, and under our own fig-tree, and there 
be none to make us afraid." 
</p><p>
As soon as the Council of Safety dissolves, which will be 
at the meeting of the Legislature, you may expect to see 
me for a few days ; but when that event will take place is 
uncertain. Should this State become the seat of war, and 
be attacked on both sides, it will not be practicable to convene the Legislature, nor indeed would it be proper for me, 
in such a conjuncture, to be absent. 
As the enemy are now expelled from Jersey, and Liberty 
Hall is again free, I fancy Susan has become as joyous as 
ever, and that the whole family arc not a little anxious to 
put an end to their exile. 
</p><p>
I returned last Wednesday from <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. My father 
declines fast. His late loss affects him exceedingly ; he 
gives way to silence and retirement, spending hours every 
day in that melancholy room ; and though he appears calm 
and resigned, the effects of this inauspicious event are visible upon him. How few possess such sensibility, or are 
capable of affections so permanent and so delicate ! 
</p><p>
Whenever leisure and opportunity offer, remember, my 
dear Sally, how acceptable a line from you always is to 
Your very affectionate husband, 
</p><p>
