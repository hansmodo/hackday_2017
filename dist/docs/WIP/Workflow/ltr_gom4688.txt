Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I transmit to you enclosed a letter received open from Mr Cathalan, who has been disappointed in giving the needful 
surety for the due execution of his office, by the delay of his letters during the seige of Lyons, and other circumstances resulting from local situation. It seems probable that my corres ondence with him may be soon cut off, for if the French ar 
my does not speedily get possession of Toulon, I. think they 
will be obliged to abandon the enterprise, from the difficulty 
of obtaining subsistence. In that case Marseilles will fall of 
course, as well as the county of Nice, which has already cost 
much blood and treasure. 
</p><p>
The insurgents of Vendee, who had broken into Lower Normandy, seem to have divided themselves into various bands, 
and to have been attended with a varied success ; but, on the 
whole, the theatre of their operation is considerably extended, 
and we may hourly expect- to hear that they have received 
considerable reinforcements by sea. I persist in believing that 
to be the tender part of the French Republic, for many things 
concur to show, that a very large portion of the people are 
disposed to a counter revolution ; but they dare not stir until 
a sufficient force shall appear ; for they are without arms, or 
union, or any means of understanding each other, while the 
examples are so striking and terrifying, that every individual, 
whatever may be his political tenets, trembles at the exercise 
of that authority which, whether willingly or unwillingly is a 
matter of indifference, he contributes to support. 
</p><p>
Since my last, the new organization, or rather regulation, of 
the government system has taken place ; but, to my poor conception, it appears as inefficient and as discordant as ever. If 
I am not mistaken, it must soon undergo farther changes. 
</p><p>
I enclose also herein a copy of my letter of the ninth to the 
Minister, by which you will observe that I endeavor to obtain, 
by a sense of their own interest, the release of our ships from 
the harbor of Bordeaux, since the sense of justice has not yet 
produced the effect. To reason at a distance, and in generals, 
it would seem almost impossible that this outrageous grievance 
should be continued ; but yet I do not dare to flatter myself 
with the removal of it. The Representatives of the people 
sent into the departments are vested with unlimited power. In 
the exercise of it they suspend decrees of the Convention, fine, 
imprison, in short, do everything, which to them appears needful for the public safety. They assign their reasons after 
wards, if called on by the Convention for that purpose. But 
it seems to be understood, that their acts must not be reversed 
until after their return, unless they should indeed be charged 
as contre-revolutionaires, and then everything is overturned. 
</p><p>
I need not dwell on such a state of things, for you will 
readily draw all the perplexing and vexatious consequences. 
Happy they, who contemplate them at a distance. A view of 
what our countrymen suffer in this respect so torments me, 
that it is very difficult to be patient. I am, &c.
