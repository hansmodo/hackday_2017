SIR: 
</p><p>
Gen. Barn well having desired to retire from the command of the 
brigade to which he has been appointed, and, as I think the service 
would be best promoted by its being continued under the command of 
a Brigadier, in preference to the regiments being independently commanded by the Colonels, I, therefore, desire you would take the command of that brigade, and consider it as annexed to the brigade at 
present commanded by you : until you receive orders to the contrary 
from me, or the Commander-in-Chief of this State, for the time being, 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
