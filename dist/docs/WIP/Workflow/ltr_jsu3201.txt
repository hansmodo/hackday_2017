MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Nothing can be more painful to me, than the repetition of a request, which is known to be disagreeable to a Commander, to whom America in general, 
and myself in particular, stand so much indebted. 
After so polite a refusal as I have once had, I should 
have remained forever silent upon the subject, did 
not pure necessity, which knows no law, compel me 
to repeat my request. I sincerely lament my being 
compelled to discover my situation and my feelings, 
and hope that a long silence upon the subject will 
be looked upon by your Excellency rather as evidence of patience, than as a mark of my having the 
gift of complaining without cause. I shall repeat 
facts. 
</p><p>
When Britain first began to send troops to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
I began, at great expense, to manoeuvre troops as well 
in the eastern part of Massachusetts as in our own 
State. This not only occasioned a loss of time, but 
the loss of money was inevitable. I then served the 
public part of two years in Congress. Between the 
sessions of Congress I undertook to dismantle the 
fort at Piscataway. The Continent have received and 
used the cannons, small arms, powder, &c., which were, 
at my expense, removed into the country, at the distance of a number of miles, for which I have never 
had the least reward, nor have I the least probability 
of it. Since I have been in the service I have been 
rather unfortunate. I have been robbed at Long Is 
land, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, New Rochelle, and at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. The 
last of these losses I never suspected, till I was on 
my return from New England, and had arrived within a mile of the place. I lost, at those several times, ten 
suits of clothes complete, a large quantity of linens, 
all my camp equipage, a valuable military library, 
&c. &c. I have, notwithstanding, weathered out the 
campaign, but have neither clothes nor equipage to 
begin another, or money to purchase. I have lost 
three horses in the service, which I am not able to 
replace ; and though one of them was killed in action, 
and the others in different service, Congress will 
make no recompense. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, I have but two ways 
left. One is to quit the service entirely, and the 
other, to quit it for a season, to prepare myself for 
greater fatigue and losses. I need not mention to 
your Excellency how inadequate the eight 
allowed by Congress, is to the support of an officer; 
my first letter has hinted it ; I am sure your Excellency can see the justice of the hint. I have mentioned two ways of relief for myself. My first letter 
has shown the necessity, as well as a letter I wrote 
to Colonel Harrison, from <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, in June last. 
Could I be permitted to have my choice, it would be 
the former, as I have suffered too much and received 
too little for the fatigue I have endured. If this 
can be procured without trouble to your Excellency, 
and without my incurring your Excellency's censure, 
it will much oblige, dear General, him that is, with 
every sentiment of gratitude and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
