Sir,
</p><p>
As the dangers which threaten our western frontiers, the ensuing spring,
render it necessary that we should send thither Colonel Crocket's
battalion, at present on guard at Fredericktown, but raised for the
western service, I thought it necessary to give your Excellency previous
information thereof, that other forces may be provided in time to
succeed to their duties. Captain Read's troop of horse, if necessary,
may be continued a while longer on guard.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,
</p><p>
your Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
