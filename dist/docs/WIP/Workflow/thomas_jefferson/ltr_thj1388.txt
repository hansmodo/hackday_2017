TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.

</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
The enclosed letter will inform you of the arrival of a British fleet in
Chesapeake bay.
</p><p>
The extreme negligence of our stationed expresses is no doubt the cause
why, as yet, no authentic account has reached us of a general action,
which happened on the 15th instant, about a mile and a half from
Guilford Court House, between <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel=''>General Greene</a> and Lord Cornwallis.
Captain Singleton, an intelligent officer of Harrison's artillery, who
was in the action, has this moment arrived here, and gives the general
information that both parties were prepared and desirous for action;
the enemy were supposed about twenty-five hundred strong, our army about
four thousand. That after a very warm and general engagement, of about
an hour and a half, we retreated about a mile and a half from the field,
in good order, having, as he supposed, between two and three hundred
killed and wounded, the enemy between five and seven hundred killed and
wounded: that we lost four pieces of artillery: that the militia, as
well as regulars, behaved exceedingly well: that <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel=''>General Greene</a>, he
believes, would have renewed the action the next day, had it not proved
rainy, and would renew it as soon as possible, as he supposes: that the
whole of his troops, both regulars and militia, were in high spirits and
wishing a second engagement: that the loss has fallen pretty equally on
the militia and regulars: that General Stevens received a ball through
the thigh.
</p><p>
Major Anderson, of Maryland, was killed, and Captain Barrett, of
<a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met">General Washington's</a> cavalry; Captain Fauntleroy, of the same cavalry, was shot
through the thigh, and left in the field.
</p><p>
Captain Singleton, having left the camp the day after the battle, does,
not speak from particular returns, none such having been then made. I
must inform your Excellency from him, till more regular applications can
reach you, that they are in extreme want of lead, cartridge-paper, and
thread. I think it improper, however it might urge an instantaneous
supply, to repeat to you his statement of the extent of their stock of
these articles. In a former letter, I mentioned to you the failure of
the vein of our lead mines, which has left the army here in a state of
equal distress and danger.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with very high respect and esteem,
</p><p>
your Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
</p><p>

P. S. Look-out boats have been ordered from the sea-board of the eastern
shore, to apprise the Commander of the French fleet, on its approach, of
the British being in the Chesapeake. T. J.
