Sir,
</p><p>
I gave you information in my last letter, that <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker'>General Greene</a> had
crossed the Dan, at Boyd's Ferry, and that Lord Cornwallis had arrived
at the opposite shore. Large reinforcements of militia having embodied
both in front and rear of the enemy, he is retreating with as much
rapidity as he advanced; his route is towards Hillsborough. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker'>General Greene</a> re-crossed the Dan on the 21st, in pursuit of him. I have the
pleasure to inform you, that the spirit of opposition was as universal,
as could have been wished for. There was no restraint on the numbers
that embodied, but the want of arms.
</p><p>
The British at Portsmouth lie close in their lines. The French squadron
keep them in by water, and since their arrival, as they put it out of
the power of the enemy to cut off our retreat by sending up Nansemond
river, our force has been moved down close to their lines.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,
</p><p>
your most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
