Sir,
</p><p>
I have just received intelligence, which, though from a private hand,
I believe is to be relied on, that a fleet of the enemy's ships have
entered Cape Fear river, that eight of them had got over the bar,
and many others were lying off; and that it was supposed to be a
reinforcement to Lord Cornwallis, under the command of General Prevost.
This account, which had come through another channel, is confirmed by a
letter from General Parsons at Halifax, to the gentleman who forwards it
to me. I thought it of sufficient importance to be communicated to your
Excellency by the stationed expresses. The fatal want of arms puts it
out of our power to bring a greater force into the field, than will
barely suffice to restrain the adventures of the pitiful body of men
they have at Portsmouth. Should any more be added to them, this country
will be perfectly open to them, by land as well as water.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with all possible respect,
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
