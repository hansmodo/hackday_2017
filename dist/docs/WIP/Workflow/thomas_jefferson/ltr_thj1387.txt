TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=Richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, March 19,<a href="/results.php?year=1781">1781</a>;
</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
I have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency a copy of a letter from
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker'>General Greene</a>, with some other intelligence received, not doubting your
anxiety to know the movements in the South.
</p><p>
I find we have deceived ourselves not a little, by counting on the whole
numbers of the militia which have been in motion, as if they had all
remained with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker'>General Greene</a>, when, in fact, they seem only to have
visited and quitted him.
</p><p>
The Marquis Fayette arrived at <a href="/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a> on the 15th. His troops still
remained at the head of the bay, till the appearance of some force which
should render their passage down safe.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and
respect, your Excellency's
</p><p>
most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
</p>
</letter>
