Sir,
</p><p>
I received yesterday your favor of the 8th instant, and this morning
went to Auteuil and <a href="/results.php?city=Passy" rel="city">Passy</a>, to consult with <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> and <a href="/results.php?tla=ben" rel="co-worker met">Benjamin Franklin</a>
on the subject of it. We conferred together, and think it is a case in
which we could not interpose (were there as yet cause for interposition)
without express instructions from Congress. It is, however, our private
opinion, which we give as individuals, only, that Mr. McLanahan, while
in England, is subject to the laws of England; that, therefore, he must
employ counsel, and be guided in his defence by their advice. The law
of nations and the treaty of peace, as making a part of the law of the
land, will undoubtedly be under the consideration of the judges who
pronounce on Mr. McLanahan's case; and we are willing to hope that, in
their knowledge and integrity, he will find certain resources against
injustice, and a reparation of all injury to which he may have been
groundlessly exposed. A final and palpable failure on their part, which
we have no reason to apprehend, might make the case proper for the
consideration of Congress.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of great respect and esteem, for
Mr. McLanahan, as well as yourself.
</p><p>
Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,
</p><p>
