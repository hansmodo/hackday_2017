Dear Sir,
</p><p>
I enclose you a letter from Gatteaux, observing that there will be
an anachronism, if, in making a medal to commemorate the victory of
Saratoga, he puts on <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker met'>General Gates</a> the insignia of the Cincinnati, which
did not exist at that date. I wrote him, in answer, that I thought so
too, but that you had the direction of the business; that you were now
in London; that I would write to you, and probably should have an answer
within a fortnight; and that, in the mean time, he could be employed on
other parts of the die. I supposed you might not have observed on the
print of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker met'>General Gates</a>, the insignia of the Cincinnati, or did not mean
that that particular should be copied. Another reason against it strikes
me. Congress have studiously avoided giving to the public their sense of
this institution. Should medals be prepared, to be presented from them
to certain officers, and bearing on them the insignia of the order, as
the presenting them would involve an approbation of the institution, a
previous question would be forced on them, whether they would present
these medals. I am of opinion it would be very disagreeable to them to
be placed under the necessity of making this declaration. Be so good as
to let me know your wishes on this subject by the first post.

<a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Short</a> has been sick ever since you left us. Nothing new has occurred
here, since your departure. I imagine you have American news. If so,
pray give us some. Present me affectionately to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> and the
ladies, and to Colonel Smith; and be assured of the esteem with which I
am, Dear Sir,
</p><p>
your friend and servant,
