TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.

Sir,
</p><p>
Circumstances of public duty calling me suddenly to London, I take
the liberty of mentioning it to your Excellency, and of asking a
few minutes' audience of you, at as early a day and hour as will be
convenient to you, and that you will be so good as to indicate them to
me. I would wish to leave <a href="/results.php?city=Paris" rel="city">Paris</a> about Friday or Saturday, and suppose
that my stay in London will be of about three weeks. I shall be happy to
be the bearer of any commands your Excellency may have for that place,
and will faithfully execute them. I cannot omit mentioning, how pleasing
it would be to me to be enabled, before my departure, to convey to the
American prisoners at St. Pol de Léon such mitigation of their fate, as
may be thought admissible.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and
esteem, your Excellency's
</p><p>
most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
