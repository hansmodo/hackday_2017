TO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.

<a href="/results.php?city=Paris" rel="city">Paris</a>,
</p><p>
June 16, <a href="/results.php?year=1785" rel='origin'>1785</a>.
</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving, the day before yesterday, the resolution
of Council, of March the 10th, and your letter of March the 30th, and
shall, with great pleasure, unite my endeavors with those of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel=''>Marquis De La Fayette</a> and Mr. Barclay, for the purpose of procuring the arms
desired. Nothing can be more wise than this determination to arm our
people, as it is impossible to say when our neighbors may think proper
to give them exercise. I suppose that the establishing a manufacture
of arms, to go hand in hand with the purchase of them from hence, is at
present opposed by good reasons. This alone would make us independent
for an article essential to our preservation; and workmen could probably
be either got here, or drawn from England, to be embarked hence.
</p><p>
In a letter of January the 12th, to Governor Harrison, I informed him of
the necessity that the statuary should see <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>; that we
should accordingly send him over unless the Executive disapproved of it,
in which case I prayed to receive their pleasure. Mr. Houdon being new
re-established in his health, and no countermand received, I hope this
measure met the approbation of the Executive: Mr. Houdon will therefore
go over with <a href="/results.php?tla=ben" rel="co-worker met">Benjamin Franklin</a>, some time in the next month.
</p><p>
I have the honor of enclosing you the substance of propositions which
have been made from London to the Farmers General of this country,
to furnish them with the tobacco of Virginia and Maryland, which
propositions were procured for me by the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel=''>Marquis De La Fayette</a>. I take
the liberty of troubling you with them, on a supposition that it may be
possible to have this article furnished from those two States to this
country, immediately, without its passing through the "entrepot"
of London, and the returns for it being made, of course, in London
merchandise. Twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco a year, delivered here
in exchange for the produce and manufactures of this country, many
of which are as good, some better, and most of them cheaper than in
England, would establish a rivalship for our commerce, which would have
happy effects in all the three countries. Whether this end will be best
effected by giving out these propositions to our merchants, and exciting
them to become candidates with the Farmers General for this contract, or
by any other means, your Excellency will best judge on the spot.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of due respect, your
Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
</p><p>
P.S. I have written on the last subject to the Governor of Maryland
also.
