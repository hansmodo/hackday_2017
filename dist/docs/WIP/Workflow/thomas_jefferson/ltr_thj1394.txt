Sir,
</p><p>
On the 18th instant, the enemy came from Portsmouth up James river, in
considerable force, though their numbers are not yet precisely known to
us. They landed at Burwell's Ferry, below <a href="/results.php?city=Williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, and also a
short distance above the mouth of Chickahominy. This latter circumstance
obliged Colonel Innis, who commanded a body of militia, stationed on
that side the river to cover the country from depredation, to retire
upwards, lest he should be placed between their two bodies. One of these
entered <a href="/results.php?city=Williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> on the 20th, and the other proceeded to a ship-yard
we had on Chickahominy. What injury they did there, I am not yet
informed. I take for granted, they have burned an unfinished twenty-gun
ship we had there. Such of the stores belonging to the yard as were
moveable, had been carried some miles higher up the river. Two small
galleys also retired up the river. Whether by this, either the stores
or galleys were saved, is yet unknown. I am just informed from a private
hand, that they left <a href="/results.php?city=Williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> early yesterday morning. If this
sudden departure was not in consequence of some circumstance of alarm
unknown to us, their expedition to <a href="/results.php?city=Williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> has been unaccountable.
There were no public stores at that place, but those which were
necessary for the daily subsistence of the men there. Where they mean
to descend next, the event alone can determine. Besides harassing our
militia with this kind of war, the taking them from their farms at the
interesting season of planting their corn, will have an unfortunate
effect on the crop of the ensuing year.
</p><p>
I have heard nothing certain of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker'>General Greene</a> since the 6th instant,
except that his head-quarters were on Little river on the 11th.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem,
</p><p>
your Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
