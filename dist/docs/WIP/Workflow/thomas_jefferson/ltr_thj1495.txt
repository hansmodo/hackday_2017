Dear Sir,
</p><p>
My last letters were of the 1st and 20th of September, and the 28th of
October. Yours, unacknowledged, are of August the 20th, October the
3rd, and November the 15th. I take this, the first safe opportunity, of
enclosing to you the bills of lading for your books, and two others for
your namesake of <a href="/results.php?city=Williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, and for the attorney, which I will pray
you to forward. I thank you for the communication of the remonstrance
against the assessment. Mazzei, who is now in Holland, promised me to
have it published in the Leyden gazette. It will do us great honor. I
wish it may be as much approved by our Assembly, as by the wisest part
of Europe. I have heard, with great pleasure, that our Assembly have
come to the resolution, of giving the regulation of their commerce to
the federal head. I will venture to assert, that there is not one of its
opposers, who, placed on this ground, would not see the wisdom of this
measure. The politics of Europe render it indispensably necessary, that,
with respect to every thing external, we be one nation only, firmly
hooped together. Interior government is what each State should keep to
itself. If it were seen in Europe, that all our States could be brought
to concur in what the Virginia Assembly has done, it would produce a
total revolution in their opinion of us, and respect for us. And it
should ever be held in mind, that insult and war are the consequences
of a want of respectability in the national character. As long as the
States exercise, separately, those acts of power which respect foreign
nations, so long will there continue to be irregularities committed
by some one or other of them, which will constantly keep us on an ill
footing with foreign nations.

I thank you for your information as to my Notes. The copies I have
remaining shall be sent over, to be given to some of my friends and to
select subjects in the College. I have been unfortunate here with this
trifle. I gave out a few copies only, and to confidential persons,
writing in every copy a restraint against its publication. Among others,
I gave a copy to a Mr. Williams: he died. I immediately took every
precaution I could to recover this copy. But, by some means or other, a
bookseller had got hold of it. He employed a hireling translator, and is
about publishing it in the most injurious form possible. I am now at
a loss what to do as to England. Every thing, good or bad, is thought
worth publishing there; and I apprehend a translation back from the
French, and a publication there. I rather believe it will be most
eligible to let the original come out in that country: but am not yet
decided.

I have purchased little for you in the book way since I sent the
catalogue of my former purchases. I wish, first, to have your answer to
that, and your information, what parts of these purchases went out of
your plan. You can easily say, Buy more of this kind, less of that, &c.
My wish is to conform myself to yours. I can get for you the original
<a href="/results.php?city=Paris" rel="city">Paris</a> edition of the Encyclopédie, in thirty-five volumes, folio, for
six hundred and twenty livres; a good edition, in thirty-nine volumes,
4to, for three hundred and eighty livres; and a good one, in thirty-nine
volumes, 8vo, for two hundred and eighty livres. The new one will be
superior in far the greater number of articles; but not in all. And the
possession of the ancient one has, moreover, the advantage of supplying
present use. I have bought one for myself, but wait your orders as to
you. I remember your purchase of a watch in <a href="/results.php?city=Philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. If it should
not have proved good, you can probably sell it. In that case, I can get
for you here, one made as perfect as human art can make it, for about
twenty-four louis. I have had such a one made, by the best and most
faithful hand in <a href="/results.php?city=Paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. It has a second hand, but no repeating, no day
of the month, nor other useless thing to impede and injure the movements
which are necessary. For twelve louis more, you can have in the same
cover, but on the back, and absolutely unconnected with the movements of
the watch, a pedometer, which shall render you an exact account of the
distances you walk. Your pleasure hereon shall be awaited.

Houdon has returned. He called on me, the other day, to remonstrate
against the inscription proposed for <a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met"><a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a></a>'s statue. He
says it is too long to be put on the pedestal. I told him, I was not at
liberty to permit any alteration, but I would represent his objection to
a friend, who could judge of its validity, and whether a change could be
authorized. This has been the subject of conversations here, and various
devices and inscriptions have been suggested. The one which has appeared
best to me, may be translated as follows: 'Behold, Reader, the form of
<a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met">George <a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met"><a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a></a></a>. For his worth, ask History; that will tell it, when
this stone shall have yielded to the decays of time. His country erects
this monument.' Houdon makes it.'This for one side. On the second,
represent the evacuation of <a href="/results.php?city=Boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, with the motto, 'Hostibus primum
fugatis.' On the third, the capture of the Hessians, with 'Hostibus
iterum devictis.' On the fourth, the surrender of York, with 'Hostibus
ultimum debellatis.' This is seizing the three most brilliant actions of
his military life. By giving out, here, a wish of receiving mottos for
this statue, we might have thousands offered, from which still better
might be chosen. The artist made the same objection, of length, to the
inscription for the bust of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De La Fayette</a>. An alteration of
that might come in time still, if an alteration was wished. However, I
am not certain that it is desirable in either case. The State of Georgia
has given twenty thousand acres of land, to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel=''>Count D'Estaing</a>. This
gift is considered here as very honorable to him, and it has gratified
him much. I am persuaded, that a gift of lands by the State of Virginia
to the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De La Fayette</a>, would give a good opinion here of our
character, and would reflect honor on the Marquis. Nor am I sure that
the day will not come, when it might be an useful asylum to him. The
time of life at which he visited America was too well adapted to receive
good and lasting impressions, to permit him ever to accommodate himself
to the principles of monarchical government; and it will need all his
own prudence, and that of his friends, to make this country a safe
residence for him. How glorious, how comfortable in reflection, will it
be, to have prepared a refuge for him in case of a reverse. In the
mean time, he could settle it with tenants from the freest part of this
country, Bretaigne. I have never suggested the smallest idea of this
kind to him: because the execution of it should convey the first notice.
If the State has not a right to give him lands with their own officers,
they could buy up, at cheap prices, the shares of others. I am not
certain, however, whether, in the public or private opinion, a similar
gift to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel=''>Count Rochambeau</a> could be dispensed with. If the State could
give to both, it would be better: but, in any event, I think they
should to the Marquis. <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel=''>Count Rochambeau</a>, too, has really deserved more
attention than he has received. Why not set up his bust, that of Gates,
Greene, Franklin, in your new capitol? "A propos" of the capital. Do, my
dear friend, exert yourself to get the plan begun on set aside, and that
adopted, which was drawn here. It was taken from a model which has been
the admiration of sixteen centuries; which has been the object of as
many pilgrimages as the tomb of Mahomet; which will give unrivalled
honor to our State, and furnish a model whereon to form the taste of our
young men. It will cost much less too, than the one begun; because it
does not cover one half of the area. Ask, if you please, a sight of
my letter of January the 26th, to Messrs. Buchanan and Hay, which will
spare me the repeating its substance here.

Every thing is quiet in Europe. I recollect but one new invention in the
arts which is worth mentioning. It is a mixture of the arts of engraving
and printing, rendering both cheaper. Write or draw any thing on a plate
of brass, with the ink of the inventor, and, in half an hour, he gives
you engraved copies of it, so perfectly like the original, that they
could not be suspected to be copies. His types for printing a whole
page, are all in one solid piece. An author, therefore, only prints a
few copies of his work, from time to time, as they are called for. This
saves the loss of printing more copies than may possibly be sold, and
prevents an edition from being ever exhausted.

I am, with a lively esteem, Dear Sir,
</p><p>
your sincere friend and servant,
