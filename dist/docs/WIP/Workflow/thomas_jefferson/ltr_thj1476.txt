Dear Sir,
</p><p>
I wrote to you on the 11th of October, by Mr. Preston, and again on
the 18th of the same month, by post. Since that, yours of September
the 25th, by Mr. Boylston, of October the 24th, November the 1st, and
November the 4th, have come safe to hand. I will take up their several
subjects in order. Boylston's object was, first, to dispose of a cargo
of spermaceti oil, which he brought to Havre. A secondary one, was to
obtain a contract for future supplies. I carried him to the <a href='/results.php?tla=wib' rel='colleague'>Marquis de la Fayette</a>. As to his first object, we are in hopes of getting the
duties taken off, which will enable him to sell his cargo. This has led
to discussions with the ministers, which give us a hope that we may get
the duties taken off in perpetuum. This done, a most abundant market for
our oil will be opened by this country, and one which will be absolutely
dependant on us; for they have little expectation themselves of
establishing a successful whale-fishery. It is possible they may
only take the duties off of those oils, which shall be the produce
of associated companies of French and American merchants. But as yet,
nothing certain can be said.
</p><p>
I thank you for the trouble you have taken to obtain insurance on
Houdon's life. I place the thirty-two pounds and eleven shillings to
your credit, and not being able, as yet, to determine precisely how our
accounts stand, I send a sum by Colonel Smith, which may draw the scales
towards a balance.
</p><p>
The determination of the British cabinet to make no equal treaty with
us, confirms me in the opinion expressed in your letter of October the
24th, that the United States must pass a navigation act against
Great Britain, and load her manufactures with duties, so as to give a
preference to those of other countries: and I hope our Assemblies will
wait no longer, but transfer such a power to Congress, at the sessions
of this fall. I suppose, however, it will only be against Great Britain,
and I think it will be right not to involve other nations in the
consequences of her injustice. I take for granted, that the commercial
system wished for by Congress, was such a one, as should leave commerce
on the freest footing possible. This was the plan on which we prepared
our general draught for treating with all nations. Of those with whom we
were to treat, I ever considered England, France, Spain, and Portugal
as capitally important; the first two, on account of their American
possessions, the last, for their European as well as American. Spain
is treating in America, and probably will give an advantageous treaty.
Portugal shows dispositions to do the same. France does not treat. It is
likely enough she will choose to keep the staff in her own hands. But,
in the mean time, she gives us an access to her West Indies, which,
though not all we wish, is yet extremely valuable to us: this access,
indeed, is much affected by the late "Arrêts" of the 18th and 25th of
September, which I enclose to you. I consider these as a reprisal for
the navigation acts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The minister
has complained to me, officially, of these acts, as a departure from the
reciprocity stipulated for by the treaty. I have assured him that his
complaints shall be communicated to Congress, and in the mean time,
observed that the example of discriminating between foreigners and
natives had been set by the "Arrêt" of August, <a href="/results.php?year=1784">1784</a>, and still more
remarkably by those of September the 18th and 25th, which, in effect,
are a prohibition of our fish in their islands. However, it is better
for us, that both sides should revise what they have done. I am in hopes
this country did not mean these as permanent regulations. <a href='/results.php?tla=wib' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Bingham</a>,
lately from Holland, tells me that the Dutch are much dissatisfied with
these acts. In fact, I expect the European nations, in general, will
rise up against an attempt of this kind, and wage a general commercial
war against us. They can do well without all our commodities except
tobacco, and we cannot find, elsewhere, markets for them. The
selfishness of England alone will not justify our hazarding a contest of
this kind against all Europe. Spain, Portugal, and France, have not yet
shut their doors against us: it will be time enough, when they do, to
take up the commercial hatchet. I hope, therefore, those States will
repeal their navigation clauses, except as against Great Britain and
other nations not treating with us.
</p><p>
I have made the inquiries you desire, as to American ship-timber for
this country. You know they sent some person (whose name was not told
us) to America, to examine the quality of our masts, spars, &c. I think
this was young Chaumont's business. They have, besides this, instructed
the officer who superintends their supplies of masts, spars, foe., to
procure good quantities from our northern States; but I think they have
made no contract: on the contrary, that they await the trials projected,
but with a determination to look to us for considerable supplies, if
they find our timber answer. They have on the carpet a contract for
live-oak from the southern States.
</p><p>
You ask why the Virginia merchants do not learn to sort their own
tobaccos? They can sort them as well as any other merchants whatever.
Nothing is better known than the quality of every hogshead of tobacco,
from the place of its growth. They know, too, the particular qualities
required in every market. They do not send their tobaccos, therefore, to
London to be sorted, but to pay their debts: and though they could send
them to other markets and remit the money to London, yet they find it
necessary to give their English merchant the benefit of the consignment
of the tobacco (which is enormously gainful), in order to induce him to
continue his indulgence for the balance due.
</p><p>
Is it impossible to persuade our countrymen to make peace with the Nova
Scotians? I am persuaded nothing is wanting but advances on our part;
and that it is in our power to draw off the greatest proportion of that
settlement, and thus to free ourselves from rivals who may become of
consequence. We are, at present, co-operating with Great Britain, whose
policy it is to give aliment to that bitter enmity between her States
and ours, which may secure her against their ever joining us. But would
not the existence of a cordial friendship between us and them, be the
best bridle we could possibly put into the mouth of England?
</p><p>
With respect to the Danish business, you will observe that the
instructions of Congress, article 3, of October the 29th, <a href="/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>, put it
entirely into the hands of the "Ministers Plenipotentiary of the United
States of America at the court of Versailles, empower to to negotiate
a peace, or to any one or more of them". At that time, I did not come
under this description. I had received the permission of Congress to
decline coming, in the spring preceding that date. On the first day
of November, <a href="/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>, that is to say, two days after the date of the
instructions to the commissioners, Congress recommended John Paul Jones
to the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States, at Versailles, as
agent, to solicit, under his direction, the payment of all prizes taken
in Europe under his command. But the object under their view, at that
time, was assuredly the money due from the court of Versailles, for the
prizes taken in the expedition by the Bon-homme Richard, the Alliance,
&c. In this business, I have aided him effectually, having obtained
a definitive order for paying the money to him, and a considerable
proportion being actually paid him. But they could not mean by their
resolution of November the 1st, to take from the commissioners, powers
which they had given them two days before. If there could remain a doubt
that this whole power has resulted to you, it would be cleared up by the
instructions of May the 7th, <a href="/results.php?year=1784">1784</a>, article 9, which declare, 'that these
instructions be considered as supplementary to those of October the
29th, <a href="/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>, and not as revoking, except where they contradict them;'
which shows that they considered the instructions of October the 29th,
<a href="/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>, as still in full force. I do not give you the trouble of this
discussion, to save myself the trouble of the negotiation. I should
have no objections to this part: but it is to avoid the impropriety of
meddling in a matter wherein I am unauthorized to act, and where any
thing I should pretend to conclude with the court of Denmark, might
have the appearance of a deception on them. Should it be in my power to
render any service in it, I shall do it with cheerfulness; but I repeat,
that I think you are the only person authorized.
</p><p>
I received, a few days ago, the "Nuova Minuta" of Tuscany, which <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='acquaintance met colleague'>Colonel Humphreys</a> will deliver you. I have been so engaged that I have not been
able to go over it with any attention. I observe, in general, that the
order of the articles is entirely deranged, and their diction almost
totally changed. When you shall have examined it, if you will be so good
as to send me your observations by post, in cipher, I will communicate
with you in the same way, and try to mature this matter.
</p><p>
The deaths of the Dukes of Orleans and Praslin, will probably reach you
through the channel of the public papers, before this letter does. Your
friends the Abbes are well, and always speak of you with affection.
<a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='acquaintance met colleague'>Colonel Humphreys</a> comes to pass some time in London. My curiosity
would render a short trip thither agreeable to me also, but I see no
probability of taking it. I will trouble you with my respects to Dr. Price. Those to <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='acquaintance'>Mrs. Adams</a>, I witness in a letter to herself.
</p><p>
I am, with very great esteem, Dear Sir,
</p><p>
your most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
