TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=Richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, April 7, <a href="/results.php?year=1781">1781</a>.
</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
Hearing that our arms from Rhode Island have arrived at <a href="/results.php?city=Philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,
I have begged the favor of our Delegates to send them on in wagons
immediately, and, for the conveyance of my letter, have taken the
liberty of setting the Continental line of expresses in motion, which I
hope our distress for arms will justify, though the errand be not purely
Continental.
</p><p>
I have nothing from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker'>General Greene</a> later than the 27th of March; our
accounts from Portsmouth vary the reinforcements which came under
General Phillips, from twenty-five hundred to three thousand. Arnold's
strength before, was, I think, reduced to eleven hundred. They have made
no movement yet. Their preparation of boats is considerable; whether
they mean to go southwardly or up the river, no leading circumstance has
yet decided.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect,
</p><p>
your Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>,
</p>
