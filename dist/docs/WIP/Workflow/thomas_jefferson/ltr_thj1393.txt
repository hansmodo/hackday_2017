TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.
</p><p>
In Council, April 18, <a href="/results.php?year=1781">1781</a>.
</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
I was honored, yesterday, with your Excellency's favor enclosing the
resolutions of Congress of the 8th instant, for removing stores and
provisions from the counties of Accomack and Northampton. We have there
no military stores, except a few muskets in the hands of the militia.
There are some collections of forage and provisions belonging to the
Continent, and some to the State, and the country there, generally,
furnishes an abundance of forage. But such is the present condition of
Chesapeake bay, that we cannot even get an advice-boat across it, with
any certainty, much less adventure on transportation. Should, however,
any interval happen, in which these articles may be withdrawn, we shall
certainly avail ourselves of it, and bring thence whatever we can.
</p><p>
If I have been rightly informed, the horses there are by no means such,
as that the enemy could apply them to the purposes of cavalry. Some,
large enough for the draught, may, perhaps, be found, but of these not
many.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,
</p><p>
your Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
