TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=Richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, March 28, <a href="/results.php?year=1781">1781</a>.
</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
I forward to your Excellency, under cover with this, copies of letters
received from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker'>Major General Greene</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a>, which will give
you the latest account of the situation of things with us and in North
Carolina.
</p><p>
I observe a late resolve of Congress, for furnishing a number of arms to
the southern states; and I lately wrote you on the subject of ammunition
and cartridge-paper. How much of this State, the enemy thus reinforced,
may think proper to possess themselves of, must depend on their own
moderation and caution, till these supplies arrive. We had hoped to
receive, by the French squadron under Monsieur Destouches, eleven
hundred stand of arms, which we had at Rhode Island, but were
disappointed. The necessity of hurrying forward the troops intended for
the southern operations will be doubtless apparent from this letter.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,
</p><p>
your Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
