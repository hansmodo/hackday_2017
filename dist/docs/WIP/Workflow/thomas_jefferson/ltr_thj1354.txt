</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
I take the liberty of putting under cover to your Excellency some
letters to Generals Phillips and <a href='/results.php?tla=far' rel='adversary'>Reidesel</a>, uninformed whether they are
gone into <a href="/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a> or not, and knowing that you can best forward them in
either case.
</p><p>
I also trouble you with a letter from the master of the flag in this
State, to the British commissary of prisoners in <a href="/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a>, trusting it
will thus be more certainly conveyed than if sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>. It is
my wish the British commissary should return his answer through your
Excellency, or your commissary of prisoners, and that they should not
propose, under this pretext, to send another flag, as the mission of the
present flag is not unattended with circumstances of suspicion; and a
certain information of the situation of ourselves and our allies here,
might influence the measures of the enemy.
</p><p>
Perhaps your commissary of prisoners can effect the former method of
answer.
</p><p>
I enclose to you part of an Act of Assembly ascertaining the quantity of
land, which shall be allowed to the officers and soldiers at the close
of the war, and providing means of keeping that country vacant which has
been allotted for them.
</p><p>
I am advised to ask your Excellency's attention to the case of Colonel
Bland, late commander of the barracks in Albemarle. When that gentleman
was appointed to that command, he attended the Executive here and
informed them he must either decline it, or be supported in such a
way as would keep up that respect which was essential to his command;
without, at the same time, ruining his private fortune.
</p><p>
The Executive were sensible he would be exposed to great and unavoidable
expense: they observed, his command would be in a department separate
from any other, and that he actually relieved a Major General from
the same service. They did not think themselves authorized to say what
should be done in this case, but undertook to represent the matter to
Congress, and, in the mean time, gave it as their opinion that he ought
to be allowed a decent table. On this, he undertook the office, and
in the course of it incurred expenses which seemed to have been
unavoidable, unless he would have lived in such a way as is hardly
reconcileable to the spirit of an officer, or the reputation of those
in whose service he is. Governor Henry wrote on the subject to Congress;
Colonel Bland did the same; but we learn they have concluded the
allowance to be unprecedented, and inadmissible in the case of an
officer of his rank. The commissaries, on this, have called on Colonel
Bland for reimbursement. A sale of his estate was about to take place,
when we undertook to recommend to them to suspend their demand, till we
could ask the favor of you to advocate this matter so far with Congress,
as you may think it right; otherwise the ruin of a very worthy officer
must inevitably follow. I have the honor to be, with the greatest
respect and esteem,
</p><p>
your Excellency's
</p><p>
most obedient servant,
</p><p>
