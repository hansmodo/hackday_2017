Dear Sir,
</p><p>
My last to you by Monsieur de Doradour, was dated May the 11th. Since
that, I have received yours of January the 22nd with six copies of the
revisal, and that of April the 27th by Mr. Mazzei.

All is quiet here. The Emperor and Dutch have certainly agreed, though
they have not published their agreement. Most of his schemes in Germany
must be postponed, if they are not prevented by the confederacy of many
of the Germanic body, at the head of which is the King of Prussia, and
to which the Elector of Hanover is supposed to have acceded. The object
of the league is to preserve the members of the empire in their present
state. I doubt whether the jealousy entertained of this prince, and
which is so fully evidenced by this league, may not defeat the election
of his nephew to be King of the Romans, and thus produce an instance of
breaking the lineal succession. Nothing is as yet done between him and
the Turks. If any thing is produced in that quarter, it will not be for
this year. The court of Madrid has obtained the delivery of the crew
of the brig Betsey, taken by the Emperor of Morocco. The Emperor had
treated them kindly, new-clothed them, and delivered them to the Spanish
minister, who sent them to Cadiz. This is the only American vessel ever
taken by the Barbary States. The Emperor continues to give proofs of his
desire to be in friendship with us, or, in other words, of receiving us
into the number of his tributaries. Nothing further need be feared from
him. I wish the Algerines may be as easily dealt with. I fancy the peace
expected between them and Spain is not likely to take place. I am well
informed that the late proceedings in America have produced a wonderful
sensation in England in our favor. I mean the disposition, which seems
to be becoming general, to invest Congress with the regulation of
our commerce, and, in the mean time, the measures taken to defeat the
avidity of the British government, grasping at our carrying business.
I can add with truth, that it was not till these symptoms appeared in
America, that I have been able to discover the smallest token of
respect towards the United States, in any part of Europe. There was an
enthusiasm towards us, all over Europe, at the moment of the peace. The
torrent of lies published unremittingly, in every day's London paper,
first made an impression, and produce a coolness. The republication of
these lies in most of the papers of Europe (done probably by authority
of the governments to discourage emigrations) carried them home to the
belief of every mind. They supposed every thing in America was anarchy,
tumult, and civil war. The reception of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel=''>Marquis Fayette</a> gave a check
to these ideas. The late proceedings seem to be producing a decisive
vibration in our favor. I think it possible that England may ply before
them. It is a nation which nothing but views of interest can govern. If
they produce us good there, they will here also. The defeat of the Irish
propositions is also in our favor.

I have at length made up the purchase of books for you, as far as it can
be done at present. The objects which I have not yet been able to get, I
shall continue to seek for. Those purchased, are packed this morning in
two trunks, and you have the catalogue and prices herein inclosed. The
future charges of transportation shall be carried into the next bill.
The amount of the present is 1154 livres, 13 sous, which, reckoning the
French crown of six livres at six shillings and eight pence, Virginia
money, is £64. 3s., which sum you will be so good as to keep in your
hands, to be used occasionally in the education of my nephews, when the
regular resources disappoint you. To the same use I would pray you to
apply twenty-five guineas, which I have lent the two Mr. Fitzhughs of
Marmion, and which I have desired them to repay into your hands. You
will of course deduct the price of the revisals, and of any other
articles you may have been so kind as to pay for me. Greek and Roman
authors are dearer here, than, I believe, any where in the world. Nobody
here reads them; wherefore they are not reprinted. Don Ulloa, in the
original, is not to be found. The collection of tracts on the economies
of different nations, we cannot find; nor Amelot's Travels into China.
I shall send these two trunks of books to Havre, there to wait a
conveyance to America; for as to the fixing the packets there, it is as
uncertain as ever. The other articles you mention, shall be procured
as far as they can be. Knowing that some of them would be better got in
London, I commissioned <a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Short</a>, who was going there, to get them. He
has not yet returned. They will be of such a nature as that I can
get some gentleman who may be going to America, to take them in his
portmanteau. Le Maire being now able to stand on his own legs, there
will be no necessity for your advancing him the money I desired, if it
is not already done. I am anxious to hear from you on the subject of
my Notes on Virginia. I have been obliged to give so many of them here,
that I fear their getting published. I have received an application from
the Directors of the public buildings, to procure them a plan for their
capitol. I shall send them one taken from the best morsel of ancient
architecture now remaining. It has obtained the approbation of fifteen
or sixteen centuries, and is, therefore, preferable to any design which
might be newly contrived. It will give more room, be more convenient,
and cost less, than the plan they sent me. Pray encourage them to wait
for it, and to execute it. It will be superior in beauty to any thing in
America, and not inferior to any thing in the world. It is very simple.
Have you a copying press? If you have not, you should get one. Mine
(exclusive of paper, which costs a guinea a ream) has cost me about
fourteen guineas. I would give ten times that sum, to have had it from
the date of the stamp act. I hope you will be so good as to continue
your communications, both of the great and small kind, which are equally
useful to me. Be assured of the sincerity with which I am, Dear Sir,
</p><p>
your friend and servant,
</p><p>
