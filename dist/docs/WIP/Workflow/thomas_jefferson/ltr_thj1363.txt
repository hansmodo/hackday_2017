Sir,
</p><p>
I have empowered Colonel Carrington to have twelve boats, scows, or
batteaux, built at Taylor's Ferry, and to draw on me for the cost. I
recommended the constructing them so as to answer the transportation of
provisions along that river, as a change of position of the two armies
may render them unnecessary at Taylor's Ferry, and I am thoroughly
persuaded, that, unless we can find out some channel of transportation
by water, no supplies of bread, of any consequence can be sent you
from this State for a long time to come. The want of wagons is a bar
insuperable, at least in any reasonable time. I have given orders to
have Fry and Jefferson's map, and Henry's map of Virginia, sought for
and purchased. As soon as they can be got, I will forward them. I have
also written to <a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met">General Washington</a> on the subject of wintering the
French fleet in the Chesapeake. Our new levies rendezvous in large
numbers. As <a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met">General Washington</a> had constituted them in eight battalions,
and allotted none to Colonel Harrison, we think to deliver him about
four hundred drafts of another kind, who are to serve eighteen months
also. Unless Congress furnish small arms, we cannot arm more than half
the men who will go from this State. The prize you mention of tents and
blankets is very fortunate. It is absolutely out of our power to get
these articles, to any amount, in this country, nor have we clothing for
our new levies. They must, therefore, go to you clothed as militia,
till we can procure and send on supplies. They will be as warm in their
present clothing at Hillsborough, as at Chesterfield Court House.
</p><p>
We have an agent collecting all the beeves which can be got from the
counties round about Portsmouth, to send off to you.
</p><p>
They have there also plentiful crops of corn growing. We have instructed
him to try whether means of conveying it down into the Sounds, and up
some of the rivers of North Carolina, or by land to Meherrin river, and
thence down Chowan, and up Roanoke, cannot be rendered practicable.
</p><p>
I am, with every sentiment of esteem and respect,
</p><p>
your most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
</p><p>

P.S. I enclose a certificate, acknowledging satisfaction for the money
furnished Colonel Kosciusko. T. J.
