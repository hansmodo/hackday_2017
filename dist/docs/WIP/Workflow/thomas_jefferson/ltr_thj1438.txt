TO COLONEL MONROE.
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=Paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, August 28, 1735.
</p><p>
Dear Sir,
</p><p>
I wrote you on the 5th of July by <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Franklin</a>, and on the 12th of the
same month by Monsieur Houdon. Since that date, yours of June the 16th,
by Mr. Mazzei, has been received. Every thing looks like peace here. The
settlement between the Emperor and Dutch is not yet published, but it is
believed to be agreed on. Nothing is done, as yet, between him and
the Porte. He is much wounded by the confederation of several of the
Germanic body, at the head of which is the King of Prussia, and to which
the King of England, as Elector of Hanover, is believed to accede. The
object is to preserve the constitution of that empire. It shows that
these princes entertain serious jealousies of the ambition of the
Emperor, and this will very much endanger the election of his nephew as
King of the Romans. A late _Arrêt_ of this court against the admission
of British manufactures produces a great sensation in England. I wish
it may produce a disposition there to receive our commerce in all their
dominions, on advantageous terms. This is the only balm which can heal
the wounds that it has received. It is but too true, that that country
furnished markets for three fourths of the exports of the eight
northernmost states. A truth not proper to be spoken of, but which
should influence our proceedings with them.
</p><p>
The July French packet having arrived without bringing any news of Mr. Lambe, if the English one of the same month be also arrived, without
news of him, I expect <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> will concur with me in sending some
other person to treat with the Barbary States. Mr. Barclay is willing to
go, and I have proposed him to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>, but have not yet received his
answer. The peace expected between Spain and Algiers will probably
not take place. It is said the former was to have given a million of
dollars. Would it not be prudent to send a minister to Portugal? Our
commerce with that country is very important; perhaps more so than with
any other country in Europe. It is possible too, that they might permit
our whaling vessels to refresh in Brazil, or give some other indulgences
in America. The lethargic character of their ambassador here, gives a
very unhopeful aspect to a treaty on this ground. I lately spoke with
him on the subject, and he has promised to interest himself in obtaining
an answer from his court.
</p><p>
I have waited to see what was the pleasure of Congress, as to the
secretaryship of my office here; that is, to see whether they proposed
to appoint a secretary of legation, or leave me to appoint a private
secretary. <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='acquaintance met colleague'>Colonel Humphreys</a>' occupation in the despatches and records
of the matters which relate to the general commissions, does not afford
him leisure to aid me in my office, were I entitled to ask that aid. In
the mean time, the long papers which often accompany the communications
between the ministers here and myself, and the other business of the
office, absolutely require a scribe. I shall, therefore, on <a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Short's</a>
return from the Hague, appoint him my private secretary, 'til congress
shall think proper to signify their pleasure. The salary allowed Mr.
Franklin, in the same office, was one thousand dollars a year. I shall
presume that <a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='co-worker met'>Mr Short</a> may draw the same allowance from the funds of the
United States here. As soon as I shall have made this appointment, I
shall give official notice of it to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a>, that Congress may, if they
disapprove it, say so.
</p><p>
I am much pleased with your land ordinance, and think it improved from
the first, in the most material circumstances. I had mistaken the object
of the division of the lands among the States. I am sanguine in my
expectations of lessening our debts by this fund, and have expressed
my expectations to the minister and others here. I see by the public
papers, you have adopted the dollar as your money unit. In the
arrangement of coins, I proposed, I ought to have inserted a gold coin
of five dollars, which, being within two shillings of the value of a
guinea, would be very convenient.
</p><p>
The English papers are so incessantly repeating their lies, about the
tumults, the anarchy, the bankruptcies, and distresses of America, that
these ideas prevail very generally in Europe. At a large table where
I dined the other day, a gentleman from Switzerland expressed his
apprehensions for the fate of <a href="/results.php?tla=ben" rel="co-worker met">Benjamin Franklin</a>, as he said he had been
informed, that he would be received with stones by the people, who were
generally dissatisfied with the Revolution, and incensed against
all those who had assisted in bringing it about. I told him his
apprehensions were just, and that the people of America would probably
salute <a href="/results.php?tla=ben" rel="co-worker met">Benjamin Franklin</a> with the same stones they had thrown at the <a href="/results.php?tla=laf" rel="">Marquis Fayette</a>. The reception of the Doctor is an object of very general
attention, and will weigh in Europe, as an evidence of the satisfaction
or dissatisfaction of America with their Revolution. As you are to be
in <a href="/results.php?city=Williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> early in November, this is the last letter I shall write
you till about that time.
</p><p>
I am, with very sincere esteem, dear Sir,
</p><p>
your friend and servant,
</p><p>
