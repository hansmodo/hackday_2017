Sir,
</p><p>
My last letter to you was dated the 17th of June. The present serves to
cover some papers put into my hands by Captain Paul Jones. They respect
an ancient matter, which is shortly this.
</p><p>
While Captain Jones was hovering on the coast of England, in the
year <a href="/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>, a British pilot, John Jackson by name, came on board him,
supposing him to be British. Captain Jones found it convenient to detain
him as a pilot, and, in the action with the Serapis, which ensued, this
man lost his arm. It is thought that this gives him a just claim to the
same allowance with others, who have met with the like misfortune in
the service of the United States. Congress alone being competent to this
application, it is my duty to present the case to their consideration;
which I beg leave to do through you.
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=ben" rel="co-worker met">Benjamin Franklin</a> will be able to give you so perfect a state of all
transactions relative to his particular office in France, as well as to
the subjects included in our general commission, that it is unnecessary
for me to enter on them. His departure, with the separate situation of
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> and myself, will render it difficult to communicate to you
the future proceedings of the commission, as regularly as they have
been heretofore. We shall do it, however, with all the punctuality
practicable, either separately or jointly, as circumstances may require
and admit.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect, Sir,
</p><p>
your most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
