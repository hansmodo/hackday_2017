Sir,
</p><p>
It is possible you may have heard, that in the course of last summer an
expedition was meditated, by our Colonel Clarke, against Detroit: that
he had proceeded so far as to rendezvous a considerable body of
Indians, I believe four or five thousand, at St. Vincennes; but, being
disappointed in the number of whites he expected, and not choosing to
rely principally on the Indians, he was obliged to decline it. We have
a tolerable prospect of reinforcing him this spring, to the number which
he thinks sufficient for the enterprise. We have informed him of this,
and left him to decide between this object, and that of giving vigorous
chastisement to those tribes of Indians, whose eternal hostilities have
proved them incapable of living on friendly terms with us. It is our
opinion, his inclination will lead him to determine on the former. The
reason of my laying before your Excellency this matter, is, that it
has been intimated to me that <a href='/results.php?tla=dab' rel=''>Colonel Broadhead</a> is meditating a similar
expedition. I wished, therefore, to make you acquainted with what we had
in contemplation. The enterprising and energetic genius of Clarke is not
altogether unknown to you. You also know (what I am a stranger to) the
abilities of <a href='/results.php?tla=dab' rel=''>Broadhead</a>, and the particular force with which you will be
able to arm him for such an expedition. We wish the most hopeful
means should be used for removing so uneasy a thorn from our side. As
yourself, alone, are acquainted with all the circumstances necessary for
well informed decision, I am to ask the favor of your Excellency, if you
should think <a href='/results.php?tla=dab' rel=''>Broadhead's</a> undertaking it most likely to produce success,
that you will be so kind as to intimate to us to divert Clarke to the
other object, which is also important to this State. It will, of course,
have weight with you in forming your determination, that our prospect of
strengthening Clarke's hands, sufficiently, is not absolutely certain.
It may be necessary, perhaps, to inform you, that these two officers
cannot act together, which excludes the hopes of ensuring success by a
joint expedition.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the most sincere esteem,
</p><p>
your Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
