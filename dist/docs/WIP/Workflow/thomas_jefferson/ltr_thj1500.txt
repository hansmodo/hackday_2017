London, March 12, <a href="/results.php?year=1786">1786</a>.
</p><p>
Sir.
</p><p>
The date of a letter from London will doubtless be as unexpected to you
as it was unforeseen by myself, a few days ago. On the 27th of the last
month, Colonel Smith arrived in <a href="/results.php?city=Paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, with a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>,
informing me that there was at this place a minister from Tripoli,
having general powers to enter into treaties on behalf of his State, and
with whom it was possible we might do something, under our commission
to that power: and that he gave reason to believe, he could also make
arrangements with us, for Tunis. He further added, that the minister
of Portugal here had received ultimate instructions from his court, and
that, probably, that treaty might be concluded in the space of three
weeks, were we all on the spot together. He, therefore, pressed me to
come over immediately. The first of these objects had some weight on my
mind, because, as we had sent no person to Tripoli or Tunis, I thought
if we could meet a minister from them on this ground, our arrangements
would be settled much sooner, and at less expense. But what principally
decided me, was, the desire of bringing matters to a conclusion with
Portugal, before the term of our commissions should expire, or any
new turn in the negotiations of France and England should abate their
willingness to fix a connection with us. A third motive had also its
weight. I hoped that my attendance here, and the necessity of shortening
it, might be made use of to force a decisive answer from this court.
I therefore concluded to comply with <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>'s request. I went
immediately to Versailles, and apprized the Count de Vergennes, that
circumstances of public duty called me hither for three or four weeks,
arranged with him some matters, and set out with Colonel Smith for this
place, where we arrived last night, which was as early as the excessive
rigor of the weather admitted. I saw <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> immediately, and again
to-day. He informs me, that the minister of Portugal was taken ill five
or six days ago, has been very much so, but is now somewhat better.
It would be very mortifying, indeed, should this accident, with the
shortness of the term to which I limit my stay here, defeat what was the
principal object of my journey, and that, without which, I should hardly
have undertaken it. With respect to this country, I had no doubt but
that every consideration had been urged by <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>, which was proper
to be urged. Nothing remains undone in this way. But we shall avail
ourselves of my journey here, as if made on purpose, just before the
expiration of our commission, to form our report to Congress on the
execution of that commission, which report, they may be given to
know, cannot be formed without decisive information of the ultimate
determination of their court. There is no doubt what that determination
will be: but it will be useful to have it; as it may put an end to all
further expectations on our side the water, and show that the time
is come for doing whatever is to be done by us, for counteracting the
unjust and greedy designs of this country. We shall have the honor,
before I leave this place, to inform you of the result of the several
matters which have brought me to it.
</p><p>
A day or two before my departure from <a href="/results.php?city=Paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, I received your letter of
January------. The question therein proposed, How far France considers
herself as bound to insist on the delivery of the posts, would
infallibly produce another, How far we consider ourselves as guarantees
of their American possessions, and bound to enter into any future war,
in which these may be attacked? The words of the treaty of alliance
seem to be without ambiguity on either head, yet, I should be afraid to
commit Congress, by answering without authority. I will endeavor, on
my return, to sound the opinion of the minister, if possible, without
exposing myself to the other question. Should any thing forcible
be meditated on these posts, it would possibly be thought prudent,
previously to ask the good offices of France, to obtain their delivery.
In this case, they would probably say, we must first execute the treaty,
on our part, by repealing all acts which have contravened it. Now this
measure, if there be any candor in the court of London, would suffice to
obtain a delivery of the posts from them, without the mediation of any
third power. However, if this mediation should be finally needed, I
see no reason to doubt our obtaining it, and still less to question its
omnipotent influence on the British court.

I have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, Sir, your
most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
