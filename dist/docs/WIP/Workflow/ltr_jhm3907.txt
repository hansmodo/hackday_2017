First, You are to take with you four or five judicious, intelligent 
persons, to meet those appointed on the part of Ganey and others, to 
confer on the business herein committed to your charge, but they are 
not to be considered as joined with you in this commission. Second, 
The said Ganey and others, with whom such truce was made, are to lay 
down their arms as enemies to this State, and are not to resume them 
again until called on to do so, in support of the interest of the United 
States, and of this State in particular. Third, They are to deliver up 
all negroes, horses, cattle, and other property, that have been plundered 
from the inhabitants of this or any other State. Fourth, They are to 
engage to demean themselves as peaceable citizens of this State, and 
submit themselves in future to be governed by its laws, in the same 
manner as the rest of the citizens thereof. Fifth, They are to be 
allowed two, or, if you find it necessary, three months, to remain at 
home, before they are called on to bear arms in behalf of this State. 
Sixth, They are to engage to apprehend and deliver up all persona 
within their district, who shall refuse to accede to these terms, and contumaciously persist in rebellion against the State. Seventh, If these 
terms are accepted by the said Graney and others, you are then to 
promise them a full pardon for all treasons heretofore committed by 
them against the State. Eighth, If these terms are rejected by the 
said Graney and others before mentioned, you are then to have recourse 
to force of arms, or otherwise to compel them to submission. Ninth, 
You are authorized and empowered, if you shall deem it for the public 
service, to apprehend, and send within the enemy's lines, any of the 
families of persons who continue in arms against the State.

Given under my hand, at Cane Acre, this 21st day of May, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two.
