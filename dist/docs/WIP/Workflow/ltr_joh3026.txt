SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 23d, containing the agreeable 
intelligence that the enemy had retreated from 
Brunswick, I had the honor of receiving yesterday 
afternoon, and shall this morning, with the greatest pleasure, lay it before Congress. Give me leave to 
congratulate you very sincerely upon this event; as 
it must be principally ascribed to the prudence and 
wisdom of your operations, which had so embarrassed 
the enemy as to reduce them to the necessity of 
acting in the manner they have done. Should they 
be compelled finally to abandon the Jerseys, which I 
Hatter myself will be the case, it will be the most 
explicit declaration to the whole world, that the conquest of America is not only a very distant, but an 
unattainable object. We have seen them, after pene 
trating some miles into our country, precipitately 
driven back, and in a moment obliged to evacuate 
towns, after keeping possession of them only a few 
months. 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose you the resolves 
of Congress respecting the Commissary's Department, 
together with a list of the persons appointed to carry 
it into execution. I beg leave to request your attention to them, and to the other resolves herewith transmitted. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 20th instant was duly received, 
and immediately communicated to Congress. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest esteem, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
