REV D AND DEAR SIR, Last night I received a letter 
from D r Robertson, acquainting me that the University of 
Edinburgh have on my recommendation conferred the degree 
of D r in Divinity upon the Rev d M r Cooper of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; an 
event, that when I last had the pleasure of seeing you, you 
may remember I was desirous of waiting for, before I should 
be concerned in any new application of the same kind. And 
indeed as I have made three already, I begin to feel a little 
unwilling to apply again immediately to the same University in 
favour of another, lest they should think me troublesome, tho' 
they have hitherto been very obliging. And recollecting that 
you mentioned your having a correspondence with the Principal of the College at Glasgow, I now purpose applying to 
that University for Mr Elliot's l degree, if you approve of it, 
and will with Mr Radcliffe address your recommendation 
to the same place, to accompany mine. Please to present 
my respectful compliments to Mrs Price and Mrs Barker; 
and believe me, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
