Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my last to your Excellency, I have received 
a letter from General Parsons, dated the 10th instant, filled with severe remarks and reflections on 
our Legislature. A copy thereof, with my answer, 
is inclosed. 
</p><p>
I wish to do the things that make for peace with 
both officers and men of the Connecticut line of the 
army, consisting of our own people, raised for defending and securing the rights and liberties of the whole, 
embarked in the same common cause, and to return 
to citizens again when the contest with the British 
King and Ministry is ended; to prevent, if possible, 
discord and division, so very dangerous in our situation, and hazardous to our present operations. Surely 
the officers do not desire to inflame the soldiery with 
apprehensions that the Assembly deny them that 
justice which was done them the last year, with 
which they were satisfied, when the Committee from 
the line know the whole accounts of pay and wages 
were gone through, and ready to be closed on the 
same principles, and that nothing remained in question but only the detained rations of the officers. 
This was not agitated, till it became time for the 
Committee to return to their duty ; when there was scarcely time for the members of so numerous a "body 
to deliberate on the subject. Eight-pence half-penny 
per ration was offered from the 1st of April, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. Many were of opinion, that by the time of payment, 
that rate would be more than sufficient for the same. 
Others proposed to secure a specific payment. As to 
what was due before that 1st of April, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, it naturally lay open for the direction of the Honorable Congress. 
</p><p>
In the midst of these deliberations, the Committee 
left us unexpectedly. I observed no design to deny 
justice to the officers ; to the soldiery there could be 
none. The accounts were fully agreed, prepared, and 
ready to be closed. I choose to forbear any recrimination. Yet suffer me to inquire, why the Committee 
from the line did not bring on the settlement for 
detained rations earlier. They knew it must require 
time of deliberation, when they well knew the principles for settlement of pay and wages were agreed 
on the last year. Do they mean to press for more 
than justice, from the necessity of their present services, and the fears of fatal consequences if denied? 
The whole line know and ought to consider their pay 
and wages are secured in full value, while the depreciation operates as a heavy tax upon the rest of 
the people. The officers may likewise consider, that 
their pay vas raised by Congress, fifty per cent, 
above what the State agreed with them for. The maxim adopted by the enemy is that old one of divide et imjiera. Shall we suffer avarice to divide 
and ruin us and our cause, and give them opportunity to exult and triumph over us ? 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> hath and doth smile propitiously upon 
us, and calls aloud for union, vigorous exertions, patience, and perseverance, and to endure hardship as 
good soldiers, that the end may be peace. Justice 
and peace ride together in the same chariot. It will 
he my constant endeavour, that peace may be obtained on just and honorable terms, and that justice be 
done to them who jeopard their lives in the high 
places of the field, in defence of, and to secure the 
blessings of freedom for ourselves and posterity. 
</p><p>
I wrote yesterday to the Treasurer, to inform me 
this week, what sum of hard money is and can be 
immediately collected for the arm}'-, which shall be 
sent forward without delay. The measures directed, 
and orders given for raising and marching our troops 
to the army, are now diligently carrying into execution. I have the honor to be, with every sentiment 
of esteem and consideration. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
