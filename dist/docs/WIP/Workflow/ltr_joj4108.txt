Dear .Sir. 
</p><p>
My first idea was to have made a sketch of what, in my opinion, would be proper on the occasion ; but finding in the progress of it that my information relative to the actual 
state of affairs was not sufficiently particular, and in several respects defective, it became necessary to confine my several remarks. 
</p><p>
How far the present fiscal arrangements require amendments or additions, can best be ascertained of the secretary. I recollect one case which should be provided for, 
viz. where bribes are offered to revenue officers. It will 
rarely happen that the offer of a bribe can be proved, except by the man to whom it is offered, and if he be disqualified (by being interested in the penalty) from giving 
testimony, the offender must be acquitted. Auxiliary provisions may, in the execution of other parts of these 
statutes, have been found wanting ; this merits inquiry. If 
amendments are contemplated, it may be proper to observe, that as all new T institutions are liable to defects which 
experience only can discover, it may be useful to consider 
whether the revenue laws require any amendments to render them more competent to their objects. 
</p><p>
Whether it is intended to bring forward any and what 
plans for additional supplies, I know not; if it is, some general ideas leading the attention that way might be expedient. If not, perhaps it would be well to observe, that the 
existing revenues being equal to the ordinary exigences of 
the nation, it will not be necessary to increase them for 
any other purpose than that of reducing the public debt. 
This idea, I think, should be constantly held up. 
</p><p>
If there should this year be a surplus of revenue, the 
whole or part of which could be spared for domestic objects, might it not be best to apply it towards discharging 
the French debt, and to introduce the recommendation by 
some observations like these, viz. that the friendly disposition and aids of the king and people of France had been 
highly conducive to the establishment of our liberty and 
independence : and therefore that they might, with great 
propriety, expect from the United States every mark of 
attention which their and our circumstances might render 
eligible. That the cause of liberty and good government 
was the cause of all mankind ; and that the exertions of the 
citizens of France to introduce and establish those blessings, 
not only merited general approbation, but were particularly 
entitled to our best wishes for their success. That the 
United States could not better evince this friendly disposition than by applying part of their revenues towards paying the debt due to France, at a season when, from the 
derangements incident to revolutions, it could not fail of 
being both acceptable and useful. 
</p><p>
Indian affairs afford another topic, but on this subject my 
information is too limited to enable me to see things as 
they probably are. But be they as they may, it might 
answer a good purpose occasionally to hint at the justice 
and policy of treating those nations with benevolence, and 
with constant regard to good faith. 
</p><p>
If circumstances of importance should make it proper to 
say any thing of the territories, and the immediate government of the United States, it would afford an opportunity 
of recommending the encouragement of schools, and the 
policy of assisting the settlers in making such highways as 
might open and facilitate communications with the adjacent 
States. 
</p><p>
As to foreign affairs, I am inclined to think that at present 
little, if any thing, should be said about them; unless some 
matters very interesting to the United States should have 
occurred. It is said, that a minister from England may 
soon be expected. He may, or he may not come. The 
disposition of that court towards us cannot yet, I believe, 
be unequivocally ascertained. To be silent, and thereby 
to avoid either courting or irritating them, appears to me 
advisable in the present moment 
</p><p>
The judicial system undoubtedly calls for revision; but 
I rather think it will be better to include it generally among 
those other subjects heretofore recommended, which it may 
be necessary again to mention, than to make any pointed 
remarks respecting it. 
</p><p>
To convey necessary information, and to suggest useful 
hints on the one hand, and on the other so to do both as to 
cause as few questions or divisions as possible in framing 
the addresses in answer, seems to be all that can be requisite. 
</p><p>
All things have their order. All that ought to be done, 
cannot be done at once. Those, therefore, of the greatest 
present importance should take the lead, and the rest be 
reserved for future sessions. 
</p><p>
As to public and private communications, it strikes me 
that the former should contain only important and public 
information, and in generals ; and that details, as well as 
intelligence of a more secret nature, or of lesser importance, should be conveyed by message. 
</p><p>
The census is a subject about which much might, but 
little need be said, the observations pertinent to it being obvious. I think that something should be said, generally 
and cautiously (by way of information), of the proceedings 
in the business of the federal district ; and if necessary, 
the details mav be communicated by message. Of the 
bank, I doubt the expediency of saying any tiling ; especially as its affairs are under the management of its 
directors. 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear sir, I have committed to paper what 
passed in my mind relative to these subjects with that freedom which your friendship invites, and without that caution 
and reserve which a sense of your judgment, experience, 
and discretion tends naturally to create. 
I regret the circumstance which called you to Mount 
Vernon, and hope the recovery of your nephew has relieved you from all anxieties on that account. I can perceive no reasons which ought to restrain you from frequent 
visits to it during the recess of Congress. It would conduce to your health, and so far to the public good. Besides, the distance is not so great, but that in the ordinary 
course of things, your presence at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> might, at 
convenient intervals, be spared ; for should any thing extraordinary occur, you might very soon be advised of it, 
and if necessary, return. Be pleased to present my respectful compliments to your lady ; and believe me to be, with 
perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
