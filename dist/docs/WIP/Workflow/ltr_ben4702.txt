DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I received your obliging favour of May 16th. I am always 
glad to hear from you, when you have leisure to write, and I 
expect no apologies for your not writing. I wish all correspondence was on the foot of writing and answering when 
one can, or when one is disposed to it, without the compulsions of ceremony. I am pleased with your scheme of a Medical Library at the Hospital; and I fancy I can procure you 
some donations among my medical friends here, if you will 
send me a catalogue of what books you already have. Enclosed I send you the only book of the kind in my possession 
here, having just received it as a present from the author. It 
is not yet published to be sold, and will not be for some time, 
till the second part is ready to accompany it. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your remarks on the gout. They may be 
useful to me, who have already had some touches of that distemper. As to Lord Chatham, it is said that his constitution 
is totally destroyed and gone, partly through the violence of 
the disease, and partly by his own continual quacking with 
it. There is at present no access to him. He is said to be 
not capable of receiving, any more than of giving, advice. 
</p><p>
But still there is such a deference paid to him, that much 
business is delayed on his account, that so when entered on 
it may have the strength of his concurrence, or not be liable 
to his reprehension, if he should recover his ability and 
activity. The ministry, we at present have, has not been 
looked upon, either by itself or others, as settled, which is 
another cause of postponing every thing not immediately 
necessary to be considered. New men, and perhaps new 
measures, are often expected and apprehended, whence 
arise continual cabals, factions, and intrigues among the outs 
and ins, that keep every thing in confusion. And when 
affairs will mend is very uncertain. With great esteem I am, 
dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
