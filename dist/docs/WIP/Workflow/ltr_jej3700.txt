Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
A report from the Board of War, in consequence 
of a letter of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s to Congress, referred 
to the Board, respecting the promotion of Colonel Daniel Morgan to the office of Brigadier-General, now 
lies upon the table, at my request. The Board have 
stated his former services, his being first Colonel of 
our line, and the deficiency of that State at present 
in her quota of troops. If a promotion of General Officers is to take place, and to be made through the 
line of the army, Morgan has many before him ; but 
if the promotions are to be through the line of the 
State, that officer, it appears, stands first. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> has mentioned his intention of giving Morgan 
the command of a body of light infantry; but, as the 
State has given the command of the militia, lately 
sent to the southward, to Colonel Stevens, who was 
Morgan's junior officer in the Continental line, with 
the commission of Brigadier-General, he will command 
Colonel Morgan, and this. Gates thinks, will disgust 
him, and therefore, with great earnestness and warmth, 
presses his promotion. I shall thank you for your confidential communications upon This matter, as the 
report, I think, will not be pressed or taken up until 
the Virginia Delegates are fully informed, as it was 
upon my motion, to obtain time for information, it lies 
upon the table. Besides, as he left the army in disgust, under your immediate command, I did not like 
the present mode of his obtaining the promotion, without (that I know of) any alteration of circumstances, 
at the pressing instance of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>.

Pray, my dear Sir, do you recollect the purport of 
a letter lately written to Colonel Harrison, Speaker 
of the House of Delegates, representing the deranged 
state of the French finances, their as well as Spain's 
declining navy, and the increasing strength of the 
British navy? I have heard of such a letter that 
gentleman received from you, and had shown to many 
of the members of our Assembly, and that it was 
like to prejudice rather than promote the service. I 
mention this in confidence, as the purport of the 
letter may have been misrepresented, and I have it 
not directly from one who saw it, or heard it read. 
Between ourselves, I fear that worthy man is no 
zealous friend of the alliance. I may be mistaken, 
but it is my present opinion.

An account, transmitted to the Admiralty Board 
by General Torman, makes the British, on the New 
York station, nine line-of-battle ships, two or three 
fifties, and seventeen frigates, and other armed vessels. 
Should this intelligence be true, the French fleet, as 
we have been told, though we have not yet the particulars of their strength, will be unequal to the 
undertaking. My letters from Virginia speak of our 
people as being roused. A bill had passed the Delegates, by a majority of three only, adopting the 
scheme of finance recommended by Congress. Thirteea of the Senate only were present ; the opmion 
of ten of these publicly known, five for, and five 
against the bill. It was conjectured the others were 
in favor of the measure. Every fifteenth militia-man 
is to be drafted to fill up the deficiency of our line. 
This bill was also before the Senate. I hope you find 
the recruits coming in fast. The news of the arrival 
of the fleet will accelerate them. With great respect, 
I am, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant,
