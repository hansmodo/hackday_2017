DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received yours of the 17th. The flag must be sent immediately 
back, with all her cargo, passengers, attendance, goods, &c., &c., except Mrs. Shad, Mrs. Barnes and Miss Simmons, and their attendances 
and property; and I positively order no other man, woman or servants, 
or any property, be landed, or suffered to come ashore but the vessel 
ordered immediately to go out of the harbor, on pain of being made a 
prize in twenty-four hours after such notice be given; and you are 
hereby ordered to make prize of said vessel, cargo, &c., &c., and the 
captain, crew and passengers to put in close confinement, without suffering any person whatever to visit or speak to either of said prisoners, 
until rny further orders. McClean, with his companions, must be kept in close confinement until a proper opportunity offers to send them to the Governor of North Carolina. Col.'s is trading on his private 
account, and I am not surprised at anything he has, or can do; he is no friend. I wrote you respecting the pilots, and I left you to act as 
you pleased respecting the boat mentioned in my last. Mr. Chatelleat has my pass to go to the Northward. You will permit the flag to carry 
one barrel of rice, and a few poultry, for the relief of Mr. John Clements, a prisoner, and wounded in Charlestown; he is one of my brigade. 
No officer ever had a right to public horses; but those you have you will keep, and you have a right to them, until my further orders. The 
officers and men of your corps here must remain as yet. The report of galley or armed vessels to go to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, I do not think true, as 
I had a letter from Charlestown last evening, that says a French fleet is at Tybee; and, from the person it came from, I have reason to believe it may be true. 
</p><p>
I am, with esteem, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P ? S. Since I wrote the above, I have perused the papers sent, and 
find Col. Ray is exchanged; he and the others mentioned in General 
Butler's pass are to be put on board the flag vessel, and suffered to proceed to Charlestown.
