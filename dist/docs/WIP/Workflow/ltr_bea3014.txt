DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My last was of the 14th instant, advising you of my crossing 
the St. Lawrence, and being before Quebec ; since which I have 
not had the pleasure of hearing from you. I then informed you 
of my situation and prospects. Fearing that may have miscarried, I have thought proper to despatch the bearer, a merchant 
of Quebec, and particular friend of mine, who has been kind 
enough to offer his service, and will inform you more fully than 
in my power to write. I am very anxious to hear from you, 
and much more to see you here. I am, dear Sir, with great 
esteem, Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
