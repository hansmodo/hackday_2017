Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On my arrival at this post, I found every thing 
thrown into great confusion, by the troops removing 
from hence, and the militia coming in. Colonel Malcom had ordered returns to be made of the militia, 
provisions, and stores of every kind, which I expect 
this morning, and will transmit a copy to your Excellency. I believe a sufficient number of militia 
have arrived to replace those of this State, who will 
leave this to-morrow or next day. I am sorry to 
observe, that there is not one tent for the militia 
(which are absolutely necessary at the redoubts), and 
the barracks will not contain more than seven hundred, unless they are crowded, so as to injure their 
health ; and many of them are daily falling sick. 
This will be delivered your Excellency by Doctor Ledyard, who waits on you to obtain a supply of 
medicines and stores for the sick, who are numerous, 
and without fresh provisions or any necessaries ; and 
I am assured by him and Doctor Burnet, that there 
are not hospital stores in the department sufficient 
to last the sick one fortnight, nor is there any prospect of obtaining a supply, unless by an application 
to Congress or <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>. 
</p><p>
The quantity of salted meat at this post, I am informed, is small. It appears to me that the whole 
ought to be reserved, and the troops fed on fresh 
provisions. I know not from what quarter we are to expect a supply. I have wrote Colonel Blain on 
the subject, but believe an order from your Excellency to him will be necessary. 
</p><p>
I shall pay the strictest attention to my orders, 
but cannot flatter myself with effecting as much with 
raw militia as would be done with an equal number 
of disciplined troops ; and I am very apprehensive 
that the troops, by being exposed, will become sickly, 
and desertions follow in consequence. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient, humble servant,
