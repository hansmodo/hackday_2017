Dear Benson, 
</p><p>
When shall we again, by a cheerful fire, or under a shadytree, recapitulate our juvenile pursuits or pleasures, or look 
back on the extensive field of politics we once have trodden ? 
Our plans of life have, within these few years past, been 
strangely changed. Our country, I hope, will be the better 
for the alterations. How far we, individually, may be benefited, is more questionable. Personal considerations, however, must give way to public ones, and the consciousness 
of having done our duty to our country and posterity, must 
recompense us for all the evils we experience in their cause. 
</p><p>
I wrote to you from Martinico. I have been four months 
in this kingdom without receiving more than three letters 
from America, and those not very interesting, being of old 
dates and not particular. You are among those from whom 
I wish often to hear, as well because I am interested in 
what concerns yourself, as on account of the intelligence 
respecting the affairs of our State, which I hope you will 
sometimes favour me with. Write nothing, nevertheless, 
that you would wish to be entirely private ; your letters 
may be inspected before they reach me ; that practice being 
general in the post-offices of France and Spain. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself you sometimes visit your <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a> friends. 
I know they esteem you, and always derive pleasure from your company. What arrangements have born made in your official departments ? Are your taxes paid ? Do the 
people continue firm ? A few more glorious exertions will give them peace, liberty, and safety. What says Vermont? 
</p><p>
Tell me how your mother and brothers do. Remember me to them, and my other friends. God bless you, my friend. 
</p><p>
I am sincerely yours, 
</p><p>
