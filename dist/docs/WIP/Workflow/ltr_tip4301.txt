Sir, 
</p><p>
I intended to have done myself the honor of waiting on you in person; but a letter may give you 
less trouble. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> informed me, that it would be agreeable to you that I should undertake the Superintendency of the northern Indians ; I mean particularly 
the Six Nations. I answered that, by the new Constitution of Pennsylvania, a Continental appointment 
was declared to be incompatible with the appointments I held under the State; and I supposed the 
nature of such superintendency would not warrant 
any considerable emolument. In a subsequent conversation, I intimated a willingness to perform the 
necessary services respecting the Six Nations, without 
any formal appointment; but this idea seemed not to 
have been approved. 
</p><p>
Afterwards I found that all the Indians, north of 
the Ohio, were already arranged under one department, of which <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> was the Superintendent, who, with your permission, might appoint a 
Deputy. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> seemed to wish that the 
matter might be suspended until the arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>, who was daily expected. Since that 
time I have reflected on the subject, and, upon the 
whole, would beg leave to decline taking the Superintendency proposed, though not without expressing 
the real pleasure I feel in the favorable sentiments 
you entertain concerning me, and assuring you of my 
readiness to perform any occasional services in that 
line, which your wishes for the public good may require. 
</p><p>
Permit me, Sir, to add a few words relative to the 
subject of the last letter I had the honor to write to 
you. Before I wrote, two circumstances made me 
hesitate. One, lest it should be thought that I, like 
many projectors, was contriving an employment for 
myself; the other, lest, if such a plan should be approved and established, I should in fact be requested 
to undertake the execution of it, to which request 
sentiments of humanity and regard to the public 
good might urge me to yield, while other views, and 
the feelings of my family, might be strongly opposed 
to it. My opinion, however, of the utility, as well as 
of the practicability, of the plan proposed for introducing the arts of husbandry and civilization among 
the Indians, remains the same. It was an opinion 
not hastily formed. But, lest a partiality for a project of my own should mislead my judgment, I submitted it to the examination of two or three gentlemen of discernment ; and it received their approbation, 
before I would venture to give you the trouble of 
reading a long letter about it. 
</p><p>
Although, Sir, I have declined the proposed permanent agency in Indian affairs, I have not withdrawn 
my views from public life, but should cheerfully engage in it, whenever an opening for useful employment, more beneficial than the offices I hold under 
the State, shall present. Two of these offices are 
now rendered certain, by recent reappointments, somewhat unexpectedly made. But they are all of too 
little value for me to depend on during the rest of 
my life. Whenever, therefore, any suitable employment shall offer, I shall feel myself peculiarly obliged 
by your remembrance of me. 
</p><p>
With the most sincere respect, I am. Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
