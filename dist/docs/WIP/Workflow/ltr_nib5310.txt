My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . My theory in regard to the present condition of 
the country is in a few words this. For the last few years 
the Executive power of the Govt. has been weilded by a mere 
gang of banditte. I know these people perfectly keep the 
police on them constantly and in my deliberate judgment, 
there is not on the face of the earth a more profligate crew 
than those who now govern the President. The question is 
how to expel them. I believe that a very large majority not 
merely of the intelligence and the property, but of the numbers of our countrymen, are disposed to expel them. It re 
mains to see how that majority can be concentrated so as to 
be effectual. As yet the opinions of the opposition are unformed. No man as yet can combine them : they are not fixed 
on any one man. But they are fixed on several men who are 
acceptable to various sections. Then the obvious course is, to 
make these several men in the first instance embody under 
them the force of these various sections and when the 
common enemy approaches to rally under a leader of their 
own choice. It is manifestly advantageous to let <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> lead the New England forces, Mr White the Southwest, 
or South and wherever in any one State there is a strong 
opposition man to vote for him as such and settle the 
pretensions of the chiefs afterwards. I have said again and 
again to my friends, I have said it this very morning, "This 
disease is to be treated as a local disorder apply local 
remedies if Gen'l Harrison will run better than any body else in Penns a ., by all means unite upon him." That as far as I 
understand the case, is the feeling very generally of the op 
position &amp; Gen'l Harrison must not suppose that there is in 
this quarter any unwillingness to give him fair play. On the 
contrary, he is very much respected, and if our friends are 
satisfied that he can get more votes in Penns a than any other 
candidate of the opposition they will take him up cheerfully 
&amp; support him cordially. 
</p><p>
I have but one remark more to make. If Gen'l Harrison is taken up as a candidate, it will be on account of the past, not the future. Let him then rely entirely on the past. Let 
I him say not one single word about his principles, or his creed 
V let him say nothing promise nothing. Let no Committee, no convention no town meeting ever extract from 
him a single word, about what he thinks now, or what he will do hereafter. Let the use of pen and ink be wholly forbidden 
as if he were a mad poet in Bedlam. Gen'l Harrison can speak well &amp; write well but on this occasion he should neither 
speak nor write but be silent absolutely and inflexibly silent. . . .
