DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I think with you that there cannot be the least Occasion 
for my explaining your Method of impregnating water with 
fix'd air to Messrs. Banks and Solander, as they were present 
and I suppose are as well acquainted with it as myself ; however, I shall readily do it, if they think it necessary. I am 
glad you intend to improve and publish the Process. 
</p><p>
You must go half an Inch farther with your Spark to 
exceed what I show'd here with my <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> Machine 
in <a href='/results.php?year=1758'>1758</a> to Lord Charles Cavendish and others, who judg'd 
them to be nine Inches. My Cushion was of Buckskin 
with a long damp flap, and had a Wire from it thro' the Window down to the Iron Rails in the Yard ; the Conductor of 
Tin 4 feet long and about 4 Inches Diameter. So powerful 
a Machine had then never been seen in England before, as 
they were pleas'd to tell me. A Machine was made from 
mine for Mr. Simmer, and was afterwards in the Possession 
of Lord Morton: A more convenient Construction I have 
never since seen, except that of yours. I intend soon to repeat 
Barletti's experiments, being provided with the Requisites, 
and shall let you know the Result. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to see the French Translation of your 
Book. Can you conveniently lend it to me when you have 
perus'd it? I fancy it was translated at the Request of 
Abbe' Nollet by a Friend & Disciple of his as I know there 
was one (whose Name I have forgotten) that us'd to translate 
for him Extracts of English Electrical Books. 
</p><p>
The Abbe''s Machine was a very bad one, requiring three 
Persons to make the smallest Experiment, one to turn the 
great Wheel, and one to hold Hands on the Globe. And the 
Effect after all but weak. De lor had a similar one, and 
invited me to see him exhibit to the Duchess of Rochefoucauld but the Weather being a little warm, he could perform 
nothing, scarce obtaining a Spark. 
</p><p>
This Inconvenience must have occasioned his making 
fewer Experiments, & of course his not being so easily convinced. M. Le Roy, however, got early possession of the 
Truth, & combated for it with Nollet ; yet I think the Academy rather favoured the latter. Le Roy will, I suppose, 
now confute this translator, for I have just seen a Letter of 
his to Mr. Magelhaens, thanking him for sending so excellent 
an Electrical Machine to France ; (it is one of the Plate ones) 
which he has improved so as to produce the positive and negative electricities separately or together at the same time, 
"de fafon" (says he) "qu'on peut faire toutes les experiences 
possibles sur Tune ou Pautre de ces deux e'lectricite's. Enfin 
on e"toit si eloigne' de connoitre les phe'nomenes de ces deux 
electricite's ici, faute de machines commodes de les demontrer, 
que beaucoup des gens ont e'te' e'tonne's de voir avec quelle 
evidence ils e'tablissent la distinction de ces deux e'lectricite's," 
&c. This Letter is of the 5th instant. 
</p><p>
My best Wishes attend you and yours. I am ever, with 
great Respect, my dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most sincerely, 
</p><p>
B. F[RANKLIN.]
