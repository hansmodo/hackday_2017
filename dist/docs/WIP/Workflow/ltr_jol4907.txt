I had the pleasure of writing to you yesterday by 
Col Morgan, and the day before by Baron Frey, a 
stranger lately arrived from France who is gone to 
offer his service to Congress. The cannonading 
heard day before yesterday was between the Somerset 
64 Gun Ship, the Roebuck and some other vessel on 
the one part, and our row-gallies seconded by a two 
gun battery on the other the affair was as follows : 
</p><p>
The above mentioned vessels advanced towards our 
chevaux de frise Gen'l Varnum had thrown up a 
fascine battery on a commanding piece of ground 
below Red-bank, and order'd an eighteen pounder 
and a twelve pounder to be moved into it. The 
eighteen pounder was overset in its way, which 
accident prevented its arrival before two o clock. In the intermediate time, however, the piece of twelve, 
was well employed the ships dropped down to the 
distance of a mile and a half from the battery, and 
the Somerset ran aground, in which situation she 
underwent a constant Fire from the Battery, which 
Gen'l Varnnm thinks must have injur'd her exceedingly. She made several signals of distress, upon 
which our Commodore with a great force advanced 
towards her and made a dreadful hut ineffectual 
roaring with his cannon the Roebuck, with the third 
vessel whose name I dont recollect and a galley, 
brought their bow guns to bear on our fleet and 
kept them at a respectful distance. The flood made, 
and the Somerset moved slowly off under cover of the 
other ships. She received farewell salutes from the 
battery as long as she continued within reach.

Our anxiety had been raised in camp, by a report 
that a heavy firing of musquetry had been heard for a 
considerable time on the evening of the same day 
it turns out to be nothing more than a few single guns which Potter's militia and the enemy's detachment 011 Province Island make a practice of firing 
at each other without com 8 to any action. Four 
deserters from the enemy brought in this morning, say 
that the militia men call'd to the British soldiers and 
invited them to go over, promising them beef and 
flour the red-coats in return ask'd them to come 
and partake of their salt that from raillery they 
proceeded to abuse- and at length to discharging 
their pieces at each other, without any other effect as 
far as they know than wounding a Hessian yager.

There have been several women from Ph a within 
two days past, who have applied for leave to pass into 
the country declaring that unless this indulgence 
be granted to them, they must inevitably starve. 
Our humane General says he will grant their request 
upon condition that they do not return into the city, 
and I believe directions are given for that purpose to 
the officers commanding sub-posts, who have hitherto 
stopt them.

Rubenhaupt, the Dutch general who conducted the 
celebrated siege of Grave, shielded by national phlegm 
against any impression from female and infantine distress, rudely sent back into the town crowds of 
women and children, who presented themselves in his 
camp to entreat that he would deliver them from the 
horrors of famine by suffering them to pass his lines. 
</p><p>
The polite and gallant Prince of Conde, upon a 
similar application, when he was particularly called 
upon not to act inconsistently with the amiable 
characteristic of his countrymen the women of the 
besieged town who petitioned his leave to quit it, 
saying " they were persuaded a French Nobleman 
could not be so impolite as to reject the prayer of 
unfortunate ladies " dexterously parried this artful 
address to his feelings as a Frenchman, by replying 
that "he could not consent to deprive himself of the 
most desirable part of his conquest." 
</p><p>
I write this to go by James, who came to Head 
Quarters this morning to see me and take my commands. I happen'd to be out with the General when 
he arrived, and did not know of his being here till 
after dinner, which according to our late hour, made 
it near evening and as I had a second ride to take 
I detained him for the rest of the day. Mrs. Hartley 
is too far from camp for me to pay her my respects. 
If James returns that way, I will write her a note of 
thanks for her care of your letter of 26th Octob'r which 
I received yesterday. 
</p><p>
8th. His Excellency detains James in order to write 
by him to Congress I congratulate you, upon your 
succession to the Presidentship, tho we shall not 
know you in that capacity at Head Quarters till you 
are announced. 
</p><p>
Permit me to say, that I have the honour to be 
with as much respect for your public station, as any 
citizen in the United States, and with an increasing 
flow of filial affection. 
</p><p>
Your dutiful son,

I wrote yesterday to St. Mary Axe, under cover to 
Babut and Labouchere, by way of <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, and 
committed my packet to the care of Col Morgan. 
</p><p>
Since writing as above, I have received your kind 
favor of the 4th .
