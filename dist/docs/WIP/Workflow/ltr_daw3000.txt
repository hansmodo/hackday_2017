SIR, 
</p><p>
I have with me at this place four hundred and 
fifty of my regiment. I should before this time 
have returned to my station at Haerlem, but <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> having ordered the three companies raised 
upon this end of Long Island for the Continental service to join their regiment at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, the 
County Committee requested me to remain here till the return of an express, which they sent to New 
York, to beg of their Congress, if possible, to prevent the three companies from being removed. The 
express has now returned, with liberty for the companies to remain here ten days from last Friday. 
It is thought best that I keep my station near New 
York, though I shall not return there till I know 
the destination of the fleet, which I understand, from 
your Excellency's information to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a>; 
has sailed out of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I hope and expect such 
measures will be pursued, as will prevent their 
taking the stock from this, or the adjacent islands. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants here think that, had <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> known their very exposed situation, he 
would not have ordered the companies away. The <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Congress suppose they have no right to counteract his orders. They might indeed have sent 
to him, and received an answer in season, but they are so refined in their policy, have so many private views to answer, and take such infinite pains to 
keep out of the plain path, conscious, perhaps, of their own superior wisdom, that they do nothing like other people. It is now too late to send to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>. The Committee of Safety have therefore 
desired me to request your Excellency to continue their troops upon this station. I shall only say, that I know of no place so much exposed to the ravages 
of the enemy; and if the companies raised here, who have a great part of the good arms in the country, should be removed, and their places not supplied, I 
know of none so defenceless as this. It is my opinion, after all the soldiers are gone, that two hundred men might ravage the country, notwithstanding 
all the inhabitants could do to prevent it. From this representation I doubt not your Excellency will think proper to continue the troops raised here upon 
this station, or order others in their room. I am, with great truth and regard, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient humble servant,
