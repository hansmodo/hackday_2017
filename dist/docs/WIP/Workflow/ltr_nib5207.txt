Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . The view which I have of the true policy of the 
Bank is this. We have had enough &amp; more than enough of 
banking in the interior. We have been crippled &amp; almost 
destroyed by it. It is time to concenter our business to 
bank where there is some use &amp; some profit in it, and there 
fore (while anxious to do business in the interior the moment there is clear prospect of doing it usefully &amp; safely) 
to make at present the large commercial Cities the principal 
scene of our operations. With this impression my object is 
to give to the Office at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> the command of the business of N. York to make it the first banking institution 
there. To this it is entitled from its Capital its resources, 
and the character of its Direction. But it never can have the 
power which it ought to possess, if it suffers itself to be 
crowded out of its proper sphere by the State Banks &amp; 
to be constantly preyed upon by them. It would be desirable too that it should keep its means as much as possible to itself except what may be necessary for profit 
able exchange operations, &amp; as far as possible avoid having large balances from Southern Offices. . . .
