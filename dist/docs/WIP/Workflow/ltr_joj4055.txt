Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Permit me to introduce to you a gentleman who is going to help you to pay tuxes, and to participate in the liberties 
which render them necessary, viz. Mr. Joshua Grigley. Mr. Vaughan writes me that this gentleman has considerable property, which you know will qualify him for the 
post, and that he has also much virtue and merit, which will enable him to sustain, as well as to enjoy, the latter. Thus, 
you see, he will be an addition to our collective property and respectability, and, consequently, comes naturally within your two departments of financier and patriot. 
</p><p>
But you have also another department to which I must take the liberty of recommending this gentleman. He is a friend of Mr. Vaughan — he is a gentleman — he is a stranger 
— he is young. I know you too well to enlarge, or to add any thing except an assurance, with which I could, with as 
little hesitation, conclude my days as my letter, viz. that I am, with great esteem and affectionate regard, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, your friend and servant, 
</p><p>
