Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received a letter from the Minister of 
France, of which the inclosed is a copy. Having 
full authority from you in relation to payments to 
France, and there being funds out of which that which 
will constitute the succour requested may with propriety be made, and being fully persuaded that, in 
so urgent and calamitous a case, you will be pleased 
with a ready acquiescence in what is desired, I have 
not hesitated to answer the Minister that the sum he 
asks is at his command. 
</p><p>
With the most perfect respect and truest attachment, I have the honor to be, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
