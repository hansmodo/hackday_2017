SIR, 
</p><p>
I imagine your excellency has been informed, that in 
consequence of the resolution of congress for granting commissions to aid-de-camps appointed under the former establishment, I have obtained one of lieutenant colonel in the 
army of the United States, bearing rank since the first of 
March, 1777. 
</p><p>
It is become necessary to me to apply to your excellency, 
to know in what manner you foresee you will be able to 
employ me in the ensuing campaign. I am ready to enter 
into activity whenever you think proper ; though I am not 
anxious to do it till the army takes the field, as before that 
period I perceive no object. 
</p><p>
Unconnected as I am with any regiment, I can have no 
other command than in a light corps, and I flatter myself 
my pretensions to this are good. 
</p><p>
Your excellency knows I have been in actual service 
since the beginning of '76. I began in the line, and had I 
continued there, I ought, in justice, to have been more advanced in rank than I now am. I believe my conduct in 
the different capacities in which I have acted, has appeared 
to the officers of the army in general such as to merit their 
confidence and esteem ; and I cannot suppose them to be 
so ungenerous as not to see me with pleasure put into a 
situation still to exercise the disposition I have always had, 
of being useful to the United States. I mention these things 
only to show that I do not apprehend the same difficulties 
can exist in my case, (which is peculiar,) that have opposed 
the appointment to commands of some other officers, not 
belonging to what is called the line. 
</p><p>
Though the light infantry is chiefly formed, yet being 
detached to the southward, I take it for granted there will 
be a van guard by detachment formed for this army. 
I have the honour to be, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your excellency's most obedient servant,
