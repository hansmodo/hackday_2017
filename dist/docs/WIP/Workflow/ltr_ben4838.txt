DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
I received your Favour by Mr. D. Kuhn but being then 
just setting out on a Tour thro' Ireland and Scotland, I had not time to answer it. Mr. Kuhn I believe went directly 
to Sweden. I shall, if he returns hither while I am here, 
gladly render him any Service in my Power.

I suppose your Son Richard will spend some time in London, where by what I have heard, Physic and Surgery may 
be studied to as great Advantage as in any Part of the World, 
by Attending the Anatomical Lectures and Hospitals, conversing with the most eminent Practitioners, and Reading 
under their Advice and Direction: And yet the General Run is at present to Edinburgh ; there being at the Opening 
of the Schools when I was there in November last, a much 
greater Number of medical Students than had ever been 
known before. They have indeed a Set of Able Professors 
in the several Branches, if common Opinion may be rely'd on. 
I who am no Judge in that Science, can only say that I found 
them very sensible Men, and agreable Companions. I will 
endeavour to obtain Sir John Pringle's Advice in the Affair, 
as you desire. Every Wednesday Evening he admits young 
Physicians and Surgeons to a Conversation at his House, 
which is thought very improving to them. I will endeavour 
to introduce your Son there when he comes to London. And 
to tell you frankly my Opinion, I suspect there is more 
valuable knowledge in Physic to be learnt from the honest 
candid Observations of an old Practitioner, who is past all 
desire of more Business, having made his Fortune, who has 
none of the Professional Interest in keeping up a Parade of 
Science to draw Pupils, and who by Experience has discovered the Inefficacy of most Remedies and Modes of Practice, 
than from all the formal Lectures of all the Universities upon 
Earth. I like therefore a Physician's breeding his Son to 
Medicine, and wish the Art to be continued with the Race, 
as thinking that must be upon the whole most for the Publick Welfare.

When I was last at your House I observed that the Paint 
of the Picture you had was all cracked. I complain'd of 
it to the Painter. He acknowledged that in that Picture, and 
three others, he had made Trial of a new Vernish which had 
been Attended with this mischievous Effect; and offer'd 
to make Amends, if I would sit to him again, by drawing a 
new Picture gratis, only on this Condition, that the old one 
should be returned to him. I wrote this to Mrs. Franklin, 
who should have acquainted you with it, but I suppose forgot 
it. He was 5 or 6 Years in finishing it, having much other 
Business. If therefore you like the new one best, please to 
put the old one in a Box, and send it by the next Ship hither, 
as the Painter expects to have one or the other returned.

Mr. Small, an ingenious Gentleman, now gone to Jamaica, 
has bequeathed to our Society, some Journals of the Weather 
which he kept there with great Accuracy, which I shall send 
you as soon as they come into my Hands. With this you will 
receive a Circular Scheme for noting the Variations of the 
Barometer, and comparing them in different and distant 
Places, which he recommends to be used by the Members of 
the Society that inhabit different Provinces, as he conceives 
that some curious and useful Discoveries in Meteorology 
may thence arise. I send also a Box from Mr. Ludlam, containing some Books which he presents to the Society; a 
Parcel with some Books presented by Mr. Forster; another with two Volumes of the Philosophical Transactions presented 
to our Society by the Royal Society here, in Return for the 
Volume you sent them. I inclose Mr. Forster's l Letter, a 
Letter of Thanks from the Society of Arts, and a Letter from 
Mr. Ludlam. Dr. Smith in a Letter which came with the 
Books, gave me to expect another Box with Copies for the 
learned Societies abroad; and a few spare ones for my 
Friends ; but they are not yet come to hand ; and I am often 
ask'd by the Curious how it happens that none are to be 
bought here. 
</p><p>
I hope soon to receive them, and have no doubt but it will 
procure us the Correspondence of those Societies.

I thank you for the inaugural Dissertation, and am pleas' d 
to see our School of Physic begin to make a Figure. I know 
not why it should not soon be equal to that in Edinburgh. 
I am much oblig'd to the young gentleman who has done me 
the Honour to inscribe his Performance to me. I wish him 
the Success his Ingenuity seems to promise him. 
</p><p>
My Love to Mrs. Bond and your Children. I condole 
with you both most sincerely on the great Loss you have 
lately sustained. 
</p><p>
With the truest Esteem and Regard, I am ever, my 
dear Friend 
</p><p>
Yours most Affectionately 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN 
</p><p>
The Parcels are in the care of Mr. Bache.
