SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor of imparting to your Excellency 
the arrival of the King's fleet, charged by his Majesty with the glorious task of giving his allies, the 
United States of America, the most striking proofs 
of his affection. Nothing will be wanting to my happiness, if I can succeed in it. It is augmented by 
the consideration of concerting my operations with a 
General such as your Excellency. The talents and 
great actions of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> have insured 
him, in the eyes of all Europe, the title, truly sublime, 
of Deliverer of America. Accept, Sir, the homage that 
every man, that every military man, owes you ; and 
be not displeased that I solicit, even in the first 
moment of intercourse, with military and maritime 
frankness, a friendship so flattering as yours. I will 
try to render myself worthy of it by my respectful 
devotion for your country. It is prescribed to me 
by orders, and my heart inspires it. 
</p><p>
I have the honor of rendering an account to Congress of the letter I write to your Excellency. M. de Chouin, Major of Infantry in the King's service, 
has orders to present you this. I pray you to grant 
the most extensive confidence to all this officer shall 
tell you on my part. He is a near relation to M. de Sartine. This Minister has been long since known 
for his attachment to the common cause. It is less 
the desire of pleasing a statesman, honored with the 
confidence of the King, which has determined me to 
send to you M. Chouin, than an opinion of his military knowledge, the clearness of his ideas, and the 
precision with which he will communicate mine. I 
beseech you to grant him your kindness. I have the 
honor to be, with respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant,
