Dear Frank, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 1st of January last was delivered to 
me yesterday, and gives me pleasure. You do well to look 
forward to the means of exercising your profession to 
advantage. You shall continue to have my aid and protection, in such measure and season, as circumstances may 
render proper and expedient. 
</p><p>
You belong to a large and helpless family, and I wish to 
see you as able, as I hope you would be willing, to provide 
for them. 
</p><p>
I think with you, that on the evacuation of New-York, 
you may set up a press there with a good prospect of success. On speaking to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> yesterday about it, he 
told me that when the enemy left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, they carried 
from thence to New- York, a printing-press of his, and that 
it is now in the possession of one Robinson, a printer, at 
New-York. As by the provisional treaty the British forces 
are not to carry away any effects of the inhabitants, this 
press may perhaps be recovered. The Dr. has desired me 
to prepare a letter of attorney for the purpose, to some person in New-York, and in case it should be restored, will 
lend it to you. I shall immediately think of furnishing you 
with some types, and <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> has promised his assistance, so that you may soon expect to hear from me again 
about these matters. In the mean time, write a letter of 
thanks t<> the Dr. for his kind attention. 
</p><p>
I must remind you that you should extend your application beyond the mere mechanical [-art of your business. 
You will have to compose as well as to print, and you 
should take pains not only to store your mind with useful 
knowledge, but also to acquire the talent of writing in a 
clear, concise, and accurate style. Remember too, that an 
acquaintance with accounts, and the method of keeping 
them, is not to be neglected. It is important to all men, 
and particularly to those who cannot afford to be careless. 
If you are industrious, prudent, and punctual in the conduct 
of your business, you will most certainly succeed ; and my 
desire of helping you, instead of abating, will be increased 
by your endeavours to help yourself. 
</p><p>
I am, with sincere regard, dear Frank, 
</p><p>
Your friend and servant, 
</p><p>
