DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your Excellency's confidential 
letter of the 3d instant on the 12th, at <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a>, 
whither I was called by an alarm on the frontiers 
of Ulster county, occasioned by the appearance of 
about one hundred Indians and Tories, at Shendeacon, a small settlement in the gorge of the mountains, 
about twenty miles west of <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a>, and twelve 
from Marbletown. They were joined at this place by 
twenty-seven Tories from the east of Hudson's River. 
mostly Hessian deserters from the Convention troops. 
The sudden assembling of the militia deterred them 
from penetrating farther into the country, and prevented them from doing any material injury. 
</p><p>
It is needless to remark to your Excellency, that 
the execution of military business by militia officers 
is (from the want of activity and knowledge) seldom 
attended with the necessary despatch. Add to this, 
the raising of the levies for the defence of the fron 
tiers, and for filling up the Continental battalions, 
has been unavoidably much interrupted and retarded, 
in the frontier regiments, by almost continual alarms, 
since the departure of Colonel Cortlandt's regiment 
from the former station. I have, therefore, found it 
necessary to order the levies in this county to rendezvous on the western frontiers of Ulster and Orange 
counties, to serve as a cover to the settlements, and 
to afford the militia leisure to make their drafts. The 
officer who commands them has orders, the moment 
this is accomplished, to forward such part of them as 
are to be annexed to the Continental battalions, with 
such additional number as can be spared, consistent 
with the security of the frontier settlements in that 
quarter, to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, by detachments, without the least 
delay. From the best information I have been able 
to obtain, there is a collection of Indians (consisting 
of those who are called Esopus Indians and other 
stragglers) and Tories, at Shohawken and Kollitye, 
on the Delaware, at one of which places it is said 
they have erected a block-house, or some other small 
works of defence. Our accounts were, that they consisted of upwards of one hundred, and we have the 
best evidence of their having been lately joined by a very considerable additional number of Tories and 
deserters. It is this banditti, that have committed 
the most of the mischiefs which have been done in 
the counties of Ulster and Orange, and have occasioned all the late distressing alarms. They are supplied 
with provisions from the different settlements on the 
Delaware by the disaffected inhabitants who live on 
the frontiers. They are perfectly acquainted with the 
back country, and, I am apprehensive, will be very 
troublesome, by rendering the supplies to our western 
army precarious, and by keeping the back settlements 
in perpetual apprehensions of danger. 
</p><p>
The amazing tract of uninhabited and mountainous 
country, which lies between the intended route of 
our army and the western settlements, will afford 
them a secure asylum, as long as they can procure 
provisions. I would therefore submit to your Excellency the propriety of marching a body of men into 
these parts, sufficiently large to scour that country, 
and rout the enemy there, and destroy the settlements which feed and harbour them. As these settlements are scattered and remote from each other, 
and as the enemy may be succoured from the contiguous Indian settlements on the Suscjuehanna, not 
less than five hundred men will be competent to 
perform this business effectually. If the measure is 
approved by your Excellency, I will most readily 
furnish that number from the militia for this short 
service, and undertake to conduct the business my 
self. Nothing will be wanted, but the means of 
transporting about ten days or two weeks provision, 
and some other little matters from the Quarter-master's department, which cannot be obtained otherwise, 
and which, I presume, may be spared from thence, 
without inconveniency, for so short a period. The 
horses wanted may either be impressed in the country by the Quarter-master, or, if purchased, returned 
before the campaign is fairly opened on the sea-coast. 
I am the more desirous of having this business 
accomplished, as it will relieve the inhabitants of the 
frontier settlements from any farther apprehensions of 
danger, and induce many, who have already abandoned 
their farms, to return to them, and also enable us to 
spare a greater proportion of the levies, raised for 
the defence of the frontiers, who are now stationed 
at the different passes, where they at best afford but a very partial security, for active service. It may 
be thought most advisable to delay the matter until 
the army, intended for the western service, begin to 
move ; in which case this may serve as a favorable 
diversion. The intermediate time may be only sufficient to get out the men and make the necessary 
preparations. I have the honor to be, with the most 
perfect respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
