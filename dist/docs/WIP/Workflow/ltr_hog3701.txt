Sir, 
</p><p>
I had, the day before yesterday, the honor of receiving your Excellency's letter, dated the 8th of 
August, from Orangetown. It gave me infinite satisfaction to find you had baffled Sir Harry Clinton's 
designs, and was, to all appearance, in so prosperous 
a situation. Heaven grant you the greatest honor 
and success ! 
</p><p>
As to the situation of affairs here, since my last 
letter to your Excellency of the 3Oth ultimo, I can 
only say no considerable alteration has taken place, 
the enemy remaining still, and the disaffected doing 
nothing of consequence to disturb us. Fourteen hundred of the second draft of the militia of this State 
are marched to cover Salisburg, and the country from 
thence to Charlotte, where Colonel Sumpter has a command, which occasionally acts upon the west side of 
the Wateree, and has hitherto given such a jealousy 
to the British in Camden as to keep them at home. 
Three hundred Virginia riflemen, under Colonel Campbell, and militia from the back counties, are marching 
to the east bank of the Yadkin, at the ford ; and 
General Stevens, with what have not run home, of 
the other Virginia militia, is at Guilford CourtHouse. The Maryland division and the artillery are 
here, to be refitted ; the former will be put into one 
strong regiment, with a good light infantry company, 
under Colonel Williams. The rest of the officers will 
be sent immediately to Maryland, for the purpose 
directed by your Excellency in your letter to the 
Baron de Kalb, of the 27th June, which came to my 
hands only yesterday, from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, in Virginia. 
General Muhlenberg acquaints me that near five hundred regulars are upon their march from Petersburg 
to this place ; these, with the Marylanders above mentioned, will make us stronger in Continental 
troops than I was before the action. The cavalry, 
under the Colonels White and Washington and Major Nelson, are not quite equipped, so as to be able 
to march to Bock Fish, in the neighbourhood of 
Cross Creek, as I directed ; but I hope they will 
soon be in a condition to obey my orders. 
</p><p>
Colonel Dubuysson, Aid-de-camp to the Baron de Kalb, a most amiable young officer, will soon wait 
upon your Excellency; he was wounded and taken, 
but Lord Cornwallis has permitted him to go to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, on iarole. All the Baron's baggage and 
papers are saved ; they are delivered to Colonel Dubuysson, who will be responsible for them. Too much 
honor cannot be paid by Congress to the memory of 
the Baron de Kalb ; he was every thing an excellent 
officer should be, and, in the cause of the United 
States, has sacrificed his life. 
</p><p>
If I can yet render good service to the United 
States, it will be necessary it should be seen that I 
have the support of Congress and your Excellency ; 
otherwise some men may think they please my superiors by blaming me, and thus recommend themselves 
to favor. But you, Sir, will be too generous to lend 
an ear to such men, if such there be, and will show 
your greatness of soul rather by protecting, than 
slighting, the unfortunate. If, on the contrary, I am 
not supported, and countenance is given to every one 
who will speak disrespectfully of me, it will be better for Congress to remove me at once from a command where I shall be unable to render them any 
good service. This, Sir, I submit to your candor 
and honor, and shall cheerfully await the decision of 
my superiors. With the warmest wishes for your 
prosperity, and the sincerest sentiments of esteem 
and regard, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

P. S. Inclosed are two letters of Lord Bawdon, 
found at the house of Rugely, thirteen miles from 
Camden, to whom they are directed ; which will show your Excellency what dark schemes our enemies fall 
upon, in order to effect their nefarious purposes
