MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 8th instant, I received on a 
journey to Brunswick, on Friday last, where I had 
an opportunity of conferring with our Convention, 
and urging your Excellency's requisition relating to 
the militia, the propriety of which is so obvious. I 
returned on Saturday evening, and delayed answering 
your favor, in hopes of receiving the resolution of the 
Convention thereon. I have just been favored with a 
rough draught of their ordinance, which I shall send 
you as soon as I get a correct copy. 
</p><p>
The outlines are, that the one half of the whole 
militia, without exception, be immediately called out, 
and join the Flying Camp ; that every person refusing  his attendance be fined three pounds ; that they 
be formed into thirteen battalions, and to remain on 
service one month, and then to be relieved by the other half. 
</p><p>
There being no mention made of any number to be forwarded to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I take it for granted the 
whole are to be under your Excellency's direction as to their station, &c. 
</p><p>
The two thousand men for the Flying Camp, under 
General Dickinson, are in great forwardness, and (although very little acquainted with their duty) might 
answer a valuable purpose in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, on the present emergency, especially as their places will be so 
soon filled by the half of the militia now to be 
raised. A considerable body of the militia must be 
kept here to supply the place of the Pennsylvania 
Associators, who are deserting their post in consider 
able numbers, notwithstanding the most spirited exertion. of their officers, and particularly their Colonel, 
whose behaviour does honor to his Province in particular, and America in general. 
</p><p>
We have taken such measures as I hope will put 
a stop to any further behaviour of this kind. This 
corps, since our militia were dismissed, have not carried on any of the works at the Point, which, as 
soon as they are relieved by any men under my 
command, I shall order to be prosecuted with all 
possible vigor ; as, it is more than probable, the enemy will attempt an incursion into this Province, 
to which its present defenceless state, in this part, 
seems strongly to invite them. I am, with much 
truth and regard, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant,
