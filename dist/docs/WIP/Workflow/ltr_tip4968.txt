CAMP NEAR <a href='/results.php?city=potsgrove' rel='city origin'>POTSGROVE</a>, thirty-four miles above <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
</p><p>
Near the River Schuylkill, <a rel="month origin" value="9">September</a> <a rel='day origin' value='25'>25th</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1777' rel="origin">1777</a> .

... Although our loss in the battle of Brandywine 
was not so great as the enemy s,* yet since then it has been 
much larger; I mean by straggling and desertions, which, I 
am satisfied, have reduced the army more than the bare 
action. After that battle we returned to within seven miles 
of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, rested two nights, cleaned our arms, furnished each man with forty rounds of well-made cartridges, 
then recrossed the Schuylkill, and, after several marches, 
were one day overtaken by a most severe rain. The army 
had just been arrayed for battle, the enemy approaching. It 
was judged best to shift our ground for a position more 
advantageous. It began to rain ; the enemy halted ; we 
marched ten miles in a continual rain and bad roads ; arrived 
late in the evening at Yellow Springs ; men fatigued, arms 
wet, ammunition chiefly spoiled (perhaps three hundred 
thousand cartridges) ; no covering for the men (the tents 
having been sent off when the battle was expected) ; rain 
all night and part of next day ; another march to Reading 
Furnace ; then we returned, and again crossed the Schuylkill in order to obstruct the passage of the enemy, leaving 
one division, under <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='co-worker'>General Wayne</a>, behind, to hang upon 
their rear. The second or third night the enemy fell upon 
Wayne ; they exchanged one fire, close ; pushed bayonets ; 
Wayne retired ; the enemy did not pursue, but retired also. 
Next day Wayne buried fifty-six of his men, and the in 
habitants said the enemy buried twenty-three of theirs, and 
carried off four or five wagon-loads. 
</p><p>
Information that the enemy were proceeding up the Schuylkill on the [west] side induced us to march up like 
wise on this side. We got above them, and then they 
crossed below us at Swedes Ford. We wait for Wayne to 
join us, and McDougall with his brigade from <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. 
We shall, I expect, unite to-morrow. 
</p><p>
Six o clock P. M. I have just heard that the enemy have 
dropped down to-day within twelve miles of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
The city is open to them. The day before yesterday I pro 
posed, in presence of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='co-worker met'>General Knox</a>, 
&c., that at least one company of artillerymen and a sufficient number of musketeers should be sent down to garrison 
the fort below the city, which defends the chevaux-de-frise. 
His Excellency assented to the propriety of the measure ; 
yet nothing was done. However, yesterday it was judged 
of the highest importance to garrison that fort. Accordingly, two hundred musketeers and two good artillery 
officers were despatched to cross the Delaware at Bristol. 
Had this step been taken when I proposed it, it might have 
been executed without a circuitous march to Bristol, for 
the enemy had not then crossed the Schuylkill. However, 
I trust it will still be effected with safety. If the fort is as 
tenable as represented, I presume the enemy will not speedily pass the chevaux-de-frise ; and, if Howe is not aided by 
the fleet, he will not long possess <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I am persuaded. But, from the account given by others, it seems 
that a height on the Jersey shore, a mile from the fort 
(which is near the opposite shore, back of which the large 
meadows are now laid under water) , may be taken possession of by the enemy, from which, by their guns and 
mortars, they may prevent the galleys defending the chevaux-de-frise, and possibly make the fort too warm for our men. 
But surely the fort, at the distance of a mile, must be safe 
from everything but bombs, and I should not fear much from 
them alone. 
</p><p>
To-day it rains. To-morrow morning, at nine o clock, 
we march and join McDougall. Pretty soon, I imagine, we 
shall proceed to attack the enemy, if their post be practicable. Were Howe, with his present force, in New England, 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> with so many Continental troops 
as he will have when joined by Wayne and McDougall, I 
should not wish for a better opportunity to crush him ; for 
we should have there the best intelligence, and as many 
militia as we desired for a short, bold push ; but here we 
are, in fact, in an enemy's country. I am told upwards of 
sixty-five thousand men are enrolled in the militia of Pennsylvania; yet we have not two thousand in the field, and 
these are of little worth and constantly deserting. After 
the action of the 11th, and the enemy took possession of 
Wilmington, almost all the militia of Delaware State also 
ran home. Some Maryland militia join us to-morrow, per 
haps a thousand men. Many that marched from home have 
deserted. Other militia are coming from Virginia and Jersey, together with a stout and good State regiment from 
Virginia, the latter perhaps now at Lancaster. The Jersey 
militia have been at war a year, are embittered against the 
foe, and have constantly behaved well in Jersey. But be 
fore all the militia arrives, I presume we shall be engaged, 
lest the fleet should get to the city. 
</p><p>
I had heard at home of so much contempt and ridicule 
thrown by the southern gentlemen on the New England 
militia, that I expected something better here ; but no militia 
can be more contemptible than those of Pennsylvania and 
Delaware ; none can be spoken of more contemptuously than 
they are by their own countrymen. And how astonishing 
is it, that not a man is roused to action when the enemy is 
in the heart of the country, and within twelve miles of their 
grand capital, of so much importance to them and the Continent ! How amazing, that Howe should march from the 
head of Elk to the Schuylkill, a space of sixty miles, with 
out opposition from the people of the country, except a 
small band of militia just round Elk ! Such events would 
not have happened in New England. I rejoice that I can 
call that my country. I think myself honored by it. I 
hope I shall not do anything to detract from the applauses justly its due. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants here have, of a long time, been the 
most abominable extortioners ; and where Howe has passed 
they refuse to take paper money. The villains in Chester 
county (between the Schuylkill and the Brandy wine) refuse even to supply our poor wounded men among them 
with necessary provisions, without the solid coin; and our 
surgeons have been obliged to carry provisions to them from 
hence. I feel in some degree reconciled to Howe's entering 
Pennsylvania and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, that the unworthy inhabit 
ants (of which tis apparent a majority of the State is com 
posed) may experience the calamities of war, which nothing 
but their own supineness and unfriendliness to the American 
cause would have brought on them. Possibly Heaven permits it in vengeance for their defection, that their country 
should be the seat of war. Not that I have a great opinion 
of the morality of the Americans in general ; but there are 
surely none who have not more public virtue than the Pennsylvanians. However, did the event of the contest depend 
on the goodness, the moral virtue, of my countrymen, I 
should despair of success. But, for the justice of our cause 
and the sake of the righteous in the land, I hope, and I 
doubt not, God will in the end grant us victory, and a 
consequent happy peace. Yet perhaps many trials await 
us. All our afflictions have not taught us humility. Every 
species of vice has rather prevailed since the war began. In 
short, look where you will, there is so much evil, that a good 
man would scarcely wish to live, were it not for the pleasures he enjoys in the small circle of his nearest friends. I 
sometimes wonder we are so fond of life, when we almost 
daily meet with something to vex our souls. But, doubt 
less, Shakespeare has assigned the true reason, an uncertain futurity. Yet this should affect none but infidels ; 
and we have good advice, Fret not because of evil men. 
We must do our duty, and await our appointed time till 
our change comes, enjoying what bounties Heaven pleases 
to bestow.
