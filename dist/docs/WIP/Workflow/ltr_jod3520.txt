MY DEAREST FRTEND, 
</p><p>
WE wait, and wait, and wait forever, without any 
news from America. We get nothing but what comes 
from England and to other people here, and they 
make it as they please. We have had nothing from 
Congress an immense while. Every merchant and 
every merchant's apprentice has letters and news 
when I have none. In truth, I have been so long 
from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> that every body there, almost, has for 
gotten me. I have expected, every moment for al 
most two months, my recall. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, Cornwallis and Eden are arrived in England, but bring no good news for the English, or we 
should have had it in the Gazette. The two houses 
of Parliament join ministry and commissioners in 
threatening fire and sword. They seem to think it 
necessary to threaten most, when they can do least. 
They, however, show their disposition, which they 
will indulge and gratify if they can. But be not dismayed. They can do no great things. Patience, 
perseverance and firmness will overcome all our difficulties. Where the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met acquaintance'>Comte D Estaing</a> is, is a great 
mystery. The greater, the better. The English 
fancy he is returning to Europe. But we believe he 
is gone where he will do something. The English 
reproach the French with gasconade, but they never gasconaded as the English do now. I suppose they 
will say as Burgoyne did, " Speak daggers but use 
none." But I believe, however, that they and he 
would use them if they could. Of all the wrong 
heads Johnstone is the most consummate. The Tories 
at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> have filled his head 
with a million lies. He seems to have taken a <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> newspaper for holy writ. Parliament is adjourned to the 14th January. Of this you may be 
assured, that England can et no allies. The new 
secretary at war makes a vast parade of the number 
of men in their service by sea and land. But it is a 
mere delusion. They intend to byngify Keppel to 
all appearance ; but killing him will not mend rotten ships nor make sailors.

I dined to-day at the Dutchess D Enville's. When I saw the companies of militia on their march to fight her husband, I did not expect this. Did you ?
