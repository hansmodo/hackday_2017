Sir, 
</p><p>
The government of this country having resolved, in execution of the eighth article of the treaty of amity and commerce, 
concluded between the United States of America, and his 
most Christian Majesty, on the sixth day of February, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, 
to employ their good offices with the Regency of Algiers, to 
bring about a treaty of peace, have desired me to nominate 
and appoint some person on the part of the United States, to 
be present and assist at the negotiations to be had and 
made for that purpose ; and, you having consented to under 
take that office, I have by a commission of this day authorised you to negotiate and conclude such treaty on the part of 
the United States of America. It becomes necessary, there 
fore, to explain to you my situation, and thence, as well as 
from the circumstances of the moment, to deduce rules for 
your government. 
</p><p>
And, first, you are to know that my appointment of you is a 
mere assumption of power on my part, no such authority being given to me as that which is implied in your commission. 
I act on this occasion upon the principle, that where great 
public interests are concerned, and when, from .the nature of 
the case, it is impossible that the will of the government can 
be seasonably expressed, the confidential servants of the pub 
lic are in duty bound to imply that will. But your good sense 
will show you, that by reason hereof, a more critical degree of 
responsibility is incurred. And hence results two rules for 
your guidance. 
</p><p>
1. Avoid as much as possible all interference, leaving the 
business to the agents of this government, and only advising 
with them, so as to secure to the utmost the interests of the 
United States, in the treaty which they may be able to conclude. 
</p><p>
2. In any such treaty, whether you do, or do not, appear 
as a Commissioner, take care that it be limited to a short period, (such, for instance, as one year,) unless approved by the 
United States. Such approbation to be expressed by the 
President of the said States, agreeably to the Constitution 
thereof. 
</p><p>
I give you herewith a copy of the treaty concluded between 
the United States and the Emperor of Morocco, which will 
serve as a model or groundwork for you to go by. I expect 
that the Regency of Algiers will be exorbitant in their demands 
of money, as heretofore they have been ; and I presume that 
some unfriendly European powers (I might say unchristian 
powers) may endeavor to counteract you ; the rather, as I am 
informed, that a British Consul in that quarter has declared 
that America will never obtain a treaty with Algiers, but 
through the medium of his government. It is proper, there 
fore, that the business be conducted with the utmost secrecy, 
and that you appear, what by birth you are, a Frenchman, at 
least until some good purpose can be answered by the exhibition of your true character and country. It will be useful to 
inculcate on your companions the same secrecy, which I have 
just requested you to preserve. 
</p><p>
The method by which, as far as I can learn, a treaty has 
hitherto been avoided, and which may perhaps be still pursued 
is, by demanding of the United States a sum of money out of 
all proportion to the object. And as far as it has come to my 
knowledge, the disposition of America is divided between the 
obtaining such treaty by purchase or by force. We have 
heard, I know not with what truth, that the United States are 
fitting out thirty frigates. Be it as it may, the report can be 
turned to account on the present occasion. It may be insinuated to the Dey and his Ministers, that the United States will 
send a fleet into the Mediterranean manned with the best sea 
men in the world, (for such the seamen, natives of America, 
unquestionably are,) with orders to cruise continually and intercept all vessels whatever going to or coming from the port 
of Algiers. That with this fleet are to be connected some 
light armed schooners, and a body of riflemen hunters, whose 
skill, whose activity, and whose courage are unequalled ; that 
this armament will be directed to rendezvous in the port of 
Malta, in order to commence their operations. 
</p><p>
It will be proper to state the greatest amount of all their 
captures from the United States, since the year <a href='/results.php?year=1783'>1783</a> to the 
present hour, and, without making any deductions therefrom 
for the expense of the armaments against our commerce, (and 
which would probably exceed the value of the prizes,) divide 
the same by ten for the number of years. t It will then appear 
of how little value is the object, even could it be longer pursued without risk or inconvenience. It will appear that, if the 
whole amount had gone into the Dey's coffers, he would not 
be much benefitted thereby, and he should be made- to observe, that if the Americans pursue their plan, and obtain, as 
they may, subsidies from the Italian States and others, their 
armaments will cost them nothing, and he will lose the sum he 
now receives for preserving peace with those States. 
</p><p>
The United States have less shipping than is needful to 
carry their produce, and the latter increases faster than the 
former ; so that they can easily forego the commerce of the 
Mediterranean, seeing that they would then be unable to get 
back, of course they could take nothing from us, and would 
lose much by engaging with us. 
</p><p>
From what I have just said, you will see that it is my object 
to obtain a peace with the smallest possible sacrifice of money, 
for nothing, if you can. But whether a treaty be, or be not, 
made, it will be proper to get back the unfortunate men who 
are captives in that country. If a peace be obtained, their re 
lease should be one article of it. If not, you must contrive to 
get them away for as little money as possible. And it would 
be well to obtain such passports as may carry them home, lest 
they should be intercepted in their return. 
</p><p>
Before I conclude, it is proper to mention the expense to 
be incurred on this occasion ; and this I divide into two parts, 
national and personal. This government will make due pro 
vision for the former, and it must be your object to confine it 
within narrow bounds. It is true that neither you nor I can 
incur any responsibility in relation to that object, beause I have 
fully expressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs my total 
want of authority ; and, consequently, their actsare purely their 
own ; but, still, as the United States will be under a kind of 
honorary obligation to discharge the debt, which may thus be 
incurred, it is our duty to render it as light as possible. 
</p><p>
As to your personal expense, I will pay it, and I pray you to 
be as economical as circumstances will permit; for I must 
again repeat to you, that, having no authority to act, if my 
conduct should be disapproved, it is but just that the cost be 
defrayed by me. 
</p><p>
And now, Sir, I commit you to your own understanding and 
discretion, of which you have a plentiful share, and to the 
protection of God. If you succeed, as I hope and believe 
you will, I doubt not you will receive the grateful acknowledgements of America. My thanks are already due for the 
readiness with which you have undertaken this task, which is 
by no means a pleasant or agreeable one. I am, &tc.
