Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
A gentleman in Holland has been so obliging as to send 
me a plan to make my fortune, even to the extent of many 
millions of pounds sterling. It unfortunately happens that 
more mercantile knowledge is necessary to the execution 
of this plan than I possess ; so that, like many others, I 
must go without a fortune for want of knowing how to 
get one. That, my good friend, is not your case ; having 
already made one fortune, you certainly know better how 
to make another than a person who has never made any. 
</p><p>
You will find this golden plan enclosed. If the extensive 
concerns in which you are already engaged should render 
its magnitude inconvenient, might it not be well to let our 
friends Le Roy and Bayard share in it ? I mention them, 
because I esteem and like them, and because their acquaintance with the commerce of Holland, and their connexions 
in that country, would afford facilities to all parties. 
</p><p>
At any rate, give me credit for good-will. If this plan 
does not make you more rich, it will not make you less 
merry ; and mirth sometimes does a man as much good as 
money. 
Present my best compliments to Mrs. Cruger. With 
sincere wishes for your and her health and happiness, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>

P.S. The address of my correspondent is (in his own words) Mynheer de Heer Dirk Van Beest, op de Voor Straat de Dordrecht.
