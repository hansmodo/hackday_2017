SIR, 
</p><p>
This moment an express is arrived from Maryland, 
with an account of near two hundred sail of Mr. 
Howe's fleet, being at anchor in the Chesapeake Bay. 
A copy of the letter, brought by express, I inclose to 
you, and to which I refer you. In consequence of 
this advice, Congress have ordered the immediate removal of all the stores and prisoners from Lancaster 
and York, in this State, to places of greater safety. 
</p><p>
Congress have this moment come to the inclosed 
resolution, to which I beg leave to refer you; and, 
indeed, I need not add, as the whole matter is submitted to you. I will not detain the express only to 
say, that I am, with every sentiment of esteem and 
respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
