Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last to you was of the 14th ult., by the ship Betsey, 
Captain Thomas Watson. Since that time, I have had the 
pleasure of receiving and laying before Congress your 
despatches of the 6th, 8th, and 10th August last. 
</p><p>
We concur so perfectly in sentiment respecting public 
affairs, and what ought to be done, that I find no occasion 
to enlarge on those heads. 
</p><p>
In a late report, I have called the attention of Congress 
to this serious question, viz. whether the United States 
should withdraw their attention from the ocean, and leave 
foreigners to fetch and carry for them, or whether it is more 
their interest to look forward to naval strength and maritime importance, and to take and persevere in the measures 
proper to attain it. 
</p><p>
The diversity of opinions on this point renders it necessary that it should be well considered, and finally decided. 
The eastern and middle States are generally for the latter 
system ; and though the others do not openly avow their 
preferring the former, yet they are evidently inclined to it. 
Hence it is that the most leading men in Congress from 
that quarter do not only not promote measures for vesting 
Congress with power to regulate trade, but, as the common 
phrase is, throw cold water on all such ideas. 
</p><p>
Having few or no ships of their own, they are averse to 
such duties on foreign ones as will greatly advance the 
price of freight ; nor do they seem much disposed to sacrifice any present profits for the sake of their neighbours who 
have ships and wish to have more. 
</p><p>
We have heard much of the Alsrerines havinsr declared 
war against the United States. None of our advices are 
official ; but as the intelligence comes directly from Nantes, 
Bordeaux, and L'Orient, there seems to be much reason to 
fear it is true. 
</p><p>
The public papers herewith sent will inform you of our 
common occurrences ; and I wish it was in my power to 
tell you what Congress mean to do respecting many matters 
on which they are to decide. The representation is at present slender, and will, I suspect, continue so till the new 
members come on. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be 
</p><p>
Your very obedient servant,
</p><p>
