Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
They who regard the public good with more attention and attachment than they do mere personal concerns, must feel and confess the force of such sentiments as are expressed in your letter to me, by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague'>Colonel Humphreys</a>, last fall. The situation of our affairs calls not only for reflection and prudence, 
but for exertion. What is to be done? is a common question; but it is a question not easy to answer. 
</p><p>
Would the giving any further degree of power to Congress do the business ? I am inclined to think it would not. For, among other reasons ; â€” 
</p><p>
It is natural to suppose there will always be members who will find it convenient to make their seats 
subservient to partial and personal purposes ; and 
they who may be able and willing to concert and 
promote useful and national measures, will seldom be 
unembarrassed by the ignorance, prejudices, fears, 
or interested views of others. In so large a body, 
secrecy and despatch will be too uncommon ; and foreign as well as local influence will frequently oppose, 
and sometimes frustrate, the wisest measures. Large 
assemblies often misunderstand or neglect the obligations of character, honor, and dignity ; and will, collectively, do or omit things which individual gentlemen, in private capacities, would not approve. As 
the many divide blame, and also divide credit, too 
little a portion of either falls to each man's share to 
affect him strongly. Even in cases where the whole 
blame or the whole credit must be national, it is not 
easy for those to think and feel as sovereigns, who 
have always been accustomed to think and feel as 
subjects. The executive business of sovereignty, depending on so many wills, and those wills moved by 
such a variety of contradictory motives and inducements, will, in general, be but feebly done. Such a 
sovereign, however theoretically responsible, cannot be 
effectually so, in its departments and officers, without 
adequate judicatories. 
</p><p>
I therefore promise myself nothing very desirable 
from any change which does not divide the sovereignty into its proper departments. Let Congress 
legislate ; let others execute ; let others judge. 
</p><p>
Shall we have a King ? Not, in my opinion, while 
other expedients remain untried. Might we not have 
a Governor-General, limited in his prerogatives and 
duration ? Might not Congress be divided into an 
upper and a lower House ; the former appointed for 
life, the latter annually ; and let the Governor-General (to preserve the balance), with the advice of a 
Council, formed, for that only purpose, of the great 
judicial officers, have a negative on their acts? Our 
Government should, in some degree, be suited to our 
manners and circumstances, and they, you know, are 
not strictly democratical. 
</p><p>
What powers should be granted to the Government, so constituted, is a question which deserves much thought. I think, the more the better ; the States 
retaining only so much as may be necessary for domestic purposes, and all their principal officers, civil and military, being commissioned and removable by 
the National Government. These are short hints. Details would exceed the limits of a letter, and to you be superfluous. 
</p><p>
A Convention is in contemplation, and I am glad 
to find your name among those of its intended members. To me the policy of such a Convention appears questionable. Their authority is to be derived 
from acts of the State Legislatures. Are the State 
Legislatures authorized, either by themselves or others, 
to alter Constitutions ? I think not. They who hold 
commissions can, by virtue of them, neither retrench 
nor extend the powers conveyed by them. Perhaps 
it is intended that this Convention shall not ordain; 
but only recommend. If so, there is danger that 
their recommendations will produce endless discussions, and perhaps jealousies and party heats. 
</p><p>
Would it not be better for Congress, plainly, and 
in strong terms, to declare, that the present Federal 
Government is inadequate to the purposes for which 
it was instituted ; that they forbear to point out 
its particular defects, or to ask for an extension of 
any particular powers, lest improper jealousies should 
thence arise ; but that, in their opinion, it would be 
expedient for the people of the States, without delay, to appoint State Conventions (in the way they 
choose their General Assemblies), with the sole and 
express power of appointing Deputies to a General Convention ; who, or the majority of whom, should 
take into consideration the articles of Confederation, 
and make such alterations, amendments, and additions 
thereto as to them should appear necessary and proper, and which, being by them ordained and published, should have the same force and obligation 
which all or any of the present articles now have? 
</p><p>
No alterations in the Government should, I think, 
be made, nor, if attempted, will easily take place, 
unless deducible from the only source of just authority, the people. 
</p><p>
Accept, my dear Sir, my warmest and most cordial 
wishes for your health and happiness ; and believe 
me to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, &c., 
</p><p>
John Jay.
