MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I AM as much of a solitudinarian as Frederick the 
Conqueror. He was constantly saying at sixty, " Jesuis vieux, casse, surannee," &c., &c., &c. I may 
say the same and have the honor to resemble him in 
this particular, but I shall never imitate his idolatry 
for Voltaire. His materialism appears to me very 
superficial. He insists upon being all matter, without 
knowing what matter is. The monades, the etres 
simples, the atoms, the molecules organiques, all 
these guesses and fictions, are as nonsensical as the 
occult qualities. Human knowledge cannot penetrate 
so deep. I was profoundly learned in all that jargon 
at twenty years of age, but found it all useless, and 
renounced it for fee simple and fee tail. 
</p><p>
Thomas is my delight and I know not how to re 
sign him ; but as I know you will not be quite well 
till you see him, I shall consent to his going next 
week.
