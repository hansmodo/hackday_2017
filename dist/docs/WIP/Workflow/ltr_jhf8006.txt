My dear Sir : I write a line from this place in the hope that by way of Chihuahua and <a href='/results.php?city=vera cruz' rel='city'>Vera Cruz</a>, it will reach you sooner than 
letters by the direct mail from <a href='/results.php?city=santa fe' rel='city'>Santa Fe</a>, and so be in advance of exaggerated reports of the events which have delayed my journey, and turned me in this direction. Letters which I 
have forwarded by Mr. St. Vrain, will inform you that we were overtaken, and surrounded by deep and impracticable snows in the Rocky Mountains at the head of the Del Norte. We lost 
all our animals and ten men, the mules frozen, and the men starved to death, Proue only excepted. He was frozen. The miscarriage of an express party, sent in under Mr. King, was a 
secondary cause of our greatest calamity in the loss of our men. In six days after leaving my camp in the mountains, I overtook his party, 
they having been out twenty-two days, and King having been starved to death. In four days afterwards I reached the settlements, in time to save many, but too late to rescue 
all the men. Relief was immediately sent back, but did not meet them in time to save all. An attempt, made with fresh animals, to get oar baggage out of the snow, failed entirely, 
resulting only in the loss of ten or twelve animals more. On the main river bottoms at the foot of the mountains, the snow was five feet deep and in the mountains impassable. Camp furniture 
of all descriptions, saddles, pack-saddles, etc., clothes, money, etc., all lost. I had the good fortune to recover one of my baggage trunks, 
which Jessie will remember to have packed for me, and so saved some clothes, etc. My instruments, which I always carry with me, were in greater part saved.

The officers of the army stationed in the country have been uniformly prompt and liberal in their attentions to me, offering me all the assistance in their power. In this country, 
where supplies are scarce and extravagantly high, this assistance was of great value to me in prosecuting my journey. Among those whom I ought particularly to mention is Major Beale, who is in command of the Northern District, Capt. Judd, Lt. Thomas, Dr. Webb, and Capt. Buford. I mention their names particularly, knowing that you will take pleasure in 
reciprocating it to them. Colonel Washington desired me to call on him without reserve for any thing at his command. He invited me to 
dine with him, one out of the two days I spent at Santa Fe, and dined with me at the officers' quarters on the other. Major Weightman (of Washington, son-in-law of Mr. Cox) was very friendly in his attentions to me, and Capt. Brent of the Quartermaster's deputy, gave me some 
most effective aid in my equipment. Among the citizens who have treated me with some 
attention, I make it a duty to recommend to your attention, when you may meet him, our fellow-citizen of St. Louis, Mr. F. X. Aubry. 
You will remember him as having lately made an extraordinary ride from Santa Fe to Independence. We have been travelling together from 
<a href='/results.php?city=santa fe' rel='city'>Santa Fe</a> to this place. Among other acts of kindness, I received from him a loan of $1000, to purchase animals for my journey to California. 
</p><p>
I reached this town at half-past 8 o'clock this morning, by appointment to breakfast. Capt. Buford, who commands here, received me with 
much kindness, and I am staying with him. This is a military post, and with the exception of a little village or two, a few miles below, the last settlement we see until reaching Tusson, 
even should we pass by that route. We go on this afternoon, and perhaps reach California in 
twenty-five days. The weather here is warm, and the people engaged in opening the ground for sowing. I will write a brief note to Jessie, 
and conclude this, as I shall be much pressed to get through the business set apart for this day.
</p><p>
Very affectionately,
