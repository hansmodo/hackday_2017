IN this beautiful month, when Nature wears her gayest garb, and animal and vegetable life is diffused on every side ; when the cheerful hand of industry is laying a foundation for a plentiful harvest, Who can forbear to rejoice in the season, or refrain 
from looking " through nature up to nature s God ; " 
</p><p>
".To feel the present Deity, and taste 
The joy of God, to see a happy world." 
</p><p>
While my heart expands, it, sighing, seeks its associate, and joins its first parent in that beautiful description of Milton.

" Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet, 
With charm of earliest birds ; pleasant the sun, 
When first on this delightful land he spreads 
His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, and flower, 
Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth 
After soft showers ; and sweet the coming on 
Of grateful Evening mild ; then silent Night 
With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon, 
And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train : 
But neither breath of morn when she ascends 
With charm of earliest birds ; nor rising sun 
On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower, 
Glistering with dew ; nor fragrance after showers ; 
Nor grateful Evening mild ; nor silent Night 
With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon, 
Or glittering starlight, without thee is sweet."

This passage has double charms for me, painted by the hand of truth ; and for the same reason, that 
a dear friend of mine, after having viewed a profusion of beautiful pictures, pronounced that which 
represented the parting of Hector and Andromache to be worth them all. The journal in which this is 
mentioned does not add any reason why it was so ; but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aba" rel="me">PORTIA</a> felt its full force, and paid a grateful tear to the acknowledgment.

We are anxiously waiting for intelligence from abroad. We shall have in the field a more respectable army, than has appeared there since the commencement of the war ; and all raised for three years or during the war, most of them men who have served before. The towns have exerted them 
selves upon this occasion with a spirit becoming patriots. We wish for a naval force, superior to 
what we have yet had, to act in concert with our army. We have been flattered from day to day, 
yet none has arrived. The enemy exults in the delay, and is improving the time to ravage Carolina and Virginia.

We hardly know what to expect from the United Provinces, because we are not fully informed of their 
disposition. Britain has struck a blow, by the capture of Eustatia, sufficient to arouse and unite them 
against her, if there still exists that spirit of liberty, which shone so conspicuous in their ancestors, and 
which, under much greater difficulties, led their hardy forefathers to reject the tyranny of Philip. I 
wish your powers may extend to an alliance with them, and that you may be as successful against the 
artifices of Britain, as a former ambassador was against those of another nation, when he negotiated 
a triple alliance in the course of five days, with an address which has ever done honor to his memory. 
If I was not so nearly connected, I should add, that there is no small similarity in the character of my 
friend and the gentleman, whose memoirs I have read with great pleasure.

Our State affairs I will write you, if the vessel does not sail till after election. Our friend, Mr. Cranch, goes from here representative, by a unanimous vote. Dr. Tufts, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>, is chosen senator. Our governor and lieutenant-governor, as at the beginning. Our poor old currency is breathing its last gasp. It received a most fatal wound from a collection of near the whole body s entering here from the southward ; having been informed, 
that it was treated here with more respect, and that it could purchase a solid and durable dress here for 
seventy-five paper dollars, but half the expense it must be at there, it travelled here with its whole train ; and, being much debauched in its manners communicated the contagion all of a sudden, and is universally rejected. It has given us a great shock.

Your ever affectionate
