Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
According to your orders I sit down to render this day a 
state of my account, which will be but short, because I shall 
charge at present no contingencies. There are some such 
which will come in my next account, and which would be stated this day, but as I have not yet got into the house which I 
hired immediately after my arrival, and which I have daily been 
in the hope of entering, my papers and books remain in the 
state in which they were. Add to this, that the amount is not 
great, and that I am very much occupied and very frequently 
interrupted. 
</p><p>
I left London on the last day of April; wherefore my salary to the last day of June being for two months was fifteen 
hundred dollars. My outfit is nine thousand, making, together, ten thousand five hundred dollars, for which I have drawn 
on the bankers of the United States at Amsterdam. 
</p><p>
I have boxed up the several newspapers to this day, and 
shall send them to Havre. My secretary's salary will now 
commence. I am, &ic.
