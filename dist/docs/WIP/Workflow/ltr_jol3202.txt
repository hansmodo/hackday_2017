SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing to your Excellency previous to the action of the 29th. My letter was committed to the care of Major Gibbs, and he destroyed 
it as soon as the engagement commenced, to guard 
against accidents. As your Excellency has already 
received minute accounts of the transactions of that 
day from those who saw them in a more collective 
view than the nature of my command afforded me. 
any further relation is rendered unnecessary. I shall 
confine myself, therefore, to congratulating your Excellency on the happy termination of an expedition, 
which at one period was threatened with the most 
tragical catastrophe. The advantages gained in the 
affair of Portsmouth, and the brilliant retreat which 
succeeded it, by doing honor to the American arms, 
consoled us in some degree for the loss of our grand 
object. 
</p><p>
The movements which your Excellency has observed at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the arrival of seventy sail of vessels 
in the road of <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>, the appearance of twenty 
sail off <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, are circumstances which keep us in 
suspense with respect to the enemy's intentions. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> has requested that I would remain in 
this quarter till they can be interpreted. In the mean 
time, he agrees with me, that if the enemy mean to 
act offensively here, a few days % preparation will be 
required. I have thought it incumbent on me. as 
part of the commission with which your Excellency 
honored me, to wait on <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>, and ask if 
he has any despatches for head-quarters. It will be 
my greatest happiness if I can be useful in explaining the causes of mutual jealousy and uneasiness 
which have existed between the officers of the allied 
powers here, and be any ways instrumental in restoring that harmony which the common interest re 
quires. 
</p><p>
I foretold, to the Marquis, the influence which the 
Count's departure from the road of <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a> would 
probably have upon the minds of the people, and the 
danger of its reviving those absurd prejudices which 
we inherited from the British nation. Unhappily the 
mischief has become more extensive by the unguarded expressions of some men of rank, who listened to 
their chagrin rather than good policy. Reflection, 
however, begins to induce a more cautious behaviour, 
and I am in hopes that the confidence of the people 
in our new allies will be restored. 
</p><p>
The Count's sensibility was much wounded by the 
manner in which the protest was delivered to him. 
In a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> he declares, that this 
paper imposed on the Commander of the King's 
squadron the painful but necessary law of profound 
silence ; that he had taken occasion, however, relatively to some other business, to acquaint him, that, if 
the Council of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> accepted his offer (which was 
to repair to Rhode Island at the head of his land 
troops, and receive <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>'s orders), he 
would promise the most implicit obedience on the 
part of his troops, and set them the example of it ; 
that the extreme sensibility, which composed the 
French national character, in every thing that relates 
to their honor, required that the French Commander-in-chief should, by his sentiments for the American 
General, and by a conspicuous measure, announce that 
French delicacy could not be wounded in a moment 
of passion, which arose from disappointment, felt alike 
by both parties. In a postscript he requested that 
the Marquis de la Fayette may explain matters between them. The expressions of the Count's letter 
are rather obscure; but, by discovering an inclination 
to make great personal sacrifices, it is, in my opinion,a foundation for restoring harmony and a good understanding. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>'s answer, I hope, will 
improve it. I have the honor to be, with the greatest attachment and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
