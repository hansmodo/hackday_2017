Sir, 
</p><p>
I am still so unhappy, as to be without the honor of any reply to the several letters I have written through you to 
Congress, praying that honorable body to favor me with an audience, and that they would give the necessary orders to 
their ministers or commissioners at the Court of Versailles to examine, adjust, and settle my accounts immediately on 
my return to France. I take the liberty now to add to what I have already written, that the hopes of being favored 
with an audience have already occasioned my losing several very agreeable and safe opportunities of returning, until the 
season has become as pressing as the business which calls me back, and obliges me most earnestly to entreat the attention of Congress to my situation and requests. 
I have the honor to remain, etc.
