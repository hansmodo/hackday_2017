UNITED STATES FRIGATE CONGRESS, 
BAY OF <a href='/results.php?city=monterey' rel='city origin'>MONTEREY</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="9">September</a> <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1846' rel="origin">1846</a>.

SIR : I am informed by express from <a href='/results.php?tla=jbm' rel='co-worker'>Commander Montgomery</a>, at San Francisco, that Suter's Fort, on the Sacramento, is threatened by a thousand Indians from the Oregon, of the Walla-Walla tribe. 
</p><p>
The cause of their hostility appears to be this : about a year since one of their chiefs was deliberately murdered at Suter's Fort by a man named Cook. 
</p><p>
The Erie is under way, and I have only time to say that I shall go after them immediately with the crews of this ship and the Savannah, and I will give them 
satisfaction or a fight. Will you please to send to me, by Mr. Norris, a good spy-glass? 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R F. STOCKTON, Commodore, &c. 
</p><p>
To the Hon. George Bancroft, 
</p><p>
Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C.
