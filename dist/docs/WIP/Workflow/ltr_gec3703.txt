Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although you were pleased, on your leaving the 
State, to express a desire of hearing from me, I 
could not think myself justifiable in troubling your 
Excellency with a line during the campaign, when I 
was sensible every moment of your time must have 
been occupied in matters of the greatest moment, and 
more especially as my letters, in point of information, 
could have been little more than a repetition of what 
I was persuaded you must receive from the Commanding Officer of the department, whose attention, I 
was convinced, would lead him to make the earliest 
communications. 1 flatter myself that my silence will 
not be imputed to want of respect, and that your 
Excellency will believe, that no one was more anxiously concerned for your personal safety, and the success of your operations, than I was, or enjoys with 
greater pleasure the event so distinguishably honorable to the allied arms.

Induced by the situation of a number of the citizens of this State, who had been captured on the 
frontiers by ravaging parties of the enemy, and carried into Canada, I last spring addressed a line to 
Governor Haldiman, on the subject of their liberation. 
I have lately been favored with his answer; and as 
in it he has taken occasion to introduce his objection 
to the exchange of prisoners taken in arms, I conceive it my duty to transmit to your Excellency copies of this correspondence, which you will find inclosed, in hopes, while in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, your Excellency may be able to have such measures adopted as 
will obviate the difficulties which stand in the way 
of the exchange of our friends in that quarter, many 
of whom have already suffered a long and rigorous 
confinement. 
</p><p>
I lately transmitted to Congress two affidavits, proving a traitorous correspondence between the leaders 
on the New Hampshire Grants, and the enemy ; and 
one of them, that an actual league of amity was settled between them ; which, I presume, have been communicated to your Excellency. There are many other 
circumstances tending to establish the facts contained 
in those affidavits, which would be too tedious to relate. The well-affected in this State, and I believe I 
may venture to say in some of the neighbouring 
States, begin to be exceedingly alarmed at their conduct. Add to this, the violent and oppressive measures pursued by them against some of the most respectable citizens, to support their late extension of 
jurisdiction, will, I am persuaded, before the opening 
of spring, occasion our having recourse to arms to oppose their usurpations. I have the honor to be, with 
the highest respect and esteem. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
