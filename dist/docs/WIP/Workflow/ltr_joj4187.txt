Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your letter of the 22d ult., and for 
the papers which you was so good as to send; they 
arrived by the last mail. 
</p><p>
It is to be regretted, that passions unfavourable to mutual 
good-will have for years been industriously and unwisely 
excited both in Great Britain and America. An inveterate 
delusion has long prevailed in our country ; <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
has made it a scourge for our chastisement, and we well 
deserve it. 
</p><p>
Every independent nation has, as such, a rightful and 
exclusive jurisdiction over the country within its acknowledged boundary lines. For either nation to propose to the 
other a system of measures for the security and comfort of 
the Indians, dwelling within their contiguous and respective 
territories, or for other mutual good purposes, can neither 
be offensive nor improper ; but to dictate such propositions, 
and to tell us that we must accede to them as the price of 
peace/Ms to assume language rarely used, unless by the 
victorious to the vanquished. 
</p><p>
It is not clear to me, that Britain did then expect or 
desire to conclude the war quite so soon. As to her present or future disposition to peace, or how far it has been or 
may be affected by a settled or by a still fluctuating state 
of things in Europe, or by calculations of our becoming 
more united or more divided, cannot now be known. If 
we should change our rulers, and fill their places with men 
free from blame, the restoration of peace might doubtless 
be more easily accomplished. Such a change will come, 
but not while the prevailing popular delusion continues to 
deceive and mislead so great a portion of our citizens. 
</p><p>
Things being as they are, I think we cannot be too perfectly united in a determination to defend our country ; 
nor be too vigilant in watching and resolutely examining 
the conduct of the administration in all its departments, 
candidly and openly giving decided approbation or decided 
censure, according as it may deserve the one or the other. 
Report says, that in the public expenditures there has been 
great culpability. It is desirable, therefore, that they be 
thoroughly investigated, and that the results be authenticated in such a manner as to obviate doubt and disbelief. 
</p><p>
I have just read <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>'s speech. They who complain that it exhibits too little of the " suaviter in modo" 
cannot also complain that it exhibits too little of the " fortiter in re." 
</p><p>
With constant esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
Jon* Jay.
