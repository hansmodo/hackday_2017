Tuesday evening 
</p><p>
My dear Gen'l , 
</p><p>
. . . The Senate immediately agreed to the amendment so that the Bill has finally passed. x I congratulate 
our friends most cordially upon their most satisfactory result. 
Now for the President. My belief is that the President will veto the bill though that is not generally known or believed. 
This however we shall soon see.
