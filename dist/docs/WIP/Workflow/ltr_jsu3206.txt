DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
As your Excellency has honored me with an 
appointment to command the intended expedition - I 
must beg leave to lay my sentiments before you in 
writing ; as words used in conversation may vanish 
in air, and the remembrance of them be lost, while 
writing will remain, either to justify my opinion, 
or to prove that it was erroneous. The variety of 
reasons, which I urged yesterday, for passing with 
the main body up the Mohawk River, and down by 
Wood Creek to the Cayuga Lake, still have their 
weight in my mind ; but, as <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> writes 
that they cannot be supplied with provisions, the 
plan must be given up, and that of passing with 
the main body up the Susquehanna adopted. 
</p><p>
The force which I have requested for that quarter, is three thousand effective men, after all proper 
deductions are made for guards at the several posts, 
for boatmen, hospital guards, tenders, &c. &c. That 
these should be collected before we enter the Indian 
country, appears to me essentially necessary, as it 
is supposed that the principal opposition we shall 
meet will be between Wyoming and Tioga. Should 
this be the case, as seemed to be the general opinion in Council yesterday, we can derive no advantage from the party on the Mohawk River, as they 
are not to join us until we have established a post 
at Tioga. Should they attempt to join us before, 
they must be defeated in passing down the Susquehanna ; and, should our numbers be such as to 
admit of a defeat before we arrive at Tioga, as we 
can have no communication with the other party, 
and they are to regulate themselves by a plan fixed 
before we march, they will remain ignorant of our defeat, and of course proceed at the time appointed, 
and in all probability fall into the hands of the 
enemy. If we are to expect the principal opposition 
before we arrive at Tioga, it is absurd to reckon, 
for part of our force, troops who are not to attempt 
joining us before we have passed the principal danger. 
</p><p>
Indeed, I have no great dependence upon the 
advantages to be derived from so small a party in 
that quarter. It was yesterday said, that we might 
expect fourteen hundred Indians to oppose us in our march. Your Excellency will permit me to say, that 
fourteen hundred Indians, perfectly acquainted with 
the country, capable of seizing every advantage which 
the ground can possibly afford, perfectly acquainted 
with the use of arms, inured to war from their youth, 
and, from their manner of living, capable of enduring every kind of fatigue, are no despicable enemy, 
when opposed to three thousand troops, totally unacquainted with the country and the Indian manner of 
fighting, and who, though excellent in the field, are 
far from having that exactness with fire-arms or that 
alertness in a wooded country, which Indians have. 
As so many facts have contributed to prove this, it 
will be unnecessary for me to say more upon the 
subject. If I was not a party concerned in this expedition, and my opinion was asked of the force necessary to insure success, I should give it, that the 
force of each party should be equal to the highest estimate of the enemy's force in that country, that 
they might be able to form a junction at all events, 
and put the matter beyond possibility of doubt; and, 
after that, they would be enabled to detach and conquer the country in an eighth part of the time that 
they would, if obliged, for their own safety, to keep 
in a body. I know that the estimated force of the 
Indians is small ; but, when I consider that under 
rating the number of the enemy has been a prevailing error with us since the commencement of the 
war, that we have had persons from among them, both 
inhabitants and deserters, and have had the proceedings, debates, and calculations of Parliament before us, 
and yet have frequently mistaken their number more 
than one half, I cannot suppose but that we are still 
liable to fall into the same error, where we can have 
no evidence, and every thing told us respecting them 
is a mere matter of opinion. In addition to this, let 
me repeat what I observed yesterday, which is the 
probability of a force being sent from Canada by 
way of Lake Ontario. I also beg leave to observe 
that, when our advancement upon the Susquehanna is 
known, it will probably be conjectured that our intention is against Niagara, which will induce the 
enemy strongly to reenforce that post. This they 
may do in a fortnight, as it is but one hundred and 
ten miles from Montreal to Oswegachie, and their 
vessels can take troops from thence to Niagara in 
three or four days; and, when they find that our intention is against the Indian settlements, those troops 
will undoubtedly join them. From these considerations it must appear that the demand I have madeis far from being unreasonable, even exclusive of 
the party sent on their flanks. I well know that 
Continental troops cannot be spared for this purpose, 
but good militia should undoubtedly be called for. 
The expedition is undertaken to destroy those Indian 
nations, and to convince others that we have the 
power to carry the war into their country, whenever 
they commence hostilities. Should we fail in the at 
tempt, the Indians will derive confidence from it, and 
grow more insolent than before. 
</p><p>
I beg leave further to mention, that, in my opinion, the troops selected for this expedition are by no 
means equal to those they must expect to encounter ; 
especially the Pennsylvania troops, as they are principally made up of old countrymen, who are totally 
unacquainted with that kind of fighting, which they 
must adopt. I have conversed with <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> 
upon this head, who is fully of my opinion. The 
best troops, in my opinion, for this expedition, are 
General Poor's brigade, who are all marksmen, and 
accustomed to the Indian mode of fighting. I think 
the Jersey troops good ; the York troops I know nothing of; the other broken corps I can say nothing 
about., only that, when they come to act in a body 
with others, much cannot be expected from them. 
</p><p>
Thus have I submitted my sentiments to your Excellency, and trust that my reasoning upon the subject must prove, that three thousand good and effective men, at least, will be necessary to march from 
Tioga, exclusive of those which your Excellency may 
think proper to direct to operate on the other flank 
of the enemy. I have the honor to be, with the 
most lively sentiments of esteem and respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. Since writing the above, I have shown it to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>, who says that his sentiments correspond with mine in every particular. J. S.
