Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . With a view to secure the best talents in its service &amp; to reward the meritorious officers, the rule of the Bank 
is that whenever any vacancy occurs it is rilled by promotion, &amp; the person last introduced takes his place at the foot 
of the list, &amp; is gradually advanced if found deserving. The 
salary of the Officers on their first entrance into the Bank is 
seven hundred dollars ($700) a year. A comparatively small 
compensation, but as it is known to lead to more lucrative 
situations, it is sufficient to attract to the service of the Bank 
a great number of applicants of respectability. When a vacancy takes place a selection is made from these by a ballot 
at the Board in which I of course participate as one of the 
members merely. At present there is no vacancy. It is impossible however to say how soon there may be one and if you 
think it desirable after what I have stated to come into the Bank I would recommend this course. . . .
