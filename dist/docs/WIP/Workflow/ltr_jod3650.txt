MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR letters of November 29, December 2 and 3, 
affect me very tenderly. The low spirits, effects of 
long and exhausting sickness are apparent ; but these are evils of a serious nature. I pray you to banish 
as much as possible all gloomy thoughts, and be very cautious to avoid every thing which may endanger a return of your old disorders. 
</p><p>
To reconcile you to your fate, I have a great mind 
to give you a detail of mine. A peck of troubles iu 
a large bundle of papers, often in a hand-writing 
almost illegible, comes every day from the office of 
</p><p>
, office of , office of , &c., &c., &c. 
</p><p>
Thousands of sea letters, Mediterranean passes, and 
commissions and patents to sign; no company no 
society idle, unmeaning ceremony, follies, extravagance, shiftlessness, and health sinking, for what I 
know, under my troubles and fatigues. You and I 
seem to have arrived prematurely at the age when 
there is no pleasure. 
</p><p>
All this is not the resignation of Socrates. 
</p><p>
I cannot encourage the idea of your coming on to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. The horrid roads, and cold, damp 
weather, would put an end to you. I hope our dear 
son will arrive and cheer you up. 
</p><p>
I am, with unalterable affection,
