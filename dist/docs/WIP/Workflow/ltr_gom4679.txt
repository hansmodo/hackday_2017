My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will see by the official correspondence, that your orders are complied with, and that your intentions are fulfilled. 
Permit me on this occasion to remark, that had the people of 
America been well informed of the state of things on this side 
of the Atlantic, no one would have dared to adopt the conduct 
which M. Genet has pursued. In reading the few gazettes 
which have reached me, I am surprised to see so little sound 
intelligence.

The present government is evidently a despotism both in 
principle and practice. The Convention now consists of only a part of those, who were chosen to frame a constitution. 
These, after putting under arrest their fellows, claim all power, 
and have delegated the greater part of it to a Committee of 
Safety. You will observe, that one of the ordinary measures 
of government is to send out Commissioners with unlimited 
authority. They are invested with power to remove officers 
chosen by the people, and put others in their places. This 
power, as well as that of imprisoning on suspicion, is liberally 
exercised. The revolutionary tribunal established here to 
judge on general principles, gives unbounded scope to will. 
It is an emphatical phrase in fashion among the patriots, that 
terror is the order of the day. Some years have elapsed since 
Montesquieu wrote, that the principle of arbitrary governments is fear.

The Queen was executed the day before yesterday. In 
sulted during her trial, and reviled in her last moments, she 
behaved with dignity throughout. This execution will, I 
think, give to future hostilities a deeper dye, and unite more 
intimately the allied powers. It will silence the opposition of 
those, who would not listen to the dismemberment of this 
country, and, therefore it may be concluded that the blow by 
which she died was directed from a distance. 
But whatever may be the lot of France in remote futurity, 
and putting aside the military events, it seems evident that she 
must soon be governed by a single despot. Whether she will 
pass to that point through the medium of a triumvirate, or 
other small body of men, seems as yet undetermined. I think 
it most probable that she will. A great and awful crisis seems 
to be near at hand. A blow is, I am told, meditated which 
will shroud in grief and horror a guilty land. Already the 
prisons are surcharged with persons, who consider themselves 
victims. Nature recoils, and I yet hope that these ideas are 
circulated only to inspire fear. I am, &c.
