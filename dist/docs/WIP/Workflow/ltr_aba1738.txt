T'is a little more than three weeks since the dearest of friends and tenderest of husbands left l his solitary 
partner, and quitted all the fond endearments of domestic felicity for the dangers of the sea, exposed, 
perhaps, to the attack of a hostile foe, and, O good Heaven ! can I add, to the dark assassin, to the secret 
murderer, and the bloody emissary of as cruel a tyrant as God, in his righteous judgments, ever suffered to disgrace the throne of Britain.

I have travelled with you over the wide Atlantic, and could have landed you safe, with humble confidence, at your desired haven, and then have set myself down to enjoy a negative kind of happiness, in the painful part which it has pleased Heaven to 
allot me ; but the intelligence with regard to that great philosopher, able statesman, and unshaken 
friend of his country, has planted a dagger in my breast, and I feel, with a double edge, the weapon that pierced the bosom of a Franklin.

" For nought avail the virtues of the heart, 
Nor towering genius claims its due reward ; 
</p><p>
From Britain s fury, as from death s keen dart, No worth can save us, and no fame can guard."

The more distinguished the person, the greater the inveteracy of these foes of human nature. The 
argument of my friends to alleviate my anxiety, by persuading me that this shocking attempt will put 
you more upon your guard and render your person more secure than if it had never taken place, is kind 
in them, and has some weight ; but my greatest comfort and consolation arise from the belief of a superintending Providence to whom I can, with confidence, commit you, since not a sparrow falls to the ground without his notice. Were it not for this, I should be miserable and overwhelmed by my fears and apprehensions.

Freedom of sentiment, the life and soul of friend ship, is in a great measure cut off by the danger of 
miscarriage, and the apprehension of letters falling into the hands of our enemies. Should this meet with that fate, may they blush for their connexion 
with a nation who have rendered themselves infamous and abhorred, by a long list of crimes, which 
not their high achievements, nor the lustre of former deeds, nor the tender appellation of parent, nor the 
fond connexion which once subsisted, can ever blot from our remembrance, nor wipe out those indelible 
stains of their cruelty and baseness. They have engraven them with a pen of iron on a rock for ever.

To my dear son remember me in the most affectionate terms. I would have written to him, but my 
notice is so short that I have not time. Enjoin it upon him never to disgrace his mother, and to be 
have worthily of his father. Tender as maternal affection is, it was swallowed up in what I found a 
stronger, or so intermixed that I felt it not in its full force till after he had left me. I console myself with 
the hopes of his reaping advantages under the careful eye of a tender parent, which it was not in my 
power to bestow upon him.

There has nothing material taken place in the political world since you left us. This letter will go by 
a vessel for Bilboa, from whence you may, perhaps, get better opportunities of conveyance than from any 
other place. The letter you delivered to the pilot came safe to hand. All the little folks are anxious 
for the safety of their papa and brother, to whom they desire to be remembered ; to which is added the 
tenderest sentiments of affection, and the fervent prayers for your happiness and safety, of your
