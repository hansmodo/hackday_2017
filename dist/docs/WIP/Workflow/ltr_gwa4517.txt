Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have in confidence imparted to you the alteration of our late plan, and made you acquainted with our intended operations. Besides the provision necessary at 
the Head of Elk to carry the troops down the bay, a very considerable quantity will be wanted in Virginia. I should suppose three hundred barrels of flour, as 
many of salt meat, and eight or ten hogsheads of rum would be sufficient at Elk. For what will be consumed in Virginia, I imagine the order must be general, as we can neither ascertain the number of men, 
who will he drawn together, or the time they will be employed. 
</p><p>
I have written to the Count de Grasse, and have requested him to send up his light vessels of every kind to Elk ; but I would  nevertheless wish to have all that 
may be at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> and the upper parts of the bay 
secured. I shall therefore be obliged to you to take measures at a proper time for that purpose. When that time will be, and when you shall give orders for 
the deposit at Elk, I will hereafter inform you. I shall direct the quartermaster in due season to take up all the small craft in the Delaware for the purpose of 
transporting the troops from <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> to Christiana. Should he have occasion for advice or assistance from you upon this occasion, I must request you to give 
him both. I am confident it will be necessary to give the American troops, destined for southern services, one month's pay in specie. This will amount to about 
dollars. If it will be possible for you to procure this sum, you will infinitely oblige me and will much benefit the service. I shall also stand in need of a sum of specie for secret services, I suppose about 
five hundred guineas. I am, dear Sir, &c.
