I snatch a minute to congratulate my dear father, 
upon the important intelligence from France. As the 
matter is represented she seems to have acted with 
politic generosity towards us, and to have timed her 
declaration in our favour most admirably for her own 
interests, and the abasement of her ancient rival. If 
the general languor can be shaken off, and that this 
</p><p>
event instead of increasing our supineness stimulates 
us to vigorous exertions, we may close the war with 
great eclat, provided General Howe does not receive 
timely orders to collect his force and secure a retreat. 
France might give a mortal blow to the English naval 
force in its present scattered state. 
</p><p>
I have just received your kind favour of the 28th ult. I have reason to hope that opportunities for 
writing to my wife will he more frequent and certain, 
and that we may soon find a proper conveyance for 
herself. 
</p><p>
With respect to the report of the committee, I think 
a more spirited answer was required to the arrogance 
and insolence of the British minister in offering us 
pardons, and a part of our rights. I am entirely of 
your opinion on the subject of the proposed addition 
to the resolutions.

The only reason that can be assigned for Col. Hartley's delay, is that there are better quarters at 
York than at <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a>. The General probably is 
ignorant that he has received his order to march from 
Congress. 
</p><p>
General McIntosh desires me to send you the 
inclosed paper, with his compliments. 
</p><p>
Your letter to Bringhurst went some time since. 
I received an answer from him a day or two ago, that 
the body of your carriage is at the painter's in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and that if I give him a pass for a gentleman 
who wants to get a carriage in, that gentleman will 
undertake to get a pass for yours to come out. I must 
inquire who the gentleman is, and if the matter can 
be transacted with propriety it shall be done. He 
promises to finish the carriage out of hand, if this 
arrangement can be made. 
</p><p>
I am hurried to close my letter, and must bid adieu 
to my dear father.
