Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your favor of the 10th, announcing your resignation of the chair of Congress 
and the election of Mr. McKean to that important station. I flattered myself with the hope of an opportunity of personally acknowledging the attentions, which 
I received from you during your presidency ; but as I 
find you could not with convenience make a visit to 
the army on your way home, I am constrained to 
take this method of returning my thanks and expressing my sincere wishes for the re-establishment of your 
health. I am exceedingly happy to hear, that our political affairs begin to assume a new and pleasing appearance, which, if continued, will I hope have an influence upon the military. That department is yet 
laboring under every difficulty and distress, and there 
seems to me little chance of its being relieved from 
the debility to which it is reduced ; for, notwithstanding my pressing requisitions, and the more pressing 
occasion which there is for recruits at this moment, I 
may almost say I have not received one man since 
my last demand. 
</p><p>
The station, which you have lately filled -with so 
much honor, has given you an opportunity of making 
yourself intimately acquainted with our real situation ; 
and a representation from you to your State will naturally have more weight, than that of a stranger to public affairs. Be assured. Sir, you cannot employ your 
time better at home, than in constantly impressing all 
ranks with the necessity of recruiting and supplying 
the army. I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p>
