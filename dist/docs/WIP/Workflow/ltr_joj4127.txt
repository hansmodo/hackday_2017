My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My task is done ; whether finis coronat opus, the president, senate, and public will decide. 
</p><p>
This letter goes by the packet, and the treaty with it ; 
some parts of it require elucidation to common readers. I 
have not time for comments ; <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> is anxious to 
dismiss the packet ; I therefore write in haste. If this treaty 
fails, I despair of another. If satisfactory, care should be 
taken that the public opinion be not misled respecting it, for 
this reason the sooner it is ratified and published the better. 
I really think the good disposition of this country should be 
cherished. I came here in the moment of exultation and 
triumph on account of Lord Howe's victory. From that 
day to this I have experienced no change in sentiments or 
conduct relative to the negotiation. I must, though not 
without reluctance, conclude; not being fit for a winter 
voyage, I shall stay here till spring. Indeed, I shall want 
repairs before I am quite fit for any voyage. God bless you.

Yours,
