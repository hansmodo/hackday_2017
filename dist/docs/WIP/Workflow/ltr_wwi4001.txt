My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Though so many years have passed since we saw or 
heard from each other, I hope I do not deceive myself 
when I presume that we continue to retain each other in 
friendly remembrance, not without taking a real interest in 
each other's well being. Such, at least, I can truly declare, 
are my own sentiments and feelings in relation to you; and 
embracing every opportunity of inquiring after you, I 
heard with sincere pleasure, the other day, from an American acquaintance, that you were living in health and comfort, though retired from public life. But why do I say, 
though retired, when I can most sincerely aver, that with a 
view to health and comfort, and those of mind as well as 
of body, no situation in life has ever presented itself to my 
imagination under so hopeful a form as that which my 
favourite poet describes as " domestic life in rural leisure passed" I forget whether you are a lover of poetry ; if 
you were so when you were young, I think that even in 
advanced life the author of the above line, Cowper, will 
still be dear to you. His piety gives unfading charms to 
his compositions. But I am in danger of expending all the 
time for which I must venture to detain you, without proceeding to the business which gives me occasion, an occasion 
which, I own, I am glad to seize, to address you after so 
long a silence. I am aware, indeed, that your retirement 
may prevent your taking any part in public, even in the 
case I am about to mention ; still your opinion, your good 
wishes may be useful to us. Since the abolition of the 
slave-trade, an institution has been formed consisting of a 
considerable number of the most respectable members of 
both houses of parliament, as well as of other men of consideration and worth, with the Duke of Gloucester at our 
head, for the purpose of promoting civilization and improvement in Africa. Of course, all our hopes are 
grounded and bottomed in the cessation of the slave-trade. 
Now, from the operation of the war, and of other causes, 
this traffic is stopped, with a very trilling exception, which 
though trifling, we are trying, and that successfully, to do 
away throughout all that immense part of the continent of 
Africa which is north of the line, and indeed much further ; 
unless as it may be carried on by your countrymen and 
our own, in direct violation of the laws of both countries. 
We trust we shall be able, by sending ships of war to 
scour the coast of Africa, to suppress the British slave trade ; but this will be of little avail, if the traffic may still 
be carried on in fact, though prohibited by law, by the 
American slave-trader ; nor do I see any prospect of preventing this abuse, unless a convention could be made 
between the two countries, by which the ships of war of 
each should be authorized and even encouraged (by the 
hopes of gaining by the forfeitures) to seize and bring in 
for adjudication the vessels of the other, when prosecuting 
this unlawful commerce. I rather believe there is another 
particular in which it still remains for your country to render its law similar to ours, by subjecting to forfeiture any 
ship of any country, and under any flag, which is fitted out 
in and cleared out from an American port. Now, my 
dear sir, may I hope for your assistance towards the production of the effects I have specified ? Knowing to whom 
I am writing, I will say no more on this head. 
</p><p>
I cannot address you without tracing my way to the 
period when we were last together, through the long and 
interesting interval which lies between that and the present 
moment. What events have since happened ! What 
events may take place in the same number of years yet to 
come ! How many whom we loved have gone in the last thirteen years ! How many will go in the next ! How 
strongly, my dear sir, are we' admonished to place our 
happiness on a firmer and more secure basis, than it can 
enjoy in this world, which never more than of late verified 
the character given of it by one of our greatest and best 
churchmen, Hooker, that it is full (made up, I think he 
says) of perturbations. How astonishing is it to see men 
of penetrating understandings, and of deep and large 
views, confining their regards to this limited scene, apparently insensible to the existence of any thing beyond it ! 
But I beg pardon for thus running on, and I stop before my 
pen has got the mastery of me. I will detain you no 
longer than while I express my hopes that you are well 
and happy, and assure you that I shall never cease to take 
an interest in your welfare. 
</p><p>
I remain, with respect and regard, 
</p><p>
My dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and faithful servant,

P. S. If you favour me with a reply, may I take the liberty of asking after your family 1 I married about two 
years after you left England, and am surrounded, I thank God, by an excellent wife and children. I trust I do not 
deceive myself in the persuasion that you will not be uninterested in this statement, for which therefore I will not 
use the affectation of apologizing. I will take the liberty of sending you a copy of the African Institution's reports. 
You will also see in it a list of the members.
