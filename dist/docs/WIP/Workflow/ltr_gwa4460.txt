Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of this date has not a little embarrassed me. You must remember the ferment in the Pennsylvania line the last campaign, occasioned by the appointment of Major Macpherson, and you know the 
uneasiness that at this moment exists among the eastern troops on account of the commands conferred upon Colonel Gimat and Major Galvan, although it was the result of absolute necessity. 
</p><p>
Should circumstances admit of the formation of another advanced corps, of which I see very little prospect from present appearances, it can be but small, 
and must be composed almost entirely of eastern troops ; and to add to the discontents of the officers 
of those lines by the further appointment of an officer of your rank to (lie comiuaiKl of it, or in it, would, I 
and certain, involve nie in a difficulty of a very disagrecat)Io and delicate nature, and niiujht perhaps lead 
to conseciuences more serious than it is easy to imagine. Wiiile I adhere firmly to the right of making 
such appointments as you request, I am at the same time obliged to reflect, that it will not do to push that right too far, more especially in a service like ours, and at a time so critical as the present. 
</p><p>
I am convinced, that no officer can with justice dispute your merit and abilities. The opposition heretofore made has not been for the want of those qualifications in the gentlemen, who are and have been the 
objects of discontent. The officers of the line contend, without having reference to particular persons, 
that it is a hardship and reflection upon them to introduce brevet officers into commands, of some permanence, in which there are more opportunities of 
distinguishing themselves, than in the line of the army 
at large, and with the men they have had the trouble 
to discipline and prepare for the field. 
</p><p>
My principal concern arises from an apprehension, 
that you will impute my refusal of your request to 
other motives, than those I have expressed ; but I beg 
you to be assured I am only influenced by the reasons, which I have mentioned. I am, dear Sir, &,c.
