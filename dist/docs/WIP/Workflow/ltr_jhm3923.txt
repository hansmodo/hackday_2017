SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter, received yesterday, relieved me from a great deal of uneasiness, as Mr. K. Simons came down two days before and informed me that 
he was apprehensive, from the accounts he had heard, that your brigade had been defeated, a total route ensued, and that they had suffered 
severely. Under these impressions, you may judge what must have been my feelings on receipt of your letter yesterday. I most sincerely 
congratulate you, sir, on your triumph over the deep laid scheme of our inveterate enemies. Their disappointment, in a plan they had 
depended so much upon, must chagrin them far more than their loss. Your account of the behavior of the militia reflects great honor on them, and exhibits an example worthy of imitation by the rest of their 
brethren. With respect to the prize you mention, 1 would have you by all means carry the proclamation into force against her in the most 
rigid manner also, with regard to any others that might be taken ; for, notwithstanding every exertion, the Charlestown markets are amply 
supplied with all kinds of provisions, by a parcel of mercenary, infamous wretches, who make lucre their only object, no matter how diabolical 
the means they pursue to obtain it, or how prejudicial it may be to the interest of their country. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
