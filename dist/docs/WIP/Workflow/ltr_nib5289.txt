My dear Sir

Altho we do not feel anxious as to the result of the movements at Washington touching the Bank, still it is 
thought prudent to prepare for any adverse event and accordingly we have this day given instructions to the Branches 
to keep their discounts at their present amount and to shorten the time for which they buy bills of exchange. This 
will make the institution strong &amp; if any sudden movement is attempted by the Cabinet, proper or improper, we shall 
be ready. This will, I trust be temporary, as the squall may blow over.
