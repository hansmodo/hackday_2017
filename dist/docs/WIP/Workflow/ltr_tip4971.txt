... Colonel Harrison yesterday went to Reading to see 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker met'>General Mifflin</a>, being in some doubt whether to accept or 
not. I hope ardently that he will, because he is a sensible, 
a diligent, a most worthy, honest man, with whom I live in 
the greatest harmony, and whose inclinations correspond 
with mine. ... I am aware of the vast importance of 
the office ; and when the intention of Congress to appoint 
Colonel Harrison (the General's [Washington s] first Secretary) and me was first intimated to the General, I was 
surprised, deeming the office above my abilities and knowledge. But the General thought the Congress made a discreet choice, observing (to Mr. Harrison) that those who 
had been in the army could best judge of its wants, and, 
having felt them, would of course most probably provide 
suitable supplies, so far as the means were in their power. 
I suppose the General's approbation was sent to Congress ; 
for, in a few days after, the appointments were made. I 
wondered a little the General should be so ready to part 
with Colonel Harrison, because he was his acquaintance 
before the war, had been with him two years as Secretary, 
very diligent in business, and high in his estimation. 
Nothing but the greater public good could have induced 
him to part with Colonel Harrison. 
With regard to myself, I think I can do as much public 
service in this new office as in that I now hold ; and, at 
the same time, it will be attended with circumstances much 
more agreeable to me. My present business has been one 
continued course of attention and unremitting toil ; for, of 
the five months I have been in the service, during one only 
have I had any assistance. I could have none while remaining in the General's family, because my deputy could not 
also be admitted. The General's family is large, and I 
cannot wonder that he was unwilling to increase it. I only 
wish he had sooner explained his mind. On the 1st of 
September I got a deputy [Lieutenant-Colonel Smith] , and 
then first found that he could not make one of the family. 
This put me in a situation quite disagreeable, and I did not 
expect the deputy would have consented to serve ; but he 
did ; and, to render his situation as tolerable as possible, I 
went to board with him while at Wilmington, for I had 
quarters at a house close by head-quarters ; but this lasted 
only a week, when the army marched. In two or three 
days, the General, observing my absence from table, sent 
one of his aids to tell me that he feared I had mistaken him, 
and that, although he could not admit of an addition to his 
family by my deputy, yet he always wished me to make 
one of it. I told the aide-de-camp (who was my intimate 
friend) I had not mistaken him ; but, as it was inconvenient 
to the General to admit my deputy at the same time, the, 
situation of the latter must be so disagreeable that I could 
not think of separating from him in such manner. -After 
quitting Wilmington, we were so continually shifting ground, 
and in places where houses were thinly scattered round, there 
was no possibility of my deputy's being elsewhere than at 
head-quarters ; but I know his feelings were much hurt by it. 
</p><p>
On the 4th of October, Lieutenant-Colonel Smith was 
wounded, and from that time I have been without help. 
Many wondered I did not get another deputy, or assistant ; 
but, when I told them the reason, they ceased to wonder, and 
confessed the case difficult. But I will not tire you further 
with this detail. Had I remained any longer in the office 
of Adjutant-General, I would, upon our next move, and 
always afterwards, have taken separate quarters, and got a 
deputy. This would have been sometimes very inconvenient, because I came away, you know, altogether unprepared 
to keep a table of my own : however, I should have been 
able to do my business with a vast deal more ease and 
satisfaction, though I must have lived at much greater 
expense. . . . 
</p><p>
My new appointment I revolved in my mind deliberately ; a variety of motives conspired to lead me to accept 
it; and, after concluding that I could serve the public at 
least to as much advantage as in my present office, every 
personal consideration was strongly in favor of my accepting it. A more laborious office, I was sure, I could not 
have ; and the hurry, noise, and bustle of a camp are less 
compatible with one's ease than the quiet and regular 
periods of labor and rest to be enjoyed in the country in 
my new employment. . . . 
</p><p>
... When my friends read this letter, they may wonder 
at the facility with which I contemplate a separation from 
them. Much pleasure, indeed, have I enjoyed in their society, and still wish to enjoy. Nowhere can I expect to find an 
equal kindness and affection. But these considerations yield 
to capital advantages to one's family; and every married 
man knows that a wife and children are more than parents, 
brothers, sisters, and other relatives combined. Besides, 
the business of my department may probably carry me in 
the way of seeing them at least once a year, which is as 
frequently as they see some other branches of the family not 
fifty miles distant ; and I am sure they would hear from me 
as often as they do from them, and oftener. 
</p><p>
I expect, the latter end of this week or the beginning of 
next, to set off for Yorktown, where Congress sits. Millet
will go with me. I gave him full expectation of my serving, 
during the war, in the military line, and that he should be 
with me. He enlisted on that footing only. Were I to 
leave him in the service, I should disappoint and deceive 
him, and render him very unhappy. I shall therefore pro 
cure his discharge, which I think the General will grant 
without difficulty. The bounties Millet has received from 
the State of Massachusetts Bay and from the town I shall 
be ready to refund ; and, then, he will be a cheaper servant 
to me than any I could hire at this time, by far ; and his honesty, care, fidelity, and prudence stand unimpeached. . .
