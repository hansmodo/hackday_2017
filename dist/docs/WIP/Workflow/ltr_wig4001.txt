Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I cannot let Mr. Listen go, without taking the occasion 
of his departure to recommend him to you, and to express 
my hope that his character and conduct will be found well 
calculated to continue and promote that harmony, which it 
was the object of our labours to establish. I have, since 
you left us, taken one occasion to renew to you my assurances of the sincere esteem and friendship with which your 
whole conduct has impressed me, and of the high sense 
which I entertain of your virtues and talents. It is a great 
satisfaction to one, when, in the course of so many unpleasant 
discussions as a public man must necessarily be engaged 
in, he is able to look back upon any of them with as much 
pleasure, as I derived from that which procured me the 
advantage of friendship and intercourse with a man valuable on every account. You, I trust, saw enough of me to 
know that these expressions are not, on my part, compliments of course, but that they proceed from sentiments of 
real esteem and regard. 
</p><p>
I need not tell you with how much pleasure, on every 
account, I have learned that the public in the United States 
are recovering from the delusion into which they had been 
led, and that justice is now done by the country at large, as 
it was before by well informed and well principled men, to 
the uprightness and ability of your conduct. I, on my part, 
should have thought, that I very ill consulted the interests 
of my own country, if I had been desirous of terminating 
the points in discussion between us, on any other footing 
than that of mutual justice and reciprocal advantage ; nor 
do I conceive that any just objection can be stated to the 
great work which we jointly accomplished, except on the 
part of those who believe the interest of Great Britain and 
the United States to be in contradiction with each other, 
or who wish to make them so. 
</p><p>
It would be a great gratification to me to learn occasionally that you are well, and that you retain a friendly recollection of one who is, with the greatest sincerity, 
Most truly and faithfully, 
</p><p>
Your obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
