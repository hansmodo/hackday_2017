Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It was not until the last week, that I had the pleasure of 
receiving from Mr. Naylor your obliging and very friendly 
letter of the 24th Feb., <a href='/results.php?year=1798'>1798</a>. Accept my thanks for it. 
</p><p>
Permit me to congratulate you on the promising aspect 
of affairs in Europe. England stands high, and while just, 
no one ought to repine at her prosperity. In my opinion, 
she does not pass for more than she is worth. \ our tax 
on income does honour to the minister who devised it, to 
the parliament who adopted it, and to the people who bear 
it. If hereafter accommodated to a state of peace, it would 
be a powerful auxiliary to your sinking fund. 
</p><p>
Our conversation here turns so much on Great Britain 
and (as some phrase it) her doings, that I find myself insensibly led to these interesting topics. Not only Great Britain, but every other civilized country, will have reason to 
rejoice when the present atrocious war, and the pestiferous 
principles which generated and have protracted it, shall 
cease to distress and to corrupt mankind. May that happy 
period not be distant. 
</p><p>
With great esteem and regard, and the best wishes for 
your health and happiness, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and faithful servant, 
</p><p>
