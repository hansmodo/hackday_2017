SIR: 
</p><p>
It will be necessary that you send down as soon as you can, the witnesses against the several prisoners brought by Lieut. Cone, that they 
may be brought to trial, by a Court Martial, which they cannot be 
without the witnesses being here. Be pleased to cause the proclamations herewith sent to be made known in the district of your regiment. 
I am sir, your humble servant,
