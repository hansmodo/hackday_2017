TO THE EDITOR OF THE TRUE AMERICAN : 
</p><p>
I notice in the papers of the day, have learned from letters, and heard in private circles, that my name is spoken of in connection 
with the office of United States Senator for New Jersey. 
</p><p>
With gratitude to those of my fellow-citizens who have named me for that high office, I must nevertheless say, frankly and at once, that I decline it. 
</p><p>
However averse I may be to enter into questions of party politics, still, permit me to express the hope that the appointment of Senator 
may be conferred on some one whose heart and hand and voice is pledged to the Union of the States at all hazards, and to the sup 
port of the compromises of the Constitution and the execution of the laws with unfaltering fidelity. 
</p><p>
Survive who may, perish who will, the Union must be preserved. To this sentiment, for one, I set my hand and heart, and on its 
maintenance I am now, as I ever have been, ready to pledge my life, my fortune, and my honour. The people of New Jersey have, 
at the late election, adopted it and made it theirs, and every citizen everywhere, who loves his country and his race, will respond to it with enthusiasm.

R. F. STOCKTON.
