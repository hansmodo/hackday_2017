MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IN your letter of December 23d, you say, " Faxon wants 
money to buy three cows and four young cattle." I 
know not the price of stock, but if you can purchase 
him what he wants, at a reasonable rate, and can find 
means to pay for them, I shall be content ; but I 
would employ some one to purchase them in Bridge- 
water or Abington. Faxon himself is not so judicious as he ought to be in some things. 
</p><p>
I have the same aversion to the multiplication of 
banks, and the same apprehension of their pernicious 
tendency, as you express. But so many people 
live upon them that they will have their course. We 
shall soon be perplexed and distressed in consequence of them. I consider myself already as taxed one 
half of my salary and one half of all the interest of 
my money to support bankers and bankrupts. In 
short, debtors and men of no property will find means 
in our state of society to compel others who have 
something, not only to pay their debts for them, but 
to support them. It falls hardest on widows, orphans, salary men, and those who have money at 
interest, except such of these last as are at liberty 
to speculate. They are able to make what money 
they please.

I received yesterday the votes from Kentucky. 
They are said to be all for <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>. Let us, 
my dear, prepare our minds, and as well as we can, 
our circumstances, to get out of this miserable 
scramble. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to read that you are making 
preparations of timber for a corn-house, and I hope 
Shaw will be as attentive as he can through the whole 
winter to all my manufactures of manure, that we 
may make a good cornfield in the summer.

I had yesterday a charming letter from Charles. 
According to him, had the electors of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
been chosen by the people, their votes would have 
been very different. The representation of the people in their present legislature is very unequal and 
partial in favor of the Antis and Clinton, as he has 
explained very intelligibly. Mr. Taylor, the new 
senator from Virginia, has made a motion for opening our doors and building a gallery ; but he will not 
be assisted in his argument by the late example of 
Virginia, where the electors at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> opened 
their doors and held debates and made philippics be 
fore " the Marseillois," by which means six votes are 
said to have been converted either by reasoning or by 
fear. This example will not convince the majority 
of the senators of the necessity, expediency or propriety of opening their doors. 
</p><p>
I have a warm chamber with a southern exposure, 
and have a fire in it day and night. I am warm 
enough o nights, but cannot sleep as I ought. I have 
scarcely had a complete night's sleep since I left 
you, which keeps me apprehensive of the fever and 
ague in the spring. I hope, however, to escape it. I 
shall not be able to leave this place until the fifth or 
sixth of March. The roads will be bad and the journey by the stage fatiguing, but I, who was born to be 
a slave must fulfil the end of my creation. 
Tenderly, 
</p><p>

Blanchard to-day is to set all the world upon the 
broad stare at his balloon. I wish H. would make 
it an interlude and send him back to Europe.
