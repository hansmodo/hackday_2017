DEAR COUSIN : 
</p><p>
I am sorry to find that you have not yet heard any thing from. our 
uncle, respecting his ideas upon his situation at the present crisis, and 
this induces me to trouble you with this letter. 
</p><p>
You will know to what a low ebb our affairs were reduced at the 
Northward; and that it is the received opinion that they were so reduced by the underhand management of persons on the other side of 
the question, from principle, or hopes of regaining their offices. In 
short, our moderation to such persons almost ruined our cause. You 
know, also, the inclination of our public, to expel such persons from 
among us, and the difficulty of any discrimination of persons, lest while 
every man endeavored to save his friend, the measure itself be defeated. 
</p><p>
At length, driven thereto by recent danger, we have brought in an 
ordinance for the banishment of crown officers and suspected persons, 
upon a contingency therein expressed. Only five persons in the General Assembly appeared against it. You were not present in the debate, 
and I will, therefore, tell you what I said introductory to my support 
of the ordinance. My situation was truly disagreeable. I spoke but 
once, the last in the debate; and, considering the lead I have taken 
hitherto, it would have been justly and injuriously remarked, if on such 
a question I had been absent or silent. The conclusion of my last 
charge to the grand jury must have condemned me. I arose deeply 
impressed with a feeling I had never before experienced, and having 
observed that I was more tenderly interested in the debate than any 
man in the room, I lamented that the time was come when the public 
welfare called upon us to adopt measures that might effect the tranquility of our nearest relations ; that I was sensible the present measure 
might effect, in its operation, a gentlemen to whom I was nearly related 
by blood to whom I owe the greatest obligations, and to whom I bore 
the most respectful affection ; that I was fully aware my appearing in 
support of such a measure would open the mouth of calumny to reproach me as an ingrate a man void of natural affection. That it was 
out of my power to avoid reproach; but that as it was my inclination 
and duty, so it was in my power to avoid giving just occasion for censure. That there were various duties, public and private, each rising in gradation; that it was a first principle in society, that our duty to our 
country was the first of the social duties ; that America had engaged in 
the present war upon this principle, and that our independence was to 
be supported only by carrying that principle into practice. In short, 
that in this particular case, as in all others, I firmly trusted that my 
conduct was, and would be, a sufficient refutation of every calumny. 
I then proceeded to support the ordinance, which I held to be absolutely necessary. 
</p><p>
Having in this manner supported the uniform vigor of my public 
conduct, to find a flaw in which my private enemies have always sought, 
and having thus discharged my duty to the public, I lost no time, you 
know, to discharge my duty to our respected relation. I sought you 
through the town, told you what had happened, and laid down the only 
means by which, in my opinion, our uncle could with credit . preserve 
his tranquility. Many weeks ago I informed him such an event was to 
be expected, and I have never mentioned this conversation to any person 
but yourself. Let us consider what our uncle may do. 
</p><p>
We know his situation. His good sense and integrity stand confessed. I will not determine upon his opinion respecting the present 
controversy. But, without any imputation, he may resign to the King 
of Great Britain, by a letter containing some such representation as the 
following. We will send the letter to Congress, and they, by a flag of 
truce, will send it to Lord Howe to be forwarded, 
</p><p>
His infirmities of body, his advanced age, and the calamities of his 
country, which he can neither remedy nor alleviate by a continuance in 
office, impel him to resign a commission which he had accepted and 
hitherto held, only because it enabled him to serve his country. That 
his laborious services under the crown, from his early youth, entitled 
him to a retirement from public business in his advanced age; and that 
his infirmity of body, distress of mind and age, demanded a release 
from labor. 
</p><p>
Is there an idea in that representation inconsistent with fact, or injurious to his character ? Can such sentiments and corresponding con 
duct endanger him under the crown, or give offence to posterity ? No ! 
But even such sentiments will satisfy his countrymen and conemporaries. 
How really fortunate, therefore, is his situation, who at such a time as 
the present can procure not only safety but tranquility, on both sides, 
by a conduct satisfactory to his countrymen, without incurring blame 
in the eyes of posterity! 
</p><p>
I am persuaded no man has our uncle's tranquility, welfare and 
honor, more at heart than you have, and I am satisfied you do not, on 
these points, think amiss of me. I am also convinced that upon the 
subject of this letter no person can discourse to him so freely as your, 
self. His situation is perilous with respect to his tranquility, and no 
time ought to be lost, or importunity omitted, in representing such a 
conduct, and pressing him to adopt it, as may ensure his tranquility. 
</p><p>
If he resigns, let his letter be by you delivered open to the President, who will seal and forward it to Congress. The letter ought to 
be dated before Wednesday next. These things done, he will not be interrupted in his retirement. If there shall be occasion for your producing the letter, I shall ask you for it on Wednesday. If I do not 
then ask you for it, you may return it back, observing a profound silence to me and to every other person upon the subject, whether you 
ever received such a letter or not. For while by importunity I am inclined to do a violence to his judgment to preserve his tranquility, I 
am unwilling that he should unnecessarily do any thing against his free inclination. Adieu.
