Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to receive this morning your favor of the 
twenty-third of January,  with its enclosures, excepting the 
cypher which seems accidentally to have been omitted in making up your despatches, or perhaps it has been put by mistake 
in the letters directed to Mr Short, which at Mr Johnson's re 
quest I have taken charge of. I shall deliver it as speedily as 
may be, intending to make my arrangements for leaving this 
city as soon as the present holidays -are over. 
</p><p>
Nothing can be more just, than your observations respecting 
the propriety of preserving silence as to the government of 
France ; and they are peculiarly applicable to the present state 
of things in that country. Changes are now so frequent, and 
events seem fast ripening to such awful catastrophes, that no 
expressions on the subject, however moderate, would be received with indifference. 
</p><p>
Feeling with you the importance of our commercial connexions, I shall of course lend all my attention to establish and 
extend them. Permit me to entreat, my dear Sir, that you 
will send me all the information, which can be collected on the 
subject. If, at the same time, you could favor me with the particular points which it is desired to carry, I shall feel myself 
more at ease than in a general pursuit, which may perhaps be 
directed to objects less important than I may suppose them. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the accurate statement you have been so 
kind as to make, respecting my salary, &c. and you may rely 
that I shall exactly conform to your wishes on that head. And 
I take this opportunity to say, that you will never receive from me any observations respecting the amount. If it proves in 
sufficient, I will supply the want from my own funds, as far 
as they will permit, and the balance must be made up by retrenchment. 
</p><p>
As you have yourself run through the career, which I am 
now about to commence, you know much better than I do the 
importance of early information, and therefore I feel more 
confidence in acting under you, than I should in any other situation. If you would kindly afford me your good counsel, it 
would confer a great obligation. Pardon me, I pray you, one 
observation. The distance of America is such, that probable 
events are almost of equal importance with those which have 
actually happened, because measures must be squared in some 
degree to the one as much as to the other. You will from 
hence infer my desire to know on some subjects the best opinion which can be formed ; and I am sure I cannot better ad 
dress myself for that purpose than to you. I am, &c.
