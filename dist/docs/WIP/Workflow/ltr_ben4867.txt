DEAR SON : I wrote to you per the October Packet, and 
have not since had any Line from you. I spent 16 Days 
at Lord Le Despencer's most agreably, and returned in good 
Health and Spirits. Lord Dartmouth came to town last Week, 
and had his first Levee on Wednesday, at which I attended. 
He received me very politely in his Room, only Sec y Pownall 
present, expressing some Regret that he happened to be from 
home when I was near him in the Country, where he had hop'd 
for the Pleasure of seeing me, &c. I said I was happy to see 
his Lordship in his present Situation, in which for the good 
of both Countries I hoped he would long continue; and I 
begged Leave to recommend my Son to his Protection, who, 
says I, is one of your Governors in America. The Sec y 
then put in And a very good Governor he is. Yes, says 
my Lord, he has been a good Governor, and has kept his 
Province in good Order during Times of Difficulty. I 
then said that I came at present only to pay my Respects, 
and should wait on his Lordship another Day on Business; 
to which he said he should always be ready to hear me and 
glad to see me. I shall attend his Levee again to-day, on 
some N. England Affairs, and hope we may now go on more 
smoothly; but Time will show.

As the Boards are met again, the Ohio Affair will again be 
put forward as soon as Mr. Walpole comes to [town? mutilated in record], who went lately into Norfolk. I am almost 
settled in my new Apartment; but Removing, and sorting 
my Papers, and placing my Books and things has been a 
troublesome Job. I am amaz'd to see how Books have 
grown upon me since my Return to England. I brought 
none with me, and have now a Roomfull ; many collected in 
Germany, Holland and France; and consisting chiefly 
of such as contain Knowledge that may hereafter be useful 
to America. 
</p><p>
My Love to Betsey concludes at present from your affecdonate Father B FRANKLIN
P. S. I was this day again at Lord Dartmouth's Levee, 
who show'd me particular Respect in sending for me out 
of the Crowd long before my Turn, and apologizing for having 
kept me so long by Means of Mr. Maseres's detaining him on 
Canada Affairs. He receiv'd my Business too very properly, 
not making any Objection to my acting as Agent for the 
Massachusetts without the Gov " Approbation of my Appointment, as his Predecessor had done. Whether this will continue or not, is now the Question; for as he has the same 
Secretaries, Pownall and Knox, probably they will remind him 
of the late Measures, and prompt him to continue them.
