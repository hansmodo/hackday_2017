My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
This letter will be in reply to what you have been so kind 
as to write respecting my nomination as minister to the court 
of France. I feel as I ought the honor conferred by the 
President in making it, and whatever may be its fate in the 
Senate, I shall always count his suffrage among the most flattering events of my life. I find that no decision was made 
down to the evening of the ninth of January, though the first 
consideration was in the morning of the twenty-third of December, being in the whole eighteen days that it had hung by 
the eyelids. J\ mischievous consequence of the delay is, that 
foreign powers will suppose there is a great division of sentiment, and of course the Minister will have less weight, at 
least for some time, and if a bare majority should eventually 
approve, that circumstance also will operate in the same way. 
To obviate evil, so far as the other gentlemen may be concerned, I have declared here to those who have wondered at 
the delay, that I believe the exceptions, if any, are against 
me. It has been reported, that the exception was to making 
any appointment whatever ; but I have declared my belief 
that this was not the case, for you will observe that such opinion presupposes that the President was precipitate, whereas 
the law passed on the subject is of long standing. On the 
whole, I have thought it best to make myself the scape goat 
of the flock, because if disapproved of, it will then appear all 
natural enough, and if appointed, I must work through the difficulties as well as I can ; they will be less important to my 
country, on the other side of the channel, and my great object is her interest. 
</p><p>
The mission to France must be a stormy one, let it fall on 
whom it may. You will have seen that every character, both 
in and out of that country, is very rudely handled by their 
journalists. These gentlemen stick not to declare that <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> is a mercenary traitor, sold to the Aristocratic faction. When such things are said, read, and believed by 
the vulgar, you will judge what likelihood there is that reason 
should be heard, or truth prevail. However, as mankind must 
in all countries come to their senses either sooner or later, there 
is no reason to doubt that a proper conduct will at length succeed. 
You will observe, that it was not in the nature of things possible 
to make an appointment from America, which would have been 
unexceptionable, and to have made none would have been offensive, for the conclusion would have been that America looked with contempt at their present situation. 
</p><p>
That kingdom is split up into parties, whose inveteracy of hatred is hardly conceivable, and the Royalists and Aristocrats 
consider America, and the Americans, as having occasioned 
their misfortunes. The former charge it upon us as ingratitude, 
seeing that it was the King who stepped forward to our relief. 
Should this party get the better in the struggle, there are very 
few Americans who would, for the present, be well received. 
On the other hand, the republicans consider everything short 
of downright democracy, as an abandonment of political principle, in an American. I could dwell minutely on both sides 
of this question ; but a word to the wise is sufficient. To 
stand well with all parties is impossible, but it is possible, and 
merely so, to stand well with the best people in all parties, 
without greatly offending the others ; and in order to do this, 
a man must make up his mind to hear the virtuous traduced by 
the wicked, and to listen unruffled to calumny, folly, and even 
to insanity. I am in hopes, however, that things will ere long 
come to some more steady bearing, though the present prospect is by no means flattering or fair. The Bishop d Autun 
tells me that the ministry are all disjointed, each undermining 
the other, and the Assembly at war with them all. I am, &c.
