Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On returning from Exeter the evening before the last, I 
had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 13th inst. 
with the two copies mentioned in it. Having no apprehension of such measures, what was to be done appeared 
to me a question of some difficulty as well as importance. 
To treat them as very important might render them more 
so than I think they are. The author of McFingal could 
do justice to the subject. The assumption will do its own 
work. It will justify itself, and not want advocates. Every 
indecent interference of State assemblies will diminish 
their influence. The national government has only to do 
what is right, and if possible, be silent. If compelled to 
speak, it should be in few words, strongly evincive of ternper, dignity, and self-respect. Conversation and desultory 
paragraphs will do the rest. 
</p><p>
The national government gains ground in these countries, 
and I hope care will be taken to cherish the national spirit 
which is prevailing in them. The deviation from contract 
touching interest does not please very universally. An 
individual remarked, that while Congress thought themselves authorized to take such liberties, private property 
could not be secure in a national bank. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
John J a v.
