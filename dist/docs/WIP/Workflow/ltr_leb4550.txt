Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to inform you, that the King has made 
choice of M. Bonne-Carrere, director general of the Departe-ment Politique  to succeed M. Ternant as minister plenipotentiary from France to the United States. M. Bonne-Carrere 
regrets that it has not been in his power to announce to you 
himself his nomination to a post, which will continue and he 
hopes will augment his relations with you. But he is prevented by a very severe rheumatic attack, which not only confines 
him to his bed, but disables him from every kind of effort. He 
will seize the first moment after his recovery to call and see 
you, but he is not willing to delay any longer to reiterate to 
you the assurances of his zeal, and the sentiments with which 
you have inspired him. 
</p><p>
I undertake with great pleasure on this occasion the office of 
his interpreter, and I have the honor to be^ &;c.
