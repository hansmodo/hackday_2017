My dear Sir 
</p><p>
... I am very much obliged to you for the intimation of your purpose of mentioning the Bank in your next report. 
Independant of the pleasure of seeing its usefulness recognized from so high a source, it may perhaps be useful with 
regard to others who have hitherto not been so well disposed &amp; who now seemed destined to have an influence hereafter 
over that subject, so far as respects the country I am perfectly satisfied from as intimate a knowledge as I possess of 
any subject, that [but] for the presence of the Bank the currency of the country would in two months time relapse into 
confusion, &amp; that the public revenue, becoming of unequal value at every part of the Union would be subject to loss &amp; 
delay &amp; expence in making transfers which would be incalculable injurious. It occurs to me &amp; I therefore venture the 
suggestion that the subject might be appropriately introduced at that part of the report, which will naturally state 
the amount of debt extinguished during the last four years. It would then be satisfactory to add, that the whole of this 
amount, in addition to the ordinary receipts &amp; disbursements, after being collected in various quarters of this extensive 
country are transferred to the several points where the public debt is payable, &amp; actually disbursed for that purpose 
without the delay of amount, or the expense of a dollar or the slightest risk the Bank being responsible for the con 
duct of the agents while in England, the Gov pay more than a million of dollars annually for the management of its 
debt by the Bank of England. What is scarcely less important is, that from the arrangements made by the Bank for these 
payments, the inconvenience of a great accumulation of money in the vaults of the Gov* followed by an immediate 
distribution of it is entirely obviated. The Bank as the period of payment approaches, anticipates in the form of discounts 
the disbursement of a considerable portion of the Stock and the rest becomes absorbed in the mass of its operations 
so that many millions are paid on a given day, without the slightest previous pressure, or any consciousness on the part 
of the community of such an operation, which unless skilfully made, may produce inconvenient shocks &amp; fluctuations. . . .
