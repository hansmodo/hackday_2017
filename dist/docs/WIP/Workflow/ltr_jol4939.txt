My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have barely time to thank you for your kind letter 
accompanied by the speech and letter of President 
Rutledge, on the subject of his resignation. As I 
have not found a leisure moment proper for submit 
ting them to the perusal of the General, I take the 
liberty of detaining them till another opportunity 
offers. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, I have in general terms communicated the intelligence to his Excellency. 
</p><p>
My opinion was formed immediately upon reading 
the matter over. I certainly think Mr. President is 
right in the principle which he lays down relative to 
the limited powers of those to whom the people have 
committed that Constitution, by which they wish to be 
governed. They are to make laws conformably to the Constitution, but they have no authority to alter or change the Constitution. I disagree with him 
when he makes our present form of government have 
such an absolute respect to an accommodation with G* 
Britain, and when he declares the present Constitution of S. Carolina to be the best we are capable of 
receiving ; but I hope to have time to speak more fully 
on this subject in my next. 
</p><p>
The conduct of Congress in giving orders to officers on detached commands, without communicating 
them to the General, is not only a deficiency of politeness, considered as an omission of a compliment 
which is due to him, but likewise a breach of military 
propriety. He ought undoubtedly to be acquainted 
with whatever orders arc given to those who are 
at the same time under his command, that he may 
govern himself by them and not be exposed to contrariate them. We expect the pleasure of Gen'l Lee's 
company to dinner, and are preparing to receive him 
with distinction. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dearest friend and father. 
</p><p>
I am ever your affectionate 
</p><p>
