</p><p>
I sent, by the express, an answer to your letter respecting the office of Adjutant-General, and gave what appeared 
to me sufficient reasons to excuse my declining to accept it ; 
but I have since been uneasy lest you should deem them 
otherwise, and that I was too willing, under the civil offices 
I sustain, to shelter myself from the dangers and fatigues 
of war, an opinion which, if it has taken place, I wish 
to remove. 
</p><p>
The case was this : I had concluded to accept the office, 
but, meeting with a number of unavoidable interruptions in 
the way of business, was unable to give my answer to the 
express till the evening, at eight o clock, at which time I 
had directed him to call ; and it was then, in fact, sealed up, 
and ready to be delivered, the same which I now enclose 
to your Excellency. But, the express delaying his coming 
a full hour, I of course continued to revolve the matter in 
my mind, and, upon a review of the reasons on both sides 
of the question, those against my accepting the post, in 
creased by the suggestions of my nearest friend, whose 
happiness and tranquillity of mind lay near my heart, preponderated, and occasioned the answer your Excellency has 
already received. Besides the reasons there given, others 
weighed with me, which I had not time to mention. The 
civil offices I sustain yield me an income that contents me, 
and, in a time of peace, would maintain my family. These 
I must have relinquished, without an expectation of reassuming them. Consequently, had I taken the post of Adjutant-General, and some cause had arisen (an event far from 
impossible) rendering it expedient for me to quit the camp, 
I should have returned divested of the principal means of 
supporting my family. 
</p><p>
Whenever I thought of a military employment, the condition of my eyes was no small discouragement to me. I 
am so near-sighted that I, although placed in the best situation, cannot, with any degree of accuracy, discern the position of a body of men beyond the size of a single regiment. 
It is true, in viewing distant objects, my spectacles help me 
to see nearly as well as people in general do with the naked 
eye ; but they are frail things, and rain or snow beating 
against them (I found in the winter's campaign) so obstructs the vision as to render them almost useless. My 
business as Register of Deeds had, by my absence, got 
behindhand ; it seemed to be daily increasing, and my office 
was not in such order as I wished to leave it in to a successor. These, with the reasons mentioned in my former 
letter, and many others of lesser moment, determined my 
answer in the negative. I regretted the proposal could not 
have been made me while at head-quarters, where I could 
have inquired particularly into the nature and extent of the 
office of Adjutant-General, and thence judged more certainly whether or not I was able to discharge the duties of 
it. The want of such information left doubts on my mind 
that were no small obstacle to my accepting it. 
On the other hand, I am sensible, that to support the 
army is of essential importance ; that, on the failure of it, 
besides the general calamity of my country, every prospect 
of advantage or enjoyment to me must vanish. I have 
been, therefore, ever ready to serve the public to the utmost 
of my power. But perhaps the comforts of civil life, the 
love of ease, the enjoyment of my friends, and the powerful allurements springing from the nearest connection on 
earth, have led me to mistake the object. From a sacred 
regard, therefore, to the interests of my country ; from the 
ardent desire I have to approve myself to your Excellency ; 
from the pain it has given me to deny the request of the 
last of men to whom I would refuse anything, I submit 
the whole matter to your Excellency's determination. If, 
upon a view of all circumstances, you judge it my duty to 
exchange the civil for a military life, I will do it. And 
then, should the office of Adjutant-General (for, from what 
conception I have of it, none would be more agreeable) be 
once more vacant, or any other post or employment present, 
to which you shall deem me competent, I will not again 
confer with flesh and blood, but instantly obey your Excellency's commands. 
I beg your Excellency's pardon for imposing on your 
patience this second long letter. But I feared lest, by my 
backwardness, I might have offended. And I was led to 
make the above tender of my services because your Excellency's good opinion of me, and the urgency of your 
request, have raised me to some importance with myself. 
I am, with the highest veneration and esteem for your 
Excellency, your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant,
