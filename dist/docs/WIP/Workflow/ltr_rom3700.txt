Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your very kind and 
obliging letter of the 4th instant and should sooner 
have replied, but I am kept here in a kind of suspense by the very slow manner of proceeding in the 
Assembly of this State. I am Financier electa, but 
that is all; for had I taken the oath and my commission, my seat in the Assembly must have been 
vacated. And I think it of the utmost consequence 
to preserve my right of appearing there, until the 
tender and penal laws are totally repealed ; for I 
consider those laws as destructive of all credit, even 
amongst private people in dealings with one another. 
But to the public officers, after the experience we 
have had, it is evident that the existence of such 
laws much longer, must totally preclude them from 
every possibility of credit; and in our circumstances 
the war cannot be carried on without it. I have already made such an impression on this siihject, that 
I feel pretty sure those laws will be repealed in this 
State within these few days ; and I expect the other 
Legislatures will readily follow the example. 
</p><p>
I am also pressing our Assembly to levy effective 
taxes in hard money. There are stronger objections 
made to this than the other measure, and they are 
more pertinaciously insisted on. But still they will, 
either wholly or partially, come into this also; and if 
once the ice is broken, they will see such advantages 
flowing from these foundations, as will readily induce 
them to follow up the plans that evidently prove, in 
the operation, how beneficial they are to the country. 
</p><p>
Insuperable obstacles have hitherto prevented me 
from bending my course towards your camp, and it 
seems yet uncertain when it may be in my power ; 
for although I stipulated with Congress that they 
should not rest any part of the present campaign on 
me, yet they cannot refrain, and already much of 
my time and attention is engaged in that way. 
Not having taken any commission, prevents me from 
calling on the several departments for such returns 
as I should choose to have with me when I wait on 
your Excellency ; for my objects are to reduce our 
public expenditures as nearly as possible to what 
they ought to be, and to obtain revenues in our own 
country, to meet those expenses as nearly as can be; 
and then to show foreign nations, engaged in the 
war, that we must look to them for the balance. 
And I am very confident, when they shall see exertions on one hand, and economy on the other, they 
will be willing to assist us all they consistently can. 
The promise you so cheerfully make, of granting all 
the support in your power, increases my own confidence, and I will, before long, engage in the duties 
of my department, with all the energy I am master 
of; that is, provided these tender and penal laws 
are done away. I have the pleasure to hear, that 
Mr Lowry has sent one thousand barrels of flour 
to camp. From <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, I have not yet 
heard. I have the honor to be. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most devoted, humble servant, 
</p><p>
