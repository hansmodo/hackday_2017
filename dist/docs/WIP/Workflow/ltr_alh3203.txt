DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have been detained here these two days by a 
fever, and violent rheumatic pains throughout my 
body. This has prevented my being active in person 
for promoting the purposes of my errand; but I have 
taken every other method in my power, in which 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> has obligingly given me all the aid 
he could. In answer to my pressing application to 
General Poor, for the immediate marching of his brigade, I was told they were under an operation for 
the itch, which made it impossible for them to proceed till the effects of it were over. By a letter, 
however, of yesterday, General Poor informed me he 
would certainly march this morning. I must do him the justice to say, he appears solicitous to join you ; 
and that I believe the past delay is not owing to 
any fault of his, but is wholly chargeable on General 
Putnam. Indeed, Sir, I owe it to the service to say, 
that every part of this gentleman's conduct is marked 
with blunders and negligence, and gives general disgnst. 
Parsons's brigade will join you, I hope, in five or six 
days from this. Learned's may do the same. Poor's 
will, I am persuaded, make all the haste they can for 
the future ; and Glover's may be expected at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a> 
to-night, whence they will be pushed forward, as fast 
as I can have any influence to make them go. But, I 
am sorry to say, the disposition for marching, in the 
officers and men in general, of these troops, does not 
keep pace with my wishes, or the exigency of the 
occasion. They have Unfortunately imbibed an idea 
that they have done their part of the business of the 
campaign, and are now entitled to repose. This, and 
the want of pay, make them averse to a long march 
at this advanced season. 
</p><p>
A letter from you to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, of the 9th, 
fell just now into my hands. As it might possibly 
contain something useful to me, I took the liberty of 
opening it, and, after reading it, immediately des 
patched it to him. If he has paid any attention to 
my last letters to him, things will be in a right train 
for executing the order in yours ; but whether he has 
or not, is a matter of doubt. In a letter from him, 
just now received by <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>, he appears to 
have been, on the 10th instant, at King Street, at 
the White Plains. I have had no answer to my last 
applications. 
</p><p>
The enemy appear to have stripped <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
very bare. The people there (that is, the Tories) are 
in a very great fright. This adds to my anxiety 
that the reinforcements from this quarter to you are 
not in greater forwardness and more considerable. 
</p><p>
I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a>, informing him of 
the accounts of the situation of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> with respect to troops, and the probability of the force gone to Howe being greater than was at first expected, to 
try if this will not extort from him a further reenforcement. I do not, however, expect much from 
him, as he pretends to have in view an expedition 
against <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, to be undertaken in the winter; 
and he knows that, under the sanction of this idea, 
calculated to catch the Eastern people, he may, with 
out censure, retain the troops. And as I shall be 
under a necessity of speaking plainly to your Excellency when I have the pleasure of seeing you, I 
shall not hesitate to say, I doubt whether you would 
have had a man from the Northern army if the 
whole could have been kept at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> with any decency. Perhaps you will think me blainable in not 
having exercised the powers you gave me, and givena positive order. Perhaps I have been so ; but, deliberately weighing all circumstances, I did not, and 
do not, think it advisable to do it, I have the honor 
to be, with unfeigned esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
