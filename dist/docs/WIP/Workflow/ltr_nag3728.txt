Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 29th of December, 
came to hand yesterday. The reenforcement you 
mention has not arrived, and I hope they are gone 
to another quarter. I got intelligence of the preparation making in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and of the opinion of their 
being destined to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. But whether they went 
to some other quarter, or the small reenforcement 
mentioned in my last was what gave rise to the report, I am unable to say. 
</p><p>
In your Excellency's instructions to correspond with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a>, you did not tell me whether 
I was to request aid of him in cases of emergency. 
However, my apprehensions were so great, and the 
consequences appeared to me so fatal to this country, 
I made application, without hesitation ; and I should 
be glad to know your mind on the subject, by which 
I shall govern my conduct in future. I see little prospect of getting any reenforcements from Virginia, as 
will appear by the Governor's letter. The State conceive themselves ill-treated, and, however groundless 
it may be, it will operate greatly to our prejudice 
for a time. Colonel Carrington is gone to Congress, 
to represent several matters, which claim immediate 
attention. I wish no disagreeable disputes may happen from the present uneasiness and discontent prevailing in Virginia, from a persuasion that the Northern States are treated with more delicacy than she 
is. I fear the Financier-General will have a hard 
task to steer clear of suspicions of partiality. Colonel Carrington will represent to your Excellency our 
apprehensions of fixing the laboratory at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, 
and our wishes for having it at New London. 
</p><p>
Inclosed are the returns of the Pennsylvania line, 
agreeably to your Excellency's direction. Those of 
Maryland and Delaware are transmitted to the Governors of those States. That of Virginia shall be also 
sent, as soon as it can be had. The absence of Colonel White's regiment of dragoons in Georgia is the 
reason of its delay; however, the infantry of that 
State with this army amount to not more than sixty 
men. In a very few days I will have the honor of 
transmitting to you exact returns of the operating 
force serving under my command in the Southern department. I am, with the greatest regard, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
