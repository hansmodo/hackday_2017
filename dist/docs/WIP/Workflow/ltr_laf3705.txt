Dear General, 
</p><p>
Had your Excellency's answer to my letter of the 
8th been forwarded with an equal celerity with your 
favor of the 6th, I should have received it before this 
time. But whatever change my new situation could 
make in your Excellency's dispositions, I thought it 
my duty in the meanwhile to obey the positive orders I had received. The troops are now crossing 
the feny, and will, with all possible speed, proceed to 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. 
</p><p>
By a letter just received from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, I 
find that he is strongly of opinion that I must go to 
the southward. His intention is to carry the seat of 
war into South Carolina, thereby preventing a junction between Arnold and Cornwallis. He gives me 
many excellent reasons to justify the movement. He 
requests me to move to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> ; and this will, if 
possible, increase my zeal to execute your Excellency's orders. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s opinion is, that Lord 
Cornwallis will fall down towards Wilmington. His 
own project is, to carry the war into South Carolina. 
Under these circumstances a corps of light infantry, 
embarked at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> on board a light squadron, 
might have been upon the seat of war in a very 
short passage. I cannot help fearing, my dear General, that our campaign will take a defensive turn, 
which is far from answering our first plans and expectations. 
</p><p>
Major Macpherson is with me as a volunteer. That 
officer has most zealously employed himself, and has 
been most dangerously exposed in the discovery of a 
plot made to furnish the enemy with provisions. He 
has managed this matter with infinite address, being 
for two days and one night with six soldiers, who, as 
well as himself, put on the air of British, and in 
company with a spy who thought them to be the 
enemy ; and, by a most violent gale of wind, crossed 
the Bay in a small boat, by which means he was 
made sensible that a trade of flour is carried on with 
the enemy from the western shore of Maryland ; and 
saved a magazine of eight hundred barrels of Continental flour, which would otherwise have fallen into 
the hands of the enemy. In case we proceed southerly, perhaps it will be possible for <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> 
to give Major Macpherson a command in some detachment; and I should be happy, if he was recommended to him by your Excellency. 
</p><p>
My determination being to go on with rapidity, 
unless I am recalled, your Excellency may easily judge of my movements from the answer I shall probably receive in a few hours. Was I to assure your 
Excellency, that this journey is perfectly agreeable 
to the troops, I should not use that candor which 
you have so many rights to expect. But their zeal 
and discipline insure their readiness to obey. I shall 
do my utmost to prevent desertion; and, unless I am 
recalled, I shall proceed with celerity. But I beg 
your Excellency to remember, that experience has 
often taught us how much reduced has ever been 
the number of our troops, from the time of their departure to that of their arrival at the Southern army. 
With the highest and most affectionate respect, &c., 
</p><p>
