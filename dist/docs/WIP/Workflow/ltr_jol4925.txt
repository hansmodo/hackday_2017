My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I am happy in having the pleasure of introducing to 
your acquaintance, Colonel Fitzgerald, the senior aid 
in our family. 
</p><p>
His affairs call him to Virginia, and as he means to 
pass through <a href='/results.php?city=york town' rel='city'>York Town</a>, you will have an opportunity of learning many things, viva voce, from him, 
which are not so well committed to writing. 
</p><p>
Your most dutiful and affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
