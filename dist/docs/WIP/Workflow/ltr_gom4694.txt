Sir, 
</p><p>
The Captains of American vessels brought into your ports, 
and persons interested in the said vessels and their cargoes, 
address to me very serious complaints, which seem but too 
well founded. 
</p><p>
I will not here examine the measure itself, excusable per 
haps on account of the extraordinary circumstances in which 
the Republic is placed. But even could severe necessity 
justify a violation of the rights of a neutral and allied nation, 
she ought, at Jeast, to expect to suffer only the inevitable 
grievances arising from this violation. She has a right to 
expect, that the French Republic will be so much the more 
liberal and prorhpt in making compensation for these forced 
supplies, as the method by which she took possession of them 
was uncommon. 
</p><p>
But T see with regret that those who, sailing for France, had 
the misfortune to be carried into England, have had less cause 
of complaint, than those who have been brought into the ports 
of the Republic. Here delays and expense consume the 
whole. Some of the American vessels have been retaken, 
but the Captains, kept with part of their crews, on board the 
French vessels, which had captured them, have not been 
informed of their recapture until their arrival in some port of 
the Republic, where for months they have solicited indemnification, assistance, means of subsistence, and permission to 
depart. I am sorry to add that all their solicitations have 
been fruitless. The Captains Florence, Donavan, and Benjamin Rogers, carried into Brest by the ship VImpetueux, 
Captain I Eveque, are in this predicament. 
</p><p>
Many vessels and American cargoes, among others the 
cargo of the Danish ship, le Krageroc, are in the same port, 
and I am told, that there is no one there, authorised by the 
Republic, to treat for the cargoes, to pay the freight of the 
vessels, or to fix the indemnification, xvhich the aggrieved 
persons think they have a right to demand. Thus the unfortunate men captured at sea, by the ships of an allied nation, 
and carried prisoners into her remote ports, find themselves, 
although without means and almost destitute of resources, 
obliged to undertake a long and expensive journey to obtain 
that justice, which at least can only be rendered to them in the 
ports which they have left, since it is there that the articles 
must be proved, and their prices regulated according to their 
quality. 
</p><p>
I hope, Sir, that the most precise orders will be despatched 
to remedy these grievances, and that you will soon enable me 
to give a satisfactory account of them to the American 
Government. I have the honor to be, &LC.
