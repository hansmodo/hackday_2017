Dear General, 
</p><p>
I arrived here the last night, and this morning 
had the honor of congratulating Monsieur le <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Compte De Rochambeau</a>, and Monsieur le <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague met'>Chevalier De Ternay</a>, 
on their safe arrival in this harbour. The fleet consists of seven sail of the line ; â€” the Due de Burgogne, of eighty guns ; Le Neptune and Le Conquerant, of seventy-four; Le Jason, L'Eville, L' Ardent, 
and Le Provence, of sixty-four; Le Fantasque, hospital ship, of sixty-four, mounts forty guns; two frigates and two bombs, with about five thousand land forces and one thousand marines. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants appear disposed to treat our allies 
with much respect. The town is to be illuminated 
this evening, by a vote of the inhabitants. For myself, I am charmed with the officers. I have promised them every assistance in my power. Monsieur 
Rochambeau has desired me to publish an advertisement, inviting the inhabitants to bring small meats, 
vegetables, &c., to market, and that they shall receive 
hard money in payment. This the Count intended 
with a good view to our currency. I have told him it will have a different effect, and that even at a 
distance. I shall, therefore, only assure the farmers 
that they will receive a handsome price. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. Inclosed is copy of a resolve of the General Assembly of this State. I have ventured to grant a 
pardon to such deserters from <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Greene</a>'s regiment as return by the first of September next, and 
hope it will meet your Excellency's approbation, as 
some of the deserters are at a distance.
