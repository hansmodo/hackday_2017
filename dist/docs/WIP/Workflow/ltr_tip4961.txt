SIR, 
</p><p>
I esteem it a singular honor done me by your Excellency in offering me the post of Adjutant-General ; and it 
pains me sensibly that I am obliged to decline it. It is an 
honor to which I did not aspire, because I did not account 
myself equal to the important business of the office. Your 
Excellency does not mistake my attachment to the interest 
of the United States. It is sincere and unalterable. But 
my military character, which you are pleased to mention as 
a motive to the appointment, is, in my own estimation, of 
no great account. I have, it is true, studied the rudiments 
of the military art, but have very small, or rather no, pre 
tensions to capacity and skill in the important scenes of 
war, and much fear I should disappoint your Excellency's 
expectations concerning me. 
I have domestic reasons and private concerns which 
powerfully urge my staying at home ; but these I should 
not mention, did they exist alone. But, besides the command of a regiment of militia on the sea-coast, I hold divers 
civil offices, which are sufficient to engage my constant 
attention : those of Judge of one of the maritime courts, 
Judge of the inferior Court of Common Pleas, acting Justice of the Peace, and Register of Deeds for the county of 
Essex. The exercise of these offices I could, without any 
very great inconvenience, quit for a season ; and therefore, 
at the time of making the late levy of militia, as there 
appeared some backwardness in the people, I encouraged 
their engaging, and stepped forth and offered my own personal service. 
Nevertheless, I would for ever abandon all these employments, if I thought myself capable of doing more ser 
vice to my country by acting in the office to which your 
Excellency has been pleased to invite me. But, as I do 
not thus think of myself, and conceive it not difficult to 
find a person not otherwise employed, and, to say the least, 
as able to discharge the duties of the office as I, I must beg 
leave to decline it. 
I am, with the greatest veneration, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR.
