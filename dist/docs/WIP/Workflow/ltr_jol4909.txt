My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Since I had the pleasure of writing to you by 
Baron Frey, and the Chevalier du Portail, the siege 
of Fort Mifflin has been continued with great vigour and the new batteries open'd by the enemy on the 
10th have thrown their 24 and 32 pounders with 
great success. A considerable breach was made on 
the 11th in the masonry of the fort, many palisades 
were level'd, the block houses almost ruin'd, several 
cannon dismounted, and a valuable artillery officer 
kill'd. In these circumstances the commanding officer Lieut. Col. Smith thought proper to consult with 
Brigadier Gen'l Varnum who is stationed at Woodberry near Fort Mercer on Red Bank, upon the 
propriety of evacuating the post. It was determined 
that the superfluous cannon, provisions and artillery 
stores should be removed and that a show of de 
fence should be kept up as long as possible. The 
commander in chief considering the importance of 
this place, which if it should fall into the enemy's 
hands would enable them to annoy our fleet and even 
drive it from the defence of the chevaux de frise, at 
first gave positive orders to maintain it at all events. 
These, however, were changed for discretionary orders 
in consequence of the great injury which the works 
had sustained. On the night of the 11th the enemy's 
fire interrupted the repairs of the fort. Three of their small vessels pass tl between Province Island and the fort to the mouth of the Sclmylkil. On the 
12th there was a great firing and two eighteen 
pounders dismounted. At night the enemy threw 
shells and the garrison was alarmed by thirty of their 
boats. On the 13th they open'd a new battery; our 
block houses were destroyed ; each day there were a 
few kill'd and wounded. The garrison exhausted by 
watching labour and ill health have been relieved. 
The enemy have not been tempted by the success of 
their batteries to storm a small number of men who 
maintained their ground in the ruins of the fort. 
I certainly think it practicable by nocturnal labours 
to complete a work which will bid defiance to storm, 
and cover the garrison from their 32 pounders. The 
engineer who is on the spot, Major Floury, a French 
man, will do every thing that can be done. His zeal 
and talents recommend him to public notice. To 
night the enemy have renewed their tiring.

13th. Nothing like a storm yet from the detachment on Province Island. They content themselves 
with battering by day, and interrupting as much as they can our fatigue parties at night by firing from time to time in which the moonlight is serviceable to them. 
</p><p>
14th. Early this morning a floating battery armed with two heavy cannon was discover'd near the shore of Province Island. The new commandant at Fort 
Mifflin thinks the post tenable in spite of the enemy's land and water batteries. The Engineer Fleury says if lie is supplied from Red Bank with fascines, 
gabions, earth and fatigue-men, he will repair as much as possible each night the havoc made by day. 
What he will principally aim at will be the construction of some flanked work (shaped according to circumstances) which in case the block houses sh'd be 
irreparably lost, may enable the garrison to resist a storm. 
</p><p>
15. There has been firing in the course of the day 
and some scatter'd guns in the evening. 
</p><p>
16. Every account given by persons of different sexes 
and ages who have left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> agrees in these 
points, that the inhabitants are exceedingly distressed 
for want of provision. Officers and soldiers humbled 
by the unexpected resistance of the forts, begin to 
express great anxiety on account of their present 
situation that our unhappy prisoners are treated 
with a barbarity which I think the Britons can only 
venture to be guilty of, because they persuade them 
selves the relation of it will not be believed in the 
present refined age. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen return'd from reconnoitering on the 
other side of Schuylkil say that the Continental flag 
was flying at Fort Mifnin yesterday evening, that the 
enemy by lightering a frigate of her guns had towed 
her through a shallow channel between Hog Island 
and Province Island. 
</p><p>
With this you will receive a <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> paper and a printed handbill which is one of a great number 
lately found in a chest at East Town. The direction 
of the chest is rubb'd off and there were no manuscripts within by which the owner could be discover d; 
each handbill was inscribed with the address which 
you see on this. Capt. Robinson calls for my letter.

Adieu my dear Father.

I had closed my letter persuaded that Fort Mifflin was still ours, when an officer from Red Bank enter'd with Gen'l Yarnum's dispatches. The enemy's fire 
yesterday was universal. Ships, batteries, land and water, one of the latter stationed near the fort threw 
in hand grenades our brave garrison suffer'd considerably some of our best officers wounded and Gen'l Yarnum, I suppose, ordered the fort to be 
evacuated last night. The fort has done infinitely more than was expected of it, and we must repair its loss.
