Dear General, 
</p><p>
This afternoon, fifteen or sixteen British ships of 
war have made their appearance off this harbour, 
to the eastward of Block Island. More than half of 
them, I think, are ships of the line. From appearances, at sun-setting, they intended to come to, under 
Block Island. 
</p><p>
Admiral Graves has probably joined Admiral Arbuthnot, and their design is to block up the fleet of 
Monsieur le <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague met'>Chevalier De Ternay</a>, and, if possible, intercept the expected second division of the French 
fleet. I thought it my duty to give immediate notice to your Excellency, and beg leave to submit the 
expediency of some small cruisers being immediately 
sent from the Delaware, to cruise for the French 
fleet, and direct them to a place of safety. I have 
written to the Council and Navy Board, at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
and proposed the same, in case the fleet should take 
the eastern coast. I have mentioned this to his 
Excellency, <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a>, who was so much 
pleased with it, that he requested I would write, for 
that he should leave it wholly with me. 
</p><p>
This night is spent in mounting a number of guns 
at advantageous posts at the entrance of the harbour, 
to make a cross-fire with the ships, &c. There are 
with the army a number of good engineers, and an 
exceedingly fine corps of artillery, with a numerous 
train of field-artillery, and some battering cannon. 
</p><p>
I had ordered <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Greene</a>'s regiment to march 
immediately for the main army, but, under present 
appearances, I think it best to detain them a few 
days. I have ordered them to take post at Butts's 
Hill, at the north end of the Island, to secure the 
communication. This has given much satisfaction to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a>, and I hope will meet with your 
Excellency's approbation. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
