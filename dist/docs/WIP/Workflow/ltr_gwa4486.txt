Sir, 
</p><p>
I am honored by your Excellency's favors of the 
9th and 10th instant, and with their very interesting 
communications, which you may be assured will be 
kept perfectly secret. I flatter myself, that the whole 
convoy will arrive in safety in some of the eastern 
ports, as I believe the British ships are all cruising off 
the Hook. 
</p><p>
The Count de Barras has furnished me with the result of the second council of war I have so high a 
respect for the opinions of the gentlemen, who composed it, that I should have been satisfied had they 
barely mentioned their adherence to their former determination ; but the new arguments, which have been introduced in favor of the detention of the fleet at 
Rhode Island, leave me no room to doubt the propriety of the measure. 
</p><p>
I am so fully convinced, that your Excellency will 
make no unnecessary delay in your march, that I have 
only occasion to repeat my former request, that it may 
be commenced as soon as circumstances will admit. 
My last accounts from the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> were 
of the 3d of June. The British army, in very considerable force, were then between <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> ; their destination was uncertain ; but from 
their superiority they were at full liberty to go wherever they pleased. The enclosed copy of a letter from 
the President of Congress to me will give the latest 
intelligence from South Carolina. 
</p><p>
Your requisitions to the Count de Grasse extend to 
every thing I could wish. You cannot, in my opinion, 
too strongly urge the necessity of his bringing a body of 
troops with him, more especially as I am very doubtful, 
whether our force can be drawn together by the time 
he proposes to be here. Now four thousand or five 
thousand men, in addition to what we shall certainly 
have by that time, would, almost beyond a doubt, enable us with the assistance of the fleet to carry our object. It is to be regretted, that the Count's stay upon 
the coast will be limited. That consideration is an additional reason for wishing a force equal to giving a 
speedy determination to the operation. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will recollect, that <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> was 
looked upon by us as the only practicable object under 
present circumstances ; but should we be able to secure 
a naval superiority, we may perhaps find others more 
practicable and equally advisable. If the frigate should 
not have sailed, I wish you to explain this matter to 
the Count de Grasse ; for, as I understand it, you have 
in your communication to him confined our views to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> alone. And, instead of advising him to run 
immediately into the Chesapeake, will it not be best to 
leave him to judge, from the information he may from 
time to time receive of the situation of the enemy's fleet upon this coast, which will be the most advantageous quarter for him to make his appearance in ? In the letter, which was written to the minister from 
Weathersfield, in which he was requested to urge the Count to come this way with his whole fleet, Sandy Hook was mentioned as the most desirable point ; because, by coming suddenly there, he would certainly 
block up any fleet, which might be within; and he would even have a very good chance of forcing the 
entrance, before dispositions could be made to oppose him. Should the British fleet not be there, he could 
follow in the Chesapeake, which is always accessible to a superior force. I am, &,c.
