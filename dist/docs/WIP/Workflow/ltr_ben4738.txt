DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
You must needs think the time long that your instruments 
have been in hand. Sundry circumstances have occasioned 
the delay. Mr. Short, who undertook to make the telescope, 
was long in a bad state of health, and much in the country 
for the benefit of the air. He however at length finished the 
material parts that required his own hand, and waited only 
for something about the mounting, that was to have been 
done by another workman ; when he was removed by death. 
I have put in my claim to the instrument, and shall obtain 
it from the executors as soon as his affairs can be settled. It 
is now become much more valuable than it would have been 
if he had lived, as he excelled all others in that branch. The 
price agreed for was one hundred pounds. 
</p><p>
The equal altitudes and transit instrument was undertaken by Mr. Bird, who doing all his work with his own 
hands for the sake of greater truth and exactness, one must 
have patience that expects any thing from him. He is so 
singularly eminent in his way, that the commissioners of 
longitude have lately given him five hundred pounds merely 
to discover and make public his method of dividing instruments. I send it you herewith. But what has made him 
longer in producing your instrument is, the great and hasty 
demand on him from France and Russia, and our Society 
here, for instruments to go to different parts of the world for 
observing the next transit of Venus; some to be used in 
Siberia, some for the observers that go to the South Seas, 
some for those that go to Hudson's Bay. These are now all 
completed, and mostly gone, it being necessary, on account 
of the distance, that they should go this year to be ready on 
the spot in time. And now, he tells me, he can finish yours, 
and that I shall have it next week. Possibly he may keep 
his word. But we are not to wonder if he does not. 
</p><p>
Mr. Martin, when I called to see his panopticon, had not 
one ready; but was to let me know when he should have 
one to show me. I have not since heard from him, but will 
call again. 
</p><p>
Mr. Maskelyne wishes much that some of the governments in North America would send an astronomer to Lake 
Superior, to observe this transit. I know no one of them 
likely to have a spirit for such an undertaking, unless it be 
the Massachusetts, or that have a person and instruments 
suitable. He presents you one of his pamphlets, which I 
now send you, together with two letters from him to me, 
relating to that observation. If your health and strength 
were sufficient for such an expedition, I should be glad to 
hear you had undertaken it. Possibly you may have an 
&kve that is capable. The fitting you out to observe the 
former transit, was a public act for the benefit of science, 
that did your province great honour. 
</p><p>
We expect soon a new volume of the Transactions, in which 
your piece will be printed. I have not yet got the separate 
ones which I ordered.

It is perhaps not so extraordinary that unlearned men, 
such as commonly compose our church vestries, should not 
yet be acquainted with, and sensible of the benefits of metal 
conductors in averting the stroke of lightning, and preserving our houses from its violent effects, or that they should 
be still prejudiced against the use of such conductors, when 
we see how long even philosophers, men of extensive science 
and great ingenuity, can hold out against the evidence of new 
knowledge, that does not square with their preconceptions; 
and how long men can retain a practice that is conformable 
to their prejudices, and expect a benefit from such practice, 
though constant experience shows its inutility. A late piece 
of the Abbe' Nollet, printed last year in the Memoirs of the 
French Academy of Sciences, affords strong instances of 
this : For though the very relations he gives of the effects of 
lightning in several churches and other buildings show clearly, 
that it was conducted from one part to another by wires, 
gildings, and other pieces of metal that were within, or connected with the building, yet in the same paper he objects 
to the providing metalline conductors without the building, 
as useless or dangerous. He cautions people not to ring the 
church bells during a thunder-storm, lest the lightning, in its 
way to the earth, should be conducted down to them by the 
bell-ropes, which are but bad conductors ; and yet is against 
fixing metal rods on the outside of the steeple, which are 
known to be much better conductors, and which it would 
certainly chuse to pass in, rather than in dry hemp. And 
though for a thousand years past bells have been solemnly 
consecrated by the Romish Church, in expectation that the sound of such blessed bells would drive away those storms, 
and secure our buildings from the stroke of lightning; and 
during so long a period, it has not been found by experience, 
that places within the reach of such blessed sound, are safer 
than others where it is never heard ; but that on the contrary, 
the lightning seems to strike steeples of choice, and that at 
the very time the bells are ringing; yet still they continue 
to bless the new bells, and jangle the old ones whenever it 
thunders. One would think it was now time to try some 
other trick; and ours is recommended (whatever this able 
philosopher may have been told to the contrary) by more 
than twelve years' experience, wherein, among the great 
number of houses furnished with iron rods in North America, 
not one so guarded has been materially hurt with lightning, 
and several have been evidently preserved by their means; 
while a number of houses, churches, barns, ships, &c. in 
different places, unprovided with rods, have been struck and 
greatly damaged, demolished, or burnt. Probably the vestries of our English churches are not generally well acquainted 
with these facts; otherwise, since as good Protestants they 
have no faith in the blessing of bells, they would be less excusable in not providing this other security for their respective 
churches, and for the good people that may happen to be 
assembled in them during a tempest, especially as those 
buildings, from their greater height, are more exposed to the 
stroke of lightning than our common dwellings.

I have nothing new in the philosophical way to communicate to you, except what follows. When I was last year in 
Germany ', I met with a singular kind of glass, being a tube 
about eight inches long, half an inch in diameter, with a 
hollow ball of near an inch diameter at one end, and one of 
an inch and half at the other, hermetically sealed, and half 
filled with water. If one end is held in hand, and the other 
a little elevated above the level, a constant succession of large 
bubbles proceeds from the end in the hand to the other end, 
making an appearance that puzzled me much, 'till I found 
that the space not filled with water was also free from air, 
and either filled with a subtile, invisible vapour continually 
rising from the water, and extreamly rarifiable by the least 
heat at one end, and condensable again by the least coolness 
at the other ; or it is the very fluid of fire itself, which parting 
from the hand pervades the glass, and by its expansive force 
depresses the water till it can pass between it and the glass, 
and escape to the other end, where it gets thro' the glass 
again into the air. I am rather inclined to the first opinion, 
but doubtful between the two. 
</p><p>
An ingenious artist here, Mr. Nairne, mathematical 
instrument-maker, has made a number of them from mine, 
and improved them, for his are much more sensible than 
those I brought from Germany. I bor'd a very small hole 
through the wainscot in the seat of my window, through which 
a little cold air constantly entered, while the air in the room 
was kept warmer by fires daily made in it, being winter time. 
I plac'd one of his glasses, with the elevated end against 
this hole ; and the bubbles from the other end, which was in 
a warmer situation, were continually passing day and night, 
to the no small surprize of even philosophical spectators. 
Each bubble discharged, is larger than that from which it 
proceeds, and yet that is not diminished ; and by adding itself 
to the bubble at the other end, that bubble is not increased, 
which seems very paradoxical. 
</p><p>
When the balls at each end are made larger, and the connecting tube very small and bent at right angles, so that the 
balls, instead of being at the ends, are brought on tlje side 
of the tube, and the tube is held so as that the balls are above 
it, the water will be depressed in that which is held in the 
hand, and rise in the other as a jet or fountain ; when it is 
all in the other, it begins to boil, as it were, by the vapour 
passing up through it; and the instant it begins to boil, a 
sudden coldness is felt in the ball held; a curious experiment, this, first observed and shewn me by Mr. Nairne. 
There is something in it similar to the old observation, I 
think mentioned by Aristotle, that the bottom of a boiling 
pot is not warm ; and perhaps it may help to explain that 
fact ; if indeed it be a fact. 
</p><p>
When the water stands at an equal height in both these 
balls, and all at rest ; if you wet one of the balls by means 
of a feather dipt in spirit, though that spirit is of the same 
temperament as to heat and cold, with the water in the glasses, 
yet the cold occasioned by the evaporation of the spirit from 
the wetted ball will so condense the vapour over the water 
contained in that ball, as that the water of the other ball 
will be pressed up into it, followed by a succession of bubbles, 
'till the spirit is all dried away. Perhaps the observations 
on these little instruments may suggest and be applied to 
some beneficial uses. It has been thought that water reduced to vapour by heat was rarified only fourteen thousand 
times, and on this principle our engines for raising water by 
fire are said to be constructed : But if the vapour so much 
rarified from water, is capable of being itself still farther 
rarified to a boundless degree by the application of heat to 
the vessels or parts of vessels containing the vapour (as at 
first it is applied to those containing the water) perhaps a 
much greater power may be obtained, with little additional 
expence. Possibly too, the power of easily moving water 
from one end to the other of a moveable beam (suspended 
in the middle like a scale-beam) by a small degree of heat, 
may be applied advantageously to some other mechanical 
purposes.

The magic square and circle, I am told, have occasioned 
a good deal of puzzling among the mathematicians here; 
but no one has desired me to show him my method of disposing the numbers. It seems they wish rather to investigate 
it themselves. When I have the pleasure of seeing you, I 
will communicate it. 
</p><p>
With singular esteem and respect, I am, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
