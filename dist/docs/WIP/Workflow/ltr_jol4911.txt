My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Mr Boudinot, commissary of prisoners informs me 
that he intends for York to morrow, and if I understand 
him right, wishes that I would give him a letter of 
introduction to you. He is a sensible man and attentive to the duties of his office. 
</p><p>
Your kind letter of the 23 d announces a very accept 
able reinforcement of linnen for which I am exceedingly obliged to you the boots will come in good 
time those which I wear at present are in good 
condition, but where they undergo such hard duty as 
they do in the service of an aide de camp, a relief is 
necessary. The gloves are not so indispensible, I 
have discover'd an old pair which have been washed 
and serve me with reparation ; the woolen ones 
however will be an exceeding good reserve. 
</p><p>
I believe your question relative to the proceedings 
of the enemy since the evacuation of Fort Mimin, 
has been answered in one of my former letters. 
</p><p>
Troops from Province Island immediately possess'd 
themselves of the ruin'd wall and palisades, and threw 
up a battery. At the evacuation of Fort Mercer a 
quantity of powder was fired with intention to blow 
up the magazine and ruin the works however, it had 
but little effect, and the destruction was completed by 
the enemy. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> had prepared to give L'd Cornwallis 
battle, when he was call'd oft by a grand scheme 
which was in agitation the day before yesterday. An 
attack was meditated on the enemy's lines ; a proper 
disposition was plann'd for attacking their redoubts 
vigorously in front, while Greene's detachment embark'd in boats should fall down the river land in the 
city and charge the enemy in their rear. A cannonade from an eminence on the west side of Schuylkil 
was to second these attacks and Potter's Militia were 
to make a show at the bridge. Some were clearly 
for it and some clearly against it ; both parties ignorant 
at the same time of the strength of the works. Our 
Commander in chief wishing ardently to gratify the 
public expectation by making an attack upon the 
enemy yet preferring at the same time a loss of 
popularity to engaging in an enterprise which he could not justify to his own conscience and the more respect 
able part of his constituents, went yesterday to view 
the works. A clear sunshine favoured our observations : we saw redoubts of a very respectable profit, 
faced with plank, formidably fraised, and the intervals between them closed with an abbatis unusually 
strong. General du Portail declared that in such 
works with five thousand men he would bid defiance 
to any force that should be brought against him. I 
was led into all the history which I must beg my dear 
father may be very discreet but now no secret 
however my friends in Carolina may talk of things 
they know without quotation I know my few friends 
there are also discreet, between ourselves in order 
to account for <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a>'s not marching to L'd Cornwallis as every man of experience and judgment, 
thinks it would be madness with our force to make an 
attempt on the enemy in their present situation. 
</p><p>
It follows that in order to guard against L'd Cornwallis's being suddenly recall d, and the enemy's 
marching with their whole force against our army, 
weakened by a considerable detachment, we should 
withdraw <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> from the Jerseys and a 
courier has been accordingly dispatched for that 
purpose. When the junction is form'd we shall 
probably march to some place where the troops may 
be cover'd from the inclemency of the season, and be 
within distance for annoying the enemy's shipping 
and cutting ofT any detachments which they may 
have occasion to make. A position on the other side 
of Schuylkil would unite these two advantages and 
have the additional ones of being in a more plentiful 
country for forage, &ca., and reducing the enemy to 
the passage of a bridge in case they should attempt a 
sudden attack upon us. German Town would cover 
a great many troops, but it would require strong works 
to secure it, and is within surprising distance. 
</p><p>
I was going to speak privately of several public 
matters, but the horses are order d, and what I write 
must be dispatched hastily. The promotion of Col. "Wilkinson to the rank of Brigad'r General has given 
universal disgust in the corps of Continental officers. 
If he had signalized himself, say many of them, by 
any remarkable service, we should have applauded 
Congress for bestowing a well merited reward; but 
we think there is a degradation of rank and an injustice done to senior and more distinguished officers, 
when a man is so extraordinarily advanced for riding 
post with good news. Let Congress reward him with 
a good horse for his speed, but consecrate rank to 
merit of another kind. 
</p><p>
This matter is likely to produce many resignations 
in the line of colonels. Rank has likewise been 
vilified by the indiscriminate distribution of it. Waggon masters, regimental quarter masters, &ca., have 
had titles which cease to be honorable when possessed 
by such personages. 
</p><p>
I had some other things to say but I believe I shall be better employed for the present in sending 
you such extracts as I shall have time to cull from the 
last <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> paper. I give you the paragraphs 
quoted from the English papers first because I am sure 
they will amuse you. 
</p><p>
The great outline of the intended operations is 
said to be this. If France does not absolutely relinquish her present treacherous conduct, which gives 
her all the advantages of a war without any of the 
dangers and losses to declare war against her; 
to send 50,000 foreign troops to America, which are 
actually agreed for; to call home the frigates and 
let them loose on the French commerce, and to form 
a grand expedition with Gen'l Howe's army against 
the W. India Islands; to cede Gibralter and a sugar 
island to Russia, on condition of the Empress send"ing 40,000 men to North America. What seems to 
confirm these circumstances is a commission going 
to Holland to engage transports. 
</p><p>
[The above appear'd in the London papers, a few 
days before the court of France had order'd the rebel 
vessels out of their ports, and prohibited the sale of 
their prizes.] 
</p><p>
PHILADELPHIA. 
</p><p>
" Last Thursday afternoon the rebels at Red-bank, 
horribly panick struck with the loss of their fort at 
Mud Island, which they looked upon as inaccessible 
and indeed was ama/ingly strong blew up their 
magazine and fled from their fortifications which, they 
had been preparing for these six or seven weeks past, 
with all the speed they were masters of, depending 
intirely on the nimbleness of their heels for their 
safety, and were heard by many of the citizens who 
were on the wharves looking at the vessels on fire, 
to cry with the greatest vociferation, Damn you 
drive on drive on run my boys the English are 
coming. 
</p><p>
" The same evening the brave commander of their 
fleet deserted by these their gallant comrades, set fire 
to two of their vessels, and sent them towards the city 
with the flood tide, but not having heart to put in 
execution their mischievous designs, quitted them 
before they reached the town when they drifted on 
the Jersey shore and were burnt. Early the next 
morning with the first of the flood, they would fain 
have stolen by the city with the rest of the fleet, and 
for this purpose sent their galleys on first, which were 
so warmly saluted by the different batteries along shore 
and by the Delaware frigate, that it induced them 
rather to trust terra-firma than their floating fortresses 
for the security of their persons, and setting fire 
to their ships, kebecs, brigs, schooners, sloops, &ca., 
abandoned them leaving their rigging, sails and 
every thing else on board, to the mercy of the flames, 
which burnt with such rapidity that it was impossible 
to save any part. Some of the vessels drove opposite 
to the town, where the fire reaching the guns which 
</p><p>
wore loaded, they went off, and shortly after their 
magazines blew up with great explosions, but happily did no damage. In the conflagration, eight or 
nine topsail vessels were consumed. Thus was a fleet 
that cost the Congress and this province some hundred 
thousand pounds, to their burning shame destroyed 
in a few hours. 
</p><p>
" It is with the greatest satisfaction the printer con 
gratulates his fellow citizens upon the happy fulfilment 
of his hopes express'd in one of his former papers, 
that we sh'd shortly have the fleet lying before this 
city and upon the happy renewal of business. 
Nothing can afford every well- wisher to the prosperity 
of this province greater joy than the present pleasing 
view of our wharfs crowded with vessels and merchandise of every kind. 
</p><p>
" Saturday morning last about 7 o clock a pretty 
smart shock of an earthquake was felt in this city. 
It is about 14 years since any thing of an earthquake 
has been felt here before. 
</p><p>
" "Whereas, notwithstanding the general agreement 
of the inhabitants of this city That such legal paper 
money as has been emitted by acts of assembly, and 
received the royal sanction, should be received in all 
payments, and deemed of equal value with gold and 
silver at the old customary rates, in the said agreement specified sundry persons lately arrived in this 
city, and even some who have signed the said agreement, do now refuse to take the said paper money 
and make a difference in the prices if they can be paid 
in gold and silver thereby taking an injust advantage of the necessity of the times, striving to embarrass 
the public affairs, to destroy the chief medium of 
our commerce and prevent the negotiating bills of 
exchange. "We therefore to discourage practices so 
selfish and injurious to the public, do hereby engage to 
each other and the public upon our honor that we 
will not directly or indirectly deal with any person or 
persons whatsoever who shall refuse to take the said 
paper money in their payments, or make any difference 
between the value thereof and gold and silver as fixed 
in the said agreement nor will we deal with any 
person or persons who shall be known to engross any 
quantity of provisions, with a view to retail the same 
at an immoderate price to the distress of the poor and 
industrious housekeepers. The above association is 
now signing by the Inhabitants at the Coffee House. 
</p><p>
AYe have just received intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> and the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De La Fayette</a> that Morgan's 
Corps with two pickets of militia, under the command 
of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De La Fayette</a> attacked the Hessian 
Picket consisting of 300 men, kill'd 20, wounded about 
as many and took 14 prisoners the picket was twice 
reinforced by British night came on, and the Americans masters of the field march'd slowly to their 
camp, having lost only two men kill'd and three or four 
wounded. 
</p><p>
I have barely time to close with those expressions of duty and affection which it always gives me pleasure to repeat.
