Thursday Eve. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>, 19 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1764">1764</a>. 
WHY, my good man, thou hast the curiosity of a girl. 
Who could have believed, that only a slight hint 
would have set thy imagination agog in such a man 
ner. And a fine encouragement I have to unravel 
the mystery as thou callest it. Nothing less, truly, 
than to be told something to my disadvantage. What 
an excellent reward that will be ! In what court of 
justice didst thou learn that equity? I thank thee, 
friend ; such knowledge as that is easy enough to be 
obtained without paying for it. As to the insinuation, it doth not give me any uneasiness ; for, if it is 
any thing very bad, I know thou dost not believe it. 
I am net conscious of any harm that I have done or 
wished to any mortal. I bear no malice to any 
being. To my enemies, if any I have, I am willing 
to afford assistance ; therefore towards man I maintain a conscience void of offence. 
</p><p>
Yet by this I mean not that I am faultless. But 
tell me what is the reason, that persons would rather 
acknowledge themselves guilty than be accused by 
others? Is it because they are more tender of them 
selves, or because they meet with more favor from 
others when they ingenuously confess? Let that be 
as it will, there is something which makes it more 
agreeable to condemn ourselves than to be condemned by others. 
</p><p>
But, although it is vastly disagreeable to be accused of faults, yet no person ought to be offended 
when such accusations are delivered in the spirit of 
friendship. I now call upon you to fulfil your promise, and tell me all my faults both of omission and 
commission, and all the evil you either know or 
think of me. Be to me a second conscience, nor 
put me off to a more convenient season. There can 
be no time more proper than the present. It will be 
harder to erase them when habit has strengthened 
and confirmed them. Do not think I trifle. These 
are really meant as words of truth and soberness, 
For the present, good night.

Friday Morning, April 20th. 
</p><p>
What does it signify? Why may not I visit you 
days as well as nights? I no sooner close my eyes, 
than some invisible being, swift as the Alborack of 
Mahomet, bears me to you, I see you, but cannot 
make myself visible to you. That tortures me, but 
it is still worse when I do not come, for I am then 
haunted by half a dozen ugly sprites. One will 
catch me and leap into the sea ; another will carry 
me up a precipice like that which Edgar describes 
in Lear, then toss rne down, and, were I not then 
light as the gossamer, I should shiver into atoms ; 
another will be pouring down my throat stuff worse 
than the witches broth in Macbeth. Where I shall 
be carried next I know not, but I would rather have 
the smallpox by inoculation half a dozen times than 
be sprited about as I am. What say you? Can 
you give me any encouragement to come? By the 
time you receive this I hope from experience you 
will be able to say, that the distemper is but a trifle. 
Think you I would not endure a trifle for the pleasure of seeing you? Yes, were it ten times that 
trifle, I would. But my own inclinations must not 
be followed, to duty I sacrifice them. Yet, O my 
mamma, forgive me if I say, you have forgot or never knew but hush, and do you excuse me that something I promised you, since it was a speech 
more undutiful than that which I just now stopped 
myself in. For the present, good bye. 
 </p><p>
Friday Evening. 
</p><p>
I hope you smoke your letters well, before you 
deliver them. Mamma is so fearful lest I should 
catch the distemper, that she hardly ever thinks the 
letters are sufficiently purified. Did you never rob a 
bird's nest? Do you remember how the poor bird 
would fly round and round, fearful to come nigh, yet 
not know how to leave the place? Just so they say 
I hover round Tom, whilst he is smoking my letters. 
</p><p>
But heyday, Mr. What's your name, who taught 
you to threaten so vehemently? " A character be 
sides that of a critic, in which if I never did, I always 
hereafter shall fear you." Thou canst not prove a 
villain, impossible, I, therefore, still insist upon it, 
that I neither do nor can fear thee. For my part, I 
know not that there is any pleasure in being feared ; 
but, if there is, I hope you will be so generous as to 
fear your Diana, that she may at least be made sensible of the pleasure. Mr. Ayers will bring you this 
letter and the lag. Do not repine, it is filled with balm. 
</p><p>
Here is love, respects, regards, good wishes a 
whole wagon load of them, sent you from all the 
good folks in the neighbourhood. 
</p><p>
To-morrow makes the fourteenth day. How many 
more are to come? I dare not trust myself with 
the thought. Adieu. Let me hear from you by 
Mr. Ayers, and excuse this very bad writing ; if 
you had mended my pen it would have been better. 
Once more, adieu. Gold and silver have I none, but such as I have give I unto thee, which is the 
affectionate regard of your
