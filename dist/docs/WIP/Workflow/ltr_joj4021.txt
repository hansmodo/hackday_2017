Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the long and friendly letter of the 
14th inst. which I have had the pleasure of receiving from 
you. It was, for many reasons, grateful to me. I value 
the esteem and regard of the wise and virtuous ; and bad 
wished to know the particulars of transactions respecting 
which only vague and unsatisfactory reports had come to 
my knowledge. Delicacy forbade my breaking the subject 
to you when here. I was sure of your politeness, but not 
certain of more than a usual degree of confidence. The 
latter has now become manifest, and permit me to assure 
you it shall be mutual. The impression attempted to be 
made has not taken. It passed without a single remark. 
Your friends thought it merited nothing but silence and 
neglect. The same reason induced me to take no notice 
of it in my answer. 
</p><p>
I have perused the several papers with which you 
favoured me. The delicacy, candour, and temper diffused 
through your letters form a strong contrast to the evasions 
and design observable in some others. Gratitude ought to 
have attached a certain gentleman to the friend who raised 
him ; a spurious ambition, however, has, it seems, made 
him your enemy. This is not uncommon. To the dishonour of human nature, the history of mankind has many 
pages filled with similar instances ; and we have little reason to expect that the annals of the present or future times 
will present us with fewer characters of this class. On the 
contrary, there is reason to expect that they will multiply in 
the course of this revolution. Seasons of general heat, 
tumult, and fermentation favour the production and growth 
of some great virtues, and of many great and little vices. 
Which will predominate, is a question which events not 
yet produced nor now to be discerned can alone determine. 
What parties and factions will arise, to what objects be 
directed, what sacrifices they will require, and who will be 
the victims, are matters beyond the sphere of human prescience. New modes of government, not generally understood, nor in certain instances approved — want of moderation and information in the people — want of abilities and 
rectitude in some of their rulers — a wide field open for the 
operations of ambition — men raised from low degrees to 
high stations, and rendered giddy by elevation and the 
extent of their views — a revolution in private property 
and in national attachments — laws dictated by the spirit of 
the times, not the spirit of justice and liberal policy — latitude in principles as well as commerce — suspension of education — fluctuations in manners, and public counsels, and 
moral obligations — indifference to religion, &c. &c, are 
circumstances that portend evils which much prudence, 
vigour, and circumspection are necessary to prevent or 
control. To me, there appears reason to expect a long 
storm and difficult navigation. Calm repose and the sweets 
of undisturbed retirement appear more distant than a peace 
with Britain. It gives me pleasure, however, to reflect that 
the period is approaching when we shall become citizens of 
a better-ordered state ; and the spending a few troublesome 
years of our eternity in doing good to this and future generations is not to be avoided nor regretted. Things will 
come right, and these States will be great and flourishing. 
The dissolution of our government threw us into a political 
chaos. Time, wisdom, and perseverance will reduce it 
into form, and give it strength, order, and harmony. In 
this work you are, to speak in the style of one of your professions, a master-builder ; and God grant that you may 
long continue a free and accepted mason. 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear sir, I have indulged myself in thinking loud 
in your hearing ; it would be an Hibernicism to say in your 
sight, though in one sense true ; it is more than probable I 
shall frequently do the like. Your letter shall be my 
apology, and the pleasure resulting from the converse of 
those we esteem, the motive. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
With perfect esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
