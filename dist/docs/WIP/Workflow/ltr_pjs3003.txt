</p><p>
I thank you, my dear General, for your very kind 
and polite letter of the 28th ultimo, which I just had 
the honor to receive.
</p><p>
Immediately on my arrival here, I issued such orders 
respecting the provisions and stores, (which I found 
had been most scandalously embezzled or misapplied,) 
as I hoped would effectually have brought matters 
into a right train ; but it is the misfortune of the 
people here, that they do not know how to obey, 
although they should be willing. 
</p><p>
I have therefore directed the Deputy Commissary-General to send up a person, (whom I named and 
knew to be equal to the business,) to examine the 
Commissaries at the several posts on the communication, and to give them such directions as will, I 
hope, introduce regularity in future. Mr. John N. Bleeker is now employed in that essential business. 
</p><p>
With respect to the returns of the army, you will 
see, by the last letter I had the honor to write you, 
that I have had no success in getting them properly 
made, although I have drawn and given them forms, 
which I thought so clear that no possibility of mistaking them remained. 
</p><p>
I foresaw, my dear Sir, that you would have a 
Herculean labor, in order to introduce that proper 
spirit of discipline and subordination, which is the 
very soul of an army ; and I felt for you with the 
utmost sensibility, as I well knew the variety of 
difficulties you would have to encounter, and which 
must necessarily be extremely painful and disgusting  to you, accustomed to order and regularity. I 
can easily conceive, that my difficulties are only a 
faint semblance of yours. Yes, my General, I will 
strive to copy your bright example, and patiently 
and steadily persevere in that line, which only can 
promise the wished-for reformation. 
</p><p>
Since my last I have had a verbal confirmation, by 
one of my scouts, of the intelligence contained in the affidavits which I sent you. I am prepared, with the 
utmost diligence, to obey my orders and move against 
the enemy, unless your Excellency or Congress should 
direct otherwise. In the course of a few days I expect 
to receive the ultimate determination. Whatever it 
may be, I shall try to execute it in such a manner as 
will best promote the just cause in which we are engaged. 
</p><p>
Not a man from this Colony has yet joined me, 
except those I returned to you, and who were raised 
and paid by the Committee of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. Nor have I 
yet received those necessary supplies, which I begged 
the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Provincial Congress to send me as 
long ago as the 3d of last month, and which the 
Continental Congress had desired them to do. 
</p><p>
The troops here are destitute of tents. They are 
crowded in vile barracks, which, with the natural 
inattention of the soldiery to cleanliness, has already been productive of disease, and numbers are 
daily rendered unfit for duty. 
</p><p>
I am so unfortunate as not to have one carriage for 
field artillery, so that if I am ordered to attack St. 
John s, and am able to get down the Sorel River, I 
shall labor under vast difficulty to bring up the can 
non through a very swampy country. They will be 
few, indeed, as I shall have less than a ton of powder, when the troops are completed to twenty-four rounds a man. 
</p><p>
Congress has appointed Commissioners for Indian 
Affairs. As one of them, I have ordered messengers to be sent into their country, to invite them 
to a conference at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. I have also requested 
the Caghnawagas to meet me at this place. The 
whole family of the late Sir William Johnson have 
held a line of conduct, that evinces the most inimical 
sentiments to the American cause. Sir John John 
son has had four hundred men, partly Scotch High 
landers, in arms, to protect a scoundrel sheriff, who 
had repeatedly insulted the good inhabitants of that 
country, which at length they retaliated. The inhabitants have, however, drove off the sheriff, and 
made the knight promise he would interfere no further. I should not have hesitated one moment to 
have secured him and his adherents, had I not been 
apprehensive of evil consequences from the Indians. 
I therefore thought it most prudent to advise Congress of the whole matter. 
</p><p>
Although, Sir, I am much in want of men, and 
would wish to have the three New Hampshire companies, mentioned in the copy of your letter of the 
27th ultimo; yet they are so happily posted, either 
to awe the Missisque and St. Francois Indians, or to 
march to the relief of the inhabitants of this Colony, living to the westward of where these troops are 
now posted, on what are commonly called the New 
Hampshire Grants, that in case of an attack from the 
savages I have mentioned, who, if any, are most our 
enemies, I could wish them to remain under orders 
there for that purpose. 
</p><p>
I am extremely happy to learn that you are so well supplied with provisions. I have now a tolerable stock of flour, but very little pork. Fat cattle 
are, however, coming up, so that I do not apprehend we shall suffer in that article. 
</p><p>
My best wishes attend <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Reed</a></a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague met'>Major Mifflin</a></a>. I am, most respectfully, your Excellency's obedient 
</p><p>
Very humble servant,
