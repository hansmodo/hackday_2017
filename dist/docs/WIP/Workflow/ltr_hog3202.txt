SIR, 
</p><p>
I am this moment honored with the receipt of your Excellency's letter of to-day's date. 
</p><p>
I am sorry for the disgrace we have suffered in 
the Jerseys; but imagine that the enemy take ad 
vantage of the supine ness that constantly seizes our people, when they have been long unmolested. This 
is an evil, that even the best officers cannot remedy. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel=''>General McDougall</a>'s division will be put upon 
the march immediately, as your Excellency has commanded. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will excuse me when I say, I like 
not the divided state of your army. The enemy are 
upon the qui-vive ; they have the advantages of a 
river, to navigate upon each of our flanks. To divide is to conquer, in politics. I hope it may not, with 
regard to us, prove so in the war. 
</p><p>
I hope Lord Stirling and General Maxwell will answer all your Excellency's expectations in the Jerseys ; they certainly are best acquainted with that 
country. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a letter I have this moment received 
from Major Tallmadge. Your Excellency will please 
to order Colonel Pettit to supply the necessary articles. I am, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant,
