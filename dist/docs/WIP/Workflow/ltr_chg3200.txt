MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
I arrived here on Saturday last with my regiment. 
They were much fatigued with the march, as I forced 
thirty-five miles one day. They are now in high 
spirits, and go to their duty with the greatest cheerfulness. The inclosed return shows our strength. I 
have found it necessary to contract the fort, but it is too large for our numbers, as we have very little to expect from the militia. 
</p><p>
I saw General Newcomb last evening. He informs 
me that the small number now on duty expect to 
return home in a day or two ; those that relieve them 
expect to be relieved in three days. The General 
thinks your Excellency's intentions were, for the 
militia only to help complete the fort ; after that, to 
fall on the rear of the enemy, in case of an attack. 
Should we be attacked, they must be so scattered as 
to be able to give us little or no assistance. 
</p><p>
The strength of the navy, and of <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, your Excellency will have by the express who bears this, 
from the officers commanding them. They are certainly very weak for so important a post. I have 
already, and shall still give them all the assistance 
in my power. Could your Excellency give us the 
assistance of Colonel Angell's regiment, I doubt not 
this post would be secure, without dependence on 
militia. If they are to be relieved in the manner I 
understand they are, it is my opinion they will do 
us no service. General Newcomb gives very little 
encouragement of any to supply the place of those 
that are going off the ground. Could we be reenforced, we probably might frustrate the enemy's designs in three batteries they are erecting against 
<a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, and so near as to do much injury when 
opened. 
</p><p>
I find it necessary, for the security of the post, to 
keep my men all on fatigue daily. This I doubt will 
cause them to be less spirited in action, if I should 
be under the necessity to continue it, which must be 
the case, unless I am reenforced. The post I have in 
charge I am determined to defend, with the small 
number I command, to the last extremity ; yet I 
doubt my number is much too small to answer your Excellency's expectations. I am, with the greatest 
respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
