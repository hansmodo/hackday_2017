Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Mr Morris's letters of the 4th and 5th of June last, on 
politics and business, I received with the duplicates of my 
commission, and instructions on the 25th ult. I stand 
corrected and confine myself to politics. 
</p><p>
Your letter found me in a most critical situation ; the 
Ministry had become extremely uneasy at your absolute 
silence ; and the bold assertions of the British Ambassador, 
that you were accommodating matters, aided by the black 
and villainous artifices of one or two of our own countrymen 
here, had brought them to apprehend, not only a settlement 
between the two countries, but the most serious consequences 
to their West India Islands, should we unite again with Great 
Britain. For me, alas ! I had nothing left but to make the 
most positive assertions, that no accommodation would or 
could take place, and to pledge myself in the strongest possible manner, that thus would turn out the event, yet so 
strong were their apprehensions, that an order was issued to 
suspend furnishing me with stores. Think what I must feel 
upon such an occasion. Our friend, M. Beaumarchais, 
exerted himself, and in a day or two obtained the orders to 
be countermanded, and every thing is again running on favorably. For heaven's sake, if you moan to have any connexion with this kingdom, be more assiduous in getting your 
letters here. I know not where the blame lies, but it must lie heavy somewhere, when vessels are suffered to sail from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and other ports quite down to the middle of August, without a single line. This circumstance was urged 
against my assertions, and was near proving a mortal stab to 
my whole proceedings. One Mr Hopkins, of Maryland, in 
this service, and who is in the rank of Brigadier General, appeared desirous of going to America, but on my not paying 
him the regard he vainly thought himself entitled to, he 
formed the dark design of defeating at one stroke ray whole 
prospects as to supplies. At this critical period he pretended 
to be in my secrets, and roundly asserted that I had solely 
in view a reconciliation with Great Britain, immediately 
after which the stores now furnishing would be used against 
France. This coming from a professed enemy of Great 
Britain, from a native of America, from one who professed 
himself a zealous friend to the Colonies, you must suppose 
had weight. However thunderstruck I was, as well as my 
friend, M. Beaumarchais, at this unexpected and last effort 
of treachery, we exerted ourselves, and truth prevailed. 
The mischief has recoiled on himself, and having fallen into 
disgrace here, he will strive to get to America, where he 
threatens, I hear, to do much mischief to me. However, 
he will not probably be permitted to depart, unless he slips 
off very privately. Should that be the case, or should he 
write letters, you have now a clue to unravel him and his 
proceedings. 
</p><p>
It would be too tedious to recount what I have met with 
in this way. It has not only confined me to Paris, but to my 
chamber and pen for some weeks past in drawing up by 
way of memorial, the true state of the Colonies, their interests, the system of policy they must unquestionably pursue, 
and showing that the highest interests of France are inseparably connected therewith. I do not mention a single difficulty with one complaining thought for myself; my all is 
devoted, and I am happy in being so far successful, and that 
the machinations of my enemies, or rather the enemies of my 
country, have given me finally an opportunity of experiencing die friendship and protection of great and valuable men ; 
but it is necessary that you should know as much as possible 
of my situation. The stores are collecting, and I hope will 
be embarked by the middle of this month ; if later, I shall 
incline to send them by Martinique, on account of the season. 
It is consistent with a political letter to urge the remittance 
of the fourteen thousand hogsheads of tobacco written for 
formerly, in part payment of these stores ; if you make it 
twenty, the public will be the gainers, as the article is rising 
fast. You are desired by no means to forget Bermuda ; if 
you should. Great Britain will seize it this winter, or France 
on the first rupture, having been made sensible of its importance, by the officious zeal of that same JMr H. As your 
navy is increasing, will you commission me to send you 
duck for twenty or thirty sail ? I can procure it for you to 
the northward on very good terms, and you have on hand the produce wanted to pay for it with. Have you granted 
commissions against the Portuguese ? All the friends to America in Europe call loudly for such a measure. 
</p><p>
Would you have universal commerce, commission some 
person to visit every kingdom on the Continent, that can 
hold any commerce with America. Among them by no 
means forget Prussia. Grain will be in demand in this 
kingdom, and in the south of Europe. Permit me again to 
urge an increase of the navy. Great Britain is calling in 
her Mediterranean passes, to expose us to the Algerines. I 
propose applying to this Court on that subject. Doctor Bancroft, of London, merits much of the Colonies. As I shall 
now have frequent opportunities of writing by officers and others going out, I will not add more, than that Mr Carmichael has now been with me some time, recommended by 
Mr A. Lee, of London. I owe much to him for his assistance in my despatches, and for his friendly and seasonable 
advice upon all occasions. He is of Maryland, and is here 
for his health, and proposes going soon to America. I expect to hear from London tomorrow by Dr B. who is on 
his way here. 
</p><p>
I am, with my most sincere respect and esteem for the 
Secret Committee, and most profound regard to the Congress, your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. An agent from Barbadoes is arrived in London to 
represent their distresses ; another from Bermuda with a 
declaration to the Ministry of the necessity of their being 
supplied with provisions from the Colonies, and saying that if not permitted they must ask the protection of 
Congress. 
</p><p>
I have to urge your sending to me, either a general power 
for the purpose, or a number of blank commissions for vessels 
of war. It is an object of the last importance, for in this time 
of peace between the nations of Europe, I can be acquainted 
with the time of every vessel's sailing, either from England or 
Portugal, and by despatching light vessels armed from 
hence, and to appearance property o{ the citizens of the 
United States of America, to seize them while unsuspicious 
on this coast, and to stand directly for America with them, 
great reprisals may be made ; and persons of the first property have already solicited me on the occasion. Indeed 
they have such an opinion of my power, that they have 
offered to engage in such an adventure, if I would authorise 
them with my name ; but this might as yet be rather dangerous ; it is certainly however a very practicable and safe plan 
to arm a ship here, as if for the coast of Africa or the West 
Indies, wait until some ship of value is sailing from England 
or Portugal, slip out at once and carry them on to America. 
When arrived the armed vessel increases your navy, and the 
prize supplies the country. 
</p><p>
It is of importance, as I have mentioned in my former letters, to have some one deputed and empowered to treat with 
the king of Prussia. I am acquainted with his agent here, and have already through him received some queries and 
proposals respecting American commerce, to which I am preparing a reply. I have also an acquaintance with the 
Agent of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who proposes fixing a commerce between the United States and Leghorn, but 
has not as yet given me his particular thoughts. France and Spain are naturally our allies; the Italian states want our flour and some other articles; Prussia, ever pursuing her own 
interests, needs but be informed of some facts relative to America's increasing commerce, to favor us ; Holland will 
pursue its system now fixed, of never quarreling with any one on any occasion whatever. In this view is seen at once the 
power we ought to apply to, and gain a good acquaintance with. Let me again urge you on the subject of tobacco. 
Receive also from me another hint. It is this ; if you would apportion a certain tract of the Western Lands, to be divided 
at the close of this war among the officers and soldiers serving in it, and make a generous allotment, it would I 
think have a good effect in America, as the poorest soldiers would then be fighting literally for a freehold; and in 
Europe it would operate beyond any pecuniary offers. I have no time to enlarge on the thought, but may take it up 
hereafter ; if I do not, it is an obvious one, and if capable of execution, you can manage it to the best advantage. 
</p><p>
I have no doubt but I can obtain a loan for the Colonies, if empowered, and on very favorable terms. I have 
already sounded on the subject, and will be more explicit hereafter, both as to my proposals, for I can go no further, 
and the answers I may receive.
