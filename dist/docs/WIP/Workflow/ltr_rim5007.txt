MY DEAR JANET: 
</p><p>
This day I had the pleasure of yours of the 13th of October. I think your letters are a long time on the road. I believe I 
have now the right to complain, as I am sure you, don't write so often as I do. 
</p><p>
I suppose long ere this we have furnished the folks of the United Colonies with subject-matter of conversation. I should 
like to see the long faces of my Tory friends. I fancy they look a little cast down, and that the Whig ladies triumph most unmercifully. 
</p><p>
The weather continues so gentle that we have been able, at this late season, to get down by water with our artillery, &c. 
They sire a good deal alarmed in town, and with some reason. The garrison is little to be depended upon, and very weak in proportion to the extent of the works. I wish it were well over 
with all my heart, and sigh for home like a New Englander. 
</p><p>
I shan't forget your beaver blanket if I get safe out of this affair, nor your mother's martin-skins. Present my affectionate 
duty to her, and make her easy respecting Harry. He has by no means given me any offence, though some uneasiness by 
some little imprudences. I am glad to hear your house is in such forwardness. May I have the pleasure of seeing you in it soon ! 
</p><p>
Till then, adieu! 
</p><p>
Believe me affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
