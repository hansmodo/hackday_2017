MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
You ask in one of your letters to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>, " What is become of <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='me'>Mrs. Adams</a>, that I do not hear from her ? " 
</p><p>
If my heart had not done you more justice than 
my pen, I would disown it. I have so long omitted 
writing to you, that my conscience has been a very 
severe accuser of me. But, be assured, my dear 
Sir, that I never fail to talk of you with pleasure, and 
think of you with affection. I place the hours spent 
at the Hyde amongst some of the most pleasurable 
of my days, and I esteem your friendship as one of 
the most valuable acquisitions that I made in your 
country ; a country that I should most sincerely rejoice to visit again, if I could do it without crossing 
the ocean. 1 have sometimes been suspected of 
partiality, for the preference which I have given to 
England ; and, were I to live out of America, that 
country would have been my choice. 
</p><p>
I have a situation here, which, for natural beauty 
may vie with the most delicious spot I ever saw. It 
is a mile and a half distant from the city of New 
Y'ork. The house is situated upon an.eminence ; at an agreeable distance flows the noble Hudson, bearing upon its bosom the fruitful productions of the 
adjacent country. On my right hand, are fields 
beautifully variegated with grass and grain, to a great 
extent, like the valley of Honiton in Devonshire. 
Upon my left, the city opens to view, intercepted, 
here and there, by a rising ground, and an ancient 
oak. In front, beyond the Hudson, the Jersey shores 
present the exuberance of a rich, well-cultivated 
soil. The venerable oaks and broken ground, covered with wild shrubs, which surround me, give a 
natural beauty to the spot, which is truly enchanting. 
A lovely variety of birds serenade me morning and 
evening, rejoicing in their liberty and security ; for I 
have, as much as possible, prohibited the grounds 
from invasion, and sometimes almost wished for 
game laws, when my orders have not been sufficiently regarded. The partridge, the woodcock, and the 
pigeon are too great temptations to the sportsmen to 
withstand. How greatly would it add to my happiness to welcome here my much esteemed friend. 
'Tis true, we have a large portion of the blue and 
gold, of which you used to remind me, when you 
thought me an Egyptian ; but, however I might 
hanker after the good things of America, I have 
been sufficiently taught to value and esteem other 
countries besides my own. 
</p><p>
You were pleased to inform us, that your adopted 
family ' flourished in your soil ; mine has received an addition. Mrs. Smith, <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s daughter, and 
the wife of Colonel W. Stephens Smith, respecting 
the name of the great literary benefactor of her 
native state, and in grateful remembrance of the 
friendly attention and patriotic character of its present possessor, has named his new-born son Thomas 
Hollis. She desires me to present you her affectionate remembrance. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> is absent upon 
a journey, or he would have written you a letter of a later date than that which Mr. Knox is 
the bearer of. This gentleman is a brother of 
our Secretary of War, and is appointed consul to 
Dublin. He is intelligent, and can answer you any 
question respecting our government and politics, 
which you may wish to ask ; but, if he should not 
see you, I know it will give you pleasure to learn 
that our union is complete, by the accession of Rhode 
Island ; that our government acquires strength, confidence, and stability daily ; that peace is in our 
borders, and plenty in our dwellings ; and we earnestly pray, that the kindling flames of war, which 
appear to be bursting out in Europe, may by no 
means be extended to this rising nation. We enjoy 
freedom in as great a latitude as is consistent with 
our security and happiness. God grant that we may 
rightly estimate our blessings. 
</p><p>
Pray remember me, in the most affectionate terms, 
to Dr. Price and to Mrs. Jebb ; and be assured, my 
dear sir, that I am, with every sentiment of regard 
and esteem, Yours, &c, 
</p><p>
Abigail Adams.
