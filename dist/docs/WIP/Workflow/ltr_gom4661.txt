Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have now the honor to transmit the copy of the decision 
made by the municipality of Dunkirk, on the third instant, respecting the ship Fame, which I received last night, in a letter 
from that place, of the seventh, which informs mo that the 
ship had then sailed. 
</p><p>
I have just now written to <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, (who, by the bye, is 
en etat d arrestation) a letter of acknowledgment, a copy of 
which is enclosed. I did this the more readily, because I 
shall have new complaints to make, in all human probability, 
for in the best regulated governments it is difficult to prevent 
the violation of the rights of neutral powers, and much more 
so, where, in the tempest of a revolution, government resem-bles more a weathercock, marking from whence the hurricane 
comes, than a tower to resist its force. Whenever a good 
opportunity presents itself, I shall take the liberty to hazard 
my opinion on the late events, for I cannot say revolution, be 
cause it is not quite determined whether that shall be the con 
ventional appellation of what passed in the end of May. I 
am, &c.
