Sir, 
</p><p>
In my despatches of the 29th ultimo, I did myself 
the honor to acquaint your Excellency with the disposition I had made to counteract the movements of 
the enemy, and to protect the country from their depredations. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis continued at Weymsborough, making every preparation, and completely equipping his 
troops for the most active operations, until the 9th 
instant ; when, having been joined by the troops under General Leslie, he put his army in motion, and 
advanced as far as the Cross Roads, on the west side 
of the Catawba river, and about forty miles from Camden. The position which Brigadier- General Morgan 
occupies, was well chosen for harassing the left flank, 
and checking the progress of the enemy on the route 
they had taken for the execution of their plan of 
operations. This, I suppose, induced his Lordship, on 
the 11th, to detach Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton to dislodge him, and disperse the few militia who were 
collecting. 
</p><p>
I have the satisfaction to transmit your Excellency 
a copy of a letter which I this moment received from 
Brigadier-General Morgan, announcing the total defeat 
of Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton's detachment. The victory was complete, and the action glorious. The brilliancy and success with which it was fought does the 
highest honor to the American arms, and adds splendor to the character of the General and his officers. 
I must beg leave to recommend them to your Excellency's notice, and doubt not, but from your representation, Congress ill receive pleasure from testifying their approbation of their conduct. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Pickens</a> was left on the ground, to relieve 
the wounded and to cover that part of the country. 
I am unhappy that the distressed situation of this 
army will not admit of our improving the advantage 
we have gained. But I hope it has given the enemy 
a check that will prevent their advancing for some 
days. Our supplies of provisions are growing more 
precarious ; and the other stores, which I can only 
look for from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, do not arrive in such 
quantities as to replace those which are daily destroyed in service, I have appointed Major Hyrne, 
Deputy Commissary-General of Prisoners for the 
Southern department, and ordered him to send all the 
prisoners of war to Virginia, The militia, under General Stephens, will take charge of them, as their time 
of service has already expired. 
</p><p>
I have directed Major-General the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron De Steuben</a> to transmit to Congress and to your Excellency, 
regular reports of the operations in Virginia. I do 
myself the honor to inclose a copy of my letter to 
Congress respecting the action of the 17th instant. 
I am. with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and 
respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
