Sir, 
</p><p>
In my last despatches, of the 7th instant, I informed your Excellency of my arrival at camp, and of 
the condition and situation of the army. I was apprehensive, on my first arrival, that the country 
around Charlotte was too much exhausted to afford 
subsistence for the army at that place for any considerable time. Upon a little further inquiry, I was 
fully convinced, and immediately despatched Colonel 
Kosciuszko, to look out a position on the Pedee, 
that would afford a healthy camp and provisions in 
plenty. His report was favorable, and I immediately 
put the army under marching orders ; but the excessive rains, which continued eleven days, prevented our 
marching till the 20th instant. We arrived here the 
26th, having performed the march with incredible 
difficulty, through a barren country, with wagons and 
horses altogether unfit for service. The probability 
that my taking this position would discourage the 
enemy from attempting to possess themselves of Cross 
Creek, which would have given them command of the 
greatest part of the provisions in the lower country, 
was another inducement to come to this place. It is 
also a camp of repose ; and no army ever wanted one 
more, the troops having totally lost their discipline. 
</p><p>
Before I left Charlotte, I detached three hundred 
of our best troops, and Lieutenant-Colonel Washington's regiment of light dragoons, under the command 
of General Morgan, with orders to take a position on 
the south side of the Catawba, near the fork of Broad 
River, where he was to be joined by three hundred 
volunteers, under General Davidson, and four or five 
hundred South Carolina and Georgia militia, under 
the command of Colonel Clark and Colonel Few. 
With this party, he is either to act upon the offensive or defensive, as occasion may warrant. This 
will straiten the enemy in their limits, and prevent 
their drawing supplies from the upper country. It 
will also give spirits to the inhabitants of that quarter, and enable them to form a number of small magazines in the rear of the troops (which General JNIorgan has particularly in charge), that we may have 
something; to subsist on should we be able to advance 
hereafter in force. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis continues in the same position that 
he was when I wrote before, and General Leslie arrived off <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> Bar the 14th ; but whether he 
has landed any of his troops, I am not informed. 
The troops, mentioned to have arrived in my former 
letter, were only some recruits that came in with provision vessels, not exceeding four or five hundred men. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> left The army the 10th, and General Smallwood the 19th instant. The latter is gone to 
Maryland, with a view of forwarding the troops and 
supplies from that State, and to settle the matter 
with Congress respecting his right of promotion, beins determined not to submit to the command of the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron De Steuben</a>, who is still in Virginia, very usefully employed in forming, and forwarding the troops 
from that State. 
</p><p>
I have been obliged to send Major Nelson's corps 
of horse and Colonel Armand's legion to Virginia, 
both being unfit for duty, for want of clothing and 
other equipments ; and the difficulty of subsisting 
them is much greater here than there. Before my 
arrival. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> made an attempt to employ 
part of Colonel Armand's legion, and fifteen of them 
deserted on the march from Hillsborough to Charlotte, which obliged him to recall them. I wish your 
Excellency's directions respecting this corps, as they 
are totally deranged, and cannot be fit for service for 
some time. 
</p><p>
Two slight skirmishes have been fought with the enemy, since my last, one by a party under <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Marion</a>, upon the Santee, and the other by Colonel Few, near Ninety Six. About twenty or thirty were killed and wounded on each side. 
</p><p>
I will not pain your Excellency with further accounts of the wants and sufferings of this army ; but I am not without great apprehension of its entire 
dissolution, unless the Commissary's and Quarter-master's departments can be rendered more competent to the demands of the service. Nor are the Clothing 
and Hospital departments upon a better footing. Not a shilling in the pay-chest nor a prospect of any for months to come. This is really making bricks 
without straw. I am, &c.,

P. S. This moment accounts have been received 
that General Leslie landed his troops at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> 
on the 21st instant, and, on the 24th, was at Monk's 
Corner, on his way to Nelson's Ferry.

The Cherokee Indians have murdered a number of 
the inhabitants on the frontiers of North Carolina. It 
is said the militia have marched against their lower 
towns.
