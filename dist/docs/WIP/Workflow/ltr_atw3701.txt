Dear General, 
In pursuance of the plan, which your Excellency 
was pleased to adopt, the first and second Pennsylvania brigades, with four pieces of artillery belonging 
to Colonel Proctor's regiment, and Colonel Moylan's 
dragoons, took up their line of march on the 20th, at 
three o'clock, P. M., and arrived, a little in the rear 
of New Bridge, at nine in the evening. We moved again at one in the morning, in order to occupy the 
ground in the vicinity of <a href='/results.php?city=fort lee' rel='city'>Fort Lee</a> and the Landing 
opposite King's Bridge, by the dawn of the day; and, 
agreeably to the inclosed order, we advanced towards 
Bull's Ferry, â€” <a href='/results.php?tla=wli' rel='colleague met'>General Irvine</a>, with part of his brigade, along the summit of the mountain, and the 
first brigade, under Colonel Humpton, with the artillery and Colonel Moylan's horse, on the common 
road. About ten o'clock, part of the first brigade 
had reached that place. Colonel Moylan, with the 
horse, and a detachment of infantry, remained at the 
fork of the road leading to Paulus Hook and Bergen, 
to receive the enemy, if they attempted any thing 
from that quarter. 
</p><p>
On reconnoitring the refugee post, near Bull's 
Ferry, we found it to consist of a block-house, surrounded by an abatis and stockade to the perpendicular rocks next to the North River, with a kind of 
ditch, or parapet, serving as a covered way. By this 
time we could discover the enemy in motion on 
York Island, which began to open a prospect of our 
plan taking full effect. <a href='/results.php?tla=wli' rel='colleague met'>General Irvine</a> was directed 
to halt in a position from which he could move to 
any point where the enemy should attempt to land, 
either in the vicinity of this post or <a href='/results.php?city=fort lee' rel='city'>Fort Lee</a>, where 
the sixth and seventh regiments were previously concealed, with orders to wait the landing of the enemy, 
and then, at the point of the bayonet, to dispute the 
pass in the gorge of the mountain, at every expense 
of blood, until supported by <a href='/results.php?tla=wli' rel='colleague met'>General Irvine</a>, and the 
remainder of the troops. 
</p><p>
The first regiment was posted in a hollow way, on 
the north side of the block-house, and the tenth in 
another hollow on the south, with orders to keep up a 
constant fire into the portholes, to favor the advance of the artillery, which was covered by the second 
regiment. When the field-pieces arrived at the medium distance of sixty yards, they commenced a constant fire, which was returned by the enemy, and 
continued without intermission from eleven until after 
twelve o'clock. By that time we had expresses that 
the enemy were embarking their troops from Voluntine's Hill, at Phillips's Landing. We also saw many 
vessels and boats moving up with troops from New 
York, which made it necessary to relinquish a lesser 
for a much greater object; that is, drawing the enemy 
over towards the posts already mentioned, and deciding the fortune of the day in the defiles, through 
which they must pass before they could gain possession of the strong grounds. 
</p><p>
In the interim we found that our artillery had 
made but little impression, although well and gallantly served, the metal not being of sufficient weight 
to traverse the logs of the block-house ; but, when the 
troops understood that they were to be drawn off, 
such was the enthusiastic bravery of all ranks of officers and men, that the first regiment, no longer capable of restraint, rather than leave a post in the 
rear, rushed with impetuosity over the ahatis, and advanced to the stockades, from wliich they were with 
difficulty withdrawn, although they had no means of 
forcing an entry. The contagion spread to the second; but, by very great efforts of the officers of 
both regiments, they were at last restrained, not 
without the loss of some gallant officers wounded 
and some brave men killed. Happy it was that the 
ground would not admit of the further advance of 
the tenth regiment, and that the situation of <a href='/results.php?tla=wli' rel='colleague met'>General Irvine</a>'s brigade prevented them from experiencing a 
loss proportioned to those immediately engaged (as 
the same gallant spirit pervaded the whole), which 
might he a means of frustrating our main object, 
by incumbering us with too many wounded. 
</p><p>
The artillery was, therefore, drawn off, and forwarded towards the wished-for point of action. The 
killed and wounded were all moved away, except 
three, that lay dead under the stockades. During this 
period. Colonel Moylan's horse drove the cattle, &c., 
from Bergen up towards the Liberty Pole, whilst 
a detachment of infantry destroyed the sloops and 
wood-boats at the landing, in which were taken a 
Captain and mate, with two sailors. Some others 
were killed whilst attempting to escape by swimming. Having thus effected part of our plan, we 
pushed forward to oppose the troops from Valentine's 
Hill that we expected to land at the nearest point 
to New Bridge. If effected, we were determined to 
drive them back, or to cut our way through; but 
in this project we were disappointed; the enemy 
thought proper to remain in a less hostile position 
than that of the Jersey shore. We therefore passed 
the New Bridge, and, by easy degrees, returned to 
this place about an hour ago. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a copy of the orders of the 20th, together with a return of the killed and wounded, 
sixty-four in number, among whom are Lieutenants 
Hammond and Crawford, of the first, and Lieutenant Dehart of the second, all very worthy officers; the 
latter, mortally wounded. 
</p><p>
I cannot attempt to discriminate between officers, 
regiments, or corps, who, with equal opportunity, 
would have acted with equal fortitude. Should my 
conduct, and that of the troops under my command, 
meet your Excellency's approbation, it will much 
alleviate the pain I experience in not having it in my power to carry The whole of the plan into execution, which was only prevented by the most malicious fortune. I have the honor to be, with sincere 
esteem, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant,
