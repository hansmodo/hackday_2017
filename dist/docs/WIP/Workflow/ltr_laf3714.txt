My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
You have so often been pleased to ask I would 
give my opinion upon any subject that may occur, 
that I will this day take the liberty to mention a few 
articles. I am far from laughing at the idea of the 
enemy's making a retreat. It is not very probable ; 
but it is not impossible. Indeed, they have no other 
way to escape, and since we cannot get ships above 
York, I should be still more afraid of a retreat by 
"<a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, than any thing else. The French hussars remaining here, our dragoons and some infantry might be stationed somewhere near <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, rather on the north side. I see the service is much 
done by details, and, to use your permission, I would 
take the liberty to observe, that when the siege is 
once begun it might be more agreeable to the officers 
and men to serve, as much as possible, by whole battalions. 
</p><p>
Colonel Scammell is taken. His absence I had accounted for by his being officer of the day. I am 
very sorry we lose a valuable officer ; but though 
Colonel Scammell's being officer of the day has been 
a reason for his going in front, I think it would be 
well to prevent the officers under the rank of Generals or Field-Officers reconnoitring, for the safety of 
their commands, from advancing so near the enemy's 
lines. There is a great disproportion between Huntington's and Hamilton's battalions. Now that Scammell is taken, we might have them made equal, and 
put the eldest of the two Lieutenant-Colonels on the 
right of the brigade. 
</p><p>
I have, these past days, wished for an opportunity 
to speak with your Excellency on Count de Grasse's 
demand relative to M. de Barras's fleet. This business being soon done, we may think of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
at least of the harbour; or of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. I have 
long and seriously thought of this matter ; but would 
not be in a hurry to mention it, until we know how 
long this will last. However, it might be possible to 
give Count de Grasse an early hint of it, in case 
you agree with him upon the winter departure of the 
whole fleet for the West Indies. 
</p><p>
One of my reasons to wish troops, though not in 
great numbers, to be sent to Gloucester county, by 
way of <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, is, that for the first days it will 
embarrass any movement of the enemy up the river, 
or up the country, on either side; and when it is in Gloucester county it may be thought advantageous, 
by a respectable regular force, to prevent the enemy's increasing their works there, and giving us the 
trouble of a second operation; and, at the same time, 
it will keep from York a part of the British forces. 
With the highest regard and most sincere affection, 
I have the honor to be, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
