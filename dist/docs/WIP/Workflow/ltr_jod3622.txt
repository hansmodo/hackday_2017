MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I COVET the harp of Amphion. What would I not 
give for the harp of Amphion ? 
</p><p>
In my walks in the cedar grove, in rocky run, and 
on Penn's hill, I should play upon my lyre, and the 
merry rocks would dance after me and reel into 
walls. This would be to me a very pleasant and 
profitable private amusement. But there is another 
use I could make of my instrument in my public 
employment, more grateful to a benevolent heart 
because more useful to mankind. In no age of the 
world was it more wanted. 
</p><p>
" Amphion thus bade wild dissension cease, 
And softened mortals learned the arts of peace. 
Amphion taught contending kings 
From various discords to create 
The music of a well tuned state ; 
</p><p>
Nor slack nor strain the tender strings 
Those useful touches to impart 
That strike the subject's answering heart, 
And the soft, silent harmony that springs 
From sacred union and consent of things." 
</p><p>
Alas ! I am not an Amphion. I have been thirty 
years singing and whistling among rny rocks, and not 
one would ever move without money. I have been 
twenty years saying if not singing, preaching if not 
playing 
</p><p>
" From various discords to create 
The music of a well tuned state ; 
And the soft, silent harmony that springs 
From sacred union and consent of things," 
</p><p>
but an uncomplying world will not regard my uncouth discourses. I cannot sing nor play. If I had 
eloquence, or humor, or irony, or satire, or the harp 
or lyre of Amphion, how much good could I do to the 
world ! What a mortification to my vanity ! What 
a humiliation to my self-love ! 
</p><p>
The rocks in the House of Representatives will not 
dance to my lyre. They will not accord to a " well 
tuned state." They will not endure " the harmony 
that springs from sacred union and consent of things." 
They are for breaking all the instruments hut that of 
the thorough bass, and then blowing you deaf and 
dumb. There are bold and daring strides making to 
demolish the President, Senate, and all but the House, 
which, as it seems to me, must be the effect of the 
measures that many are urging. Be not alarmed, 
however, they will not carry their point. The treaty 
will be executed, and that by the consent of the 
House. 
</p><p>
I am going to hear Dr. Priestley. His discourses 
are learned, ingenious, and useful. They will be 
printed, and, he says, dedicated to me. Don t tell 
this secret though, for no other being knows it. It 
will get me the character of a heretic, I fear. I presume, however, that dedicating a book to a man will 
not imply that he approves every thing in it. 
</p><p>
The weather is so fine that I long to be upon my 
hills. Pray, since my harp cannot build walls, how 
do my friends go on who are obliged to employ their 
elbows in that laborious work ? 
</p><p>
I sometimes think that if I were in the House of 
Representatives, and could make speeches there, I 
could throw some light upon these things. If <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> should be President, I believe I must put up 
as a candidate for the House. But this is my vanity. 
I feel sometimes as if I could speechify among them, 
but, alas, alas ! I am too old. It would soon destroy 
my health. I declare, however, if I were in that 
House, I would drive out of it some demons that 
haunt it. There are false doctrines and false jealousies predominant there at times that it would be 
easy to exorcise. 
</p><p>
You see I mind no order in what I write to you. I 
know your criticism will not be cruel to
