SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours of the 25th came to hand. I wrote you yesterday. It would 
be capital to take these Tories gone to town; about the mouth of Waccamaw will do it I approve much of your sending Capt. Matthews 
in Santee. I am glad to hear the galley is got up. She must be fitted 
and manned for service as soon as possible, and stationed in the conflux 
of Waccamaw, Pee Dee and Sampit Rivers. I enclosed you brevets 
for Capt. Milligan and two lieutenants. The armed schooner will be a 
great addition to our strength and security at your post. All the sails 
and rigging, &c., belonging to the schooner Three Friends, must be to 
fit up the galley. The hulk, sell or dispose to the best advantage for 
the State. I dislike Col. Senff's plan of fortifying <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. I 
shall visit it soon, and probably throw it wholly aside. I am sorry to 
see you have so few men, but I refer you to my last letter. I will ac 
quaint the General and Governor respecting Capt. Putnam's vessel. 
The powder and lead from Capt. Putnam is seasonable. Let me know 
everything you learn of the Tories movements and preparations, and 
take steps to know it by sending proper persons amongst them for the 
purpose. I believe your danger, if any, will be by water and Pee Dee 
I am, your obedient servant,
