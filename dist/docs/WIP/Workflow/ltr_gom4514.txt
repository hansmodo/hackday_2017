Dear General, 
</p><p>
The conduct, which the enemy may pursue, with relation 
to us, is not quite decided. But I have not a doubt, that their efforts during the next campaign will be chiefly towards our 
frontiers, with a view to weary us into submission. At the same time they will perhaps endeavor to keep such posts in 
our country, as to render the communications tedious, difficult, and expensive. My ideas as to our power of carrying on the 
war differ in some respects from those, whose opinions I respect. The .resources of the country may be drawn forth by 
our paper, at the same time it must be confessed, that this paper will thereby be less valuable. After all, the debt does not 
increase, for a certain sterling sum, which would have paid it 
one year ago, will pay it now. The depreciation in the interim has operated as a tax. 
</p><p>
I very sincerely lament, that this tax has fallen heavy on 
those, who have served and continue to serve their country. 
It is a peculiar hardship upon us, that fully to relieve the evils 
they labor under is not in our power. This leads me to the 
petition you mention, or representation, which I have not yet 
seen, and never wish to see. I cannot easily express to you how much I was hurt at being informed of it. Not indeed as 
to the matter, for that I really am a stranger to, but as to the manner in which it was procured. For, in the first place, it 
gave my enemies, (who were such in some degree for my earnest support of the claims of the army heretofore,) no small 
cause of triumph. This, say they, is the consequence of your zeal for an establishment. Besides this, I considered myself 
in some measure as an advocate for the army. I loved them, 
from my acquaintance with some individuals, and for the sufferings which as a body they had bravely and patiently endured ; and, therefore, I could not but suffer when I found them taking steps, which in my opinion cannot do them honor, and 
which incapacitated me from urging, as I otherwise should have done, every redress in our power of their grievances. 
</p><p>
But what chiefly affected v me was, that this meeting of delegates from brigades, in a mixture of civil and military capacity, carries with it the air of deeper design, than I believe to 
be in the bosoms of those, who were immediately concerned. 
It was by procedures such as these, that the good Fairfax made way for a crafty Cromwell, and that he dismissed a 
tedious wrangling Parliament, and established a military despotism. It is a melancholy truth, that when one faction takes 
possession of the human heart, men are hurried into extremes, 
which make considerate people tremble. I will not do your 
army the injustice even to permit a thought, that they wish to 
get rid of their General. But, Sir, their, and your, and our 
enemies, do not want the confidence to say so, and indeed to 
say that they can prove it, and to attempt that proof from the 
manner of procuring (agitating as they term it) the petition 
in question. Certainly could such ideas be inculcated, it 
would answer their views. It would also answer their views 
to instil into the army a distrust of Congress, and therefore I 
doubt not but the enemies of both are assiduous in this business. I find also the British commissioners are so bare faced, 
as to hold out the bait of promotion in the royal army to such, 
as will fall in with their designs, and doubtless a peculiar portion of their bounty will be dispensed to those, who shall sow 
the seeds of dissensions in an army, which, as they cannot 
conquer it, it is their only resource to divide. 
</p><p>
Thinking on this subject as I do, it did and does appear to me my duty, as a good citizen, thoroughly to discountenance every measure of this kind, particularly when it is 
ushered forth, as the first mention of this affair was to me, by 
an observation that the army had it in their power to do themselves justice. It makes me unhappy to learn, that such 
discourse prevails I am certain that they who use it have no design ; but they should consider that it affords matter for 
the designs of others to work upon. It has not made any serious impression, I believe, on the minds of those, whose opinions have real weight, because it is considered as one of those 
light expressions, which flow from the luxuriance of the imagination. Little do those, who say such things, know the difficulties of subsisting an army. 
</p><p>
The Marquis will hand you a plan, on which I shall say 
nothing, because I have already had a great deal of trouble 
with it, and he could say more than I can write in a week, 
and you know more of the subject than all of us together. 
</p><p>
We have no news. Let me then tell you what has the 
merit of truth, if not the charms of novelty, that I am, dear 
General, very sincerely yours, 
</p><p>

P. S. <a href='/results.php?tla=chl' rel=''>General Lee's</a> affair hangs by the eyelids. We 
spent one day upon it without even touching upon its merits. 
The debate Was, in what manner to proceed to a decision. 
Some contended for the propriety of resolving simply to approve or disapprove of the sentence. Others were for entering into the considerations of the charges, and the evidence 
on them separately, without however making any entry on the 
minutes. A third for doing this, and making the entries. 
This, as the most systematic method, I supported, for truly I 
know not how to determine in the lump. Granting him 
guilty of all the charges, it is too light a punishment. And 
if he is not guilty, in the opinion of Congress, of any one, 
there would be an injustice in not declaring their opinion.

Conway has again applied for a certificate of his good services, and I have again opposed the grant of it. This letter 
lies on the table. Again, my friend, adieu.
