Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In the fullest confidence I inform you, that I intend to make an attempt by surprise upon the enemy's posts on the north end of York Island, on Monday night. 
Should we be happy enough to succeed, and be able to hold our conquest, the advantages will be greater 
than can be well imagined. But I cannot flatter myself, that the enemy will permit the latter, unless I am 
suddenly and considerably reinforced. I shall march 
down the remainder of this army, and I have hopes that 
the French force will be near at hand by that time. 
But I shall, notwithstanding, direct die alarm-guns and 
beacons to be fired in case of success ; and I have to 
request, that yom Excellency will, upon such signals, 
communicate the meaning of them to the militia, and 
put yourself at the head of them, and much with the 
utmost expedition towards Kingsbridge, bringing with 
you three or four days' provision at least. In that time I think we shall have so arranged matters as to have Utde need of the militia suddenly called out. I have, 
upon a hope that we shall succeed, ordered Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a> to send down the regular troops immediately. Should circumstances make it necessary, 
I can countermand the order. I am, &,c.
