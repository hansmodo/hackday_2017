Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your opinion of the absolute necessity of a repeal 
of all Under laws, before a new species of paper, 
though upon ever so good an establishment, will gain 
credit with the public, is certainly founded upon reason and justified by experience. I am extremely 
obliged to you for the assistance you have already 
afforded us in the article of flour. Without that aid, 
we should have been already distressed ; and I must 
confess to you, that I see no prospect of being supplied, but through your means, as, by the last letters 
from the President and Council of Pennsylvania, I could 
expect little or nothing from that quarter. Whether 
the Assembly, in their present session, have adopted 
any more vigorous measures to obtain supplies, I have 
not yet been informed. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='co-worker met'>General Schuyler</a> a few days ago acquainted you, 
that there were more considerable quantities of flour 
upon the North River, than he had expected. The 
ease and cheapness of transporting any in that situation will undoubtedly induce you to secure what may 
be in that quarter, should you find yourself enabled to 
extend your purchases. I have the honor to be, with 
perfect respect and esteem, &,c.
