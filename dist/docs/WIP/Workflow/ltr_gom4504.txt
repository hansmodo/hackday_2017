[To the President of the Council of Safety]
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday noon, and last evening had some 
little conversation with the General and others upon the state 
of our affairs. They are far from being such as could be wished. 
General Nixon's brigade, which ought to have consisted of at 
least fifteen hundred men. has four regiments, the whole of 
which do not contain six hundred. In short, not to enter into 
a tedious detail, two thousand six hundred continental troops, 
and two thousand militia, of which about one thousand are 
from this State, make the whole force in this quarter. To 
the westward there are about five hundred. If the enemy 
would follow, I know not when we should stop, as matters now 
stand. We have only two old iron field pieces. We can get 
no more, <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker'>General Washington</a> having ordered them all to the 
southern department. Fort Anne is abandoned, and Fort 
George will be so by tomorrow, if it be not sooner taken. 
Everything is moved away from this place, as fast as it can be down to Moses Creek, a post five miles from hence, where 
the General proposes to assemble his army. If the enemy 
give us some time, I imagine the roads will be so obstructed, 
that, with the help of a few brave fellows in the woods, we 
should be able so to annoy <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, as to prevent him 
from penetrating far into the country. A body of troops are 
to be formed to the eastward of this, in order to cover the 
Grants (Vermont) and harrass the rear of the enemy, if they 
come down Hudson's river. By the bye, I imagine the inhabitants of that country will join <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a>, who has issued a 
proclamation calling them in to confer with Colonel Skene. 
He has issued another well written proclamation, which has 
been freely circulated. It is dated at camp, near Ticonderoga, 
from which circumstance, as well as from the matter of it, I 
am led to believe he expects much aid from the tories. Upon 
the whole, I think we shall do very well, but this opinion is 
founded merely upon the barriers, which nature has raised 
against all access from the northward. I just now mentioned 
to the General the calling out of the militia of Tryon county. 
He says we may call, but we shall not get them. This is by 
no means a comfortable idea. I have the honor to be,
