SIR : You will, as soon as you are ready, proceed to sea under your sealed orders, with this modification, however : you will, on falling in with the Cyane, 
send her immediately to San Francisco, instead of detaining her on the coast as heretofore directed. 
</p><p>
The Congress and Cyane will, by this arrangement, it is expected, be ready to relieve the Savannah and Portsmouth. 
</p><p>
If despatches from the government should arrive at Mazatlan between this and the first of December, you will open them ; and, if notice of peace, you will 
leave copies of the despatches at Mazatlan for me, in case I should arrive there after you have left, and come to San Francisco and prepare the Savannah to return to the United States. 
</p><p>
If Mr. Norris should arrive from the United States at Mazatlan before I reach there, you will bring him in the Savannah or send him in the Portsmouth 
as soon as possible to this place, without opening the despatches. The enclosed letter contains a despatch for the Secretary of the Navy. You will please to 
make every exertion, without regard to expense, to get it forwarded by Mr. Mott, or some one else. 
</p><p>
You will also draw for the use of this squadron any sum of money, not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars, that you may be enabled to get at Mazatlan. 
</p><p>
Please to seal the letter to Mott, Talbot & Co. before you deliver it ; I leave it open in case you should find it best to deliver the despatch to other hands. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON, Commodore, &c. 
</p><p>
To CAPTAIN WM. MERVINE, 
</p><p>
United States Frigate Savannah, harbour of San Francisco.
