Dear General, 
</p><p>
A few days ago I received intelligence, that a party, consisting of thirty odd Wyandot Indians, had 
crossed the Ohio River, five miles below Fort Mcintosh, and had hid thirteen small bark canoes upon 
our shore. I immediately ordered out two parties of 
militia, to go in search of them, and cover the harvesters. At the same time I detached Captain McIntyre, to form an ambuscade opposite to the enemy's 
craft. Five men, who were reaping in a field, discovered the Indians, and, presuming their party was 
small, went out to attack them; but four of them 
were immediately killed, and the other taken, before 
the militia could be collected. But Captain McIntyre 
attacked them in their craft, and many of them 
were doubtless killed and wounded. Two canoes 
were sunk, and the prisoner retaken; but the water 
was too deep for our party to ascertain the number of killed. The Indians left all their craft, and in 
them two guns, six blankets, eleven tomahawks, 
eleven paint-bags, eight ear-wheels, a large brass kettle, and many other articles. The Indians informed 
the prisoner that fifteen Wyandots had marched towards Hannah's Town. 
</p><p>
Upon receiving this information, I immediately detached another party up the Alleghany River, with 
two Delaware Indians, to take their tracks, and make 
pursuit ; but, as this party is not yet returned, I cannot inform you of its success. It is with great concern I inform your Excellency, that there does not 
remain, in our magazines, provision to subsist the 
troops more than eight days, at full rations ; nor can 
I conceive how supplies can be procured in time to 
prevent their experiencing great want. I have proposed a fair plan to encourage the inhabitants to sell 
us provision, upon the credit of the United States, 
but have no great certainty of success. I have submitted the plan to the Honorable Board of War, and 
hope it will meet with approbation. 
</p><p>
Should I be fortunate enough to obtain supplies in 
time, I intend to penetrate the Wyandot country, 
this fall, and distress them and their allies by every 
possible exertion; and I expect Colonel Clark, as he 
is reenforced, will pay the Shawanese a visit about 
the same time. I should be exceeding happy to wait 
upon your Excellency, at the close of the campaign, 
but I am grown so poor that I cannot bear the expense of so long a journey, at the present extravagant rates. I have the honor to be, with the most 
exalted respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>

July Tld. The party of fifteen Indians, mentioned 
above, crossed the Ohio River at Crow's Island, four 
miles above Fort Mcintosh, killed and scalped one 
man, and returned. A party from hence, and another 
from Fort Mcintosh, are in pursuit of them. A party 
of men, just arrived from Wheeling, found two of the 
Wyandot Indians, who were killed by Captain McIntyre's party, floating upon the water, and have brought 
in their scalps.
