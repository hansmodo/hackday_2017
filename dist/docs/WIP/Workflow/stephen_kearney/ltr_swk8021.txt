SIR : In my communication to you of yesterday's date I stated that I had learned that you were engaged in organizing a civil 
government for California. I referred you to the President's instructions to me (the original of which you have seen, and copies 
of which I furnished you) to perform that duty, and I added that if you had any authority from the President, or any of his organs, 
for what you were doing, I would cheerfully acquiesce, and, if you had not such authority, I demanded that you would cease further proceedings in the matter. 
</p><p>
Your reply of the same date refers me to a conversation held at San Diego, and adds that you cannot do any thing or desist from 
doing any thing or alter any thing on your (my) demand. As, in consequence of the defeat of the enemy on the 8th and 9th instants, 
by the troops under my command, and the capitulation entered into on the 13th instant by <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='co-worker'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> with the 
leaders of the Californians, in which the people under arms and in the field agree to disperse and remain quiet and peaceable, the 
country may now, for the first time, be considered as conquered and taken possession of by us ; and, as I am prepared to carry out 
the President's instructions to me, which you oppose, I must, for the purpose of preventing a collision between us and possibly a 
civil war in consequence of it, remain silent for the present, leaving with you the great responsibility of doing that for which you have 
no authority, and preventing me from complying with the President's orders. 
</p><p>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
S. W. KEARNEY, 
Brigadier-G-eneral U. S. A. 
</p><p>
COMMODORE R. F. STOCKTON, U. S. N., 
Acting Governor of California.
