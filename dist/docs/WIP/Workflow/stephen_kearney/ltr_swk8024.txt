DEAR FREMONT : I am here in possession of this place, with sailors and marines. We met and defeated the whole force of the Californians the 8th and 9th. They 
have not now to exceed three hundred men concentrated. Avoid charging them, and come to me at this place. 
</p><p>
Acknowledge the hour of receipt of this, and when I may expect you. Regards to Russell. Yours, 
</p><p>
S. W. KEARNEY, Brigadier- General.

LIEUTENANT-COLONEL FREMONT.
