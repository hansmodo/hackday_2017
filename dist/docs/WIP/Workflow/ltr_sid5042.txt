</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to lay before Congress a few observations on the extracts from Mr Arthur Lee's letter, dated Paris, June 
1st, 1778, read in Congress the 3d instant, which were ordered to be communicated to me. Mr Lee begins by 
saying that, M. Monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us, and the grounds of 
them J you will see that they are accounts, which Mr Deane ought to have settled.
</p><p>
Not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent, I can only reply generally by informing Congress, that I contracted with M. Monthieu (nearly at the lime that I contracted with Mons. Beaumarchais for the stores) to procure ships to transport them over to America; the rate, I was told in Paris and elsewhere, was as low as could be 
then procured in France ; it has risen since that time. The ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable 
time to and from America. Mons. Beaumarchais was my surety. The difficulty met with in getting away the stores 
was such, that the last of the ships did not sail from Marseilles until in September, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. The delay of near twelve 
months of some of them in France, and an uncommon delay of all of them, occasioned by repeated counter orders, and 
fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores, 
as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in America, as for instance, of the Amphitrite, from April until the 
October following, with the capture of them, were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making 
the contract, and entitled M. Monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated. Before 
the last ship sailed, therefore, M. Monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon ; on 
which <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to Mons. Chaumont ; the submission was made 
and signed. M. Monthieu, on his return from Marseilles, (to which place he went immediately to embark and send 
off the remainder of the stores) urged Chaumont to undertake it. I did the same ; he declined, telling me 
that he found Mr Lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition, and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had 
any concerns with, that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners, while 
he was one of them ; but as M. Monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners, he thought it best to settle 
the whole at once, and when the whole was ready for a settlement, if Mr Lee would then desire him to undertake it, 
he would do it as well to oblige us as M. Monthieu, for whom he had a regard. This put off the settlement for the time. 
</p><p>
Mr Lee proceeds to say, " It is this sort of neglect, and studied confusion, that has prevented Mr Adams and myself, 
after a tedious examination of the papers left with <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money. All we can find is, that millions have been expended, and almost every thing remains to be paid for." 
</p><p>
I am not surprised at any thing of this kind from Mr Lee, nor that Mr John Adams has not joined with him in this 
letter, though I dare say, that gentleman knows his duty, and has done it, as well to the public as to me. After 
premising that Mr Lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account, I 
will lay before Congress the facts, which he had before him when he wrote this letter, after which Congress will be able 
to judge whether Mr Lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions. It is certain, 
that Mr Lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the lime of my leaving Paris, 
amounted to (livres) 3,753,250 
</p><p>
And that the balance due Mr Grand, the 27th March, was 203,738 17 
</p><p>
And that the whole expenditures to that day, consequently was (livres) 4,040,988 17 
</p><p>
In the next place, it will appear, that by much the greater part of this was actually expended and paid out by and 
with Mr Lee's consent and orders at the time ; the whole was well known to him, as he had, from lime to time, access 
to Mr Grand's books, and Mr Grand delivered him copies thereof up lo the 27th of March last, by which he had before 
him an account of every payment that had been made, and I sent him in writing; an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence, or which had not been made by his written order. 
</p><p>
The accounts of the particular articles in detail, not being here, I am unable to explain every charge in Mr Grand's 
account, it is sufficient that Mr Grand's account shows, that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was 
perfectly well known to Mr Lee, when he wrote the above account of millions expended, and represented he knew not 
how to show this. I have stated Mr Grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before, and have brought 
the different payments (or particular objects made to different people into one view, as will be seen in the annexed 
stale or explanation of Mr Grand's account. 
</p><p>
I have no design in answering this part of Mr Lee's 
letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively, that nothing can be more groundless and unjust, 
than for him to represent that millions had been profusely 
expended, and as if ho knew not in what manner or to what purpose. The amount of expenditures, until the time of my 
leaving Paris, was 4,040,938 17 livers, and it appears, as 
well from the nature of the account, as from the knowledge 
Mr Lee had of the transactions, that he knew generally 
of the payment of every livre, and to whom it had been 
made, having the accounts and the explanation of them in 
his hands, up to the very day I set out from Paris. The 
particular application, indeed, of every part, could not be 
known until the several accounts should be given in. ISIr 
Lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of 
the monies to Mr Williams, and the other principal payments, and was well informed of the business which he (Mr 
Williams) was executing. By this staling of the account 
it will appear, that the commissioners, for their private 
expenses, from December, <a href='/results.php?year=1770'>1770</a>, to 27th March, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, 
for the support and relief of Americans, escaping from 
prison in England, for the payment of Mons. Dumas, agent 
in Holland, the sending of expresses, the purchase of a 
large quantity of shoes, which were sent to Nantes, to be 
shipped for America, and for several less disbursements, 
had of Mr Grand only the sum of 244,285 livres, equal to 
the sum often thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds 
ten shillings sterling, which is of itself a demonstration, that 
there was no misapplication of the public monies, since 
Mr Lee has written, that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself. Whether or not 
extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased, will be an after consideration. 
</p><p>
Mr Arthur Lee says, " That almost every thing still remains to be paid for." 
</p><p>
I really know not what he means. Things once paid for are not to be paid for a second lime, and the payments Stated above are proved, by Mr Grand's accounts, to have 
been bona fide made. " Bargains," he says, " of the most extravagant kind, have been made with this Mons. Monthieu and others j" and then he proceeds to give an example. 
As to the bargains I was concerned in with this man, and with every other person, I totally deny the fact, and the example given is but a mere pretence. I am so confident 
of the contrary, that I will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me, or with my consent, in Europe, the contract with the Farmers-General excepted, (which was 
partly political at the time,) on myself, and will be bound to abide the profit or loss, leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in Europe. Mr Lee informs us of one 
hundred thousand livres given to Mr Hodge, and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about £3000, or 72000 livres, and adds, " for what purpose the surplus was given to 
Mr Hodge, how the public came to pay for her refitting, and at length die vessel, and her prize money, made over to Mr Ross and Mr Hodge, without a farthing being brought to 
public account, rests with Mr Deane or Mr Hodge to explain ;" and in a few lines further he says, "you will see my name is not to the contracts ;" but he forgets to add, — 
that he was at Berlin when they were made. What I have already observed upon in Mr Lee's letter, and what I purpose to notice, confirms me in the opinion, which Dr 
Franklin and some others have for some time had of him, that, from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind, ho is at last arrived on the 
very borders of insanity, and that at times he even passes the line ; and it gives me pleasure, though it is but a melancholy one, that I can attribute to the misfortunes of 
his head, what I must otherwise place to a depravity of heart. 
</p><p>
Mr Hodge went to Dunkirk, by order of the commissioners. They sent him in consequence of orders from the Secret Committee ; he purchased and fitted out two vessels, 
a fact though forgotten by Mr Lee, known to every one at the time. From what that brave and virtuous young 
American did and suffered on the occasion, it was the common topic of conversation every where ; it raised insurance 
in England ten per cent for a time. Mr Hodge, to appease the British Ambassador, was sent to the Bastile, and Cunningham, making his cruise round England and Ireland, put 
into Spain without prize money equal lo the repairs he wanted. Mr Hodge was released from his imprisonment, and one of the first things he did, was to give Mr Lee the 
account of his whole disbursements in writing. Mr Hodge had taken a small interest in the adventure from the first, and proposed following Cunningham into Spain by land, 
and making a cruise with him. He proposed that Mr Ross and he should purchase the vessel ; but as a price could not 
easily be agreed upon, they proposed to take the vessel as she was, and do the best with her against the common 
enemy, and to account to Congress therefor. Mr Ross desired that such an agreement should be signed by the 
commissioners for his security. I know not that it was ever done. I have only to add on this subject, that all the 
monies received by Mr Hodge amotmted to 92,720 livres 18 3, in the whole, and that Mr Hodge rendered us other services besides equipping these two vessels. 
</p><p>
Speaking of the contracts, he says, " they were in fact concealed from me with the utmost care, as was every 
other means of my knowing how these affairs were conducted." I have in reply to relate the following facts 
which are easy to be ascertained. Mr Lee, on his return from Berlin, wss made acquainted with the contracts ; 
Messrs Holker, (now in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>) Sabbatier and Desprez repeatedly conferred with Mr Lee on the subject in my 
presence, and when they brought in their accounts Mr Lee assisted in adjusting them, and signed with us the orders for 
the payment, as Mr Grand's account and the orders and accounts themselves will show. It is true, the execution of M. Monthieu's contract was not completed, when I left 
Paris, and therefore his accounts could not be settled. Mr Williams had the oversight of repairing the arms in the 
magazine at Nantes ; he settled his accounts with his workmen monthly ; he had a frigate fitting out for the commissioners, 10,000 suits of clothes making up, a number of 
shirts, shoes, etc. together with the charge of all the stores the commissioners were sending to Nantes to be shipped. 
Monthly accounts were not to be expected in reason from a man in such a situation ; it could not be done if promised, 
and Mr Williams is a gentleman of too much probity as well as knowledge in business, to promise what he cannot 
perform. It is not enough to say, that no man in France enjoys a better character for strict honor and probity, both 
at Court and in the city, than Mons. Chaumont. Justice must add, there is no man enjoys it perhaps so universally 
through the kingdom, among the merchants, the farmers or husbandmen, and mechanics, in all which branches of business he is constantly speculating. This man is the friend 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> ; I have the pleasure of knowing him to be mine, and what is more, the friend of my country, on all 
and in the most trying occasions. I do not wonder that Mr Lee should appear jealous of this gentleman, as well as of 
every body else, a select few excepted, and very few indeed are those, who escape his jealous suspicions, either in Europe or America. It is a melancholy truth, but 
justice to the public requires my declaring it, that I never knew Mr Lee, from his first coming to Paris, satisfied 
with any one person he did business with, whether of a public or private nature, and his dealings, whether for trifles 
or for things of importance, almost constantly ended in dispute, sometimes in litigious quarrels. 
</p><p>
Mr Lee lived some time in Chaumont's house. M. Chaumont knew him perfectly well, and was not reserved in speaking his opinion of him. I am sorry to be thus long 
on so disagreeable a subject, a subject which I cautiously waived entering on, in my narration to Congress, not choosing to trouble them with matters, which they might deem of a 
personal nature. I am grieved to have been forced on it at all, and hope never to be obliged to resume it, and as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an 
account, and every thing goes to the debtor credit, the folio for profit or loss, so I must solicit that <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and the honorable Mr Adams may be directed to see the settlement 
of all those accounts immediately on my return to Paris, 
and as there has been a charge made by Mr Lee, of profusion, of extravagant contracts, and the like, that those gentlemen be authorised to submit the accounts, with every 
allegation of the kind, to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot, and that 
orders may be given, that whatever sum may be found duo from the commissioners may by them be instantly paid 
into the hands of the banker for Congress, and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may 
be the balance, to the person in whose favor the same shall be found. By this means the truth will he demonstrated, 
and justice done, which is all I have ever wished for. Having forgot to mention it in its place, I must be permitted 
to add here, that the first vessel purchased and fitted out by Mr Hodge was, on the return and imprisonment of Cunningham, detained by order from Court, and a second 
purchased, in which Cunningham went on his second cruise. The first was put up for sale at Dunkirk, but not disposed 
of when I left Paris, at least I had not heard of it. 
I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
With the most respectful attachment, S>:c.

P. S. I have mentioned money paid Mons. Dumas, as part of the aggregate sum of 244,285 livres 13s. lOd. There 
will be found the sum of <a href='/results.php?year=4351'>4351</a> livres 5s. 3d. paid by Messrs Horneca Fitzeau & Co. to Mons. Dumas, and for other 
expenses. I fear on a review, that the brevity I aimed at may cause some mistake ; it is therefore proper to observe, 
that but a part of this sum was paid to Mons. Dumas, a part being for other disbursements, independent of which sum the commissioners made other remittances to Mons. Dumas.
