Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I devote this first leisure moment which has occurred 
since my arrival, to the pleasure of writing a few lines 
to you. 
</p><p>
Our journey was pursued, without any avoidable intermission, to Bayonne, where it became advisable to rest a 
few days, and where we received many kind attentions from 
Mons. Formalaguer, to whom, it seems, you had be m so 
obliging as to make friendly mention of us. That city is 
turning its attention to the American trade, and its situation, 
in certain respects, is favourable to that design. 
</p><p>
Your friend, Mons. Risleau, at Bordeaux, pleased me 
much ; there is a frankness in his manner, and a warmth 
about his heart, that is very engaging. I made some agreeable acquaintances in that city, and wish I could have staid 
longer with them. Commerce appears to flourish there ; 
and if their trade with America could be properly protected, 
there is reason to think that it would soon become an object 
of great importance. 
</p><p>
On leaving Bordeaux, Mrs. Jay caught an intermitting 
fever, which, with the great demand made for post-horses 
made by the Prince du Nord, delayed us greatly. 
</p><p>
I went with <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> to Versailles the day after our 
arrival. The minister spoke of you in terms very friendly, 
and very just, and my next visit would have been to the 
Countess de Montmorin ; but as we learned that a mail was 
to be dismissed for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> today, we returned immediately to prepare our despatches, so that I have been 
obliged to deny myself the honour of paying my respects 
to a lady, whose character and connexion with you render 
me particularly desirous of seeing. To-morrow we are 
promised a visit from the Marquis de La Fayette and his 
lad} 7 , after which I shall take the first opportunity " meponer 
a los pies de la Condesa Lc Montmorin" I am not sure 
that this is good Spanish ; if not, I wish the inspectors of the 
post-office may be so obliging as to correct it. 
</p><p>
I had written thus far when a variety of interruptions 
prevented my proceeding for several days, and then I became violently attacked with the influenza, from which I 
am now just beginning to recover. It has been very severe 
on all my family. Mrs. Jay has been obliged to struggle 
with that and the intermittent fever together, and this is 
the first day she has been out of the house since our arrival. 
</p><p>
I am very much mortified at not having yet seen the 
Countess de Montmorin. The day before I was taken sick 
I did myself the honour of calling at her house, but she was 
from home. As soon as the doctor sets me at liberty, the 
first use I will make of it will be to renew my visit. 
</p><p>
What I have seen of France pleases me exceedingly. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> has received some late noble proofs of the 
king's liberality, in the liquidation of his accounts, and the 
terms and manner of paying the balance due on them. No 
people understand doing civil things so well as the French. 
The aids they have afforded us received additional value 
from the generous and gracious manner in which they were 
supplied ; and that circumstance will have a proportionable 
decree of influence in cementing the connexion formed 
between the two countries. 
</p><p>
I think the late resolutions and conduct of America, 
respecting Mr. Carlton's proposed correspondence with 
Congress, must have given you pleasure. As Mons. de 
Clonard passed through Spain, he doubtless brought you 
copies. Some letters and instructions I have received by 
the same vessel, contain strong evidence of the determination of Congress to consult the interest and wishes of France 
upon all occasions. 
</p><p>
I have seen and dined with the Count d'Aranda ; his conversation leads me to suspect that his court is, at last, in 
earnest. This, however, is a question which facts, and not 
words, must determine. It is hard to judge of men, especially of old politicians ; at present I like the count, for he 
appears frank and candid, as well as sagacious. They say 
he is a little obstinate, but, for my part, I prefer plain-dealing, 
obstinate men, to those unstable ones who, like the moon, 
change once a fortnight, and are mere dispensers of borrowed light. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear mentioning, that I am particularly 
indebted to the polite attention of your friend, Count 
d'Estaing. He is at Passy, enjoying otium cam dignitateThere is a singular taste displayed in the ornaments of his 
house. The very walls (like Portius in Addison's Cato) 
are ambitiously sententious, and show that they do not 
belong to an ordinary man. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, with great esteem and attachment, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
