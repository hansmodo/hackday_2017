My dear Sir

. . . The expressions in the message were the President's own not dictated nor suggested by any body else 
&amp; inserted in opposition to the wishes, if not the advice of all his habitual counsellors. It is not therefore a cabinet 
measure, nor a party measure, but a personal measure. As such it is far less dangerous because if the people know that 
this is not an opinion which they must necessarily adopt as a portion of their party creed but an opinion of the 
President alone a very honest opinion though a very erroneous one then the question will be decided on its own merits. . . .
