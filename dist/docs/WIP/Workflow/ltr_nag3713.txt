Since I wrote your Excellency by Major Giles, 
Lord Cornwallis has been constantly in pursuit of the 
light infantry and the prisoners, and is now between 
the Shallow Ford, upon the Yadkin and Salem, one 
of the Moravian towns ; and still pushing into the 
country with great rapidity. The moment I was informed of the movements of Lord Cornwallis, I put 
the army in motion on Pedee, and left it under the 
command of Brigadier-General linger, and set out to 
join the light infantry, in order to collect the militia, 
and embarrass the enemy till we could effect a junction of our forces. 
</p><p>
General Morgan, after the defeat of Tarleton, had 
very judiciously made forced marches up into the 
country, and happily crossed the Catawba the evening before a great rain, which prevented the enemy 
from following him for several days, during which 
time the prisoners were got over the Yadkin, and on 
their march for Dan River, which I hope they have 
passed, and are in Virginia. 
</p><p>
On my arrival at the light infantry camp, I found 
them at Sherald's Ford, on the Catawba. The enemy were a little lower down the river, at Mc Cowen's forces and the river still so high that they could not 
cross. We made the best disposition we could to 
stop them, when the river should fall. But the fords 
were so numerous, and our forces so small, that we 
could not effect it. General Davidson, who had great 
influence among the Muhlenberg and Roan militia, 
had made use of all the arguments in his power to 
get the militia into the field, but without effect. 
They had been so much in service, and their families 
so distressed, that they were loath to leave home, 
even on the most pressing occasion. 
</p><p>
The enemy crossed at McCowen's Ford, where General Davidson was posted with the greatest part of 
the militia, who fled at the first discharge. The enemy made good their landing, and the militia retreated. A place of rendezvous was appointed for the militia to collect at, who were posted at the different 
fords up and down the river above thirty miles. Part 
of them halted about seven miles short of the place 
of rendezvous, and were overtaken by Tarleton, and 
dispersed. I waited that night at the place appointed for the militia to collect at, until morning ; but 
not a man appeared. The light infantry continued 
their march to Salisbury, and crossed the Yadkin. 
But before we got over all the baggage and stores, 
the enemy were at our heels. A pretty smart skirmish happened between a party of our riflemen and 
the advance of the enemy near the ford. We had 
secured all the boats, and the river was so high that 
the enemy could not follow us. 
</p><p>
Heavy rains, deep creeks, bad roads, poor horses, 
and broken harness, as well as delays for want of 
provisions, prevented our forming a junction as early 
as I expected; and, fearing that the river might fall 
so as to be fordable, I ordered the army to file off to this place, where part of them arrived last evening; the rest I hope will be in this night. The enemy, finding they conld not cross the Trading Ford, 
marched up to the Shallow Ford, where they passed 
the night before last, and are within twenty-five or 
thirty miles of this place. 
</p><p>
As soon as I arrived at the light infantry camp, I 
wrote letters to all the militia officers over the mountains, and in the upper country, to embody their 
men and join the army as early as possible. But 
very few have joined us, and those principally without arms or ammunition. We have no provisions but 
what we receive from our daily collections. Under 
these circumstances, I called a Council, who unanimously advised to avoid an- action, and to retire beyond the Roanoke immediately. A copy of the proceedings I have the honor to inclose, 
</p><p>
I had previously ordered all the stores and heavy 
baggage to be removed to Prince Edward CourtHouse ; and informed Governor Nash of our situation. 
I have formed a light army, composed of the cavalry 
of the first and third regiments, and the legion, 
amounting to two hundred and forty; a detachment 
of two hundred and eighty infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Howard ; the infantry of Lieutenant-Colonel Lee's legion, and sixty Virginia riflemen ; making in the whole seven hundred men, who will be 
ordered, with the militia, to harass the enemy in their 
advance, check their progress, and, if possible, give 
us an opportunity to retire without a general action. 
</p><p>
The force under Lord Cornwallis, consists of between twenty-five hundred and three thousand troops, 
including near three hundred dragoons, and their 
mounted infantry. They have destroyed their wagons, 
and are completely equipped as light infantry. 
I have the honor to inclose a copy of a letter 
from Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, extracts of two letters 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>, and a copy of a letter from a 
well-informed gentleman, respecting the operations at 
Wilmington. General Morgan is so unveil that he 
has left the army. The enemy, since the action of 
the 17th ultimo, have pursued him upwards of two 
hundred miles. He was obliged to leave the wounded, the arms, wagons, and carriages of the artillery, 
taken in the action; but I hope they have not fallen 
into the hands of the enemy. 
</p><p>
I have ordered <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a> to cross the Santee River, and General Sumpter to collect the militia in 
the upper part of South Carolina. <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague met'>General Pickens</a> 
has orders to take command of the men in arms in 
the rear of the enemy. I have wrote <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>, 
the late Governor of Virginia, to collect, if possible, 
fourteen or fifteen hundred volunteers, to aid us, 
should the enemy attempt to pursue us beyond the 
Dan River. I had the satisfaction to receive your 
Excellency's despatches of the 27th of December, and 
the 2d and 9th of January, a few days since. I 
have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest 
esteem and respect, yours, &c.,
