Among the many who visited us, in the beginning of <a href='/results.php?year=1861'>1861</a>, there was Mr. Bradford. I took a dislike 
to him the first time I ever saw him, and, being accustomed to say just what I pleased to all the 
other gentlemen, tried it with him. It was at dinner, and for a long while I had the advantage, and though father would sometimes look grave, Gibbes, 
and all at my end of the table, would scream with laughter. At last Mr. Bradford commenced to retaliate, and my dislike changed into respect for a man 
who could make an excellent repartee with perfect good-breeding; and after dinner, when the others took their leave, and he asked permission to remain, 
during his visit, which lasted until ten o clock, he had gone over such a variety of subjects, conversing 
so well upon all, that Miriam and I were so interested that we forgot to have the gas lit!
