With what extraordinary care we prepared for our ride yesterday! One would have thought that 
some great event was about to take place. But in spite of our long toilet, we stood ready equipped 
almost an hour before Colonel Breaux arrived. I was standing in a novel place upon the bannisters 
looking over the fields to see if he was coming and, not seeing him, made some impatient exclamation, when lo! he appeared before me, having only 
been concealed by the wood-pile, and O my prophetic soul ! Captain Morrison was by his side ! 
</p><p>
There was quite a cavalcade of us : Mr. Carter and his wife, Mrs. Badger and Mrs. Worley, in two 
buggies; the three boys, who, of course, followed on horseback, and the two gentlemen, Miriam, Anna, 
and I, riding also. It was really a very pretty sight, when Captain Morrison and I, who took the lead 
going, would reach the top of one of the steep hills and look down on the procession in the hollow below. 
Fortunately it was a very cloudy evening ; for, starting at four, it would have been very unpleasant to 
ride that distance with the sun in our faces. 
</p><p>
As we reached the town we heard the loud report of two cannon which caused the elder ladies to halt 
and suggest the propriety of a return. But if it was a gunboat, that was the very thing I was anxious to 
see ; so we hurried on to the batteries. It proved to be only practicing, however. At the first one we 
stopped at, the crew of the Arkansas were drilling. After stopping a while there, we followed the river 
to see the batteries below. It was delightful to ride 
on the edge of a high bluff with the muddy Mississippi below, until you fancied what would be the 
probable sensation if the horse should plunge down into the waters; then it ceased to be so pleasant. 
The great, strong animal I rode could have carried 
me over without a protest on my part ; for the ridiculous bit in his mouth was by no means suited to his 
strength ; and it would require a more powerful arm 
than mine to supply the deficiency. Miriam had 
generously sacrificed her own comfort to give him to 
me; and rode fiery Joe instead of her favorite. But 
it was by no means a comfort to me. Then Anna 
was not reconciled to her pony while I was on such a 
fine horse, until I proposed an exchange, and gladly 
dismounted near an old mill two miles and a half 
below Port Hudson, as we returned home. 
</p><p>
In leaving the town, we lost sight of the buggies, 
as there was no carriage road that might follow the 
bluff; and though there was one just back, we never 
saw our buggies again. Once, following a crescent, 
far below us lay the water battery concealed by the 
trees that grew by the water's edge, looking, from 
where we stood, like quite a formidable precipice. 
Then still beyond, after leaving the river, we passed 
through a camp where the soldiers divided their 
attention equally between eating their supper and 
staring at us in the most profound silence. Then, 
through an old gate, down a steep hill, past a long 
line of rifle-pits, a winding road, and another camp 
where more men stared and cooked their supper, we 
came to the last battery but one, which lay so far 
below that it was too late to visit it. We returned 
highly delighted with what we had seen and our 
pleasant ride. It was late when we got back, as 
altogether our ride had been some fifteen miles in 
length. As soon as we could exchange our habits 
for our evening dresses, we rejoined our guests at 
the supper-table, where none of us wanted for an 
appetite except poor Captain Morrison, who could 
not be tempted by the dishes we so much relished. 
After supper, Colonel Breaux and I got into a discussion, rather, he talked, while I listened with eyes 
and ears, with all my soul. . . . What would I not 
give for such knowledge ! He knows everything, and 
can express it all in the clearest, purest language, 
though he says he could not speak a word of English at fourteen! 
</p><p>
The discussion commenced by some remark I 
made about physiognomy ; he took it up, and passed 
on to phrenology in which he is no great believer. 
From there he touched on the mind, and I listened, 
entranced, to him. Presently he asserted that I 
possessed reasoning faculties, which I fear me I very 
rudely denied. You see, every moment the painful 
conviction of my ignorance grew more painful still, 
until it was most humiliating; and I repelled it rather 
as a mockery. He described for my benefit the process of reasoning, the art of thinking. I listened more 
attentively still, resolving to profit by his words. . . . 
Then he turned the conversation on quite another 
theme. Health was the subject. He delicately 
alluded to my fragile appearance, and spoke of the 
necessity of a strong constitution to sustain a vigorous mind. If the mind prevailed over the weak body, 
in its turn it became affected by decay, and would 
eventually lose its powers. It was applicable to all 
cases; he did not mean that I was sickly, but that 
my appearance bespoke one who had not been used 
to the exercise that was most necessary for me. 
Horseback rides, walks, fresh air were necessary to 
preserve health. No man had greater disgust for a 
freckled face than he; but a fair face could be pre 
served by the most ordinary precautions and even 
improved by such exercise. He illustrated my case 
by showing the difference between the flower growing 
in the sunshine and that growing in a cellar. Father's own illustration and very words, when he so 
often tried to impress on me the necessity of gaining 
a more robust frame than nature had bestowed! 
And a letter he had made Hal write me, showing 
the danger of such neglect, rose before me. I forgot 
Colonel Breaux; I remembered only the ardent 
desire of those two, who seemed to speak to me 
through his lips. It produced its effect. I felt the 
guilt I had incurred by not making greater efforts to 
gain a more robust frame; and putting on my sun-bonnet as I arose from the breakfast-table this 
morning, I took my seat here on the wide balcony 
where I have remained seated on the floor ever 
since, with a chair for a desk, trying to drink an 
extra amount of fresh air. 
</p><p>
I was sorry when Colonel Breaux arose to take his 
leave. As he took my hand, I said earnestly, 
"Thank you for giving me something to think 
about." He looked gratified, made some pleasant 
remark, and after talking a while longer, said good 
night again and rode off. While undressing, Miriam 
and I spoke of nothing else. And when I lay down, 
and looked in my own heart and saw my shocking 
ignorance and pitiful inferiority so painfully evident 
even to my own eyes, I actually cried. Why was I 
denied the education that would enable me to be the 
equal of such a man as Colonel Breaux and the 
others? He says the woman's mind is the same as 
the man's, originally; it is only education that 
creates the difference. Why was I denied that education? Who is to blame? Have I exerted fully the 
natural desire To Know that is implanted in all 
hearts? Have I done myself injustice in my self-taught ignorance, or has injustice been done to me? 
Where is the fault, I cried. Have I labored to improve the few opportunities thrown in my path, to 
the best of my ability? "Answer for yourself. With 
the exception of ten short months at school, where 
you learned nothing except arithmetic, you have 
been your own teacher, your own scholar, all your 
life, after you were taught by mother the elements 
of reading and writing. Give an account of your 
charge. What do you know?" Nothing! except that 
I am a fool! and I buried my face in the sheet; I did 
not like even the darkness to see me in my humiliation.
