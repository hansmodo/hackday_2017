I am getting well! Bless the Lord, O my soul! 
Life, health, and happiness dawn on my trembling 
view again! . . . Dr. Stone came to see me a few 
hours after I arrived ; two days after, he called again ; 
this morning I walked out to meet him when he was 
announced, and he asked me how my sister was. 
When I told him I was myself, "God bless my soul! 
You don't say so!" he exclaimed, evidently astonished at the resurrection.
