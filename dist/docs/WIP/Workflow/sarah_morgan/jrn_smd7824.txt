This morning while I was attending to my flowers 
. . . several soldiers stopped in front of me, and 
holding on the fence, commenced to talk about some 
brave Colonel, and a shooting affair last night. When 
all had gone except one who was watching me attentively, as he seemed to wish to tell me, I let him 
go ahead. The story was that Colonel McMillan was shot through the shoulder, breast, and liver, 
by three guerrillas while four miles from town last 
night, on a scout. He was a quarter of a mile from his 
own men at the time, killed one who shot him, took 
the other two prisoners, and fell from his horse himself, when he got within the lines. The soldier said 
these two guerrillas would probably be hanged, while 
the six we saw pass captives, Sunday, would probably be sent to Fort Jackson for life. I think the 
guerrilla affair mere murder, I confess; but what a 
dreadful fate for these young men ! One who passed 
Sunday was Jimmy's schoolmate, a boy of sixteen; 
another, Willie Garig, the pet of a whole family of 
good, honest country people. . . .

These soldiers will get in the habit of talking to 
me after a while, through my own fault. Yesterday 
I could not resist the temptation to ask the fate of 
the six guerrillas, and stopped two volunteers who 
were going by, to ask them. They discussed the fate 
of the country, told me Fort Pillow and <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a> 
were evacuated, the Mississippi opened from source 
to mouth; I told them of Banks's and <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan's</a> 
defeat; they assured me it would all be over in a 
month, which I fervently pray may be so; told 
me they were from Michigan (one was Mr. Bee, he 
said, cousin of our General); and they would probably have talked all day if I had not bowed myself 
away with thanks for their information. 
</p><p>
It made me ashamed to contrast the quiet, gentle 
manly, liberal way these volunteers spoke of us and 
our cause, with the rabid, fanatical, abusive violence 
of our own female Secession declaimers. Thank 
Heaven, I have never yet made my appearance as a 
Billingsgate orator on these occasions. All my violent feelings, which in moments of intense excitement 
were really violent, I have recorded in this book; I 
am happy to say only the reasonable dislike to seeing 
my country subjugated has been confided to the 
public ear, when necessary; and that even now, I 
confess that nothing but the reign of terror and gross 
prejudice by which I was surrounded at that time 
could justify many expressions I have here applied 
to them. Fact is, these people have disarmed me by 
their kindness. I expected to be in a crowd of ruffian soldiers, who would think nothing of cutting 
your throat or doing anything they felt like; and I 
find, among all these thousands, not one who offers 
the slightest annoyance or disrespect. The former is 
the thing as it is believed by the whole country, the 
latter the true state of affairs. I admire foes who 
show so much consideration for our feelings.

Contrast these with our volunteers from <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> all gentlemen who came to take the Garrison from Major Haskins. Several of them passing 
our gate where we were standing with the Brunots, one exclaimed, "What pretty girls!" It was a stage aside that we were supposed not to hear. "Yes," 
said another; "beautiful! but they look as though they could be fast." Fast! and we were not even speaking! not even looking at them! Sophie and I 
were walking presently, and met half a dozen. We had to stop to let them pass the crossing; they did not think of making way for us ; No. I sighed 
such a sigh! No. 2 followed, and so on, when they all sighed in chorus for our edification, while we dared not raise our eyes from the ground. That is 
the time I would have made use of a dagger. Two passed in a buggy, and trusting to our not recognizing them from the rapidity of their vehicle, kissed 
their hands to us until they were out of sight! All went back to <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> vowing <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> had the prettiest girls in the world. These were our own 
people, the elite of <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, loyal Southerners and gentlemen. These Northerners pass us satisfied with a simple glance ; some take off their hats, for all 
these officers know our name, though we may not know theirs; how, I can't say.

When I heard of Colonel McMillan's misfortune, mother conspired with me to send over some bandages, and something Tiche manufactured of flour 
under the name of "nourishment," for he is across the street at Heroman's. Miriam objected on account of what "our people" will say, and what we 
will suffer for it if the guerrillas reach town, but we persuaded her we were right. . . . You can imagine our condition at present, many years hence, Sarah, 
when you reflect that it is the brave, noble-hearted, generous Miriam who is afraid to do that deed on account of "public opinion," which indeed is "down" 
on us. At <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a> they are frantic about our returning to town, and call us traitors, Yankees, and 
vow vengeance. ... A lady said to me, "The guerrillas have a black list containing the names of those 
remaining in town. All the men are to be hanged, their houses burned, and all the women are to be tarred and feathered." I said, " Madam, if I believed 
them capable of such a vile threat, even, much less the execution, I would see them cut down without a feeling of compassion" (which is not true), "and 
swear I was a Yankee rather than claim being a native of the same country with such brutes." She has a long tongue ; when I next hear of it, it will be 
that / told the story, and called them brutes and hoped they would be shot, etc. And so goes the world. No one will think of saying that I did not 
believe them guilty of the thought, even. Our three brothers may be sick or wounded at this minute; what I do for this man, God will send some one to 
do for them, and with that belief I do it. ...
