Yesterday the General saluted us with "Young 
ladies, if you will ride in a Confederate carriage, you 
may go to dress parade this evening." Now, in 
present phraseology, " Confederate " means anything 
that is rough, unfinished, unfashionable, or poor. 
You hear of Confederate dresses, which means last 
year's. Confederate bridle means a rope halter. 
Confederate silver, a tin cup or spoon. Confederate 
flour is corn meal, etc. In this case the Confederate 
carriage is a Jersey wagon with four seats, a top of 
hickory slats covered with leather, and the whole 
drawn by mules. We accepted gladly, partly for 
the ride and sight, partly to show we were not 
ashamed of a very comfortable conveyance ; so with 
Mrs. Badger as chaperon, we went off in grand 
style. I must say I felt rather abashed and wished 
myself at home as we drove into town, and had the 
gaze of a whole regiment riveted on us. But soon 
the men fell in line, and I did not feel so painfully 
conspicuous. I was amused at a contrast near by, 
too. There was but one carriage present, besides 
ours, though there were half a dozen ladies on horse 
back. This carriage was a very fine one, and in it sat 
three of the ugliest, dowdiest, worst dressed females 
I ever saw. We three girls sat in our rough carriage 
as comfortable as could be, dressed well, we 
could not have been dressed better and looking 
our very best. <em>Sans mentir</em>, I think the Confederates were much the most respectable.

And what a sad sight the Fourth Louisiana was, 
that was then parading! Men that had fought at 
Shiloh and <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> were barefooted. Rags 
was their only uniform, for very few possessed a 
complete suit, and those few wore all varieties of 
colors and cuts. Hats could be seen of every style 
and shape, from the first ever invented down to the 
last one purchased evidently some time since. Yet 
he who had no shoes looked as happy as he who had, 
and he who had a cap had something to toss up, 
that's all.

Four or five that we knew gathered around our 
vehicle and talked to us. Mr. Heuston told me he 
heard I had been thrown, severely injured, had a 
narrow escape, etc. Was not thrown! Saddle 
turned. A few steps off we recognized Mr. Scales. 
He would stare very hard at us, and if we turned 
towards him, would look quickly the other way as 
though afraid to meet our gaze. Presently he gave us 
an opportunity, and we bowed. He came forward 
eagerly, blushing deeply, and looking very much 
pleased, and shook hands with us, and remained 
some time talking. He said he had not heard of our 
arrival, but would call as soon as possible. Mr. Talbot had joined Breckinridge.

Having seen the last of that parade, he invited us 
to see that of his sailors, which was next; but it was 
too far; so we turned off to see Colonel Breaux's, a 
mile away. His, the Thirtieth Louisiana, is a beautiful encampment on a large open common. Parade 
was almost over as we reached there, and soon the 
Colonel came to meet us. I did not look at the drill. 
I was watching the hundreds of tents it looked 
like a great many and was wondering how men 
could live in such places, and was trying to fancy 
what George's or Gibbes's looked like. It was 
pleasant to watch the barefoot soldiers race around 
like boys let loose from school, tossing caps and 
chips at two old gray geese that flew in circles 
around the encampment, just as though they had 
never had more earnest work. One gray-headed 
man stood in the door of his tent, while a black-headed young one danced before him, to his own 
whistle, with his arms akimbo. Altogether it was a 
very pretty picture ; but poor men ! how can they be 
happy in these tents?
