The last of eighteen sixty-three is passing away as I write. . . . Every New Year since I was in my 
teens, I have sought a quiet spot where I could whisper to myself Tennyson's " Death of the Old Year," 
and even this bitter cold night I steal into my freezing, fireless little room, en robe de nuit, to keep up my 
old habit while the others sleep. . . . 
</p><p>
"Old year, you shall not die; 
We did so laugh and cry with you, 
I've half a mind to die with you, 
Old year, if you must die." 
</p><p>
No! Go and welcome! Bring Peace and brighter 
days, O dawning New Year. Die, faster and faster, 
Old One; I count your remaining moments with al 
most savage glee.
