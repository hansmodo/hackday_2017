It is decided that I am to go to <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> next week. I hardly know which I dislike most, going or 
staying. I know I shall be dreadfully homesick; but- 
</p><p>
Remember and keep quiet, Sarah, I beg of 
you. Everything points to an early attack here. 
Some say this week. The Federals are cutting down 
all our beautiful woods near the Penitentiary, to 
throw up breastworks, some say. Cannon are to be 
planted on the foundation of Mr. Pike's new house; 
everybody is in a state of expectation. Honestly, if 
<a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> has to be shelled, I shall hate to miss 
the fun. It will be worth seeing, and I would like to 
be present, even at the risk of losing my big toe by 
a shell. But then, by going, I can save many of my 
clothes, and then Miriam and I can divide when every 
thing is burned that is one advantage, besides 
being beneficial by the change of air. They say the 
town is to be attacked to-night. I don't believe a 
word of it.

Oh, I was so distressed this evening! They tell me Mr. Biddle was killed at <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>. I hope it is 
not true. Suppose it was a shot from Will's battery?
