Write me down a witch, a prophetess, or what 
you will. I am certainly something! All has come 
to pass on that very disagreeable subject very much 
as I feared. Perhaps no one in my position would 
speak freely on the subject; for that very reason I 
shall not hesitate to discuss it. 
Know, then, that this morning, He went North 
along with many other Confederate prisoners, to be 
exchanged. And he left he who has written so 
incessantly and so imploringly for me to visit his 
prison he left without seeing me. Bon! Wonder 
what happened? 
</p><p>
Evening. 
</p><p>
I have learned more. He has not yet left; part of 
the mystery is unraveled, only I have neither patience nor desire to seek for more. These women ! 
Hush! to slander is too much like them; be yourself.

My sweet little lisper informed a select circle of 
friends the other night, when questioned, that the 
individual had not called on me, and, what was more, 
would not do so. "Pray, how do you happen to be 
so intimately acquainted with the affairs of two who 
are strangers to you?" asked a lady present. She 
declined saying how she had obtained her information, only asserting that it was so. "In fact, you 
cannot expect any Confederate gentleman to call at 
the house of Judge Morgan, a professed Unionist," 
she continued. So that is the story she told to keep 
him from seeing me. She has told him that we had 
turned Yankees! All her arts would not grieve me 
as much as one word against Brother. My wrongs 
I can forget; but one word of contempt for Brother I 
never forgive! White with passion I said to my informant, "Will you inform the young lady that her 
visit will never be returned, that she is requested not 
to repeat hers, and that I decline knowing any one 
who dares cast the slightest reflection on the name of 
one who has been both father and brother to me!" 
This evening I was at a house where she was announced. Miriam and I bade our hostess good evening and left without speaking to her. Anybody 
but Brother ! No one shall utter his name before me 
save with respect and regard.

This young woman's father is a Captain in the 
Yankee navy, and her brother is a Captain in the 
Yankee army, while three other brothers are in the 
Confederate. Like herself, I have three brothers 
fighting for the South ; unlike her, the only brother 
who avows himself a Unionist has too much regard 
for his family to take up arms against his own flesh 
and blood.
