Miriam and mother are going to <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> in a few hours, to see if anything can be saved from the 
general wreck. From the reports of the removal of the Penitentiary machinery, State Library, Washington Statue, etc., we presume that that part of the 
town yet standing is to be burnt like the rest. I think, though, that mother has delayed too long. 
However, I dreamed last night that we had saved a great deal, in trunks; and my dreams sometimes 
come true. Waking with that impression, I was surprised, a few hours after, to hear mother's sudden 
determination. But I also dreamed I was about to marry a Federal officer ! That was in consequence of 
having answered the question, whether I would do so, with an emphatic "Yes! if I loved him," which 
will probably ruin my reputation as a patriot in this parish. Bah! I am no bigot! or fool either. . . .
