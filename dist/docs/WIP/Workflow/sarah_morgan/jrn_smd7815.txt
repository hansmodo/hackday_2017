The cry is "Ho! for <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a>!" Very probably this day week will see us there. I don't want to go. 
If we were at peace, and were to spend a few months of the warmest season out there, none would be more 
eager and delighted than I : but to leave our comfortable home, and all it contains, for a rough pine cottage seventeen miles away even from this scanty 
civilization, is sad. It must be! We are hourly expecting two regiments of Yankees to occupy the Garrison, and some fifteen hundred of our men are awaiting them a little way off, so the fight seems inevitable. 
And we must go, leaving what little has already been 
spared us to the tender mercies of Northern volunteers, who, from the specimen of plundering they 
gave us two weeks ago, will hardly leave us even 
the shelter of our roof. O my dear Home ! How can 
I help but cry at leaving you forever? For if this 
fight occurs, never again shall I pass the threshold 
of this house, where we have been so happy and 
sad, the scene of joyous meetings and mournful 
partings, the place where we greeted each other with 
glad shouts after even so short a parting, the place 
where Harry and father kissed us good-bye and 
never came back again!

I know what Lavinia has suffered this long year, 
by what we have suffered these last six weeks. Poor Lavinia, so far away ! How easier poverty, if it must 
come, would be if we could bear it together! I wonder if the real fate of the boys, if we ever hear, can be 
so dreadful as this suspense? Still no news of them. 
My poor little Jimmy! And think how desperate Gibbes and George will be when they read Butler's 
proclamation, and they not able to defend us ! Gibbes was in our late victory of <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, I know.

In other days, going to <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a> was the signal for general noise and confusion. All the boys 
gathered their guns and fishing-tackle, and thousand 
and one amusements ; father sent out provisions ; we 
helped mother pack; Hal and I tumbled over the 
libraries to lay in a supply of reading material ; and 
all was bustle until the carriage drove to the door 
at daylight one morning, and swept us off. It is not 
so gay this time. I wandered around this morning 
selecting books alone. We can only take what is 
necessary, the rest being left to the care of the 
Northern militia in general. I never knew before how 
many articles were perfectly " indispensable" to me. 
This or that little token or keepsake, piles of letters 
I hate to burn, many dresses, etc., I cannot take 
conveniently, lie around me, and I hardly know 
which to choose among them, yet half must be 
sacrificed ; I can only take one trunk.
