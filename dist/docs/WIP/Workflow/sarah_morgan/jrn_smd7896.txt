Last night, I actually drew from Gibbes the outlines of <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Jackson's</a> campaign. He told me of some 
heroic deeds of his fellow soldiers; but of his own, not a word. I have seen his name too often in the 
papers, to believe that he has no deeds of his own to relate, if he only would.
