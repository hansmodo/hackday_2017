A letter from Lavinia has come to me all the way from California. How happy it made me, though 
written so long ago! Only the 3Oth of June! Lavinia has changed, changed. There is a sad, worn-out 
tone in every line; it sounds old, as though she had lived years and years ago and was writing as though 
she were dead and buried long since. Lavinia, whose letters used to keep me in sunshine for weeks at a 
time! Well! no wonder she is sad. All these dreary years from home, with so faint a hope of ever again 
seeing it, and all these sorrows and troubles that have befallen us, combined, are not calculated to 
make her happy. But I wish she had kept her cheerful heart. Well, perhaps it is easier for us to be 
cheerful and happy, knowing the full extent of our calamities, than it is for her, knowing so little and 
having just cause to fear so much. Courage! Better days are coming! And then I'll have many a funny 
tale to tell her of the days when the Yankees kept us on the qui vive, or made us run for our lives. It will "tell" merrily; be almost as lively as those running 
days were. One of my chief regrets over my helplessness is that I will not be able to run in the next stampede. I used to enjoy it. Oh, the days gone by, the 
dreary days, when, cut off from our own people, and surrounded by Yankees, we used to catch up any crumb of news favorable to our side that was smuggled into town, and the Brunots and I would write each other little dispatches of consolation and send them by little negroes ! Those were dismal 
days. Yet how my spirits would rise when the long roll would beat, and we would prepare for flight !
