Another odd link of the old, stale story has come 
to me, all the way from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. A friend of mine, 
who went on the same boat with the prisoners, wrote 
to her mother to tell her that she had formed the 
acquaintance of the most charming, fascinating 
gentleman among them, no other than my once 
friend. Of course, she would have been less than a 
woman if she had not gossiped when she discovered 
who he was. So she sends me word that he told her 
he had been made to believe, as long as he was on 
parole in <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, that we were all Unionists 
now, and that Brother would not allow a Confederate to enter the house. (O my little lisper, was I 
unjust to you?) He told her that I had been very 
kind to him when he was in prison, and he would 
have forgotten the rest and gladly have called to 
thank me in person for the kindness he so gratefully 
remembered, if I alone had been concerned; but he 
felt he could not force himself unasked into my 
brother's house. . . .

She told him how false it was.
