What a rush of visitors last night! One would 
imagine they had all come by appointment, expressly to have an impromptu dance, which they 
certainly enjoyed, by the way. There was little Captain C- , the Susceptible and Simple, who so innocently says "I seen" and "I done it," without 
the faintest suspicion of the peculiarity, and looks 
so sweet, and guileless, and amiable, and soft, that I 
can't help wondering if he would be sticky if I touch 
him. Indeed, I think his hands stick, at least; for 
when he told me good-bye, it was with the greatest 
difficulty that I extracted mine from his grasp (he 
having forgotten to return it during a long farewell 
address), and even when I succeeded in recovering 
it, by being almost rude, it was not released without 
a very sensible pressure from the putty, or whatever 
it is that is so tenacious. I am afraid it is rather a habit of his, which has lost all force or meaning by 
being too frequently repeated. Then there was a horrid little wretch, vulgar and underbred (to my idea) , to whom I was introduced as Mr. G 
</p><p>
But here is Lieutenant Dupre, whom I have not yet 
introduced, though we have met before. Tall, good-looking, a fine form, and not a sparkling face, I am 
inclined to believe that his chief merit lies in his legs. 
Certainly when he dances he puts his best foot for 
ward, and knows it, too. Miriam, who adores dancing, is flirting openly with this divinity of the "Deux Temps" and polka, and skims around with 
his arm about her (position sanctified by the lively 
air Lydia is dashing off on the piano) with a grace 
and lightness only equaled by his own. And Lieutenant Duggan, with his good, honest, clever face 
which so unmistakably proclaims him "Tom," we 
know already, so no further description is needed. 
Captain Fenner, too, is well known, with his short, 
though graceful figure, his good-humored, intelligent 
face, irresistible imperial, and that roguish expression about that large mouth which displays such 
handsome teeth, and seems to say, "Don't trust me too far."

Little Captain C- - tells me a long story about how Colonel Steadman had come to him and asked 
if he believed it possible that Miss Morgan had put 
her life and happiness in the hands of a homoeopathic physician; how he considered her fate sealed; and 
what a shame it was to trifle with such a sad affair, 
at my age, too, ruined for life ! It was dreadful ! Too 
sad ! Hereupon, as continuing the story, he remarks 
that being asked his opinion by the Colonel, he 
agreed perfectly and thought with him it was an 
appalling sacrifice, and oh, all sorts of things! Any 
thing, just to make me miserable and unhappy! 
</p><p>
Well, what is written will come to pass. First 
comes a doctor with a butchering apparatus who 
cups and bleeds me unmercifully, says I'll walk ten 
days after, and exit. Enter another. Croton oil and 
strychnine pills, that ll set me up in two weeks. And 
exit. Enter a third. Sounds my bones and pinches 
them from my head to my heels. Tells of the probability of a splinter of bone knocked off my left hip, 
the possibility of paralysis in the leg, the certainty 
of a seriously injured spine, and the necessity for 
the most violent counter-irritants. Follow blisters 
which sicken even disinterested people to look at, 
and a trifle of suffering which I come very near acknowledging to myself. Enter the fourth. Inhuman 
butchery ! wonder they did not kill you ! Take three 
drops a day out of this tiny bottle, and presto! in 
two weeks you are walking! A fifth, in the character 
of a friend, says, "My dear young lady, if you do, 
your case is hopeless." What wonder that I am 
puzzled? A wiser head would be confused. I want 
to believe all, but how is it possible? "What will be, 
will be."

<em>Bon!</em> here comes a note from Mr. Halsey! Ah a! Lend him "Zaidee"? Certainly! Here is a postscript 
three times the length of the note ; <em>voyons</em>. Will Miss Sarah make the annotations he requested, in "Kate 
Coventry"? He is anxious to have the lady's opinion on the questions of taste and propriety which so 
frequently occur in the book. ... I'll not attempt such a display; yet there are several passages I am 
dying to mark. One in particular, speaking of the peculiarities of men, of how they are always more at 
ease when they have their hands employed, drawing confidence and conversation from a paper-knife and 
book to tumble, a pair of scissors and a thread to snip, or even from imbibing the head of a cane, I am 
anxious to call his attention to. If I dared add to the list, "or a cord and tassel to play with"! This 
nervous Mr. Halsey is wearing out my pretty blue tassel that Frank admires so much; he says he can 
talk better when he dangles it. Think the hint might save it in the future!
