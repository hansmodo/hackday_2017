DOOMED to be bored! To-night Miriam drags me 
to a soiree musicale, and in the midst of my toilet, I 
sit down with bare shoulders to scratch a dozen lines 
in my new treasure which has been by me for three 
days, untouched. I don't know what tempts me to 
do it except perversity ; for I have nothing to say.

I was in hopes that I would never have occasion to 
refer to the disagreeable subject that occupied the 
last pages of my old journal, but the hope proves 
fallacious, and wherever I turn, the same subject is 
renewed. So there is no longer any reason in waiting 
until all mention can be avoided. Yesterday a little, 
sly, snaky creature asked me if I knew "the Hero of 
Port Hudson." "Yes," I said briefly. "Unmistakable! I see it in your face!" she remarked. "See 
what?" "That you betray yourself. Do you know 
that every one believes that you are engaged to 
him?" In surprise I said no; such a thing had never 
been mentioned before me until then. "Well! they 
say so, and add, too, that you are to be married as 
soon as the war is over." They are paying me an 
undeserved compliment," I returned. Where could 
such a report have originated? Not certainly from 
him, and not, most assuredly, from me. Where does 
Dame rumor spring from? He is a stranger here, and 
I have never mentioned his name except to the Peirces, 
who would no more report such a thing than I would 
myself. I won't mind it if it does not reach his ears; 
but what assurance have I that it will not? That 
would be unpleasant! Why can't "they say" let 
everybody settle their own affairs? 
</p><p>
Here comes Miriam after me! What a bore! 
What a bore! And she looks as though it was a 
pleasure to go out! How I hate it! 
</p><p>
Glancing up the page, the date strikes my eye. 
What tempted me to begin it Friday? My dear Ada 
would shiver and declare the blank pages were 
reserved for some very painful, awful, uncomfortable record, or that "something" would happen 
before the end of it. Nothing very exciting can 
happen, except the restoration of peace; and to 
bring that about, I would make a vow to write only 
on Fridays.
