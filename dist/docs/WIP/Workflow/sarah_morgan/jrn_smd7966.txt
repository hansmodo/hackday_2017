I hope this will be the last occasion on which I 
shall refer to the topic to which this unfortunate 
book seems to have been devoted. But it gives me a 
grim pleasure to add a link to the broken chain of the 
curious story, now and then. Maybe some day the 
missing links will be supplied me, and then I can 
read the little humdrum romance of What might 
have been, or What I'm glad never was, as easily as 
Marie tells her rosary.

Well! the prisoners have gone at last, to my 
unspeakable satisfaction. Day before yesterday they 
left. Now I can go out as I please, without fear of 
meeting him face to face. How odd that I should feel 
like a culprit! But that is in accordance with my 
usual judgment and consistency. Friday, I had a 
severe fright. Coming up Camp Street with Ada, 
after a ramble on Canal, we met two Confederates. 
Everywhere that morning we had met gray coats, 
but none that I recognized. Still, without looking, 
I saw through my eyelids, as it were, two hands 
timidly touch two gray caps, as though the question 
"May I?" had not yet been answered. In vain I 
endeavored to meet their eyes, or give the faintest 
token of greeting. I was too frightened and embarrassed to speak, and only by a desperate effort succeeded in bending my head in a doubtful bow, that 
would have disgraced a dairy maid, after we had 
passed. Then, disgusted with myself, I endeavored 
to be comforted with the idea that they had perhaps 
mistaken me for some one else; that having known 
me at a time when I was unable to walk, they could 
have no idea of my height and figure, or walk. So I 
reasoned, turning down a side street. Lo! at a respectable distance they were following! We had 
occasion to go into a daguerreau salon. While 
standing in the light, two gray uniforms, watching 
us from the dark recess at the door, attracted my 
attention. Pointing them out to Ada, I hurried her 
past them downstairs to the street. Faster and faster 
we walked, until at the corner I turned to look. 
There they were again, sauntering leisurely along. 
We turned into another street, mingled in the 
crowd, and finally lost sight of them. That fright 
lasted me an hour or two. Whose purse have I 
stolen, that I am afraid to look these men in the 
face? 
</p><p>
But what has this to do with what I meant to tell? 
How loosely and disconnectedly my ideas run out 
with the ink from my pen ! I meant to say how sorry 
I am for my dear little lisper that she failed in her 
efforts to conquer the "Hero"; and here I have 
drifted off in a page of trash that does not concern 
her in the least. Well ! she did not succeed, and what 
ever she told him was told in vain, as far as she was 
concerned. He was not to be caught! What an 
extraordinary man! Dozens fighting for the preference, and he in real, or pretended ignorance.

I must do him the justice to say he is the most 
guileless, as well as the most honest of mortals. He 
told the mother of a rich and pretty daughter what 
he thought of me ; that my superior did not exist on 
earth, and my equal he had never met. Ha! ha! this 
pathetic story makes me laugh in spite of myself. Is 
it excess of innocence, or just a r√¥le he adopted? 
Stop! His idle word is as good as an oath. He could 
not pretend to what he did not believe. He told her 
of his earnest and sincere admiration words ! 
words! hurry on! She asked how it was then ? 
Here he confessed, with a mixture of pride and penitence, that he had written me letters which absolutely required answers, and to which I had never 
deigned to reply by even a word. That, mortified 
beyond measure at my silent contempt, he had 
tried every means of ascertaining the cause of my 
coldness, but I had never vouchsafed an answer, 
but had left him to feel the full force of my harsh 
treatment without one word of explanation. That 
when he was paroled, he had hoped that I would see 
him to tell him wherein he had forfeited my esteem ; 
but I had not invited him to call, and mortified and 
repulsed as he had been, it was impossible for him to 
call without my permission. . . . Did my little lisper 
change the message when the little midshipman told 
her it had been intercepted because too friendly? I 
know she met this martyred Lion frequently after 
that and had many opportunities of telling him the 
simple truth, but she evidently did not. 
</p><p>
He has gone away with sorely wounded feelings, 
to say nothing more; for that I am sincerely sorry; 
but I trust to his newly acquired freedom, and his 
life of danger and excitement, to make him forget 
the wrongs he believes himself to have suffered at 
my hands. If it was all to be gone through again 
(which thank Heaven, I will never be called upon to 
endure again), I would follow Brother's advice as 
implicitly then as I did before. He is right, and 
without seeing, I believe. They tell me of his altered 
looks, and of his forced, reckless gaiety which, so 
strangely out of keeping with his natural character, 
but makes his assumed part more conspicuous. No 
matter ! He will recover ! Nothing like a sea voyage 
for disorders of all kinds. And we will never meet 
again ; that is another consolation.

"Notice: The public are hereby informed through Mrs. - , Chief Manager of the Theatre of High 
Tragedy, that Miss Sarah M., having been proved unworthy and incompetent to play the role of 
Ariadne, said part will hereafter be filled by Miss Blank, of Blank Street, who plays it with a fidelity 
so true to nature that she could hardly be surpassed by the original."
