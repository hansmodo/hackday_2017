Last night about one o'clock I was wakened and 
told that mother and Miriam had come. Oh, how 
glad I was! I tumbled out of bed half asleep and 
hugged Miriam in a dream, but waked up when I got 
to mother. They came up under a flag of truce, on 
a boat going up for provisions, which, by the way, 
was brought to by half a dozen Yankee ships in succession, with a threat to send a broadside into her 
if she did not stop the wretches knew it must be 
under a flag of truce ; no boats leave, except by special 
order to procure provisions. 
</p><p>
What tales they had to tell! They were on the 
wharf, and saw the ships sail up the river, saw the 
broadside fired into Will Pinckney's regiment, the 
boats we fired, our gunboats, floating down to meet 
them all wrapped in flames; twenty thousand bales 
of cotton blazing in a single pile ; molasses and sugar 
thrown over everything. They stood there opposite 
to where one of the ships landed, expecting a broad 
side, and resolute not to be shot in the back. I wish 
I had been there ! And Captain Huger is not dead ! 
They had hopes of his life for the first time day be 
fore yesterday. Miriam saw the ball that had just 
been extracted. He will probably be lame for the 
rest of his life. It will be a glory to him. For even 
the Federal officers say that never did they see so 
gallant a little ship, or one that fought so desperately 
as the McRae. Men and officers fought like devils. 
Think of all those great leviathans after the poor 
little Widow Mickey ! One came tearing down on 
her sideways, while the Brooklyn fired on her from 
the other side, when brave Captain Warley put the 
nose of the Manassas under the first, and tilted her 
over so that the whole broadside passed over, in 
stead of through, the McRae, who spit back its poor 
little fire at both. And after all was lost, she carried 
the wounded and the prisoners to <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, and 
was scuttled by her own men in port. Glorious 
Captain Huger! And think of his sending word to 
Jimmy, suffering as he was, that "his little brass 
cannon was game to the last." Oh! I hope he will 
recover. Brave, dare-devil Captain Warley is prisoner, and on the way to Fort Warren, that home 
of all brave, patriotic men. We ll have him out. 
And my poor little Jimmy! If I have not spoken of 
him, it is not because I have lost sight of him for a 
moment. The day the McRae went down, he arose 
from his bed, ill as he was, and determined to rejoin 
her, as his own boat, the Mississippi, was not ready. 
When he reached the St. Charles, he fell so very ill 
that he had to be carried back to Brother's. Only 
his desperate illness saved him from being among the 
killed or wounded on that gallant little ship. A few 
days after, he learned the fate of the ship, and was 
told that Captain Huger was dead. No wonder he 
should cry so bitterly! For Captain Huger was as 
tender and as kind to him as his own dear father. 
God bless him for it ! The enemy's ships were sailing 
up; so he threw a few articles in a carpet-bag and 
started off for <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, Corinth, anywhere, to 
fight. Sick, weak, hardly able to stand, he went off, 
two weeks ago yesterday. We know not where, and 
we have never heard from him since. Whether he 
succumbed to that jaundice and the rest, and lies 
dead or dying on the road, God only knows. We can 
only wait and pray God to send dear little Jimmy 
home in safety.

And this is WAR! Heaven save me from like 
scenes and experiences again. I was wild with excitement last night when Miriam described how the 
soldiers, marching to the depot, waved their hats to 
the crowds of women and children, shouting, "God 
bless you, ladies! We will fight for you!" and they, 
waving their handkerchiefs, sobbed with one voice, 
"God bless you, Soldiers! Fight for us!" 
</p><p>
We, too, have been having our fun. Early in the 
evening, four more gunboats sailed up here. We saw 
them from the corner, three squares off, crowded with 
men even up in the riggings. The American flag was 
flying from every peak. It was received in profound 
silence, by the hundreds gathered on the banks. I 
could hardly refrain from a groan. Much as I once 
loved that flag, I hate it now ! I came back and made 
myself a Confederate flag about five inches long, 
slipped the staff in my belt, pinned the flag to my 
shoulder, and walked downtown, to the consternation of women and children, who expected something 
awful to follow. An old negro cried, "My young missus got her flag flyin , anyhow!" Nettie made 
one and hid it in the folds of her dress. But we were 
the only two who ventured. We went to the State 
House terrace, and took a good look at the Brooklyn 
which was crowded with people who took a good 
look at us, likewise. The picket stationed at the 
Garrison took alarm at half a dozen men on horse 
back and ran, saying that the citizens were attack 
ing. The kind officers aboard the ship sent us word 
that if they were molested, the town would be 
shelled. Let them! Butchers! Does it take thirty 
thousand men and millions of dollars to murder 
defenseless women and children? O the great nation!

Bravo !
