A proclamation of Van Dorn has just been smuggled into town, that advises all persons living with 
in eight miles of the Mississippi to remove into the interior, as he is determined to defend his department at all hazards to the last extremity. Does not 
look like the Peace I have been deluding myself with, does it? That means another Exodus. How are 
we to leave, when we are not allowed to pass the 
limits of the corporation by the Federals? Where are 
we to go? We are between the two armies, and here 
we must remain patiently awaiting the result. Some 
of these dark nights, bang! we will hear the cannon, 
and then it will be sauve qui peut in a shower of shells. 
Bah ! I don't believe God will suffer that we should 
be murdered in such a dreadful way ! I don't believe 
He will suffer us to be turned homeless and naked on 
the world ! " Something will turn up " before we are 
attacked, and we will be spared, I am certain. We can't look forward more than an hour at a time now, 
sometimes not a minute ahead (witness the shelling frolic), so I must resume my old habit of laying a 
clean dress on my bed before going to sleep, which I did every night for six weeks before the shelling of 
<a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, in order to run respectably, as muslin cross-bar nightgowns are not suitable for day dresses.

I am afraid I shall be nervous when the moment of the bombardment actually arrives. This suspense 
is not calculated to soothe one's nerves. A few moments since, a salute was fired in honor of General Butler's arrival, when women, children, and servants 
rushed to the front of the houses, confident of a repetition of the shelling which occurred a month ago 
to-day. The children have not forgotten the scene, 
for they all actually howled with fear. Poor little 
Sarah stopped her screams to say, " Mother, don't 
you wish we was dogs stead o white folks?" in such 
piteous accents that we had to laugh. don't I 
wish I was a dog! Sarah is right. I don't know if I 
showed my uneasiness a while ago, but certainly my 
heart has hardly yet ceased beating rather rapidly. 
If I knew what moment to expect the stampede, I 
would not mind ; but this way to expect it every 
instant it is too much ! Again, if I knew where we 
could go for refuge from the shells !

A window banging unexpectedly just then gave 
me a curious twinge; not that I thought it was the 
signal, oh, dear, no! I just thought what, I wonder? Pshaw! "Picayune Butler's coming, coming" 
has upset my nervous system. He interrupted me in 
the middle of my arithmetic; and I have not the 
energy to resume my studies. I shall try what effect 
an hour's practice will have on my spirits, and will 
see that I have a pair of clean stockings in my 
stampede sack, and that the fastenings of my "running-bag" are safe. Though if I expect to take either, 
I should keep in harness constantly. How long, O Lord! how long?
