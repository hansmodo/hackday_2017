A profitable way to spend such a day! Being 
forced to dispense with church-going, I have occupied myself in reading a great deal, and writing a 
little, which latter duty is a favorite task of mine after church on Sundays. But this evening, the 
mosquitoes are so savage that writing became impossible, until Miriam and I instituted a grand extermination process, which we partly accomplished by extraordinary efforts. She lay on the bed with 
the bar half-drawn over her, and half-looped up, while I was commissioned to fan the wretches from 
all corners into the pen. It was rather fatiguing, and in spite of the numbers slain, hardly recompensed 
me for the trouble of hunting them around the room ; but still, Miriam says exercise is good for me, and she ought to know.

I have been reading that old disguster, Boswell. Bah ! I have no patience with the toady ! I suppose 
"my mind is not yet thoroughly impregnated with the Johnsonian ether," and that is the reason why 
I cannot appreciate him, or his work. I admire him 
for his patience and minuteness in compiling such 
trivial details. He must have been an amiable man, 
to bear Johnson's brutal, ill-humored remarks; but 
seems to me if I had not spirit enough to resent the 
indignity, I would at least not publish it to the world ! 
Briefly, my opinion, which this book has only tended 
to confirm, is that Boswell was a vain, conceited 
prig, a fool of a jackanape, an insupportable sycophant, a whatever mean thing you please; there 
is no word small enough to suit him. As to Johnson, 
he is a surly old bear; in short, an old brute of a 
tyrant. All his knowledge and attainments could 
not have made me tolerate him, I am sure. I could 
have no respect for a man who was so coarse in 
speech and manners, and who eat like an animal. 
Fact is, I am not a Boswellian, or a Johnsonian, 
either. I do not think him such an extraordinary 
man. I have heard many conversations as worthy 
of being recorded as nineteen-twentieths of his. In 
spite of his learning, he was narrow-minded and 
bigoted, which I despise above all earthly failings. 
Witness his tirades against Americans, calling us 
Rascals, Robbers, Pirates, and saying he would like 
to burn us ! Now I have railed at many of these ordinary women here, for using like epithets for the 
Yankees, and have felt the greatest contempt for their absurd abuse. These poor women do not aspire to Johnsonian wisdom, and their ignorance 
may serve as an excuse for their narrow-mindedness ; but the wondrous Johnson to rave and bellow like any Billingsgate nymph! Bah! He is an old disguster!
