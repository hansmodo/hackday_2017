Just after sunset yesterday, Anna and I were 
walking down the road towards the sugar-house, she 
reading occasionally from Abbott's "Napoleon," 
and then pausing for me to explain the very difficult 
passages she could not understand, when we suddenly became aware of the approach of a horse, and 
raising our bowed heads, beheld Colonel Breaux and 
another before us, to our infinite surprise and astonishment. The Colonel sprang from his horse and 
advanced on foot ; his companion slowly followed his 
example, and was introduced as Captain Morrison. 
We adjourned our historical fit for some future 
period, and walked home with the gentlemen. 
Miriam did not get back from her excursion to the 
cane-patch until it was quite late ; when after sitting 
down a few moments, she ran upstairs to change her 
dress. She had just put it on an hour before, but 
nothing would do but she must dress up fine ; so she 
put on her handsomest organdie. In vain 1 pointed 
to my simple pink muslin with a white body that I 
had worn all day, and begged she would not make 
the contrast between us more striking than ever, as 
I felt I could not change it without exciting remark. 
She was obdurate ; dressed herself in gorgeous array, 
and, as usual, I looked like her lady's maid.

Colonel Breaux paid my hair the most extravagant compliments. He said he could not say his 
prayers for looking at it in church, Sunday before 
last. Perhaps that is the reason St. Paul said a 
woman should not worship in church with her head 
uncovered ! But as the Yankees stole my bonnet, I 
am reduced to wearing my black straw walking-hat 
with its curled brim, trimmed in black ribbon with 
golden sheaves of wheat. Two years ago this fall, 
father threw me a banknote at table, and I purchased this with it. Now it is my only headgear, 
except a sunbonnet. Before leaving, which was not 
until quite late, this evening was named for our 
ride to the fortifications, to our infinite delight, as 
we have dreamed and talked of nothing else for a week. . . .

A dispatch just received from Gibbes, from Mobile, on his way home. I am so happy ! But what 
can bring him? I fear - Lydia has gone to <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> to meet him at Lilly's.
