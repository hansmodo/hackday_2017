Once more a cripple and consigned to my bed, for 
how long, Heaven only knows. This is written while 
in a horizontal position, reposing on my right arm, 
which is almost numb from having supported me for 
some sixteen hours without turning over. Let me 
see if I can remember how it happened. 
</p><p>
Last evening we started out to see Gibbes, just Miriam and Anna in one buggy, and Mrs. Badger 
and I in the other. Gibbes proper, that is, the Captain, and the General both approved, but neither 
could accompany us. It is useless to say how much 
I objected to going without a gentleman. Indeed, 
when we reached the road which formed the fourth 
side of the square formed by Colonel Breaux's, 
Captain Bradford's, and Captain Fenner's camps, 
I thought I should die of terror on finding myself 
in such a crowd of soldiers on parade. My thick veil alone consoled me, but I made a vow that I 
would not go through it again, not if I never saw Gibbes, Jr., again on earth. 
</p><p>
His camp lay far off from the road, so that we had 
to drive out to it between the other two, and asked a 
soldier to tell him that we were there. Presently he 
came up, looking so pleased that I was almost glad 
that we had come; and then Captain Fenner appeared, looking charmed, and Lieutenant Harris, 
who looked more alarmed and timid than I. Captain Fenner exerted himself to entertain us, and 
seeing how frightened I was, assured me that it was 
an everyday occurrence for young ladies to visit 
them in parties without gentlemen, and that it was 
done all through the Confederacy; which, however, 
did not comfort me for the hundreds of eyes that 
were looking at us as our small party stood out in 
front of the encampment around a cannon. I think 
he can throw more expression into his eyes than any 
one I ever saw. Miriam suggested sending Gibbes 
to the Provost to get our pass in order to avoid the 
crowd that might be there. Eager to leave the present one for a more retired spot, I exclaimed, "Oh, 
no! let us go ourselves! We can't get in a worse 
crowd!" I meant a greater; but Captain Fenner 
looked so comically at me that I could scarcely 
laugh out an apology, while he laughed so that I am 
sure he did not listen to me. What a comical 
mouth ! I liked him very much, this time. He promised to come out to-day or to-morrow, and have a 
game of " Puss wants a corner" in the sugar-house. But now I can't join in, though it was to me the promise was made. 
</p><p>
But to the catastrophe at once. 
</p><p>
As we left, we insisted on taking Gibbes to get 
our pass, and made him get into Miriam's buggy, 
where there was space for him to kneel and drive. 
I was to carry out my promise to Mr. Enders. We 
had to pass just by the camp of the First Alabama, 
Colonel Steadman's, where the whole regiment was 
on parade. We had not gone thirty yards beyond 
them when a gun was discharged. The horse 
instantly ran off. I don't believe there could be two 
cooler individuals than Mrs. Badger and I were. 
I had every confidence in her being able to hold him 
so long as the bridle lasted. I had heard that there 
was more danger in jumping at such moments than 
in remaining quiet, so I sat still. There was nothing 
to hold to, as it was a no- top, or what I call a " lowneck," buggy ; so my hands rested quietly in my lap. 
Presently I saw the left rein snap close to the horse's 
mouth. I knew all was over then, but did not utter 
a word. Death seemed inevitable, and I thought it 
was as well to take it coolly. The horse turned 
abruptly; I felt that something impelled me out, 
followed the impulse, saw Mrs. Badger's white cape 
fluttering above me, received a blow on the extremity of my spine that I thought would kill me before 
I reached the ground, landing, however, on my left 
hip, and quietly reclining on my left elbow, with my 
face to an upset buggy whose wheels spun around 
in empty air. I heard a rush as of horses ; I saw men 
galloping up; I would have given worlds to spring 
to my feet, or even to see if they were exposed ; but 
found I could not move. I had no more power over 
my limbs than if they were iron; only the intense 
pain told me I was still alive. I was perfectly conscious, but unable to move. My only wonder was 
why Miriam, who was in front, did not come to me. 
My arm was giving away. Dimly, as through a 
haze, or dream, I saw a soldier bending over me, 
trying to raise me. The horse he had sprung from 
rushed up to his master, and reared up over me. 
I saw the iron hoofs shining above my body ; death 
was certain this time, but I could not move. He 
raised his arm and struck him, and obedient to the 
blow the animal turned aside and let his feet fall 
without crushing me. Mrs. Carter, when she heard 
it described, offered a fabulous sum for a correct 
drawing of that most interesting tableau, the gallant Alabamian supporting a helpless form on one 
arm, while he reined in a fiery charger with the 
other. I was not aware of the romance ; I was conscious only of the unpleasant situation. 
</p><p>
Dozens crowded around, and if I had been a girl 
for display, here was an opportunity, for thirty pair 
of soldier arms were stretched out to hold me. " No ! Gibbes! Gibbes!" I whispered, and had the satisfaction of being transferred from a stranger's to my 
cousin's arms. Gibbes trembled more than I, but with both arms clasped around me, held me up. 
But for that I would have returned to my original 
horizontal position. "Send for the doctor!" cried 
one. "A surgeon, quick!" cried another. "Tell 
them no!" I motioned. I was conscious of a clatter 
of hoofs and cloud of dust. One performed a feat 
never heard of before. He brought a glass of water 
at full gallop which I instantly drained by way of 
acknowledgment. I think I felt the unpleasant 
situation more than the pain. Not being accustomed 
to being the centre of attraction, I was by no means 
pleased with the novel experience. Miriam held my 
hand, and questioned me with a voice tremulous 
with fear and laughter. Anna convulsively sobbed 
or giggled some question. I felt the ridiculous position as much as they. Laughing was agony, but I 
had to do it to give them an excuse, which they readily seized to give vent to their feelings, and encouraged by seeing it, several gold-band officers joined 
in, constantly endeavoring to apologize or check 
themselves with a "Really, Miss, it may seem 
unfeeling, but it is impossible" the rest was lost 
in a gasp, and a wrestle between politeness and the 
desire to laugh. 
</p><p>
I don't know what I was thinking of, but I certainly paid very little attention to what was going 
on. I only wanted to get home, away from all those 
eyes; and my most earnest wish made me forget 
them. The first remark I heard was my young 
Alabamian crying, "It is the most beautiful somerset I ever saw! Indeed, it could not be more grace 
fully done! Your feet did not show!" Naif, but 
it was just what I wanted to know, and dared not 
ask. Some one ran up, and asked who was hurt, 
and I heard another reply, "I am afraid the young 
lady is seriously injured, only she won't acknowledge 
it. It is worth while looking at her. She is the coolest, most dignified girl you ever saw"; and another 
was added to the already too numerous audience. 
Poor Mrs. Badger, having suffered only from torn 
clothing, received very little sympathy, while I got 
more than my share. I really believe that the blow 
I received was from her two hundred and forty 
pound body, though the Alabamian declares he saw 
the overturning buggy strike me as I fell. 
</p><p>
To her and others I am indebted for the repetition of many a remark that escaped me. One bold 
soldier boy exclaimed, "Madame, we are all warriors, but we can't equal that! It is braver than any 
man!" I had to laugh occasionally to keep my spirits up, but Miriam ordered me to quit, saying 
that I would go off in hysterics. I had previously repeatedly declared to the Doctor that I was not 
hurt, and seeing him idle, and hearing Miriam's remark, the Alabamian I am told cried, "O Doctor! Doctor! can't you do something? Is she 
going to have hysterics?" "Really," said the Doctor, "the young lady objects to being examined; 
but as far as I can judge, she has no limbs broken." Everybody ordered me to confess at once my injury; but how was I to inform a whole crowd that 
I had probably broken the tip of my backbone, and could not possibly sit down? So I adhered to my 
first affirmation, and made no objection when they piled the cushions up and made Gibbes put me down ; for I knew he must be tired. 
</p><p>
I am told I remained there an hour. I know they 
talked to me, and that I answered; but have not 
an idea of the subject. A gentleman brought a 
buggy, and offered to drive me home; but a Captain Lenair insisted on running after the ambulance. 
Arrived there, Mr. Enders says he rushed in, crying, 
" For God's sake, General Beale, lend me the ambulance! There is a dreadful accident, and I am afraid 
the young lady will die ! " Coming back he exclaimed, 
"By Jove! boys, if you want to see a sight, run 
down and see her hair! The prettiest auburn (?) 
you ever looked at, and sweeps the ground! I 
wouldn't mind such a fall if I had such hair to show. 
Come look at it, do!" Mr. Enders says he was sure 
that it was I, as soon as hair was mentioned, and 
started out as soon as he had finished a duty he had 
to perform. My garter, a purple silk ribbon, lay 
in the centre of the ring. By the respectful silence 
observed, I saw they recognized its use, so, unwilling to leave such a relic behind, I asked aloud for 
my "ribbon," whereupon Anna says the officers 
pinched each other and smiled. Up came the ambulance, and I was in imminent danger of being 
carried to it, when with a desperate effort I regained 
my feet with Gibbes's help, and reached it without 
other assistance. Beyond, I could do no more. 
</p><p>
Captain Lenair got inside, and several others 
lifted me up to him, and I sank motionless on the 
floor. All bade me good-bye, and my little Alabamian assured me that he was proud of having been 
the first to assist me. President Miller whispered 
to Mrs. Badger for permission to accompany us, 
which she readily granted, and raising me on the 
seat, he insisted on putting his arm around me to 
hold me up. It was useless to decline. "Now, Miss 
Morgan, I assure you I am an old married man! 
I know you are suffering! Let me have my way!" 
and the kind old gentleman held me so comfortably, 
and broke the force of so many jolts, that I was 
forced to submit and acknowledge that had it not 
been for him I could not have endured the rough 
road. At the gate that leads to General Beale's 
headquarters, I saw half a dozen figures standing. 
One was Frank Enders, who hailed the driver. 
"Hush!" said one I recognized as Captain Lenair. 
"The young lady is in there, and the Provost, too! " 
" I don't care if it is <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel=''>Jeff Davis</a>, I'll find out if she is 
hurt!" he answered. Miriam and Anna recognized 
him, as they followed behind us, and called to him. 
Without more ado, he jumped into their buggy, finding them alone, and drove them home. He asked 
me something as he passed, but I could not answer. 
</p><p>
The road was dreadful. Once the driver mistook 
it and drove us within two steps of an embankment 
six feet high, but discovered the mistake before the 
horses went over. 
</p><p>
What I most dreaded was explanations when we 
should arrive. Miriam stepped out an instant 
before, and I heard her telling the accident. Then 
everybody, big and little, white and black, gathered 
around the ambulance. The Provost thought him 
self privileged to carry me, Gibbes insisted on trying it with his one arm, when the General picked me 
up and landed me on the gallery. He wanted me 
to lie down in old Mrs. Carter's room, but confident 
that once there I could not get up, and feeling that 
perhaps the gentlemen would take advantage of its 
being on the ground floor to suggest calling on me, 
I struggled upstairs with Helen's assistance. A 
dozen hands undressed me, and laid me on my face 
in bed, which position I have occupied up to the 
present, 3 P.M. . . . Unable to turn, all night I lay 
awake, lying on my face, the least comfortable of 
positions; but though the slightest motion tortured 
me, I had to laugh as we talked it over. 
</p><p>
Of course, this has been written in scratches, and in my same position, which will account for many 
blots. This morning I was interrupted by mother's 
unexpected arrival, she having come with Dellie 
and Morgan to spend the day. Of course, she is 
horrified at the accident of that "unfortunate Sarah"!
