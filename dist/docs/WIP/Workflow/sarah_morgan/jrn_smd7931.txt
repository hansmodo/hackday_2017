Here goes! News has been received that the Yankees are already packed, ready to march against us at any hour. If I was up and well, how my heart 
would swell with exultation. As it is, it throbs so with excitement that I can scarcely lie still. Hope amounts almost to presumption at Port Hudson. 
They are confident that our fifteen thousand can repulse twice the number. Great God! I say it with all reverence if we could defeat them! <em>If</em> we 
could scatter, capture, annihilate them! My heart beats but one prayer Victory! I shall grow wild 
repeating it. In the mean time, though, <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> is 
in danger. This dear place, my second home; its loved inhabitants; think of their being in such peril ! Oh, I shall cry heartily if harm comes to them! But 
I must leave before. No use of leaving my bones for the Yankees to pick; better sing " Dixie " in Georgia. 
To-morrow, consequently, I go to that earthly paradise, <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, thence to be re-shipped (so goes the 
present programme) to <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> in three days. And 
no time for adieux! Wonder who will be surprised, who vexed, and who will cry over the unforeseen 
separation? Not a single " good-bye"! Nothing - except an old brass button that Mr. Halsey gave me 
as a souvenir in case he should be killed in the coming assault. It is too bad. Ah! Destiny! Destiny! 
Where do you take us? During these two trying years, I have learned to feel myself a mere puppet 
in the hands of a Something that takes me here to-day, to-morrow there, always unexpectedly, and 
generally very unwillingly, but at last leads me somewhere or other, right side up with care, after 
a thousand troubles and distresses. The hand of Destiny is on me now; where will it lead me?
