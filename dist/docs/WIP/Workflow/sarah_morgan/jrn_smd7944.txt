Ah ! another delightful glimpse of society has been offered to our charmed view. Such a treat has not often fallen to our lot. Good Mrs. Greyson, in her 
anxiety to make all around her happy, determined we should have a dance. I should say "Miriam"; for Mrs. Bull and Mrs. Ivy never indulge in such 
amusements, and I can't; so it must have been for Miriam alone. Such a crew! The two ladies above 
mentioned and I almost laughed ourselves into hysterics. Poor Miriam, with a tall, slender Texan who 
looked as though he had chopped wood all his life, moved through the dance like the lady in "Comus" ; 
only, now and then a burst of laughter at the odd mistakes threatened to overcome her dignity. We 
who were fortunately exempt from the ordeal, laughed unrestrainedly at the melee. One danced 
entirely with his arms ; his feet had very little to do with the time. One hopped through with a most 
dolorous expression of intense absorption in the arduous task. Another never changed a benign smile 
that had appeared on entering, but preserved it unimpaired through every accident. One female, 
apparently of the tender age of thirty, wore a yellow muslin, with her hair combed rigidly d la chinoise, 
and tightly fastened at the back of her head in a knot whose circumference must have been fully equal to 
that of a dollar. In addition to other charms, she bore her neck and chin in a very peculiar manner, as 
though she were looking over the fence, Mr. Christmas remarked. Mr. Christmas had ridden all the way 
from Ponchatoula to see us, and if it had not been for him, Mr. Worthington, and Dr. Capdevielle, who 
came in after a while, I think I should have expired, and even Miriam would have given up in despair. 
The Doctor was an old friend of Harry's, though we never met him before.
