I was interrupted yesterday morning by Mrs. Badger, who wished to apply a few dry cups to my 
back, to which I quietly submitted, and was unable to move afterwards without pain, as a reward for 
my patience. But towards sunset came two dear letters that made me forget what I had suffered, one 
from George, and one from Jimmy, dated Bermudas. For the first time I know what my dear little brother 
suffered during those long months when we could not hear if he were dead or alive. He kept the secret 
until he no longer needed either friends or money; and now he tells it with a simplicity that made me 
cry fit to break my heart when I was left alone in the twilight with no one to see. . . . George comforts me 
with hopes of Peace, and a speedy return. If it could only be! ...

This morning the boom of Yankee guns reached 
my ears ; a sound I had hoped never to hear again. 
It is only those poor devils (I can afford to pity 
them in their fallen state) banging away at some 
treasonable sugar-houses that are disobedient 
enough to grind cane on the other side of the 
river. I hear that one is at Mrs. Cain's. The 
sound made my heart throb. What if the fight 
should come off before I can walk? It takes three 
people to raise me whenever it is necessary for me 
to move; I am worse than helpless.
