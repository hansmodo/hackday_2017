I preach patience; but how about practice? I am 
exasperated ! there is the simple fact. And is it not 
enough? What a scene I have just witnessed! A 
motley crew of thousands of low people of all colors 
parading the streets with flags, torches, music, and 
all other accompaniments, shouting, screaming, exulting over the fall of Port Hudson and <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>. 
The "Era" will call it an enthusiastic demonstration 
of the loyal citizens of the city; we who saw it from 
upper balconies know of what rank these "citizens" 
were. We saw crowds of soldiers mixed up with the 
lowest rabble in the town, workingmen in dirty 
clothes, newsboys, ragged children, negroes, and even 
women walking in the procession, while swarms of 
negroes and low white women elbowed each other in 
a dense mass on the pavement. To see such creatures exulting over our misfortune was enough to 
make one scream with rage. One of their dozen transparencies was inscribed with "A dead Confederacy." 
Fools ! The flames are smouldering ! They will burst 
out presently and consume you! More than half, 
much more, were negroes. As they passed here they 
raised a yell of "Down with the rebels!" that made 
us gnash our teeth in silence. The Devil possessed 
me. "O Miriam, help me pray the dear Lord that 
their flag may burn!" I whispered as the torches 
danced around it. And we did pray earnestly so 
earnestly that Miriam's eyes were tightly screwed 
up; but it must have been a wicked prayer, for it 
was not answered.

Dr.'s has out a magnificent display of black cotton grammatically inscribed with " Port Hudson 
and <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a> is ours," garnished with a luminous 
row of tapers, and, drunk on two bits worth of lager 
beer, he has been shrieking out all Union songs he 
can think of with his horrid children until my tympanum is perfectly cracked. Miriam wants to offer 
him an extra bottle of lager for the two places of 
which he claims the monopoly. He would sell his 
creed for less. Miriam is dying to ask him what he 
has done with the Confederate uniform he sported 
before the Yankees came. His son says they are all 
Union men over there, and will "lemonate" (illuminate) to-night. A starving seamstress opposite has 
stuck six tallow candles in her window ; better put 
them in her stomach!

And I won't believe <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a> has surrendered) Port Hudson I am sure has fallen. Alas, for all hopes 
of serving the brave creatures ! the rumor is that they have been released on parole. Happily for them; but 
if it must go, what a blessed privilege it would have been to aid or comfort them !
