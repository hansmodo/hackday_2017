Was not the recollection of this day bitter enough 
to me already? I did not think it could be more so. 
Yet behold me crying as I have not cried for many 
and many a day. Not for Harry; I dare not cry for 
him. I feel a deathlike quiet when I think of him; 
a fear that even a deep-drawn breath would wake 
him in his grave. And as dearly as I love you, O Hal, 
I don't want you in this dreary world again. . . .

Talk of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes! 
Talk of Louis XI V ! Of pshaw ! my head is in such 
a whirl that history gets all mixed up, and all parallels seem weak and moderate in comparison to this 
infamous outrage. To-day, thousands of families, 
from the most respectable down to the least, all who 
have had the firmness to register themselves enemies 
to the United States, are ordered to leave the city 
before the fifteenth of May. Think of the thousands, 
perfectly destitute, who can hardly afford to buy 
their daily bread even here, sent to the Confederacy, 
where it is neither to be earned nor bought, without 
money, friends, or a home. Hundreds have comfort 
able homes here, which will be confiscated to enrich 
those who drive them out. "It is an ill wind that 
blows no one good." Such dismal faces as one meets 
everywhere! Each looks heartbroken. Homeless, 
friendless, beggars, is written in every eye. Brother's 
face is too unhappy to make it pleasant to look at 
him. True, he is safe; but hundreds of his friends are 
going forth destitute, leaving happy homes behind, 
not knowing where the crust of bread for famishing 
children is to come from to-morrow. He went to 
General Bowens and asked if it were possible that 
women and children were included in the order. Yes, 
he said; they should all go, and go in the Confederacy. They should not be allowed to go elsewhere. 
Penned up like sheep to starve! That's the idea! 
With the addition of forty thousand mouths to feed, 
they think they can invoke famine to their aid, seeing that their negro brothers don't help them much 
in the task of subjugating us.

Don't care who knows I smuggled in a dozen letters! Wish I had had more!
