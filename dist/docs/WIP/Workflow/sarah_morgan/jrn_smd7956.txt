Shall I cry, faint, scream, or go off in hysterics? Tell me which, quickly; for to doubt this news is fine 
and imprisonment, and if I really believe it I would certainly give way to my feelings and commit some 
vagaries of the kind. My resolution is formed!  I will do neither; I won't gratify the Yankees so much. I 
have been banging at the piano until my fingers are weary, and singing "The Secret through Life to be 
Happy " until my voice is cracked ; I'll stand on my head if necessary, to prove my indifference ; but I'll 
never believe this is true until it is confirmed by stronger authority.

Day before yesterday came tidings that <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a> had fallen on the 4th inst. The "Era" poured 
out extras, and sundry little popguns fizzled out salutes. All who doubted the truth of the report and 
were brave enough to say so were fined or imprisoned; it has become a penal offense to doubt what 
the "Era" says; so quite a number of arrests were made. This morning it was followed up by the announcement of the capture of Port Hudson. The 
guns are pealing for true, and the Yankees at head quarters may be seen skipping like lambs, for very 
joy. And I still disbelieve!  Skeptic! The first thing I know that " Era" man will be coming here to convert me! But I don t, can t, won't believe it! <em>If</em> it is true, but I find consolation in this faith: it is 
either true, or not true, if it is true, it is all for the best, and if it is not true, it is better still. Whichever 
it is, is for some wise purpose ; so it does not matter, so we wait, pray, and believe.

I don't believe it? What am I crying about then? It seems so hard! How the mighty are fallen!  Port 
Hudson gone! Brother believes it. That is enough for me. God bless him!  I cry hourly. He is so good 
and considerate. He told me, "Name your friends, and what can be done for them shall be attended to. The prisoners will be sent here. Maybe I cannot do 
much ; but food and clothing you shall have in abundance for them when they arrive." God bless him for 
his kindness! 
</p><p>
O dear, noble men!  I am afraid to meet them ; I should do something foolish ; best take my cry out in 
private now. May the Lord look down in pity on us!  Port Hudson does not matter so much; but these 
brave, noble creatures! The "Era" says they had devoured their last mule before they surrendered.
