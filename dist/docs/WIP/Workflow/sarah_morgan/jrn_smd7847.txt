Last night the town was in a dreadful state of 
excitement. Before sunset a regiment, that had been 
camped out of town, came in, and pitched their tents 
around the new theatre, in front of our church. All 
was commotion and bustle; and as the pickets had 
been drawn in, and the soldiers talked freely of expecting an attack, everybody believed it, and was 
consequently in rather an unpleasant state of anticipation. Their cannon were on the commons back of 
the church, the artillery horses tied to the wheels; 
while some dozen tents were placed around, filled 
with men who were ready to harness them at the 
first alarm. With all these preparations in full view, 
we went to bed as usual. I did not even take the 
trouble of gathering my things which I had removed from my "peddler sack"; and slept, satisfied that, if forced to fly, I would lose almost every 
thing in spite of my precaution in making a bag. 
</p><p>
Well! night passed, and here is morning, and nothing is heard yet. The attack is delayed until this 
evening, or to-morrow, they say. Woman though 
I am, I am by no means as frightened as some of 
these men are. I can't get excited about it. Perhaps 
it is because they know the danger, and I do not. 
But I hate to see men uneasy! I have been so accustomed to brave, fearless ones, who would beard the 
Devil himself, that it gives me a great disgust to see 
any one less daring than father and the boys. 
</p><p>
I have been so busy preparing to go to the city 
that I think if the frolic should intervene and pre 
vent my departure, I would be disappointed, though 
I do not want to go. It would be unpleasant, for 
instance, to pack all I own in my trunk, and just as 
I place the key in my pocket to hear the shriek of 
"Van Dorn!" raised again. This time it is to be 
Ruggles, though. I would not mind if he came before 
I was packed. Besides, even if I miss the fun here, 
they say the boats are fired into from Plaquemine; 
and then I have the pleasure of being in a fight 
anyhow. Mother is alarmed about that part of my 
voyage, but Miriam and I persuaded her it is nothing. 
</p><p>
If I was a man oh, wouldn't I be in <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> with the boys! . . . What is the use of all these 
worthless women, in war times? If they attack, I 
shall don the breeches, and join the assailants, and 
fight, though I think they would be hopeless fools 
to attempt to capture a town they could not hold for 
ten minutes under the gunboats. How do breeches 
and coats feel, I wonder ?^I am actually afraid of 
them. I kept a suit of Jimmy's hanging in the armoir for six weeks waiting for the Yankees to 
come, thinking fright would give me courage to try it 
(what a seeming paradox!), but I never succeeded. 
Lilly one day insisted on my trying it, and I advanced 
so far as to lay it on the bed, and then carried my 
bird out I was ashamed to let even my canary 
see me ; but when I took a second look, my courage deserted me, and there ended my first and last 
attempt at disguise. I have heard so many girls boast of having worn men's clothes; I wonder where they get the courage.

To think half the men in town sat up all night in expectation of a stampede, while we poor women 
slept serenely! Everybody is digging pits to hide in when the ball opens. The Days have dug a tremendous one; the Wolffs, Sheppers, and some fifty others 
have taken the same precaution. They may as well dig their graves at once ; what if a tremendous shell 
should burst over them, and bury in the dirt those who were not killed ? Oh, no ! let me see all the danger, 
and the way it is coming, at once. To-morrow, or 
day after, in case no unexpected little incident occurs in the interval, I purpose going to New Or 
leans, taking father's papers and part of Miriam's and mother's valuables for safe-keeping. I hate to 
go, but they all think I should, as it will be one less to look after if we are shelled which I doubt. I 
Don't know that I require much protection, but I might as well be agreeable and go. Ouf ! how I will grow homesick, before I am out of sight!

Midnight. 
</p><p>
Here we go, sure enough. At precisely eleven 
o clock, while we were enjoying our first dreams, we 
were startled by the long roll which was beat half a 
square below us. At first I only repeated "The roll 
of the drum," without an idea connected with it; but 
hearing the soldiers running, in another instant I 
was up, and was putting on my stockings when 
Miriam ran in, in her nightgown. The children were 
roused and dressed quickly, and it did not take us 
many instants to prepare, the report of two shots, 
and the tramp of soldiers, cries of "Double-quick," 
and sound as of cannon moving, rather hastening 
our movements. Armoirs, bureaus, and everything 
else were thrown open, and Miriam and I hastily 
packed our sacks with any articles that came to 
hand, having previously taken the precaution to put 
on everything fresh from the armoir. We have saved 
what we can ; but I find myself obliged to leave one 
of my new muslins I had just finished, as it occupied 
more room than I can afford, the body of my lovely 
lilac, and my beauteous white mull. But then, I have 
saved eight half-made linen chemises! that will be 
better than the outward show.

Here comes an alarm of fire at least a dreadful 
odor of burning cotton which has set everybody 
wild with fear that conflagration is to be added to 
these horrors. The cavalry swept past on their way 
to the river ten minutes ago, and here comes the 
news that the gunboats are drawing up their anchors and making ready. Well! here an hour has 
passed; suppose they do not come after all? I have 
been watching two sentinels at the corner, who are 
singing and dancing in the gayest way. One reminds 
me of Gibbes ; I have seen him dance that way often. 
I was glad to see a good-humored man again. I wish 
I was in bed. I am only sitting up to satisfy my conscience, for I have long since ceased to expect a real 
bombardment. If it must come, let it be now; I 
am tired of waiting. A crowd of women have sought 
the protection of the gunboats. I am distressed 
about the Bruno ts; suppose they did not hear the 
noise? O girls ! if I was a man, I wonder what would 
induce me to leave you four lone, unprotected women 
sleeping in that house, unconscious of all this? Is 
manhood a dream that is past? Is humanity an idle 
name? Fatherless, brotherless girls, if I was honored 
with the title of Man, I do believe I would be fool 
enough to run around and wake you, at least! Not 
another word, though. I shall go mad with rage and 
disgust. I am going to bed. This must be a humbug. 
Morgan came running in, once more in his nightgear, begging Lilly to hear his prayers. In answer to 
her "Why? You have said them to-night!" he says, 
"Yes! but I ve been getting up so often!" Poor 
child ! no wonder he is perplexed ! 
</p><p>
One hour and a half of this nonsense, and no result known. We are told the firing commenced, and the 
pickets were driven in, twenty minutes before the long roll beat.
