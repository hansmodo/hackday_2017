</p><p>
Friday morning we arose and prepared to resume our journey for <a href='/results.php?city=madisonville' rel='city'>Bonfouca</a>, twenty-three miles away. 
The man walked in very unceremoniously to get corn from the armoir as we got up, throwing open the 
windows and performing sundry little offices usually reserved forfemmes-de-chambre; but with that exception everything went on very well. Breakfast being a 
luxury not to be procured, we got into the carriages 
before sunrise, and left this romantic abode of dogs 
and contentment. Again our road lay through piney 
woods, so much like that from Hammond to Ponchatoula that involuntarily I found myself looking 
through the window to see if Mr. Halsey was there. 
It lacked only his presence to make the scene all in 
all the same. But alas! this time the driver picked me 
wild flowers, and brought us haws. Mr. Halsey, in 
blissful ignorance of our departure, was many and 
many a mile away. The drive was not half as amusing. The horse would not suffer any one except 
Miriam to drive, and at last refused to move until 
the driver got down and ran along by the carriage. 
Every time the poor boy attempted to occupy his 
seat, the obstinate animal would come to a dead stop 
and refuse to go until he dismounted again. I am 
sure that he walked nineteen miles out of the twenty-three, out of complaisance to the ungrateful brute. 
All equally fatigued and warm, we reached this 
place about twelve o clock. Mrs. Bull had arrived 
before us; and as the carriage stopped, her girl Delia 
came to the gate the personification of despair, cry 
ing, " You can't get out, ladies. They say we can't 
stop here; we must go right back." The panic which 
ensued is indescribable. Go back when we were al 
most at our journey's end, after all the money we 
had spent, the fatigue we had undergone, to be 
turned back all the way to <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, perhaps! " With 
my sick babies!" cried Mrs. Ivy. "With my sick 
child!" cried mother. "Never! You may turn me 
out of your house, but we will die in the woods first! 
To go back is to kill my daughter and these babies ! " 
This was to the overseer who came to the carriage. 
"Madam, I have orders to allow no one to pass who 
has not written permission. Lieutenant Worthington sent the order two days ago ; and I am liable to 
imprisonment if I harbor those who have no pass 
port," the man explained. "But we have General Gardiner's order," I expostulated. "Then you shall 
certainly pass; but these ladies cannot. I can't turn you away, though; you shall all come in and stay until something can be determined on." 
</p><p>
This much granted was an unlooked-for blessing. 
He showed us the way to a large unfurnished house, 
one room of which contained a bed with one naked 
mattress, which was to be our apartment. Mrs. Bull 
sat down in a calm, dignified state of despair; little 
Mrs. Ivy dissolved in tears; we all felt equally disconsolate; the prospect of getting off was not so 
pleasant when we thought we should be obliged to 
leave them behind. Our common misfortunes had 
endeared us to each other, strangers as we were a 
week ago. So we all lamented together, a perfect Jeremiade of despair. The overseer is very tender 
hearted; he condoled, comforted, and finally deter 
mined that if there was any way of getting them off, 
they should go. A glimpse of sunshine returned to 
our lowering sky, and cheerfulness reigned once 
more, to be violently dethroned some hours later. 
Three of the <a href='/results.php?city=madisonville' rel='city'>Madisonville</a> pickets were announced 
approaching the house. Of course, they were coming 
after us ! Oh, that vile Mr. Worthington ! We always 
did hate him! There was such a sneaky look about 
him. Hypocrite ! we always felt we should hate him ! 
Oh, the wretch! "I won't go back!" cried mother. 
"I shall not," said quiet Mrs. Bull. "He shall pay 
my expenses if he insists on taking me back!" exclaimed Mrs. Ivy. "Spent all my money! Mrs. Bull, 
you have none to lend me, remember, and Mrs. Morgan shan't ! Oh, that Worthington ! Let's make 
him pay for all!" We smothered our laughter to sit 
trembling within as the pickets stepped on the gallery. I believe we commenced praying. Just think! 
Thus far, our journey has cost mother two hundred 
and twenty dollars. It would cost the same to get 
back to blessed <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, and fancy our spending that 
sum to settle there again ! Besides, we gave away all 
our clothes to our suffering friends ; and what would 
we do there now? 
</p><p>
After half an hour of painful suspense, we discovered that it would have been as well to spare poor 
Mr. Worthington ; for the pickets were not after us, but had come to escort Mrs. R , a woman who 
was taking the body of her son, who was killed at <a href='/results.php?city=murfreesboro' rel='city origin'>Murfreesboro</a>, to the city for interment. Poor 
woman ! she rode all this distance sitting on her child's 
coffin. Her husband was one of those who with 
B - stole that large sum of money from father 
which came so near ruining him. She speaks of her 
husband as of a departed saint. I dare say she believes him innocent of the theft in spite of his public 
confession. The grave has wiped out even the disgrace of the penitentiary where he expiated his 
offense. . . . When I told Tiche who the woman was, 
she clasped her hands, saying, "The Lord is good! 
Years and years master suffered while she grew rich, 
and now her time comes! The Lord don't forget! " I 
can't feel that way. It is well for the narrow-minded 
to look for God's judgment on us for our sins; but 
mine is a more liberal faith. God afflicted her for 
some wise purpose; but if I thought it was to avenge 
father, I should be afraid of her. As it is, I can be 
sorry, oh, so sorry for her! 
</p><p>
As usual I find myself taken care of at the expense 
of the others. There are but two bars on the place ; 
one, the overseer said, should be for me, the other for 
the children. Sheets were scarce, covers scarcer 
still. Tired of being spoiled in this way, I insisted on 
being allowed to sleep on a mattress on the floor, 
after a vigorous skirmish with mother and Miriam, 
in which I came off victorious. For a bar, I impressed 
Miriam's grenadine dress, which she fastened to the 
doorknob and let fall over me a la Victoria tester 
arrangement. To my share fell a double blanket, 
which, as Tiche had no cover, I unfolded, and as she 
used the foot of my bed for a pillow, gave her the 
other end of it, thus (tell it not in Yankeeland, for 
it will never be credited) actually sleeping under the 
same bedclothes with our black, shiny negro nurse! 
We are grateful, though, even for these discomforts; 
it might have been so much worse! Indeed, I fear 
that our fellow travelers do not fare as well. Those 
who have sheets have no bars ; those who have blankets have no sheets ; and one woman who has recently 
joined us has nothing except a mattress which is to 
do the duty of all three. But then, we got bread! 
Real, pure, wheat bread! And coffee! None of your 
potato, burnt sugar, and parched corn abomination, 
but the unadulterated berry! I can't enjoy it fully, 
though; every mouthful is cloyed with the recollection that Lilly and her children have none. 
</p><p>
As usual, as Mrs. Greyson says, the flowers follow us; yesterday I received three bouquets, and Miriam 
got one too. In this out-of-the-way place such offerings are unexpected ; and these were doubly gratifying coming from people one is not accustomed to 
receiving them from. For instance, the first was from the overseer, the second from a servant, and 
the third from a poor boy for whom we have subscribed to pay his passage to the city.
