A letter from Captain Bradford to Miriam. My 
poor Adonis, that I used to ridicule so unmercifully, 
what misfortunes have befallen him ! He writes that 
during the siege at Port Hudson he had the top of 
his ear shot off (wonder if he lost any of that beautiful golden fleece yclept his hair?), and had the cap 
of his knee removed by a shell, besides a third wound 
he does not specify. Fortunately he is with kind 
friends. And he gives news of Lydia, most accept 
able since such a time has elapsed since we heard 
from her. ... He says, "Tell Miss Sarah that the 
last I saw of John, he was crossing the Mississippi in 
a skiff, his parole in his pocket, his sweet little sister 
by his side," (O you wretch! at it again!) "and 
Somebody else in his heart." How considerate to 
volunteer the last statement ! Then followed half a 
page of commendation for his bravery, daring, and 
skill during the siege (the only kind word he ever 
spoke of him, I dare say), all looking as though I 
was to take it as an especial compliment to myself, 
and was expected to look foolish, blush, and say 
"Thanky" for it. As though I care! 
</p><p>
Monday night. 
</p><p>
I consider myself outrageously imposed upon! I 
am so indignant that I have spent a whole evening 
making faces at myself. "Please, Miss Sarah, look 
natural ! " William petitions. " I never saw you look 
cross before." Good reason! I never had more 
cause! However, I stop in the midst of a hideous 
grimace, and join in a game of hide the switch with 
the children to forget my annoyance. 
</p><p>
Of course a woman is at the bottom of it. Last 
night while Ada and Marie were here, a young lady 
whose name I decline to reveal for the sake of the 
sex, stopped at the door with an English officer, and 
asked to see me in the entry. I had met her once 
before. Remember this, for that is the chief cause 
of my anger. Of course they were invited in ; but she 
declined, saying she had but a moment, and had a 
message to deliver to me alone, so led me apart. 
"Of course you know who it is from? " she began. I 
told a deliberate falsehood, and said no, though I 
guessed instantly. She told me the name then. She 
had visited the prison the day before, and there had 
met the individual whose name, joined to mine, has 
given me more trouble and annoyance during the 
last few months than it would be possible to mention. "And our entire conversation was about you," 
she said, as though to flatter my vanity immensely. 
He told her then that he had written repeatedly 
to me, without receiving an answer, and at last had 
written again, in which he had used some expressions 
which he feared had offended my reserved disposition. Something had made me angry, for without 
returning letter or message to say I was not displeased, I had maintained a resolute silence, which 
had given him more pain and uneasiness than he could say. That during all this time he had had no 
opportunity of explaining it to me, and that now he begged her to tell me that he would not offend me 
for worlds that he admired me more than any one he had ever met, that he could not help saying what 
he did, but was distressed at offending me, etc. The longest explanation! And she was directed to beg 
me to explain my silence, and let him know if I was really offended, and also leave no entreaty or argument untried to induce me to visit the prison; he must see me. 
</p><p>
As to visiting the prison, I told her that was impossible. (O how glad I am that I never did !) But 
as to the letters, told her " to assure him that I had 
not thought of them in that light, and had passed 
over the expressions he referred to as idle words it 
would be ridiculous to take offense at; and that my 
only reason for persevering in this silence had been 
that Brother disapproved of my writing to gentle 
men, and I had promised that I would not write to 
him. That I had feared he would misconstrue my 
silence, and had wished to explain it to him, but I 
had no means of doing so except by breaking my 
promise; and so had preferred leaving all explanation to time, and some future opportunity." 
</p><p>
"But you did not mean to pain him, did you?" the dear little creature coaxingly lisped, standing 
on tiptoe to kiss me as she spoke. I assured her that 
I had not. "He has been dangerously ill," she continued, apologizingly, "and sickness has made him 
more morbid and more unhappy about it than he 
would otherwise have been. It has distressed him a great deal." 
</p><p>
I felt awkwardly. How was it that this girl, meeting him for the first and only time in her life, had 
contrived to learn so much that she had no right to know, and appeared here as mediator between two 
who were strangers to her, so far usurping a place 
she was not entitled to, as to apologize to me for his 
sensitiveness, and to entreat me to tell him he had 
not forfeited my esteem, as though she was his most 
intimate friend, and I a passing acquaintance? Failing to comprehend it, I deferred it to a leisure moment to think over, and in the mean time exerted 
myself to be affable. 
</p><p>
I can't say half she spoke of, but as she was going 
she said, "Then will you give me permission to say 
as many sweet things for you as I can think of? I'm 
going there to-morrow." I told her I would be afraid 
to give her carte blanche on such a subject; but that 
she would really oblige me by explaining about the 
letters. She promised, and after another kiss, and a 
few whispered words, left me. 
</p><p>
Maybe she exaggerated, though! Uncharitable 
as the supposition was, it was a consolation. I was 
unwilling to believe that any one who professed to 
esteem me would make me the subject of conversation with a stranger and such a conversation! 
So my comfort was only in hoping that she had related a combination of truth and fiction, and that 
he had not been guilty of such folly. 
</p><p>
Presently it grew clearer to me. I must be growing in wickedness, to fathom that of others, I who so 
short a time ago disbelieved in the very existence of 
such a thing. I remembered having heard that the 
young lady and her family were extremely anxious 
to form his acquaintance, and that her cousin had 
coolly informed Ada that she had selected him 
among all others, and meant to have him for a beau 
as soon as she could be introduced to him ; I remembered that the young lady herself had been very 
anxious to discover whether the reputation common 
report had given me had any foundation. 
</p><p>
As soon as we were alone, I told mother of our 
conversation in the entry, and said, "And now I am 
certain that this girl has made use of my name to 
become acquainted with him."
