Again last night, about nine, we heard cannon in <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, and watched the flashes,, which preceded 
the reports by a minute, at least, for a long time. We must have seen our own firing ; perhaps we wanted 
to find out the batteries of the enemy. It was not the most delightful thing imaginable to watch what 
might be the downfall of our only home ! And then to think each ball might bring death to some one we love! Ah, no! it was not pleasant!

Miriam and I have many friends in Breckinridge's division, I expect, if we could only hear the names 
of the regiments. The Fourth is certainly there. And poor Will! I wonder if he has had his supper 
yet? I have been thinking of him ever since Mr. Scales told me he was there, and praying myself sick 
for his safety and that of the rest. I shut my eyes at every report and say, "Oh, please! poor Will! 
and the others, too!" And when I don't hear the cannon, I pray, to be in advance of the next.

It is now midday, and again we hear firing; but have yet to learn the true story of the first day's 
fight. Preserve me from the country in such stirring days! We might as well be in Europe as to have 
the Mississippi between us and town. By unanimous consent, the little lane in front of 
the house has been christened "Guerrilla Lane," and the long one leading to the river, "Arkansas." What 
an episode that was, in our lives ! The officers go by the name of Miriam's, Ginnie's, Sarah's, as though they belonged to each!

Those girls did me the meanest thing imaginable. Mr. Talbot and I were planning a grand combined 
attack on <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, in which he was to command a fleet and attack the town by the river, while I 
promised to get up a battalion of girls and attack them in the rear. We had settled it all, except the 
time, when just then all the others stopped talking. I went on: "And now, it is only necessary for you 
to name the day - Here the girls commenced to giggle, and the young men tried to suppress a smile; 
I felt annoyed, but it did not strike me until after they had left, that I had said anything absurd. What 
evil imaginations they must have, if they could have fancied I meant anything except the battle!
