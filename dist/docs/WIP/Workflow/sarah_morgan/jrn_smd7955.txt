O praise the Lord, O my soul! Here is good news enough to make me happy for a month!  Brother is so good about that!  Every time he hears good news 
on our side, he tells it just as though it was on his side, instead of on ours ; while all bad news for us he 
carefully avoids mentioning, unless we question him. So to-day he brought in a budget for us.

<a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel=''>Lee</a> has crossed the Potomac on his way to <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city origin'>Washington</a> with one hundred and sixty thousand men. Gibbes and George are with him. Magruder is marching on Fort Jackson, to attack it in the rear. One or two of our English ironclads are reported at the mouth of the river, and Farragut has gone down 
to capture them. O Jimmy! Jimmy! suppose he 
should be on one of them? We don't know the name of his ship, and it makes us so anxious for him, during these months that we have heard nothing of his 
whereabouts. 
It is so delightful to see these frightened Yankees! One has only to walk downtown to be satisfied of the 
alarm that reigns. Yesterday came the tidings of the capture of Brashere City by our troops, and that a 
brigade was fifteen miles above here, coming down to the city. Men congregated at corners whispering 
cautiously. These were evidently Confederates who had taken the oath. Solitary Yankees straggled 
along with the most lugubrious faces, troubling no one. We walked down to Blineau's with Mrs. Price, 
and over our ice-cream she introduced her husband, who is a true blue Union man, though she, like our 
selves, is a rank Rebel. Mr. Price, on the eve of making an immense fortune, was perfectly disconsolate 
at the news. Every one was to be ruined ; starvation would follow if the Confederates entered ; there was 
never a more dismal, unhappy creature. Enchanted at the news, I naturally asked if it were reliable. 
"Perfectly!  Why, to prove how true, standing at the door of this salon five minutes ago, I saw two young 
ladies pass with Confederate flags, which they flirted in the face of some Federal officers, unrebuked!" Verily, thought I, something is about to 
happen! Two days ago the girls who were "unrebuked" this evening would have found themselves in jail instead.
