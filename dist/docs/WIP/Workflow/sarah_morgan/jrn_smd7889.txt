My mark finds me at <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a>, though I had not the slightest idea that it would. Wonder where 
twenty pages beyond will find me? At home, I hope and pray, though I am as happy here as I could possibly be in any place on earth.

Stirring news from our armies comes pouring in. Sunday, Colonel Breaux told me of <a href='/results.php?tla=jew' rel=''>Wool's</a> defeat, 
and the great number of prisoners, cannon, and the large supplies of stores and ammunition that we had captured. Then Tuesday we heard of three great 
battles in Maryland, the third one still continuing; but no particulars of any of them. Yesterday came 
tidings of our having recrossed the Potomac, and to-day we hear that <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan's</a> army has been cut 
to pieces; but whether it is the same old fight or a new one, I cannot as yet learn ; for reliable information is not easily obtained in America at this period.

Did I ever record how little truth there was in any of that last <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> news? It speaks for itself, 
though. Not a boat lay at <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>; Camp Moore was not even threatened; Ponchatoula Station was burned, but the one battery was retaken by our men the same night.

But still these false reports cannot equal the Yankees . Take, for instance, the report of the Captain of the Essex. I give General Carter as my 
authority. The Captain reports having been fired on by a battery of thirty-six large guns, at Port Hudson, some weeks ago, when he opened fire and 
silenced them, one after the other, from the first to the last. Not a shot from the "rebel" batteries 
reached them, and not a casualty on their side occurred. But the loss of the Confederates must 
have been awful. He came within I forget how many yards from the shore, and there was not a 
live man to be seen. He did not mention if there were any dead ones ! Now for the other side. There 
were but four guns mounted there at the time. Shot and shell from those four certainly reached some 
thing, for one was seen to enter a porthole, from whence issued frightful shrieks soon after, and it is 
well known that the Essex is so badly injured by "something" as to be in a sinking condition, and 
only kept afloat by a gunboat lashed on either side. If she is uninjured, why did she not return and burn 
Natchez as she announced? In leaving Port Hudson, where "not a live man was to be seen" (nor a dead 
one to be found), she stopped at Mr. Babin's, just below Dr. Nolan's, where she remained the rest of 
the day. After she left, being curious to discover the reason of her short stay, Mr. Babin walked to the 
place where she had been, and discovered sixteen fresh graves on the bank. If they buried them as 
they did at <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>, four in a 
grave, how many would they be? But granting there were but sixteen, would that prove the veracity of the Captain? Poor man! Perhaps he is 
related to Pope, and cannot help himself.
