"All things are taken from us, and become portions and parcels of the dreadful pasts." . . . 
</p><p>
Thursday the 13th came the dreadful tidings of the surrender of <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel=''>Lee</a> and his army on the 9th. Everybody cried, but I would not, satisfied that God will 
still save us, even though all should apparently be lost. Followed at intervals of two or three hours 
by the announcement of the capture of <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, Selma, Mobile, and Johnston's army, even the stanches't Southerners were hopeless. Every one proclaimed 
Peace, and the only matter under consideration was whether <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel=''>Jeff Davis</a>, all politicians, every man above 
the rank of Captain in the army and above that of Lieutenant in the navy, should be hanged immediately, or some graciously pardoned. Henry Ward Beecher humanely pleaded mercy for us, supported by a small minority. <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel=''>Davis</a> and all leading men must 
be executed ; the blood of the others would serve to 
irrigate the country. Under this lively prospect, 
Peace, blessed Peace! was the cry. I whispered, 
"Never!  Let a great earthquake swallow us up first!  
Let us leave our land and emigrate to any desert 
spot of the earth, rather than return to the Union, 
even as it Was!" 
</p><p>
Six days this has lasted. Blessed with the 
silently obstinate disposition, I would not dispute, 
but felt my heart swell, repeating, " God is our refuge 
and our strength, a very present help in time of 
trouble," and could not for an instant believe this 
could end in an overthrow. 
</p><p>
This morning, when I went down to breakfast at seven, Brother read the announcement of the assassination of <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> and Secretary Seward. 
</p><p>
"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." This is murder! God have mercy on those who did it! 
</p><p>
Charlotte Corday killed Marat in his bath, and is held up in history as one of Liberty's martyrs, and 
one of the heroines of her country. To me, it is all murder. Let historians extol blood-shedding; it is 
woman's place to abhor it. And because I know that they would have apotheosized any man who had 
crucified <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel=''>Jeff Davis</a>, I abhor this, and call it foul murder, unworthy of our cause and God grant it was 
only the temporary insanity of a desperate man that committed this crime! Let not his blood be visited on our nation, Lord! 
</p><p>
Across the way, a large building, undoubtedly 
inhabited by officers, is being draped in black. Immense streamers of black and white hang from the 
balcony. Downtown, I understand, all shops are closed, and all wrapped in mourning. And I hardly 
dare pray God to bless us, with the crape hanging over the way. It would have been banners, if our 
President had been killed, though!
