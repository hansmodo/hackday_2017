We three girls fancied a walk last evening, and immediately after dinner prepared to walk to Mrs. Breaux's, only a mile, and get her to come to the 
sugar-house. But as we put on our bonnets, Captain Bradford, brother of the one who left in the morning, 
was announced, and our expedition had to be abandoned. This is the third of the five brothers that 
I have met, and if it were not for the peculiarity in their voices, I should say that there was not the 
most distant relationship existing between them. This one is very handsome, quiet, and what Dickens 
calls "in a high-shouldered state of deportment." He looks like a moss-covered stone wall, a slumbering volcano, a what you please, so it suggests 
anything unexpected and dangerous to stumble over. A man of indomitable will and intense feeling, I am sure. I should not like to rouse his temper, 
or give him cause to hate me. A trip to the sugar-house followed, as a matter of course, and we showed him around, and told him of the fun we had those 
two nights, and taught him how to use a paddle like a Christian. We remained there until supper-time, 
when we adjourned to the house, where we spent the remainder of the evening very pleasantly. At least I suppose he found it so, for it was ten o'clock before he left.

Just now I was startled by a pistol shot. Threatening to shoot her, Mr. Carter playfully aimed 
Miriam's pistol at her, and before he could take fair aim, one barrel went off, the shot grazing her arm 
and passing through the armoir just behind. Of course, there was great consternation. Those two 
seem doomed to kill each other. She had played him the same trick before. He swore that he would 
have killed himself with the other shot if she had been hurt; but what good would that do her?
