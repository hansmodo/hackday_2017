I hear to-day that the Brunots have returned to <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, determined to await the grand finale 
there. They, and two other families, alone remain. With these exceptions, and a few Dutch and Irish 
who cannot leave, the town is perfectly deserted by all except the Confederate soldiers. I wish I was 
with them ! If all chance of finding lodgings here is lost, and mother remains with Lilly, as she some 
times seems more than half inclined, and Miriam goes to <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a>, as she frequently threatens, I 
believe I will take a notion, too, and go to Mrs. Brunot! I would rather be there, in all the uncertainty, expecting to be shelled or burnt out every 
hour, than here. Ouf! what a country! Next time I go shopping, I mean to ask some clerk, out of 
curiosity, what they do sell in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>. The following is a list of a few of the articles that shopkeepers 
actually laugh at you if you ask for: Glasses, flour, soap, starch, coffee, candles, matches, shoes, combs, 
guitar-strings, bird-seed, in short, everything that I have heretofore considered as necessary to existence. If any one had told me I could have lived 
off of cornbread, a few months ago, I would have been incredulous ; now I believe it, and return an inward grace for the blessing at every mouthful. I have 
not tasted a piece of wheatbread since I left home, and shall hardly taste it again until the war is over.

I do not like this small burg. It is very straggling and pretty, but I would rather not inhabit it. We 
are as well known here as though we carried our cards on our faces, and it is peculiarly disagreeable 
to me to overhear myself spoken about, by people I Don't know, as "There goes Miss Morgan," as that 
young man, for instance, remarked this morning to a crowd, just as I passed. It is not polite, to say the least.

Will Carter was here this morning and told me he saw Theodore Pinckney in the streets. I suppose he 
is on his way home, and think he will be a little disappointed in not finding us at <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> as he 
expects, and still more so to hear he passed through the very town where we were staying, without knowing it.
