My dear Brother, who is always seeking to make 
somebody happy, arranged a dinner-party at the 
lake for us Saturday. There was quite a number of 
us, as, besides ourselves and the five children, we 
had Mrs. Price and her children, Mrs. Bull, and three 
nurses. . . . There are no Southern young men left in 
town, and those who remain would hardly be received 
with civility by Miriam and myself. Of the Yankees, 
Brother has so much consideration for us that he 
has never invited one to his house since we have been 
here, though he has many friends among them who 
visited here before our arrival. Such delicacy of feeling we fully appreciate, knowing how very few men 
of such a hospitable nature would be capable of such 
a sacrifice. Thinking we need company, Brother frequently invites what he calls "a safe old Secessionist" (an old bachelor of fifty- three who was wounded 
at Shiloh) to dine with us ; thinking it a fair compromise between the stay-at-home youth and Yankees, 
neither of whom this extremely young man could be 
confounded with.
