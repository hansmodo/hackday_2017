As a specimen of the humanity of General Butler, let me record a threat of his uttered with all the force 
and meaning language can convey, and certainly enough to strike terror in the hearts of frail women, 
since all these men believe him fully equal to carry it into execution ; some even believe it will be done. 
In speaking to Mr. Solomon Benjamin of foreign intervention in our favor, he said, "Let England or 
France try it, and I'll be - - if I don't arm every negro in the South, and make them cut the throat of 
every man, woman, and child in it! I'll make them lay the whole country waste with fire and sword, 
and leave it desolate!" Draw me a finer picture of Coward, Brute, or Bully than that one sentence 
portrays! O men of the North! you do your noble hearts wrong in sending such ruffians among us as 
the representatives of a great people! Was ever a more brutal thought uttered in a more brutal way? 
Mother, like many another, is crazy to go away from here, even to <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>; but like the rest, will be 
obliged to stand and await her fate. I don't believe Butler would dare execute his threat, for at the first 
attempt, thousands, who are passive now, would cut the brutal heart from his inhuman breast.
