These people mean to kill us with kindness. 
There is such a thing as being too kind. Yesterday 
General Williams sent a barrel of flour to mother, 
accompanied by a note begging her to accept it 
"in consideration of the present condition of the circulating currency," and the intention was so kind, 
the way it was done so delicate, that there was no 
refusing it. I had to write her thanks, and got in a 
violent fit of the "trembles" at the idea of writing 
to a stranger. One consolation is, that I am not a 
very big fool, for it took only three lines to prove 
myself one. If I had been a thundering big one, I 
would have occupied two pages to show myself fully. 
And to think it is out of our power to prove them 
our appreciation of the kindness we have universally 
met with ! Many officers were in church this morning, 
and as they passed us while we waited for the door 
to be opened, General Williams bowed profoundly, 
another followed his example; we returned the sa 
lute, of course. But by to-morrow, those he did not 
bow to will cry treason against us. Let them howl. 
I am tired of lies, scandal, and deceit. All the loudest 
gossips have been frightened into the country, but 
enough remain to keep them well supplied with town 
talk. ... It is such a consolation to turn to the dear 
good people of the world after coming in contact 
with such cattle. Here, for instance, is Mr. Bonnecase on whom we have not the slightest claims. 
Every day since we have been here, he has sent a 
great pitcher of milk, knowing our cow is out; one 
day he sent rice, the next sardines, yesterday two 
bottles of Port and Madeira, which cannot be purchased in the whole South. What a duck of an old man! That is only one instance.
