Well! Day before yesterday, I almost vowed I 
would not return, and last evening I reached here. 
Verily, consistency, thou art a jewel ! I determined 
to get to town to lay both sides of the question be 
fore mother; saving home and property, by remain 
ing, thereby cutting ourselves off forever from the 
boys and dying of yellow fever; or flying to Mississippi, losing all save our lives. So as Mrs. Brunot was 
panic-stricken and determined to die in town rather than be starved at Green well, and was going in 
on the same wagon that came out the night before, 
I got up with her and Nettie, and left <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a> at 
ten yesterday morning, bringing nothing except this 
old book, which I would rather not lose, as it has 
been an old and kind friend during these days of 
trouble. At first, I avoided all mention of political 
affairs, but now there is nothing else to be thought 
of; if it is not burnt for treason, I will like to look it 
over some day if I live. I left <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a>, without 
ever looking around it, beyond one walk to the 
hotel, so I may say I hardly know what it looks 
like. Miriam stayed, much against her will, I fear, 
to bring in our trunks, if I could send a wagon. 
A guerrilla picket stopped us before we had gone 
a mile, and seemed disposed to turn us back. We 
said we must pass ; our all was at stake. They then 
entreated us not to enter, saying it was not safe. I 
asked if they meant to burn it; " We will help try it," 
was the answer. I begged them to delay the experiment until we could get away. One waved his hat 
to me and said he would fight for me. Hope he 
will at a distance. They asked if we had no protectors; "None," we said. "Don't go, then"; and 
they all looked so sorry for us. We said we must; 
starvation, and another panic awaited us out there, 
our brothers were fighting, our fathers dead ; we had 
only our own judgment to rely on, and that told us 
home was the best place for us; if the town must 
burn, let us burn in our houses, rather than be murdered in the woods. They looked still more sorry, 
but still begged us not to remain. We would, though, 
and one young boy called out as we drove off, 
"What's the name of that young lady who refused 
the escort?" I told him, and they too expressed the 
greatest regret that she had not accepted. We met 
many on the road, nearly all of whom talked to us, 
and as they were most respectful in their manner 
(though they saw us in a mule team !) , we gave them 
all the information we could, which was all news to 
them, though very little. Such a ride in the hot sun, 
perched up in the air ! One of the servants remarked, 
"Miss Sarah ain't ashamed to ride in a wagon ! " With 
truth I replied, "No, I was never so high before." 
Two miles from home we met the first Federal 
pickets, and then they grew more numerous, until 
we came on a large camp near our graveyard, filled 
with soldiers and cannon. From first to last none 
refrained from laughing at us; not aloud, but they 
would grin and be inwardly convulsed with laughter 
as we passed. One laughed so comically that I 
dropped my veil hastily for fear he would see me 
smile. I could not help it; if any one smiled at me 
while I was dying, I believe I would return it. We 
passed crowds, for it was now five o clock, and all 
seemed to be promenading. There were several officers standing at the corner, near our house, who 
were very much amused at our vehicle. I did not 
feel like smiling then. After reducing us to riding in 
a mule team, they were heartless enough to laugh! 
I forgot them presently, and gave my whole attention to getting out respectably. Now getting in a 
wagon is bad enough ; but getting out ! I hardly 
know how I managed it. I had fully three feet to 
step down before reaching the wheel ; once there, the 
driver picked me up and set me on the pavement. 
The net I had gathered my hair in, fell in my descent, 
and my hair swept down halfway between my knee 
and ankle in one stream. As I turned to get my little 
bundle, the officers had moved their position to one 
directly opposite to me, where they could examine 
me at leisure. Queens used to ride drawn by oxen 
hundreds of years ago, so I played this was old times, 
the mules were oxen, I a queen, and stalked off in a 
style I am satisfied would have imposed on June 
herself. When I saw them as I turned, they were 
perfectly quiet; but Nettie says up to that moment 
they had been in convulsions of laughter, with their 
handkerchiefs to their faces. It was not polite! 
</p><p>
I found mother safe, but the house was in the most 
horrible confusion. Jimmy's empty cage stood by 
the door; it had the same effect on me that empty 
coffins produce on others. Oh, my birdie ! At six, I 
could no longer stand my hunger. I had fasted for 
twelve hours, with the exception of a mouthful of hoecake at eleven ; I that never fasted in my life ! except last Ash Wednesday when Lydia and I tried it 
for breakfast, and got so sick we were glad to atone 
for it at dinner. So I got a little piece of bread and 
corn beef from Mrs. Daigre's servant, for there was 
not a morsel here, and I did not know where or what 
to buy. Presently some kind friend sent me a great 
short-cake, a dish of strawberry preserves, and some 
butter, which I was grateful for, for the fact that 
the old negro was giving me part of her supper made 
me rather sparing, though she cried, "Eat it all, 
honey! I get plenty more!" 
</p><p>
Mother went to Cousin Will's, and I went to Mrs. Brunot's to sleep, and so ended my first day's ride 
on a mule team. Bah! A lady can make anything 
respectable by the way she does it! What do I care 
if I had been driving mules? Better that than walk 
seventeen miles.

I met Dr. DuChene and Dr. Castleton twice each, this morning. They were as kind to me as they 
were to the girls the other day. The latter saved 
them a disagreeable visit, while here. He and those 
three were packing some things in the hall, when 
two officers passed, and prepared to come in, seeing 
three good-looking girls seemingly alone, for Miriam's dress hid Dr. Castleton as he leaned over the 
box. Just then she moved, the Doctor raised his 
head, and the officers started back with an "Ah!" 
of surprise. The Doctor called them as they turned 
away, and asked for a pass for the young ladies. 
They came back bowing and smiling, said they would 
write one in the house, but they were told very 
dryly that there were no writing accommodations 
there. They tried the fascinating, and were much 
mortified by the coldness they met. Dear me! 
"Why wasn't I born old and ugly?" Suppose I 
should unconsciously entrap some magnificent Yankee ! What an awful thing it would be ! ! 
</p><p>
Sentinels are stationed at every corner; Dr. Castleton piloted me safely through one expedition ; 
but on the next, we had to part company, and I 
passed through a crowd of at least fifty, alone. They 
were playing cards in the ditch, and swearing dread 
fully, these pious Yankees; many were marching 
up and down, some sleeping on the pavement, others 
picking odious bugs out of each other's heads ! I 
thought of the guerrillas, yellow fever, and all, and 
wished they were all safe at home with their mothers and sisters, and we at peace again. 
What a day I have had ! Here mother and I are 
alone, not a servant on the lot. We will sleep here 
to-night, and I know she will be too nervous to let 
me sleep. The dirt and confusion were extraordinary 
in the house. I could not stand it, so I applied my 
self to making it better. I actually swept two whole 
rooms ! I ruined my hands at gardening, so it made 
no difference. I replaced piles of books, crockery, 
china, that Miriam had left packed for <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a>; 
I discovered I could empty a dirty hearth, dust, 
move heavy weights, make myself generally useful 
and dirty, and all this is thanks to the Yankees! 
Poor me! This time last year I thought I would 
never walk again ! If I am not laid up forever after 
the fatigue of this last week, I shall always maintain I have a Constitution. But it all seems nothing 
in this confusion; everything is almost as bad as 
ever. Besides that, I have been flying around to get 
Miriam a wagon. I know she is half distracted at 
being there alone. Mother chose staying with all 
its evils. Charlie's life would pay the penalty of a 
cotton burner if he returned, so Lilly remains at 
<a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a> with him. We three will get on as best 
we can here. I wrote to the country to get a wagon, 
sent a pass from Headquarters, but I will never know 
if it reached her until I see her in town. I hope it will ; 
I would be better satisfied with Miriam.
