Yesterday I was interrupted to undertake a very 
important task. The evening before, mother and 
Lilly happened to be in a store where two officers 
were buying materials for making shirts, and volunteered to make them for them, which offer they 
gladly accepted, though neither party knew the 
other. They saw that they were friends of Charlie, 
so had no scruples about offering their services ; the 
gentlemen saw that they were ladies, and very kind 
ones, besides, so made no difficulty about accepting. 
Lilly undertook one of purple merino, and I took a 
dark blue one. Miriam nominally helped her; but 
her very sore finger did not allow her to do much. 
Mother slightly assisted me; but I think Lilly and I 
had the best of the task. All day we worked, and 
when evening came, continued sewing by the light 
of these miserable home-made candles. Even then 
we could not finish, but had to get up early this 
morning, as the gentlemen were to leave for Port 
Hudson at nine o clock. We finished in good time, 
and their appearance recompensed us for our 
trouble. Lilly's was trimmed with folds of blue 
from mine, around collar, cuffs, pockets, and down 
the front band; while mine was pronounced a 
<em>chef d'Ã¦uvre</em>, trimmed with bias folds of tiny red and 
black plaid. With their fresh colors and shining 
pearl buttons, they were really very pretty. We 
sent word that we would be happy to make as many 
as they chose for themselves or their friends, and the 
eldest, with many fears that it was an "imposition" 
and we were "too good," and much more of the same 
kind, left another one with Charlie for us. We cannot 
do too much, or even enough, for our soldiers. I 
believe that is the universal sentiment of the women 
of the South.

Well, but how did we get back here? I hardly 
know. It seems to me we are being swayed by some 
kind of destiny which impels us here or there, with 
neither rhyme nor reason, and whether we will or no. 
Such homeless, aimless, purposeless, wandering 
individuals are rarely seen. From one hour to an 
other, we do not know what is to become of us. We 
talk vaguely of going home "when the Yankees go 
away." When will that be? One day there is not a 
boat in sight; the next, two or three stand off from 
shore to see what is being done, ready, at the first 
sight of warlike preparation, to burn the town down. 
It is particularly unsafe since the news from Virginia, when the gunboats started from Bayou Goula, 
shelling the coast at random, and destroying every 
thing that was within reach, report says. Of course, 
we cannot return to our homes when commissioned 
officers are playing the part of pirates, burning, 
plundering, and destroying at will, with neither law 
nor reason. Donaldsonville they burned before I 
left <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, because some fool fired a shotgun 
at a gunboat some miles above; Bayou Sara they 
burned while we were at General Carter's, for some 
equally reasonable excuse. The fate of <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> 
hangs on a still more slender thread. I would give 
worlds if it were all over. 
</p><p>
At Mrs. Haynes's we remained all night, as she 
sent the carriage back without consulting us. Monday we came to town and spent the day with Lilly. 
How it was, I can't say; but we came to the conclusion that it was best to quit our then residence, and 
either go back to <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> or to a Mrs. Somebody 
who offered to take us as boarders. We went back 
to Mrs. McCay's, to tell her of our determination, 
and in the morning took leave of her and came back home. 
</p><p>
We hear so much news, piece by piece, that one 
would imagine some definite result would follow, 
and bring us Peace before long. The Virginia news, 
after being so great and cheering, has suddenly 
ceased to come. No one knows the final result. The 
last report was that we held <a href='/results.php?city=arlington' rel='city'>Arlington</a> Heights. 
Why not Washington, consequently? <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a> 
(at last accounts) lay at our mercy. From Covington, Kirby Smith had sent over a demand for its 
surrender in two hours. Would it not be glorious to 
avenge <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> by such a blow? But since last 
night the telegraph is silent. 
</p><p>
News has just come of some nice little affair between our militia in Opelousas and the Yankees 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, in which we gave them a good 
thrashing, besides capturing arms, prisoners, and 
ammunition. "It never rains but it pours" is 
George's favorite proverb. With it comes the 
"rumor" that the Yankees are preparing to evacuate the city. If it could be! Oh, if God would only 
send them back to their own country, and leave 
ours in peace! I wish them no greater punishment 
than that they may be returned to their own homes, 
with the disgrace of their outrages here ever before 
their eyes. That would kill an honest man, I am 
sure.
