Another pleasant excitement. News has just arrived that Scott's cavalry was having a hard fight 
with the Yankees eight miles from town. Everybody immediately commenced to pick up stray articles, 
and get ready to .fly, in spite of the intense heat. I am resigned, as I hardly expect a shelling. Another 
report places the fight fourteen miles from here. A man on horseback came in for reinforcements. Heaven 
help poor Howell, if it is true. I am beginning to 
doubt half I hear. People tell me the most extravagant things, and if I am fool enough to believe them 
and repeat them, I suddenly discover that it is not half so true as it might be, and as they themselves 
frequently deny having told it, all the odium of "manufacturing" rests on my shoulders, which have 
not been accustomed to bear lies of any kind. I mean to cease believing anything, unless it rests on the 
word of some responsible person. By the way the order I so confidently believed, concerning the 
proclamation, turns out not quite so bad. I was told women were included, and it extended to private 
houses as well as public ones, though I fortunately omitted that when I recorded it. When I read it, it 
said, "All discussions concerning the war are prohibited in bar-rooms, public assemblies, and street 
corners." As women do not frequent such places, and private houses are not mentioned, I cannot imagine 
how my informant made the mistake, unless, like me, it was through hearing it repeated. Odious as 
I thought it then, I think it wise now; for more than one man has lost his life through discussions of the kind.
