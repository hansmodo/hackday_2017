A letter from my dear little Jimmy ! How glad I am, words could not express. This is the first since 
he arrived in England, and now we know what has become of him at last. While awaiting the 
completion of the ironclad gunboat to which he has been appointed, like a trump he has put him 
self to school, and studies hard, which is evident from the great improvement he already exhibits in his letter. . . .

My delight at hearing from Jimmy is overcast by the bad news Lilly sends of mother's health. I have 
been unhappy about her for a long while ; her health has been wretched for three months; so bad, that 
during all my long illness she has never been with me after the third day. I was never separated from 
mother for so long before ; and I am homesick, and heartsick about her. Only twenty miles apart, and 
she with a shocking bone felon in her hand and that dreadful cough, unable to come to me, whilst I am 
lying helpless here, as unable to get to her. I feel right desperate about it. This evening Lilly writes 
of her having chills and fevers, and looking very, very badly. So Miriam started off instantly to see her. 
My poor mother ! She will die if she stays in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, I know she will !
