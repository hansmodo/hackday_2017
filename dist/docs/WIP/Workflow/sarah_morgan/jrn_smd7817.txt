I was interrupted so frequently yesterday that I 
know not how I continued to write so much. First, 
I was sent for, to go to Mrs. Brunot, who had just 
heard of her son's death, and who was alone with Dena; and some hours after, I was sent for, to see 
Fanny, now Mrs. Trezevant, who had just come with 
her husband to bring us news of George. A Mrs. Montgomery, who saw him every day at Norfolk, said 
Jimmy was with him, and though very sick at first, 
was now in good health. The first news in all that 
long time! When the city was evacuated, George 
went with his regiment seven miles from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, 
Jimmy to the city itself, as aide to Com. Hollins. 
This lady brought George's opal ring and diamond 
pin. Howell andJVlr. Badger, who had just joined the 
guerrillas as independents, spent the day with me. 
We were all in such confusion that I felt ashamed : 
every one as dirty as possible ; I had on the same dress 
I had escaped in, which, though then perfectly clean, 
was now rather dirty. But they knew what a time 
we had had.

To return to my journal. 
</p><p>
Lucy met mother some long way ahead of us, 
whose conscience was already reproaching her for 
leaving us, and in answer to her "What has become 
of my poor girls?" ran down the road to find us, for 
Lucy thinks the world can't keep on moving with 
out us. When she met us, she walked by the cart, 
and it was with difficulty we persuaded her to ride 
a mile; she said she felt "used" to walking now. 
About five miles from home, we overtook mother. 
The gentleman had been obliged to go for his wife, so 
Mary gave her her seat on the cart, and walked with 
Lucy three miles beyond, where we heard that Lilly 
and the children had arrived in a cart, early in the 
day. All the talk by the roadside was of burning 
homes, houses knocked to pieces by balls, famine, 
murder, desolation; so I comforted myself singing, 
" Better days are coming" and " I hope to die shout 
ing, the Lord will provide"; while Lucy toiled 
through the sun and dust, and answered with a 
chorus of "I m a-runnin , a-runnin up to glo-ry!" 
</p><p>
It was three o'clock when we reached Mr. David's 
and found Lilly. How warm and tired we were ! A 
hasty meal, which tasted like a feast after our 
fatigue, gave us fresh strength, and Lilly and 
Miriam got in an old cart with the children to drive 
out here, leaving me with mother and Dellie to 
follow next day. About sunset, Charlie came flying 
down the road, on his way to town. I decided to go, 
and after an obstinate debate with mother, in which 
I am afraid I showed more determination than amiability, I wrung a reluctant consent from her, and, 
promising not to enter if it was being fired or plundered, drove off in triumph. It was a desperate enterprise for a young girl, to enter a town full of soldiers 
on such an expedition at night ; but I knew Charlie 
could take care of me, and if he was killed I could 
take care of myself; so I went. 
</p><p>
It was long after nine when we got there, and my 
first act was to look around the deserted house. 
What a scene of confusion! armoirs spread open, 
with clothes tumbled in every direction, inside and 
out ; ribbons, laces on floors ; chairs overturned ; my 
desk wide open covered with letters, trinkets, etc. ; 
bureau drawers half out, the bed filled with odds 
and ends of everything. I no longer recognized my 
little room. On the bolster was a little box, at the 
sight of which I burst out laughing. Five minutes 
before the alarm, Miriam had been selecting those 
articles she meant to take to <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a>, and, holding 
up her box, said, " If we were forced to run for our 
lives without a moment's warning, I d risk my life 
to save this, rather than leave it!" Yet here lay the 
box, and she was safe at <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a> ! 
It took me two hours to pack father's papers, then 
I packed Miriam's trunk, then some of mother's and 
mine, listening all the while for a cannon; for men 
were constantly tramping past the house, and only 
on condition our guerrillas did not disturb them had 
they promised not to recommence the shelling. 
Charlie went out to hear the news, and I packed 
alone. 
</p><p>
It seems the only thing that saved the town was 
two gentlemen who rowed out to the ships, and in 
formed the illustrious commander that there were no 
men there to be hurt, and he was only killing women 
and children. The answer was, "He was sorry he 
had hurt them; he thought of course the town had 
been evacuated before the men were fools enough 
to fire on them, and had only shelled the principal 
streets to intimidate the people." These streets were 
the very ones crowded with flying women and child 
ren, which they must have seen with their own eyes, 
for those lying parallel to the river led to the Garrison 
at one end and the crevasse at the other, which cut 
off all the lower roads, so that the streets he shelled 
were the only ones that the women could follow, unless they wished to be drowned. As for the firing, four 
guerrillas were rash enough to fire on a yawl which 
was about to land without a flag of truce, killing 
one, wounding three, one of whom afterwards died. 
</p><p>
They were the only ones in town, there was not a 
cannon in our hands, even if a dozen men could be 
collected, and this cannonading was kept up in return 
for half a dozen shots from as many rifles, without 
even a show of resistance after! So ended the momentous shelling of <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, during which the 
valiant Farragut killed one whole woman, wounded 
three, struck some twenty houses several times 
apiece, and indirectly caused the death of two little 
children who were drowned in their flight, one poor 
little baby that was born in the woods, and several 
cases of the same kind, besides those who will yet die 
from the fatigue, as Mrs. W. D. Phillips who had not 
left her room since January, who was carried out in 
her nightgown, and is now supposed to be in a dying 
condition. The man who took mother told us he had 
taken a dying woman in the act of expiring in 
his buggy, from her bed, and had left her a little 
way off, where she had probably breathed her last a 
few moments after. There were many similar cases. 
Hurrah for the illustrious Farragut, the Woman Killer! ! ! 
</p><p>
It was three o'clock before I left off packing, and 
took refuge in a tub of cold water, from the dust and 
heat of the morning. What a luxury the water was ! 
and when I changed my underclothes I felt like a new 
being. To be sure I pulled off the skin of my heel 
entirely, where it had been blistered by the walk, 
dust, sun, etc., but that was a trifle, though still 
quite sore now. For three hours I dreamed of rifled 
shells and battles, and at half -past six I was up and 
at work again. Mother came soon after, and after 
hard work we got safely off at three, saving nothing 
but our clothes and silver. All else is gone. It cost 
me a pang to leave my guitar, and Miriam's piano, 
but it seems there was no help for it, so I had to 
submit. 
</p><p>
It was dark night when we reached here. A bright 
fire was blazing in front, but the house looked so 
desolate that I wanted to cry. Miriam cried when I 
told her her piano was left behind. Supper was a 
new sensation, after having been without anything 
except a glass of clabber (no saucers) and a piece of 
bread since half-past six. I laid down on the hard 
floor to rest my weary bones, thankful that I was so 
fortunate as to be able to lie down at all. In my 
dozing state, I heard the wagon come, and Miriam 
ordering a mattress to be put in the room for me. I 
could make out, "Very well! you may take that one 
to Miss Eliza, 1 but the next one shall be brought to 
Miss Sarah!" Poor Miriam! She is always fighting 
my battles. She and the servants are always taking 
my part against the rest of the world. . . . She and 
Lucy made a bed and rolled me in it with no more 
questions, and left me with damp eyes at the thought 
of how good and tender every one is to me. Poor 
Lucy picked me a dish of blackberries to await my 
arrival, and I was just as grateful for it, though they 
were eaten by some one else before I came. 
</p><p>
Early yesterday morning, Miriam, Nettie, and Sophie, who did not then know of their brother's 
death, went to town in a cart, determined to save some things, Miriam to save her piano. As soon as 
they were halfway, news reached us that any one 
was allowed to enter, but none allowed to leave the 
town, and all vehicles confiscated as soon as they 
reached there. Alarmed for their safety, mother 
started off to find them, and we have heard of none of 
them since. What will happen next? I am not uneasy. 
They dare not harm them. It is glorious to shell a 
town full of women, but to kill four lone ones is not exciting enough.
