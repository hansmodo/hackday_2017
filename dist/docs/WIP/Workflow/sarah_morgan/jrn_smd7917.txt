My cripple friend that I mentioned so far back 
continues to send me the most affecting messages. 
"He is really wretched about me; never was more 
distressed ; thinks of nothing else " ; and so on through 
the whole list. To cap the climax, he sends me word 
that he can now walk on crutches, and the first time 
he can venture in a buggy, means to call on me. 
Que le del irien preserve I What could we talk about? 
"His n" and "her n" several misfortunes? That's 
too bad! Every one teases me unmercifully about 
my new conquest. I can't help but be amused; and 
yet, beware, young girls, of expressing sympathy, 
even for soldiers! There is no knowing what effect 
it may produce.
