THERE is no use in trying to break off journalizing, particularly in "these trying times." It has become 
a necessity to me. I believe I should go off in a rapid decline if Butler took it in his head to prohibit that 
among other things. ... I reserve to myself the privilege of writing my opinions, since I trouble no 
one with the expression of them. ... I insist, that if the valor and chivalry of our men cannot save our 
country, I would rather have it conquered by a brave race than owe its liberty to the Billingsgate oratory 
and demonstrations of some of these ladies. If the women have the upper hand then, as they have now, 
I would not like to live in a country governed by such tongues. Do I consider the female who could 
spit in a gentleman's face, merely because he wore United States buttons, as a fit associate for me? 
Lieutenant Biddle assured me he did not pass a street 
in <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> without being most grossly insulted 
by ladies. It was a friend of his into whose face a lady spit as he walked quietly by without looking at 
her. (Wonder if she did it to attract his attention?) He had the sense to apply to her husband and give 
him two minutes to apologize or die, and of course he chose the former. 1 Such things are enough to disgust 
any one. "Loud" women, what a contempt I have for you! How I despise your vulgarity!

Some of these Ultra-Secessionists, evidently very recently from "down East," who think themselves 
obliged to "kick up their heels over the Bonny Blue Flag," as Brother describes female patriotism, shriek 
out, "What! see those vile Northerners pass patiently! No true Southerner could see it without 
rage. I could kill them! I hate them with all my soul, the murderers, liars, thieves, rascals! You are 
no Southerner if you do not hate them as much as I!" Ah a! a true-blue Yankee tell me that I, born 
and bred here, am no Southerner! I always think, "It is well for you, my friend, to save your credit, 
else you might be suspected by some people, though your violence is enough for me." I always say, " You 
may do as you please; my brothers are fighting for me, and doing their duty, so that excess of patriotism is unnecessary for me, as my position is too well 
known to make any demonstrations requisite."

This war has brought out wicked, malignant feelings that I did not believe could dwell in woman's 
heart. I see some of the holiest eyes, so holy one 
would think the very spirit of charity lived in them, 
and all Christian meekness, go off in a mad tirade 
of abuse and say, with the holy eyes wondrously changed, " I hope God will send down plague, yellow 
fever, famine, on these vile Yankees, and that not 
one will escape death." O, what unutterable horror 
that remark causes me as often as I hear it! I think 
of the many mothers, wives, and sisters who wait as 
anxiously, pray as fervently in their faraway homes 
for their dear ones, as we do here; I fancy them waiting day after day for the footsteps that will never 
come, growing more sad, lonely, and heart-broken 
as the days wear on ; I think of how awful it would be 
if one would say, "Your brothers are dead"; how 
it would crush all life and happiness out of me; and 
I say, "God forgive these poor women! They know 
not what they say!" O women! into what loath 
some violence you have abased your holy mission! 
God will punish us for our hard-heartedness. Not a 
square off, in the new theatre, lie more than a hundred sick soldiers. What woman has stretched out 
her hand to save them, to give them a cup of cold 
water? Where is the charity which should ignore nations and creeds, and administer help to the Indian 
and-Heathen indifferently? Gone! All gone in Union 
versus Secession! That is what the American War 
has brought us. If I was independent, if I could work 
my own will without causing others to suffer for my 
deeds, I would not be poring over this stupid page; 
I would not be idly reading or sewing. I would put 
aside woman's trash, take up woman's duty, and 
I would stand by some forsaken man and bid him 
Godspeed as he closes his dying eyes. That is 
woman's mission! and not Preaching and Politics. I 
say I would, yet here I sit! O for liberty! the liberty 
that dares do what conscience dictates, and scorns 
all smaller rules! If I could help these dying men! 
Yet it is as impossible as though I was a chained 
bear. I can't put out my hand. I am threatened with 
Coventry because I sent a custard to a sick man who 
is in the army, and with the anathema of society 
because I said if I could possibly do anything for 
Mr. Biddle at a distance (he is sick) I would 
like to very much. Charlie thinks we have acted 
shockingly in helping Colonel McMillan, and that 
we will suffer for it when the Federals leave. I would 
like to see any man who dared harm my father's 
daughter! But as he seems to think our conduct reflects on him, there is no alternative. Die, poor men, 
without a woman's hand to close your eyes! We 
women are too patriotic to help you! I look eagerly 
on, cry in my soul, " I wish - " ; you die; God judges 
me. Behold the woman who dares not risk private 
ties for God's glory and her professed religion! 
Coward, helpless woman that I am! If I was free!
