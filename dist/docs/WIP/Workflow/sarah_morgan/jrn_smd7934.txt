I had so many nice things to say which now, 
alas, are knocked forever from my head. when 
news came that the Yankees were advancing on us, 
and were already within fifteen miles. The panic 
which followed reminded me forcibly of our running 
days in <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>. Each one rapidly threw into 
trunks all clothing worth saving, with silver and 
valuables, to send to the upper plantation. I sprang 
up, determined to leave instantly for <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> so 
mother would not be alarmed for our safety; but 
before I got halfway dressed, Helen Carter came in, 
and insisted on my remaining, declaring that my 
sickness and inability to move would prove a protection to the house, and save it from being burned 
over their heads. Put on that plea, though I have no 
faith in melting the bowels of compassion of a Yankee, myself, I consented to remain, as Miriam urgently represented the dangers awaiting <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>. 
So she tossed all we owned into our trunk to send to 
mother as hostage of our return, and it is now awaiting the cars. My earthly possessions are all reposing 
by me on the bed at this instant, consisting of my 
guitar, a change of clothes, running-bag, cabas, and 
this book. For in spite of their entreaties, I would 
not send it to <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, expecting those already there 
to meet with a fiery death though I would like 
to preserve those of the most exciting year of my 
life. They tell me that this will be read aloud to me 
to torment me, but I am determined to burn it if 
there is any danger of that. Why, I would die with 
out some means of expressing my feelings in the 
stirring hours so rapidly approaching. I shall keep 
it by me.

Such bustle and confusion! Every one hurried, 
anxious, excited, whispering, packing trunks, sending them off; wondering negroes looking on in 
amazement until ordered to mount the carts waiting 
at the door, which are to carry them too away. How 
disappointed the Yankees will be at finding only 
white girls instead of their dear sisters and brothers 
whom they love so tenderly! Sorry for their disappointment !

"They say " they are advancing in overwhelming 
numbers. That is nothing, so long as God helps us, 
and from our very souls we pray His blessing on us in 
this our hour of need. For myself, I cannot yet fully 
believe they are coming. It would be a relief to have 
it over. I have taken the responsibility of Lydia's 
jewelry on my shoulders, and hope to be able to 
save it in the rush which will take place. Down at 
the cars Miriam met Frank Enders, going to <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> 
in charge of a car full of Yankees, deserters, who 
came into our lines. He thinks, just as I do, that our 
trunks are safer here than there. Now that they are 
all off, we all agree that it was the most foolish thing 
we could have done. These Yankees interfere with 
all our arrangements.

I am almost ashamed to confess what an absurdly selfish thought occurred to me a while ago. I was 
lamenting to myself all the troubles that surround 
us, the dangers and difficulties that perplex us, thinking of the probable fate that might befall some of our 
brave friends and defenders in Port Hudson, when 
I thought, too, of the fun we would miss. Horrid, 
was it not? But worse than that, I was longing for 
something to read, when I remembered Frank told 
me he had sent to <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a> for Bulwer's "Strange 
Story" for me, and then I unconsciously said, "How 
I wish it would get here before the Yankees!" I am 
very anxious to read it, but confess I am ashamed of 
having thought of it at such a crisis. So I toss up the 
farthing Frank gave me for a keepsake the other day, 
and say I'll try in future to think less of my own 
comfort and pleasure.

Poor Mr. Halsey! What a sad fate the pets he 
procures for me meet! He stopped here just now on 
his way somewhere, and sent me a curious bundle 
with a strange story, by Miriam. It seems he got a 
little flying-squirrel for me to play with (must know 
my partiality for pets), and last night, while attempting to tame him, the little creature bit his finger, 
whereupon he naturally let him fall on the ground, 
(Temper!) which put a period to his existence. He 
had the nerve to skin him after the foul murder, and 
sent all that remains of him out to me to prove his 
original intention. The softest, longest, prettiest 
fur, and such a duck of a tail! Poor little animal 
couldn't have been larger than my fist. Wonder if 
its spirit will meet with that of the little bird which 
flew heavenward with all that pink ribbon and my 
letter from Mr. Halsey?
