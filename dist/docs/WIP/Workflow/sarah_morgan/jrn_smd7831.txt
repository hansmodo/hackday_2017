Yesterday morning, just as I stepped out of bed 
I heard the report of four cannon fired in rapid succession, and everybody asked everybody else, "Did 
you hear that?" so significantly, that I must say my heart beat very rapidly for a few moments, at the 
thought of another stampede. At half-past six this morning I was wakened by another report, followed 
by seven others, and heard again the question, " Did you hear that?" on a higher key than yesterday. It did not take me many minutes to get out of bed, and to slip on a few articles, I confess. My chief de 
sire was to wash my face before running, if they were actually shelling us again. It appears that they were 
only practicing, however, and no harm was intended. But we are living on such a volcano, that, not knowing what to expect, we are rather nervous.

I am afraid this close confinement will prove too much for me ; my long walks are cut off, on account 
of the soldiers. One month to-morrow since my last visit to the graveyard! That haunts me always; it 
must be so dreary out there ! Here is a sketch of my daily life, enough to finish me off forever, if much longer persisted in. 
</p><p>
First, get up a little before seven. After breakfast, 
which is generally within a few minutes after I get 
down (it used to be just as I got ready, and some 
times before, last winter), I attend to my garden, 
which consists of two strips of ground the length 
of the house, in front, where I can find an hour's 
work in examining and admiring my flowers, replanting those that the cows and horses occasionally 
(once a day) pull up for me, and in turning the soil 
over and over again to see which side grows best. 
O my garden! abode of rare delights! how many 
pleasant hours I have passed in you, armed with 
scissors, knife, hoe, or rake, only pausing when Mr. This or Mr. That leaned over the fence to have a 
talk ! last spring, that was ; ever so many are dead 
now, for all I know, and all off at the war. Now I 
work for the edification of proper young women, who 
look in astonishment at me, as they would consider themselves degraded by the pursuit. A deli 
cate pair of hands my flower mania will leave me ! 
</p><p>
Then I hear Dellie's and Morgan's lessons, after 
which I open my desk and am lost in the mysteries 
of Arithmetic, Geography, Blair's Lectures, Noel et Chapsal, Ollendorff, and reading aloud in French and 
English, besides writing occasionally in each, and 
sometimes a peep at Lavoisne, until very nearly 
dinner. The day is not half long enough for me. 
Many things I would like to study I am forced to 
give up, for want of leisure to devote to them. But 
one of these days, I will make up for present deficiencies. I study only what I absolutely love, now; 
but then, if I can, I will study what I am at present 
ignorant of, and cultivate a taste for something new. 
</p><p>
The few moments before dinner, and all the time 
after, I devote to writing, sewing, knitting, etc., 
and if I included darning, repairs, alterations, etc., 
my list would be tremendous, for I get through with 
a great deal of sewing. Somewhere in the day, I find 
half an hour, or more, to spend at the piano. Before 
sunset I dress, and am free to spend the evening at 
home, or else walk to Mrs. Brunot's, for it is not safe 
to go farther than those three squares, away from 
home. From early twilight until supper, Miriam and 
I sing with the guitar, generally, and after, sit comfortably under the chandelier and read until about 
ten. What little reading I do, is almost exclusively 
done at that time. It sounds woefully little, but my 
list of books grows to quite a respectable size, in 
the course of a year. 
</p><p>
At ten comes my Bible class for the servants. 
Lucy, Rose, Nancy, and Dophy assemble in my 
room, and hear me read the Bible, or stories from the 
Bible for a while. Then one by one say their prayers 
they cannot be persuaded to say them together ; Dophy says "she can't say with Rose, cause she ain't got no brothers and sisters to pray for," and 
Lucy has no father or mother, and so they go. All 
difficulties and grievances during the day are laid 
before me, and I sit like Moses judging the children 
of Israel, until I can appease the discord. Sometimes 
it is not so easy. For instance, that memorable night 
when I had to work Rose's stubborn heart to a proper 
pitch of repentance for having stabbed a carving-fork in Lucy's arm in a fit of temper. I don't know 
that I was ever as much astonished as I was at seeing the dogged, sullen girl throw herself on the 
floor in a burst of tears, and say if God would for 
give her she would never do it again. I was lashing 
myself internally for not being able to speak as I 
should, furious at myself for talking so weakly, and 
lo! here the girl tumbles over wailing and weeping! 
And Dophy, overcome by her feelings, sobs, "Lucy, 
I scratched you last week! please forgive me this 
once! * And amazed and bewildered I look at the 
touching tableau before me of kissing and reconciliation, for Lucy can bear malice toward no one, and 
is ready to forgive before others repent, and I look 
from one to the other, wondering what it was that 
upset them so completely, for certainly no words 
of mine caused it. Sometimes Lucy sings a wild 
hymn, "Did you ever hear the heaven bells ring?" 
"Come, my loving brothers," "When I put on my 
starry crown," etc.; and after some such scene as 
that just described, it is pleasant to hear them going out of the room saying, "Good-night, Miss Sarah!" "God bless Miss Sarah!" and all that.
