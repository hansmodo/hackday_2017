Another day of sickening suspense. This evening, 
about three, came the rumor that there was to be 
an attack on the town to-night, or early in the morning, and we had best be prepared for anything. I 
can't say I believe it, but in spite of my distrust, I 
made my preparations. First of all I made a charming improvement in my knapsack, alias pillow-case, 
by sewing a strong black band down each side of the 
centre from the bottom to the top, when it is carried 
back and fastened below again, allowing me to pass my 
arms through, and thus present the appearance of an 
old peddler. Miriam's I secured also, and tied all our 
laces in a handkerchief ready to lay it in the last thing. 
But the interior of my bag! what a medley it is! 
First, I believe, I have secured four underskirts, 
three chemises, as many pairs of stockings, two underbodies, the prayer book father gave me, "Tennyson " 
that Harry gave me when I was fourteen, two unmade 
muslins, a white mull, English grenadine trimmed 
with lilac, and a purple linen, and nightgown. 
Then, I must have Lavinia's daguerreotype, and 
how could I leave Will's, when perhaps he was dead? 
Besides, Howell's and Will Carter's were with him, 
and one single case did not matter. But there was 
Tom Barker's I would like to keep, and oh! let's 
take Mr. Stone s! and I can't slight Mr. Dunnington, 
for these two have been too kind to Jimmy for me 
to forget; and poor Captain Huger is dead, and I will 
keep his, so they all went together. A box of pens, 
too, was indispensable, and a case of French notepaper, and a bundle of Harry's letters were added. 
Miriam insisted on the old diary that preceded this, 
and found place for it, though I am afraid if she knew 
what trash she was to carry, she would retract before 
going farther. 
It makes me heartsick to see the utter ruin we will 
be plunged in if forced to run to-night. Not a hundredth part of what I most value can be saved if 
I counted my letters and papers, not a thousandth. 
But I cannot believe we will run to-night. The soldiers tell whoever questions them that there will be 
a fight before morning, but I believe it must be to 
alarm them. Though what looks suspicious is, that 
the officers said to whom is not stated that the 
ladies must not be uneasy if they heard cannon to 
night, as they would probably commence to celebrate the Fourth of July about twelve o clock. What 
does it mean? I repeat, I don't believe a word of it; 
yet I have not yet met the woman or child who is not 
prepared to fly. Rose knocked at the door just now 
to show her preparations. Her only thought seems 
to be mother's silver, so she has quietly taken possession of our shoe-bag, which is a long sack for odds 
and ends with cases for shoes outside, and has filled 
it with all the contents of the silver- box; this hung 
over her arm, and carrying Louis and Sarah, this 
young Samson says she will be ready to fly.

I don't believe it, yet here I sit, my knapsack serving me for a desk, my seat the chair on which 
I have carefully spread my clothes in order. At my elbow lies my running- or treasure-bag, surrounded 
by my cabas filled with hair-pins, starch, and a band I was embroidering, etc.; near it lie our combs, etc., and the whole is crowned by my dagger ; by the 
way, I must add Miriam's pistol which she has forgotten, though over there lies her knapsack ready, too, with our bonnets and veils. 
</p><p>
It is long past eleven, and no sound of the cannon. Bah! I do not expect it. "I 11 lay me down and sleep 
in peace, for Thou only, Lord, makest me to dwell in safety." Good-night! I wake up to-morrow the same as usual, and be disappointed that my trouble was unnecessary.
