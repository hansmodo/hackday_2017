I don't mean those ladies were, but that I am at present. I'll account for it after I have disposed of 
the stampede. Imagine no interruption, and continue in the carriage urging Uncle Will to hurry 
on, and I had hardly time to thrust my sack under their feet before they were off. Lilly and Miss Walters were already in the buggy, leaving Ginnie and 
me to follow on horseback. I ran up after my riding-skirt, which I was surprised to find behind a trunk, 
and rolled up in it was my running-bag, with all my treasures! I was very much provoked at my carelessness; indeed, I cannot imagine how it got there, 
for it was the first thing I thought of. When I got back, there was no one to be seen except Ginnie and 
two negroes who held our horses, and who disappeared the instant we were mounted; with the exception of two women who were running to the woods, 
we were the only ones on the lot, until Mr. Watson galloped up to urge us on. Again I had to notice this 
peculiarity about women that the married ones are invariably the first to fly, in time of danger, and 
always leave the young ones to take care of themselves. Here were our three matrons, prophesying 
that the house would be burnt, the Yankees upon us, and all murdered in ten minutes, flying down the Guerrilla Lane, and leaving us to encounter the horrors they foretold, alone. 
</p><p>
It was a splendid gallop in the bright moonlight, 
over the fields, only it was made uncomfortable by the 
jerking of my running-bag, until I happily thought 
of turning it before. A hard ride of four miles in 
about twenty minutes brought us to the house of the 
man who so kindly offered his hospitality. It was a 
little hut, about as large as our parlor, and already 
crowded to overflowing, as he was entertaining 
three families from <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>. can't imagine 
where he put them, either. But it seems to me the 
poorer the man, and the smaller the house, the greater 
the hospitality you meet with. There were so many 
of us that there was not room on the balcony to turn. 
The man wanted to prepare supper, but we declined, 
as Phillie had sent back for ours which we had missed. 
</p><p>
I saw another instance of the pleasure the vulgar take in the horrible. A Mr. Hill, speaking of Dr. Nolan, told Phillie "he had no doubt he had been 
sent to <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> on the Whiteman, that carried General Williams's body; and that every soul had 
gone down on her." Fortunately, just then the overseer brought a letter from him saying he had 
gone on another boat, or the man's relish of the distressing might have been gratified. 
</p><p>
It was so crowded there that we soon suggested 
going a short distance beyond, to Mr. Lobdell's, 
and staying there for the night, as all strenuously 
objected to our returning home, as there was danger 
from prowling Yankees. So we mounted again, and 
after a short ride we reached the house, where all 
were evidently asleep. But necessity knows no rules ; 
and the driver soon aroused an old gentleman who 
came out and invited us in. A middle-aged lady met 
us, and made us perfectly at home by leaving us to 
take care of ourselves; most people would have 
thought it indifference; but I knew it was manque de savoir-faire, merely, and preferred doing as I pleased. 
If she had been officious, I would have been embarrassed. So we walked in the moonlight, Ginnie 
and I, while the rest sat in the shade, and all discussed 
the fun of the evening, those who had been most 
alarmed laughing loudest. The old gentleman insisted that we girls had been the cause of it all ; that 
our white bodies (I wore a Russian shirt) and black 
skirts could easily have caused us to be mistaken for 
men. That, at all events, three or four people on 
horseback would be a sufficient pretext for firing 
a shell or two. "In short, young ladies," he said, 
"there is no doubt in my mind that you were mistaken for guerrillas, and that they only wanted to 
give you time to reach the woods where they heard 
they have a camp, before shooting at you. In short, 
take my advice and never mount a horse again when 
there is a Yankee in sight." We were highly gratified at being mistaken for them, and pretended to 
believe it was true. I hardly think he was right, though; it is too preposterous. 
</p><p>
Pourtant, Sunday morning the Yankees told a negro they did not mean to touch the house, but were 
shooting at some guerrillas at a camp just beyond. We know the last guerrilla left the parish five days ago. 
</p><p>
Our host insisted on giving us supper, though Phillie represented that ours was on the road ; and by 
eleven o clock, tired alike of moonlight and fasting, we gladly accepted, and rapidly made the preserves 
and batter-cakes fly. Ours was a garret room, well finished, abounding in odd closets and corners, with 
curious dormer windows that were reached by long little corridors. I should have slept well; but I lay 
awake all night. Mother and I occupied a narrow 
single bed, with a bar of the thickest, heaviest material imaginable. Suffocation awaited me inside, 
gnats and mosquitoes outside. In order to be strictly impartial, I lay awake to divide my time 
equally between the two attractions, and think I succeeded pretty well. So I spent the night on the extreme edge of the bed, never turning over, but 
fanning mother constantly. I was not sorry when daybreak appeared, but dressed and ascended the observatory to get a breath of air. 
</p><p>
Below me, I beheld four wagons loaded with the young Mrs. Lobdell's baggage. The Yankees had 
visited them in the evening, swept off everything they could lay their hands on, and with a sick child 
she was obliged to leave her house in the night and 
fly to her father-in-law. I wondered at their allowing 
her four wagons of trunks and bundles; it was very 
kind. If I were a Federal, I think it would kill me 
to hear the whisper of "Hide the silver" wherever 
I came. Their having frequently relieved families 
of such trifles, along with negroes, teams, etc., has 
put others on their guard now. As I sat in the parlor 
in the early morning, Mrs. Walters en blouse volante 
and all echevelee, came in to tell me of Mr. Lobdell's 
misfortunes. "They took his negroes [right hand 
up]; his teams [left hand up]; his preserves [both 
hands clutching her hair] ; they swept off everything, 
except four old women who could not walk! they 
told him if he didn't come report himself, they d 
come fetch him in three days ! They beggared him ! " 
[Both eyes rolling like a ship in a storm.] I could not 
help laughing. Mr. Bird sat on the gallery, and had 
been served in the same way, with the addition of 
a pair of handcuffs for a little while. It was not a 
laughing matter; but the old lady made it comical 
by her gestures. 
</p><p>
When we suggested returning, there was another 
difficulty. All said it was madness ; that the Yankees 
would sack the house and burn it over our heads; 
we would be insulted, etc. I said no one yet had ever 
said an impudent thing to me, and Yankees certainly 
would not attempt it ; but the old gentleman told me 
I did not know what I was talking about ; so I hushed, 
but determined to return. Ginnie and I sat an hour 
on horseback waiting for the others to settle what 
they would do; and after having half-roasted our 
selves in the sun, they finally agreed to go, too, and 
we set off in a gallop which we never broke until we 
reached the house, which to our great delight we 
found standing, and not infested with Yankees.
