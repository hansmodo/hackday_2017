I have had a shock! While writing alone here 
(almost all have gone to church), I heard a step 
ascending the stair. What, I asked, if it should be 
Will? Then I blamed myself for supposing such a 
thing possible. Slowly it came nearer and nearer, 
I raised my head, and was greeted with a ghastly 
smile. I held out my hand. "Will!" "Sarah!" 
(Misery discards ceremony.) He stood before me 
the most woebegone, heartbroken man I ever saw. 
</p><p>
With a forced laugh he said, "Where is my bride? 
Pshaw! I know she has gone to <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>! I have 
come to talk to you. Wasn't it a merry wedding?" 
The hollow laugh rang again. I tried to jest, but 
failed. "Sit down and let me talk to you," I said. 
He was in a wayward humor ; cut to the heart, ready 
to submit to a touch of silk, or to resist a grasp of 
iron. This was the man I had to deal with, and get 
from him something he clung to as to not his life, 
but Miriam. And I know so little how to act in 
such a case, know so little about dealing gently with 
wild natures! 
</p><p>
He alarmed me at first. His forced laugh ceased ; 
he said that he meant to keep that license always. 
It was a joke on him yesterday, but with that in his 
possession, the tables would be turned on her. He 
would show it to her occasionally. It should keep 
her from marrying any one else. I said that it would 
be demanded, though; he must deliver it. The very 
devil shot in his eye as he exclaimed fiercely, "If 
any one dares demand it, I'll die before giving it 
up! If God Almighty came, I d say no! I'll die 
with it first!" O merciful Father, I thought; what 
misery is to come of this jest. He must relinquish 
it. Gibbes will force him into it, or die in the 
attempt; George would come from Virginia. . . . 
Jimmy would cross the seas. . . . And I was alone 
in here to deal with such a spirit! 
</p><p>
I commenced gently. Would he do Miriam such a 
wrong? It was no wrong, he said ; let him follow his 
own will. " You profess to love her? " I asked. " Profess? Great God! how can you? I adore her! I tell 
you that, in spite of all this, I love her not more - that is impossible, but as much as ever ! Look at 
my face and ask that ! " burst from him with the wildest impulse. "Very well. This girl you love, then, you 
mean to make miserable. You stand forever between her and her happiness, because you love her! Is 
this love ? " He was sullenly silent. I went on : " Not only her happiness, but her honor is concerned. 
You who love her so, do her this foul injury." 
"Would it affect her reputation?" he asked. "Ask 
yourself! Is it quite right that you should hold in 
your hands the evidence that she is Mrs. Carter, 
when you know she is not, and never will be? Is it 
quite honorable? " "In God's name, would it injure 
Miriam? I d rather die than grieve her." 
</p><p>
My iron was melted, but too hot to handle; I put 
it on one side, satisfied that I and I only had saved 
Miriam from injury and three brothers from blood 
shed, by using his insane love as a lever. It does 
not look as hard here as it was in reality ; but it was 
of the hardest struggles I ever had indeed, it was 
desperate. I had touched the right key, and satisfied 
of success, turned the subject to let him believe he 
was following his own suggestions. When I told him 
he must free Miriam from all blame, that I had 
encouraged the jest against her repeated remonstrances, and was alone to blame, he generously took 
it on himself. "I was so crazy about her," he said, 
"that I would have done it anyhow. I would have 
run any risk for the faintest chance of obtaining 
her"; and much more to the same purpose that, 
though very generous in him, did not satisfy my 
conscience. But he surprised me by saying that 
he was satisfied that if I had been in my room, and 
he had walked into the parlor with the license, she 
would have married him. What infatuation! He 
says, though, that I only prevented it; that my influence, by my mere presence, is stronger than his 
words. I don't say that is so; but if I helped save 
her, thank Heaven! 
</p><p>
It is impossible to say one half that passed, but 
he showed me his determination to act just as he has 
heretofore, and take it all as a joke, that no blame 
might be attached to her. "Besides, I d rather die 
than not see her; I laugh, but you don't know what 
I suffer!" Poor fellow! I saw it in his swimming 
eyes. 
</p><p>
At last he got up to go before they returned from 
church. "Beg her to meet me as she always has. 
I told Mrs. Worley that she must treat her just the 
same, because I love her so. And say I go to 
<a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> to-morrow to have that record effaced, and 
deliver up the license. I would not grieve her; in 
deed, I love her too well." His voice trembled as 
well as his lips. He took my hand, saying, "You 
are hard on me. I could make her happy, I know, 
because I worship her so. I have been crazy about 
her for three years; you can't call it a mere fancy. 
Why are you against me? But God bless you! 
Good-bye!" And he was gone. 
</p><p>
Why? O Will, because I love my sister too much 
to see her miserable merely to make you happy !
