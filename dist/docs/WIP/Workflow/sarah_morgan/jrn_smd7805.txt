Another date in Hal's short history! I see myself 
walking home with Mr. McG just after sun 
down, meeting Miriam and Dr. Woods at the gate; 
only that was a Friday instead of a Saturday, as 
this. From the other side, Mr. Sparks comes up and 
joins us. We stand talking in the bright moonlight 
which makes Miriam look white and statue-like. I 
am holding roses in my hand, in return for which 
one little pansy has been begged from my garden, 
and is now figuring as a shirt-stud. I turn to speak 
to that man of whom I said to Dr. Woods, before I 
even knew his name, "Who is this man who passes 
here so constantly? I feel that I shall hate him to 
my dying day." He told me his name was Sparks, 
a good, harmless fellow, etc. And afterwards, when 
I did know him, [Dr. Woods] would ask every time 
we met, "Well! do you hate Sparks yet?" I could 
not really hate any one in my heart, so I always 
answered, "He is a good-natured fool, but I will 
hate him yet." But even now I cannot: my only 
feeling is intense pity for the man who has dealt 
us so severe a blow; who made my dear father bow 
his gray head, and shed such bitter tears. 
</p><p>
moon is rising still higher now, and people are hurrying to the grand Meeting, where the state 
of the country is to be discussed, and the three young 
men bow and hurry off, too. Later, at eleven o clock, 
Miriam and I are up at Lydia's waiting (until the 
boat comes) with Miss Comstock who is going away. 
As usual, I am teasing and romping by turns. 
Harry suddenly stands in the parlor door, looking 
very grave, and very quiet. He is holding father's 
stick in his hand, and says he has come to take us 
over home. I was laughing still, so I said, "Wait," 
while I prepared for some last piece of folly, but he 
smiled for the first time, and throwing his arm 
around me, said, "Come home, you rogue!" and 
laughing still, I followed him. 
</p><p>
He left us in the hall, saying he must go to Charlie's 
a moment, but to leave the door open for him. So 
we went up, and I ran in his room, and lighted his 
gas for him, as I did every night when we went up 
together. In a little while I heard him come in and 
go to his room. I knew nothing then ; but next day, 
going into mother's room, I saw him standing before 
the glass door of her armoir, looking at a black coat 
he had on. Involuntarily I cried out, "Oh, don t, 
Hal!" "Don't what? Isn't it a nice coat?" he 
asked. "Yes; but it is buttoned up to the throat, 
and I don't like to see it. It looks " here I went 
out as abruptly as I came in; that black coat so 
tightly buttoned troubled me. 
</p><p>
He came to our room after a while and said he 
was going ten miles out in the country for a few days. I begged him to stay, and reproached him for 
going away so soon after he had come home. But 
he said he must, adding, " Perhaps I am tired of you, 
and want to see something new. I'll be so glad to 
get back in a few days. Father said yes, he must go, 
so he went without any further explanation. 
</p><p>
Walking out to Mr. Davidson's that evening, 
Lydia and I sat down on a fallen rail beyond the 
Catholic graveyard, and there she told me what had 
happened. The night before, sitting on Dr. Woods's 
gallery, with six or eight others who had been sing 
ing, Hal called on Mr. Henderson to sing. He complied by singing one that was not nice. Old Mr. Sparks got up to leave, and Hal said, "I hope we 
are not disturbing you?" No, he said he was tired 
and would go home. As soon as he was gone, his 
son, who I have since heard was under the influence 
of opium, though Hal always maintained that he 
was not, said it was a shame to disturb his poor 
old father. Hal answered, "You heard what he 
said. We did not disturb him." "You are a liar!" 
the other cried. That is a name that none of our 
family has either merited or borne with; and quick 
as thought Hal sprang to his feet and struck him 
across the face with the walking-stick he held. The 
blow sent the lower part across the balcony in the 
street, as the spring was loosened by it, while the 
upper part, to which was fastened the sword for 
it was father's sword-cane remained in his hand. 
</p><p>
I doubt that he ever before knew the cane could come 
apart. Certainly he did not perceive it, until the 
other whined piteously he was taking advantage 
over an unarmed man ; when, cursing him, he (Harry) 
threw it after the body of the cane, and said, "Now 
we are equal." The other's answer was to draw a 
knife, 1 and was about to plunge it into Harry, who 
disdained to flinch, when Mr. Henderson threw 
himself on Mr. Sparks and dragged him off. 
</p><p>
It was a little while after that Harry came for us. 
The consequence of this was a challenge from Mr. Sparks in the morning, which was accepted by Harry's 
friends, who appointed Monday, at <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a>, to 
meet. Lydia did not tell me that; she said she 
thought it had been settled peaceably, so I was not 
uneasy, and only wanted Harry to come back from 
Seth David's soon. The possibility of his fighting 
never occurred to me. 
</p><p>
Sunday evening I was on the front steps with 
Miriam and Dr. Woods, talking of Harry and wishing he would come. " You want Harry!" the doctor 
repeated after me; "you had better learn to live 
without him." "What an absurdity!" I said and 
wondered when he would come. Still later, Miriam, 
father, and I were in the parlor, when there was a 
tap on the window, just above his head, and I saw 
a hand, for an instant. Father hurried out, and we 
heard several voices; and then steps going away. 
Mother came down and asked who had been there, but we only knew that, whoever it was, father had 
afterward gone with them. Mother went on: 
"There is something going on, which is to be kept 
from me. Every one seems to know it, and to make 
a secret of it." I said nothing, for I had promised 
Lydia not to tell; and even I did not know all. 
</p><p>
When father came back, Harry was with him. I 
saw by his nod, and "How are you, girls," how he 
wished us to take it, so neither moved from our 
chairs, while he sat down on the sofa and asked what 
kind of a sermon we had had. And we talked of 
anything except what we were thinking of, until we 
went upstairs. 
</p><p>
Hal afterwards told me that he had been arrested 
up there, and father went with him to give bail ; and 
that the sheriff had gone out to <a href='/results.php?city=greenwell' rel='city'>Greenwell</a> after Mr. Sparks. He told me all about it next morning, saying he was glad it was all over, but sorry for Mr. Sparks ; for he had a blow on his face which nothing 
would wash out. I said, "Hal, if you had fought, 
much as I love you, I would. rather he had killed 
you than that you should have killed him. I love 
you too much to be willing to see blood on your 
hands." First he laughed at me, then said, "If I 
had killed him, I never would have seen you again." 
</p><p>
We thought it was all over; so did he. But <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> was wild about it. Mr. Sparks was the bully 
of the town, having nothing else to do, and when 
ever he got angry or drunk, would knock down any 
body he chose. That same night, before Harry met 
him, he had slapped one man, and had dragged 
another over the room by the hair; but these coolly 
went home, and waited for a voluntary apology. So 
the mothers, sisters, and intimate friends of those 
who had patiently borne the blows, and being "woolled," vaunted the example of their heroes, 
and asked why Dr. Morgan had not acted as they 
had done, and waited for an apology? Then there 
was another faction who cried only blood could wash 
out that blow and make a gentleman of Mr. Sparks 
again, as though he ever had been one! So knots 
assembled at street corners, and discussed it, until 
father said to us that Monday night, " These people 
are so excited, and are trying so hard to make this 
affair worse, that I would not be surprised if they 
shot each other down in the street," speaking of 
Harry and the other. 
</p><p>
Hal seemed to think of it no more, though, and 
Wednesday said he must go to the city and consult 
Brother as to where he should permanently establish himself. I was sorry ; yet glad that he would then 
get away from all this trouble. I don't know that 
I ever saw him in higher spirits than he was that 
day and evening, the 24th. Lilly and Charlie were 
here until late, and he laughed and talked so incessantly that we called him crazy. We might have 
guessed by his extravagant spirits that he was 
trying to conceal something from us. ... 
</p><p>
He went away before daybreak, and I never saw him again.
