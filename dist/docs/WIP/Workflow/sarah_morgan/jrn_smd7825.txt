Last evening mother and Miriam went to the 
Arsenal to see if they would be allowed to do any 
thing for the prisoners. General Williams received 
them, and fascinated Miriam by his manner, as 
usual. Poor Miriam is always being fascinated, according to her own account. He sent for little Nathan 
Castle and Willie Garig, and left them alone in the 
room with them, showing his confidence and delicacy 
by walking away. The poor young men were very 
grateful to be remembered ; one had his eyes too full 
of tears to speak. Mr. Garig told Miriam that when 
the story of her refusing the escort was told in camp, 
the woods rang with shouts of "Three cheers for 
Miss Morgan!" They said they were treated very 
well, and had no want, except clean clothes, and to 
let their mothers know they were well and content. 
I have been hard at work mending three or four 
suits of the boys clothing for those poor young men. 
Some needed thread and needle very much, but it 
was the best we could do. So I packed them all up 
- not forgetting a row of pins and sent Tiche off 
with the bundle, perched real Congo fashion on her 
many-colored head-handkerchief, which was tied in 
the most superb Creole style in honor of the occasion.
