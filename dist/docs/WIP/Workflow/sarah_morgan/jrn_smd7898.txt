Miriam went off to <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> before daylight yesterday, with Mr. Carter and Mrs. Worley. She would 
not let me go for fear mother should keep us. At 
midnight they got back last night, tired, sleepy, and 
half-frozen, for our first touch of cool weather came 
in a strong north wind in the evening which grew 
stronger and stronger through the night, and they 
had worn only muslin dresses. I shall never cease 
to regret that I did not go too. Miriam says mother 
is looking very sad. Sad, and I am trying to forget 
all our troubles, and am so happy here! O mother, 
how selfish it was to leave you ! I ask myself whether 
it were best to stay there where we would only be 
miserable without adding anything to your comfort 
or pleasure, or to be here, careless and happy while 
you are in that horrid hole so sad and lonesome. 
According to my theory, Miriam would remind me 
that I say it is better to have three miserable persons 
than two happy ones whose happiness occasions the misery of the third. That is my doctrine only in 
peculiar cases; it cannot be applied to this one. 
I say that if, for example, Miriam and I should love 
the same person, while that person loved only me, 
rather than make her unhappy by seeing me marry 
him, I would prefer making both him and myself 
miserable, by remaining single. She says "Fudge!" 
which means, I suppose, nonsense. But our happiness here does not occasion mother's unhappiness. 
She would rather see us enjoying ourselves here than 
moping there. One proof is, that she did not suggest 
our return. She longs to get home, but cannot leave 
poor Lilly alone, for Charlie is in Granada. Oh, how 
willingly I would return to the old wreck of our home ! 
All its desolation could not be half so unendurable 
as <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>. But Lilly cannot be left. Poor Lilly! 
When I look at her sad young face, my heart bleeds 
for her. With five helpless little children to care 
for, is she not to be pitied? I think that such a 
charge, in such dreadful days, would kill me. How 
patiently she bears it!
