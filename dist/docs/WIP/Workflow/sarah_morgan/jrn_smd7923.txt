That blessed Mr. Halsey like an angel of mercy sent me "Kate Coventry" yesterday, just when I 
was pining for a <em>bonne bouche</em> of some kind, I did not care what, whether a stick of candy or an equally 
palatable book. It is delightful to have one's wishes realized as soon as they are made. I think it rather 
caused me to relent towards Mr. Halsey; I did not feel half so belligerent as I did just the Sunday 
before. At all events, I felt well enough to go down in the evening when he called again, though I had been 
too indisposed to do so on a previous occasion. (O Sarah!)

Wheeled into the parlor, there I beheld not my friend alone, but several other individuals whose presence rather startled me. I found myself undergoing 
the terrors of an introduction to a Colonel Locke, and to my unspeakable surprise, Major Buckner was 
claiming the privilege of shaking hands with me, and Colonel Steadman was on the other side, and was 
that Mr. Halsey? O never! The Mr. Halsey I knew was shockingly careless of his dress, never had his 
hair smooth ; let his beard grow as it would, and wore a most ferocious slouched hat. This one had taken 
more than one look at the glass, a thing I should have imagined the other incapable of doing. He had be 
stowed the greatest care and attention on his dress, had brought his beard within reasonable limits, had 
combed his hair with the greatest precision, and held lightly in one hand an elegant little cap that I am 
sure must be provokingly becoming. Why, he was handsome! Aha! some mistake, surely, I cried to 
myself. My Mr. Halsey was not, certainly! " If it be I, as I hope it may be, I've a little dog at home who 
will surely know me," I kept repeating. I resolved to test the little dog's sagacity, so I pretended to know 
this apparition, and thanked him for the pleasure he had afforded me by sending me "Kate Coventry." 
He looked conscious and pleased! The "little dog" had found out his identity! I was more puzzled than 
ever. How account for this wondrous change? . . . 
But metaphorphosed "John" talked! He was expatiating at a most extraordinary rate, and had been doing so for an hour after supper, when Gibbes 
drew his chair near me (Gibbes likes to hear what 
visitors say to his little sister) ; whereupon timid Mr. Halsey drew his slightly back, and very soon after 
asked for his horse. O Gibbes! you wretch! what an amusing <em>tte-a-tte</em> you spoiled, you innocent! And 
the General, of course, only waited for his exit before beginning to tease me unmercifully. I must put an 
end to this; they shall not bring such unjust charges against him. Yet how am I to make them see reason?

Night. 
</p><p>
I am more pleased to-night than I could well express. I have been talking to an old and dear friend, 
no other than Will Pinckney! His arrival was as unexpected as it was agreeable. The cry of "Here 
comes Will Pinckney" sent me back to August, '60, when the words were always the forerunner of fun 
and frolic. . . . He told me what he called his secrets ; of how he had been treated by the War Department 
(which has, indeed, behaved shockingly towards the Colonel).
