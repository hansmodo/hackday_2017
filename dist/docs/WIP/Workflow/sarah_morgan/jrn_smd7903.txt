A letter from Jimmy, the first we have received since <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> fell. It was dated the 10th inst., 
and he spoke of being on the eve of running the blockade, and going to Liverpool "to represent our 
unfortunate navy," as he says, though I am at loss to imagine what he can mean. He speaks of a kind 
friend, a Mr. George Trenholm, whose kindness has been perfectly extraordinary. He has befriended him in every way.

Charlie has just come by the railroad, bringing other letters from him, to mother and Lilly. In mother's is his last good-bye on the 12th. Again 
Mr. Trenholm is the theme. I could not help crying over my dear little brother's manly, affectionate letter. He says he is sure God will still care for him, 
He has raised him up friends wherever he has been. He says he lost all his clothing in going to Charles 
ton. There, among other kind people, he met this 
gentleman, who carried him to his house, where he 
has kept him ever since, treating him like his son, 
and forced him to accept a magnificent outfit as a 
present from him. He procured the appointment 
which sends Jimmy abroad (I wish Jimmy had been 
more explicit concerning it ; we hardly know what it 
is, or how long it will keep him). The money he 
received to pay Jimmy's passage (received from the 
Government) he in turn obliged Jimmy to accept, 
as he sails in one of Mr. Trenholm's steamers; and 
not satisfied with that, gives him carte blanche on his 
house in England, to be filled up with any amount 
he chooses to name.

Mother went back to <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> with Charlie that evening, to my great distress; for she hates that odious place as much as I. 
</p><p>
I know the life will kill her if it lasts six months longer. How happy I would be, if it were not for the 
thought of her uncomfortable position there! Lilly agrees with me that, once out of it, she never wishes 
to see the vile place again. Margret says that when the Lord had finished all the world and all the people, 
he had some scraps left, and just thought he'd "batch up" <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> with them. Perhaps she is right.
