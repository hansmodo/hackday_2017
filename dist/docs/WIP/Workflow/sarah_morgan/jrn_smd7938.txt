Early last evening the tremendous clatter of a sword that made such unnecessary noise that one 
might imagine the owner thereof had betaken himself to the favorite pastime of his childhood, and 
was prancing in on his murderous weapon, having mistaken it for his war steed, announced the arrival 
of Captain Bradford, who with two friends came to 
say adieu. Those vile Yankees have been threatening Ponchatoula, and his battery, with a regiment of 
infantry, was on its way there to drive them back. 
The Captain sent me word of the distressing departure, with many assurances that he would take care of "my" John.

Scarcely had he departed, when lo! John arrives, 
and speaks for himself. Yes! he is going! Only a 
moment to say good-bye . . . sunset approaches. 
Well ! he must say good-bye now ! Chorus of young 
ladies: "Oh, will you not spend the evening with us? 
You can easily overtake the battery later." Chorus 
of married ladies: "You must not think of going. 
Here is a comfortable room at your service, and 
after an early breakfast you can be on the road as 
soon as the others." No necessity for prayers; he 
readily consents. And yet, as the evening wore on, 
when we laughed loudest I could not help but think 
of poor little Mrs. McPhaul sitting alone and crying over her brother's departure, fancying his precious bones lying on the damp ground with only the 
soldier's roof -- the blue vault of heaven above, 
while two miles away he sat in a comfortable parlor 
amusing himself.

About sunrise, while the most delightful dreams 
floated through my brain, a little voice roused me exclaiming, "Sady! Sady! John Hawsey say so! 
Say give Sady!" I opened my eyes to see little Gibbes standing by me, trying to lay some flowers 
on my cheek, his little face sparkling with delight at his own importance. A half-opened rosebud with the 
faintest blush of pink on its creamy leaves a pink, and a piece of arbor vitae, all sprinkled with 
dew, this was my bouquet. The servant explained that Mr. Halsey had just left, and sent me that with 
his last good-bye. And he has gone! "And now there's nothing left but weeping! His face I ne er 
shall see, and naught is left to me, save" - putting away my book and all recollections of nonsense. So here goes !
