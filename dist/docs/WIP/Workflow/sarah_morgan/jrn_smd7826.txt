My poor old diary comes to a very abrupt end, to my great distress. The hardest thing in the world is 
to break off journalizing when you are once accustomed to it, and mine has proved such a resource to 
me in these dark days of trouble that I feel as though I were saying good-bye to an old and tried friend. 
Thanks to my liberal supply of pens, ink, and paper, how many inexpressibly dreary days I have filled 
up to my own satisfaction, if not to that of others! How many disagreeable affairs it has caused me to 
pass over without another thought, how many times it has proved a relief to me where my tongue was 
forced to remain quiet! Without the blessed materials, I would have fallen victim to despair and "the 
Blues" long since; but they have kept my eyes fixed on "Better days a-coming" while slightly alluding 
to present woes ; kept me from making a fool of myself many a day ; acted as lightning rod to my mental 
thunder, and have made me happy generally. For all of which I cry, " Vivent pen, ink, and paper! " and 
add with regret, "Adieu, my mental Conductor. I fear this unchained lightning will strike somewhere, in your absence!"

"I hope to die shouting, the Lord will provide!"
