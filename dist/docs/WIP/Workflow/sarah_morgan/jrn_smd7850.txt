Yes ; that must be the date, for one day and two nights have passed since I was writing here. Where 
shall I begin the story of my wanderings? I don't know that it has a beginning, it is all so hurried and confused. 
</p><p>
But it was Tuesday evening that the Federals 
were seized with a panic which threw the whole town 
in alarm. They said our troops were within eight 
miles, ten thousand in number. The report was even 
started that the advance guard was skirmishing with 
the Federals ; the shots were heard distinctly, a dozen 
people were ready to swear. The Yankees struck 
their tents, galloped with their cannon through the 
streets with the most terrific din, troops passed at 
double-quick on their way to the Garrison, every 
thing was confusion. Mr. Tunnard told us yesterday he was present when part of them reached the 
gate of the Garrison, and saw one of the officers spring 
forward, waving his sword, and heard him cry, 
"Trot, men! Gallop, I say! Damn you! run in!" 
with a perfect yell at the close ; whereupon all lookers-on raised a shout of laughter, for the man was 
frightened out of his wits. A Federal officer told him 
that their fright was really a disgrace; and if one 
thousand of our men had come in town, the whole 
thirty-five hundred would have been at their 
mercy. Even the naval officers denounce it as a most 
arrant piece of cowardice; for instead of marching 
their troops out to meet ours, they all rushed into 
the Garrison, where, if attacked, their only retreat 
would have been into the river. The gunboats were 
ordered into the middle of the stream, in front of the 
Garrison; and cooped up there, these valiant men 
awaited the assault in such trepidation that yesterday they freely said the force could be purchased for 
fifty cents, they are so ashamed of their panic. 
</p><p>
Imagine what effect this had on the inhabitants! 
Soon, an exodus took place, in the direction of the 
Asylum, and we needs must follow the General example and run, too. In haste we packed a trunk 
with our remaining clothes, what we could get 
in, and the greatest confusion prevailed for an 
hour. Beatrice had commenced to cry early in the 
evening, and redoubled her screams when she saw 
the preparations; and Louis joining in, they cried in 
concert until eight o clock, when we finally got off. 
What a din ! Lilly looked perfectly exhausted ; that 
look on her face made me heartsick. Miriam flew 
around everywhere; mother always had one more 
article to find, and the noise was dreadful, when 
white and black assembled in the hall ready at last. 
Charlie placed half of the trunks on the dray, leaving the rest for another trip; and we at last started 
off. Besides the inevitable running-bag, tied to my 
waist, on this stifling night I had my sunbonnet, veil, 
comb, toothbrush, cabas filled with dozens of small 
articles, and dagger to carry; and then my heart 
failed me when I thought of my guitar, so I caught 
it up in the case; and remembering father's heavy 
inkstand, I seized that, too, with two fans. If I was 
asked what I did with all these things, I could not 
answer. Certain it is I had every one in my hands, 
and was not very ridiculous to behold. 
</p><p>
Seventeen in number, counting white and black, 
our procession started off, each loaded in their own 
way. The soldiers did not scruple to laugh at us. 
Those who were still waiting in front of the churches 
to be removed laughed heartily, and cried, "Hello! 
Where are you going? Running? Good-bye!" 
Fortunately they could not see our faces, for it was 
very dark. One stopped us under a lamp-post and 
wanted us to go back. He said he knew we were to 
be attacked, for the Confederates were within five 
miles ; but we were as safe at home as at the Asylum. 
He was a very handsome, respectable-looking man, 
though dirty, as Yankee soldiers always are, and in 
his shirt-sleeves besides. We thanked him for his 
kindness, and went on. All stopped at the Brunots , 
to see that they were ready to fly ; but the two parties 
were so tremendous that we gladly divided, and 
Miriam and I remained with them until they could 
get ready, while our detachment went on. 
</p><p>
Wagons, carts, every vehicle imaginable, passed 
on to places of safety, loaded with valuables, while 
women and children hurried on, on foot. It took 
the Brunots as long to prepare as it did us. I had to 
drag Sophie out of her bed, where she threw herself, 
vowing she would not run ; and after an interminable 
length of time, we were at last ready and started, 
with the addition of Mrs. Loucks and her sons in our 
train. The volunteer, whose sole duty seems to be to 
watch the Brunots, met us as we got out. He stopped 
as he met the first, looked in silence until Sophie and 
I passed, and then burst out laughing. No wonder! 
What a walk it was! Nobody hesitated to laugh, 
even though they meant to run themselves, and we 
made fun of each other, too, so our walk was merry 
enough. 
</p><p>
When we reached there, the Asylum was already 
crowded at least, it would have been a crowd in 
any other place, though a mere handful in such a 
building. The whole house was illuminated, up to 
the fifth story, and we were most graciously received 
by the director, who had thrown the whole house 
open to whoever chose to come, and exerted himself 
to be accommodating. It looked like a tremendous 
hotel where every one is at home; not a servant or 
one of the deaf and dumb children was to be seen; 
we had all the lower story to ourselves. Wasn't it 
pleasant to unload, and deposit all things in a place 
of safety! It was a great relief. Then we five girls 
walked on the splendid balcony which goes around 
the house until we could no longer walk, when I 
amused myself by keeping poor Sophie standing, 
since she would not sit down like a Christian, but 
insisted on going to bed like a lazy girl, as she is. 
When I finally let her go, it did not take her many 
minutes to undress, and soon we Were all ready for 
bed. The Brunots had beds on the parlor floor; across 
the wide hall, we had a room opposite; and next to 
ours, Lilly and the children were all sleeping soundly. 
I ran the blockade of the hall in my nightgown, and 
had a splendid romp with the girls after rolling Sophie out of bed, and jerking Nettie up. Mother 
and Mrs. Brunot cried, "Order," laughing, but they 
came in for their share of the sport, until an admiring 
crowd of females at the door told us by their amused 
faces they were enjoying it, too; so I ran the gaunt 
let again, and got safely through the hall, and after 
a few more inroads, in one of which Miriam accompanied me, and on which occasion I am sure we were 
seen in our nightgowns, we finally went to bed. I 
won't say went to sleep, for I did not pretend to doze. 
All our side of the house had bars, except me ; and the 
mosquitoes were unendurable ; so I watched mother 
and Miriam in their downy slumbers and lay on my 
hard bed for hours, fighting the torments with bare 
arms. 
</p><p>
Every now and then I heard a stir among the females above, indicating that some few were anticipating a panic. Once they took a rush from the fourth 
story, and cried they heard the cannon ; twenty guns had been fired, etc. I lay still, determined not to 
believe it; and presently all subsided. I lay there for hours longer, it seemed, when Nettie at last wandered 
in disconsolate to find if we were asleep; for with the exception of Sophie, they, too, had been awake all 
night. I went to the parlor with her, when she, Dena, and I, decided to dress at once and sit on the 
balcony, since sleep was hopeless. Behold me in a blue muslin flounced to the waist, with a cape, too! 
What a running costume! Miriam only had time to take off her white dress before starting. All dressed, 
we went to the northwest corner, as far as possible from the rest of the household, and sat in a splendid 
breeze for hours. It was better than fighting insatiable mosquitoes ; so there we sat talking through 
the greater part of a night which seemed to have borrowed a few additional hours for our benefit. 
We ll have no Leap Year in 64; the twenty-four extra hours were crowded in on that occasion, I think. 
</p><p>
We discussed our favorite books, characters, authors, repeated scraps here and there of the mock 
sentimental, talked of how we would one day like to 
travel, and where we would go; discussed love and 
marriage, and came to the conclusion neither was 
the jest it was thought to be. (O wise young women !) 
Poor Nettie retired in despair, and we two watched 
alone for hours longer. The sun must have been arrested by some Joshua on the road ; couldn't make me 
believe it was doing its duty as usual. We wandered 
around the balconies, through the grounds in the 
dim starlight (for it was cloudy), and finally, be 
holding a faint promise of morning, sat still and 
waited for the coming of the lazy sun. What was 
still more aggravating was that every time we looked 
in at the others showed them sleeping peacefully. 
Miriam lay her full length with outstretched arms, 
the picture of repose, looking so comfortable ! When 
the sun finally made his appearance (he was out on a 
spree, I found, for his eyes were not half opened, 
and he looked dull and heavy as he peeped from be 
hind his bed curtains), others began to stir, and in 
an hour more, we were ready to leave. Those who 
had slept, came out with swelled eyes and drowsy 
looks; while we three, who had been up all night, 
were perfectly calm, though rather pale; but I am 
seldom otherwise. 
</p><p>
Were we not thankful to see home still standing ! 
I did not feel tired much, but somehow, when it 
struck half-past six, and I found myself alone here 
(Miriam having stopped at Mrs. Day s), I suddenly 
found myself divested of my flounces, and most other 
articles, and involuntarily going towards the bed. I 
could not sleep, wasn't thinking of such a thing; 
meant to there was an end of my soliloquy ! 
Where I went, I don't know. As the clock struck 
eight, I got up as unaccountably, and discovered I 
had lost all idea of time in sleep. If it had not been 
for the clock, I should have said I had slept a day 
and a night, and it was now Thursday morning. A 
giant refreshed, I rose from my slumbers, took a hasty 
cup of coffee, and set to work packing Lilly's trunk, for 
I was crazy to see the children off as soon as possible. 
It was no short work, but we all hurried, said good 
bye, and saw them go with a feeling of relief. By 
the experience of the night before, we knew that 
when the real moment came it would be impossible 
to get them off in time to escape danger. Poor Lilly ! 
we miss her sadly; but are thankful to know that she 
is out of danger with her poor little children. She 
looked heartbroken at the idea of leaving us alone; 
but then, when one weak woman has five small 
babies to take care of, is it fair to impose three big 
ones on her? I d never stay here, if she sacrificed 
her children to take care of us who need no protection. 
I was very lazy after they left ; and sat reading until 
a note was brought from Charlie saying they were 
safe beyond the lines. 
Last night came another alarm. Some fifty can 
non were fired somewhere above, reports came that 
a body of our troops were a few miles out, so a thou 
sand of these men took courage and went out to 
reconnoitre. Mrs. Brunot and mother insisted on 
going again to the Asylum for protection against 
the coming attack, though we at first begged and 
pleaded to stay at home. But we had to follow, and 
I don't think any of us were in the best of humors, 
as we were all conscious of doing a foolish thing. 
</p><p>
We were cordially received again, and got quite 
gay. Sleeping accommodations no better than be 
fore, as far as I was concerned. Sophie, Miriam, and 
I had but one bar between us, so we placed two 
mattresses side by side, and by dint of chairs and 
strings, stretched the net as far as possible over 
them. Those two were well enough ; but to my share 
fell a baby's mattress two feet by four, placed between the wall and the other great bed, with the end 
of the bar a foot above my face, and one sheet to 
do the duty of two however, they had only one, 
also. Well! I believe I am tall, so my bed did not 
fit me. As it was two inches higher than theirs, there 
was no sharing. In spite of a heavy rain that was 
now pouring, my warm place was intolerable, and 
the perspiration streamed from my face so as to be 
disagreeable, to say the least. It drove me to walk 
in my sleep, I am afraid, for I have an indistinct 
recollection of finding myself standing at the window 
trying to breathe. It was a very, very little piece of sleep I got after all, and that little by no means refreshing. 
</p><p>
Up at sunrise again, but it took some time to get 
ready, for I had to get some clothes out of the trunk, 
to send home. Well, ever since I reached here I have 
been writing, and I am ashamed to say how long it is. 
As the time grows more exciting, my book grows 
shorter, to my great distress. What will I do? 
</p><p>
We all vowed that would be the last time we would 
run until we heard the cannon, or had some better 
reason than a Yankee panic to believe the Confederates were coming ; though if we listened to mother, 
she would go there every night if this lasted for a 
whole year. Kind Phillie Nolan wrote insisting on 
our staying with them on the plantation until it 
was over, but we cannot do it ; the time is too uncertain; if we knew it was to come this week, we might 
stay that long with her; but to go for an indefinite 
period, Miriam and I would not hear of. 
</p><p>
I have kept for the last a piece of news I received 
with thankfulness, when I finally heard it ; for, though 
known to the whole family and all the town on 
Tuesday night, no one thought it worth while to 
tell me until I heard it by accident last evening. It 
was that a Mr. Bell, writing to his wife, says Gibbes 
asked him to send word to mother that he, George, 
and Jimmy were in the fight of the 10th and nth, and all safe. God be praised !
