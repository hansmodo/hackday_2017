When I paused on Thursday to rest a few moments, how little idea I had that the rest I was taking would soon be required for another journey ! 
</p><p>
It was agreed among us, with our fellow travelers, Mrs. Bull and Mrs. Ivy, whom we met at Mrs. Greyson's, endeavoring to reach the city like our 
selves, that we would wait there until we could receive our passports from General Pemberton. When 
this journey was first seriously contemplated, Miriam 
wrote to Colonel Szymanski representing mother's 
state of health and my unfortunate condition, the 
necessity of medical advice for both, and the impossibility of remaining in famishing <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, and asked 
him to apply to the General for a pass to go to 
Brother. The Colonel sent word through Eugene La Noue that we should obtain it in a few days, and 
advised us to go by way of Ponchatoula. Tired of delay, and hearing that we could pass as readily on 
General Gardiner's order, we obtained one and started off without waiting for the other. The first 
news on arriving at <a href='/results.php?city=madisonville' rel='city'>Madisonville</a> was that no one 
should pass except on General Pemberton's order. Pleasant intelligence for those who had come that 
far without! The other two ladies were in the same dilemma. They were told that they should have a pass if they would wait. Waiting at the expense of 
four dollars a day for each, Mrs. Ivy with two very sick babies, Mrs. Bull with all her property in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> at stake, Tiche with her broken foot, 
mother with a powerless hand, and I with an injured spine, was anything but agreeable under the circumstances ; though nothing could be more pleasant, 
apart from this sense of restriction, than our stay at 
<a href='/results.php?city=madisonville' rel='city'>Madisonville</a>. General Pemberton took his leisure 
about the affair, which is not surprising, as our Generals have more weighty matters than women's pass 
ports to attend to. Still, pleased as we were with our residence there, it was necessary to get on as soon as 
possible. So as I rested from labors about one o'clock on Thursday, Mrs. Bull came in to suggest a new plan to mother. It was to leave immediately for a 
plantation called <a href='/results.php?city=madisonville' rel='city'>Bonfouca</a>, thirty miles off, where schooners came twice a week, and where we would be allowed to embark without a pass. Carriages that 
had just brought a party of ladies from Mandeville were waiting on the other side of the river, which could take us off immediately, for there was not a moment to lose. 
</p><p>
Instantly we resolved to hazard the undertaking. 
</p><p>
About three we got into the large scow to cross the Tchefuncta, in a party numbering five ladies, four 
children, and four servants. One of the devoted pickets, after setting me carefully in the most comfortable place, asked permission to accompany me 
as far as the carriage ; he was sure he could assist me more carefully than the drivers. And without further 
parley, he followed. Before we turned the point, Mr. Worthington l . . . the dim distance, rowing up the 
stream in the direction of <a href='/results.php?city=madisonville' rel='city'>Madisonville</a>. What if he 
had perceived us, and was hastening after us, deeming it his duty to arrest us for trying to get away with 
out General Pemberton's order? As the idea was suggested, there was rather a nervous set of ladies on 
board. The half-mile that we had to go before reaching our landing-place was passed over in nervous 
apprehension. At last the spot was reached. Mr. Worthington had not appeared, and we reached terra firma without being nabbed," as we confidently 
expected. The obliging picket put me into the carriage, bade me a most friendly adieu, and returned 
to the village, leaving us with every prospect of getting off without serious difficulty, in spite of our serious apprehensions. 
</p><p>
With two little children and Tiche with me, our carriage started off some time before the others. Two 
or three miles from our starting-point, I perceived three gentlemen riding towards us, one of whom I 
instantly recognized as Dr. Capdevielle. Instantly I stopped the carriage to speak to him. His look of 
astonishment when satisfied of my identity rather amused me; but my amusement was changed to a slight feeling of disappointment when he commenced 
talking. Was it possible I was leaving Madison? Oh, how distressed he was! He was promising him 
self so much pleasure ! And to leave so unexpectedly ! He had just come with his friends from some 
where. They had planned a surprise party at Mrs. Greyson's for us that evening, and had been after the supper they had procured somewhere, as I 
before observed, and were just now returning. And now we were deserting them ! He had invited Monsieur Berger, Monsieur Pollock, Monsieur -
<em>Mais enfin des Messieurs!</em> he exclaimed with a comical emphasis and smile that brought vivid recollections of the other party before my eyes, by force of 
contrast, I suppose. And wasn't I sorry we had left! We fairly condoled with each other. Twenty minutes had elapsed before I had so far recovered from 
the disappointment as to bethink myself of the propriety of continuing my journey. And then with the 
assurance of being mutually <em>desole</em>, we parted with a hearty good-bye, and he rode on to rejoin his companions, while I went the way he had come. 
</p><p>
Two miles beyond, I met three others of the six 
gentlemen he had mentioned, riding in a little dog 
cart which contained champagne baskets in which 
the supper was evidently packed, each gentleman 
elegantly dressed, holding between them a little 
basket of bouquets that my prophetic soul told me 
was intended for Miriam and me. I was not personally acquainted with the gentlemen, or I should 
have told them of the disappointment that awaited 
them. It must have been a disappointment! 
</p><p>
In the midst of profound reflections about fate, vanity of human wishes and calculations, friendships 
formed on the roadside in the journey through life 
(or from <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>), I raised my eyes to behold Lake Ponchartrain, and to find myself in Mandeville, just 
seven miles from the Tchefuncta. Looking at the dreary expanse of water, which suggested loneliness 
and desolation, first recalled my own situation to me. Here I was in this straggling place, with Tiche, a 
cripple like myself, and two little children under my care, without an idea of where we were to go. 
Any one as timid and dependent as I to be placed in such a position as pioneer to such a tremendous 
company would feel rather forlorn. But some step had to be taken, so I consulted the driver as to where 
we could obtain board, and followed his suggestion. One house after the other we stopped at, and with 
my veil down and my heart beating as though I were 
soliciting charity, or some other unpleasant favor, I 
tried to engage rooms for the company, without success. At last we were directed to a Frenchman, who, 
after the usual assurance of "nothing to eat" (which 
we afterwards found to be only too true), consented 
to receive us. "Taking possession" seemed to me 
such a dreadful responsibility that for some time I 
remained in the carriage, afraid to get out before the 
others arrived. But there was still no sign of them; 
so I gathered my children and Tiche, and prepared to 
dismount with the Frenchman's assistance. 
</p><p>
I have read descriptions of such houses and people, 
but I have not often seen them. The man and his 
wife were perfect specimens of the low Canadian, 
	speaking only French. No sooner had they discovered that I was "<em>blessee</em>," as they supposed, than 
each seized an arm and with overwhelming exclamations of sympathy, halfway dragged me into the 
room, where they thrust me into a chair. Their 
family seemed to consist only of cats and dogs who 
seemed to agree most harmoniously, and each of 
whom conceived the liveliest affection for us. As we 
were leaving Mrs. Greyson's, a stranger just from the 
city, brought to our room a paper of ham, tongue, and 
biscuits for "the sick young lady" (Heaven only 
knows how she heard of her), saying she had just 
traveled the road herself, and knew I would find 
nothing to eat; so she would insist on putting this in 
our basket. It was done in a manner that put all 
refusal out of the question; so it had to be accepted. 
I was feeding little Jenny Ivy and Minna Bull on 
this lunch for want of something else to do, when the 
affection of the cats and dogs became overpowering. 
Six of them jumped at us, licked Jenny's face, eat Minna's ham, and what with sundry kicks and slaps 
I had exercise enough to last a week, and was rapidly 
losing all my strength, when the woman came to my 
rescue and called her pets off just as the rest of the 
party drove up to find me almost exhausted. 
Such a bedroom ! There was a narrow single bed in 
which mother, Jenny, and I slept, a decrepit table on 
which stood a diseased mirror, a broken lounge with 
out a bottom, and a pine armoir filled with corn ! In 
the centre stood the chief ornament, a huge pile of dirt, 
near which Miriam's mattress was placed, while the 
sail of a boat flanked it in on the other side, arranged 
as a bed for Tiche. The accommodations in the 
other bedroom were far inferior to ours. Then the 
mosquitoes swarmed like pandemonium on a spree, 
and there was but one bar in the house, which the 
man declared should be only for me. I would rather 
have been devoured by the insects than enjoy comforts denied to the others ; so I made up my mind it 
should be the last time. 
</p><p>
Our supper was rare. "Nothing like it was ever seen in Paris," as <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan</a> would say. It consisted 
of one egg apiece, with a small spoonful of rice. A feast, you see! Price, one dollar each, besides the 
dollar paid for the privilege of sleeping among dirt, dogs, and fleas.
