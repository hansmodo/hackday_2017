<em>On dit</em> the Yankees have gone back to <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, hearing we had sixty thousand men coming 
down after them. I believe I am positively disappointed! I did want to see them soundly thrashed! 
The light we thought was another burning house was that of the Mississippi. They say the shrieks of 
the men when our hot shells fell among them, and after they were left by their companions to burn, were perfectly appalling.

Another letter from Lilly has distressed me beyond measure. She says the one chicken and two dozen 
eggs Miriam and I succeeded in buying from the negroes by prayers and entreaties, saved them from 
actual hunger ; and for two days they had been living on one egg apiece and some cornbread and syrup. 
Great heavens! has it come to this? Nothing to be bought in that abominable place for love or money. Where the next meal comes from, nobody knows.
