Yesterday, two Colonels, Shields and Breaux, both of whom distinguished themselves in the battle 
of <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, dined here. Their personal appearance was by no means calculated to fill me with awe, 
or even to give one an idea of their rank; for their dress consisted of merely cottonade pants, flannel 
shirts, and extremely short jackets (which, however, is rapidly becoming the uniform of the Confederate States).

Just three lines back, three soldiers came in to ask for molasses. I was alone downstairs, and the nervous trepidation with which I received the dirty, 
coarsely clad strangers, who, however, looked as though they might be gentlemen, has raised a laugh 
against me from the others who looked down from a place of safety. I don't know what I did that was 
out of the way. I felt odd receiving them as though 
it was my home, and having to answer their questions about buying, by means of acting as telegraph 
between them and Mrs. Carter. I confess to that. But I know I talked reasonably about the other 
subjects. Playing hostess in a strange house! Of 
course, it was uncomfortable! and to add to my embarrassment, the handsomest one offered to pay 
for the milk he had just drunk! Fancy my feelings, as I hastened to assure him that General Carter 
never received money for such things, and from a soldier, besides, it was not to be thought of! He 
turned to the other, saying, " In Mississippi we don't meet with such people! Miss, they don't hesitate 
to charge four bits a canteen for milk. They take all they can. They are not like you Louisianians." I 
was surprised to hear him say it of his own State, but told him we thought here we could not do enough for them.
