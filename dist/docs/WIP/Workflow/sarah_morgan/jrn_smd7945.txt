Mr. Halsey brought us each a little tortoise-shellring he had made for us by his camp-fire, as a keep 
sake, and of course we promised to wear them for 
him, particularly as they make our hands look as 
white as possible. Towards sunset, in spite of prayers 
and entreaties from Miriam, who insisted that I was 
too feeble to attempt it, I insisted on walking out to 
the bench by the river to enjoy the cool breeze ; and 
was rather glad I had come, when soon after Dr. Capdevielle made his appearance, with two beautiful bouquets which he presented with his French 
bow to us; and introducing his friend, Mr. Miltonberger, entered into one of those lively discussions 
about nothing which Frenchmen know how to make so interesting. . . .

No sooner had they left than, to our infinite surprise, the immortal seven of Saturday night walked 
in. Wonder what fun they find in coming? I see 
none. For we rarely trouble ourselves about their 
presence; there are but two I have addressed as yet; 
one because I am forced to say yes or no to his remarks, and the other because I like his banjo, which 
he brought again, and feel obliged to talk occasion 
ally since he is so accommodating, and affords me the 
greatest amusement with his comic songs. I was 
about re tiring unceremoniously about twelve o clock, 
completely worn out, when they finally bethought 
themselves of saying good-night, and saved me the 
necessity of being rude. Wonder if that is all the fun 
they have? I should say it was rather dry. It is 
mean to laugh at them, though ; their obliging dispositions should save them from our ridicule. Last 
evening Mr. Halsey succeeded in procuring a large 
skiff, whereupon four or five of them offered to row, 
and took us way down the Tchefuncta through the 
most charming scenery to a spot where Echo answered us in the most remarkable way ; her distinct 
utterance was really charming. Not being aware of 
the secret, I thought the first answer to the halloo 
was from pickets. Mr. Halsey has a magnificent 
voice ; and the echoes came back so full and rich that 
soon we appointed him speaker by mutual consent, 
and were more than repaid by the delightful sounds 
that came from the woods. The last ray of the sun 
on the smooth waters; the soldiers resting on their 
oars while we tuned the guitar and sang in the still 
evening, until twilight, slowly closing over, warned 
us to return, forms another of those pictures indescribable though never to be forgotten.
