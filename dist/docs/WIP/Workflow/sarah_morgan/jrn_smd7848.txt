It is impossible to discover the true story of last 
night's alarm. Some say it was a gang of negroes who 
attacked the pickets in revenge for having been 
turned out of the Garrison ; others say it was a number 
of our soldiers who fired from the bushes ; and the most 
amusing story is that they took alarm at an old white 
horse, which they killed, mistaking him for the confederates. One regiment has refused to do picket 
duty; and the story runs among these poor soldiers 
that our army, which is within a mile, is perfectly 
overwhelming. The excitement still continues.

I have been writing to the Brunots the news confirming the death of <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan</a>, the surrender of his 
army, and the good tidings of our Ram's recent exploits above <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>, and her arriving safely 
under the guns there. If we could keep all the dispatches that have passed between us since the battle 
of the forts, what a collection of absurdity and contradiction it would be! "Forts have been taken." 
"Their ships have passed; forts safe; Yankees at our 
mercy." " Ships at <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>. City to be bombarded in twelve hours. " l Forts surrendered. City 
under British protection." "No, it is n t." "City surrendered." "Mistake." "<a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> to be 
burned when Yankee ships come." And soon, some times three times a day, each dispatch contradicting 
the other, and all equally ridiculous.

The crowd here seems to increase. The streets are thronged with the military, and it will soon be impossible to go even to Mrs. Brunot's, which will be 
a great privation to me. . . . Five thousand are to come next week, and then it will really be impossible to go in the streets.
