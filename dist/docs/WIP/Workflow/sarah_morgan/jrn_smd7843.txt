Brother writes that rumors of the capture of <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> by our troops have made him very uneasy 
about us; and he wishes us to go down to <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> if possible. I wish we could. The impression 
here, is that an attack is inevitable, and the city papers found it necessary to contradict the rumor 
of Ruggles having occupied it already. I wish mother would go. I can see no difference there or here, 
except that there, we will be safe, for a while at least. . . .

I grow desperate when I read these Northern papers reviling and abusing us, reproaching us for 
being broken and dispersed, taunting us with their victories, sparing no humiliating name in speaking of 
us, and laughing as to what " we ll see" when we vile rebels are " driven out of Virginia, and the glorious 
Union firmly established." I can't bear these taunts! I grow sick to read these vile, insulting papers that 
seem written expressly to goad us into madness ! . . . There must be many humane, reasonable men in 
the North ; can they not teach their editors decency in this their hour of triumph?
