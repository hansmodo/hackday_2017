From the news brought by one or two persons who 
managed to reach here yesterday, I am more uneasy 
about mother and the girls. A gentleman tells me 
that no one is permitted to leave without a pass, 
and of these, only such as are separated from their 
families, who may have left before. All families are 
prohibited to leave, and furniture and other valuables also. Here is an agreeable arrangement! I 
saw the "pass," just such as we give our negroes, 
signed by a Wisconsin colonel. Think of being obliged 
to ask permission from some low plowman to go in or 
out of our own house! Cannon are planted as far 
out as Colonel Davidson's, six of them at our grave 
yard, and one or more on all the other roads. If the 
guerrillas do not attempt their capture, I shall take 
it upon myself to suggest it to the very next one I 
see. Even if they cannot use them, it will frighten 
the Yankees, who are in a state of constant alarm 
about them. Their reason for keeping people in 
town is that they hope they will not be attacked so 
long as our own friends remain ; thereby placing us 
above themselves in the scale of humanity, since 
they acknowledge we are not brute enough to kill 
women and children as they did not hesitate to do.

Farragut pleads that he could not restrain his 
men, they were so enraged when the order was once 
given to fire, and says they would strike a few houses, 
though he ordered them to fire solely at horses, and 
the clouds of dust in the street, where guerrillas were 
supposed to be. The dust was by no means thick 
enough to conceal that these "guerrillas" were 
women, carrying babies instead of guns, and the 
horses were drawing buggies in which many a sick 
woman was lying.

A young lady who applied to the Yankee General for a pass to come out here, having doubtless spoken 
of the number of women here who had fled, and the 
position of the place, was advised to remain in town 
and write to the ladies to return immediately, and 
assure them that they would be respected and protected, etc., but that it was madness to remain at 
Green well, for a terrific battle would be fought there 
in a few days, and they would be exposed to the 
greatest danger. The girl wrote the letter, but, Mr. Fox, we are not quite such fools as to return there 
to afford you the protection our petticoats would 
secure to you, thereby preventing you from receiving condign punishment for the injuries and loss of 
property already inflicted upon us by you. No! we 
remain here; and if you are not laid low before you 
pass the Comite Bridge, we can take to the woods 
again, and camp out, as many a poor woman is doing 
now, a few miles from town. Many citizens have 
been arrested, and after being confined a while, and 
closely questioned, have been released, if the in 
formation is satisfactory. A negro man is informing 
on all cotton burners and violent Secessionists, etc.

Sunday night.

The girls have just got back, riding in a mule team, on top of baggage, but without either mother 
or any of our affairs. Our condition is perfectly desperate. Miriam had an interview with General Williams, which was by no means satisfactory. He 
gave her a pass to leave, and bring us back, for he says there is no safety here for us ; he will restrain his 
men in town, and protect the women, but once out side, he will answer neither for his men, nor the 
women and children. As soon as he gets horses enough, he passes this road, going to Camp Moore with his cavalry, and then we are in greater danger 
than ever. Any house shut up shall be occupied by 
soldiers. Five thousand are there now, five more expected. What shall we do? Mother remained, sending Miriam for me, determined to keep us there, 
rather than sacrifice both our lives and property by remaining here. But then two weeks from now 
the yellow fever will break out; mother has the greatest horror of it, and we have never had it ; dying 
is not much in the present state of our affairs, but the survivor will suffer even more than we do now. If 
we stay, how shall we live? I have seventeen hundred dollars in Confederate notes now in my "running-bag," and three or four in silver. The former 
will not be received there, the latter might last two days. If we save our house and furniture, it is at the 
price of starving. I am of opinion that we should send for mother, and with what money we have, make 
our way somewhere in the interior, to some city where we can communicate with the boys, and be 
advised by them. This is not living. Home is lost beyond all hope of recovery; if we wait, what we 
have already saved will go, too; so we had better leave at once, with what clothing we have, which 
will certainly establish us on the footing of ladies, if we chance to fall among vulgar people who never 
look beyond. I fear the guerrillas will attack the town to-night; if they do, God help mother!

General Williams offered Miriam an escort when he found she was without a protector, in the most 
fatherly way; he must be a good man. She thanked him, but said "she felt perfectly safe on that road." 
He bit his lip, understanding the allusion, and did not insist. She was to deliver a message from parties in 
town to the first guerrillas they met, concerning the 
safest roads, and presently six met them, and entered into conversation. She told them of the proffered escort, when one sprang forward crying, "Why 
didn't you accept, Miss? The next time, ask for one, and if it is at all disagreeable to you, / am the 
very man to rid you of such an inconvenience ! I'll see that you are not annoyed long." I am glad it was 
not sent ; she would have reproached herself with murder forever after. I wonder if the General would have risked it?
