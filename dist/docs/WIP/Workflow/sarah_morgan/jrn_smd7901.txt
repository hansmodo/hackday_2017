What an unexpected change! I am surprised myself! Yesterday as the <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> party were about leaving, Miriam thought Lilly would be lonesome alone here with her sick baby, and decided 
that we should leave by the cars, and stay with her until mother returned. There was no time to lose; 
so dressing in haste, we persuaded Anna to accompany us, and in a few moments stood ready. We walked down to the overseer's house to wait for the 
cars, and passed the time most agreeably in eating sugar-cane, having brought a little negro expressly 
to cut it for us and carry our carpet-bag. Three young ladies, who expected to be gone from Saturday until Wednesday, having but one carpet-bag 
between them! Can it be credited? But, then, we knew we had clothes here, and depended upon them for supplies, when we now find they are in the trunk 
and mother has the key. We walked aboard alone, in the crowded train, and found ourselves in the only car reserved for 
ladies, which was already filled with a large party 
returning from Port Hudson, consisting of the fastest set of girls that I have seen for some time. Anna 
and I had to content ourselves with a seat on a small 
box between the benches, while Miriam was established on the only vacant one, with a sick soldier 
lying at her feet. The fast girls talked as loud as 
possible and laughed in a corresponding style in 
spite of the sick man. They must have been on a 
picnic, from the way they talked. One in a short 
dress complained that she had not seen her sweet 
heart. A pert little miss of thirteen cried, "You can 
bet your head I never went to any place where I did 
not see one of my sweethearts." One of about 
seventeen, a perfect beauty, declared she would 
die of thirst. "So will I! and I don't want to die 
before I get a husband!" exclaimed her vis-^-vis. 
They evidently expected to produce an impression 
on us. At every "brilliant" remark ("stupid" 
understood), they looked at us to see what we 
thought. All of them sat with bare heads in the 
strong light, an unfailing proof of la basse classe on 
steamers and cars. Every time my veil blew aside, 
they made no difficulty about scanning my features 
as though they thought it might be agreeable. I 
must confess I was equally impolite in regard to 
the Beauty; but then her loveliness was an excuse, 
and my veil sheltered me, besides. While this young 
Psyche was fascinating me, with her perfect face and 
innocent expression, one of her companions made a 
remark one that I dare say is made every day, 
and that I never imagined could be turned into 
harm. My Beauty uttered a prolonged "Oh!" of 
horror, and burst out laughing, followed by all the 
others. My disgust was unspeakable. Mock modesty is always evident. A modest girl could not have 
noticed the "catch"; the immodest, on the lookout 
for such an opportunity, was the only one who could 
have perceived it. Well! after all, no one can be 
perfect; this may be the single stain on my Beauty, 
though I confess I would rather have any other failing than this, almost.

Putting this aside, I hardly know which I was 
most amused by: the giddy, lively girls to my right, 
or the two ladies to my left who were as cross and 
ill-natured as two old cats and railed unmercifully 
at the silly creatures behind them, and carried their 
spite so far as to refuse to drink because the conductor (the husband of one of them) gave the young 
ladies water before passing it to their two elders. 
Didn't the poor man get it! She wouldn't taste 
a drop of that nasty dirty drippings, that she 
would n t! Might have had the decency to attend 
to his kinsfolks, before them creatures! And why 
didn't he wait on those two young ladies behind 
her? He did ask them? Well, ask them again! 
they must want some! Poor Henpecked meekly 
passed the can again, to be again civilly declined. 
I confess the "drippings" were too much for me 
also, though I did not give it as my excuse. Mrs. Hen recommenced her pecking; poor Mr. Hen at 
last surlily rejoined, "For Heaven's sake, don't 
make a fuss in the cars," with an emphasis on the 
last word that showed he was accustomed to it at 
home, at least. With my veil down, I leaned against 
the window, and remembering Colonel Breaux's 
remarks two nights before concerning cross people, 
I played his "little philosopher" for the remainder 
of the journey.

At sunset we walked in at Lilly's gate, and astonished her by standing before her as she sat alone 
with her poor sick little Beatrice in her arms. . . .
