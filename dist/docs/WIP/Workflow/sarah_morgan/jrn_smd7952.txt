The excitement about Port Hudson and <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a> is intense. When I heard on Friday that the 
last attack was being made on the former place, I 
took to my prayers with a delirium of fervor. If I was 
a man, if I had the blessed privilege of fighting, I would 
be on the breastworks, or perchance on the water 
batteries under Colonel Steadman's command. But 
as I was unfortunately born a woman, I stay home 
and pray with heart and soul. That is all I can do; 
but I do it with a will. In my excitement, I was wishing that I was a Catholic, that I might make a vow 
for the preservation of Port Hudson, when a brilliant 
idea struck me. It was this: though vows are peculiar to Catholics, mosquitoes are common to all 
sects. From that arose this heroic scheme: I said, 
"Hear me, Miriam, thou who knowest I have slept 
undisturbed but three nights out of seventeen, four 
hours out of each of the other fourteen having been 
spent in destroying my insatiable foe. Thou seest that nightly vigils are torturing me pale and weak, 
thou knowest what unspeakable affection I have for 
the youth yclept by the ancients Morpheus. Yet 
listen to my vow: If Port Hudson holds out, if our 
dear people are victorious, I offer up myself on the 
altar of my country to mosquitoes, and never again 
will I murmur at their depredations and voracity." 
Talk of pilgrimages, and the ordinary vow of wearing 
only the Virgin's colors (the most becoming in the 
world) ; there never was one of greater heroism or more 
sublime self-sacrifice than this. And as if to prove my 
sincerity, they have been worse than ever these last 
two nights. But as yet I have not murmured; for 
the Yankees, who swore to enter Port Hudson before 
last Monday night, have not yet fulfilled their promise, and we hold it still. <em>Vivent</em> vows and mosquitoes, 
and forever may our flag wave over the entrenchments! We will conquer yet, with God's blessing!

A week or ten days ago came a letter from Lydia, 
who is placed within the lines by this recent raid. 
She writes that the sugar-house and quarters have 
been seized for Yankee hospitals, that they have 
been robbed of their clothing, and that they are in 
pursuit of the General, who I pray Heaven may 
escape them. She wrote for clothing, provisions, and 
a servant, and after we had procured them all, and 
were ready to send them, we discovered that they 
would not be allowed to pass ; so I hardly know what 
the poor child will do unless she accepts Brother's 
invitation to come down to him immediately, if she thinks it right.
