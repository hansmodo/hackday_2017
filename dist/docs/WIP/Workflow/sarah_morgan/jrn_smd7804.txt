And another was silly little Mr. B r, my little golden calf . What a don't call names! I owe him 
a grudge for "cold hands," and the other day, when 
I heard of his being wounded at Shiloh, I could not help laughing a little at Tom B r's being hurt. 
</p><p>
What was the use of throwing a nice, big cannon 
ball, that might have knocked a man down, away 
on that poor little fellow, when a pea from a popgun 
would have made the same impression? Not but what he is brave, but little Mr. B r is so soft. 
Then there was that rattle-brain Mr. T 1 who, commencing one subject, never ceased speaking until 
he had touched on all. One evening he came in 
talking, and never paused even for a reply until he 
bowed himself out, talking still, when Mr. Bradford, 
who had been forced to silence as well as the rest, 
threw himself back with a sigh of relief and exclaimed, "This man talks like a woman ! " I thought it the best description of Mr. T t's conversation 
</p><p>
I had ever heard. It was all on the surface, no pre 
tensions to anything except to put the greatest possible number of words of no meaning in one sentence, 
while speaking of the most trivial thing. Night or 
day, Mr. T. never passed home without crying 
out to me, " Ces jolis yeux bleus!" and if the parlor 
were brightly lighted so that all from the street 
might see us, and be invisible to us themselves, I 
always nodded my head to the outer darkness and 
laughed, no matter who was present, though it 
sometimes created remark. You see, I knew the joke. Coming from a party escorted by Mr. B r, 
we had to wait a long time 
before Rose opened the door, which interval I employed in dancing up and down the gallery followed by my cavalier singing, 
</p><p>
"Mes jolis yeux bleus, 
Bleus comme les cieux, 
Mes jolis yeux bleus 
Ont ravi son &me," etc.; 
</p><p>
which naive remark Mr. B r, not speaking French, lost entirely, and Mr. T endorsed it 
with his approbation and belief in it, and ever afterwards called me " Ces jolis yeux bleus."
