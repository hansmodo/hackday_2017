It may be wrong; I feel very contrite; but still I 
cannot help thinking it is an error on the right side. 
It began by Miriam sending Mr. Conn a box of 
cigars when she was on Canal the other day, with a 
note saying we would be delighted to assist him in 
anyway. Poor creature!  He wrote an answer which 
breathed desolation and humility, under his present 
situation, in every line. The cigars, an unexpected 
kindness, had touched a tender cord evidently. He 
said he had no friends, and would be grateful for our 
assistance. 
</p><p>
But before his answer arrived, yesterday morning 
I took it into my head that Colonel Steadman was 
also at the Custom-House, though his arrival had not 
been announced, the Yankees declining to publish 
any more names to avoid the excitement that follows. So Miriam and I prepared a lunch of chicken, 
soup, wine, preserves, sardines, and cakes, to send 
to him. And, fool-like, I sent a note with it. It only 
contained the same offer of assistance; and I would 
not object to the town crier's reading it; but it upset 
Brother's ideas of decorum completely. He said 
nothing to Miriam's, because that was first offense; 
but yesterday he met Edmond, who was carrying 
the basket, and he could not stand the sight of 
another note. I wish he had read it! But he said he 
would not assume such a right. So he came home 
very much annoyed, and spoke to Miriam about it. 
Fortunately for my peace of mind, I was swimming 
in the bathtub in blissful unconsciousness, else I 
should have drowned myself. He said, " I want you 
both to understand that you shall have everything 
you want for the prisoners. Subscribe any sum of 
money, purchase any quantity of clothing, send all 
the food you please, but, for God's sake, don't write 
to them!  In such a place every man knows the other 
has received a letter, and none know what it contains. I cannot have my sisters names in every 
body's mouth. Never do it again!  " All as kind and 
as considerate for us as ever, and a necessary caution; I love him the better for it; but I was dismayed 
for having rendered the reproof necessary. For three 
hours I made the most hideous faces at myself and 
groaned aloud over Brother's displeasure. He is so 
good that I would rather bite my tongue off than 
give him a moment's pain. Just now I went to him, 
unable to keep silence any longer, and told him how 
distressed I was to have displeased him about that 
note. "Don't think any more about it, only don't 
do it again, dear," was his answer. I was so grateful 
to him for his gentleness that I was almost hurried 
into a story. I began, " It is the first time " when 
I caught myself and said boldly, "No, it is not. 
Colonel Steadman has written to me before, and I 
have replied. But I promise to you it shall not occur 
again if I can avoid it." He was satisfied with the 
acknowledgment, and I was more than gratified 
with his kindness. Yet the error must have been on 
the right side! 
</p><p>
Colonel Steadman wrote back his thanks by 
Edmond, with heartfelt gratitude for finding such 
friends in his adversity, and touching acknowledgments of the acceptable nature of the lunch. His 
brother and Colonel Lock were wounded, though 
recovering, and he was anxious to know if I had yet 
recovered. And that was all, except that he hoped 
we would come to see him, and his thanks to Brother 
for his kind message. Brother had sent him word by 
one of the prisoners that though he was not acquainted with him, yet as his sisters friend he would 
be happy to assist him if he needed money or clothing. There was no harm in either note, and though 
I would not do it again, I am almost glad I let him 
know he still had friends before Brother asked me 
not to write. 
</p><p>
And as yet we can't see them. A man was bayoneted yesterday for waving to them, even. It only 
makes us the more eager to see them. We did see 
some. Walking on Rampart Street with the Peirces 
yesterday, in front of a splendid private house, we 
saw sentinels stationed. Upon inquiry we learned 
that General Gardiner and a dozen others were confined there. Ada and Miriam went wild. If it had 
not been for dignified Marie, and that model of propriety, Sarah, there is no knowing but what they 
would have carried the house by storm. We got 
them by without seeing a gray coat, when they 
vowed to pass back, declaring that the street was not 
respectable on the block above. We had to follow. 
So! there they all stood on the balcony above. We 
thought we recognized General Gardiner, Major 
Wilson, Major Spratley, and Mr. Dupr6. Miriam 
was sure she did ; but even when I put on a bold face, 
and tried to look, something kept me from seeing; 
so I had all the appearance of staring, without 
deriving the slightest benefit from it. Wonder what 
makes me such a fool? 
Mr. Conn writes that Captain Bradford is 
wounded, but does not say whether he is here.
