Last evening, after hard labor at pulling molasses candy, needing some relaxation after our severe 
exertions, we determined to have some fun, though the sun was just setting in clouds as watery as <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> milk, and promised an early twilight. All day it had been drizzling, but that was nothing; so Anna Badger, Miriam, and I set off, through the mud, 
to get up the little cart to ride in, followed by cries from the elder ladies of "Girls! Soap is a dollar and 
a half a bar! Starch a dollar a pound ! Take up those skirts ! " We had all started stiff and clean, and it did 
seem a pity to let them drag ; so up they went you can imagine how high when I tell you my answer 
to Anna's question as to whether hers were in danger of touching the mud, was, " Not unless you sit down." 
The only animal we could discover that was not employed was a poor old pony, most appropriately 
called "Tom Thumb," and him we seized instantly, together with a man to harness him. We accompanied him from the stable to the quarter where the 
cart was, through mud and water, urging him on with shouts and cries, and laughing until we could 
laugh no longer, at the appearance of each. The cart had been hauling wood, but that was nothing to us. 
In we tumbled, and with a driver as diminutive as the horse, started off for Mr. Elder's, where we 
picked up all the children to be found, and went on. 
All told, we were twelve, drawn by that poor horse, 
who seemed at each step about to undergo the ham 
process, and leave us his hind quarters, while he 
escaped with the fore ones and harness. I dare say 
we never enjoyed a carriage as much, though each 
was holding a muddy child. Riding was very fine; 
but soon came the question, "How shall we turn?" 
- which was not so easily solved, for neither horse 
nor boy understood it in the least. Every effort to 
describe a circle brought us the length of the cart 
farther up the road, and we promised fair to reach 
Bayou Sara before morning, at that rate. At last, 
after fruitless efforts to dodge under the harness 
and escape, pony came to a standstill, and could 
not be induced to move. The children took advantage of the pause to tumble out, but we sat still. 
Bogged, and it was very dark already! Wouldn't 
we get it when we got home ! Anna groaned, " Uncle 
Albert!" Miriam laughed, "the General!" I sighed, 
"Mrs. Carter!" We knew what we deserved; and 
darker and darker it grew, and pony still inflexible! 
At last we beheld a buggy on a road near by and in answer to Morgan's shouts of "Uncle! Uncle! come 
turn our cart!" a gentleman jumped out and in an instant performed the Herculean task. Pony found 
motion so agreeable that it was with the greatest difficulty we prevailed on him to stop while we fished 
seven children out of the mud, as they pursued his flying hoofs. Once more at Mr. Elder's, we pitched 
them out without ceremony, and drove home as fast as possible, trying to fancy what punishment 
we would receive for being out so late.

Miriam suggested, as the most horrible one, being sent to bed supperless; Anna's terror was the General's displeasure; I suggested being deprived of 
rides in future; when all agreed that mine was the 
most severe yet. So as we drove around the circle, 
those two set up what was meant for a hearty laugh 
to show "they were not afraid," which, however, 
sounded rather shaky to me. I don't think any of us 
felt like facing the elders; Miriam suggested anticipating our fate by retiring voluntarily to bed ; Anna 
thought we had best run up and change our shoes, 
anyway; but at last, with her dare-devil laugh, 
Miriam sauntered into the room, where they all 
were, followed by us, and thrusting her wet feet into 
the fire that was kindled to drive away the damp 
(followed also by us), commenced a laughable account of our fun in which we, of course, followed, 
too. If I had fancied we were to escape scot free, we 
would most surely have got a scolding. It is almost 
an inducement to hope always for the worst ! The 
General did not mention the hour! did not prohibit 
future rides!

While we were yet toasting, a negro came in with what seemed a bank-note, and asked his master to 
see how much it was, as one of the women had sold some of her watermelons to the three soldiers of 
the morning, who had given that to her for a dollar. The General opened it. It was a pass! So vanish all 
faith in human nature! They looked so honest! I could never have believed it of them ! But it looked 
so much like the " shinplasters " we are forced to use, that no wonder they made the mistake. To discover 
who had played so mean a trick on the poor old woman, the General asked me if I could decipher the 
name. I threw myself on my knees by the hearth, and by the flickering light read "'s. Kimes. By order 
of C! H!! Luzenberg! ! ! Provost Marshal! ! ! ! Onolona, Miss.," with a gasp of astonishment that raised 
a burst of laughter against me. Thought he was taken prisoner long ago! At all events, I didn't 
know he had turned banker, or that his valuable autograph was worth a dollar!
