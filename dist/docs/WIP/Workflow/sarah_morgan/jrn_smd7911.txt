I think I grow no better rapidly. Fortunately on Wednesday night they succeeded in turning me over; for my poor elbows, having lost all their skin, 
were completely used up. Now, if I go slowly and carefully, I can turn myself at the cost of some little suffering. . . .

Yesterday Colonel Steadman, of the First Alabama, called with his father. He sent me many 
messages of condolence, and the rather unpleasant 
advice to be cupped and scarified. His profession 
was that of a physician before he became colonel. 
His surgeon, whose name is Madding, told him he 
was satisfied that I was seriously injured, though 
I had not complained. The Colonel is the same 
who called when we were in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>. They readily 
accepted our invitation to dinner, and remained 
until late in the afternoon, when Captain Bradford 
came in. More messages of condolence and sympathy upstairs, which produced no visible effect on 
my spine, though very comforting to the spirit.
