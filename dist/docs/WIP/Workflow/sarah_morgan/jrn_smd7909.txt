In spite of its being Sunday, no sooner was dinner concluded yesterday than we adjourned, as usual, to the sugar-house to see how much damage we could 
do. Each took from a negro his long paddle, and for more than half an hour skimmed the kettles industriously, to the amazement of half a dozen strange 
soldiers who came to see the extraordinary process of sugar-making. At one time the two boys taking possession of the two other paddles, not a negro was 
at the kettles, but stood inspecting our work. The hardest part we found to be discharging the batteries, which none of us could do without their assistance. 
We had no sooner relinquished our paddles than some one announced two gentlemen at the house. While we were discussing the possibility of changing 
our dresses before being seen, enter Mr. Enders and Gibbes Morgan of Fenner's battery. No retreat being possible, we looked charmed and self-possessed 
in spite of plain calicoes and sticky hands. . . . Mr. Enders very conveniently forgot to bring my nuage. He says he started expressly to do so, but 
reflecting that I might then have no inducement to pay that visit to Port Hudson, he left it for another 
time. . . . We arranged a visit to Gibbes, and Mr. Enders made me promise to call at General Beale's 
headquarters for a pass. "They will want you to go to the Provost Marshal's for it, but you just come to General Beale's, and send a courier for 
me, and I will bring it myself!" - and half in fun, half in earnest, I promised.
