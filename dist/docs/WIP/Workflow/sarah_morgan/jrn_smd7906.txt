O what a glorious time we had yesterday ! First, 
there were those two gentlemen to be entertained 
all day, which was rather a stretch, I confess, so I 
stole away for a while. Then I got the sweetest letter from Miss Trenholm, enclosing Jimmy's photo 
graph, and she praised him so that I was in a damp 
state of happiness and flew around showing my picture to everybody, Mr. Bradford included, who 
pronounced him a noble boy, and admired him to 
my satisfaction. Then came a letter from Lilly, 
saying mother had decided to remain in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, and 
wanted us to join her there. O my prophetic soul! 
My heart went below zero! Then Colonel Allen 
sent to Port Hudson for the band to serenade us, 
and raised my spirits in anticipation of the treat. 
While performing my toilet in the evening, Waller 
Fowler arrived, on his way to <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>, bringing 
a letter to Miriam from Major Drum! Heaven only 
knows how it got here! Such a dear, kind letter, 
dated 6th of August, only ! Affairs were very different then, and he said that Lavinia's distress about 
us was such that he must try to send her nearer 
to us. And such an unexpected piece of news! 
Oh, my heart fails me! I cannot fancy Lavinia a mother. 
</p><p>
Slowly I dressed myself, and still more slowly I 
combed Anna. I could think of nothing else until 
I heard Miriam and Mr. Bradford call us to take a 
walk, when we hurried down to them. A race down 
to the railroad, a merry talk standing on the track 
mingled with shouts of laughter in which I tried 
to drown fears for Lavinia, made the early sunset 
clouds pass away sooner than usual, to us, and 
moonlight warned us to return. Mrs. Worley passed 
us in her buggy, coming to stay all night; and half 
way a servant met us, saying two soldiers had come 
to call on us. Once there, I was surprised to find 
that one was Frank Enders, the one I least expected 
to see. The other was a Mr. Harold. I need not 
describe him, beyond this slight indication of his 
style. Before half an hour was over, he remarked 
to Anna that I was a very handsome girl, and 
addressed me as Miss Sally! That is sufficient. 
</p><p>
Then Will Carter came in, and joined our circle. 
His first aside was, "If you only knew how much 
I liked you last night, you would never be cruel to 
me again. Why, I thought you the greatest girl 
in the world! Please let's part friends to-night 
again! I would not promise, for I knew I would 
tease him yet ; and at supper, when I insisted on his 
taking a glass of milk, his face turned so red that 
Mrs. Carter pinched my arm blue, and refused to 
help me to preserves because I was making Will 
mad! But Waller helped me, and I drank my own 
milk to Mr. Carter's health with my sweetest smile. 
"Confound that milkman! I wish he had cut his 
throat before I stumbled over him," he exclaimed 
after tea. But I had more amusing game than to 
make him angry then; I wanted to laugh to get rid 
of the phantom that pursued me, Lavinia. 
</p><p>
The evening passed off very pleasantly; I think 
there were some eighteen of us in the parlor. About 
ten the General went to the sugar-house (he commenced grinding yesterday) and whispered to me to 
bring the young people down presently. Mr. Bradford and I succeeded in moving them, and we three 
girls retired to change our pretty dresses for plain 
ones, and get shawls and nuages, for our warm week 
had suddenly passed away, and it was quite cold 
out. Some of the gentlemen remarked that very few 
young ladies would have the courage to change 
pretty evening dresses for calico, after appearing 
to such advantage. Many would prefer wearing 
such dresses, however inappropriate, to the sugar-mill. With his droll gravity, Gibbes answered, "Oh, 
our girls don't want to be stuck up!" 
</p><p>
There was quite a string of us as we straggled out 
in the beautiful moonlight, with only Mrs. Badger 
as an escort. Mr. Enders and I had a gay walk of it, 
and when we all met at the furnace, we stopped and 
warmed ourselves, and had a laugh before going in. 
Inside, it was lighted up with Confederate gas, in 
other words, pine torches, which shed a delightful 
light, neither too much nor too little, over the different rooms. We tried each by turns. The row of 
bubbling kettles with the dusky negroes bending 
over in the steam, and lightly turning their paddles 
in the foamy syrup, the whole under the influence 
of torchlight, was very interesting; but then, Mr. Enders and I found a place more pleasant still. 
It was in the first purgery, standing at the mouth of 
the shoot through which the liquid sugar runs into 
the car ; and taking the place of the car as soon as it 
was run off to the coolers, each armed with a paddle, 
scraped the colon up and had our own fun while 
eating. Then running along the little railroad to 
where the others stood in the second room over the 
vats, and racing back again all together to eat sugar 
cane and cut up generally around our first pine 
torch, we had really a gay time. 
Presently "Puss wants a corner" was suggested, 
and all flew up to the second staging, under the cane-carrier and by the engine. Such racing for corners ! 
Such scuffles among the gentlemen ! Such confusion 
among the girls when, springing forward for a place, 
we would find it already occupied ! All dignity was 
discarded. We laughed and ran as loud and fast 
as any children, and the General enjoyed our fun 
as much as we, and encouraged us in our pranks. 
Waller surpassed himself, Mr. Bradford carried all 
by storm, Mr. Enders looked like a schoolboy on a 
frolic, Mr. Carter looked sullen and tried lazily not 
to mar the sport completely, while Mr. Harold 
looked timidly foolish and half afraid of our wild 
sport. Mrs. Badger laughed, the General roared, 
Anna flew around like a balloon, Miriam fairly 
danced around with fun and frolic, while I laughed 
so that it was an exertion to change corners. Then 
forfeits followed, with the usual absurd formalities in 
which Mr. Bradford sentenced himself unconsciously 
to ride a barrel, Miriam to make him a love speech 
going home, Mr. Enders to kiss my hand, and I to 
make him (Mr. Enders) a declaration, which I 
instantly did, in French, whereby I suffered no 
inconvenience, as Miriam alone comprehended. 
Then came more sugar-cane and talk in the purgery, 
and we were horrified when Mrs. Badger announced 
that it was twelve o clock, and gave orders to retire. 
</p><p>
O the pleasant walk home! Then, of course, followed a last good-night on the balcony, while the 
two young men mounted their horses and Frank 
Enders vowed to slip off every time he had a chance 
and come out to see us. Then there was a grand 
proposition for a ride to Port Hudson on horseback, 
and in order to secure a pledge that we would pass 
by General Beale's headquarters, Mr. Enders 
wrapped my nuage around his throat, declaring that 
I would be obliged to stop there for it, though, if 
prevented, he would certainly be obliged to bring 
it back himself. This morning, however, the married ladies made so much difficulty about who should 
go, and how, that we were forced to abandon it, 
much as we would have enjoyed it. 
</p><p>
I am afraid to say how late it was when we got 
to bed. I know it was almost ten when we left the 
breakfast-table this morning, so I suppose it must 
have been quite late before we retired. To Colonel Allen's, as well as to our own great disappointment, 
the band could not come on account of sickness.
