[ <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city origin'>Linwood</a> Louisiana ], Friday night, <a rel="month origin" value="1">January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='23'>23rd</a>. [<a href='/results.php?year=1863' rel="origin">1863</a>]
</p><p>
I am particularly happy to-day, for we have just heard from Brother for the first time since last July. And he is well, and happy, and wants us to come to 
him in <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> so he can take care of us, and no longer be so anxious for our safety. If we only could! 
To be sure the letter is from a gentleman who is just out of the city, who says he writes at Brother's earnest request; still it is something to hear, even 
indirectly. One hundred and fifty dollars he encloses with the request that mother will draw for any amount she wishes. Dear Brother, money is the 
least thing we need ; first of all, we are dying for want of a home. If we could only see ours once more! 
</p><p>
During this time we have heard incidentally of Brother ; of his having taken the oath of allegiance 
which I am confident he did not do until Butler's 
October decree of his being a prominent Unionman, of his being a candidate for the Federal congress, and of his withdrawal ; and finally of his having gone to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and Washington, from which 
places he only returned a few weeks since. That is all we ever heard. A very few people have been insolent enough to say to me, "Your brother is as good 
a Yankee as any." My blood boils as I answer, "Let him be <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>President Lincoln</a> if he will, and I would 
love him the same." And so I would. Politics can not come between me and my father's son. What he 
thinks right, is right, for him, though not for me. If he is for the Union, it is because he believes it to be 
in the right, and I honor him for acting from conviction, rather than from dread of public opinion. If he 
were to take up the sword against us to-morrow, Miriam and I, at least, would say, "If he thinks it 
his duty, he is right; we will not forget he is our father's child." And we will not. From that sad 
day when the sun was setting for the first time on our father's grave, when the great, strong man sobbed 
in agony at the thought of what we had lost, and taking us both on his lap put his arms around us and 
said, "Dear little sisters, don't cry; I will be father and brother, too, now," he has been both. He respects our opinions, we shall respect his. I confess 
myself a rebel, body and soul. Confess? I glory in it! Am proud of being one; would not forego the title for any other earthly one! 
</p><p>
Though none could regret the dismemberment of our old Union more than I did at the time, though I 
acknowledge that there never was a more unnecessary war than this in the beginning, yet once in 
earnest, from the secession of Louisiana I date my change of sentiment. I have never since then looked 
back; forward, forward! is the cry; and as the Federal States sink each day in more appalling folly 
and disgrace, I grow prouder still of my own country and rejoice that we can no longer be confounded with a nation which shows so little fortitude in 
calamity, so little magnanimity in its hour of triumph. Yes! I am glad we are two distinct tribes! I am proud of my country; only wish I could fight in 
the ranks with our brave soldiers, to prove my enthusiasm; would think death, mutilation, glorious 
in such a cause; cry, "War to all eternity before we submit." But if I can't fight, being unfortunately a woman, which I now regret for the first time in my 
life, at least I can help in other ways. What fingers can do in knitting and sewing for them, I have done 
with the most intense delight; what words of encouragement and praise could accomplish, I have 
tried on more than one bold soldier boy, and not altogether in vain; I have lost my home and all its 
dear contents for our Southern Rights, have stood on its deserted hearthstone and looked at the ruin of 
all I loved without a murmur, almost glad of the sacrifice if it would contribute its mite towards the 
salvation of the Confederacy. And so it did, indirectly; for the battle of <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> which made 
the Yankees, drunk with rage, commit outrages in our homes that civilized Indians would blush to perpetrate, forced them to abandon the town as 
untenable, whereby we were enabled to fortify Port Hudson here, which now defies their strength. True they have reoccupied our town ; that Yankees live in 
our house ; but if our generals said burn the whole concern, would I not put the torch to our home 
readily, though I love its bare skeleton still? Indeed I would, though I know what it is to be with out one. don't Lilly and mother live in a wretched 
cabin in vile <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> while strangers rest under our father's roof? Yankees, I owe you one for that! 
</p><p>
Well! I boast myself Rebel, sing "Dixie," shout Southern Rights, pray for God's blessing on our cause, without ceasing, and would not live in this 
country if by any possible calamity we should be conquered; I am only a woman, and that is the way 
I feel. Brother may differ. What then? Shall I respect, love him less? No! God bless him! Union or 
Secession, he is always my dear, dear Brother, and tortures could not make me change my opinion.
