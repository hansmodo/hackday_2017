To see a whole city draped in mourning is certainly an imposing spectacle, and becomes almost grand 
when it is considered as an expression of universal 
affliction. So it is, in one sense. For the more violently "Secesh " the inmates, the more thankful they 
are for  <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> death, the more profusely the houses are decked with the emblems of woe. They all look 
to me like "not sorry for him, but dreadfully grieved to be forced to this demonstration." So all things 
have indeed assumed a funereal aspect. Men who have hated  <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> with all their souls, under terror 
of confiscation and imprisonment which they understand is the alternative, tie black crape from every 
practicable knob and point to save their homes. Last evening the B's were all in tears, preparing their 
mourning. What sensibility! What patriotism! a stranger would have exclaimed. But Bella's first 
remark was: "Is it not horrible? This vile, vile old crape! Think of hanging it out when " Tears of 
rage finished the sentence. One would have thought pity for the murdered man had very little to do with it.

Coming back in the cars, I had a <em>rencontre</em> that makes me gnash my teeth yet. It was after dark, 
and I was the only lady in a car crowded with gentlemen. I placed little Miriam on my lap to make room 
for some of them, when a great, dark man, all in black, entered, and took the seat and my left hand 
at the same instant, saying, "Good -evening, Miss Sarah." Frightened beyond measure to recognize 
Captain Todd of the Yankee army in my interlocutor, I, however, preserved a quiet exterior, and with 
out the slightest demonstration answered, as though 
replying to an internal question. "Mr. Todd." "It is a long while since we met," he ventured. "Four 
years," I returned mechanically. "You have been well?" "My health has been bad." "I have been 
ill myself"; and determined to break the ice he diverged with "<a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> has changed sadly." 
"I hope I shall never see it again. We have suffered 
too much to recall home with any pleasure." "I understand you have suffered severely," he said, 
glancing at my black dress. "We have yet one left in the army, though," I could not help saying. He, too, had a brother there, he said.

He pulled the check-string as we reached the house, adding, "This is it," and absurdly correcting 
himself with "Where do you live?" "211. I thank you. Good-evening"; the last with emphasis as he 
prepared to follow. He returned the salutation, and I hurriedly regained the house. Monsieur stood over 
the way. A look through the blinds showed him returning to his domicile, several doors below.

I returned to my own painful reflections. The Mr. Todd who was my "sweetheart" when I was twelve 
and he twenty-four, who was my brother's friend, and daily at our home, was put away from among our 
acquaintance at the beginning of the war. This one, I should not know. Cords of candy and mountains 
of bouquets bestowed in childish days will not make my country's enemy my friend now that I am a woman.
