Day before yesterday, just about this time of evening, as I came home from the graveyard, Jimmy 
unexpectedly came in. Ever since the 12th of February he has been waiting on the Yankees pleasure, in the Mississippi, at all places below <a href='/results.php?city=columbus' rel='city'>Columbus</a>, 
and having been under fire for thirteen days at Tiptonville, Island No. 10 having surrendered Monday night; and Commodore Rollins thinking it 
high time to take possession of the ironclad ram at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, and give them a small party below the forts, he carried off his little aide from the McRae Tuesday morning, and left him here Thursday 
evening, to our infinite delight, for we felt as though we would never again see our dear little Jimmy. He 
has grown so tall, and stout, that it is really astonishing, considering the short time he has been away. . . . 
To our great distress, he jumped up from dinner, and declared he must go to the city on the very next boat. Commodore Hollins would need him, he must be at his post, etc., and in twenty minutes he was off, the rascal, before we could believe he had been here at all. There is something in his eye that reminds 
me of Harry, and tells me that, like Hal, he will die young. 
</p><p>
And these days that are going by remind me of Hal, too. I am walking in our footsteps of last year. The eighth was the day we gave him a party, on 
his return home. I see him so distinctly standing near the pier table, talking to Mr. Sparks, whom he had met only that morning, and who, three 
weeks after, had Harry's blood upon his hands. He is a murderer now, without aim or object in life, as before; with only one desire to die and death 
still flees from him, and he Dares not rid himself of life. 
</p><p>
All those dancing there that night have under gone trial and affliction since. Father is dead, and Harry. Mr. Trezevant lies at Corinth with his skull 
fractured by a bullet; every young man there has been in at least one battle since, and every woman has cried over her son, brother, or sweetheart, going 
away to the wars, or lying sick and wounded. And yet we danced that night, and never thought of bloodshed! The week before Louisiana seceded, 
Jack Wheat stayed with us, and we all liked him so much, and he thought so much of us; and last week a week ago to-day he was killed on the battle-field of Shiloh.
