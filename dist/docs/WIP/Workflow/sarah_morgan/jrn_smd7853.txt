This town, with its ten thousand soldiers, is more 
quiet than it was with the old population of seven 
thousand citizens. With this tremendous addition, 
it is like a graveyard in its quiet, at times. These 
poor soldiers are dying awfully. Thirteen went yesterday. On Sunday the boats discharged hundreds 
of sick at our landing. Some lay there all the after 
noon in the hot sun, waiting for the wagon to carry 
them to the hospital, which task occupied the whole 
evening. In the mean time these poor wretches lay 
uncovered on the ground, in every stage of sickness. 
Cousin Will saw one lying dead without a creature 
by to notice when he died. Another was dying, and 
muttering to himself as he lay too far gone to brush 
the flies out of his eyes and mouth, while no one was 
able to do it for him. Cousin Will helped him, 
though. Another, a mere skeleton, lay in the agonies 
of death, too; but he evidently had kind friends, for 
several were gathered around holding him up, and 
fanning him, while his son leaned over him crying 
aloud. Tiche says it was dreadful to hear the poor 
boy's sobs. All day our vis-&-vis, Baumstark, with 
his several aids, plies his hammer; all day Sunday 
he made coffins, and says he can't make them fast 
enough. Think, too, he is by no means the only 
undertaker here! Oh, I wish these poor men were 
safe in their own land ! It is heartbreaking to see them 
die here like dogs, with no one to say Godspeed. 
The Catholic priest went to see some, sometime ago, 
and going near one who lay in bed, said some kind 
thing, when the man burst into tears and cried, 
"Thank God, I have heard one kind word before I 
die!" In a few minutes the poor wretch was dead.
