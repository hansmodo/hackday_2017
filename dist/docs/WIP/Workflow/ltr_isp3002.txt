DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote you this morning, I have waited on 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>, to consult about our present circumstances, and fix upon the most effectual measure 
that could be pursued against the enemy, who are 
now landing a considerable number of troops at Fort 
Constitution, and proceeding up the river with their 
ships, galleys, flat-bottomed boats, &c. They will, from 
all appearance, be at the chevaux-de-frise in the space 
of an hour. They well know the situation of our 
troops, and I sincerely believe that their intentions 
are to make all expedition to get above us. I do 
not think weighing the chevcmx-de-frise is a matter of 
great moment to them. 
</p><p>
If they cannot effect it with the greatest ease, 
they w T ill proceed up the river with the flat-bottomed 
boats, and such small vessels as can convey the bag 
gage of the troops, stores, &c., to Half-Moon. If 
they attempt to march by land, on the west side the 
river, <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> will annoy them as much as 
possible with about four hundred Continental troops, 
which I yesterday detached over, and the militia, 
which he is now collecting. If this side should be 
their route, I will, with the remainder of the Continental troops and the Connecticut militia (which, I am 
happy to inform your Excellency, are coming in very 
fast), oppose them to the utmost of my power. All 
our stores, baggage, &c., except a few barrels of flour 
and bread, are removed from <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. I have now 
a small guard at that place, and, if I can with any 
safety remove it from thence, I shall be glad. All 
the ordnance stores, which are not immediately wanted, I .have ordered to the eastward. All our bag 
gage, except what is absolutely necessary, I shall 
send off in the morning to some place of security; 
after which my troops will be light, and I flatter 
myself will either be able to fight them, or keep 
pace, should they keep upon the water. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you that many more 
of our troops made their escape than what I was at 
first informed of. Colonel Dubois, who is one of the 
number, this day collected near two hundred of his 
regiment, that got off after the enemy were in the fort. 
About five o clock the enemy demanded a surrender 
of the fort; but, to their surprise, and the honor of 
our commanders, they had an answer that it should 
be defended to the utmost of their power. This renewed the action with double ardor, which continued 
till quite dark, when the enemy (who, we have since 
learnt, were five thousand in number) forced our 
lines ; after which, our troops would not surrender, 
but fought with bayonets, swords, &c., in such a manner as reflects the highest honor on our noble garrison. General James Clinton was wounded with a 
bayonet in his thigh, and a number of other officers 
and men with the same weapon. 
</p><p>
Yours, of the 1st instant, I have this day received. 
The ten pieces of artillery you mention were ordered 
from Springfield by Congress, two of which, from a 
request of General James Clinton, were sent to Fort 
Montgomery ; two I have with me ; and the other six 
are on the other side the river, with <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>. I am, dear General, with great regard, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=isp" rel="me">ISRAEL PUTNAM</a>.

P. S. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> commands the enemy in person, with two other General Officers.
