SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last to you, Mr. Ward, one of the Dele 
gates, hath returned from the Congress. He informs 
me that some of the Bermudians had been at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, soliciting for liberty to import provisions for 
the use of the Island. They gave information of the 
powder mentioned in your letter to me, and were of 
opinion it might be easily obtained. They were told 
by the Delegates, that every vessel they should send 
to the northward with powder should be permitted to 
carry provisions to the Island. Whether their situation will not probably prevent them from bringing 
the powder, I submit to your Excellency. Mr. Porter 
and Mr. Harris are both here. To Mr. Porter, who 
can fully inform you in the matter, I refer you. 
</p><p>
I have forwarded about thirteen hundred pounds 
of lead, which is air that can be procured at present, that article being extremely scarce among us. 
In my last to you, I mentioned that I thought it 
might be brought from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> with more ease 
than it can be procured in any other way; I am 
still of the same opinion. 
</p><p>
I have given orders to the Committee of Safety 
to purchase all the tow-cloth that is to be bought in 
the Government; but I am afraid the quantity will 
be small, the scarcity of coarse linens in the Colony 
having occasioned a great use of that article in families. I am, with great esteem, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
