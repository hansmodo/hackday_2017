MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received yours of 24th, and thank you for 
your relation of our little domestic affairs at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. 
Briesler did not arrive last night, as you calculated. 
His children may detain him longer than you expected. Some of the public offices are about re 
moving to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> this week. I can send James 
with my horses and chariot to meet you at Hoboken 
ferry or <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, or any other place you may 
appoint, and at any time you will appoint, if you can 
be sure of your plans and measures.

I have been, forenoon and afternoon, to church to 
hear Parson Waddell, who gave us two discourses 
good and wholesome for soul, body, and estate. He 
is a good picture of " stalled theology," and is said to 
have a good estate. Last Sunday I went to the Presbyterian church and heard Mr. Grant, an ingenious 
young gentleman. There is something more cheerful and comfortable in an Episcopalian than in a 
Presbyterian church. I admire a great part of the 
Divine service at church very much. It is very humane and benevolent, and sometimes pathetic and 
affecting, but rarely gloomy, if ever. Their creeds 
I could dispense with very well, because the Scriptures being before us contain the creed the most certainly orthodox. But you know I never write nor 
talk upon divinity. I have had more than I could do 
of humanity. Benevolence and beneficence, indus 
try, equity and humanity, resignation and submission, 
repentance and reformation, are the essence of my 
religion. Alas ! how weakly and imperfectly have I 
fulfilled the duties of my own religion ! I look back 
upon a long life very poorly spent in my own estimation. Busy as it has appeared to some, to me it ap 
pears to have been very much too idle, inactive, 
slothful, and sluggish. I fear it is too late to amend. 
My forces are far spent, and by too much exertion I. should soon exhaust them all. I am not in the 
vapors, but in very good spirits, notwithstanding this 
penitent confession of my faults.

Write me every day.
