Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you to day that Mr L. would be in New 
York. I write to you again to say that I think it would be 
well to see him. The whole question of peace or war lies in 
the matter of the deposits. If they are withdrawn, it is a decla 
ration of war. It is wiser therefore to begin the work of peace 
before any irrevocable step is taken.
