MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is proper that I should apprize you that the President has it in contemplation to send your son to Holland, that you may recollect yourself and prepare for 
the event. I make this communication to you in confidence, at the desire of the President, communicated 
to me yesterday by the Secretary of State. You 
must keep it an entire secret until it shall be announced to the public in the journal of the Senate. 
But our son must hold himself in readiness to come 
to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to converse with the President, Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, &c., and 
receive his commissions and instructions without loss 
of time. He will go to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> in the stage, and 
thence to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> by water, and thence to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in the stage. He will not set out, however, 
until he is informed of his appointment. Perhaps 
the Senate may negative him and then his journey 
will be unnecessary. 
</p><p>
I shall go in the stage on Saturday to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
and be at home, I hope, by the 12th of June. 
</p><p>
Adieu. 
</p><p>
