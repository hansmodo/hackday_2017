My dear Sir 
</p><p>
... The fact is that the real sin of the Bank in the 
eyes of the Executive is, that it is refractory &amp; unmanageable. When these people first came into power on a current of 
overwhelming popularity, to which they thought every thing 
should yield, they considered the Bank a part of the spoil, 
and one of their first efforts was to possess themselves of the 
institution for the benefit of their partizans. We saw all that 
would follow from the slightest concession and deter 
mined, since there must be War, to begin it in the frontiers 
by letting them know that they were to have nothing to 
do with the Bank. From that time they resolved, that as\ 
they could not bend it they would break it. This is the whole \ 
secret of the opposition to the institution. I know this so well ) 
that I feel myself a much more profound Jurist than all the \ 
lawyers and all the statesmen of Virginia put together, for in / 
half an hour, I can remove all the constitutional scruples in the 
District of Columbia. Half a dozen Presidencies a dozen 
Cashierships fifty Clerkships a hundred Directorships 
to worthy friends who have no character and no money. 
Why, there is more matter for deep reflection in such a sentence than in any twenty of Tacitus or Montesquieu. It 
would outweigh the best argument of your Madisons &amp; Randolphs &amp; Watkins Leigh s. But that sentence, short and easy 
as it seems, shall never be written or said: and so we must go on to the end of the chapter, and the charter. . . .
