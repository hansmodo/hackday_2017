DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I informed you yesterday, that an encampment of the enemy 
had been discovered at Gilliland's Creek. Last night two of their 
vessels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are 
seven lying at that place. The rest of their fleet is probably but a little lower down, as we hear their morning guns distinctly at 
different places. They have also debarked some troops, and en 
camped upon Chimney Point. Whether they have landed at 
Crown Point, or not, my scout-boat did not discover, not daring 
to venture far enough down the lake, on account of the shipping; 
but I have sent out a scout on this side, which, I doubt not, will 
bring a just account of their situation. 
</p><p>
I cannot help repeating to you the disagreeable situation we 
are in ; nor can I see the least prospect of our being able to defend the post, unless the militia come in. And should the enemy 
protract their operations, or invest us, and content themselves 
with a simple blockade, we are infallibly ruined. 
</p><p>
I have thoughts of calling for the Berkshire militia, which are 
nearest to us, and will probably be the most alert to come to our assistance, because they are in some measure covered by this 
post; but on that I shall consult the other General Officers. This, 
however, is clear to me, that we shall be obliged to abandon this 
side, and then they will soon force the other from us; nor do I 
see that a retreat will in any shape be practicable. Every thing, 
however, shall be done that is possible to frustrate the enemy's 
designs. But what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked, 
and unaccoutred ? I shall write you again as soon as the scout 
returns ; and am, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
ARTHUR ST. CLAIR.
