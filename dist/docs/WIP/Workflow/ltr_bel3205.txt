DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of your very obliging favor of the 
28th of September, the last evening. I wish it was 
in my power to give you such an account of matters 
in this department, as would afford you some satisfaction in the perusal ; but, Unfortunately for me, and 
perhaps it may soon be more so for the public, I 
cannot do it. We remain unsupported by troops, unsupplied with many essential articles, and uncovered 
with works ; and, what adds to the unhappiness, is 
the little prospect that our affairs will speedily be in a better channel. For, with regard to troops, General 
Scott is not arrived, nor do I know when he may be 
expected, for I have not had a line from him since 
he was ordered this way ; but, from the best information I can obtain, if he comes at last, he has not 
more than four hundred men now fit for duty. 
</p><p>
That is all we are encouraged to expect from Virginia, which, with those here from that State, will 
amount to between six and seven hundred ; from 
North Carolina, we have about one hundred and fifty 
Continental troops. More may not be expected from 
them, excepting militia. What number of those may 
be sent is uncertain ; and, indeed, unless they serve 
for a longer time than the last (namely, three months 
from the time they entered this state, a time too 
short, either to learn the duty, or to be inured to 
the fatigues of the camp), little may be expected 
from them. With regard to this State, they have not, 
in their five regiments, seven hundred men fit for 
duty ; and we have no reason to expect that their 
number will be much augmented, considering the 
aversion the people have for the service here ; or that 
any permanent force will be brought by them into 
the field. For, after solemn debate in the House of 
Assembly, they resolved, that the militia should not 
be drafted to fill up the Continental battalions, and 
that the militia, when in the field, should not be under the Continental articles of war ; and refused, on 
the recommendation of Congress, to raise any black 
corps. The Georgia battalion does not amount to one hundred men in the whole ; they are not in a capa 
city to keep that number up, for they have no legislative power in the State. The militia, therefore, are 
not properly organized, nor can be ; they come out at 
their own option, and return at their discretion. 
</p><p>
Thus, Sir, you see the state of our force, and our expectations. We are very deficient in many necessary articles, such as ammunition, tent-cloth, blankets, 
clothes, c. This arises, in a great measure, from a 
large proportion of the vessels being taken, which 
were sent out hence for the public, and from others 
coming to a bad market. 
</p><p>
This town, which is the magazine of the State, and 
which, for that and many reasons, claims the attention of the enemy, and to possess themselves of which 
is among their first objects, is in a very defenceless 
situation. The works about it, begun, are not finished ; many more are necessary to be constructed, but 
from the want of negroes (the only laborers in this 
country), the matter is neglected. They have been 
sent for into the country, but, from some defect in 
the law, they are not brought in. 
</p><p>
Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan's Island, six miles from 
the town, supposed to be the key of the harbour, is 
in a very decayed state, and without a ditch, pickets, or abatis to it. The repairs of that, also, are delayed from the same cause. Two floating batteries 
have been recommended to cover the bar, and they 
would undoubtedly answer the most valuable purpose, 
as no heavy ship can come over it, unless they take 
out their guns, or they are so much careened as 
they cannot work them. These, also, though indispensably necessary to the safety of the harbour, are 
unprovided. 
By this short state of affairs, you will see what 
little expectations there are., that we shall be able to 
make any considerable defence, in case any thing 
serious is attempted here by the enemy. Besides, if 
they should attack the town, I think they will at 
tempt to amuse us in the back parts of the country, 
and keep those people at home ; indeed, there has 
been a late attempt to seize our magazines at Ninety Six and Camden. A very considerable number 
of men got in arms, but their designs were fortunately discovered, and many of them are taken. Yet 
the combination is alarming, and requires particular attention, considering what great proportion of the 
back inhabitants of these States are unfriendly and 
indifferent to the cause. 
</p><p>
I have frequently, and, I think, faithfully, represented these matters to Congress, and to this State ; 
and have endeavoured to convince them, by every argument in my power, that this State also was surely 
an object which claimed the attention of Britain, 
and policy, as it would affect us, and interest, would 
stimulate her to attempt the subjugation of it. We 
have about one thousand Continental troops in this 
State, and at <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, in Georgia. The Virginia dra 
goons and infantry are at <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>. They were sent there on our retreat from before <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, in order 
to give confidence to the inhabitants and the militia 
of the country, and to be some check on the unfriendly, and the Indians. The second, third, and 
fifth South Carolina battalions, and part of the artillery, are at Sheldon, opposite Port Royal Ferry, and 
between thirty and forty miles from the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, 
as a cover to the country, while the people take in 
their crops, and remove their stock, which should be 
done immediately. The first and sixth battalions are 
at Fort Moultrie, and the North Carolina troops in 
this town. 
</p><p>
As soon as it shall become necessary, I mean to 
collect the Continental troops to a point, and to 
leave the well-affected militia to cover the back part 
of the country. They will render more service there 
than in garrison. The militia in the vicinity of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will be called in to its aid. I have re 
quested the State to provide some secure place, properly supplied with provisions, as an asylum for the 
aged, the infirm, the women, and children ; that, in 
case of a siege, we may have no useless mouths in 
town, or any circumstance which would induce a 
more early surrender, or add to the absolutely necessary distresses of a siege. 
</p><p>
I think this town might be defended against a 
very formidable attack, if all was done for its security which ought to be done. For it is situated on a 
peninsula our lines in the rear of it are about half a mile in length, and will soon have in front of 
them, at the distance of a musket shot, a fosse, in 
which the water wilL be retained six or seven feet 
by dams, one towards Cooper, and the other towards 
Ashley River ; this completed, and the necessary 
works about the town finished, and the floating batteries provided, we should not be easily insulted, 
with a proper garrison and magazines, I am, my 
dear General, with the warmest sentiments of regard 
and esteem, unalterably yours, 
</p><p>
