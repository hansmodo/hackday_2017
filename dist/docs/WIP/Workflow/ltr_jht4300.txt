Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Having had the satisfaction to accord with you in 
the sentiment of retiring from the busy cares of public life, to the tranquil scenes of private enjoyment, 
I anticipate, with much pleasure, the reflections which 
such a state will enable us to make upon the happy 
issue of those anxious and perplexing vicissitudes 
through which, in the course of an eight years' unusual war, you and I have had the lot to pass, and, 
in the cares and solicitudes of which, we have borne 
no ignoble part. 
</p><p>
I felicitate you, Sir, with great cordiality, on your having already reached the goal of your wishes, and 
most devoutly invoke the Divine benediction on your enjoyments and pursuits. A month more, I trust, will 
bring me to the haven of retirement ; in the tranquillity of which I hope to have leisure to attend to and 
cultivate those seeds of private friendship, which have 
been planted during the tumults of war, and in the 
cultivation of which I promise myself to reap much pleasure. 
</p><p>
Indulging these prospects, I am induced to wish, 
and even to hope, that the correspondence between 
you and me, which commenced under the pressure 
of disagreeable circumstances, may not wholly cease 
when we find ourselves in a happier situation. Although enveloped in the shades of retirement, the 
busy mind cannot suppress its activity, but will be 
seeking some employment, which will indeed be necessary to dispel that languor which a scene of inactivity would be apt to produce. Subjects will not be 
wanting ; far different, and more agreeable, I trust, 
than those we have been accustomed to dwell upon; 
and occasions will present which may serve to beguile 
a lingering hour, and afford some pleasing amusement, 
or instructive information. Let not the disparity of 
age, or the idea of a correspondent seventy-three 
years advanced on his journey through life, chill 
your expectations from this proposal. I promise you 
my best endeavours; and when you perceive, as too 
soon, alas ! you may, that your returns are not proportional to your disbursements, you have only to 
cease your correspondence ; I shall submit. 
</p><p>
The fruits of our peace and independence do not, 
at present, wear so promising an appearance as I 
had fondly painted to my mind. The jealousies, the 
prejudices, and turbulence of the people, at times, 
almost stagger my confidence in our political establishment, and almost occasion me to think that they 
will show themselves unworthy the noble prize for 
which we have contended, and which, I had pleased 
myself, was so near our enjoyment. But again, I 
check this rising impatience, and console myself under the present prospect, with the consideration that 
the same beneficent and wise <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> which has 
done so much for this country, will not eventually 
leave us to ruin our own happiness, to become the 
sport of chance, or the scoff of an admiring world; 
but that great things are still in store for this people, 
which time, and the wisdom of the Great Director, 
will produce in its best season. In this better confidence, I bid you adieu for the present, wishing you 
every felicity, while I subscribe myself, with sincere 
esteem, and the most affectionate regard, &c. &c., 
</p><p>
