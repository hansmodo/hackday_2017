I am, my dear Janet, so exceedingly out of spirits and so chagrined with the behavior of the troops, that I most heartily 
repent having undertaken to lead them. I went down the river 
the other day with 800 or 900 men, in order to rut off the communication between <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city origin'>St. Johns</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. The detachment 
marched off from the boats at night, and in less than half an hour, returned in the utmost confusion, some little noise having 
been made by a few of our own stragglers in the bushes. They 
gave way near the front, and the panic spreading, they were like sheep, with some few exceptions, nor can I say who behaved 
worst. With solicitation, entreaty and reproaches, I got them 
off again, and in less than an hour they came back, having behaved almost as infamously as at first. In their last excursion 
the advanced guard surprised a Canadian officer and some Indians in a hut ; the officer and one Indian were killed, but the 
firing of two or three shot set the whole line a-firing without 
any object. The commanding officer, who was Ritzma, represented the impracticability of getting the' detachment off. The 
next morning I tried again with as little success. In short, such a set of pusillanimous wretches never were collected. Could I, 
with decency, leave the army in its present situation, I would not serve an hour longer. I am much afraid the general character of the people has been too justly represented. However, 
there are some whose spirit I have confidence in ; they are taking pains with the men, and they flatter me with hopes of 
prevailing on them to retrieve their characters. We were so unfortunate as to have some Canadians witnesses of our disgrace ! 
What they will think of the brave Bostonians, I know not! My own feelings tell me they are not likely to put confidence 
in such friends. Shew this to your <a href="/results.php?tla=rol" rel="kin met">father</a> only ; it can't be of service to our common cause to make known our weakness. 
</p><p>
May I have better news to write hereafter !

Adieu, my dearest Janet
</p><p>
Believe me most affectionately yours,
