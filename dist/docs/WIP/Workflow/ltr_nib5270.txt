My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . Here is the Bank which most assuredly has been 
in its proper sphere, perfectly true, and faithful, to the ad 
ministration; and which has never suffered itself, even while 
it believed itself very unkindly treated, to be betrayed into 
the slightest departure from its duty to the Govt. All the 
members of the Govt. can bear witness to this. The President 
himself has no hostile feeling towards the Bank, he is dis 
posed to agree to its renewal with certain modifications, and 
the Bank is disposed to accept these modifications. And yet 
with no real difference between them, they are now playing 
into the hands of his enemies, who desire nothing better than to see us at variance. This certainly cannot be right. Is it not 
wiser for the Presidents friends to disarm at once his antagonists, of their strongest weapon, to settle the question at 
once; and thus unite all the Presi friends before the next election? This seems so clear, and obvious, that I am astonished that his friends do not immediately take the matter into their own hands, and settle it their own way. 
</p><p>
Now what should prevent this reconciliation ? If the President is restrained from making any advances, I have no such 
&gt;feeling, &amp; I will make them myself. You know that I care nothing about the election. I care only for the interests confided to my care, and so far from having the least ill will 
toward the President, so far from wishing to embarrass his administration, I will do every thing consistent with my 
duty, to relieve it from trouble, and will go nine tenths of the way to meet him in conciliation. This is very easy. The whole can be settled in five minutes. 
</p><p>
For instance, the President wishes some modifications in the charter. Well, let him take the charter and make any 
changes he likes, let him write the whole charter with his 
own hands, I am sure that we would agree to his modifications; and then let him and his friends pass it. It will 
then be his work. He will then disarm his adversaries, he 
will gratify his friends, and remove one of the most uncomfortable and vexatious public questions that can be stirred. 
</p><p>
Now why could not this be? The moment is propitious and if done soon it will be done triumphantly. Do think of all 
these things, &amp; if as a friend of the President, as well as of the Bank, you can accomplish this work of peaceful mediation, 
you will relieve both parties from an apparent misunderstanding, you will confer a real benefit upon the country &amp; 
especially gratify,
 
Yours with great regard
