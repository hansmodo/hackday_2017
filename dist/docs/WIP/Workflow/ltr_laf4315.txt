My dear General, 
</p><p>
What could have been my feelings, had the news 
of your illness reached me before I knew my beloved 
General, my adoptive father, w\as out of danger? I 
was struck with horror at the idea of the situation 
you have been in, while I, uninformed and so distant from you, was anticipating the long waited-for pleasure to hear from you, and the still more endearing 
prospect to visit you, and present you the tribute of a revolution, one of your first offsprings. 
</p><p>
For God's sake, my dear General, take care of 
your health ! Do not devote yourself so much to the 
Cabinet, while your habit of life has, from your young 
years, accustomed you to constant exercise. Your 
conservation is the life of your friends, the salvation 
of your country. It is for you a religious duty, not 
to neglect what may concern your health. I beg you 
will let me oftener hear from you. I write when an 
opportunity offers ; and to my great sorrow I hear 
my letters must have miscarried, or been detained. 
But, as our correspondence can have no other bounds 
but the opportunities to write, it was not a reason, 
give me leave to say, for you to miss any that may 
have offered; and you may easily guess what I am 
exposed to suffer, what would have been my situation, had I known your illness before the news of 
your recovery had comforted a heart so affectionately 
devoted to you. 
</p><p>
This letter will be delivered by two gentlemen (one 
of them an artillery officer) who are going to settle on 
the banks of the famed Scioto. How profitable the 
scheme may be to them, I do not determine ; but, as 
they personally are entitled to regard, and are much 
recommended to me, I beg you will honor them with 
your kind reception and good advices. 
</p><p>
The proceedings of the National Assembly cannot 
fail being known to you. We have run or cut down 
every thing that was, and perhaps it was the only 
way to get rid of the innumerable obstacles that opposed our revolution. We afterwards have made an 
immense emission of resolves, constitutional, legislative, administrative ; and, of the latter, a great deal 
too much. Happy it has been for us, that I persuaded the Assembly to begin with a declaration of 
rights ; as, among our decrees, few may be found that 
are not consonant with the most perfect principles of 
natural rights ; so that, our errors being on the popular side, and of the speculative turn, monarchical influence and practice will fit us to meet, in a few 
years, a second Convention; while, had we got halfway only, or taken another rule than that of nature. 
it would have been impossible to conquer our difficulties, or destroy our prejudices. It is from such a 
motive that I have been so eager to root out, not 
only the reality, but even the smallest appearance, of 
aristocracy among us. 
</p><p>
Now we are disturbed with revolts among the regiments ; and as I am constantly attacked on both 
sides, by the aristocratic and factious party, I do not 
know to which of the two we owe these insurrections. Our safeguard against them is with the national guard. There is more than a million of armed 
citizens ; among them patriotism reigns, and my influence with them is as great as if I had accepted 
the chief command. I have lately lost some of my 
favor with the mob, and displeased the frantic lovers 
of licentiousness, as I am bent on establishing a legal subordination ; but the nation at large are very 
thankful to me for it. It is not out of the heads of 
the aristocrats, to make a counter revolution. Nay, 
they do what they can with all the crowned heads 
of Europe, who hate us ; but I think their plans will 
be either abandoned or unsuccessful. I am rather 
more concerned with a division that rages in the 
popular party. The clubs of the Jacobins, and of 
Eighty-Nine, as it is called, have divided the friends 
of liberty, who accuse each other ; the Jacobins being taxed with a disorderly extravagance, and EightyNine with a tincture of ministerialism and ambition. 
I am endeavouring to bring about a reconciliation. 
The affair of the Gth of October will be reported in 
the House next week. I do not think there will be 
against the Duke of Orleans, and am sure there are 
not against Mirabeau, sufficient charges to impeach 
them. There is something cloudy in the present system of those two men, although they do not seem 
actually connected. They are both cowards, but the 
prince most particularly so. 
</p><p>
I hope our business will end with the year, at 
which time this so-much blackened, this ambitious 
dictator, your friend, will most deliciously enjoy the 
happiness to give up all power, all political cares, 
and to become a private citizen in a free monarchy, 
the Constitution of which, although I could not help 
its being defective now, will lay a foundation for the 
most excellent one to be made in a few years. 
</p><p>
The people begin to be a little tired with the revolution and the Assembly j one part to be ascribed 
to the French temper and numberless private losses ; 
the other part owing to the faults of the Assembly, 
the intrigues and the ambition of most of its leaders. But we have got wind enough to run the ship 
into the harbour. 
</p><p>
I depend on my friend Short to give you political 
intelligence. His abilities, zeal, and the affection and 
esteem he enjoys, put him in a situation to give you 
the best information. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and myself know 
his worth, and can warrant it. He is a most valuable man to do American business here. My best 
respects wait on Mrs. Washington. I beg you to 
present my tenderest compliments to Hamilton, Knox, 
Jefferson. Be so kind as to show them my letter, 
as well as to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a>, to whom I also beg my affectionate compliments, and to all friends. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General. Madame de Lafayette 
and family join in affectionate respects to you and 
Mrs. Washington. Most tenderly and respectfully I 
have the honor to be. 
</p><p>
My beloved General, your devoted friend,
