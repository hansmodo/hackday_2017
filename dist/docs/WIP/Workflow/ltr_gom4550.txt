Sir, 
</p><p>
I received from Major Hosgiil, who arrived here on the twenty first instant, the two letters which you did me the honor to 
write upon the thirteenth of October. I shall, in consequence, 
set off for London as soon as I possibly can. When last in 
thai city, I saw the Duke of Leeds twice at the French Ambassador s, and from some slight circumstances was induced to 
believe, that the British court are better disposed towards a connexion with the United States, than they were some eighteen 
months ago. The principal difficulty will, I imagine, arise from 
the personal character of the King, which is that of perseverance, and from the personal dislike, which he bears to his for 
mer subjects. I have the honor to be, &tc.
