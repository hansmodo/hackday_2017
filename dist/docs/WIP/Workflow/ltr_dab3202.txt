DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The savages have already begun their hostilities. 
Last Sunday, they killed five men at a sugar camp 
upon Raccoon Creek, in Youghiogany county, and 
took prisoners three girls and three lads. It is generally conjectured that the Delawares perpetrated this 
murder ; but it is possible it may have been done by 
other Indians. If the Delaware nation should declare 
against us, this frontier will be greatly distressed ; 
as many other nations, who have hitherto been neutral, will join them, and my force is by no means 
sufficient to protect the settlements. I have inclosed 
to the Adjutant-General a return of the troops for 
the month of February, since which near to fifty men 
have been discharged from the ninth Virginia regiment, and many more will expect their discharges 
very soon. 
</p><p>
I have lately been favored with a letter from Colonel Clark, declaring his readiness to cooperate with 
me in any measure I shall undertake, either for the 
reduction of one of the enemy's posts, or against the 
Indian towns. He is now at the Illinois, and will be 
considerably reenforced in the course of this spring. 
He proposes throwing up some works at the mouth 
of the Ohio River. If your Excellency can possibly 
spare a small reenforcement of well-appointed regular troops for this district, I will pledge my honor to be 
as active as circumstances and situation will admit. 
</p><p>
I am exceedingly anxious to receive a line from 
you; and have the honor to be, with the most perfect regard and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
