DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you very fully by Falconer, of February 17, and 
have since received yours of January 21, together with one 
from the Committee, and the messages which, as you will 
see by my answer to the Committee, I communicated to Lord 
Hillsborough. His Lordship read them deliberately, and 
took notice that the message of the Assembly seemed to insinuate, that the governor had been tardy in bringing the 
former murderers to justice, which gave me an opportunity 
of explaining that matter to him; whereby he might also 
understand why the Proprietor had not shown him the messages when he communicated the governor's letter concerning 
the Indian uneasinesses, the law under his consideration for 
removing them, the late murder, and his proclamation. I 
shall wait on his Lordship again next Wednesday, on our 
affairs, and show him moreover your letter with some other 
papers. 
</p><p>
The old Parliament is gone, and its enemies now find themselves at liberty to abuse it. I inclose you a pamphlet, published the very hour of its prorogation. All the members are 
now in their counties and boroughs among their drunken 
electors; much confusion and disorder in many places, and 
such profusion of money as never was known before on any 
similar occasion. The first instance of bribery to be chosen 
a member, taken notice of on the journals, is no longer ago 
than Queen Elizabeth's time, when the being sent to Parliament was looked upon as a troublesome service, and therefore not sought after. It is said that such a one, "being a 
simple man, and conceiving it might be of some advantage to 
him, had given jour pounds to the mayor and corporation, 
that they might choose him to serve them in Parliament." 
</p><p>
The price is monstrously risen since that time, for it is now 
no less than four thousand pounds! It is thought, that near 
two millions will be spent this election ; but those, who understand figures and act by computation, say the crown has two 
millions a year in places and pensions to dispose of, and it is 
well worth while to engage in such a seven years' lottery, 
though all that have tickets should not get prizes. I am, my 
dear friend, yours affectionately, B. FRANKLIN.
