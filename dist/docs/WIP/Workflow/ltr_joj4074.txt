My good Friend, 
</p><p>
It gave me pleasure to receive your obliging letter of the 
30th December, and the more so, as the one to Sally which 
accompanies it contains agreeable accounts of your health. 
Accept my thanks for the kind wishes which the season 
gave you occasion to offer. In your sincerity I have full 
confidence ; and in your happiness, I feel that interest 
which long-confirmed esteem and attachment never fails to 
create. 
</p><p>
If the ensuing summer should bring us all together in 
health and spirits, I shall think the day of my arrival one 
of the most fortunate of my life. After having passed so 
many years in scenes of trouble and difficulty of various 
kinds, I look forward with emotion not to be described to 
that peaceful circle of my friends and family, where I again 
expect to meet the enjoyments which have so long deserted 
me. God only knows what futurity may have in store for 
us, or what adverse events may still continue to teach us 
lessons of resignation. It is happy for us, however, that 
hope is our constant companion, and that new expectations 
constantly succeed the disappointment of preceding ones. 
</p><p>
Having expected that Mr. Carmichael would have arrived 
with the public accounts in time to have them settled 
before the A] nil packet engaged her passengers, I had 
taken steps for going in her ; but he did not reach Paris till 
the 27th ult., and Mr. Barclay, who is to settle them, being 
then and still absent, I must necessarily be detained here 
till in May. I hope, but am not sure, that I shall then embark. In matters which do not depend upon myself, or 
people like you, I dare not be sanguine. Such of our baggage as is not in immediate use, is already packed up. 
</p><p>
Your accounts of my dear boy please me. Tell him his 
endeavours to gain knowledge, and practise virtue, will 
increase and secure my affection for him. 
</p><p>
Remember me to all the family ; and believe me to be, 
</p><p>
Dear Kate, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and brother, 
</p><p>
