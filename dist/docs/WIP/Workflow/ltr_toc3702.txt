Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to receive your Excellency's favor of the 1st of January by express. I am not insensible that the delicacy of your station in the empire renders it ineligible for you to address me in 
my public character. Your noticing us, therefore, in 
your private capacity, under our circumstances, I beg 
leave to esteem as the strongest mark of your magnanimity and friendship. 
</p><p>
While we receive with gratitude the resolves of 
Congress, of the 7th and 21st of August last, it affords us great satisfaction that your Excellency is 
willing to consider them as implying the right, which 
Vermont claims, to be a State, within certain described bounds. And, as the dispute of boundary is the 
only one that hath prevented our union with the Confederacy, I am very happy in being able to acquaint 
your Excellency that that is now removed on our 
part, by our withdrawing our claims upon New Hampshire and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and by confining ourselves solely, or very nearly, to that tract of country which is 
described in the resolve of Congress of the 21st of August last. Since, therefore, we have withdrawn our 
jurisdiction to the confines of our old limits, we entertain the highest expectations that we shall soon obtain what we have so long been seeking after, an 
acknowledgment of independence and sovereignty. 
For this we have appointed Commissioners, with plenary powers to negotiate an alliance with the Confederated States, and, if they succeed, to take seats 
in Congress. 
</p><p>
Should Heaven prosper the design of their negotiation, we please ourselves much that we, who are of 
one sentiment in the common cause, and who have 
but one common interest, shall yet become one nation, 
and yet be great and happy. The glory of America 
is our glory, and with our country we mean to live 
or die, as her fate shall be. 
</p><p>
I have no need to acquaint your Excellency, that 
our local as well as our military (not to say political) 
situation, as an extended frontier, awfully exposeth 
these infant plantations to the power and fury of the 
common enemy. Might we be so happy as to draw 
the attention of our country, we hope to be favored 
with your particular exertion. I have the honor to 
be. Sir, with great respect. 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=toc" rel="me">Thomas Chittenden</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. This will be delivered by one of our agents, 
to whom I beg leave to refer your Excellency for 
the more particular situation of this State, with regard to military preparations and state of defence.
