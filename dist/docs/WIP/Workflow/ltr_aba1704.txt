<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>, Sunday Evening, 14 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1767">1767</a>.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE Doctor talks of setting out to-morrow for New 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>. I did not know but that he might chance 
to see you in his way there. I know from the tender affection you bear me and our little ones, that 
you will rejoice to hear that we are well. Our son 
is much better than when you left home, and our 
daughter rocks him to sleep with the song of Come, 
papa, come home to brother Johnny." Sunday seems 
a more lonely day to me than any other when you 
are absent ; for, though I may be compared to those 
climates which are deprived of the sun half the 
year, yet upon a Sunday you commonly afforded us 
your benign influence. I am now at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>, my 
father brought me here last night ; to-morrow I return home, where I hope soon to receive the dearest 
of friends, and the tenderest of husbands, with that 
unabated affection which has for years past, and will 
whilst the vital spark lasts, burn in the bosom of your affectionate 
</p><p>
