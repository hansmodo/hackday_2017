DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was, some time since, honored with yours of the 
28th ultimo, respecting clothing for the recruits, and, 
this morning, with that of the 17th instant. 
</p><p>
Several officers have already come from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> 
on the recruiting service, and others are on the road. 
I wish they may be successful, but am at a loss, from 
the tenor of your Excellency's letter, to determine what bounty the recruits, raised by this State (Massachusetts), are to receive. It seems the Continental 
bounty, after the act of March, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>, was to be two 
hundred dollars. The General Assembly of this State, 
on the 30th of September last, passed the following 
resolution, namely ; " Resolved, that a bounty of 
three hundred dollars, in addition to the bounty and 
subsistence-money allowed by Congress, be paid to 
each non-commissioned officer and soldier, who has or 
shall enlist as one of this State's quota of the Continental army, during the continuance of the present 
war between the United States of America and Great 
Britain." This bounty appears to be intended over 
and above the Continental bounty, and extended to 
all the soldiers belonging to their quota of the army 
enlisted at any preceding period. I purpose, to-morrow, to lay the matter before the Assembly, who, it 
is probable, may have received some particular instruction on the subject, or, at least, that they may 
conduct as they think proper. 
On Tuesday last two privateers, belonging to Salem (the Franklin and Jack), sent into that port a 
large letter-of-niarcjue ship, having on board one thou 
sand barrels of pork and beef, seven hundred and 
fifty barrels of flour, eight hundred firkins of butter, 
and dry goods to the amount of fifteen thousand 
pounds. 
</p><p>
A Dr. Apedale, lately come from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and, some time before, from Canada to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, reports, that before he left Canada, it was said 
that about one thousand regulars and Tories, with as 
many Indians as could be collected and would join 
them, were to make an excursion on our frontiers on 
the Mohawk River, as soon as the season was suit 
able, in two divisions, under the command of John 
son and Butler; and that Lieutenant-Colonel Stacy 
was held a prisoner in Canada with a view to be 
exchanged for Johnson or Butler, should either of 
them happen to be taken. How much credit is to 
be given to this report, your Excellency may be able 
best to determine. 
</p><p>
I have the happiness to forward this by Major-General the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, who arrived at 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> on the 28th instant, where he was received 
with every demonstration of joy. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
