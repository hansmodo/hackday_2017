Sir, 
</p><p>
A new disposition of the army going to be made, 
and an officer appointed to the command of West 
Point and the district on the east side of the North 
River, I take the liberty just to intimate my inclinations for the appointment. Your Excellency will 
judge of the propriety, and determine as the honor 
of the army and the good of the service may require. 
</p><p>
I hope there is nothing indelicate or improper in 
the application. I am prompted to the measure from 
the feelings incident to the human heart, as well as 
encouraged in the hope that it would meet your approbation, from the flattering manner in which you 
have been pleased to speak of my conduct upon different occasions, I shall make use of no arguments, 
being persuaded my pretensions and inclinations will 
have their full operation, and that notliing short of 
the public good and military prosperity will contravene my wishes. 
</p><p>
My first object is the freedom and happiness of 
my country. With these, your Excellency's reputation and glory are inseparably connected ; and as it 
has been my constant wish, so it shall be my future 
endeavour, to promote the establishment of both. 
</p><p>
I am, &c. 
</p><p>
