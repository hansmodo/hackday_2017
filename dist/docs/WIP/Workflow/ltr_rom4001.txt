Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You have not heard from me so often as you had a right 
to expect. I lament, but cannot help it. Constant employment puts it out of my power to do many things I wish to 
do, and that of writing to my friends is among the number. 
My private letters, however, cannot be of much consequence, and you must accept the will for the deed. 
</p><p>
I cannot take time at present to enter on any political 
discussions. But you must allow me to declare my perfect 
satisfaction in, and approbation of, your conduct in Europe. 
All who have had the opportunity of knowing what it has 
been, are struck with admiration at your patience under 
difficulties, and your firmness in rising superior to them. 
Go on, my friend ; you deserve and will receive the gratitude of your country. History will hand down your plaudit 
to posterity. The men of the present day, who are generally least grateful to their contemporaries, esteem it an 
honour to be of your acquaintance. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to hear that Mrs. Jay and yourself have been indisposed, but I hope you are recovered, and partaking 
the enjoyments of this season with the gay, sprightly inhabitants of Versailles and Paris. My best wishes ever attend you. 
</p><p>
Your friend <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur</a> writes you political letters, but as he tells you nothing of himself, it is just that I tell you, how industrious, how useful he is ; his talents and abilities 
you know ; they are all faithfully and disinterestedly applied to the service of his country. I could do nothing without him, and our joint labours do but just keep the wheels in motion. 
</p><p>
With sincere attachment, 
</p><p>
I am, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rom" rel="me">Robert Morris<a/>.
