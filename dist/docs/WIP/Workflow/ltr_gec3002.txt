DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Immediately on the receipt of your Excellency's 
letter, directing from one thousand to fifteen hundred 
of the militia of this and the State of Connecticut, 
to reenforce this garrison and the army under <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, I issued orders for drawing out eight 
hundred and ten, including non-commissioned officers, 
from this State, for the above purposes. Since which 
I have been induced, from the situation of our affairs 
to the northward, in addition to the above numbers, 
to order out five hundred of the militia from the northern parts of Ulster and Duchess counties, one 
thousand from the county of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and five hundred from the county of Try on, to reenforce the 
army under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, and 
to continue in service until the first day of November next, unless your Excellency shall think proper 
to dismiss them before. Those from the two former 
counties, I have reason to believe, are by this time 
on their march, but I have not yet been advised 
what success they have experienced in getting the 
proportion allotted for the other counties. I fear, not 
so good as could be wished. The people in that 
quarter consider the Western frontier equally liable 
to the invasions of the enemy, and, influenced by 
this consideration, are unwilling to leave their families exposed, and join our army. As the enemy 
advance, many of the best of the inhabitants are 
employed in moving off their families and effects. 
Indeed, I have always observed that the militia of 
any part of the country most in danger, are, for the 
above reasons, least forward in opposing an enemy. 
Some, too, decline acting under those circumstances, 
from unworthy principles. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 1st instant, dated 
at Chester, I received in Kingston, on Wednesday 
last, and thereupon ordered four regiments of militia 
to this place, three to join <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> at Peeks-kill, and one to occupy the post at the mouth of the 
Clove. The last of those ordered here arrived yesterday, and I learn from <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, that those 
designed for him are also arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. All 
the remainder of the militia of the State are under 
marching orders. 
</p><p>
I never knew the militia come out with greater 
alacrity ; but as many of them yet have great part 
of their harvests in the field; I fear it will be difficult to detain them long, unless the enemy make 
some movements that indicate a design of coming 
this way suddenly, and so obvious as to be believed 
by the militia. I cannot but express my surprise 
that no reinforcements, as I have heard, have yet 
arrived to our northern army from the eastward. 
The want of confidence in the General Officers to 
the northward, is the specious reason. To me it appears a very weak one. The mutilated and distressed 
condition of this State renders our utmost exertions 
to oppose the common enemy, in appearance but 
little, better than one half of it being out of our possession. Common gratitude to a sister State, as well 
as duty to the Continent at large, conspire in calling 
on our eastern neighbours to step forth on this occasion, and more especially as they only are in a situation totally to destroy <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s army, by 
intercepting his supplies, and even cutting off his retreat to the Lakes. 
</p><p>
The detachment of eight hundred and ten for this 
garrison and <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> is not yet completed, owing 
to the body of the militia being so suddenly called 
out, but will be effected immediately on their return 
home ; till which time I will endeavour to detain an 
equal number of them here. 
</p><p>
I have not yet received the late resolves of congress for recruiting the army, alluded to in your Excellency's letter of the 4th instant. As soon as they 
come to hand, I will do every thing in my power 
to render them effectual, and forward the requested 
information. I am, with much esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
