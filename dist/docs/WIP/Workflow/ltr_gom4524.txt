Madam, 
</p><p>
If this letter ever reaches you, I shall be obliged for the 
favor to his Excellency, the Baron de Thugut, and I shall expect from his kindness to have your answer forwarded to me. 
The Marchioness de Montagu informed me, by a letter dated 
November twenty-seventh, that you had been forbidden to 
leave the prison, unless you would entirely abandon the intention of returning thither, and that, under this alternative, preferring the duty of a tender and faithful wife to the care of 
your own safety, you have given that decision, which those 
who knew the purity of your mind would naturally expect 
from you. Madame de Montagu adds, that you are not permitted to come here for the purpose of consulting a physician, 
although the state of your health imperiously requires it. 
</p><p>
It is certainly unnecessary for me, Madam, to express here 
the interest, which I take in your fate, and in that of your unfortunate friend, and to tell you how happy I should be, could 
I procure for him his liberty. Reasons, which I do not know, 
and which I nevertheless feel bound to respect, prevent this. 
But we are far from believing here, that his prison has any other 
disagreeable things about it, than those which are unavoidably 
connected with confinement. I am assured, on the contrary, that he is very well lodged, and in want of nothing ; that the 
vigilant exactness, with which he is guarded, arises only from the necessity of using all 'means to prevent his escape ; that, 
far from entertaining the barbarous idea of depriving you of the assistance of art, the physician of your choice will be sent to 
you ; and that, if you are forbidden to come to Vienna, and then return to Olmutz, it is because circumstances require, that 
the rules of an exact prudence should be followed. 
</p><p>
You must not despair, Madam; time will give liberty to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> ; but, in the mean time, if he has been 
ill treated, as Madame de Montagu lias been induced to believe, it is important that it may be known, in order that means 
may be taken to prevent it ; and in case he experiences, in accordance with the benevolent intentions of his Majesty, gentle 
and humane treatment, it seems to me equally proper to ascertain it, in order to put a stop to odious reports, which cannot but exasperate, and which consequently might postpone 
the moment of his liberation. To this effect, have the goodness, Madam, I entreat you, to send me your answer open, 
under cover to his Excellency, the Baron de Thugut. I am 
still uncertain whether I shall be able to receive it at Vienna, 
as it is my intention to depart in a few days. But I flatter 
myself, that we shall meet again in America ; and I pray you 
to believe, that I shall always and everywhere preserve the sincere attachment, with which I have the honor to be, &c.
