MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I am again safe arrived in this city, after an absence 
of five weeks. By the last vessels, I wrote some of 
my friends that I was going to visit Holland. That 
I had a desire to see that country you will not 
wonder at, as one of those theatres, upon which my 
partner and fellow-traveller had exhibited some of 
his most important actions, and rendered to his 
country lasting blessings. It has been the policy of 
some of our allies to keep, as much as possible, 
these events out of sight, and of some of our countrymen to lessen their value in the eyes of mankind. 
I have seen two Histories of the American war, 
written in French, and one lately published in English by a Mr. Andrews. In one of them, no notice 
is taken, or mention made, of our alliance with Holland, and the two others mention it as slightly as 
possible ; and our own countrymen set them the 
</p><p>
example. France, to be sure, was the first to acknowledge our independence, and to aid us with 
men and money, and ought always to be first ranked amongst our friends ; but Holland, surely, ought 
not to be totally neglected. From whence have we 
drawn our supplies for these five years past, even to 
pay to France the interest upon her loan, and where 
else could we now look in case of a pressing emergency ? Yet have I observed, in sermons upon 
public occasions, in orations, &c, France is always 
mentioned with great esteem, Holland totally neglected. This is neither policy nor justice. I have 
been led to a more particular reflection upon this 
subject, from my late visit to that country. The 
respect, attention, civility, and politeness, which we 
received from that people, wherever we went, was 
a striking proof, not only of their personal esteem, 
but of the ideas they entertain with respect to the 
revolution which gave birth to their connexion with 
us, and laid, as they say, the foundation for their 
restoration to privileges, which had been wrested 
from them, and which they are now exerting themselves to recover. The spirit of liberty appears to 
be all alive in them ; but whether they will be able 
to accomplish their views, without a scene of blood 
and carnage, is very doubtful. 
</p><p>
As to the country, I do not wonder that Swift 
gave it the name of " Nick Frog," though I do not 
carry the idea so far as some, who insist that the 
people resemble the frog in the shape of their faces 
and the form of their bodies. They appear to 
be a well-fed, well-clothed, contented, happy people. 
Very few objects of wretchedness present themselves to your view, even amidst the immense concourse of people in the city of Amsterdam. They 
have many public institutions which do honor to 
humanity, and to the particular directors of them. 
The money allotted to benevolent purposes is applied solely to the benefit of the charities, instead of 
being wasted and expended in public dinners to the 
guardians of them, which is said to be the case too 
much in this country. The civil government, or 
police, must be well regulated, since rapine, murder, 
and robbery are very seldom found amongst them. 
</p><p>
The Exchange of Amsterdam is a great curiosity. 
As such, they carried me to see it. I was with Mr. 
Van Staphorst ; and, though the crowd of people 
was immense, I met with no difficulty in passing 
through, every person opening a passage for me. 
The Exchange is a large square, surrounded with 
a piazza. Here, from twelve till two o'clock, all 
and every person who has business of any kind 
to transact, meet, sure of finding the person they 
want ; and it is not unusual to see ten thousand 
persons collected at once. I was in a chamber 
above the Exchange ; the buzz from below was 
like the swarming of bees. The most important 
places which I visited, were Rotterdam, Delft, the 
Hague, Leyden, Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Utrecht. 
I went through many other villages and towns ; the 
names I do not recollect. I was eight days at the 
Hague, and visited every village round it, amongst 
which is Scheveling, a place famous for the embarkation of King Charles. From Utrecht I visited 
Zest, a small town belonging wholly to the Moravians, who maintain the same doctrines with the Moravians at <a href='/results.php?city=bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>, in Pennsylvania, but which 
are not the best calculated for fulfilling the great 
command of replenishing the earth. I visited Gouda, and saw the most celebrated paintings upon 
glass which are to be found. These were immense 
windows, reaching from the top to the bottom of a 
very high church, and containing Scripture history. 
Neither the faces nor attitudes had any thing striking ; but the colors, which had stood for near two hundred years, were beautiful beyond imagination. From 
Amsterdam, we made a party one day to Saardam, 
a few hours' sail only. It was their annual fair, and 
I had an opportunity of seeing tne people in their 
holiday suits. This place is famous for being the 
abode of the Czar Peter, whose ship-carpenter's 
shop they still show. At every place of note, I visited the cabinets of paintings and natural history, and 
all the public buildings of distinction, as well as the 
seats of several private gentlemen, and the Prince 
of Orange's house at the Hague, where he holds his 
court during the summer months ; but the difference, 
which subsists between him and the States, occasioned his retreat to Loo. Consequently I had no 
opportunity of being presented to that Court. "W e 
were invited to dine one day at Sir James Harris's, 
the British minister at that Court, who appears a 
very sensible, agreeable man. Lady Harris, who is 
about twenty-four years old, may be ranked with 
the first of English beauties. She was married at 
seventeen, and has four fine children ; but, though 
very pretty, her Ladyship has no dignity in her manners, nor solidity in her deportment. She rather 
seems of the good-humored, giggling class, a 
mere trifler ; at least, I saw nothing to the contrary. I supped at the Marquis de Verac's, the 
French Ambassador's, with about fifty gentlemen 
and ladies. His own lady is dead. He has a daughter-in-law, who usually lives with him, but was now 
absent in France.

Upon the whole, I was much gratified with my 
excursion to a country, which cannot show its like 
again. The whole appearance of it is that of a 
meadow. What are called the dikes, are the roads, 
which, being raised, separate the canals. Upon 
these you ride, through rows of willow trees upon 
each side. Not a hill to be seen. It is all a continued plain, so that trees, meadows, and canals, 
canals, trees, and meadows, are the unvaried scene. 
The houses are all brick, and the streets are paved 
with brick. It is very unusual to see a single square 
of glass broken, or a brick out of place, even in the 
meanest house. They paint every piece of wood 
within and without their houses ; and, what I thought 
not so wholesome, their milk-pails are painted, within and without, and so are their horse-carts ; but it 
is upon a principle of economy. The country is 
exceeding fruitful, and every house has a garden 
spot, plentifully stored with vegetables. The dress 
of all the country people is precisely the same that 
it was two hundred years ago, and has been handed 
down from generation to generation unimpaired. 
You recollect the short petticoats, and long shortgowns, round-eared caps with straight borders, and 
large straw hats, which the German women wore 
when thev first settled at Germantown. Such is 
now the dress of all the lower class of people, who 
do not even attempt to imitate the gentry. I was 
pleased with the trig neatness of the women ; many 
of them wear black tammy aprons, thick quilted 
coats, or russet skirts, and small hoops ; but only 
figure to yourself a child of three or four, dressed 
in the same way. They cut a figure, I assure you. 
Gold ear-rings are universally worn by them, and 
bracelets upon holidays. The dress of the men 
is full as old-fashioned ; but the Court and genteel 
people dress part English and part French. They 
generally speak both the languages, but French 
most. Since their intercourse with America, the 
English language is considered as an essential part 
of education. I would not omit to mention that I 
visited the church at Leyden, in which our forefathers worshipped, when they fled from hierarchical tyranny and persecution. I felt a respect and 
veneration upon entering the doors, like what the 
ancients paid to their Druids. 
</p><p>
Upon my return home, I found that Captain Cushing had arrived in my absence, and a noble 
packet was handed to me by your niece soon after 
I arrived ; but, as we had not seen each other for 
five weeks, we had much to say ; and, in addition to 
that, I had not closed my eyes for two days and 
nights, having had a stormy, boisterous passage of 
three days, attended with no small danger ; and, as I 
had rode seventy-five miles that day, they all voted 
against my opening my letters that night. Mortifying as it was, I submitted, being almost light-headed 
with want of rest, and fatigue. But I rose early the 
next morning and read them all before breakfast ; 
and here let me thank my dear sister for the entertainment hers afforded me ; but, like most of the 
scenes of life, the pleasure was mixed with pain. 
The account of the death of our dear and worthy 
aunt reached me in a letter from cousin W. Smith, 
the week before I went my journey. Although I 
took a final leave of her when I quitted America, 
yet I have been willing to flatter myself with the 
hope that I might be mistaken, and that her life 
would be prolonged beyond my expectations. How 
often has her image appeared to my mind in the 
same form in which she addressed me when I left her 
house. You know how susceptible her heart was 
to every tender impression. She saw how much I 
was distressed, and strove herself for a magnanimity 
that gave to her whole appearance a placid solemnity which spoke more forcibly than words. There 
was a something indescribable, which to me seemed 
angelic, in her whole manner and appearance, that 
most powerfully impressed my mind ; and I could 
not refrain, when I arrived here, from mentioning it 
to Mr. Smith, who, T dare say, will recollect it. Like 
the angel she then appeared, she now really is, 
fitted by a life of piety and benevolence to join her 
kindred spirits. She has left us her example, and 
the memory of her many virtues, to comfort our afflicted hearts. Beloved, regretted, and lamented ! 
She was like a parent to me, and my full heart has 
paid the tributary tears to her memory. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Believe me yours very affectionately, 
</p><p>
A. A.
