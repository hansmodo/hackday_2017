DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It was unnecessary sooner to trouble you with my 
scrawl, as I could give you no information the least 
interesting. I find the people through this Province 
more alive and zealous than my most sanguine expectation. I believe I might have collected ten thousand 
volunteers. I take only four companies with me, and 
Waterbury's regiment, which is so happily situated on 
the frontier. Ward's regiment I have ordered to remain at their respective homes, until they hear further. These Connecticutians are, if possible, more 
eager to go out of their country, than they are to 
return home, when they have been out for any considerable time. 
</p><p>
Inclosed I send yon my letter to the General congress. That of the Provincial Congress of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
to me, with my answer, I hope will have your approbation. 
</p><p>
The Whigs, I mean the stout ones, are, it is said, 
very desirous that a body of troops should march and 
be stationed in their city. The timid ones are averse, 
merely from the spirit of procrastination, which is the 
characteristic of timidity. The letter of the Provincial 
Congress, you will observe, breathes the very essence 
of this spirit. It is wofully hysterical. I conclude I 
shall receive the orders of the General Congress be 
fore, or immediately on,, my arrival; otherwise I should 
not venture to march into the Province, as, by their 
late resolve, every detachment of the Continental 
troops is to be under the direction of the Provincial 
Congress in which they are ; a resolve, I must say 
with submission to their wisdom, fraught with difficulties and evils. It is impossible, having two sovereigns, that any business should be carried on. 
</p><p>
Have you seen the pamphlet, Common Sense? I 
never saw such a masterly, irresistible performance. 
It will, if I mistake not, in concurrence with the 
transcendent folly and wickedness of the ministry, 
give the coup-de-grace to Great Britain. In short, I 
own myself convinced by the arguments, of the necessity of separation. Poor brave Montgomery ! But it 
it is not a time to cry, but to revenge. God bless 
you, my dear General, and crown us with the success 
I am sure we merit, from the goodness of our cause. 
My love to the ladies. I shall write a long letter to 
Gates, when I have time and materials. Adieu. 
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>
