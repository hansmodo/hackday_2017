DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your favor of yesterday, on 
my way from <a href='/results.php?city=bald hill' rel='city'>Bald Hill</a> to this place. I had before 
ordered Parsons's brigade to encamp near Robinson's ; 
Huntington's, near the place where Parsons's encamped 
before they left this place; Patterson's, between that 
place and Danforth's ; Nixon's, at the gorge of the 
mountains. Glover's is not yet arrived. May I be 
permitted to request that, when it does, it may be 
attached to General Howe's division? 
</p><p>
By intelligence received since I had the honor to 
write in the morning, I learn that the enemy's advanced sentinels and videttes were posted, the last 
night, on the New Bridge. They appear to advance 
with the greatest caution. I think Major-General 
Howe was very fortunate in making his retreat the 
instant he did. Had he remained, I think he would 
have been Burgoyned; his intelligence being good, 
he escaped it. I have taken measures to obtain intelligence from every quarter on this side the river. 
Such as I receive shall be transmitted. I have ordered the light-horse to the left, and am determined 
to harass the enemy, if possible. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
