Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . Your remarks in regard to the proposed reduction of the loans at <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a> have been read with great 
attention and interest. Situated as the Bank has been for some time past, its first object was necessarily its own protection, for in its safety the whole ultimate security of the 
currency must be found. This we have striven to accomplish with the least possible pressure on the community and 
thus far the reductions compared with the deposits are so small, that our friends rather reproach us with not having 
done enough, than to have curtailed excessively. The de 
posit Banks being now in full possession of the public revenue may employ it in discounts and leave the Bank of the 
United States the opportunity of gently diminishing its business. That with so wide a circulation as 18 or 19 millions 
which the receipts of the public revenue may place in the hands of officers who know that no service more acceptable 
can be rendered than to employ the funds in injuring the 
Bank, and so many vulnerable points to protect, we shall 
deem it expedient to reduce the present amount of our loans, 
cannot be doubted. The Executive, by removing the public 
revenues has relieved the Bank from all responsibility for the 
currency, and imposed upon it a necessity to look primarily 
to the interest of the Stockholders committed to our charge. 
Our friends must therefore bear with us, if in the midst of 
the present troubles, we should endeavor to strengthen the 
Bank so as to make it able here after to interpose effectively 
for the relief of the Country. . . .
