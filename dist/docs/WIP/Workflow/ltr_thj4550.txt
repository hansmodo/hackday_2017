Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It has long since been observed, that, of the three millions of livres given by the court of France to aid us in the commencement of our revolution, one million was unaccounted for by the 
hands into which it was paid. The date of the payment is 
fixed to have been the 10th of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. But to whom it 
was paid has never been known. Suspicions are, that it was 
to Beaumarchais ; and that with this very money he purchased 
the supplies furnished us by him, for which large sums have 
been paid him already, and a farther large sum. is lately certified to b6 due to him as the balance of that account. I enclose 
you a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury on this subject, 
with all the papers relative to the same, which his office can 
furnish ; and as you are on the spot, I must beg the favor of 
you to make an immediate and thorough investigation of it. 
No reasons of State can now exist for covering the transaction 
longer under mystery. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear 
Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
