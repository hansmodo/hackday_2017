Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to send you herein enclosed, the copy of a 
letter, which has been addressed to me by citizen Postic, a 
lawyer residing at Morlaix. It appears, that in the proceedings of which he has given an account, there are extraordinary irregularities, and I think it my duty to inform you of them, 
as on the justice of tribunals often depends the salvation, and 
always the prosperity of a State. 
</p><p>
I request you at the same time, Sir, to permit me to make 
two general observations on the whole of this business; one of 
which applies to the organization, and the other to the proceedings of the commercial tribunals. The referring of questions on sea prizes to these tribunals, appears to me dangerous, 
since they involve the interpretation of the treaties, and the 
application of the law of nations ; consequently of peace and 
of war. Now we may be permitted to entertain some doubt, 
as to the knowledge of the judges, and we ought besides to 
fear, lest they may be interested, as owners of privateers, in 
the questions which are submitted to them. 
But whatever may be the organization of the tribunals, it 
appears to me essential, Sir, that in their proceedings they 
should receive all the claims which may be made to them ; 
that they should even invite, without waiting for the authority 
of the persons interested, who are often at the distance of one 
thousand leagues. The jurisdiction of the tribunals, within 
whose cognizance are the questions of prize, is in rem. They 
take possession of the thing, and by that means render them 
selves responsible for it. Now as the tribunals, which are the 
depository of the thing, ought not to dispossess themselves of 
it, without a formal authoritative act of the true proprietor, it is 
their duty, not only to admit, but also to seek proofs, which 
may establish to whom the property truly belongs. This is a 
double duty, towards the neutral proprietor, and towards their 
own nation ; for every government, which permits its citizens 
to fit out privateers, arms with the destructive sword of war, 
hands which are interested to extend its ravages, and renders 
itself responsible for the abuses, which result from so dangerous a delegation of sovereignty. For the purpose of repressing them, the Admiralty tribunals have been established 
throughout the different nations of Europe. In these tribunals, 
the government furnishes the means of information, by the facility with which it admits therein every species of claim. It 
preserves, by appeals, the right of deciding in the last resort 
on the contests which therein arise ; and it gives the necessary 
time to enlighten its conscience on thorny questions, before 
the pronouncing of a sentence, which might extend or prolong 
the horrors of war. 
</p><p>
These, Sir, are the reflections which experience has dicta 
ted to me. They daily make on me a more lively impression, 
on account of the claims addressed to me by my countrymen, 
of which I have communicated to you but a very small part. 
I always send to the tribunals the injured persons, by giving 
them the most positive assurances, that they will there obtain 
complete and prompt justice. I have the honor to be, &c.
