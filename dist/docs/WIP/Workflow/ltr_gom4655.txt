Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you have copies of <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun's</a> letters to me of 
the twenty-sixth of March, mine to him of the twenty-eighth, 
and his to me of the twenty-ninth. I also enclose under this 
cover the journal of the debates and decrees. These will 
give you the present state of our news up to the last even 
ing. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, that all my conjectures respecting the 
army of Dumouriez are more than realized. From the 
letters of Custine you will perceive that he has been totally 
defeated, for he found it necessary to fall back about forty 
miles, leaving a garrison in Mayence, which must fall of course, 
and we may hourly expect to hear of farther misfortunes in 
that quarter. Perhaps the Prussian army may stop to besiege 
Mayence, but I think a part of their force will be sufficient 
for that purpose. The country, as I have mentioned in a 
former letter, is universally indisposed to France, and I can 
say on good information the same thing of Savoy. 
</p><p>
It is now very fine weather in this city, and if the season 
be proportionably advanced in other quarters, the campaign 
will be soon opened on every side. There will be a great 
want of bread before we have another harvest, unless peace 
should take place. If Lisle and Valenciennes should surrender at once, the campaign in that quarter will not be so much 
advanced as might be apprehended, because as yet the m aga-zines are not brought up, and time must be allowed for that 
purpose. 
</p><p>
It seems indeed probable, that the enemy have taken considerable magazines belonging to France, but even these are 
at some distance. I expect every hour to hear of an attempt 
upon Givet or Maubeuge, and it would seem from the best in 
formation to be had, that neither of these places can be defend-ed long. In short, on every side, the horizon looks darkly. 
Whether Dumouriez will be able to lead his army against Pa 
ris, seems as yet uncertain. Perhaps he may experience a 
similar fate to that of Lafayette, but he is in much better circumstances for a high game, and much abler to play it. At 
any rate, the enemy derive advantage from the squabble between him and the Convention. Here they are not yet fully 
apprised of their danger. Like those who die of a hectic, 
hope gleams to the last, and the latest breath is spent in expression of some splendid fancy. In the expiring struggles, 
however, let them happen when they may, we shall experience new horrors. Such, at least, is the probable chance. 
</p><p>
The constant complaints on account of the capture of Ame 
rican vessels, and the necessity of giving protection to such of 
our countrymen, as are here, have prevented me hitherto 
from leaving Paris. At present, the barriers are strictly guard 
ed, and those who have applied lately for passports have been 
disappointed ; but in a few days we shall know something 
more upon this subject. The ministry seem to be in a fair way 
towards an entire dissolution. In short, everything here is in 
almost as much confusion as on the frontiers. I am, &tc.
