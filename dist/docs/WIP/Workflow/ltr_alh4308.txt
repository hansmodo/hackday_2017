Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving your letter of the 
10th instant, by the last post. It is certainly very 
possible, that motives different from the one avowed, 
may have produced a certain communication ; and in 
matters of such a nature, it is not only allowable, 
but the dictate of prudence, to receive suggestions 
with peculiar caution. 
</p><p>
A British packet arrived yesterday. The accounts 
she brings are all of a warlike aspect. I have extracted from an English paper the inclosed decree of 
the National Assembly of France, which, though of a 
qualified tenor, looks pretty directly towards the 
eventual supporting of Spain. The English papers 
hold it up as a decisive indication of a disposition to 
do so. And it is said, in some of the letters which 
have been received, that positive orders have been 
sent to Lord Howe to fight, if he can find an opportunity. The papers announce a second fleet of fifteen 
sail of the line, ready to rendezvous at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, 
to be under the command of Admiral Hood; their 
destination unknown. It is also mentioned, that the 
Dutch fleet had returned to the Texel, the Duke of 
Leeds having previously made a journey for an interview with the Dutch Admiral. This very mysterious circumstance is wholly unexplained.

A certain gentleman, who called on me to-day, informed me that a packet had sailed the 16th of August for <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, in which went passenger General Clarke. He added, that the rumor in England was, 
that Sir Guy Carleton was to return in her. He 
made no other communication. 
</p><p>
The inclosed letter came to hand this day. I have 
had no opportunity of making any inquiry concerning the person recommended in it. If I can obtain 
any additional lights, they shall be made known without delay. The object suggested in your letter, as 
preparatory to the meeting of the Legislature, shall 
engage my particular attention. The papers of the 
Departments of State and the Treasury, and of the 
Commissioners for settling Accounts, are on their way 
to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. On the 20th, I propose, with my 
family, to set out for the same place. I have the 
honor to be, with the highest respect and truest attachment. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>.
