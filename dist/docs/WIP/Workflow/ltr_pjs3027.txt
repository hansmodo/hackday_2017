DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to congratulate your Excellency 
on a signal victory gained by General Stark over a 
detachment of about fifteen hundred of the enemy 
near Bennington, on the 16th instant, an account 
whereof I have this moment received in a letter from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a></a>, of which the following is a copy. 
</p><p>
"Bennington, August 18th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777" rel="origin">1777</a>. Dear General, 
the late signal success of a body of about two thou 
sand troops, mostly militia, under the command of 
Brigadier-General Stark, in this part of the country, 
on the 16th instant, over a party of about fifteen 
hundred of the enemy, who came out with a manifest design to possess themselves of this town, as 
will appear by the inclosed, is an event happy and 
important. Our troops behaved in a very brave and 
heroic manner. They pushed the enemy from one 
work to another, thrown up on advantageous ground, 
and from different posts, with spirit and fortitude, 
until they gained a complete victory over them. 
</p><p>
" The following is the best list I have been able 
to obtain of the prisoners, their killed and wounded, 
namely : One Lieutenant-Colonel, one Major, five Captains, twelve Lieutenants, four Ensigns, two Cornets, 
one Judge-Advocate, one Baron, two Canadian officers, 
and three Surgeons, thirty-seven British soldiers, three 
hundred and ninety-eight Hessians, thirty-eight Canadians, and one hundred and fifty-one Tories taken. 
The number of wounded fallen into our hands, Exclusive of the above, is about eighty. The number of their slain has not yet been ascertained, as they 
fought on the retreat for several miles in a wood, 
hut supposed to he about two hundred. Their artillery, which consisted of four brass field-pieces, with a 
considerable quantity of baggage, likewise fell into 
our hands. We have heard nothing of Burgoyne, or 
his army, for these two days past. The prisoners 
have been sent into the State of Massachusetts Bay, 
except the Tories. Shall wait your direction respecting  them, as most of them belong to the State of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. We have now about two thousand at or 
near this place.

" I am, dear General, with regard and esteem, 
"Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
" BENJAMIN LINCOLN." 
</p><p>
"N. B. We had about twenty or thirty killed in 
the action, and perhaps fifty wounded." 
</p><p>
I also inclose copy of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'><a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s</a> orders to Lieutenant-Colonel Baum, which were transmitted to me with the above. 
</p><p>
I have great hopes that we shall soon have the satisfaction of learning, that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> has raised the siege of Fort Schuyler. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, I am 
informed, arrived last night at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. I am, dear Sir, with the most respectful sentiments, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
