DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 26th ultimo I had 
the honor to receive on the 3d instant. 
</p><p>
I have long since signified to Congress the necessity of a delegation from them to this place ; and in 
their last to me, of the 12th ultimo, they (unfortunately for me) say that it did not appear necessary 
then. I took the liberty to lament, that they were not in sentiment with me on the subject, and to add 
that I thought it absolutely necessary that one should be sent, so that I hope soon to see some of the gentlemen here. A variety of regulations are necessary 
to be made in this quarter; a task to which I feel 
myself greatly inadequate, but which, if I had even 
judgment enough to arrange with propriety, the shattered condition of my constitution is such, that matters so momentous as these should not be left to so 
precarious an event as that of my being able to sup 
port the fatigue ; for <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a>, though 
endowed with shining abilities, will have his time 
so totally engrossed with other matters, that he will 
not be able to attend to these. 
</p><p>
Should success crown our endeavours at St. John's, 
of which there seems to be little doubt, the entire 
reduction of Canada will, in all probability, be the 
consequence; an event which will open new scenes. 
An army to be formed and properly disposed of in 
that quarter - y provisions, ammunition, and every necessary to be procured for it; preparations to be made for the next campaign; proper places to be 
determined on, and fortifications to be erected, to 
defend that Province against any attacks that may 
be made on it in the ensuing year ; small craft to 
be constructed here, that a reenforcement may be 
speedily sent into Canada, in case it should be 
found necessary to support what troops may be stationed there ; galleys, carrying heavy artillery, to 
prevent vessels of force from coming up the St. 
Lawrence ; a mode of government to be adopted in 
a country, where all will be anarchy and confusion 
without it; and probably a variety of other interesting regulations to take place, that do not just now occur to me. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will do me the justice to believe that I feel, in the most sensible manner, the favorable opinion you are pleased to entertain of 
me ; and I am confident <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> will not be less affected on what you observe of him. I do myself the pleasure, this day, to write that 
gentleman, and shall convey to him your best wishes and respects. 
</p><p>
The vast benefit that would result from a successful conclusion of the campaign in this quarter, 
has been so deeply impressed upon me, that I have often regretted that the operations were not commenced at an earlier period, and, when commenced, 
that so much tardiness prevailed in sending up the necessary stores and troops. That you, my dear General, should feel an anxiety to induce you to ask 
those questions, which you have done in so polite and friendly a manner, is what I can easily suppose. 
</p><p>
The difficulties, under which <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> has labored, have been in the extreme, and which he 
most pathetically laments in a letter to me of the 13th ultimo, an extract of which I do myself the 
honor to inclose your Excellency, together with the 
opinion of a Council of War held on that day, and 
which I forgot to transmit you in the hurry with 
which I sent off my last. And in his letter of the 
23d ultimo he says ; " Our reinforcements not yet 
arrived ; at this instant I have not in my camp 
above seven hundred and fifty men, and I wish much 
to send a strong detachment to the Island of Montreal " ; a manoeuvre which would have taken place sooner, had it been in his power, or been prudent to 
have gone into ; neither of which I think it was, and 
shall beg leave to make the following observations in 
support of this opinion. 
</p><p>
At no period, until this, has it appeared to me 
that it would have been prudent to have passed St. 
John s, although a sufficient force could have been 
left for forming a blockade ; for [it would have been 
hazardous] previous to the reduction of Chamblee, and 
the success of our troops in repulsing the attack of 
Monsieur Regouville, who was sent from Montreal 
with two hundred and forty men, and expected to 
be joined by the inhabitants of three of the most 
populous parishes on the south side of the St. Lawrence, in which he was disappointed to a man, and 
which has in some measure evinced the temper of the 
Canadians towards us, and given us better assurances 
than any we have had of their friendly disposition, 
for until then their real sentiments were problematical ; and about this time, too, we sunk their best 
armed vessel, so that we can now spare more men for 
an attack upon Montreal, which, if not prevented by 
other obstacles, was <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a>'s intention, 
as soon as the reenforcement above alluded to should 
arrive, which took place on the 26th or 27th, and 
consisted of <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a> s, of three hundred and 
thirty-five, and Major Tuthill, of Colonel Holmes s, 
with two hundred and twenty-five, officers of both 
included. In the numbers, however, he will be Disappointed, as <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a> had returned four 
hundred and eighty-four effectives from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, but 
discharged ninety-nine between this and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and 
left fifty-one sick here ; and the others, too, fell greatly 
short of what I expected 
</p><p>
If a blockade had been formed before the above-mentioned events took place, it must have been sufficiently strong, not only to have guarded against the 
danger of a sortie, but to have prevented the enemy's armed vessels, which greatly surpassed ours in 
strength, from getting to the southward of us, and 
thereby effectually cutting off every possibility of retreat ; which, if they had been able to accomplish, 
the Canadians, I do firmly believe, would immediately 
have joined Mr. Carleton. But if a sufficient body 
had been left, that to -make the attempt on Montreal 
would have been too weak for such a service ; and 
if they had met with a repulse, the Canadians, in 
that case, would not have hesitated one moment to 
have acted against us, (as Colonel Allen, in his report to me, observes,) and all our hopes in Canada 
would have been at an end. But another difficulty 
presented itself, and which I do not know how the 
detachment which <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> proposed to 
send, or has sent, will even now surmount, the want 
of craft to convey a body of troops, sufficient to promise success, to the Island of Montreal, across the 
St. Lawrence, (which is deep, rapid, and wide,) as 
no craft can pass the fort at St. John's to go down 
the Sorel; which obstacles would be immediately removed on the reduction of that fortress, which I hope has taken place by this time, and then I shall have 
the fullest confidence that our labors will be at an end in this quarter, except from what difficulties may arise 
from the intemperate desire our people have to return to their habitations; my fears on which account I have expressed to Congress. 
</p><p>
If we had passed it wholly, and could have got to and succeeded against Montreal, St. John's would undoubtedly have fallen. But what a vast risk ! No less than that of the loss of the whole Army, the command of Lake Champlain, <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and Crown 
Point ; for no retreat could possibly have taken place ; the dependence on the Canadians uncertain. And if they had found us incapable of passing to Montreal 
for want of boats, or of retreating on the same ac count, it is certain we should have found them opposed to us. 
</p><p>
In this view of things, I hope it will be thought that either attempt would have been injudicious. 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose you sundry Extracts of my letters to Congress, with extracts of 
their answers, by which your Excellency will perceive that I have hinted at several things, which I 
conceived claimed the attention of Congress. I in 
close you, also, a list of the officers made prisoners 
at St. John's. The return of the non-commissioned 
officers and privates is either mislaid or by mistake 
inclosed to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a></a>. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to assure the gentlemen of your 
family that they have my best wishes. I have the 
honor to be your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
