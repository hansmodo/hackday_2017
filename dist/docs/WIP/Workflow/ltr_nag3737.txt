Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 18th came to hand 
this afternoon. I had given over the thoughts of going home, even if I obtained your permission, before 
I received your pleasure upon the subject. My affairs require it ; but I am fully convinced that the 
time it will take, and the state of the Southern department, will not admit of the indulgence. When I 
marched from Toppan, I wrote to Mrs. Greene to 
come to camp, and expect her here every hour. 
Should I set out before her arrival, the disappointment of not seeing me, added to the shock of my 
going to the southward, I am very apprehensive will 
have some disagreeable effect upon her health, especially as her apprehensions have been all alive respecting my going to the southward, before there was 
the least probability of it. 
</p><p>
My baggage sets out in the morning, if Colonel Hughes does not disappoint me about the horses; and my stay shall not be more than a day longer, 
whether INIrs. Greene arrives or not. Your Excellency cannot be more anxious to have me come on, than 
I am to comply with your orders, especially since 
the two last articles of intelligence, the sailing of the 
troops at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and the advance of Lord Cornwallis into the State of North Carolina. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
