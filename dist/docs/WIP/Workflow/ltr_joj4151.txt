Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I was this morning favoured with yours of the 27th inst. 
I regret the circumstances which prevented our seeing each 
other when you were here. There are several topics on 
which I wish to converse with you, and particularly 
respecting military arrangements at New-York. The rifle 
corps, and a few of the new light-infantry companies are 
established. There were reasons which I shall mention 
when we meet, which induced me to suspend a decision 
relative to the others for the present. The objections stated 
in the petition are not, in my judgment, conclusive. So 
soon as the commissions advised by the council are despatched, I propose to set out for New- York. The defence 
of the port, &c., in my opinion, should be under your direction. The measures will be concerted between us. The 
council will meet again before the session, and all such new 
corps as ought to be established, will then without difficulty 
be organized ultimately. I think with you on the subject 
of resignations. 
</p><p>
It is with me a question whether any person convicted 
of forgery ought to be pardoned at present, when offences 
of that kind abound. As yet I have not pardoned any 
convicts of that description, except in cases where the convictions turned on a balance of evidence, and where guilt 
w T as probable, but not certain. Mr. Murray has just been 
with me on this subject. I shall take it into further consideration, but fear the objections will prove insuperable. 
The young man's father and family are to be pitied, but the 
power to pardon is a trust to be exercised on principles of 
sound discretion, combining policy, justice, and humanity ; 
â€” we will talk this matter over. I have an idea of puttkig 
the light corps into a regiment, and making our friend Troup colonel of it. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely,
