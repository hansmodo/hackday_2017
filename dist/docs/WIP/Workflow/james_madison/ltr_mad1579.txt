DEAR SIR, The privilege of franking having ceased with 
the Convention, I have waited for this opportunity of inclosing 
you a copy of the proposed Constitution for the United States. 
I forbear to make any observ.ions on it, either on the side of 
its merits or its faults. The best judges of both will be those 
who can combine with a knowledge of the collective and permanent interest of America a freedom from the bias resulting 
from a participation in the work. If the plan proposed be 
worthy of adoptjon, the degree of unanimity attained in the 
Convention is a circumstance as fortunate as the very respectable dissent on the part of Virginia is a subject of regret. The 
double object of blending a proper stability and energy in the 
Government with the essential characters of the republican 
form, and of tracing a proper line of demarkation between the 
national and State authorities, was necessarily found to be as 
difficult as it was desirable, and to admit of an infinite diversity concerning the means among those who were unanimously 
agreed concerning the end. 
</p><p>
I find, by a letter from my father, that he and my uncle Erasmus have lately paid their respects to Edmundsbury. I infer 
from his silence as to your health that no unfavorable change 
had happened in it. That this may find it perfectly re-established is the sincere and affectionate wish of, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, your friend and humble serv.
