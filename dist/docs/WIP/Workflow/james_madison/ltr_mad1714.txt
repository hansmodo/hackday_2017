DEAR SIR, As you find an amusement in our newspapers, I 
inclose two of the last; which, however, contain little of consequence, except a new Report from the Treasury Department. 
The mover of the reference which gave birth to it declared he 
did not mean to authorize a proposition of new taxes, and it 
appeared that some at least voted for the motion on that idea. 
You will find, however, that a different construction has been 
made by the head of that Department. Quere: Is not a tax on 
horses a direct tax, and therefore unconstitutional in the form 
proposed? Quere: How much will Virginia pay more than her 
share of such a tax compared with Connecticut, and the Southern States, generally, than the Eastern? Quere: Is it not rather 
hard that those who are to have least of the benefit should constantly be saddled with most of the burden? Quere: If a new 
tax and a direct tax is to be encountered, is it not mockery to 
begin with one that is to raise forty odd thousand dollars only 
as a fund for sinking the debt? Quere but there would be no 
end to the Queries arising out of the project. 
Yours affectionately.
