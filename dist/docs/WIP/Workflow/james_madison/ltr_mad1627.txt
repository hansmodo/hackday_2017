TO G. L. TURBERVILLE. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, November 2d, <a href="/results.php?year=1788">1788</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 20th ultimo not having got 
into my hands in time to be acknowledged by the last mail, I 
have now the additional pleasure of acknowledging along with 
it your favor of the 24, which I received yesterday. 
</p><p>
You wish to know my sentiments on the project of another 
general Convention, as suggested by <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. I shall give 
them to you with great frankness, though I am aware they may 
not coincide with those in fashion at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, or even with 
your own. I am not of the number, if there be any such, who 
think the Constitution lately adopted a faultless work. On 
the contrary, there are amendments which I wished it to have 
received before it issued from the place in which it was formed. 
These amendments I still think ought to be made, according to 
the apparent sense of America; and some of them, at least, I 
presume will be made. There are others concerning which 
doubts are entertained by many, and which have both advocates 
and opponents on each side of the main question. These, I 
think, ought to receive the light of actual experiment before it 
would be prudent to admit them into the Constitution. With 
respect to the first class, the only question is, which of the two 
modes provided be most eligible for the discussion and adoption of them. 
</p><p>
The objections against a Convention which give a preference 
to the other mode, in my judgment, are the following: 1. It will 
add to the difference among the States on the merits another 
and an unnecessary difference concerning the mode. There are 
amendments which, in themselves, will probably be agreed to 
by all the States, and pretty certainly by the requisite proportion of them. If they be contended for in the mode of a Convention, there are unquestionably a number of States who will 
be so averse and apprehensive as to the mode, that they will 
reject the merits rather than agree to the mode. A Convention, therefore, does not appear to be the most convenient or 
probable channel for getting to the object. 2. A Convention 
cannot be called without the unanimous consent of the parties 
who are to be bound by it, if first principles are to be recurred 
to; or without the previous application of two-thirds of the 
State Legislatures, if the forms of the Constitution are to be 
pursued. The difficulties in either of these cases must evidently 
be much greater than will attend the origination of amendments 
in Congress, which may be done at the instance of a single 
State Legislature, or even without a single instruction on the 
subject. 3. If a general Convention were to take place for the 
avowed and sole purpose of revising the Constitution, it would 
naturally consider itself as having a greater latitude than the 
Congress appointed to administer and support as well as to 
amend the system; it would consequently give greater agitation 
to the public mind; an election into it would be courted by the 
most violent partizans on both sides; it would probably consist 
of the most heterogeneous characters; would be the very focus 
of that flame which lias already too much heated men of all 
parties; would no doubt contain individuals of insidious views, 
who, under the mask of seeking alterations popular in some 
parts but inadmissible in other parts of the Union, might have 
a dangerous opportunity of sapping the very foundations of the 
fabric. Under all these circumstances, it seems scarcely to be 
presumable that the deliberations of the body could be conducted in harmony, or terminate in the general good. Having 
witnessed the difficulties and dangers experienced by the first 
Convention, which assembled under every propitious circumstance, I should tremble for the result of a second, meeting in 
the present temper of America, and under all the disadvantages 
I have mentioned. 4. It is not unworthy of consideration that 
the prospect of a second Convention would be viewed by all 
Europe as a dark and threatening cloud hanging over the Constitution just established, and, perhaps, over the Union itself; 
and would therefore suspend, at least, the advantages this great 
event has promised us on that side. It is a well-known fact 
that this event has filled that quarter of the Globe with equal 
wonder and veneration; that its influence is already secretly but 
powerfully working in favor of liberty in France; and it is fairly 
to be inferred that the final event there may be materially affected by the prospect of things here. We are not sufficiently 
sensible of the importance of the example which this Country 
may give to the World, nor sufficiently attentive to the advantages we may reap from the late reform, if we avoid bringing it 
into danger. The last loan in Holland, and that alone, saved 
the United States from Bankruptcy in Europe; and that loan 
was obtained from a belief that the Constitution then depending 
would be certainly, speedily, quietly, and finally established, 
and by that means put America into a permanent capacity to 
discharge with honor and punctuality all her engagements.
