DEAR SIR, I have deferred writing since my arrival here in 
the hourly hope of being enabled to communicate the final news 
from Poughkeepsie. By a letter from Hamilton, dated the day 
before yesterday, I find that it is equally uncertain when the 
business will be closed, and what will be its definitive form. 
The inclosed gazette states the form which the depending proposition bears. It is not a little strange that the anti-federal 
party should be reduced to such an expedient, and yet be able 
to keep their numbers together in the opposition. Nor is it 
less strange that the other party, as appears to be the case, 
should hesitate in deciding that the expedient as effectually 
keeps the State, for the present, out of the new union as the most 
unqualified rejection could do. The intelligent citizens see 
clearly that this would be its operation, and are agitated by the 
double motives of federalism and a zeal to give this City a fair 
chance for the first meeting of the new Government. 
</p><p>
Congress have deliberated in part on the arrangements for 
putting the new machine into operation, but have concluded on 
nothing but the times for choosing electors, <fec. Those who 
wish to make <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> the place of meeting studiously promote delay. Others who are not swayed by this consideration 
do not urge dispatch. They think it would be well to let as 
many States as possible have an opportunity of deciding on the 
Constitution; and what is of more consequence, they wish to 
give opportunities, where they can take place, for as many elections of State Legislatures as can precede a reasonable time for 
making the appointments and arrangements referred to them. 
If there be too great an interval between the acts of Congress 
on this subject and the next election or next meeting of a State 
Legislature, it may afford a pretext for an intermediate summoning of the existing members, who are everywhere less federal than their successors hereafter to be elected will probably 
be. This is particularly the case in Maryland, where the antifederal temper of the Executive would render an intermediate 
and extraordinary meeting of the Assembly of that State the 
more likely to be called. On my way thro' Maryland I found 
such an event to be much feared by the friends, and wished by 
the adversaries, of the Constitution. We have no late news 
from Europe, nor anything from North Carolina. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of esteem and attachment, I remain, D'r 
Sir, your obed.  and affect, serv. .
