TO WILLIAM BRADFORD, ESQ. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> COUNTY, VIRGINIA, 6th Sept., <a href="/results.php?year=1773">1773</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, If I did not love you too well to scold at you, I 
should begin this with upbraiding your silence, contrary to 
your express promise and my earnest solicitations. The bundle 
of pamphlets you sent by the post has miscarried, or I would 
not trouble you with sending them again; but perhaps if you 
would inquire of the posts, they might still be discovered. 
</p><p>
I expect this will be handed to you by Mr. Erwin, who has 
been kind enough to extend his journey this far, whose praise 
is in every man's mouth here for an excellent discourse he this 
day preached for us. He will let you know everything that 
occurs to me worth mentioning at commencement, or <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, if you should not attend the commencement. Gratitude 
to him, and friendship to yourself and others, with some business, perhaps, will induce me to visit <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> or <a href="/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">PRINCETON</a> 
in the spring, if I should be alive, and should have health 
sufficient. ' 
</p><p>
I set too high a value on Mr. Erwin's company to write 
much to you now, and besides have the like office of friendship 
to several other friends. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, yours most affectionately. 
</p>
