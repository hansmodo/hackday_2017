DEAR SIR, Supposing that you will be at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> by the 
time this reaches it, I drop a few lines for the post of to-day. 
Mr. Jones tells me he informed you that a substitute had been 
brought forward to the commercial propositions which you left 
on the carpet. The subject has not since been called up. If 
any change has taken place in the mind of the House, it has not 
been unfavorable to the idea of confiding to Congress a power 
over trade. I am far from thinking, however, that a perpetual 
power can be made palatable at this time. It is more probable 
that the other idea of a Convention of Commissioners to <a href="/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>, from the States, for deliberating on the state of commerce and the degree of power which ought to be lodged in 
Congress, will be attempted. Should it fail in the House, it is 
possible that a revival of the printed propositions, with an extension of their term to twenty-five years, will be thought on 
by those who contend that something of a general nature ought 
to be done. My own opinion is unaltered. The propositions 
for a State effort have passed, and a bill is ordered in, but the 
passage of the bill will be a work of difficulty and uncertainty; 
many having acquiesced in the preliminary stages who will 
strenuously oppose the measure in its last stages. 
</p><p>
No decisive vote has been yet taken on the assize bill. I 
conceive it to be in some danger, but that the chance is in its 
favour. The case of the British debts will be introduced in a 
day or two. We have got through more than half of the Revisal. The criminal bill has been assailed on all sides. Mr. 
Mercer has proclaimed unceasing hostility against it. Some 
alterations have been made, and others probably will be made, 
but I think the main principle of it will finally triumph over all 
opposition. I had hoped that this session would have finished 
the code, but a vote against postponing the further consideration of it till the next was carried by so small a majority, that 
I perceive it will be necessary to contend for nothing more 
than a few of the more important bills, leaving the residue of 
them for another year. 
</p><p>
My proposed amendment to the report on the Memorial of 
Kentucky was agreed to in a Committee of the whole without 
alteration, and with very few dissents. It lies on the table for 
the ratification of the House. The members from that district 
have become extremely cold on the subject of an immediate separation. The half tax is postponed till March, and the September tax till November next. Not a word has passed in the 
House as to a paper emission. I wish to hear from you on your 
arrival at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and to receive, in particular, whatever 
you may be at liberty to disclose with regard to the Treaty of 
peace, &c., with Great Britain.
