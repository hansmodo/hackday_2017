DEAR SIR, I am just favored with yours of the 7th instant, 
and will attend to your wishes as to the political essays in the 
press. 
</p><p>
I have given notice to my friends in <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> that the County 
may command my services in the Convention if it pleases. I 
can say with great truth, however, that in this overture I sacrifice every private inclination to considerations not of a selfish 
nature. I foresee that the undertaking will involve me in very 
laborious and irksome discussions; that public opposition to 
several very respectable characters, whose esteem and friendship I greatly prize, may unintentionally endanger the subsisting connection; and that disagreeable misconstructions, of 
which samples have been already given, may be the fruit of 
those exertions which fidelity will impose. But I have made 
up my determination on the subject; and if I am informed that 
my presence at the election in the County be indispensable, 
shall submit to that condition also ; although it is my particular 
wish to decline it, as well to avoid apparent solicitude on the 
occasion as a journey of such length at a very unpleasant season.

I had seen the extract of your letter to Col. Carter, and had 
supposed, from the place where it first made its appearance, 
that its publication was the effect of the zeal of a correspondent. I cannot but think, on the whole, that it may have been 
of service, notwithstanding the scandalous misinterpretations 
of it which have been attempted. As it has evidently the air 
of a paragraph to a familiar friend, the omission of an argumentative support of the opinion given will appear to no candid 
reader unnatural or improper.

We have no late information from Europe except through 
the English papers, which represent the affairs of France as in 
the most ticklish state. The facts have every appearance of 
authenticity, and we wait with great impatience for the packet 
which is daily expected. It can be little doubted that the patriots have been abandoned, whether from impotency in France, 
misconduct in them, or from what other cause, is not altogether 
clear. The French apologists are visibly embarrassed by the 
dilemma of submitting to the appearance of either weakness or 
the want of faith. They seem generally to allege that their engagements being with the Republic, the nation could not oppose 
the regular authority of the country by supporting a single 
province, or, perhaps, a party in it only. The validity of this 
excuse will depend much on the real connection between France 
and the patriots, and the assurances given as an encouragement 
to the latter. From the British King's speech, it would seem 
that France had avowed her purpose of supporting her Dutch 
friends, though it is possible her menaces to England might be 
carried further than her real promises to the patriots. All 
these circumstances, however, must have galled the pride of 
France, and I have little doubt that a war will prove it as soon 
as her condition will admit of it; perhaps she may be the sooner 
forced into it on account of her being in a contrary situation.

I hear nothing yet from the Convention of New Hampshire.
