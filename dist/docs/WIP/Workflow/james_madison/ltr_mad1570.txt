DEAR SIR, The vigorous measures finally pursued by the 
Government of Massachusetts against the insurgents had the 
intended effect of dispersing them. By some it was feared that 
they would re-embody on the return of favorable weather. As 
yet, no symptom of such a design has appeared. It would seem 
that they mean to try their strength in another way ; that is, 
by endeavoring to give the elections such a turn as may promote their views under the auspices of Constitutional forms. 
How far they may succeed is not yet reducible to. certainty. 
That a great change will be effected in the component members 
of the Government is certain, but the degree of influence imputable to the malcontents cannot be well known till some 
specimen shall be given of the temper of the new rulers. A 
great proportion of the Senate is changed, and a greater proportion of the other branch it is expected will be changed. A 
paper emission, at least, is apprehended from this revolution in 
their councils. 
</p><p>
Considerable changes are taking place, I hear, in the County 
elections in Virginia, and a strong itch beginning to return for 
paper money. <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> is said to have the measure in contemplation, and to be laying his train for it already. He will, 
however, be powerfully opposed by Col. Mason, if he should be 
elected and be able to serv.; by Monroe, Marshall, and Ludwell Lee, (son of <a href='/results.php?tla=rhl' rel='co-worker'>R. H. Lee</a>,) who are already elected ; and 
sundry others of inferior rank. <a href='/results.php?tla=beh' rel='colleague'>Mr. Harrison</a>, the late Governor, has so far regained the favor of Charles City as to be reinstated a representative. The part which he will take is uncertain. From his repeated declarations he ought to be adverse 
to a paper emission.
