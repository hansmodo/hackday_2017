TO JOHN BROWN, (KENTUCKY.)

<a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>, August 23, <a href="/results.php?year=1785">1785</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your favour of the 12th of July was safely delivered to me by Mr. Craig. I accept with pleasure your proposed exchange of Western for Eastern intelligence, and though 
I am a stranger to parental ties, can sufficiently conceive the 
happiness of which they are a source to congratulate you on 
your possession of two fine sons and a daughter. I do not smile 
at the idea of transplanting myself into your wilderness. Such 
a change of my abode is not, indeed, probable, yet I have no 
local partialities which can keep me from any place which promises the greatest real advantages. But if such a removal was 
not even possible, I should nevertheless be ready to communicate, as you desire, my Ideas towards a constitution of Government for the State in embryo. 
</p><p>
I pass over the general policy of the measure which calls for 
such a provision. It has been unanimously embraced by those 
who, being most interested in it, must have best considered it, 
and will, I dare say, be with equal unanimity acceded to by the 
other party, [Congress,] which is to be consulted. I will first 
offer some general remarks on the subject, and then answer 
your several queries. 
</p><p>
1. The Legislative Department ought by all means, as I 
think, to include a Senate, constituted on such principles as will 
give wisdom and steadiness to legislation. The want of these 
qualities is the grievance complained of in all our republics. 
The want of fidelity in the administration of power having been 
the grievance felt under most governments, and by the American States themselves under the British government, it was 
natural for them to give too exclusive an attention to this primary attribute. The Senate of Maryland, with a few amendments, is a good model. Trial has, I am told, verified the expectations from it. A similar one made a part of our Constitution as it was originally proposed, but the inexperience and 
jealousy of our then Councils rejected it in favor of our present 
Senate; a worse could hardly have been substituted; and yet, 
bad as it is, it is often a useful bit in the mouth of the House 
of Delegates. Not a single Session passes without instances of 
sudden resolutions by the latter, of which they repent in time 
to intercede privately with the Senate for their negative. For 
the other branch, models enough may be found; care ought, 
however, to be taken against its becoming too numerous, by fixing the number which it is never to exceed. The quorum, wages, 
and privileges, of both branches, ought also to be fixed. A majority seems to be the natural quorum. The wages of the members may be made payable for years to come, in the medium 
value of wheat for years preceding, as the same shall from 
period to period be rated by a respectable jury appointed for that 
purpose by the Supreme Court. The privileges of the members 
ought not, in my opinion, to extend beyond an exemption of their 
persons and equipage from arrests during the time of their 
actual serv.e. If it were possible, it would be well to define 
the extent of the Legislative power; but the nature of it seems 
in many respects to be indefinite. It is very practicable, however, to enumerate the essential exceptions. The Constitution 
may expressly restrain them from meddling with religion; from 
abolishing Juries; from taking away the Habeas Corpus; from 
forcing a citizen to give evidence against himself; from controuling the press; from enacting retrospective laws, at least in criminal cases; from abridging the right of suffrage; from taking 
private property for public use without paying its full value; 
from licensing the importation of slaves; from infringing the 
confederation, &c., &c. 
</p><p>
As a further security against fluctuating and indigested laws, 
the Constitution of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> has provided a Council of Revision. I approve much of such an institution, and believe it is 
considered by the most intelligent citizens of that State as a 
valuable safeguard both to public interests and to private rights. 
Another provision has been suggested for preserv.g system in 
Legislative proceedings, which to some may appear still better. 
It is that a standing committee, composed of a few select and 
and skilful individuals, should be appointed to prepare bills on 
all subjects which they may judge proper to be submitted to the 
Legislature at their meetings, and to draw bills for them during 
their Sessions. As an antidote both to the jealousy and danger 
of their acquiring an improper influence, they might be made 
incapable of holding any other office, Legislative, Executive, or 
Judiciary. I like this suggestion so much that I have had 
thoughts of proposing it to our Assembly, who give almost as 
many proofs as they pass laws of their need of some such assistance. 
</p><p>
2. The Executive Department. Though it claims the second 
place, it is not in my estimation entitled to it by its importance, 
all the great powers which are properly executive being transferred to the Federal Government. I have made up no final 
opinion whether the first Magistrate should be chosen by the 
Legislature or the people at large, or whether the power should 
be vested in one man, assisted by a Council, or in a Council, of 
which the President shall be only primus inter pares. There 
are examples of each in the United States; and probably advantages and disadvantages attending each. It is material, I 
think, that the number of members should be small, and that 
their Salaries should be either unalterable by the Legislature, 
or alterable only in such manner as will not affect any individual in place. Our Executive is the worst part of a bad Constitution. The members of it are dependent on the Legislature 
not only for their wages, but for their reputation, and therefore 
are not likely to withstand usurpations of that branch; they 
are, besides, too numerous and expensive; their organization 
vague and perplexed; and to crown the absurdity, some of the 
members may, without any new appointment, continue in Office 
for life, contrary to one of the Articles of the Declaration of 
Rights. 
</p><p>
3. The Judiciary Department merits every care. Its efficacy 
is demonstrated in Great Britain, where it maintains private 
right against all the corruptions of the two other Departments, 
and gives a reputation to the whole government which it is not 
in itself entitled to. The main points to be attended to are: 
1. That the Judges should hold their places during good behaviour. 2. That their Salaries should be either fixed like the 
wages of the Representatives, or not be alterable so as to affect 
the Individuals in Office. 3. That their Salaries be liberal. 
The first point is obvious; without the second, the independence 
aimed at by the first will be ideal only; without the third, the 
bar will be superior to the bench, which destroys all security 
for a systematic administration of justice. After securing these 
essential points, I should think it unadvisable to descend so far 
into detail as to bar any future modification of this department 
which experience may recommend. An enumeration of the principal Courts, with power to the Legislature to institute inferior 
Courts, may suffice. The Admiralty business can never be extensive in your situation, and may be referred to one of the 
other Courts. With regard to a Court of Chancery, as distinct 
from a Court of Law, the reasons of Lord Bacon on the affirmative side outweigh, in my judgment, those of Lord Kaimes on the 
other side; yet I should think it best to leave this important 
question to be decided by future lights, without tying the hands 
of the Legislature one way or the other. I consider our County 
Courts as on a bad footing, and would never, myself, consent to 
copy them into another Constitution. 
</p><p>
All the States seem to have seen the necessity of providing 
for Impeachments, but none of them to have hit on an unexceptionable tribunal. In some the trial is referred to the Senate, 
in others to the Executive, in others to the Judiciary department. It has been suggested that a tribunal composed of members from each department would be better than either, and 
I entirely concur in that opinion. I proceed next to your 
queries. 
</p><p>
1. "Whether is a representation according to numbers, or 
" property, or in a joint proportion to both, the most safe? Or 
" is a representation by Counties preferable to a more equitable 
" mode that will be difficult to adjust?" Under this question 
may be considered: 1. The right of suffrage. 2. The mode of 
suffrage. 3. The plan of representation. As to the first, I 
think the extent which ought to be given to this right a matter 
of great delicacy and of critical importance. To restrain it to 
the land holders will in time exclude too great a proportion of 
citizens; to extend it to all citizens without regard to property, 
or even to all who possess a pittance, may throw too much 
power into hands which will either abuse it themselves or sell 
it to the rich who will abuse it. I have thought it might be a 
good middle course to narrow this right in the choice of the 
least popular, and to enlarge it in that of the more popular 
branch of the Legislature. There is an example of this distinction in North Carolina, if in none of the other States. How it 
operates or is relished by the people I cannot say. It would 
not be surprising if in the outset, at least, it should offend the 
sense of equality which reigns in a free country. In a general 
view, I see no reason why the rights of property, which chiefly 
bears the burden of Government, and is so much an object of 
Legislation, should not be respected as well as personal rights 
in the choice of Rulers. It must be owned, indeed, that property will give influence to the holder, though it should give him 
no legal privileges, and will in general be safe on that as well 
as on other accounts, especially if the business of legislation be 
guarded with the provisions hinted at. 2. As to the mode of 
suffrage, I lean strongly to that of the ballot, notwithstanding 
the objections which lie against it. It appears to me to be the 
only radical cure for those arts of electioneering which poison 
the very fountain of Liberty. The States in which the ballot 
has been the standing mode are the only instances in which 
elections are tolerably chaste and those arts in disgrace. If it 
should be thought improper to fix this mode by the Constitution, I should think it at least necessary to avoid any constitutional bar to a future adoption of it.* 3. By the plan of representation I mean: 1. The classing of the electors. 2. The 
proportioning of the representatives to each class. The first 
cannot be otherwise done than by geographical description, as 
by Counties. The second may easily be done, in the first instance, either by comprising within each County an equal number of Electors, or by proportioning the number of representatives of each County to its number of Electors. The difficulty 
arises from the disproportionate increase of electors in different 
Counties. There seem to be two methods only by which the 
representation can be equalized from time to time. The first is 
to change the bounds of the Counties; the second, to change the 
number of representatives allotted to them, respectively. As 
the former would not only be most troublesome and expensive, 
but would involve a variety of other adjustments, the latter 
method is evidently the best. Examples of a Constitutional 
provision for it exists in several of the States. In some it is to 
be executed periodically; in others, pro re nata. The latter 
seems most accurate and very practicable. I have already intimated the propriety of fixing the number of representatives, 
which ought never to be exceeded; I should suppose one hundred and fifty, or even one hundred, might safely be made the 
ne plus ultra for Kentucky. 
</p><p>
2. "Which is to be preferred; an annual, triennial, or septen" nial succession to offices, or frequent elections without limita" tions in choice, or that officers when chosen should continue 
" quamdiu se bene gesserv.t?" The rule ought no doubt to be 
different in the different departments of power. For one part 
of the Legislature annual elections will, I suppose, be held indispensable; though some of the ablest Statesmen and soundest 
Republicans in the United States are in favor of triennial. The 
great danger in departing from annual elections in this case 
lies in the want of some other natural term to limit the departure. For the other branch, four or five years may be the period. 
For neither branch does it seem necessary or proper to prohibit 
an indefinite re-eligibility. With regard to the Executive, if 
the elections be frequent, and particularly if made as to any 
member of it by the people at large, a re-eligibility cannot, I 
think, be objected to. If they be unfrequent, a temporary or 
perpetual incapacitation, according to the degree of unfrequency, 
at least in the case of the first Magistrate, may not be amiss. 
As to the Judiciary department, enough has been said; and as 
to the subordinate officers, civil and military, nothing need be 
said more than that a regulation of their appointments may, 
under a few restrictions, be safely trusted to the Legislature. 
3. "How far may the same person with propriety be em" ployed in the different departments of Government in an in" fant country, where the counsel of every individual may be 
" needed? " Temporary deviations from fundamental principles 
are always more or less dangerous. When the first pretext 
fails, those who become interested in prolonging the evil will 
rarely be at a loss for other pretexts. The first precedent, too, 
familiarises the people to the irregularity, lessens their veneration for those fundamental principles, and makes them a more 
easy prey to ambition and self interest. Hence it is that abuses 
of every kind, when once established, have been so often found 
to perpetuate themselves. In this caution, I refer chiefly to an 
improper mixture of the three great Departments within the 
State. A delegation to Congress is, I conceive, compatible 
with either. 
</p><p>
4. " Should there be a periodical review of the Constitution? " 
Nothing appears more eligible in theory, nor has sufficient trial, 
perhaps, been yet made to condemn it in practice. Pennsylvania has alone adopted the expedient. Her citizens are much 
divided on the subject of their Constitution in general, and 
probably on this part of it in particular. I am inclined to think, 
though am far from being certain, that it is not a favorite part 
even with those who are fondest of their Constitution. Another 
plan has been thought of, which might, perhaps, succeed better, 
and would at the same time be a safeguard to the equilibrium 
of the constituent departments of Government. This is, that a 
majority of any two of the three departments should have authority to call a plenipotentiary convention whenever they may 
think their constitutional powers have been violated by the 
other department, or that any material part of the Constitution 
needs amendment. In your situation, I should think it both 
imprudent and indecent not to leave a door open for at least 
one revision of your first establishment imprudent, because 
you have neither the same resources for supporting nor the 
same lights for framing a good establishment now as you will 
have fifteen or twenty years hence indecent, because an handful of early settlers ought not to preclude a populous country 
from a choice of the Government under which they and their 
posterity are to live. Should your first Constitution be made 
thus temporary, the objections against an intermediate union of 
offices will be proportionably lessened. Should a revision of it 
aot be made thus necessary and certain, there will be little 
probability of its being ever revised. Faulty as our Constitution is, as well with regard to the authority which formed it as 
to the manner in which it is formed, the issue of an experiment 
has taught us the difficulty of amending it. And although the 
issue might have proceeded from the unseasonableness of the 
time, yet it may be questioned whether, at any future time, the 
greater depth to which it will have stricken its roots will not 
counterbalance any more auspicious circumstances for overturning it. 
</p><p>
5 & 6. " Or will it be better unalterably to fix some leading 
" principles in government, and make it consistent for the Legis" lature to introduce such changes in lesserv.atters as may 
"become expedient? Can Censors be provided that will im" partially point out deficiences in the Constitution and the 
" violations that may happen?" 
</p><p>
Answers on these points may be gathered from what has been 
already said. 
</p><p>
I have been led to offer my sentiments in this loose form 
rather than to attempt a delineation of such a plan of government as would please myself, not only by my ignorance of many 
local circumstances and opinions which must be consulted in 
such a work, but also by the want of sufficient time for it. At 
the receipt of your letter I had other employment, and what I 
now write is in the midst of preparations for a journey of business, which will carry me as far as <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> at least, and 
on which I shall set out in a day or two. 
</p><p>
I am sorry that it is not in my power to give you some satisfactory information concerning the Mississippi. A Minister 
from Spain has been with Congress for some time, and is authorised, as I understand, to treat on whatever subjects may 
concern the two nations. If any explanations or propositions 
have passed between him and the Minister of Congress, they 
are as yet in the list of Cabinet secrets. As soon as any such 
shall be made public and come to my knowledge, I shall take 
the first opportunity of transmitting them. Wishing you and 
your family all happiness, 
</p><p>
I am, D'r Sir, your friend and serv.t. 
</p><p>
* The Constitution of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> directs an experiment on this subject.
