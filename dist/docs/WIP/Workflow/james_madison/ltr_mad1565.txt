DEAR SIR, My last was of the 11th of February, and went 
by the packet. This will go to England in the care of a French 
gentleman, who will consign it to the care of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>. 
</p><p>
The appointments for the Convention go on auspiciously. 
Since niy last, Georgia, South Carolina, <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, have come into the measure. The 
first and the last of these States have commissioned their delegates to Congress as their representatives in Convention. The 
deputation of Massachusetts consists of Mess. Gorham, Dana, 
King, Gerry, and Strong. That of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Mess". Hamilton, Yates, and Lansing. That of South Carolina, Mess. J. 
Rutledge, Laurens, Pinckney, (General,) Butler, and Charles Pinckney, lately member of Congress. The States which have 
not yet appointed are Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maryland. The last has taken measures which prove her intention 
to appoint, and the two former it is not doubted will follow the 
example of their neighbours. I just learn from the Governor 
of Virginia that <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> has resigned his place in the deputation from that State, and that General Nelson is put into it 
by the Executive, who were authorised to fill vacancies. The 
Governor, Mr. Wythe, and Mr. Blair, will attend, and some 
hopes are entertained of Col. Mason's attendance. <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> has prudently authorised no expectations of his 
attendance, but has not either precluded himself absolutely from 
stepping into the field if the crisis should demand it. 
</p><p>
What may be the result of this political experiment cannot 
be foreseen. The difficulties which present themselves are, on 
one side, almost sufficient to dismay the most sanguine, whilst 
on the other side the most timid are compelled to encounter 
them by the mortal diseases of the existing Constitution. These 
diseases need not be pointed out to you, who so well understand 
them. Suffice it to say, that they are at present marked by 
symptoms which are truly alarming, which have tainted the 
faith of the most orthodox republicans, and which challenge 
from the votaries of liberty every concession in favor of stable 
Government not infringing fundamental principles, as the only 
security against an opposite extreme of our present situation.

I think myself that it will be expedient, in the first place, to 
lay the foundation of the new system in such a ratification by 
the people themselves of the several States as will render it 
clearly paramount to their Legislative authorities. 2 dly . Over 
and above the positive power of regulating trade and sundry 
other matters in which uniformity is proper, to arm the federal 
head with a negative in all cases whatsoever on the local Legislatures. Without this defensive power, experience and reflection have satisfied me that, however ample the federal powers 
may be made, or however clearly their boundaries may be delineated on paper, they will be easily and continually baffled by 
the Legislative sovereignties of the States. The effects of this 
provision would be not only to guard the national rights and 
interests against invasion, but also to restrain the States from 
thwarting and molesting each other; and even from oppressing 
the minority within themselves by paper money and other unrighteous measures which favor the interest of the majority. In 
order to render the exercise of such a negative prerogative convenient, an emanation of it must be vested in some set of men 
within the several States, so far as to enable them to give a 
temporary sanction to laws of immediate necessity. 3 dlr . To 
change the principle of Representation in the federal system. 
Whilst the execution <5f the acts of Congress depends on the 
several Legislatures, the equality of votes does not destroy the 
inequality of importance and influence in the States. But in 
case of such an augmentation of the federal power as will render it efficient without the intervention of the Legislatures, a 
vote in the general Councils from Delaware would be of equal 
value with one from Massachusetts or Virginia. This change, 
therefore, is just. I think, also, it will be practicable. A majority of the States conceive that they will be gainers by it. It 
is recommended to the Eastern States by the actual superiority 
of their populousness, and to the Southern by their expected 
superiority; and if a majority of the larger States concur, the 
fewer and smaller States must finally bend to them. This point 
being gained, many of the objections now urged in the leading 
States against renunciations of power will vanish. 4 thly . To 
organize the federal powers in such a manner as not to blend 
together those which ought to be exercised by separate departments. The limited powers now vested in Congress are frequently mismanaged from the want of such a distribution of 
them. What would be the case under an enlargement not only 
of the powers, but the number of the federal Representatives? 
These are some of the leading ideas which have occurred to me, 
but which may appear to others as improper as they appear to 
me necessary.
