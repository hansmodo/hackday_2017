DEAR SIR, I have your favor of the 27th ult., and congratulate you on the deliverance of our country from the distresses of actual invasion. The spirit it has shewn on this 
occasion will, I hope, in some degree protect it from a second 
visit.

Congress yesterday received from <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a> and Mr. Carmichael, as late as the 4th and 9th of September. The 
general tenor of them is that we are not to rely on much aid in 
the article of cash from Spain, her finances and credit being 
scarcely adequate to her own necessities, and that the British 
emissaries are indefatigable in misrepresenting our affairs in 
that kingdom, and in endeavoring to detach it from the war. 
The character, however, of the Catholic King for steadiness and 
probity, and the entire confidence of our allies in him, forbid 
any distrust on our part. Portugal, on the pressing remonstrances of France and Spain, has at length agreed to shut her 
ports against English prizes, but still refuses to accede to the 
armed neutrality. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> writes that the news of the fate 
of the Quebec and Jamaica fleets arrived at <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> nearly 
about the same time, and had a very serv.us effect on all ranks, 
as well as on stocks and insurance.

Our information from the West Indies gives a melancholy 
picture of the effects of the late tempest. Martinique has suffered very considerably, both in shipping and people. Not less 
than six hundred houses have been destroyed in St. Vincent's. 
The Spaniards in Cuba, also, have not escaped, and it is reported 
that the fleet on its way from the Havannah to Pensacola has 
been so disabled and dispersed as to defeat the expedition for the 
present. On the other side, our enemies have suffered severely. 
The Ajax, a ship of the line, and two frigates stationed off St. 
Lucie, to intercept the Martinique trade, are certainly lost, with 
the greatest part, if not the whole, of their crews; and there is 
great reason to believe that several other capital ships that 
have not been since heard of have shared the like fate. The 
island of St. Lucie is totally defaced. In Barbadoes, also, 
scarce a house remains entire, and one thousand five hundred 
persons at least have perished. One of the largest towns in 
Jamaica has been totally swept away, and the island otherwise 
much damaged. The consequences of this calamity must afford 
a striking proof to Great Britain of her folly in shutting our 
ports against her West India commerce, and transferring the 
advantage of our friendship to her enemies. 
I am, Dr sir, yours sincerely.
