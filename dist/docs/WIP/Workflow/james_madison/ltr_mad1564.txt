DEAR SIR, Recollecting to have heard you mention a plan 
formed by the Empress of Russia for a comparative view of the 
Aborigines of the new Continent, and of the N. E. parts of the 
old, through the medium of their respective tongues, and that 
her wishes had been conveyed to you for your aid in obtaining 
the American vocabularies, I have availed myself of an opportunity, offered by the kindness of <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel=''>Mr. Hawkins</a>, of taking a 
copy of such a sample of the Cherokee and Choctaw dialects as 
his late commission to treat with them enabled him to obtain, 
and do myself the honor now of enclosing it. I do not know 
how far the list of words made use of by <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel=''>Mr. Hawkins</a> may correspond with the standard of the Empress, nor how far nations 
so remote as the Cherokees and Choctaws from the N. W. 
shores of America may fall within the scheme of comparison. 
I presume, however, that a great proportion, at least, of the 
words will answer, and that the laudable curiosity which suggests investigations of this sort will be pleased with every enlargement of the field for indulging it. Not finding it convenient to retain a copy of the enclosed, as I wished to do, for myself, I must ask the favor of your amanuensis to perform that 
task for me. 
</p><p>
The appointments for the Convention go on very successfully. 
Since the date of my last, Georgia, South Carolina, <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, 
Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, have come into the measure. Georgia and New Hampshire have constituted their Delegates in Congress their representatives in Convention. South 
Carolina has appointed <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague'>Mr. J. Rutledge</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=ccp' rel=''>General Pinckney</a>, Mr. Laurens, Major Butler, and Mr. Charles Pinckney, late member 
of Congress. The deputies of Massachusetts are Mr. Dana, <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. King</a>, Mr. Gorham, Mr. Gerry, Mr. Strong. I am told that a 
Resolution of the Legislature of this State, which originated 
with their Senate, lays its deputies under the fetter of not departing from the 5 th of the present articles of Confederation. 
As this Resolution passed before the recommendatory act of 
Congress was known, it is conjectured that it may be rescinded; 
but its having passed at all denotes a much greater prevalence 
of political jealousy in that quarter than had been imagined. 
The deputation of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> consists of <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, 
Judge Yates, and a Mr. Lansing. The two last are said to be 
pretty much linked to the anti-federal party here, and are likely, 
of course, to be a clog on their colleague. It is not doubted, 
now, that Connecticut and Rhode Island will avoid the singularity of being unrepresented in the Convention. 
</p><p>
The thinness of Congress has been an obstacle to all the important business before them. At present there are nine States 
on the ground; but this number, though adequate to every object when unanimous, makes a slow progress in business that 
requires seven States only. And I see little prospect of the 
number being increased. 
</p><p>
By our latest and most authentic information from Massachusetts, it would seem that a calm has been restored by the expedition of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel=''>General Lincoln</a>. The precautions taking by the 
State, however, betray a great distrust of its continuance. Besides their act disqualifying the malcontents from voting in the 
election of members for the Legislature, &c., another has been 
passed for raising a corps of 1,000 or 1,500 men, and appropriating the choicest revenues of the country to its support. It is 
said that at least half of the insurgents decline accepting the 
terms annexed to the amnesty, and that this defiance of the law 
against Treason is countenanced not only by the impunity with 
which they shew themselves on public occasions, even with insolent badges of their character, but by marks of popular favor 
conferred on them in various instances in the election to local 
offices. 
</p><p>
A proposition has been introduced and discussed in the Legislature of this State for relinquishing its claim to Vermont, and 
urging the admission of it into the Confederacy. As far as I 
can learn, difficulties will arise only in settling the form, the 
substance of the measures being not disliked by any of the parties. It is wished by those who are not interested in claims to 
lands within that district to guard against any responsibility 
in the State for compensation. On the other side, it will at 
least be insisted that they shall not be barred the privilege of 
carrying their claims before a federal court, in case Vermont 
shall become a party to the Union. I think it probable, if she 
should not decline becoming such altogether, that she will make 
two conditions, if not more: 1. That neither her boundaries 
nor the rights of her citizens shall be impeachable under the 
9 th article of Confederation. 2. That no share of the public 
debt already contracted shall be allotted to her. 
</p><p>
I have a letter from Col. John Campbell, dated at Pittsburg, 
from which I gather that the people of that quarter are thrown 
into great agitation by the reported intention of Congress concerning the Mississippi, and that measures are on foot for uniting the minds of all the different settlements which have a 
common interest at stake. Should this policy take effect, I 
think there is much ground to apprehend that the ambition of individuals will quickly mix itself with the first impulses of resentment and interest; that by degrees the people may be led to set 
up for themselves; that they will slide, like Vermont, insensibly 
into a communication and latent connection with their British 
neighbors, and, in pursuance of the same example, make such a 
disposition of the Western Territory as will entice into it most 
effectually emigrants from all parts of the Union. If these apprehensions be not imaginary, they suggest many observ.ions 
extremely interesting to Spain as well as to the United States. 
</p><p>
I hear from <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, with much concern, that <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> 
has positively declined his mission to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. Besides 
the loss of his serv.es on that theatre, there is danger, I fear that this step has proceeded from a wish to leave his conduct 
unfettered on another theatre, where the result of the Convention will receive its destiny from his omnipotence. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of esteem and affection, I remain, Dear 
Sir, your obt and very h'ble serv.
