DEAR SIR -
</p><p>
I had seen Paine's pamphlet, with the preface of the <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Editor. It immediately occured that you were brought 
into the Frontispiece in the manner you explain. But I had 
not foreseen the particular use made of it by the British partizans. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> can least of all complain. Under a mock 
defence of the Republican Constitutions of his Country, he attacked them with all the force he possessed, and this in a book 
with his name to it, whilst he was the Representative of his 
Country at a foreign Court. Since he has been the 2 d magistrate in the new Republic, his pen has constantly been at work 
in the same cause; and though his name has not been prefixed 
to his anti-republican discourses, the author has been as well 
known as if that formality had been observ.. Surely, if it be 
innocent and decent in one serv.t of the public thus to write 
attacks against its Government, it cannot be very criminal or indecent in another to patronize a written defence of the principles 
on which that Government is founded. The sensibility of Hammond and Bond for the indignity to the British Constitution is 
truly ridiculous. If offence could be justly taken in that quarter, what would France have a right to say to Burke's pamphlet, 
and the countenance given to it and its author, particularly by 
the King himself? What, in fact, might not the United States 
say, whose revolution and democratic Governments come in for 
a large charge of the scurrility lavished on those of France? 
</p><p>
I do not foresee any objection to the route you propose. I 
had conversed with Beckley on a trip to <a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, &c., and still 
have that in view; but the time in view for starting from this 
place will leave room for the previous excursion. Health, recreation, and curiosity, being my objects, I can never be out of 
my way. 
</p><p>
Not a word of news here. Myfrom Virginia say little more than those you had received. Carrington says the returns have come in pretty thickly of late, and warrant the estimate founded on the Counties named to me some time ago. As 
well as I recollect these averaged upwards of 8,000 souls, and 
were considered by him as under the general average. 
</p><p>
Yrs affectionately.
