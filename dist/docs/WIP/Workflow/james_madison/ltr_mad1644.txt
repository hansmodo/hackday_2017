MY DEAR FRIEND, I am just favored with yours of the 27th 
Ultimo. My last was sent from <a href="/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a>, and as the receipt 
of it is not mentioned, I fear that it may have miscarried. I 
have not sooner written from this place because I waited for 
an opportunity of collecting the features and complexion of the 
new Government, which, in its Legislative capacity, never became practically organized till the 6th instant, and in its Executive capacity will not be so for 10 or 15 days.

The subject taken up in this House is an impost. Opinions 
are divided on the point whether the first plan shall be a hasty 
and temporary essay, or be digested into a form as little imperfect as the want of experience will admit. There are plausible arguments on both sides. The former loses ground daily, 
from the apparent impracticability of reaping the Spring harvest from importations. It is probable that the law will, in the 
event, be limited to a longer or a shorter duration, according to 
the accuracy and extent which can within a decent time be given 
to its provisions. I need not remark to you the difficulty of the 
work. Nothing but experience and successive revisions can 
render it tolerably adequate and respectable. There will be 
difficulty, also, in adjusting a scale of duties, &c., to the different 
ideas and interests of different States and Statesmen. But I 
suspect the latter difficulty will be less perplexing than the 
former, though I know a contrary apprehension has prevailed. 
The Senate have appointed a Committee on the subject of the 
Judiciary Department.

On the subject of amendments, nothing has been publickly, 
and very little privately, said. Such as I am known to have 
espoused will, as far as I can gather, be attainable from the 
federalists, who sufficiently predominate in both branches, 
though with some the concurrence will proceed from a spirit 
of conciliation rather than conviction. Connecticut is least inclined, though I presume not inflexibly opposed, to a moderate 
revision. A paper, which will probably be republished in the 
Virginia Gazettes, under the signature of a citizen of New 
Haven, unfolds Mr. Sherman's opinions. Whatever the amendments may be, it is clear that they will be attempted in no other 
way than through Congress. Many of the warmest of the opponents of the Government disavow the mode contended for by 
Virginia.

I wish I could see an equal prospect of appeasing the disquietude on the two other points you mention British debts 
and taxes. With respect to the first, you know my sentiments. 
It will be the duty of the Senate, in my opinion, to promote 
regulations with Great Britain as speedily as circumstances will 
admit, and the aspect of the Government seems likely to command a respectful attention to its measures. I see nothing else 
that can be done. As to the taxes, I see nothing that can be 
done more than the ordinary maxims of policy suggest. They 
may certainly be diminished in consequence of the revolution 
in the federal Government, since the public wants will be little 
if at all increased, and may be supplied in greater proportion 
out of commerce.
