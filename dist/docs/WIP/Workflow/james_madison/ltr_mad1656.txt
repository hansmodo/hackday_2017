DEAR SIR, By this conveyance you will receive permission, 
through <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a>, to make your proposed visit to America. I 
fear it will not reach you in time for your arrival here before 
the commencement of the windy season; yet I hope the delay 
will not oblige you to postpone your voyage till the Spring. 
</p><p>
The federal business has proceeded with a mortifying tardiness, chargeable in part on the incorrect draughts of committees, 
and the prolixity of discussion incident to a public body, every 
member of which almost takes a positive agency, but principally resulting from the novelty and complexity of the subjects 
of Legislation. We are in a wilderness, without a single footstep to guide us. Our successors will have an easier task, and 
by degrees the way will become smooth, short, and certain. 
</p><p>
My last informed you of some of the difficulties attending a 
regulation of the duties. The bill on that subject has at length 
received the fiat of both Houses, and will be forthwith made a 
law by the concurrence of the President. The rates are not 
precisely on the scale first settled by the House of Representatives. The most material change is in the articles of rum and 
molasses. The necessity of preserv.g a certain ratio between 
them is obvious. The ratio sent to the Senate was that of 12 
cents on the former, and 5 do. on the latter. The Senate 
returned them in the ratio of 8 and 2J, which has, after a conference, prevailed. 
</p><p>
The Senate has prevailed on another point in the bill, which 
had undergone more discussion, and produced more difficulty. 
It had been proposed by the House of Representatives that, 
besides a discrimination in the tonnage, a small reduction should 
be made in the duty on distilled spirits imported from countries 
in Treaty with the United States. The Senate were opposed to 
any discrimination whatsoever, contending that even Great 
Britain should stand on the same footing with the most favored 
nations. The arguments on that side of the question were that 
the United States were not bound by treaty to give any commercial preferences to particular nations; that they were not 
bound by gratitude, since our allies had been actuated by their 
own interest, and had obtained their compensation in the dismemberment of a rival empire; that in national, and particularly 
in commercial measures, gratitude was, moreover, no proper 
motive, interest alone being the Statesman's guide; that Great 
Britain made no discrimination against the United States compared with other nations, but, on the contrary, distinguished 
them by a number of advantages; that if Great Britain possessed almost the whole of our trade, it proceeded from causes 
which proved that she could carry it on for us on better terms 
than the other nations of Europe; that we were too dependent 
on her trade to risk her displeasure by irritating measures, 
which might induce her to put us on a worse footing than at 
present; that a small discrimination could only irritate, without 
operating on her interests or fears; that if anything were done 
it would be best to make a bolder stroke at once, and that, in 
fact, the Senate had appointed a committee to consider the subject in that point of view. On the other side, it was contended 
that it would be absurd to give away everything that could 
purchase the stipulations wanted by us; that the motives in 
which the new Government originated, the known sentiments 
of the people at large, and the laws of most of the States subsequent to the peace, shewed clearly that a distinction between 
nations in Treaty and nations not in Treaty would coincide 
with the public opinion, and that it would be offensive to a 
great number of citizens to see Great Britain, in particular, 
put on the footing of the most favored nations, by the first act 
of a Government instituted for the purpose of uniting the States 
in the vindication of their commercial interests against her 
monopolizing regulations; that this respect to the sentiments 
of the people was the more necessary in the present critical 
state of the Government; that our trade at present entirely 
contradicted the advantages expected from the Revolution, no 
new channels being opened with other European nations, and 
the British channels being removed by a refusal of the most 
natural and valuable one to the United States;* that this evil 
proceeded from the deep hold the British monopoly had taken 
of our country, and the difficulty experienced by France, Holland, &c., in entering into competition with her; that in order 
to break this monopoly, those nations ought to be aided till 
they could contend on equal terms; that the market of France 
was particularly desirable to us; that her disposition to open it 
would depend on the disposition manifested on our part, <fcc., 
&c.; that our trade would not be in its proper channels until it 
should flow directly to the countries making the exchange, in 
which case, too, American vessels would have a due share in 
the transaction, whereas at present the whole carriage of our 
bulky produce is confined to British Bottoms; that with respect 
to Great Britain, we had good reason to suppose that her conduct would be regulated by the apparent temper of the new 
Government; that a passiveness under her restrictions would 
confirm her in them, whilst an evidence of intention as well as 
ability to face them would ensure a reconsideration of her 
policy; that it would be sufficient to begin with a moderate discrimination, exhibiting a readiness to invigorate our measures 
as circumstances might require; that we had no reason to 
apprehend a disposition in Great Britain to resort to a commercial contest, or the consequences of such an experiment, her 
dependence on us being greater than ours on her. The supplies 
of the United States are necessary to the existence, and their 
market to the value, of her islands. The returns are either 
superfluities or poisons. In time of famine, the cry of which is 
heard every three or four years, the bread of the United States 
is essential. In time of war, which is generally decided in the 
West Indies, friendly offices, not violating the duties of neutrality, might effectually turn the scale in favor of an adversary. 
In the direct trade with Great Britain, the consequences ought 
to be equally dreaded by her. The raw and bulky exports of 
the United States employ her shipping, contribute to her revenue, enter into her manufactures, and enrich her merchants, who 
stand between the United States and the consuming nations of 
Europe. A suspension of the intercourse would suspend all 
these advantages, force the trade into rival channels from which 
it might not return, and besides a temporary loss of a market 
for | of her exports, hasten the establishment of manufactures 
here, which would so far cut off the market forever. On the 
other side, the United States would suffer but little. The manufactures of Great Britain, as far as desirable, would find their 
way through other channels, and if the price were a little augmented it would only diminish an excessive consumption. They 
could do almost wholly without such supplies, and better without than with many of them. In one important view the contest would be particularly in their favor. The articles of 
luxury, a privation of which would be salutary to them, being 
the work of the indigent, may be regarded as necessaries to the 
manufacturing party: that it was probable nothing would be 
done at this session, if at all, in the way projected in the Senate; 
and in case a discord of opinion as to the mode, the degree, and 
the time of our regulations should become apparent, an argument would be drawn from it in favor of the very policy 
hitherto pursued by Great Britain. The event of the tonnage 
bill, in which the discrimination was meant to be most insisted 
on by the House of Representatives, is not yet finally decided. 
But here, also, the Senate will prevail. It was determined yesterday in that House to adhere to their amendment for striking 
out the clause, and there is no reason to suppose that the other 
House will let the Bill be lost. I mentioned in my last that 
both the Senators of Virginia were for admitting Britain to an 
equality with the most favored nation. This was a mistake as 
to Grayson. 
</p><p>
The other bills depending relate to the collection of the Impost, and the establishment of a war, foreign, and Treasury 
Department. The bills on the two first of these departments 
have passed the House of Representatives, and are before the 
Senate. They gave birth to a very interesting constitutional 
question by what authority removals from office were to be 
made. The Constitution being silent on the point, it was left 
to construction. Four opinions were advanced: 1. That no 
removal could be made but by way of impeachment. To this 
it was objected that it gave to every officer, down to tide waiters 
and tax gatherers, the tenure of good behaviour. 2. That it devolved on the Legislature, to be disposed of as might be proper. 
To this it was objected that the Legislature might then dispose 
of it to be exercised by themselves, or even by the House of 
Representatives. 3. That it was incident to the power of appointment, and therefore belonged to the President and Senate. 
To this it was said that the Senate, being a Legislative body, 
could not be considered in an Executive light farther than was 
expressly declared; that such a construction would transfer the 
trust of seeing the laws duly executed from the President, the 
most responsible, to the Senate, the least responsible branch of 
the Government; that officers would intrench themselves behind 
a party in the Senate, bid defiance to the President, and introduce anarchy and discord into the Executive Department; that 
the Senate were to be Judges in case of impeachment, and ought 
not, therefore, to be previously called on for a summary opinion 
on questions of removal; that in their Legislative character they 
ought to be kept as cool and unbiased as possible, as the constitutional check on the passions and parties of the other House, 
and should, for that reason also, be as little concerned as possible in those personal matters, which are the great source of 
factious animosities. 4. That the Executive power being generally vested in the President, and the Executive function of 
removal not expressly taken away, it remained with the President. To this was objected the rule of construction on which 
the third opinion rested, and the danger of creating too much 
weight in the Executive scale. After very long debates, the 
4 th opinion prevailed, as most consonant to the text of the Constitution, to the policy of mixing the Legislative and Executive 
Departments as little as possible, and to the requisite responsibility and harmony in the Executive Department. What the 
decision of the Senate will be cannot yet be even conjectured. 
As soon as the bills are passed, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='co-worker'>General Knox</a> will 
of course have their commissions renewed. 
</p><p>
The bill relating to the Treasury Department is still before 
the House of Representatives. The Board will be discontinued, but the business will be so arranged as to make the comptroller and other officers checks on the Head of the Department. It is not clear who this will be. The members of Congress are disqualified. Hamilton is most talked of. 
The Senate have in hand a bill for the Judiciary Department. 
It is found a pretty arduous task, and will probably be long on 
its way through the two Houses. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a copy of sundry amendments to the Constitution 
lately proposed in the House of Representatives. Every thing 
of a controvertible nature that might endanger the concurrence 
of two-thirds of each House and three-fourths of the States was 
studiously avoided. This will account for the omission of several amendments which occur as proper. The subject will not 
be taken up till the revenue and Department bills are passed. 
</p><p>
The President has been ill. His fever terminated in a large 
anthrax on the upper end of his thigh, which is likely to confine him for some time. Wishing you an expeditious and safe 
passage across the Atlantic, I am, my dear Sir, yours, &c.

* With the West Indies.
