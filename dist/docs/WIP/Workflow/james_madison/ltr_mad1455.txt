DEAR B., I received your letter dated March the 1st about 
a week ago; and it is not more to obey your demands than to 
fulfil my own desires that I give you this early answer. I am 
glad you disclaim all punctiliousness in our correspondence. 
For my own part I confess I have not the face to perform ceremony in person, and I equally detest it on paper; though as 
Tully says, It cannot blush. Friendship, like all truth, delights 
in plainness and simplicity, and it is the counterfeit alone that 
needs ornament and ostentation. I am so thoroughly persuaded 
of this, that when I observ.any one over complaisant to me in 
his professions and promises, I am tempted to interpret his 
language thus: " As I have no real esteem for you, and for certain reasons think it expedient to appear well in your eye, I 
endeavor to varnish falsehood with politeness, which I think I 
can do in so ingenious a manner that so vain a blockhead as 
you cannot see through it." 
</p><p>
I would have you write to me when you feel as you used to 
do, when we were under the same roof, and you found it a 
recreation and release from business and books to come and 
chat an hour or two with me. The case is such with me that I 
am too remote from the post to have the same choice, but it 
seldom happens that an opportunity catches me out of a humor 
of writing to my old Nassovian friends, and you know what 
place you hold among them. 
</p><p>
I have not seen a single piece against the Doctor's address. 
I saw a piece advertised for publication in the <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
Gazette, entitled " Candid remarks," &c., and that is all I know 
about it. These things seldom reach Virginia, and when they 
do, I am out of the way of them. I have a curiosity to read 
those authors who write with " all the rage of impotence," not 
because there is any excellence or wit in their writings, but 
because they implicitly proclaim the merit of those they are railing against, and give them an occasion of shewing by their 
silence and contempt that they are invulnerable. I am heartily 
obliged to you for your kind offer of sending me some of these 
performances. I should also willingly accept Freneau's works, 
and the " serv.ns to Doctors in Divinity," which I hear are 
published, and whatever else you reckon worth reading. Please 
to note the cost of the articles, for I will by no means suffer our 
acquaintance to be an expense on your part alone, and I have 
nothing fit to send you to make it reciprocal. In your next 
letter be more particular as to yourself, your intentions, present 
employments, &c., Erwin, McPherson, <fec., the affairs of the 
college. Is the lottery like to come to anything ? There has 
happened no change in my purposes since you heard from me 
last. My health is a little better, owing, I believe, to more 
activity and less study, recommended by physicians. I shall 
try, if possible, to devise some business that will afford me a 
sight of you once more in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> within a year or two. 
I wish you would resolve the same with respect to me in Virginia, though within a shorter time. I am sorry my situation 
affords me nothing new, curious, or entertaining, to pay you for 
your agreeable information and remarks. You, being at the 
fountain head of political and literary intelligence, and I in an 
obscure corner, you must expect to be greatly loserv.n that 
score by our correspondence. But as you have entered upon it, 
I am determined to hold you to it, and shall give you some very 
severe admonitions whenever I perceive a remissness or brevity 
in yourI do not intend this as a beginning of reproof, 
but as a caution to you never to make it necessary at all. 
</p><p>
If Mr. Horton is in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, give him my best thanks for 
his kindness in assisting Mr. Wallace to do some business for 
[ ?] not long ago. 
</p><p>
I must re-echo your pressing invitations to [ ?] 
</p><p>
do with the more confidence as I have complied. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, yours, most unfeignedly.
