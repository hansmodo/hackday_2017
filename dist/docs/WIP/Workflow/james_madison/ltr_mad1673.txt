MY DEAR FRIEND, I have received the few lines you dropped 
me from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, and daily expect those promised from 
<a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>. I am made somewhat anxious on the latter 
point by the indisposition under which you were travelling. 
</p><p>
The question depending at your departure was negatived by 
a very large majority, though less than stated in the newspapers. The causes of this disproportion, which exceeds 
greatly the estimate you carried with you, cannot be altogether explained. Some of them you will conjecture. Others 
I reserv.for conversation, if the subject should ever enter 
into it. As far as I have heard, the prevailing sense of the 
people at large does not coincide with the decision, and that 
delay and other means might have produced a very different 
result.

The assumption of the State debts has of late employed most 
the House of Representatives. A majority of 5 agreed to the 
measure in Committee of the whole. But it is yet to pass many 
defiles, and its enemies will soon be reinforced by North Carolina. The event is consequently very doubtful. It could not 
be admissible to Virginia unless subserv.nt to final justice, or 
so varied as to be more consistent with intermediate justice. 
In neither of these respects has Virginia been satisfied, and the 
whole delegation is against the measure, except Bland ! 
</p><p>
The substance of the Secretary's arrangements of the Debts 
of the Union has been agreed to in Committee of the whole, 
and will probably be agreed to by the House. The number of 
alterations have been reduced for the sake of greater simplicity, 
and a disposition appears at present to shorten the duration of 
the Debt. According to the Report, the debt would subsist 40 
or 50 years, which, considering intermediate probabilities, 
amounts to a perpetuity.
