DEAR SIR, My last was on the 18th, and acknowledged yours 
of the 30th Ult. and 7th instant. I had not then time to mention that W. C. Nicholas passed an evening with me on his way 
home from his brother's, where he had met Edmund Randolph 
on his return to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. From his conversation, his sentiments are right and firm on the French Revolution, and in 
other respects I discovered no symptoms of heresy. He spoke 
particularly and emphatically of the unquestionable unanimity 
of the Country in favor of the cause of France. I have no doubt 
that he held this language to every one, and, consequently, that 
the impressions depending on him have been rightly made. I 
could not but infer from all that he said with regard to Ed. 
Randolph that he considered the sentiments of him on French 
affairs as similar to his own, and to such as were expressed by 
himself. Some allowance, however, in all such conversations, 
must be made for the politeness or policy of respecting the 
known sentiments of the party to which they are addressed or 
communicated. He had seen the first part of Hamilton's publication, and spoke of it as from that quarter. He expressed 
some surprise at the doctrines and cabinet efforts of the author, 
as he had learnt them from B. Randolph, and seemed unable to 
account for some things without suspecting Hamilton of a secret 
design to commit and sacrifice the President. His ideas on this 
subject must have grown out of the language of E. Randolph, if 
not actually copied from it.

I have read over, with some attention, the printed papers you 
inclosed, and have made notes towards a discussion of the subject. I find myself, however, under some difficulties: first, from 
my not knowing how far concessions have been made on particular points behind the curtain. 2 dly . From my not knowing how 
far the President considers himself as actually committed with 
respect to some doctrines. 3 dly . From the want of some lights 
from the law of nations as applicable to the construction of the 
Treaty. 4 th . From my ignorance of some material facts, such 
as whether any call was made by Great Britain, or any other 
Belligerent power, for the intentions of the United States prior 
to the proclamation; whether France was heard on the subject 
of her constructions and pretensions under the Treaty; whether 
the Executive had before them any authentic documents, or entered into any discussions on the question whether the war between France and Great Britain is offensive or defensive, &c. 
</p><p>
I do not mean that all such information ought to be brought 
into the controversy, though some of it is necessary, and some 
more might be used to advantage. But all or most of it seems 
proper, in order to avoid vulnerable asserv.ons or suppositions, 
which might give occasion to triumphant replies. If an answer 
to the publication be undertaken, it ought to be both a solid and 
a prudent one. None but intelligent readers will enter into 
such a controversy, and to their minds it ought principally to 
be accommodated. If you can lay your hands on the explanatory publication of the real object of the Proclamation referred 
to in your last, or the preceding one, send it to me. The one I 
had is no longer in my hands. I expect to-day to receive your 
letter next in date to the 7th.
