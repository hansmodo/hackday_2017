DEAR SIR,
I am sorry the development of the interesting subject before Congress had so little effect on the members. I did not see <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='contact'>General St. Clair</a>, and if I had, my acquaintance is too slender 
to have warranted my broaching a conversation with him. I have conferred freely with Mr. Wilson. What his ultimate opinion may be on a full view of the measure in its details, I 
cannot say. I think he is not unaware of strong objections against it, particularly as it tends to defeat the object of the 
meeting at <a href="/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>, from which he has great expectations. 
</p>
