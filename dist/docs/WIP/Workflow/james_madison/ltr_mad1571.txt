DEAR SIR, Monday last was the day for the meeting of the 
Convention. The number as yet assembled is but small. Among 
the few is <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>, who arrived on Sunday evening, 
amidst the acclamations of the people, as well as more sober 
marks of the aifection and veneration which continues to be 
felt for his character. The Governor, Messrs. Wythe and Blair, 
and Doctor McClurg, are also here. Col. Mason is to be here 
in a day or two. There is a prospect of a pretty full meeting 
on the whole, though there is less punctuality in the outset than 
was to be wished. Of this the late bad weather has been the 
principal cause. I mention these circumstances because it is 
possible this may reach you before you hear from me through 
any other channel, and I add no others because it is merely 
possible.
