DEAR SIR, Being informed of a circuitous opportunity to 
France, I make use of it to forward the inclosures. By one of 
them you will find that Congress have been at length brought 
into the true policy which is demanded by the situation of the 
Western country. An additional resolution on the secret 
journal puts an end to all negociation with Spain, referring the 
subject of a treaty, after this asserv.on of right to the Mississippi, to the new Government. The communication in my last 
will have shown you the crisis of things in that quarter, a 
crisis, however, not particularly known to Congress, and will 
be a key to some of the Kentucky toasts in the Virginia Gazette. 
</p><p>
The circular letter from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> Convention has rekindled an ardor among the opponents of the federal Constitution for an immediate revision of it by another General Convention. You will find in one of the papers inclosed the result 
of the consultations in Pennsylvania on that subject. Mr 
Henry and his friends in Virginia enter with great zeal into the 
scheme. Governor Randolph also espouses it, but with a wish 
to prevent, if possible, danger to the article which extends the 
power of the Government to internal as well as external taxation. It is observ.le that the views of the Pennsylvania 
meeting do not rhyme very well with those of the Southern 
advocates for a Convention; the objects most eagerly pursued 
by the latter being unnoticed in the Harrisburg proceedings 
The effect of the circular letter on other States is less known, 
I conclude that it will be the same everywhere among those 
who opposed the Constitution, or contended for a conditional 
ratification of it. 
</p><p>
Whether an early Convention will be the result of this 
united effort is more than can at this moment be foretold. Tha 
measure will certainly be industriously opposed in some parts 
of the Union, not only by those who wish for no alterations, 
but by others who would prefer the other mode provided in the 
Constitution as most expedient, at present, for introducing 
those supplemental safeguards to liberty against which no objections can be raised; and who would, moreover, approve of a 
Convention for amending the frame of the Government itself, 
as soon as time shall have somewhat corrected the feverish 
state of the public mind, and trial have pointed its attention to 
the true defects of the system. 
</p><p>
You will find, also, by one of the papers inclosed, that the 
arrangements have been compleated for bringing the new Government into action. The dispute concerning the place of its 
meeting was the principal cause of delay; the Eastern States, 
with New Jersey and South Carolina, being attached to New 
York, and the others strenuous for a more central position. 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, Wilmington, Lancaster, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, were successively tendered without effect by the latter, before they 
finally yielded to the superiority of members in favor of this 
city. I am afraid the decision will give a great handle to the 
Southern anti-federalists, who have inculcated a jealousy of this 
end of the continent. It is to be regretted, also, as entailing 
this pernicious question on the new Congress, who will have 
enough to do in adjusting the other delicate matters submitted 
to them. Another consideration of great weight with me is, 
that the temporary residence here will probably end in a permanent one at Trenton, or, at the farthest, on the Susquehannah. 
A removal in the first instance beyond the Delaware would have 
removed the alternative to the Susquehannah and the Potowmac. The best chance of the latter depends on a delay of the 
permanent establishment for a few years, until the Western and 
South Western population comes more into view. This delay 
cannot take place if so excentric a place as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> is to be 
the intermediate seat of business. 
</p><p>
To the other papers is added a little pamphlet on the Mohegan language. The observ.ions deserv.the more attention as 
they are made by a man of known learning and character, and 
may aid researches into the primitive structure of language, as 
well as those on foot for comparing the American tribes with 
those on the Eastern frontier of the other continent.

In consequence of your letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a> on the subject of 
" outfit," &c., I had a conference with him, and he agreed to 
suggest the matter to Congress. This was done, and his letter 
referred back to be reported on. The idea between us was, 
that the reference should be to a Committee. His letter coming 
in at a moment when I happened to be out, it was, as in course, 
referred to his department. His answer suggested, that as he 
might be thought eventually concerned in the question, it was 
most proper for the consideration of a Committee. I had discovered that he was not struck with the peculiarities of your 
case, even when insinuated to him. How far the Committee 
will be so is more than I can yet say. In general, I have no 
doubt that both it and Congress are well disposed. But it is 
probable that the idea of a precedent will beget much caution, 
and, what is worse, there is little probability of again having a 
quorum of States for the business.
