DEAR SIR, The daily Advertiserv.f this date contains several important articles of information, which need only to be 
referred to. I enclose it, with a few other late papers. Neither 
French nor English packet is yet arrived, and the present 
weather would prevent their getting in if they should be on the 
coast. I have heard nothing of consequence from Massachusetts 
since my last. The accounts from New Hampshire continue to 
be as favorable as could be wished. From South Carolina we 
get no material information. A letter from Georgia of the 25th 
of December says that the Convention was getting together at 
Augusta, and that everything wore a federal complexion. 
North Carolina, it seems, has been so complaisant to Virginia 
as to postpone her Convention 'till July. We are without a 
Congress. 
</p><p>
With perfect esteem and attachment, I remain, Dear Sir, your 
most obed' humble serv.t.
