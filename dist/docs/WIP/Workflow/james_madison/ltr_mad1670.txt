DEAR SIR, Your recommendation of Doctor M was handed me some time ago. I need not tell you that I shall 
always rely on your vouchers for merit, or that I shall equally be pleased with opportunities of forwarding your wishes.

The only act of much consequence which the present Session 
has yet produced is one for enumerating the Inhabitants, as the 
basis of a reapportionment of the Representation. The House 
of Representatives has been chiefly employed of late on the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury. As it has been printed 
in all the Newspapers, I take for granted that it must have 
fallen under your eye. The plan which it proposes is in general well-digested, and illustrated and supported by very able 
reasoning. It has not, however, met with universal concurrence 
in every part. .1 have myself been of the number who could not 
suppress objections. I have not been able to persuade myself 
that the transactions between the United States and those whose 
serv.es were most instrumental in saving their country did, in 
fact, extinguish the claims of the latter on the justice of the 
former; or that there must not be something radically wrong in 
suffering those who rendered a bona fide consideration to lose 
| of their dues, and those who have no particular merit towards 
their country to gain 7 or 8 times as much as they advanced. 
In pursuance of this view of the subject, a proposition was made 
for redressing, in some degree, the inequality. After much discussion, a large majority was in the negative. The subject at 
present before a Committee of the whole is the proposed assumption of the State debts. On this, opinions seem to be pretty 
equally divided. Virginia is endeavoring to incorporate with 
the measure some effectual provision for a final settlement and 
payment of balances among the States. Even with this ingredient, the project will neither be just nor palatable if the assumption be referred to the present epoch, and by that means 
deprives the States who have done most of the benefit of their 
exertions. We have accordingly made an effort, but without 
success, to refer the assumption to the state of the debts at the 
close of the war. This would probably add ^ more to the 
amount of the debts, but would more than compensate for this 
by rendering the measure more just and satisfactory. A simple, 
unqualified assumption of the existing debts would bear peculiarly hard on Virginia. She has paid. I believe, a greater part 
of her quotas since the peace than Massachusetts. She suffered 
far more during the war. It is agreed that she will not be less 
a creditor on the final settlement; yet, if such an assumption 
were to take place, she would pay towards the discharge of the 
debts in the proportion of -- and receive back to her creditor citizens y or , whilst Massachusetts would pay not more than y or 
, and receive back not less than --. The case of South Carolina 
is a still stronger contrast. In answer to this inequality we 
are referred to the final liquidation, for which provision may be 
made. But this may possibly never take place. It will probably be at some distance. The payment of the balances among 
the States will be a fresh source of delay and difficulties. The 
merits of the plan, independently of the question of equity, are 
also controvertible, though on the other side there are advantages which have considerable weight.

We have no late information from Europe more than what 
the newspapers contain. France seems likely to carry through 
the great work in which she has been laboring. The Austrian 
Netherlands have caught the flame, and with arms in their hands 
have renounced the Government of the Emperor forever. Even 
the lethargy of Spain begins to awake at the voice of liberty, 
which is summoning her neighbors to its standard. All Europe 
must by degrees be aroused to the recollection and asserv.on of 
the rights of human nature. Your good will to mankind will 
be gratified with this prospect, and your pleasure as an American be enhanced by the reflection that the light which is chasing darkness and despotism from the old World is but an emanation from that which has procured and succeeded the establishment of liberty in the new.
