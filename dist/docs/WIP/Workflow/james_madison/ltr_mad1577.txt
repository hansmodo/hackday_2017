TO JAMES MADISON, SEN'R . 
</p><p>

HON D Sm, The Convention has not yet broken up, but its 
session will probably continue but a short time longer. Its 
proceedings are still under the injunction of secrecy. We hear 
that a spirit of insurrection has shown itself in the County of 
Green Briar. Some other Counties have been added by report 
as infected with the same spirit; but the silence of the
from <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> on thfe latter fact gives us hopes that the Report is not well founded. We understand, also, that the upper 
parts of the country have suffered extremely from the drought, 
and that the crops will not suffice for the subsistence of the inhabitants. I hope the account is exaggerated, and wait with 
some impatience for a confirmation of this hope. 
</p><p>
The crops of wheat in this quarter have been uncommonly 
fine, and the latter rains have been so seasonable for the corn 
that the prospect of that crop is tolerably good. The price of 
good Tobacco here at present is 40s., Virginia money. 
</p><p>
As soon as the tie of secrecy shall be dissolved I will forward 
the proceedings of the Convention. In the mean time, with my 
affectionate regards for all the family, 
</p><p>
I remain, your dutiful son. 
</p>
