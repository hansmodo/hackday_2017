DEAR SIR, When you get a sight of the resolution of the 
General Assembly, referred to in your favor of the 8th, you 
will readily judge from the tenor of it what steps would be 
taken by the Delegates. It necessarily submitted the fate of 
the object in question to the discretion and prospects of the 
gentleman whom reports, it seems, have arraigned to you, but 
who, I am bound in justice to testify, has entirely supported the 
character which he formerly held with you. I am somewhat 
surprised that you never had before known of the Resolution 
just mentioned, especially as, what is indeed much more surprising, it was both debated and passed with open doors and a 
full gallery. This circumstance alone must have defeated any 
reserv.ions attached to it. 
</p><p>
The N. York papers and the intelligence from thence make it 
evident that they have no hope of relieving Cornwallis, unless 
it can be effected by some desperate naval experiment, and that 
such an one will be made. Their force will probably amount 
to twenty-six sail of the line, and if we are not misinformed as 
to the late arrival of three ships of the line, to twenty-nine sail. 
The superiority still remaining on the part of our allies, and the 
repeated proofs given of their skill and bravery on the water, 
forbid any apprehension of danger. At the same time, we cannot help calculating that every addition to the British force 
proportionally diminishes the certainty of success. A fleet of 
</p><p>
provisions amounting to about sail, convoyed by a 
</p><p>
forty-four and two frigates, have arrived at N. Y. within the 
week past. 
</p><p>
Having sent all the papers containing the proceedings on the 
case of Mr. N. against Virga, as they came out, I shall, to complete your view of it, add the last effort in his favor published 
in the enclosed No. of the Freeman's Journal. I am told, however, that the publisher ought to have subjoined that the Privy 
Council interposed, and directed restitution of the King of 
Spain's effects. 
</p><p>
I am, Dr Sir, yrs affly.
