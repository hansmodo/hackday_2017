MY DEAR FRIEND, Your favour of the 17th inst., inclosing a 
letter from Mr. Jones and a copy of the ecclesiastical Journal, 
came safe to hand. If I do not dislike the contents of the latter, it is because they furnish, as I conceive, fresh and forcible 
arguments against the General Assessment. It may be of little 
consequence what tribunal is to judge of clerical misdemesnors 
o** !iow firmly the incumbent may be fastened on the parish, 
whilst the vestry and people may hear and pay him or not, as 
they like. But should a legal salary be annexed to the title, 
this phantom of power would be substantiated into a real monster of oppression. Indeed, it appears to be so at present as 
far as the Glebes and donations extend. I had seen some parcels of these proceedings before I received your letter, and had 
remarked the sprinklings of liberality to which you allude. 
My conjectures, I believe, did not err as to the quarter from 
which they came. 
</p><p>
The urgency of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> in the late negociation 
with Maryland makes it probable, I think, that he will feel 
some chagrin at the inattention to that with Pennsylvania, 
which has a much nearer connection with his favorite object, 
and was, moreover, suggested by himself. Shortly after the 
date of my last I dropped a few lines to Col. Mason, reminding 
him that some report will be expected from the Commissioners 
by the Assembly, as well as of the real importance of the business. I have not yet received any answer, and begin to suspect that my letter may have miscarried. Your information 
leads me to doubt whether he has ever been furnished with a 
copy of the Resolution under which he is to proceed. I will 
write to him again, and inclose one which Mr. Jones sent me. 
</p><p>
I have a letter from the Marquis, but dated as far back as 
March. It was accompanied with a Copy of a French memorial to the Emperor, which seems to have stifled the War in its 
birth; and an Extract from a late work of Mr. Neckar, which 
has made him the idol of one party in France and the execration of the other. To avoid the trouble of transcribing, I send 
them as they came to me. You can peruse and return them by 
my brother, who is the bearer of this, or by any future opportunity. The Marquis says he is doing all he can to forward our 
claim to the Mississippi; that the French Ministry understand 
the matter and are well disposed; but that they are apprehensive " Spain knows not how to give up what she once has." 
</p><p>
I had heard of the strictures on the incorporating Act, but 
without being able to pick up any of the papers in which they 
are published. I have desired my brother to search them out 
if he can. Perhaps you can refer him to the proper press and 
numbers. 
</p><p>
At the instance of Col. Nicholas, of Albemarle, I undertook 
the draught of the inclosed remonstrance against the General 
Assessment. Subscriptions to it are on foot, I believe, in sundry Counties, and will be extended to others. My choice is, 
that my name may not be associated with it. I am not sure 
that I know precisely your ideas on this subject; but were they 
more variant from mine than I take them to be, I should not be 
restrained from a confidential communication. 
</p><p>
I keep up my attention, as far as I can command my time, to 
the course of reading which I have of late pursued, and shall 
continue to do so. I am, however, far from being determined 
ever to make a professional use of it. My wish is, if possible, 
to provide a decent and independent subsistence, without encountering the difficulties which I foresee in that line. Another 
of my wishes is to depend as little as possible on the labour of 
slaves. The difficulty of reconciling these views has -brought 
into my thoughts several projects from which advantage seemed 
attainable. I have, in concert with a friend here, one at present on the anvil, which we think cannot fail to yield a decent 
reward for our trouble. Should we persist in it, it will cost 
me a ride to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, after which it will go on without my 
being ostensibly concerned. I forbear to particularize till I 
can do it ore tenus. Should I take this ride I may possibly continue it into the Eastern States; Col. Monroe having given me 
an invitation to take a ramble of curiosity this fall, which I 
have half a mind to accept, and among outher routes named 
this. I recollect that you talked yourself of a trip last spring 
as far as Lancaster. Have you laid it aside totally? Or will 
your domestic endearments forbid even the trip to Bath, from 
which I promised myself the happiness of taking you by the 
hand in <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>? Give my warmest respects to Mrs. Randolph, 
and be assured that I remain, with sincere affection, your 
friend. 
 
Was the Royal assent ever given to the act of <a href="/results.php?year=1769">1769</a>, entitled 
" an act to amend an act entitled, an act declaring the law concerning Executions and for relief of insolvent debtors."
