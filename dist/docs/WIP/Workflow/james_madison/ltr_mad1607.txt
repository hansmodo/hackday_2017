DEAR SIR, Your favor of came to hand by the mail 
</p><p>
of Wednesday. I did not write by several late returns for two 
reasons: one, the improbability of your having got back to Mount 
Vernon; the other, a bilious indisposition, which confined me 
for several days. I am again tolerably well recovered.

Appearances at present are less favorable than at the date 
of my last. Our progress is slow, and every advantage is taken 
of the delay to work on the local prejudices of particular sets 
of members. British debts, the Indiana claim, and the Mississippi, are the principal topics of private discussion and intrigue, 
as well as of public declamation. The members who have 
serv. in Congress have been dragged into communications on 
the last, which could not be justifiable on any other occasion, 
if on the present. There is reason to believe that the event 
may depend on the Kentucky members, who seem to lean more 
against than in favor of the Constitution. The business is in 
the most ticklish state that can be imagined. The majority will 
certainly be very small, on whatever side it may finally lie; and 
I dare not encourage much expectation that it will be on the 
favorable side.

Oswald, of <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, has been here with for the 
anti-federal leaders from <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and probably <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 
He staid a very short time here, during which he was occasionally closeted with H y, M-s-n, &c. I learn from <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> 
</p><p>
that the elections have proved adverse to the Constitution. 
Y'rs affect'y.
