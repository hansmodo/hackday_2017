DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 10th came to hand yesterday. 
I feel much anxiety for the situation in which you found Mrs. 
Randolph; but it is somewhat alleviated by the hopes which 
you seem to indulge.

The language of <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> on the proposed discrimination 
does not surprise me. It is the natural language of the towns, 
and decides nothing. Censure, I well knew, would flow from 
those sources. Should it also flow from other sources, I shall 
not be the less convinced of the right of the measure, or the 
less satisfied with myself for having proposed it. The conduct 
of the Gentlemen in Amherst and Culpeper proves only that 
their personal animosity is unabated. Here, it is a charge 
against me that I sacrificed the federal to anti-federal sentiments. 
I am at a loss to divine the use that C. and S. can make of the 
circumstance.

The debates occasioned by the Quakers have not yet expired. 
The stile of them has been as shamefully indecent as the matter 
was evidently misjudged. The true policy of the Southern 
members was to have let the affair proceed with as little noise 
as possible, and to have made use of the occasion to obtain, 
along with an asserv.on of the powers of Congress, a recognition of the restraints imposed by the Constitution.

The State debts have been suspended by the preceding business more than a week. They lose ground daily, and the 
assumption will, I think, ultimately be defeated. Besides a 
host of objections against the propriety of the measure in its 
present form, its practicability becomes less and less evident. 
The case of the paper money in Georgia, S. Carolina, N. Carolina, &c., to Rhode Island, is a most serv.us difficulty. It is a 
part of the debts of those States, and comes in part within the 
principle of the assumption.

A packet arrived a few days ago, but threw little light on the 
affairs of Europe. Those of France do not recede, but their 
advance does not keep pace with the wishes of liberty.
