</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 1st instant came safe to hand yesterday. The enclosed was sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel=''>Mr. Pendleton</a>, who is still in town. 
</p><p>
All we know of the several fleets in the American seas, is 
that Rodney with a few ships is at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, the remainder 
having joined Graves and Arbuthnot, whom we know nothing 
about. Ternay is still at Rhode Island. The main French 
fleet under Guichen left the West Indies about the time first 
mentioned, with a large fleet of merchantmen under its convoy, 
and has not since been heard of. The residue of the French 
fleet is in the West Indies, but we do not hear of their being 
any way employed. It is said an English expedition is preparing at Jamaica against some of the Spanish settlements. The 
Spanish expeditions against the Floridas I believe I mentioned 
in my last. 
</p><p>
We have private accounts, through a channel which has seldom deceived, that a very large embarkation is still going on 
at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. I hope Virginia will not be surprised, in case 
she should be the meditated victim. 
</p><p>
Andre was hung as a spy on the 2d instant. Clinton made 
a frivolous attempt to save him by pleading the passport granted 
by Arnold. He submitted to his fate in a manner that showed 
him to be worthy of a better one. His coadjutor, Smith, will 
soon follow him. The hero of the plot, although he may for the 
present escape an ignominious death, must lead an ignominious 
life, which, if any of his feelings remain, will be a sorer punishment. It is said that he is to be made a Brigadier, and employed in some predatory expedition against the Spaniards, in 
which he may gratify his thirst for gold. It is said with more 
probability, that his baseness is universally despised by those 
who have taken advantage of it, and that some degree of resentment is mixed with their contempt, on account of the loss of 
their darling officer, to which he was accessory. 
</p><p>
With sincere regard, I am, dear sir, your obedient, humble 
serv.t.
