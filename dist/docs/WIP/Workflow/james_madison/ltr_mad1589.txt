DEAR SIR, I am just informed by a Delegate from New 
Hampshire that he has a letter from President Sullivan, which 
tells him that the Legislature had unanimously agreed to call a 
Convention, as recommended, to meet in February. The second 
Wednesday is the day, if I have not mistaken it. We have no 
further information of much importance from Massachusetts. 
It appears that Cambridge, the residence of Mr. Gerry, has 
left him out of the choice for the Convention, and put in Mr. 
Dana, formerly Minister of the United States in Europe, and 
another gentleman, both of them firmly opposed to Mr. Gerry's 
politics. I observ. too, in a Massachusetts paper, that the 
omission of Col. Mason's objection with regard to commerce, in 
the first publication of his objections, has been supplied. This 
will more than undo the effect of the mutilated view of them. 
New Jersey, the newspapers tell us, has adopted the Constitution unanimously. Our European intelligence remains perfectly 
as it stood at the date of my last. 
</p><p>
With the most affectionate esteem and attachment, I am, D* 
Sir, your obt and very humble serv.
