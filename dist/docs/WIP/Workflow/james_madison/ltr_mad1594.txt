DEAR SIR, The eastern mail which arrived yesterday brought 
me a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. King</a>, of which a>copy follows: 
</p><p>
" Our prospects are gloomy, but hope is not entirely extinguished. Gerry has not returned to the Convention, and I think will not again be invited. We are now thinking of 
amendments to be submitted, not as a condition of our assent and ratification, but as the opinion of the Convention subjoined to their ratification. This scheme may gain a few members, but the issue is doubtful." 
</p><p>
In this case, as in the last, <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. King</a>'s information is accompanied with from other persons on the spot, which dwell more on the favorable side of the prospect. His anxiety on the 
subject may give a greater activity to his fears than to his hopes, and he would naturally lean to the cautious side. These 
circumstances encourage me to put as favorable a construction on his letter as it will bear. 
</p><p>
A vessel is arrived here from <a href="/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, which brings letters that speak with confidence of an adoption of the federal 
Constitution in that State, and make it very probable that Georgia had actually adopted it. Some from North Carolina speak a very equivocal language as to the prospect there. 
</p><p>
The French Packet arrived yesterday. As she has been out since early in November, little news can be expected by her. I have not yet got my, if there be any for me, and I have 
heard the contents of no others. 
</p><p>
I remain, Dear Sir, with the utmost respect and attachment, 
your affectionate serv.rt . 
</p>
