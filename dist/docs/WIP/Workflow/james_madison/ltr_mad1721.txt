DEAR Sir, 
Every Gazette I see (except that of the United States) exhibits a spirit of criticism on the Anglified complexion charged on 
the Executive politics. I regret extremely the position into 
which the President has been thrown. The unpopular cause of 
Anglomany is openly laying claim to him. His enemies, masking themselves under the popular cause of France, are playing 
off the most tremendous batteries on him. The proclamation 
was, in truth, a most unfortunate error. It wounds the national 
honor, by seeming to disregard the stipulated duties to France. 
It wounds the popular feelings, by a seeming indifference to the 
cause of liberty. And it seems to violate the forms and spirit 
of the Constitution, by making the Executive Magistrate the 
organ of the disposition, the duty, and the interest of the nation, 
in relation to war and peace subjects appropriated to other 
departments of the Government. It is mortifying to the real 
friends of the President that his fame and his influence should 
have been unnecessarily made to depend in any degree on political events in a foreign quarter of the Globe; and particularly 
so that he should have anything to apprehend from the success 
of liberty in another country, since he owes his pre-eminence to 
the success of it in his own. If France triumphs, the ill-fated 
proclamation will be a millstone, which would sink any other 
character, and will force a struggle even on his.
