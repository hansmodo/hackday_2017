DR Sm, I have your favor of the 5th instant by the post. 
Col. Harrison arrived here yesterday, and as he mentions no 
circumstance which indicated an intended departure of the enemy, I am afraid your intelligence on that subject was not well 
founded. Immediately on the receipt of your former letter, relating to an exchange of C. Taylor, I applied to the Admiralty 
Department, and if such a step can be brought about with 
propriety, I hope he will be gratified; but considering the 
tenor of their treatment of naval prisoners, and the resolutions 
with which it has inspired Congress, I do not think it probable 
that exchanges will go on easily; and if this were less the case, 
a mere passenger, under the indulgence, too, of a parole, can 
scarcely hope to be preferred to such as are suffering the utmost 
hardships, and even made prisoners in public serv.e.

A vessel arrived here a few days ago from Cadiz, which 
brings of as late date as the last of December. Those 
that are official tell us that England is making the most strenuous exertions for the current year, and that she is likely to be 
but too successful in the great article of money. The Parliament have voted 32,000 seamen; and a considerable land reinforcement for their southern army in America is also said to be 
in preparation.

Private by the same conveyance mention that the 
blockade of Gibraltar is going on with alacrity, and that the 
garrison is in such distress as flatters the hope of a speedy 
capitulation.

If <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel=''>Mr. Pendleton</a>, your nephew, is still with you, be pleased 
to return him my compliments. 
</p><p>
With great respect, I am, Dr sir, your obedient serv.t.
