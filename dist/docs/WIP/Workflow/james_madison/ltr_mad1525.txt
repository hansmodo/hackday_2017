<a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>, August 20th, <a href="/results.php?year=1785">1785</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Yours of the 18th of March never reached me 
till the 4th instant. It came by post from <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, which it 
did not leave till the 21 of July. My last was dated in April, 
and went by Mr. Mazzei, who picked it up at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and 
promised to deliver it with his own hand. 
</p><p>
The machinations of Great Britain, with regard to commerce, 
have produced much distress and noise in the Northern States, 
particularly in <a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, from whence the alarm has spread to 
<a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. Your correspondence with Congress will no doubt have furnished you with full information on 
this head. I only know the general fact, and that the sufferers 
are everywhere calling for such augmentation of the power of 
Congress as may effect relief. How far the Southern States, 
and Virginia in particular, will join in this proposition, cannot 
be foreseen. It is easy to foresee that the circumstances which, 
in a confined view, distinguish our situation from that of our 
brethren, will be laid hold of by the partizans of Great Britain, 
by those who are or affect to be jealous of Congress, and those 
who are interested in the present course of business, to give a 
wrong bias to our councils. If anything should reconcile Virginia to the idea of giving Congress a power over her trade, it 
will be that this power is likely to annoy Great Britain, against 
whom the animosities of our citizens are still strong. They 
seem to have less sensibility to their commercial interests, which 
they very little understand, and which the mercantile class here 
have not the same motives, if they had the same capacity, to lay 
open to the public, as that class have in the States North of us. 
</p><p>
The price of our Staple since the peace is another cause of 
inattention in the planters to the dark side of our commercial 
affairs. Should these or any other causes prevail in frustrating 
the scheme of the Eastern and Middle States of a general retaliation on Great Britain, I tremble for the event. A majority 
of the States, deprived of a regular remedy for their distresses 
by the want of a federal spirit in the minority, must feel the 
strongest motives to some irregular experiments. The danger 
of such a crisis makes me surmise that the policy of Great 
Britain results as much from the hope of effecting a breach in 
our Confederacy as of monopolizing our trade. 
</p><p>
Our internal trade is taking an arrangement from which I 
hope good consequences. Retail Stores are spreading all over 
the Country; many of them carried on by native adventurers, 
some of them branched out from the principal Stores at the 
heads of navigation. The distribution of the business, however, 
into the importing and the retail departments, has not yet taken 
place. Should the port bill be established, it will, I think, 
quickly add this amendment, which indeed must in a little time 
follow of itself. It is the more to be wished for, as it is the 
only radical cure for credit to the consumer, which continues to 
be given to a degree which, if not checked, will turn the diffusive retail of Merchandize into a nuisance. When the Shopkeeper buys his goods of the wholesale Merchant, he must buy 
at so short a credit that he can venture to give none at all. 
</p><p>
You ask me to unriddle the dissolution of the Committee of 
the States at <a href="/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>. I am not sure that I am myself possessed fully of the causes, different members of Congress having 
differed in their accounts of the matter. My conception of it 
is, that the abrupt departure of some of the Eastern delegates, 
which destroyed the quorum, and which Dana is said to have 
been at the bottom of, proceeded partly from irritations among 
the committee, partly from dislike to the place of their session, 
and partly from an impatience to get home, which prevailed 
over their regard for their private characters, as well as for 
their public duty. 
</p><p>
Subsequent to the date of mine in which I gave my idea of <a href="/results.php?tla=laf" rel="acquaintance colleague met">Fayette</a>, I had further opportunities of penetrating his character. Though his foibles did not disappear, all the favorable 
traits presented themselves in a stronger light on closer inspection. He certainly possesses talents which might figure in any 
line. If he is ambitious, it is rather of the praise which virtue dedicates to merit, than of the homage which fear renders to power; his disposition is naturally warm and affectionate, and 
his attachment to the United States unquestionable. Unless I am grossly deceived, you will find his zeal sincere and useful, whenever it can be employed in behalf of the United States 
without opposition to the essential interests of France. 
</p><p>
The opposition to the General Assessment gains ground. At 
the instance of some of its adversaries, I drew up the remonstrance herewith inclosed. It has been sent through the medium of confidential persons in a number of the upper Counties, 
and I am told will be pretty extensively signed. The Presbyterian clergy have at length espoused the side of the opposition, 
being moved either by a fear of their laity or a jealousy of the 
Episcopalians. The mutual hatred of these sects has been much 
inflamed by the late act incorporating the latter. I am far from 
being sorry for it, as a coalition between them could alone endanger our religious rights, and a tendency to such an event 
had been suspected. The fate of the Circuit Courts is uncertain. 
They are threatened with no small danger from the diversity 
of opinions entertained among the friends of some reform in 
that department. But the greatest danger is to be feared from 
those who mask a secret aversion to any reform under a zeal 
for such a one as they know will be rejected. The Potowmac 
Company are going on with very flattering prospects. Their 
subscriptions some time ago amounted to upward of four-fifths 
of the whole sum. I have the pleasure, also, to find, by an advertisement from the managers for James River, that more than 
half the sum is subscribed for that undertaking, and that the 
subscribers are to meet, shortly for the purpose of organizing 
themselves and going to work. I despair of seeing the Revisal 
taken up at the ensuing session. The number of copies struck 
are so deficient, (there being not above three for each County,) 
and there has been such delay in distributing them, (none of the 
Counties having received them till very lately, and some probably not yet, though they were ready long ago,) that the principal end. of their being printed has been frustrated. 
</p><p>
Our fields promise very short crops both of corn and Tobacco. 
The latter was much injured by the grasshopper and other insects; the former, somewhat by the bug in the southern parts of 
the State; but both have suffered most from dry weather, which 
prevails at present in this part of the country, and has generally 
prevailed, I understand, in most other parts. It seems certain 
that no future weather can make a great crop of either, particularly of Tobacco, so great a proportion of the hills being 
without plants in them, and so many more with plants in them 
which must come to nothing. Notwithstanding this prospect, 
its price has fallen from 36s. to 30s. on James River, and 28s. 
on Rappahannock. The scarcity of cash is one cause. 
</p><p>
Harrison, late Governor, was elected in Surrey, whither he 
previously removed with his family. A contest for the chair 
will no doubt ensue; should he fail, he will be for Congress. 
</p><p>
I have not yet received any of the books which you have been 
so kind as to pick up for me, but expect their arrival daily, as 
you were probably soon after the date of your last apprised 
that I was withdrawn from the nomination, which led you to 
suspend the forwarding them. I am invited by Col. Monroe to 
an option of rambles this fall, one of which is into the Eastern 
States. I wish much to accept so favorable an opportunity of 
executing the plan from which I was diverted last fall, but cannot decide with certainty whether it will be practicable or not. 
1 have, in conjunction with a friend here, a project of interest 
on the anvil, which will carry me at least as far as Phil* or NewYork, where I shall be able to take my final resolution. 
Adieu. Yrs sincerely.
