DEAR SIR, I received yesterday your favor of the 2nd instant, which makes the third for which my acknowledgments 
are due. The progression which a certain measure seems to be 
making is an alarming proof of the predominance of temporary 
and partial interests over those just and extended maxims of 
policy which have been so much boasted of among us, and 
which alone can effectuate the durable prosperity of the Union. 
Should the measure triumph under the patronage of nine States, 
or even of the whole thirteen, I shall never be convinced that 
it is expedient, because I cannot conceive it to be just. 
</p><p>
There is no maxim, in my opinion, which is more liable to be 
misapplied, and which, therefore, more needs elucidation, than 
the current one, that the interest of the majority is the political 
standard of right and wrong. Taking the word "interest" as 
synonymous with " ultimate happiness," in which sense it is 
qualified with every necessary moral ingredient, the proposition 
is no doubt true. But taking it in the popular sense, as referring to immediate augmentation of property and wealth, nothing 
can be more false. In the latter sense, it would be the interest 
of the majority in every community to despoil and enslave the 
minority of individuals; and in a federal community, to make a 
similar sacrifice of the minority of the component States. In 
fact, it is only re-establishing, under another name and a more 
specious form, force as the measure of right; and in this light 
the Western settlements will infallibly view it.
