DEAR SIR, My last was of March 18, since which I have 
been favored with yours of the 8 and 9th of February. Bancroft's application in favour of Paradise, inclosed in the latter, 
shall be attended to as far as the case will admit, though I see 
not how any relief can be obtained. If Mr. Paradise stands on 
the list of foreign creditors, his agent here may probably convert his securities into money without any very great loss, as 
they rest on good funds, and the principal is in a course of payment. If he stands on the domestic list, as I presume he does, 
the interest only is provided for, and, since the postponement of 
the taxes, even that cannot be negociated without a discount of 
10 per cent., at least. The principal cannot be turned into cash 
without sinking three-fourths of its amount. 
</p><p>
Your notes having got into print in France, will inevitably 
be translated back and published in that form, not only in England but in America, unless you give out the original. I think, 
therefore, you owe it not only to yourself, but to the place you 
occupy and the subjects you have handled, to take this precaution. To say nothing of the injury which will certainly result 
to the diction from a translation first into French and then 
back into English, the ideas themselves may possibly be so perverted as to lose their propriety. 
</p><p>
The books which you have been so good as to forward to me 
are so well assorted to my wishes that no suggestions are necessary as to your future purchases. A copy of the old edition 
of the Encyclopedia is desirable, for the reasons you mention; 
but as I should gratify my desire in this particular at the expence of something else which I can less dispense with, I must 
content myself with the new Edition for the present. The 
watch I bought in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, though a pretty good one, is 
probably so far inferior to those of which you have a sample 
that I cannot refuse your kind offer to procure me one of the 
same sort; and I am. fancying to myself so many little gratifications from the pedometer that I cannot forego that addition. 
</p><p>
The inscription for the Statue is liable to Houdon's criticism, 
and is in every respect inferior to the substitute which you 
have copied into your letter. I am apprehensive, notwithstanding, that no change can be effected. The Assembly will want 
some proper ground for resuming the matter. The devices for 
the other side of the pedestal are well chosen, and might, I 
should suppose, be applied without scruple as decorations of the 
artist. I counted, myself, on the addition of proper ornaments, 
and am persuaded that such a liberty could give offence nowhere. 
</p><p>
The execution of your hints with regard to the Marquis and 
Rochambeau would be no less pleasing to me than to you. I 
think with you, also, that the setting up the busts of our own 
worthies would not be doing more honour to them than to ourselves. I foresee, however, the difficulty of overcoming the 
popular objection against every measure which involves expence, 
particularly where the importance of the measure will be felt by 
a few only; and an unsuccessful attempt would be worse than 
no attempt. I have heard nothing as to the Capitol. I mentioned to you in my last that I had written to the Attorney on 
the subject. 1 shall have an opportunity shortly of touching on 
it again to him. 
</p><p>
A great many changes have taken place in the late elections. 
The principal acquisitions are Col. G. Mason, who, I am told, 
was pressed into the serv.e at the instigation of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>, General Nelson, Mann Page. In Albemarle, both the 
old ones declined the task. Their successors are George and 
John Nicholas. Col. Carter was again an unsuccessful candidate. I have not heard how <a href='/results.php?tla=beh' rel='colleague'>Mr. Harrison</a> has shaped his course. 
It was expected that he would stand in a very awkward relation both to Charles City and to Surrey, and would probably 
succeed in neither. Monroe lost his election in King George 
by 6 votes. Mercer did his by the same number in Stafford. 
Neither of them was present, or they would, no doubt, have 
both been elected. Col. Bland is also to be among us. Among 
the many good things which may be expected from Col. Mason, 
we may reckon, perhaps, an effort to review our Constitution. 
The loss of the port bill will certainly be one condition on 
which we are to receive his valuable assistance. I am not without fears, also, concerning his federal ideas. The last time I 
saw him he seemed to have come about a good deal towards 
the policy of giving Congress the management of trade. But 
he has been led so far out of the right way that a thorough return can scarcely be hoped for. On all the other great points, 
the Revised Code, the Assize bill, taxation, paper money, &c., 
his abilities will be inestimable. 
</p><p>
Most if not all the States, except Maryland, have appointed 
deputies for the proposed Convention at <a href="/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>. The refusal of Maryland to appoint proceeded, as I am informed by Mr. 
Daniel Carroll, from a mistaken notion that the measure would 
derogate from the authority of Congress, and interfere with the 
Revenue system of April, <a href="/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>, which they have lately recommended anew to the States. There is certainly no such interference, and instead of lessening the authority of Congress, the 
object of the Convention is to extend it over commerce. I have 
no doubt that on a reconsideration of the matter it will be 
viewed in a different light. 
</p><p>
The internal situation of this State is growing worse and 
worse. Our specie has vanished. The people are again plunged 
in debt to the Merchants, and these circumstances, added to the 
fall of Tobacco in Europe and a probable combination among 
its chief purchaserv.here, have reduced that article to 20s. The 
price of Corn is, in many parts of the Country, at 20s. and upwards per barrel. In this part it is not more than 15s. Our 
spring has been a cool and, latterly, a dry one; of course it is a 
backward one. The first day of April was the most remarkable ever experienced in this climate. It snowed and hailed 
the whole day in a storm from N. E., and the Thermometer 
stood at 4 o'clock P. M. at 26. If the snow had fallen in the 
usual way it would have been 8 or 10 inches deep, at least; but 
consisting of small hard globules, mixed with small hail, and 
lying on the ground so compact and firm as to bear a man, it 
was less than half of that depth. 
</p><p>
We hear from Kentucky that the inhabitants are still at 
variance with their savage neighbours. In a late skirmish several were lost on both sides. On that of the whites Col. W. 
Christian is mentioned. It is said the scheme of independence 
is growing unpopular since the act of our Assembly has brought 
the question fully before them. Your nephew, Dabney Carr, 
has been some time at the Academy in Prince Edward. The 
President, Mr. Smith, speaks favorably of him. 
With the sincerest affection, I remain, dear sir, your friend 
and serv.t. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have taken measures for procuring the Peccan nuts, 
and the seed of the sugar Tree. Are there no other things here 
which would be acceptable on a like account? You will withhold from me a real pleasure if you do not favor me with your 
commands freely. Perhaps some of our animal curiosities would 
enable you to gratify particular characters of merit. I can, 
without difficulty, get the skins of all our common and of some 
of our rarer quadrupeds, and can have them stuffed, if desired. 
It is possible, also, that I may be able to send some of them 
alive. I lately had on hand a female opossum, with seven young 
ones, which I intended to have reared, for the purpose partly of 
experiments myself, and partly of being able to forward them 
to you in case of an opportunity, and your desiring it. Unfortunately, they Ixive all died. But I find they can be got at any 
time, almost, in the spring of the year, and if the season be too 
far advanced now, they may certainly be had earlier in the next 
spring. 
</p><p>
I observ.that in your notes you number the fallow and Roedeer among the native quadrupeds of America. As Buffon had 
admitted the fact, it was, whether true or erroneous, a good argument, no doubt, against him. But I am persuaded they are 
not natives of the new continent. Buffon mentions the chevruel, in particular, as abounding in Louisiana. I have enquired 
of several credible persons who have traversed the western 
woods extensively, and quite down to New Orleans, all of whom 
affirm that no other than our common deer are any where seen. 
Nor can I find any written evidence to the contrary that deserv. notice. You have, I believe, justly considered our Monax as the Marmotte of Europe. I have lately had an opportunity of examining a female one with some attention. Its 
weight, after it had lost a good deal of blood, was 5| Ibs. Its 
dimensions, shape, teeth, and structure within, as far as I could 
judge, corresponded in substance with the description given by 
D'Aubenton. In sundry minute circumstances a precise correspondence was also observ.le. The principal variations 
were: 1", in the face, which was shorter in the Monax than in 
the proportions of the Marmotte, and was less arched about the 
root of the nose. 2 ud , in the feet, each of the forefeet having a 
fifth nail, about | of an inch long, growing out of the inward 
side of the heel, without any visible toe. From this particular 
it would seem to be the Marmotte of Poland, called the Bobac, 
rather than the Alpine Marmotte. 3 rd , in the teats, which were 
8 only. The marmotte in Buifon had 10. 4 th , in several circumstances of its robe, particularly of that of the belly, which consisted of a short, coarse, thin hair, whereas this part of Buffon's 
marmotte was covered with a thicker fur than the back, &c. 
</p><p>
A very material circumstance in the comparison remains to 
be ascertained. The European Marmotte is in the class of those 
which are dormant during the winter. No person here of whom 
I have enquired can decide whether this be a quality of the 
Monax. I infer that it is of the dormant class, not only from 
its similitude to the Marmotte in other respects, but from the 
sensible coldness of the Monax I examined, compared with the 
human body, although the vital heat of quadrupeds is said, in 
general, to be greater than that of man. This inferiority of 
heat being a characteristic of animals which become torpid 
from cold, I should consider it as deciding the quality of the 
Monax in this respect, were it not that the subject of my examination, though it remained alive several days, was so crippled 
and apparently dying the whole time, that its actual heat could 
not fairly be taken for the degree of its natural heat. If it had 
recovered, I intended to have made a trial with the Thermometer. I now propose to have, if I can, one of their habitations 
discovered during the summer, and to open it on some cold day 
next winter. This will fix the matter. There is another circumstance which belongs to a full comparison of the two animals. The Marmotte of Europe is said to be an inhabitant of 
the upper region of mountains only. Whether our Monax be 
confined to mountainous situations or not, I have not yet learnt. 
If it be not found as a permanent inhabitant of the level country, it certainly descends occasionally into the plains which are 
in the neighborhood of mountains. 
</p><p>
I also compared, a few days ago, one of our moles with the 
male one described in Buffon. It weighed 2 ounces 11 pen 48 . 
Its length, the end of its snout to the root of the tail, was 5 
inches 3 lines, English measure. That described in Buffon was 
not weighed, I believe. Its length was 5 inches, French measure. The external and internal correspondence seemed to be 
too exact for distinct species. There was a difference, nevertheless, in two circumstances, one of which is not unworthy of 
notice, and the other of material consequence in the comparison. The first difference was in the tail, that of the mole here 
being 10| English lines only in the length, and naked, whereas 
that of Buffon's mole was 14 French lines in length, and covered 
with hair. If the hair was included in the latter measure, the 
difference in the length ought scarcely to be noticed. The second difference lay in the teeth. The mole in Buffon had 44. 
That which I examined had but 33; one of those on the left side 
of the upper jaw, and next to the principal cutters, was so small 
as to be scarcely visible to the natural eye, and had no corresponding tooth on the opposite side. Supposing this defect of a 
corresponding tooth to be accidental, a difference of ten teeth 
still remains. 
</p><p>
If these circumstances should not be thought to invalidate 
the identity of species, the mole will stand as an exception to 
the Theory which supposes no animal to be common to the two 
continents which cannot bear the cold of the region where they 
join, since, according to Buffon, this species of mole is not found 
"dans les climats froids ou la terre est glace pendant la plus 
grande partie de Tannee," and it cannot be suspected of such a 
journey during a short summer as would head the sea which 
separates the two continents. I suspect that several of our 
quadrupeds which are not peculiar to the new continent will 
be found to be exceptions to this Theory, if the mole should 
not. The Marmotte itself is not an animal taken notice of very 
far to the north, and as it moves slowly, and is deprived of its 
locomotive powers altogether by cold, cannot be supposed to 
have travelled the road which leads from the old to the New 
World. It is, perhaps, questionable whether any of the dormant animals, if any such be really common to Europe and 
America, can have emigrated from one to the other. 
</p><p>
I have thought that the cuts of the Quadrupeds in Buffon, if 
arranged in frames, would make both an agreeable and instructive piece of wall furniture. What would be the cost of them 
in such a form? I suppose they are not to be had coloured to 
the life, and would, besides, be too costly. What is the pries 
of Buffon's birds, colored?
