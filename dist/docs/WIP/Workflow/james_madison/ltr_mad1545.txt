DEAR SIR, I have your favor of the 14th inst. The expedient of which you ask my opinion has received, as it deserv., all the 
f "It has occurred to <a href='/results.php?tla=wlg' rel='acquaintance co-worker met'>Grayson</a> and myself to propose to Congress that negociations be carried on with Spain upon the following principles : 1. That exports 
be admitted through the Mississippi to some free port, perhaps New Orleans, to 
pay there a toll to Spain of about 3 per centum ad valorem, and to be carried 
thence under the regulations of Congress. 2. That imports shall pass into the 
western Country through the ports of the United States only. 3. That this sacrifice be given up to obtain in other respects a beneficial treaty." Extract from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='acquaintance co-worker'>Mr. Monroe</a>'s letter referred to. 
consideration which the time and other circumstances would 
allow me to give. I think that, in the present state of things, 
such an arrangement would be beneficial, and even pleasing to 
those most concerned in it; and yet I doubt extremely the policy of your proposing it to Congress. The objections which 
occur to me are: 1. That if the temper and views of Congress 
be such as you apprehend, it is morally certain they would not 
enter into the accommodation. Nothing, therefore, would be 
gained, and you would have to combat under the disadvantage of 
having forsaken your first ground. 2. If Congress should adopt 
your expedient as a ground of negociation with Guardoqui, and 
the views of Spain be such as they must be apprehended to be, 
it is still more certain that it would be rejected on that side, 
especially under the flattering hopes which the spirit of concession in Congress must have raised. In this event, the patrons 
of the measure now before Congress would return to it with 
greater eagerness and with fresh arguments, drawn from the 
impossibility of making better terms, and from the relaxation 
into which their opponents will have been betrayed. It is even 
possible that a foresight of this event might induce a politic 
concurrence in the experiment.

Your knowledge of all circumstances will make you a better 
judge of the solidity or fallacy of these reflections than I can 
be. I do not extend them because it would be superfluous, as 
well as because it might lead to details which could not prudently be committed to the mail without the guard of a cypher. 
Not foreseeing that any confidential communication on paper 
would happen between us during my absence from Virginia, I 
did not bring mine with me.
