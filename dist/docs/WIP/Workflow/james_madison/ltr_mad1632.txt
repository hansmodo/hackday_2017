Your book, as I prophesied, sells nowhere but in Virginia. 
A very few copies only have been called for either in <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> 
or in this city. The language in which it is written will account for it. In order to attract notice, I translated the panegyric in the French Mercure, and had it made part of the advertisement. I did not translate the comment on the Federal 
Constitution, as you wished, because I could not spare the time, 
as well as because I did not approve the tendency of it. Some 
of your remarks prove that Horace's " Ccelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt" does not hold without exception. 
In Europe, the abuses of power continually before your eyes 
have given a bias to your political reflections which you did 
not feel in equal degree when you left America, and which you 
would feel less of if you had remained in America. Philosophers on the old continent, in their zeal against tyranny, would 
rush into anarchy; as the horrors of superstition drive them 
into Atheism. Here, perhaps, the inconveniences of relaxed 
government have reconciled too many to the opposite extreme. 
If your plan of a single Legislature, as in Pennsylvania, <fcc., 
were adopted, I sincerely believe that it would prove the most 
deadly blow ever given to Republicanism. Were I an enemy 
to that form, I would preach the very doctrines which are 
preached by the enemies to the government proposed for the 
United States. Many of our best citizens are disgusted with 
the injustice, instability, and folly, which characterize the American Administrations. The number has for some time been rapidly increasing. Were the evils to be much longer protracted, 
the disgust would seize citizens of every description.

It is of infinite importance to the cause of liberty to ascertain 
the degree of it which will consist with the purposes of society. 
An error on one side may be as fatal as on the other. Hitherto, 
the error in the United States has lain in the excess. 
</p><p>
All the States except North Carolina and Rhode Island have 
ratified the proposed Constitution. Seven of them have ap-j, 
pointed their Senators, of whom those of Virginia, <a href='/results.php?tla=rhl' rel='co-worker'>R. H. Lee</a> 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=wlg' rel='acquaintance co-worker met'>Col. Grayson</a>, alone are among the opponents of the system. 
The appointments of Maryland, South Carolina, and Georgia, 
will pretty certainly be of the same stamp with the majority. 
The House of Representatives is yet to be chosen everywhere 
except in Pennsylvania. From the partial returns received, 
the election will wear a federal aspect, unless the event in one 
or two particular counties should contradict every calculation. 
If the eight members from this State be on the side of the Constitution, it will in a manner secure the majority in that branch 
of the Congress also. The object of the Anti-Federalists is to 
bring about another general Convention, which would either 
agree on nothing, as would be agreeable to some, and throw 
everything into confusion, or expunge from the Constitution 
parts which are held by its friends to be essential to it. The 
latter party are willing to gratify their opponents with every 
supplemental provision for general rights, but insist that this 
can be better done in the mode provided for amendments. 
I remain, with great sincerity, your friend and serv.t.
