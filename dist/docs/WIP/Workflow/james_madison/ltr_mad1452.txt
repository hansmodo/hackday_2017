TO MR. JAMES MADISON SR. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=nassau hall" rel="place">NASSAU HALL</a>., July 23, <a href="/results.php?year=1770">1770</a>. 
</p><p>
HONORED SIR, 
</p><p>
We have no public news but the base conduct of the merchants in <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> in breaking through their spirited resolutions not to import; a distinct account of which I suppose will 
be in the Virginia Gazette before this arrives. Their letter to 
the merchants in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> requesting their concurrence, was 
lately burnt by the students of this place in the college yard, all 
of them appearing in their black gowns, and the bell tolling. 
</p><p>
The number of students has increased very much of late; 
there are about an hundred and fifteen in college, and in the 
grammar school twenty-two commence this fall, all of them in 
American cloth. 
</p><p>
With my love to all the family, I am, honored sir, your 
affectionate son. 
</p>
