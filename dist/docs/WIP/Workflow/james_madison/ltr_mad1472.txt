DEAR SIR, I have nothing new this week for you but two 
reports ; the first is, that very great discontents prevail in New 
York among the German troops, for causes pretty similar to 
those which produced the eruption in the Pennsylvania line. It 
is further said on this head, that a body of two hundred have 
deserv.d from Long Island and gone to Rhode Island. The 
other report is, that the British minister either has or proposes 
to carry a bill into Parliament authorizing the commanding 
officer in America to permit and promote a trade with us in 
British goods of every kind, except linens and woollens. This 
change of system is said to be the advice of some notable 
refugees, with a view to revive an intercourse as far as possible 
between the two countries, and particularly to check the habit 
that is taking place in the consumption of French manufactures. 
Whatever their public views may be, it is certain that such a 
plan would open fine prospects to them in a private view. 
</p><p>
We have received no fresh or certain information of the 
</p><p>
designs of F. and Spain in assembling so great a force at Cadiz. There does not appear to be any object in that quarter 
except Gibraltar. Should the attempts be renewed against 
that place, it will prove that the former has not that absolute 
sway in the cabinet of the latter which has been generally 
imagined. Nothing would have prevailed on the French to 
recall their fleet from the islands at the time they did, but the 
necessity of humoring Spain on the subject of her hobby-horse. 
I am glad to hear that Arnold has been at last fired at. It 
sounded a little unfavorably for us in the ears of people here 
that he was likely to get off without that proof of a hostile 
reception. If he ventures an irruption in any other quarter, I 
hope he will be made sensible that his impunity on James river 
was owing to the suddenness of his appearance, and not to the 
want of spirit in the people. 
</p><p>
I am, Dr sir, yours sincerely.
