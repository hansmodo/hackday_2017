HONORED SIR, I received your letter by Mr. Kossekrans, 
and wrote an answer; but as it is probable this will arrive 
sooner which I now write by Dr. Witherspoon, I shall repeat 
some circumstances to avoid obscurity. 
</p><p>
On Wednesday last we had the usual commencement. Eighteen young gentlemen took their Bachelor's degrees, and a considerable number their Master's degrees. The degree of Doctor 
of Laws was bestowed on Mr. Dickinson the Farmer, and Mr. 
Galloway the Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly, a distinguishing mark of honor, as there never was any of that kind 
done before in America. The commencement began at ten 
o'clock, when the President walked first into the church, a 
board of trustees following, and behind them those that were to 
take their first degrees. After a short prayer by the President, 
the head oration, which is always given to the greatest scholar 
by the President and Tutors, was pronounced in Latin by Mr. 
Samuel Smith, son of a Presbyterian minister in Pennsylvania. 
Then followed the other orations, disputes, and dialogues, distributed to each according to his merit, and last of all was pronounced the valedictory oration by Mr. John Henry, son of a 
gentleman in Maryland. This is given to the greatest Orator. 
We had a very great assembly of people, a considerable number 
of whom came from <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>; those at <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> were 
most of them detained by Races which were to follow on the 
next day. 
</p><p>
Since commencement, the trustees have been sitting about 
business relative to the college, and have chosen for tutors for 
the ensuing year, for the junior class, Mr. Houston from North 
Carolina, in the room of Mr. Peream; for the freshman class, 
Mr. Reeve, (a gentleman who has for several years past kept a 
school at <a href="/results.php?city=elizabethtown" rel="city">Elizabethtown</a>,) in the room of Mr. Pemberton. The 
sophomore tutor, Mr. Thomson, still retains his place, remarkable for his skill in the sophomore studies, having taken care 
of that class for several years past. Mr. Halsey was chosen 
junior tutor, but refused. The trustees have likewise appointed 
Mr. Caldwell, a minister at <a href="/results.php?city=elizabethtown" rel="city">Elizabethtown</a>, to take a journey 
through the Southern Provinces as far as Georgia, to make collections by which the college fund may be enabled to increase 
the library, provide an apparatus of mathematical and philosophical instruments, and likewise to support professors, which 
would be a great addition to the advantages of this college. 
Dr. Witherspoon's business to Virginia is nearly the same, as I 
conjecture, and perhaps to form some acquaintance to induce 
gentlemen to send their sons to this college. 
</p><p>
I feel great satisfaction from the assistance my uncle has received from the springs, and I flatter myself from the continuance of my mother's health that Dr. Shore's skill will effectually 
banish the cause of her late indisposition. 
</p><p>
I recollect nothing more at present worth relating, but as 
often as opportunity and anything worthy your attention shall 
occur, be assured you shall hear from 
</p><p>
Your affectionate son.
