MY DEAREST, We reached the end of our journey yesterday at one o clock, with out interruption of any sort on the road. Mr. Coles had been here some time, and 
one, if not two, of the expected despatch vessels of England had just arrived, and Mr. Gilston, after a short passage from France, entered <a href="/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> about the moment I did. You may guess, therefore, the 
volumes of papers before us. I am but just dipping into them, and have seen no one as yet, except Mrs. Smith for a few minutes last evening. What number of days I may be detained here it is impossible to say. The period, you may be sure, 
will be shortened as much as possible. Everything around and within reminds me that you are absent, and makes me anxious to quit this solitude. I hope in my next to be able to say when I may have this gratification, perhaps also to say something 
of the intelligence just brought us. I send the paper of this morning, which has some thing on the subject, and I hope the communications of Gilston will be found more favorable than is stated. Those from England can scarcely be favorable when such 
men hold the reins. Mr. and Mrs. Erskine are here. His successor had not sailed on the 20th of June. 
</p><p>
God bless you, and be assured of my constant affection.
