</p><p>
DEAR SIR, The Assembly adjourned the day before yesterday. I have been obliged to remain here since on private business for my Countrymen with the Auditor's and other departments. I had allotted towards the close of the session to undertake a narration for you of the proceedings, but the hurry, 
on which I did not sufficiently calculate, rendered it impossible, 
and I now find myself so abridged in time that I cannot fulfil 
my intentions. It will, however, be the less material, as Mr. 
Short, by whom this goes, will be possessed of almost every 
thing I could say. I inclose you a list of the acts passed, excepting a few which had not received the last solemnity when 
the list went to the press. Among the latter is an Act under 
which 1 per cent, of the land tax will be collected this fall, and 
will be for Congress. This, with the 1 per cent, added to the 
impost on trade, will be all that Congress will obtain on their 
last requisition for this year. It will be much short of what 
they need, and of what might be expected from the declarations 
with which we introduced the business of the Session. These 
declarations will be seen in the Journal, a copy of which I take 
for granted will be carried by <a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Short</a>. Another act not on 
the list lays duties on law proceedings, on alienations of land, 
on probats of wills, administration, and some other transactions 
which pass through official hands. This tax may be considered 
as the basis of a stamp tax; it will probably yield fifteen or 
twenty thousand pounds at present, which is set apart for the 
foreign Creditors of this State. 
</p><p>
We made a warm struggle for the establishment of Norfolk 
and <a href="/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a> as our only ports; but were obliged to add 
York, Tappahannock, and Bermuda hundred, in order to gain 
any thing and to restrain to these ports foreigners only. The 
footing on which British debts are put will appear from the 
Journal, noting only that a law is now in force which forbids 
suits for them. The minority in the Senate have protested on 
the subject. Having not seen the protest, I must refer to Mr. 
Short, who will no doubt charge himself with it. 
</p><p>
A trial was made for a State Convention, but in a form not 
the most lucky. The adverse temper of the House, and particularly of <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>, had determined me to be silent on the 
subject. But a petition from Augusta, having among other 
things touched on a Reform of the Government, and <a href='/results.php?tla=rhl' rel='co-worker'>R. H. Lee</a> 
arriving with favorable sentiments, we thought it might not be 
amiss to stir the matter. Mr. Stuart, from Augusta, accordingly proposed to the Committee of propositions the Resolutions 
reported to the House, as per Journal. Unluckily, <a href='/results.php?tla=rhl' rel='co-worker'>R. H. Lee</a> 
was obliged by sickness to leave us the day before the question 
came on in committee of the whole, and <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> shewed a 
more violent opposition than we expected. The consequence 
was, that after two days' Debate the Report was negatived, and 
the majority, not content with stopping the measure for the present, availed themselves of their strength to put a supposed bar 
on the Journal against a future possibility of carrying it. The 
members for a Convention with full powers were not considerable for number, but included most of the young men of education and talents. A great many would have concurred in a 
Convention for specified amendments, but they were not disposed to be active even for such a qualified plan. 
</p><p>
Several petitions came forward in behalf of a General assessment, which was reported by the Committee of Religion to be 
reasonable. The friends of the measure did not chuse to try 
their strength in the House. The Episcopal Clergy introduced 
a notable project for re-establishing their independence of the 
laity. The foundation of it was, that the whole body should be 
legally incorporated, invested with the present property of the 
Church, made capable of acquiring indefinitely, empowered to 
make canons and bye-laws not contrary to the laws of the land, 
and incumbents, when once chosen by vestries, to be immoveable 
otherwise than by sentence of the convocation. Extraordinary 
as such a project was, it was preserv. from a dishonorable death 
by the talents of <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>. It lies over for another session. 
</p><p>
The public lands at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> not wanted for public use are 
ordered to be sold, and the money, aided by subscriptions, to be 
applied to the erection of buildings on the Hill, as formerly 
planned. This fixes the Government, which was near being 
made as vagrant as that of the United States, by a coalition 
between the friends of Williarnsburg and Staunton. The point 
was carried by a small majority only. 
</p><p>
The lands about <a href="/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a> are given to the University, 
and are worth, Mr. H. Tazewell thinks, 10,000 to it. For the 
encouragement of Mr. Maury's School, licence is granted for a 
lottery ito raise not more than 2,000. 
</p><p>
The revisal is ordered to be printed. A frivolous economy 
restrained the number of copies to 500. I shall secure the number you want and forward them by the first opportunity. The 
three reviserv. labour was recollected on this occasion, and 
500 voted for each. I have taken out your warrant in five 
parts, that it may be the more easily converted to use. It is to 
be paid out of the first unappropriated money in the Treasury, 
which renders its value very precarious unless the Treasurer 
should be willing to endorse it " receivable in taxes," which he 
is not obliged to do. I shall await your orders as to the disposition of it. 
An effort was made for Paine, and the prospect once flattering. But a sudden opposition was brewed up, which put a negative on every form which could be given to the proposed remuneration. <a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Short</a> will give you particulars. 
</p><p>
Col. Mason, the Attorney, Mr. Henderson, and myself, are to 
negotiate with Maryland, if she will appoint Commissioners to 
establish regulations for the Potowmac. 
</p><p>
Since the receipt of yours of May 8, I have made diligent enquiry concerning the several schools most likely to answer for 
the education of your nephews. My information has determined 
me finally to prefer that of Mr. W. Maury, as least exceptionable. I have accordingly recommended it to Mrs. Carr, and 
on receiving her answer shall write to Mr. Maury, pointing out 
your wishes as to the course of study proper for Master Carr. 
I have not yet made up any opinion as to the disposition of 
your younger nephew, but shall continue my enquiries till I can 
do so. I find a greater deficiency of proper schools than I 
could have supposed, low as my expectations were on the subject. All that I can assure you of is, that I shall pursue your 
wishes with equal pleasure and faithfulness. 
</p><p>
Your hint for appropriating the Slave tax to Congress fell in 
precisely with the opinion I had formed and suggested to those 
who are most attentive to our finances. The existing appropriation of half of it, however, to the military debt, was deemed 
a bar to such a measure. I wished for it because the slave 
holders are Tobacco makers, and will generally have hard 
money, which alone will serv.for Congress. Nothing can exceed the confusion which reigns throughout our revenue department. We attempted, but in vain, to ascertain the amount of 
our debts and of our resources, as a basis for something like a 
system. Perhaps by the next session the information may be 
prepared. This confusion, indeed, runs through all our public 
affairs, and must continue as long as the present mode of legislating continues. If we cannot amend the Constitution, we 
must at least call in the aid of accurate penmen for extending 
Resolutions into bills, which at present are drawn in a manner 
that must soon bring our laws and our Legislature into contempt among all orders of Citizens. 
</p><p>
I have communicated your request from <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, May 
25, to Mr. Zane. He writes by <a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Short</a>, and tells me he is 
possessed of the observ.ions which he promised you. I found 
no opportunity of broaching a scheme for opening the navigation of the Potowmac under the auspices of <a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met"><a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a></a>, or of providing for such occurrences as the case of Marbois. 
With the aid of the Attorney, perhaps something may be done 
on the latter point next Session. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear friend.
