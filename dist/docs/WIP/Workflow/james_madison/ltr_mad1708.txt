TO GEN'L H. LEE.

<a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">PHILADELPHIA</a>, April 15th, <a href="/results.php?year=1792">1792</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR, I have already acquainted you with the nominations of the President for General Officers. They have all 
been confirmed by the Senate except Wilkinson, who, I am told, 
will be to-morrow. The Commander-in-Chief, it is said, went 
through the Senate rather against the bristles. The appointment is well relished of course by some, but does not escape, already, considerable criticism. I am glad to find by your letter 
of the 4th, which did not come to hand till yesterday, that your 
inclinations and your anticipations so well coincide as they related to yourself; with respect to mine, the latter are as little 
disappointed by the event as yours, though that is not the case 
as to the former. The disappointment, however, would be more 
regretted if your present station were less important, and particularly to our own Country, at the present moment. 
</p><p>
Your remarks on the augmented duties are solid and weighty, 
but they will not prevail against the aversion to other taxes, 
and the collateral views to be answered by duties on imported 
manufactures. The worst is, that many of the new duties are 
made permanent, for which an advantage is taken of the pretexts blended with the original cause. 
</p><p>
You will see by the paper republished from <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> that 
the scene there is become more and more gloomy. There are 
reports which make it much worse. Speculating and Banking 
are as much execrated in that City as they were idolized a few 
weeks ago. The language will probably soon become general. 
Several failures have taken place here, notwithstanding the incessant and elaborate efforts to parry such a catastrophe as 
<a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> exhibits. It is thought, however, that an earthquake, 
though much slighter, will be inevitable within the present 
month. The train of circumstances which has led to these evils 
is obvious; and reflections must soon force themselves on the 
public mind, from which it has hitherto been diverted by a fallacious prosperity, and uncontradicted declamation in the Gazette. 
</p><p>
You know already that the President has exerted his power 
of checking the unconstitutional career of Congress. The judges 
have also called the attention of the public to Legislative fallibility, by pronouncing a law providing for Invalid Pensioners 
unconstitutional and void; perhaps they may be wrong in the 
execution of their power, but such an evidence of its existence 
gives inquietude to those who do not wish Congress to be controuled or doubted whilst its proceedings correspond with their 
views. I suspect, also, that the inquietude is increased by the 
relation of such a power to the Bank Law, in the public contemplation, if not in their own. 
</p><p>
Nothing done since my last on the further assumption, or the 
Report on the public debt. 
</p><p>
Substance of a Conversation with the President, 5 May, <a href="/results.php?year=1792">1792</a>. 
</p><p>
In consequence of a note this morning from the President, 
requesting me to call on him, I did so; when he opened the 
conversation by observ.g, that having some time ago communicated to me his intention of retiring from public life on the 
expiration of his four years, he wished to advise with me on the 
mode and time most proper for making known that intention. 
He had, he said, spoken with no one yet on those particular 
points, and took this opportunity of mentioning them to me, 
that I might consider the matter, and give him my opinion 
before the adjournment of Congress, or my departure from 
<a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. He had, he said, forborne to communicate his 
intentions to any other persons whatever but <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, 
Col. Hamilton, <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='co-worker'>General Knox</a>, and myself, and of late to Mr. 
Randolph. Col. Hamilton and GEN'L Knox, he observ., were 
extremely importunate that he should relinquish his purpose, 
and had made pressing representations to induce him to it. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a> had expressed his wishes to the like effect. He 
had not, however, persuaded himself that his continuance in 
public life could be of so much necessity or importance as was 
conceived, and his disinclination to it was becoming every day 
more and more fixed; so that he wished to make up his mind as 
soon as possible on the points he had mentioned. What he 
desired was, to prefer that mode which would be most remote 
from the appearance of arrogantly presuming on his re-election 
in case he should not withdraw himself, and such a time as 
would be most convenient to the public in making the choice 
of his successor. It had, he said, at first occurred to him, that 
the commencement of the ensuing session of Congress would 
furnish him with an apt occasion for introducing the intimation; 
but besides the lateness of the day, he was apprehensive that it 
might possibly produce some notice in the reply of Congress 
that might entangle him in farther explanations. 
</p><p>
I replied, that I would revolve the subject as he desired, and 
communicate the result before my leaving <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, but 
that I could not but yet hope there would be no necessity at 
this time for his decision on the two points he had stated. I 
told him that when he did me the honor to mention the resolution he had taken, I had forborne to do more than briefly 
express my apprehensions that it would give a surprise and 
shock to the public mind, being restrained from enlarging on 
the subject by an unwillingness to express sentiments sufficiently 
known to him, or to urge objections to a determination which, 
if absolute, it might look like affectation to oppose; that the 
aspect which things had been latterly assuming seemed, however, to impose the task on all who had the opportunity of 
urging a continuance of his public serv.es; and that, under 
such an impression, I held it a duty, not indeed to express my 
wishes, which would be superfluous, but to offer my opinion 
that his retiring at the present juncture might have effects that 
ought not to be hazarded; that I was not unaware of the 
urgency of his inclination, or of the peculiar motives he might 
feel to withdraw himself from a situation into which it was so 
well known to myself he had entered with a scrupulous reluctance; that I well recollected the embarrassments under which 
his mind labored in deciding the question on which he had consulted me, whether it could be his duty to accept his present 
station after having taken a final leave of public life; and that 
it was particularly in my recollection that I then entertained 
and intimated a wish that his acceptance, which appeared to be 
indispensable, might be known hereafter to have been in no 
degree the effect of any motive, which strangers to his character might suppose, but of the severe sacrifice which his friends 
knew he made of his inclinations as a man to his obligations as 
a citizen; that I owned I had at that time contemplated, and, I 
believed, suggested, as the most unequivocal though not the 
only proof of his real motive, a voluntary return to private 
life as soon as the state of the government would permit; trusting that if any premature casualty should unhappily cut off the 
possibility of this proof, the evidence known to his friends 
would in some way or other be saved from oblivion, and do 
justice to his character; that I was not less anxious on the 
same point now than I was then; and if I did not conceive that 
reasons of a like kind to those which required him to undertake still required him to retain, for some time longer, his 
present station, or did not presume that the purity of his 
motives would be sufficiently vindicated, I should be the last 
of his friends to press, or even to wish, such a determination. 
He then entered on a more explicit disclosure of the state of 
his mind; observ.g that he could not believe or conceive himself any wise necessary to the successful administration of the 
Government; that, on the contrary, he had from the beginning 
found himself deficient in many of the essential qualifications, 
owing to his inexperience in the forms of public business, his 
unfitness to judge of legal questions, and questions arising out 
of the Constitution; that others more conversant in such matters would be better able to execute the trust; that he found 
himself, also, in the decline of life, his health becoming sensibly 
more infirm, and perhaps his faculties also; that the fatigues 
and disagreeableness of his situation were in fact scarcely tolerable to him; that he only uttered his real sentiments when he 
declared that his inclination would lead him rather to go to his 
farm, take his spade in his hand, and work for his bread, than 
remain in his present situation; that it was evident, moreover, 
that a spirit of party in the Government was becoming a fresh 
source of difficulty, and he was afraid was dividing some (alluding to the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury) 
more particularly connected with him in the administration; 
that there were discontents among the people which were also 
shewing themselves more and more, and that although the various attacks against public men and measures had not in general been pointed at him, yet, in some instances, it had been visible that he was the indirect object, and it was probable the 
evidence would grow stronger and stronger that his return to 
private life was consistent with every public consideration, and, 
consequently, that he was justified in giving way to his inclination for it. 
</p><p>
I was led by this explanation to remark to him, that however 
novel or difficult the business might have been to him, it could 
not be doubted that, with the aid of the official opinions and informations within his command, his judgment must have been 
as competent in all cases as that of any one who could have 
been put in his place, and, in many cases, certainly more so; that 
in the great point of conciliating and uniting all parties under 
a Government which had excited such violent controversies and 
divisions, it was well known that his serv.es had been in a 
manner essential; that with respect to the spirit of party that 
was taking place under the operations of the Government, I was 
sensible of its existence, but considered that as an argument for 
his remaining, rather than retiring, until the public opinion, the 
character of the Government, and the course of its administration, should be better decided, which could not fail to happen in 
a short time, especially under his auspices; that the existing 
parties did not appear to be so formidable to the Government 
as some had represented; that in one party there might be a few 
who, retaining their original disaffection to the Government, 
might still wish to destroy it, but that they would lose their 
weight with their associates by betraying any such hostile purposes; that although it was pretty certain that the other were, 
in general, unfriendly to republican Government, and probably 
aimed at a gradual approximation of ours to a mixed monarchy, 
yet the public sentiment was so strongly opposed to their 
views, and so rapidly manifesting itself, that the party could 
not long be expected to retain a dangerous influence; that it 
might reasonably be hoped, therefore, that the conciliating influence of a temperate and wise administration would, before 
another term of four years should run out, give such a tone and 
firmness to the Government as would secure it against danger 
from either of these descriptions of enemies; that although I 
would not allow myself to believe but that the Government 
would be safely administered by any successor elected by the 
people, yet it was not to be denied, that in the present unsettled 
condition of our yflung Government, it was to be feared that no 
successor would answer all the purposes to be expected from 
the continuance of the present chief magistrate; that the option 
evidently lay between a few characters; <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a>, 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, were most likely to be brought into view; 
that with respect to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, his extreme repugnance to 
public life, and anxiety to exchange it for his farm and his philosophy, made it doubtful with his friends whether it would be 
possible to obtain his own consent; and if obtained, whether 
local prejudices in the Northern States, with the views of Pennsylvania in relation to the seat of 'Government, would not be a 
bar to his appointment. With respect to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>, his monarchical principles, which he had not concealed, with his late 
conduct on the representation bill, had produced such a settled 
dislike among republicans every where, and particularly in the 
Southern States, that he seemed to be out of the question. It 
would not be in the power of those who might be friendly to 
his private character and willing to trust him in a public one, 
notwithstanding his political principles, to make head against 
the torrent. With respect to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a>, his election would be 
extremely dissatisfactory on several accounts. By many he was 
believed to entertain the same obnoxious principles with Mr. 
Adams, and at the same time would be less open, and therefore 
more successful in propagating them. By others, (a pretty numerous class,) he was disliked and distrusted, as being thought 
to have espoused the claims of British creditors at the expense of 
the reasonable pretensions of his fellow-citizens in debt to them. 
Among the Western people, to whom his negotiations for ceding 
the Mississippi to Spain were generally known, he was considered as their most dangerous enemy, and held in peculiar distrust and disesteem. In this state of our prospects, which was 
rendered more striking by a variety of temporary circumstances, 
I could not forbear thinking that although his retirement might 
not be fatal to the public good, yet a postponement of it was 
another sacrifice exacted by his patriotism. 
</p><p>
Without appearing to be any wise satisfied with what I had 
urged, he turned the conversation to other subjects; and when I 
was withdrawing repeated his request that I would think of the 
points he had mentioned to me, and let him have my ideas on 
them before the adjournment. I told him I would do so, but 
still hoped his decision on the main question would supersede 
for the present all such incidental questions. 
</p><p>
WEDNESDAY EVENING, May 9, <a href="/results.php?year=1792">1792</a>. 
</p><p>
Understanding that the President was to set out the ensuing 
morning for Mount Vernon, I called on him to let him know 
that, as far as I had formed an opinion on the subject he had 
mentioned to me, it was in favor of a direct address of notification to the public, in time for its proper effect on the election, 
which I thought might be put into such a form as would avoid 
every appearance of presumption or indelicacy, and seemed to 
be absolutely required by his situation. I observ. that no 
other mode deserv.g consideration had occurred, except the 
one he had thought of and rejected, which seemed to me liable 
to the objections that had weighed with him. I added, that if 
on farther reflection I should view the subject in any new lights, 
I would make it the subject of a letter, though I retained my 
hopes that it would not yet be necessary for him to come to 
any opinion on it. He begged that I would do so, and also 
suggest any matters that might occur as proper to be included 
in what he might say to Congress at the opening of their next 
session; passing over the idea of his relinquishing his purpose 
of retiring in a manner that did not indicate the slightest assent to it. 
</p><p>
FRIDAY, May 25, <a href="/results.php?year=1792">1792</a>. 
</p><p>
I met the President on the road returning from Mount Vernon to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, when he handed me the letter dated at the 
latter place on the 20th of May, the copy of the answer to which 
on the 21st of June is annexed.
