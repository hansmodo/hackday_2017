DEAR SIR, The sanction given by your favor of the 12th to 
my desire of remunerating the genius which produced " Common 
Sense," has led to a trial in the Legislature for the purpose. 
The gift first proposed was a moiety of the tract on the Eastern 
Shore known by the name of the Secretary's land. The easy 
reception it found induced the friends of the measure to add the 
other moity to the proposition, which would have raised the 
market value of the donation to about 4,000, or upwards; 
though it would not probably have commanded a rent of more 
than X100 per annum. In this form the Bill passed through 
two readings. The third reading proved that the tide had 
suddenly changed, for the Bill was thrown out by a large 
majority. An attempt was next made to sell the land in question, and apply 2,000 of the money to the purchase of a Farm 
for <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a>. This was lost by a single vote. "Whether a 
greater disposition to reward patriotic and distinguished exertions of genius will be found on any succeeding occasion is not 
for me to predetermine. Should it finally appear that the 
merits of the Man, whose writings have so much contributed to 
infuse and foster the spirit of Independence in the people of 
America, are unable to inspire them with a just beneficence, the 
world, it is to be feared, will give us as little credit for our 
policy as for our gratitude in this particular. The wish of <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a> to be provided for by separate acts of the States, rather 
than by Congress, is, I think, a natural and just one. In the 
latter case it might be construed into the wages of a mercenary 
writer. In the former, it would look like the returns of gratitude for voluntary serv.es. Upon the same principle, the mode 
wished by <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a> ought to be preferred by the States themselves.
