DEAR SIR, Along with this are enclosed a few copies of the 
latest gazettes, containing the additional papers in favor of the 
federal Constitution. 
</p><p>
I find by from <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> that the proceedings of the 
Assembly are, as usual, rapidly degenerating with the progress 
of the Session; and particularly that the force opposed to the 
act of the Convention has gained the ascendance. There is 
still, nevertheless, a hope left that different characters and a 
different spirit may prevail in their successors, who are to make 
the final decision. In one point of view, the present Assembly 
may, perhaps, be regarded as pleading most powerfully the cause 
of the new government, for it is impossible for stronger proofs 
to be found than in their conduct of the necessity of some such 
anchor against the fluctuations which threaten to shipwreck our 
liberty. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, with the most sincere and perfect esteem, your 
affect 8 and obt humble serv.t.
