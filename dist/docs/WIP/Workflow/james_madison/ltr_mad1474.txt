DEAR SIR, A letter which I received a few days ago from 
<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> gives me a hope that he will lend his succor in 
defending the title of Virginia. He professes ignorance of the 
ground on which the report of the committee places the controversy. I have exhorted him not to drop his purpose, and 
referred him to you as a source of copious information on the 
subject. I wish much you and he could unite your ideas on it. 
Since you left us I have picked up several pamphlets which had 
escaped our researches. Among them are the examination of 
the Connecticut claim, and the charter of Georgia, bound up 
with that of Maryland and four others. Presuming that a 
better use will be made of them, I will send them by Mr. Jones, 
requesting, however, that they may be returned by the hands of 
him, Doctor Lee, or yourself, as the case may be.
