DEAR SIR, The information conveyed in your favor of the 
17 ult lays me under great obligations. It was by no means 
my wish to have imposed the task of so full and particular a 
view of the subject. The general result in your own mind was 
all that I had in contemplation. 
</p><p>
One of the papers herewith enclosed will shew you the state 
of the election for the Senate in Massachusetts. It was understood here that <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='colleague'>Mr. Bowdoin</a> was appointed, and I have transmitted the error to some of my correspondents. New Hampshire has made choice of President Langdon and Judge Bartlett. New Jersey, of Mr. Patterson and Doct r Elmer. Delaware, of Mr. Reed and Mr. Bassett. South Carolina has postponed her choice till January. Mr. Izard, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague'>Mr. J. Rutledge</a>, 
Mr. Butler, and Mr. C. Pinckney, are the subjects of conversation. Pennsylvania alone has arrived at 'the election for the 
other branch. The entire result is not yet known; but a sufficient number of the Counties have been heard from to warrant 
a confidence that 7 out of the 8, and a probability that the whole 
eight, will be found in the federal ticket. This prospect is, on 
the whole, auspicious; and shews the folly of Virginia, if the 
measures of the Legislature are to be taken for the sense of the 
State, in urging another Convention at this time. The real 
friends to the object professed by the leaders at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> 
ought to see that the only hope of obtaining alterations lies 
in not aiming at too many, and in being conciliatory as to the 
mode. 
</p><p>
I came to this city with a view either to return to <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> 
or proceed to Virginia, as circumstances might require. I was 
not sure that the spirit of party might not take pleasure in superseding the opportunity of remaining longer in <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. 
That, I find, has not been the case; and a task which I had assigned myself for the winter, or rather a part of it, would be 
favored by a situation in which I could have access to the 
papers of Congress. On this account, a return to <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> 
for the ensuing fraction of a year would not be inconvenient. 
But I am pressed much in several quarters to try the effect of 
presence on the district into which I fall for electing a Representative, and am apprehensive that an omission of that expedient may eventually expose me to blame. At the same time, 
I have an extreme distaste to steps having an electioneering 
appearance, altho' they should lead to an appointment in which 
I am disposed to serv.the public; and am very dubious, moreover, whether any step which might seem to denote a solicitude 
on my part would not be as likely to operate against as in favor 
of my pretensions. In this situation I am not clearly and finally 
decided as to the part which ought to be taken. When I see 
the Counties with which <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> is associated, I shall, perhaps, 
be more able to form some estimates which should influence my 
determination. This information I hourly expect, and in case 
it should induce me to continue my course to Virginia, I shall 
leave this immediately, or at least as soon as I can bear the 
journey. I have for some time past been much indisposed with 
the piles. They have not yet entirely gone off, and may possibly detain me some days longer than the season would otherwise admit. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of esteem and affection, I am, D'r Sir, 
your mo. obed. hble serv.t.
