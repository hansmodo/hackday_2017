</p><p>
DEAR SIR, I have received your two favors of the 11th ult. by Mr. D. R., and of the 18th by post. 
</p><p>
The conduct of Genet, as developed in these, and in his proceedings as exhibited in the newspapers, is as unaccountable as 
it is distressing. The effect is beginning to be strongly felt 
here, in the surprise and disgust of those who are attached to 
the French cause, and viewed this Minister as the instrument 
for cementing, instead of alienating, the two Republics. These 
sensations are powerfully reinforced by the general and habitual veneration for the President. The Anglican party is busy, 
as you may suppose, in making the worst of everything, and in 
turning the public feelings against France, and thence in favor 
of England. The only antidote for their poison is to distinguish between the nation and its agent; between principles and 
events; and to impress the well-meaning with the fact that the 
enemies of France and of Liberty are at work to lead them 
from their honorable connection with these into the arms, and 
ultimately into the Government, of Great Britain. If the 
genuine sense of the people could be collected on the several 
points comprehended in the occasion, the calamity would be 
greatly alleviated, if not absolutely controuled. But this is 
scarcely possible. The country is too much uninformed, and 
too inert to speak for itself; and the language of the Towns, 
which are generally directed by an adverse interest, will insidiously inflame the evil. It is, however, of such infinite importance to our own Government, as well as to that of France, that 
the real sentiments of the people here should be understood, 
that something ought to be attempted on that head. I inclose 
a copy of a train of Ideas sketched on the first rumour of the 
war between the Executive and Genet, and particularly suggested by the <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> Resolutions, as a groundwork for 
those who might take the lead in County meetings. It was intended that they should be modified in every particular, according to the state of information and the particular temper 
of the place. A copy has been sent to Caroline, with a hope 
that <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Pendleton</a> might find it not improper to step forward; 
another is gone to the District Court at Staunton in the hands 
of Monroe, who carried a letter from me on the subject to A. 
Stuart; and a third will be for consideration at the district 
court at Charlottesville. If these examples should be set, 
there may be a chance of like proceedings elsewhere; and in 
themselves they will be respectable specimens of the principles 
and sensations of the agricultural, which is the commanding 
part of the Society. I am not sanguine, however, that the 
effort will succeed. If it does not, the State Legislatures, and 
the federal also, if possible, must be induced to take up the 
matter in its true point of view. Monroe and myself read with 
attention your despatch by D. R., and had much conversation 
on what passed between you and the President. It appeared 
to both of us that a real anxiety was marked to retain you in 
office; that over and above other motives, it was felt that your 
presence and implied sanction might be a necessary shield 
against certain criticisms from certain quarters; that the departure of the only counsellor possessing the confidence of the 
Republicans would be a signal for new and perhaps very disagreeable attacks; that in this point of view the respectful and 
conciliatory language of the President is worthy of particular 
attention, and that it affords a better hope than has existed of 
your being able to command attention, and to moderate the 
predominant tone. We agreed in opinion, also, that whilst this 
end is pursued, it would be wise to make as few concessions as 
possible that might embarrass the free pursuit of measures 
which may be dictated by Eepublican principles, and required 
by the public good. In a word, we think you ought to make 
the most of the value we perceive to be placed on your participation in the Executive counsels. I am extremely glad to find 
that you are to remain another quarter. The season will be 
more apropos in several respects; and it will prevent any cooperation which a successor might be disposed to make towards 
a final breach with France. I have little hope that you will 
have one whose policy will have the same healing tendency 
with yours. I foresee, I think, that it will be either King, if 
Johnson is put at the Treasury, or E. Rutledge. if Wolcott 
should be put there. I am glad the President rightly infers my 
determination from antecedent circumstances, so as to free me 
from imputations in his mind connected with the present state 
of things. Monroe is particularly solicitous that you should 
take the view of your present position and opportunities above 
suggested. He sees so forcibly the difficulty of keeping the 
feelings of the people as to Genet distinct from those due to 
his constituents, that he can hardly prevail on himself, absolutely and openly, to abandon him. I concur with him that it 
ought to be done no farther than is forced upon us; that general 
silence is better than open denunciation and crimination; and 
that it is not unfair to admit the apologetic influence of the 
errors in our own government, which may have inflamed the 
passions which now discolor every object to his eye such as 
the refusal, in the outset of the government, to favor the commerce of France more than that of Great Britain; the unfortunate appointment of Gouv. Morris to the former; the language 
of the proclamation; the attempts of Pacificus to explain away 
and dissolve the Treaty; the notoriety of the author, and the 
appearance of its being an informal manifestation of the views 
of the Executive, &c. 
</p><p>
I paid a short visit to Mr. W. C. Nicholas, as I proposed. 
He talks like a sound Republican and sincere friend to the 
French cause, in every respect. I collected from him that 
Edmund Randolph had admitted to him that he drew the proclamation; that he had been attacked on it at Chatham by 
Mr. Jos. Jones; that he reprobated the comment of Pacificus, &c. 
W. C. N. observ. that Hamilton had taken the Executive in 
by gaining phrases, of which he could make the use he has done. 
</p><p>
I hope you have received the five N os . of Helvidius. I must 
resume the task, I suppose, in relation to the Treaty and gratitude. I feel, however, so much awkwardness under the new 
posture of things, that I shall deliberate whether a considerable 
postponement, at least, may not be advisable. 
</p><p>
I found, also, on my return, a house full of particular friends, 
who will stay some weeks, and receive and return visits, from 
which I cannot decently exclude myself. If I should perceive 
it impossible or improper to continue the publication, so as to 
avail myself of the channel used to the press, I shall suspend it 
till I see and talk with you on the whole matter. 
</p><p>
Adieu.

It being considered that it is at all times the right, and at certain periods the duty, of the people to declare their principles 
and opinions on subjects which concern the national interest; 
that at the present conjuncture this duty is rendered the more indispensable by the prevailing practice of declaratory resolutions, 
in places where the inhabitants can more easily assemble and 
consult than in the country at large, and where interests, views, 
and political opinions, different from those of the great body of 
the people, may happen to predominate, whence there may be 
danger of unfair and delusive inferences concerning the true 
and general sense of the people; it being also considered that, 
under the disadvantage a great proportion of the people [suffer?] 
in their distant and dispersed situation, from the want of timely 
and correct knowledge of particular incidents, and the conduct 
of particular persons connected with public transactions, it is 
most prudent and safe to wait with a decent reserv.for full 
and satisfactory information in relation thereto, and in public 
declarations to abide by those great principles,- just sentiments, 
and established truths, which can be little affected by personal 
or transitory occurrences: 
</p><p>
Therefore, as the sense of the present Meeting, 
</p><p>
Resolved, That the Constitution of the United States ought 
to be firmly and vigilantly supported against all direct or indirect attempts that may be made to subvert or violate the 
same: 
</p><p>
That as it is the interest of the United States to cultivate the 
preserv.ion of peace by all just and honorable means, the Executive authority ought to be supported in the exercise of its 
Constitutional powers and functions for enforcing the laws existing for that purpose: 
</p><p>
That the eminent virtues and serv.es of our illustrious fellow-citizen, <a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met">George Washington</a>, President of the United States, 
entitle him to the highest respect and lasting gratitude of his 
Country, whose peace, liberty, and safety, must ever remind it 
of his distinguished agency in promoting the same: 
</p><p>
That the eminent and generous aids rendered to the United 
States in their arduous struggle for liberty by the French 
Nation ought ever to be remembered and acknowledged with 
gratitude, and that the spectacle exhibited by the severe and 
glorious contest in which it is now engaged for its own liberty, 
ought and must be peculiarly interesting to the wishes, the 
friendship, and the sympathy of the people of America: 
</p><p>
That all attempts which may be made, in whatever form or 
disguise, to alienate the good will of the people of America 
from the cause of liberty and republican Government in France, 
have a tendency to weaken their affection to the free principles 
of their own Government, and manifest designs which ought to 
be narrowly watched and seasonably counteracted: 
</p><p>
That such attempts to disunite Nations mutually attached to 
the cause of liberty, and viewed with unfriendly eyes by all who 
hate it, ought more particularly to be reprobated at the present 
crisis, when such vast efforts are making by a combination of 
Princes and Nobles to crush an example that may open the eyes 
of all mankind to their natural and political rights: 
</p><p>
That a dissolution of the honorable and beneficial connection 
between the United States and France would obviously tend to 
forward a plan of connecting them with Great Britain, as one 
great, leading step towards assimilating our Government to the 
form and spirit of the British Monarchy; and that this apprehension is greatly strengthened by the active zeal displayed by 
persons disaffected to the American Revolution, and by others 
of known monarchical principles, in propagating prejudices 
against the French Nation and Revolution.
