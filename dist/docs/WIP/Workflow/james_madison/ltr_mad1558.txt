DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 16th instant came to hand too 
late on thursday evening to be answered by the last mail. I 
have considered well the circumstances which it confidentially 
discloses, as well as those contained in your preceding favor. 
The difficulties which they oppose to an acceptance of the appointment, in which you are included, can as little be denied as 
they can fail to be regretted. But I still am inclined to think 
that the posture of our affairs, if it should continue, would prevent every criticism on the situation which the cotemporary 
meetings would place you in; and that at least a door could be 
kept open for your acceptance hereafter, in case the gathering 
clouds become so dark and menacing as to supersede every consideration but that of our national existence and safety. A 
suspension of your ultimate determination would be nowise inconvenient in a public view, as the Executive are authorised to 
fill vacancies, and can fill them at any time; and, in any event, 
three out of seven deputies are authorized to represent the 
State. How far it may be admissible in another view will depend, perhaps, in some measure, on the chance of your finally 
undertaking the serv.e, but principally on the correspondence 
which is now passing on the subject between yourself and the 
Governor. 
</p><p>
Your observ.ions on Tobacco as a commutable in the taxes 
are certainly just and unanswerable. My acquiescence in the 
measure was against every general principle which I have embraced, and was extorted by a fear that some greater evil under 
the name of relief to the people would be substituted. I am far 
from being sure, however, that I did right. The other evils 
contended for have, indeed, been as yet parried, but it is very 
questionable whether the concession in the affair of the Tobacco 
had much hand in it. The original object was paper money. 
Petitions for graduating certificates succeeded. Next came instalments. And, lastly, a project for making property a tender 
for debts at four-fifths of its value. All these have been happily 
got rid of by very large majorities. But the positive efforts in 
favor of Justice have been less successful. A plan for reforming the administration in this branch, accommodated more to 
the general opinion than the Assize plan, got as far as the third 
reading, and was then lost by a single vote. The Senate would 
have passed it readily, and would have even added amendments 
of the right complexion. I fear it will be some time before 
this necessary reform will again have a fair chance. Besides 
some other grounds of apprehension, it may well be supposed 
that the Bill, which is to be printed for consideration of the 
public, will, instead of calling forth the sanction of the wise 
and virtuous, be a signal to interested men to redouble their 
efforts to get into the Legislature. 
</p><p>
The Revenue business is still unfinished. The present rage 
seems to be to draw all our income from trade. From the sample given of the temper of the House of Delegates on this subject, it is much to be feared that the duties will be augmented 
with so daring a hand, that we shall drive away our trade instead of making it tributary to our Treasury. The only hope 
that can be indulged is that of moderating the fury. The port 
bill was defended against a repeal by about 70 votes against 
about 40. The revised code is not quite finished, and must receive the last hand from a succeeding Assembly. Several bills 
of consequence being rendered unfit to be passed in their present form, by a change of circumstances since they were prepared, necessarily require revision. Others, as the Education 
bill, &c., are thought to be adapted only to a further degree of 
wealth and population. Others, as the Execution bill, which 
subjects lands to debts, do not find yet an adequate patronage. 
Several bills, also, and particularly the bill relating to crimes 
and punishments, have been rejected, and require reconsideration from another Assembly. This last bill, after being purged 
of its objectionable peculiarities, was thrown out on the third 
reading by a single vote. 
</p><p>
It will little elevate your idea of our Senate to be told that 
they negatived the bill defining the privileges of Ambassadors, 
on the principle, as I am told, that an alien ought not to be put 
on better ground than a citizen. British debts have not yet 
been mentioned, and probably will not, unless Congress say 
something on the matter before the adjournment.
