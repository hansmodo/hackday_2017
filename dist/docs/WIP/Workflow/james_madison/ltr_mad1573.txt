HON'D SlR, We have been here for some time, suffering a 
daily disappointment from the failure of the deputies to assemble for the Convention. Seven States were not made up till 
the day before yesterday. Our intelligence from <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> 
promises an addition of three more by to-morrow. <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> was unanimously called to the chair, and has accepted it. It is impossible, as yet, to form a judgment of the 
result of this experiment. Every reflecting man becomes daily 
more alarmed at our situation. The unwise and wicked proceedings of the Governments of some States, and the unruly 
temper of the people of others, must, if persevered in, soon produce some new scenes among us.

My enquiries concerning the iron do not promise any supply 
from the quarter you wished it, nor do I find the advantage 
which formerly existed in sending the other articles. The late 
regulations of Trade here and in Virginia, particularly the act 
of the latter requiring the cargoes destined to Frederiksburg, 
&c., to be deposited, in the first instance, at ports below, are obstructions to the intercourse. Tobacco, however, of the first 
quality, may be sent hither to advantage. Old Tobacco of this 
description will command six dollars. Mine, which has arrived 
safe, being new, will not, I fear, fetch me more than 32-s., Virginia currency.

Mr. William Strother, who was lately here, gave me the first 
information of the event of the election. I was not more concerned than surprised at the rejection of Major Moore. I am 
unable, utterly, to account for so sudden and great a change in 
the disposition of the people towards him. False reports occur 
as the most probable cause. 
</p><p>
I have enjoyed good health since I left Virginia, and learnt 
with much pleasure, from Mr. Strother, that he had heard nothing otherwise with respect to my friends in general in <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>. 
</p><p>
Remember me affectionately to my mother and the rest of the 
family, and accept of the dutiful regards of, 
</p><p>
Your son.
