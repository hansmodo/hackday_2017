TO JAMES MADISON, ESQ. [SR]
</p><p>
Jan. 1st, <a href="/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>. 
HON'D SlR, 
</p><p>
The negotiations for peace are said to be going on under the 
late commission to Mr. Oswald, which authorizes him to treat 
with commissioners from the thirteen United States. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a> will depart in a little time, in order to give his aid in case 
it be in season. The insidiousness and instability of the British 
Cabinet forbid us to be sanguine, especially as the relief of 
Gibraltar was posterior to Oswald's commission, and the interests to be adjusted among the belligerent parties are extremely complicated. 
</p><p>
I am, with great affection, your dutiful son. 
</p>
