TO MR. WILLIAM BRADFORD, Jun. 
</p><p>
January the 24th, <a href="/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
MY WORTHY FRIEND, Yours of the 25th of last month came 
into my hands a few days past. It gave singular pleasure, not 
only because of the kindness expressed in it, but because I had 
reason to apprehend the letter you received last from me had 
miscarried, and I should fail in procuring the intelligence I 
wanted before the trip I designed in the spring. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on your heroic proceedings in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> with regard to the tea. I wish <a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> may conduct 
matters with as much discretion as they seem to do with boldness. They seem to have great trials and difficulties by reason 
of the obduracy and ministerialism of their G-overnor. However, political contests are necessary sometimes, as well as 
military, to afford exercise and practice, and to instruct in the 
art of defending liberty and property. I verily believe the 
frequent assaults that have been made on America (<a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> 
especially) will in the end prove of real advantage. 
</p><p>
If the Church of England had been the established and 
general religion in all the northern colonies as it has been 
among us here, and uninterrupted tranquillity had prevailed 
throughout the continent, it is clear to me that slavery and 
subjection might and would have been gradually insinuated 
among us. Union of religious sentiments begets a surprising 
confidence, and ecclesiastical establishments tend to great ignorance and corruption; all of which facilitate the execution of 
mischievous projects. 
</p><p>
But away with politics ! Let me address you as a student 
and philosopher, and not as a patriot, now. I am pleased that 
you are going to converse with the Edwards and Henrys and 
Charleses, &c., &c., who have swayed the British sceptre, though 
I believe you will find some of them dirty and unprofitable 
companions, unless you will glean instruction from their follies, 
and fall more in love with liberty by beholding such detestable 
pictures of tyranny and cruelty. 
</p><p>
I was afraid you would not easily have loosened your affections from the belles lettres. A delicate taste and warm imagination like yours must find it hard to give up such refined and 
exquisite enjoyments for the coarse and dry study of the law. 
It is like leaving a pleasant flourishing field for a barren deserv. 
perhaps I should not say barren either, because the law does 
bear fruit, but it is sour fruit, that must be gathered and 
pressed and distilled before it can bring pleasure or profit. I 
perceive I have made a very awkward comparison; but I got 
the thought by the end, and had gone too far to quit it before I 
perceived that it was too much entangled in my brain to run it 
through; and so you must forgive it. I myself used to have 
too great a hankering after those amusing studies. Poetry, 
wit, and criticism, romances, plays, &c., captivated me much; 
but I began to discover that they deserv.but a small portion 
of a mortal's time, and that something more substantial, more 
durable, and more profitable, befits a riper age. It would be 
exceedingly improper for a laboring man to have nothing but 
flowers in his garden, or to determine to eat nothing but sweetmeats and confections. Equally absurd would it be for a 
scholar and a man of business to make up his whole library 
with books of fancy, and feed his mind with nothing but such 
luscious performances. 
</p><p>
When you have an opportunity and write to Mr. Brackenridge, pray tell him I often think of him, and long to see him, 
and am resolved to do so in the spring. George Luckey was 
with me at Christmas, and we talked so much about old affairs 
and old friends, that I have a most insatiable desire to see you 
all. Luckey will accompany me, and we are to set off on the 
10th of April, if no disaster befalls either of us. 
</p><p>
I want again to breathe your free air. I expect it will mend 
my constitution and confirm my principles. I have indeed as 
good an atmosphere at home as the climate will allow; but have 
nothing to brag of as to the state and liberty of my country. 
Poverty and luxury prevail among all sorts; pride, ignorance, 
and knavery among the priesthood, and vice and wickedness 
among the laity. This is bad enough, but it is not the worst I 
have to tell you. That diabolical, hell-conceived principle of 
persecution rages among some; and to their eternal infamy, the 
clergy can furnish their quota of imps for such business. This 
vexes me the worst of anything whatever. There are at this 
time in the adjacent country not less than five or six wellmeaning men in close jail for publishing their religious sentiments, which in the main are very orthodox. I have neither 
patience to hear, talk, or think of anything relative to this 
matter; for I have squabbled and scolded, abused and ridiculed, 
so long about it to little purpose, that I am without common 
patience. So I must beg you to pity me, and pray for liberty 
of conscience to all. 
</p><p>
I expect to hear from you once more before I see you, if time 
will admit; and want to know when the synod meets, and 
where; what the exchange is at, and as much about my friends 
and other matters as yon can [tell,] and think worthy of notice. 
Till I see you, 
</p><p>
Adieu ! 
</p><p>
N. B. Our correspondence is too far advanced to require 
apology for bad writing and blots. 
</p><p>
Your letter to Mr. Wallace is yet in my hands, and shall be 
forwarded to you as soon as possible. I hear nothing from him 
by letter or fame.
