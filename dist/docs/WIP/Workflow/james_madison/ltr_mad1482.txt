DEAR SIR, You only do me justice in ascribing your disappointment in the part of the week preceding your favor of 
the 16th instant to some other cause than my neglect. If I 
were less disposed to punctuality, your example would preserv.
me from transgressing it. As the last letter went to the postoffice here, and you did not receive it from the post in Virginia, 
the delinquency must have happened in that line. It is, however, I believe, of little consequence, as I do not recollect that 
anything material has been contained in my for several 
weeks, any more than there will be in this, in which I have 
little else to say than to tender you the compliments of the day. 
Perhaps, indeed, it will be new to you what appeared here in a 
paper several days ago, that the success of Commodore Johnstone in taking five Dutch East Indiamen, homeward bound, 
and destroying a sixth, is confirmed. Whatever may be thought 
of this stroke of fortune by him and his rapacious crew, the 
Ministry will hardly think it a compensation to the public for 
the danger to which the remains of their possessions in the East 
will be exposed by the failure of his expedition. 
</p><p>
It gives me great pleasure to hear of the honorable acquittal 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a>. I know his abilities, and I think I know his 
fidelity and zeal for his country so well, that I am persuaded it 
was a just one. We are impatient to know whether he will 
undertake the new serv.e to which he is called. 
I am, D'r Sir, yrs affectionately. 
</p>
