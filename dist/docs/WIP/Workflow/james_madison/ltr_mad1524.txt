</p><p>
DEAR SIR, I received the day before yesterday your favour 
of the 26th July. I had previously received the Report on the 
proposed change of the 9th article of the Confederation, transmitted by <a href='/results.php?tla=wlg' rel='acquaintance'>Col. Grayson</a>; and in my answer to him offered such 
ideas on the subject as then occurred. 
</p><p>
I still think the probability of success or failure ought to 
weigh much with Congress in every recommendation to the 
States; of which probability Congress, in whom information 
from every State centers, can alone properly judge. Viewing 
in the abstract the question whether the power of regulating 
trade, to a certain degree at least, ought to be vested in Congress, it appears to me not to admit of a doubt but that it 
should be decided in the affirmative. If it be necessary to regulate trade at all, it surely is necessary to lodge the power 
where trade can be regulated with effect; and experience has 
confirmed what reason foresaw, that it can never be so regulated by the States acting in their separate capacities. They can 
no more exercise this power separately than they could separately carry on war, or separately form treaties of alliance or 
commerce. The nature of the thing, therefore, proves the former power, no less than the latter, to be within the reason of 
the federal Constitution. 
</p><p>
Much, indeed, is it to be wished, as I conceive, that no regulations of trade, that is to say, no restrictions on imposts whatever, were necessary. A perfect freedom is the system which 
would be my choice. But before such a system will be eligible, 
perhaps, for the United States, they must be out of debt; before 
it will be attainable, all other nations must concur in it. Whilst 
any one of these imposes on our vessels, seamen, &c., in their 
ports, clogs from which they exempt their own, we must either 
retort the distinction, or renounce, not merely a just profit, but 
our only defence against the danger which may most easily beset us. Are we not at this moment under this very alternative? 
The policy of Great Britain (to say nothing of other nations) 
has shut against us the channels without which our trade with 
her must be a losing one; and she has consequently the triumph, 
as we have the chagrin, of seeing accomplished her prophetic 
threats, that our independence should forfeit commercial advantages for which it would not recompence us with any new channels of trade. 
</p><p>
What is to be done? Must we remain passive victims to foreign politics, or shall we exert the lawful means which our independence has put into our hands of extorting redress ? The 
very question would be an affront to every citizen who loves 
his country. What, then, are these means? Retaliating regulations of trade only. How are these to be effectuated ? Only 
by harmony in the measures of the States. How is this harmony 
to be obtained? Only by an acquiescence of all the States in 
the opinion of a reasonable majority. If Congress, as they are 
now constituted, cannot be trusted with the power of digesting 
and enforcing this opinion, let them be otherwise constituted; 
let their numbers be increased, let them be chosen oftener, and 
let their period of serv.e be shortened; or if any better medium 
than Congress can be proposed by which the wills of the States 
may be concentered, let it be substituted; or lastly, let no regulation of trade adopted by Congress be in force until it shall 
have been ratified by a certain proportion of the States. But 
let us not sacrifice the end to the means; let us not rush on certain ruin in order to avpid a possible danger. 
</p><p>
I conceive it to be of great importance that the defects of the 
federal system should be amended, not only because such amendments will make it better answer the purpose for which it was 
instituted, but because I apprehend danger to its very existence 
from a continuance of defects which expose a part, if not the 
whole, of the empire to severe distress. The suffering part, 
even when the minor part, cannot long respect a Government 
which is too feeble to protect their interests; but when the suffering part comes to be the major part, and they despair of seeing a protecting energy given to the General Government, from 
what motives is their allegiance to be any longer expected? 
Should Great Britain persist in the machinations which distress 
us, and seven or eight of the States be hindered by the others 
from obtaining relief by federal means, I own I tremble at the 
anti-federal expedients into which the former may be tempted. 
</p><p>
As to the objection against entrusting Congress with a power 
over trade, drawn from the diversity of interests in the States, 
it may be answered: 1. That if this objection had been listened 
to, no confederation could have ever taken place among the 
States. 2. That if it ought now to be listened to, the power 
held by Congress of forming commercial treaties, by which 9 
States may indirectly dispose of the Commerce of the residue, 
ought to be immediately revoked. 3. That the fact is, that a 
case can scarcely be imagined in which it would be the interest 
of any two-thirds of the States to oppress the remaining one-third. 4. That the true question is, whether the commercial 
interests of the States do not meet in more points than they 
differ. To me it is clear that they do; and if they do, there are 
so many more reasons for than against submitting the commercial interest of each State to the direction and care of the majority. 
</p><p>
Put the West India trade alone, in which the interest of every 
State is involved, into the scale against all the inequalities which 
may result from any probable regulation by nine States, and 
who will say that the latter ought to preponderate? I have 
heard the different interest which the Eastern States have as 
carriers pointed out as a ground of caution to the Southern 
States, who have no bottoms of their own, against their concurring hastily in retaliations on Great Britain. But will the 
present system of Great Britain ever give the Southern States 
bottoms? and if they are not their own carriers, I should suppose it no mark either of folly or incivility to give our custom 
to our brethren, rather than to those who have not yet entitled 
themselves to the name of friends. 
</p><p>
In detailing these sentiments, I have nothing more in view 
than to prove the readiness with which I obey your request. 
As far as they are just, they must have been often suggested in 
the discussions of Congress on the subject. I cannot even give 
them weight by saying that I have reason to believe they would 
be relished in the public Councils of this State. From the trials 
of which I have been a witness, I augur that great difficulties 
will be encountered in every attempt to prevail on the Legislature to part with power. The thing itself is not only unpalatable, but the arguments which plead for it have not their full 
force on minds unaccustomed to consider the interests of the 
State as they are interwoven with those of the Confederacy, 
much less as they may be affected by foreign politics; whilst 
those which plead against it are not only specious, but in their 
nature popular, and for that reason sure of finding patrons. 
</p><p>
Add to all this, that the Mercantile interest, which has taken 
the lead in rousing the public attention of other States, is in 
this so exclusively occupied in British Commerce, that what 
little weight they have will be most likely to fall into the opposite scale. The only circumstance which promises a favorable 
hearing to the meditated proposition of Congress is, that the 
power which it asks is to be exerted against Great Britain, and 
the proposition will consequently be seconded by the animosities 
which still prevail in a strong degree against her. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear sir, very sincerely, your friend and serv.
