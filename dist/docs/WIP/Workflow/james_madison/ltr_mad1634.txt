SIR, Being informed that reports prevail not only that I am 
opposed to any amendments whatever to the new federal Constitution, but that I have ceased to be a friend to the rights of 
conscience; and inferring from a conversation with my brother 
William that you are disposed to contradict such reports, as 
far as your knowledge of my sentiments may justify, I am led 
to trouble you with this communication of them. As a private 
citizen, it could not be my wish that erroneous opinions should 
be entertained with respect to either of those points, particularly with respect to religious liberty. But having been induced to offer my serv.es to this district as its representative 
in the federal Legislature, considerations of a public nature 
make it proper that, with respect to both, my principles and 
views should be rightly understood. 
</p><p>
I freely own that I have never seen in the Constitution, as it 
now stands, those serv.us dangers which have alarmed many 
respectable Citizens. Accordingly, whilst it remained unratified, and it was necessary to unite the States in some one plan, 
I opposed all previous alterations as calculated to throw the 
States into dangerous contentions, and to furnish the secret enemies of the Union with an opportunity of promoting its dissolution. Circumstances are now changed. The Constitution is 
established on the ratifications of eleven States and a very great 
majority of the people of America; and amendments, if pursued 
with a proper moderation and in a proper mode, will be not 
only safe, but may serv.the double purpose of satisfying the 
minds of well meaning opponents, and of providing additional 
guards in favour of liberty. Under this change of circumstances, 
it is my sincere opinion that the Constitution ought to be revised, and that the first Congress meeting under it ought to 
prepare and recommend to the States for ratification the most 
satisfactory provisions for all essential rights, particularly the 
rights of conscience in the fullest latitude, the freedom of the 
press, trials by jury, security against general warrants, &c. I 
think it will be proper, also, to provide expressly in the Constitution for the periodical increase of the number of Representatives, until the amount shall be entirely satisfactory, and 
to put the judiciary department into such a form as will render 
vexatious appeals impossible. There are sundry other alterations which are either eligible in themselves, or, being at least 
safe, are recommended by the respect due to such as wish for them. 
</p><p>
I have intimated that the amendments ought to be proposed 
by the first Congress. I prefer this mode to that of a General 
Convention 1 st . Because it is the most expeditious mode. A 
Convention must be delayed until two-thirds of the State Legislatures shall have applied for one, and afterwards the amendments must be submitted to the States; whereas if the business 
be undertaken by Congress, the amendments may be prepared 
and submitted in March next. 2 dly . Because it is the most certain mode.' There are not a few States who will absolutely reject the proposal of a Convention, and yet not be averse to 
amendments in the other mode. Lastly. It is the safest mode. 
The Congress, who will be appointed to execute as well as to 
amend the Government, will probably be careful not to destroy 
or endanger it. A Convention, on the other hand, meeting in 
the present ferment of parties, and containing, perhaps, insidious characters from different parts of America, would at least 
spread a general alarm, and be but too likely to turn everything into confusion and uncertainty. It is to be observ., 
however, that the question concerning a General Convention 
will not belong to the federal Legislature. If two-thirds of the 
States apply for one, Congress cannot refuse to call it; if not, 
the other mode of amendments must be pursued.
