DEAR SIR, The Convention of New Hampshire have disappointed much the general expectation. Instead of adopting the 
Constitution, they have adjourned, without any final decision, 
until June, this expedient being found necessary to prevent a 
rejection. It seems that a majority of three or four members 
would have voted in the negative, but in this majority were a 
number who had been proselyted by the discussions, but were 
bound by positive instructions. These concurred with the federalists in the adjournment, and carried it by a majority of fifty-seven against forty-seven. It is not much doubted that, in the 
event, New Hampshire will be among the adopting States. But 
the influence of this check will be very considerable in this State, 
(<a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>,) and in several others. I have enquired whether 
June was preferred for the second meeting from any reference 
to Virginia or <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and am informed that it was merely 
an accommodation to the intermediate annual elections and 
Courts.
