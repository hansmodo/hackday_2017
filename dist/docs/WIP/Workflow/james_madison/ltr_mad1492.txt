MY DEAR FRIEND, Your favor of the 27th January was 
safely delivered to me about a fortnight ago, and was received 
with the greater pleasure, as it promises a continuance of your 
friendly attention. I am sorry that my situation enables me to 
stipulate no other return than sincere and thankful acknowledgments. 
</p><p>
On my arrival here, which happened early in December, I 
entered, as soon as the necessary attentions to my friends 
admitted, on the course of reading which I have long meditated. 
Coke Littleton, in consequence, and a few others from the same 
shelf, have been my chief society during the winter. My progress, which in so short a period could not have been great 
under the most favorable circumstances, has been much retarded 
by the want of some important books, and still more by that of 
some living oracle for occasional consultation. But what will 
be most noxious to my project, I am to incur the interruptions 
which will result from attendance in the Legislature, if the 
suffrage of my county should destine me for that serv.e, which 
I am made to expect will be the case. Among the circumstances which reconcile me to this destination, you need not be 
assured that the opportunity of being in your neighborhood has 
its full influence. 
</p><p>
I have perused, with both pleasure and edification, your observ.ions on the demand made by the Executive of South Carolina of a citizen of this State. If I were to hazard an opinion 
after yours, it would be that the respect due to the chief magistracy of a Confederate State, enforced as it is by the Articles of 
Union, requires an admission of the fact as it has been represented. If the representation be judged incomplete or ambiguous, explanations may certainly be called for; and if, on a 
final view of the charge, Virginia, should hold it to be not a 
casus fcederis, she will be at liberty to withhold her citizen, (at 
least upon that ground,) as South Carolina will be to appeal to 
the tribunal provided for all controversies among the States. 
Should the law of South Carolina happen to vary from the 
British law, the most difficult point of discussion, I apprehend, 
will be, whether the terms " treason," &c., are to be referred to 
those determinate offences so denominated in the latter code, or 
to all those to which the policy of the several States may annex 
the same titles and penalties. Much may be urged, I think, 
both in favor of and against each of these expositions. The 
two first of those terms, coupled with " breach of the peace," 
are used in the 5th article of the Confederation, but in a way 
that does not clear the ambiguity. The truth, perhaps, in this 
as in many other instances, is, that if the compilers of the text 
had severally declared their meanings, these would have been 
as diverse as the comments which will be made upon it. 
</p><p>
Waiving the doctrine of the Confederation, my present view 
of the subject would admit few exceptions to the propriety 
of surrendering fugitive offenders. My reasons are these: 1. 
By the express terms of the Union, the citizens of every State 
are naturalized within all the others, and being entitled to the 
same privileges, may with the more justice be subjected to the 
same penalties. This circumstance materially distinguishes the 
citizens of the United States from the subjects of other nations 
not so incorporated. 2. The analogy of the laws throughout 
the States, and particularly the uniformity of trial by juries of 
the vicinage, seem to obviate the capital objections against 
removal to the State where the offence is charged. In the 
instance of continuous States, a removal of the party accused 
from one to the other must often be a less grievance than what 
happens within the same State when the place of residence and 
the place where the offence is laid are at distant extremities. 
The transportation to Great Britain seems to have been reprobated on very different grounds ; it would have deprived the 
accused of the privilege of trial by jury of the vicinage, as well 
as of the use of his witnesses, and have exposed him to trial in 
a place where he was not even alledged to have ever made himself obnoxious to it ; not to mention the danger of unfairness 
arising from the circumstances which produced the regulation. 
3. Unless citizens of one State transgressing within the pale 
of another be given up to be punished by the latter, they cannot 
be punished at all ; and it seems to be a common interest of the 
States that a few hours, or at most a few days, should not be 
sufficient to gain a sanctuary for the authors of the numerous 
offences below "high misdemesnors." In a word, experience 
will shew, if I mistake not, that the relative situation of the 
United States calls for a "Droit Public" much more minute than 
that comprised in the federal articles, and which presupposes 
much greater mutual confidence and amity among the societies 
which are to obey it, than the law which has grown out of the 
transactions and intercourse of jealous and hostile nations. 
</p><p>
Present my respectful compliments to your amiable lady, and 
accept the sincerest wishes for your joint happiness of 
Your affec" friend and obt serv.

P. S. By my Brother who is charged with this, I send Chastellux's work, De la FelicM Publique, which you may perhaps 
find leisure to run through before May; also a notable work of 
one of the Representatives of the U. S. in Europe.
