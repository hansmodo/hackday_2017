DEAR SIR, After all the vicissitudes through which the assumption has passed, it seems at present in a fair way to succeed as part of the general plan for the public debt. The Senate 
have included it among their amendments to the funding bill, 
and a vote of yesterday in the House of Representatives indicates a small majority in favor of the measure. In its present 
form it will very little affect the interest of Virginia in either 
way. I have not been able to overcome my other objections, or 
even to forbear urging them. At the same time, I cannot deny 
that the crisis demands a spirit of accommodation to a certain 
extent. If the measure should be adopted, I shall wish it to be 
considered as an unavoidable evil, and possibly not the worst 
side of the dilemma.
