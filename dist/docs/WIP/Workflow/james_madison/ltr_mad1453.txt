TO JAMES MADISON, ESQ. [SR.]
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">PRINCETON</a>, October 9, <a href="/results.php?year=1771">1771</a>. 
</p><p>
HONORED SIR, In obedience to your requests I hereby send 
you an answer to yours of the 25th of September, which I 
received this morning. My letter by Dr. Witherspoon, who 
left this place yesterday week, contains most of what you desire 
to be informed of. I should be glad if your health and other 
circumstances should enable you to visit him during his stay in 
Virginia. I am persuaded you would be much pleased with 
him, and that he would be very glad to see you. 
</p><p>
I was so particular in my last with regard to my determination about staying in <a href="/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">PRINCETON</a> this winter coming, that I need 
say nothing more in this place, my sentiments being still the 
same. 
</p><p>
I am sorry Mr. Chew's mode of conveyance will not answer 
in Virginia. I expect to hear from him in a few days, by return 
of a man belonging to this Town from New <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, and shall 
then acquaint him with it and get it remedied by the methods 
you propose. 
</p><p>
Mr. James Martin was here at commencement, and had an 
opportunity of hearing from his brothers and friends in. Carolina by a young man lately come from thence to this college; 
however, I shall follow your directions in writing to him immediately, and visiting him as soon as I find it convenient. 
</p><p>
I am, Dr sir, your affectionate son. 
</p>
