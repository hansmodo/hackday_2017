To the Honorable General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia : 
</p><p>
A MEMORIAL AND REMONSTRANCE. 
</p><p>
We, the subscribers, citizens of the said Commonwealth, having taken into serv.us consideration a Bill printed by order of 
the last session of General Assembly, entitled "A Bill establishing a provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion," and 
conceiving that the same, if finally armed with the sanctions of 
a law, will be a dangerous abuse of power, are bound as faithful 
members of a free State to remonstrate against it, and to declare the reasons by which we are determined. We remonstrate 
against the said Bill 
</p><p>
1. Because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable 
truth, " that Religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, 
and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence."* The Religion, 
then, of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience 
of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it, as 
these may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable 
right. It is unalienable, because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds, 
cannot follow the dictates of other men. It is unalienable, also, 
because what is here a right towards men is a duty towards the 
Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator 
such homage, and such only, as he believes to be acceptable to 
him. This duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil society. Before any 
man can be considered as a member of Civil Society, he must 
be considered as a subject of the Governor of the Universe; 
and if a member of Civil Society who enters into any subordi
* Declaration Rights, Article 1C.  
</p><p>
nate Association must always do it with a reserv.ion of his 
duty to the General Authority, much more must every man who 
becomes a member of any particular Civil Society do it with a 
saving of his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign. We maintain, therefore, that in matters of Religion no man's right is 
abridged by the institution of Civil Society, and that Religion 
is wholly exempt from its cognizance. True it is, that no other 
rule exists by which any question which may divide a Society 
can be ultimately determined than the will of the majority ; but 
it is also true that the majority may trespass on the rights of 
the minority. 
</p><p>
2. Because, if Religion be exempt from the authority of the 
Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body. The latter are but the creatures and vicegerents 
of the former. Their jurisdiction is both derivative and limited. It is limited with regard to the co-ordinate departments; 
more necessarily is it limited with regard to the constituents. 
The preserv.ion of a free Government requires, not merely 
that the metes and bounds which separate each department of 
power be invariably maintained, but more especially that 
neither of them be suffered to overleap the great Barrier which 
defends the rights of the people. The rulers who are guilty of 
such an encroachment exceed the commission from which they 
derive their authority, and are Tyrants. The people who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves nor 
by an authority derived from them, and are slaves. 
</p><p>
3. Because it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment 
on our liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first 
duty of citizens, and one of the noblest characteristics of the 
late Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till 
usurped power had strengthened 'itself by exercise, and entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the consequences 
in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by denying 
the principle. We revere this lesson too much soon to forget 
it. Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish, with the same ease, any particular sect of Christians, in 
exclusion of all other sects? that the same authority which can 
force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property 
for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever? 
</p><p>
4. Because the Bill violates that equality which ought to be 
the basis of every law, and which is more indispensable in proportion as the validity or expediency of any law is more liable 
to be impeached. "If all men are by nature equally free and 
independent,"* all men are to be considered as entering into 
Society on equal conditions; as relinquishing no more, and 
therefore retaining no less, one than another, of their natural 
rights. Above all, are they to be considered as retaining an 
" equal title to the free exercise of Religion according to the 
dictates of conscience, "f Whilst we asserv.for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess, and to observ. the Religion which 
we believe to be of divine origin, we cannot deny an equal freedom to them whose minds have not yet yielded to the evidence 
which has convinced us. If this freedom be abused, it is an 
offence against God, not against man. To God, therefore, not 
to man, must an account of it be rendered. As the bill violates 
equality by subjecting some to peculiar burdens, so it violates 
the same principle by granting to others peculiar exemptions. 
Are the Quakers and Menonists the only Sects who think a compulsive support of their Religions unnecessary and unwarrantable? Can their piety alone be entrusted with the care of 
public worship ? Ought their Religions to be endowed above 
all others with extraordinary privileges, by which proselytes 
may be enticed from all others? We think too favourably of 
the justice and good sense of these denominations to believe 
that they either covet pre-eminences over their fellow-citizens, 
or that they will be seduced by them from the common opposition to the measure. 
</p><p>
5. Because the Bill implies, either that the civil Magistrate 
is a competent Judge of Religious truths, or that he may employ Religion as an engine of civil policy. The first is an arro
* Declaration Rights, article 1. f Article 16, 
</p><p>
gant pretension, falsified by the contradictory opinions of Rulers 
in all ages, and throughout the world; the second, an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation. 
</p><p>
6. Because the. establishment proposed by the Bill is not 
requisite for the support of the Christian Religion. To say 
that it is, is a contradiction to the Christian Religion itself, for 
every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers of this 
world. It is a contradiction to fact, for it is known that this 
Religion both existed and flourished, not only without the support of human laws, but in spite of every opposition from them; 
and not only during the period of miraculous aid, but long after 
it had been left to its own evidence and the ordinary care of 
providence. Nay, it is a contradiction in terms; for a Religion 
not invented by human policy must have pre-existed and been 
supported before it was established by human policy. It is, 
moreover, to weaken in those who profess this Religion a pious 
confidence in its innate excellence and the patronage of its 
Author; and to foster in those who still reject it a suspicion 
that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies to trust it to its 
own merits. 
</p><p>
7. Because experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation 1 . During almost fifteen 
Centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on 
trial. What have been its fruits? More or less, in all places, 
pride and indolence in the Clergy; ignorance and serv.ity in 
the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry, and persecution. Enquire of the Teachers of Christianity for the ages in which it 
appeared in its greatest lustre; those of every Sect point to the 
ages prior to its incorporation with civil policy. Propose a 
restoration of this primitive state, in which its Teachers depended on the voluntary rewards of their flocks; many of them 
predict its downfall. On which side ought their testimony to 
have greatest weight; when for or when against their interest? 
</p><p>
8. Because the establishment in question is not necessary for 
the support of Civil Government. If it be urged as necessary 
for the support of Civil Government only as it is a means of 
supporting Religion, and it be not necessary for the latter purpose, it cannot be necessary for the former. If Religion be not 
within the cognizance of Civil Government, how can its legal 
establishment be necessary to Civil Government? What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on Civil 
Society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a 
spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority; in many 
instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political 
tyranny; in no instance have they been seen the guardians of 
the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the 
public liberty may have found an established Clergy convenient 
auxiliaries. A just Government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it, needs them not. Such a Government will be best 
supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his 
Religion with the same equal hand which protects his person 
and his property; by neither invading the equal rights of any 
Sect, nor suffering any sect to invade those of another. 
</p><p>
Because the proposed establishment is a departure from that 
generous policy which, offering an Asylum to the persecuted 
and oppressed of every Nation and Religion, promised a lustre 
to our country, and an accession to the number of its citizens. 
What a melancholy mark is the Bill of sudden degeneracy! 
Instead of holding forth an Asylum to the persecuted, it is itself a signal of persecution. It degrades from the equal rank 
of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to 
those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may be in its 
present form from the Inquisition, it differs from it only in degree. The one is the first step, the other the last, in the career 
of intolerance. The magnanimous sufferer under this cruel 
scourge in foreign Regions must view the Bill as a Beacon on 
our Coast warning him to seek some other haven, where liberty and philanthropy, in their due extent, may offer a more 
certain repose from his troubles. 
</p><p>
Because it will have a like tendency to banish our citizens. 
The allurements presented by other situations are every day 
thinning their number. To superadd a fresh motive to emigration by revoking the liberty which they now enjoy would be 
the same species of folly which has dishonoured and depopulated 
flourishing kingdoms. 
</p><p>
Because it will destroy that moderation and harmony which 
the forbearance of our laws to intermeddle with Religion has 
produced among its several Sects. Torrents of blood have been 
spilt in the old world in consequence of vain attempts of the 
secular arm to extinguish Religious discord by proscribing all 
differences in Religious opinion. Time has at length revealed 
the true remedy. Every relaxation of narrow and rigorous 
policy, wherever it has been tried, has been found to assuage 
the disease. The American theatre has exhibited proofs that 
equal and complete liberty, if it does not wholly eradicate it, 
sufficiently destroys its malignant influence on the health and 
prosperity of the State. If, with the salutary effects of this 
system under our own eyes, we begin to contract the bounds of 
Religious freedom, we know no name which will too severely 
reproach our folly. At least, let warning be taken at the first 
fruits of the threatened innovation. The very appearance of 
the Bill has transformed "that Christian forbearance, love, and 
charity,"* which of late mutually prevailed, into animosities 
and jealousies, which may not soon be appeased. What mischiefs may not be dreaded, should this enemy to the public quiet 
be armed with the force of a law? 
</p><p>
Because the policy of the Bill is adverse to the diffusion of 
the light of Christianity. The first wish of those who enjoy 
this precious gift ought to be, that it may be imparted to the 
whole race of mankind. Compare the number of those who 
have as yet received it with the number still remaining under 
the dominion of false Religions, and how small is the former ! 
Does the policy of the Bill tend to lessen the disproportion? 
No; it at once discourages those who are strangers to the light 
of revelation from coming into the Region of it, and countenances by example the nations who continue in darkness in 
shutting out those who might convey it to them. Instead of 
levelling, as far as possible, every obstacle to the victorious 
</p><p>
* Declaration Eights, Article 16. 
progress of truth, the Bill, with an ignoble and unchristian timidity, would circumscribe it with a wall of defence against the 
encroachments of error. 
</p><p>
Because attempts to enforce, by legal sanctions, acts obnoxious to so great a proportion of citizens, tend to enervate the 
laws in general, and to slacken the bands of Society. If it be 
difficult to execute any law which is not generally deemed necessary or salutary, what must be the case where it is deemed invalid and dangerous ? And what may be the effect of so striking 
an example of impotency in the Government on its general authority? 
</p><p>
Because a measure of such singular magnitude and delicacy 
ought not to be imposed without the clearest evidence that it is 
called for by a majority of citizens; and no satisfactory method 
is yet proposed by which the voice of the majority in this case 
may be determined, or its influence secured. "The people of 
the respective Counties are, indeed, requested to signify their 
opinion respecting the adoption of the Bill to the next Session 
of the Assembly." But the representation must be made equal 
before the voice either of the Representatives or of the Counties 
will be that of the people. Our hope is, that neither of the former will, after due consideration, espouse the dangerous principle of the Bill. Should the event disappoint us, it will still 
leave us in full confidence that a fair appeal to the latter will 
reverse the sentence against our liberties. 
</p><p>
Because, finally, " the equal right of every Citizen to the free 
exercise of his Religion, according to the dictates of conscience," 
is held by the same tenure with all our other rights. If we 
recur to its origin, it is equally the gift of nature; if we weigh 
its importance, it cannot be less dear to us; if we consult the 
Declaration of those rights "which pertain to the good people 
of Virginia as the basis and foundation of Government,"* it is 
enumerated with equal solemnity, or rather with studied emphasis. Either, then, we must say, that the will of the Legislature 
is the only measure of their authority, and that in the plenitude 
of that authority they may sweep away all our fundamental 
rights, or that they are bound to leave this particular right 
untouched and sacred. Either we must say, that they may controul the freedom of the press, may abolish the trial by jury, 
may swallow up the Executive and Judiciary powers of the 
State; nay, that they may despoil us of our very right of suffrage, and erect themselves into an independent and hereditary 
Assembly; or we must say, that they have no authority to enact 
into a law the Bill under consideration. 
</p><p>
"We, the subscribers, say that the General Assembly of this 
Commonwealth have no such authority. And in order that no 
effort may be omitted on our part against so dangerous an usurpation, we oppose to it this remonstrance; earnestly praying, 
as we are in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the 
Universe, by illuminating those to whom it is addressed, may, 
on the one hand, turn their councils from every act which would 
affront his holy prerogative, or violate the trust committed to 
them; and on the other, guide them into every measure which 
may be worthy of his blessing, redound to their own praise, and 
establish more firmly the liberties, the prosperity, and the happiness of the Commonwealth.
