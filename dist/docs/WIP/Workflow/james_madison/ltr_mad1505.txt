DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 15th instant came to hand by 
thursday's post. Mine by the last post acknowledged your preceding one. The umbrage given to the Commissioners of the 
United States by the negociations of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> with the Indians was not altogether unknown to me, though I am less acquainted with the circumstances of it than your letter supposes. 
The idea which I at present have of the affair leads me to say, 
that as far as <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> may claim a right of treating with Indians for the purchase of lands within her limits, she has the 
Confederation on her side; as far as she may have exerted that 
right in contravention of the General Treaty, or even unconfidentially with the Commissioners of Congress, she has violated 
both duty and decorum. The federal Articles give Congress the 
exclusive right of managing all affairs with the Indians not mem~bers of any State, under a proviso, that the Legislative authority 
of the State within its own limits be not violated. By Indians 
not members of a State, must be meant those, I conceive, who 
do not live within the body of the Society, or whose persons or 
property form no objects of its laws. In the case of Indians of 
this description, the only restraint on Congress is imposed by 
the Legislative authority of the State. 
</p><p>
If this proviso be taken in its full latitude, it must destroy 
the authority of Congress altogether, since no act of Congress 
within the limits of a State can be conceived which will not in 
some way or other encroach upon the authority of the State. 
In order, then, to give some meaning to both parts of the sentence, as a known rule of interpretation requires, we must restrain this proviso to some particular view of the parties. What 
was this view ? My answer is, that it was to save to the States 
their right of pre-emption of lands from the Indians. My reasons are: 1. That this was the principal right formerly exerted 
by the Colonies with regard to the Indians. 2. That it was a 
right asserv.d by the laws as well as the proceedings of all of 
them, and therefore, being most familiar, would be most likely 
to be in contemplation of the parties. 3. That being of most 
consequence to the States individually, and least inconsistent 
with the general powers of Congress, it was most likely to be 
made a ground of compromise. 4. It has been always said that 
the proviso came from the Virginia Delegates, who would naturally be most vigilant over the territorial rights of their constituents. But whatever may be the true boundary between 
the authority of Congress and that of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, or however 
indiscreet the latter may have been, I join entirely with you in 
thinking that temperance on the part of the former will be the 
wisest policy. 
</p><p>
I concur with you equally with regard to the ignominious 
secession at <a href="/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>. As Congress are too impotent to punish such offences, the task must finally be left to the States, and 
experience has shewn, in the case of Howell, that the interposition of Congress against an offender, instead of promoting his 
chastisement, may give him a significancy which he otherwise 
would never arrive at, and may induce a State to patronize an 
act which of their own accord they would have punished. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to find the affair of Mr. de Marbois taking so serv.us a face. As the insult was committed within the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania, I think you are right in supposing the 
offender could not be transferred to another jurisdiction for 
punishment. The proper questions, therefore, are: 1. Whether 
the existing law was fully put in force against him by Pennsylvania? 2. Whether due provision has been made by that State 
against like contingencies ? Nothing seems to be more difficult 
under our new Governments than to impress on the attention 
of our Legislatures a due sense of those duties which spring 
from our relation to foreign nations. 
</p><p>
Several of us have been labouring much of late in the General 
Assembly here to provide for a case with which we are every 
day threatened by the eagerness of our disorderly citizens for 
Spanish plunder and Spanish blood. It has been proposed to 
authorise Congress, whenever satisfactory proof shall be given 
to them by a foreign power of such a crime being committed by 
our citizens within its jurisdiction as by the law of Nations calls 
for a surrender of the offender, and the foreign power shall 
actually make the demand, [to require his surrender from the 
Executive of the State,] and that the Executive may, at the instance of Congress, apprehend and deliver up the offender. 
That there are offences of that class is clearly stated by Vattel 
in particular, and that the business ought to pass through' Congress is equally clear. The proposition was a few days ago 
rejected in Committee of the whole. To-day, on the report of 
the Committee, it has been agreed to by a small majority. This 
is the most material question that has agitated us during the 
week past. 
</p><p>
The Bill for a Religious Assessment has not been yet brought 
in. <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>, the father of the scheme, is gone up to his seat 
for his family, and will no more sit in the House of Delegates 
a circumstance very inauspicious to his offspring. An attempt 
will be made for Circuit Courts, and Mr. Jones has it in contemplation to try whether any change has taken place in the sentiments of the House of Delegates on the subject of the Treaty. 
He will write to you by this post, and I refer to him for what I 
may have omitted.

With sincere regard and esteem, I am, dear sir, your friend 
and serv. .
