DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
I do not wonder at the paragraph which you have copied from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a>'s letter to Congress. His feelings are such as every 
one must possess who is worthy of the station which he holds. 
If the Office of foreign affairs be a proper one, and properly 
filled, a reference of all foreign despatches to it in the first instance is so obvious a course, that any other disposition of them 
by Congress seems to condemn their own establishment, to affront the Minister in office, and to put on him a label of caution 
against that respect and confidence of the Ministers of foreign 
powers which are essential to his usefulness. I have always 
conceived the several ministerial departments of Congress to 
be provisions for aiding their counsels as well as executing 
their resolutions, and that consequently, whilst they retain the 
right of rejecting the advice which may come from either of 
them, they ought not to renounce the opportunity of making use 
of it. The foreign department is, I am sensible, in several respects the most difficult to be regulated, but I cannot think the 
question arising on <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a>'s letter is to be numbered among 
the difficulties. The practice of Congress during the administration of his predecessor was never fixed, and frequently improper, and I always suspected that his indifference to the place 
resulted, in part at least, from the mortifications to which this 
unsteadiness subjected him. 
</p><p>
You will not be disappointed at the barrenness which is hence 
to mark the correspondence on my part. In the recess of the 
Legislature few occurrences happen which can be interesting, 
and, in my retired situation, few even of these fall within my 
knowledge. The situation of Mr. Jones will probably make 
his correspondence a more productive one. He has probably 
already mentioned to you the advances which Kentucky was 
said to be making towards an independent Government. It is 
certain that a Convention has been held, which might have been 
set on foot with an eye to such an event; but I learn from an 
intelligent person lately from that district, that its deliberations 
turned altogether on the pressure of certain acts of the General 
Assembly, and terminated in a vote of application for redress. 
He supposes, however, that the late extension of the tax on 
patents will give a successful handle to those who wish to accelerate a separation. This tax as it stood before was in the first 
class of their grievances. 
</p><p>
You will, I expect, receive this from the hands of Mr. Burnley, a young gentleman of my neighborhood, who has passed 
with reputation thro' Mr. Wythe's School, and has since taken 
out his forensic diploma. Your civilities to him will be well 
placed, and will confer an obligation on me. If Col. Gray son 
has recovered from the gout, which, I hear, arrested him in the 
moment of his intended departure, and is with you, be so kind 
as to make my best respects to him. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, with sincere regard and esteem, your obedient 
friend and serv.
