</p><p>
DEAR SIR, I have been honored with your letter of the 31 
March, and find, with much pleasure, that your views of the reform which ought to be pursued by the Convention give a 
sanction to those I entertained. Temporising applications will 
dishonor the councils which propose them, and may foment the 
internal malignity of the disease, at the same time that they 
produce an ostensible palliation of it. Radical attempts, although unsuccessful, will at least justify the authors of them. 
</p><p>
Having been lately led to revolve the subject which is to undergo the discussion of the Convention, and formed some outlines of a new system, I take the liberty of submitting them 
without apology to your eye. 
</p><p>
Conceiving that an individual independence of the States is 
utterly irreconcileable with their aggregate sovereignty, and 
that a consolidation of the whole into one simple republic would 
be as inexpedient as it is unattainable, I have sought for middle 
ground, which may at once support a due supremacy of the national authority, and not exclude the local authorities wherever 
they can be subordinately useful. 
</p><p>
I would propose as the groundwork, that a change be made 
in the principle of representation. According to the present 
form of the Union, in which the intervention of the States is in 
all great cases necessary to effectuate the measures of Congress, 
an equality of suffrage does not destroy the inequality of importance in the several members. No one will deny that Virginia and Massachusetts have more weight and influence, both 
within and without Congress, than Delaware or Rhode Island. 
Under a system which would operate in many essential points 
without the intervention of the State legislatures, the case would 
be materially altered. A vote in the national Councils from 
Delaware would then have the same effect and value as one 
from the largest State in the Union. I am ready to believe that 
such a change would not be attended with much difficulty. A*' 
majority of the States, and those of greatest influence, will regard it as favorable to them. To the northern States it will 
be recommended by their present populousness; to the Southern, by their expected advantage in this respect. The lesserv.
States must in every event yield to the predominant will. But 
the consideration which particularly urges a change in the representation is, that it will obviate the principal objections of 
the larger States to the necessary concessions of power. 
</p><p>
I would propose next, that in addition to the present federal 
powers, the national Government should be armed with positive 
and compleat authority in all cases which require uniformity; 
such as the regulation of trade, including the right of taxing 
both exports and imports, the fixing the terms and forms of 
naturalization, &c., &c. 
</p><p>
Over and above this positive power, a negative in all cases 
whatsoever on the Legislative acts of the States, as heretofore 
exercised by the Kingly prerogative, appears to me to be absolutely necessary, and to be the least possible encroachment on 
the State jurisdictions. Without this defensive power, every 
positive power that can be given on paper will be evaded or 
defeated. The States will continue to invade the National jurisdiction, to violate treaties and the law of nations, and to 
harass each other with rival and spiteful measures dictated by 
mistaken views of interest. Another happy effect of this prerogative would be its controul on the internal vicissitudes of 
State policy, and the aggressions of interested majorities on the 
rights of minorities and of individuals. The great desideratum, 
which has not yet been found for Republican Governments, 
seems to be some disinterested and dispassionate umpire in disputes between different passions and interests in the State. The 
majority, who alone have the right of decision, have frequently 
an interest, real or supposed, in abusing it. In Monarchies, the 
Sovereign is more neutral to the interests and views of different parties; but, unfortunately, he too often forms interests of 
his own, repugnant to those of the whole. Might not the national prerogative here suggested be found sufficiently disinterested for the decision of local questions of policy, whilst it 
would itself be sufficiently restrained from the pursuit of interests adverse to those of the whole society ? There has not been 
any moment since the peace at which the representatives of the 
Union would have given an assent to paper money, or any other 
measure of a kindred nature. 
</p><p>
The national supremacy ought also to be extended, as I conceive, to the Judiciary departments. If those who are to expound and apply the laws are connected by their interests and 
their oaths with the particular States wholly, and not with the 
Union, the participation of the Union in the making of the 
laws may be possibly rendered unavailing. It seems at least 
necessary that the oaths of the Judges should include a fidelity 
to the general as well as local Constitution, and that an appeal 
should lie to some National tribunal in all cases to which foreigners or inhabitants of other States may be parties. The admiralty jurisdiction seems to fall entirely within the purview 
of the National Government. 
</p><p>
The National supremacy in the Executive departments is liable to some difficulty, unless the officers administering them 
could be made appointable by the Supreme Government. The 
Militia ought certainly to be placed, in some form or other, under 
the authority which is entrusted with the general protection 
and defence. 
</p><p>
A Government composed of such extensive powers should be 
well organized and balanced. The legislative department 
might be divided into two branches; one of them chosen every 
years, by the people at large, or by the Legislatures; the 
other to consist of fewer members, to hold their places for a 
longer term, and to go out in such a rotation as always to leave 
in office a large majority of old members. Perhaps the negative on the laws might be most conveniently exercised by this 
branch. As a further check, a Council of revision, including 
the great ministerial officers, might be superadded. 
</p><p>
A National Executive must also be provided. I have scarcely 
ventured, as yet, to form my own opinion either of the manner 
in which it ought to be constituted, or of the authorities with 
which it ought to be cloathed. 
</p><p>
An article should be inserv.d expressly guarantying the tranquillity of the States against internal as well as external dangers. 
</p><p>
In like manner the right of coercion should be expressly declared. With the resources of commerce in hand, the National 
administration might always find means of exerting it either by 
sea or land. But the difficulty and awkwardness of operating 
by force on the collective will of a State render it particularly 
desirable that the necessity of it might be precluded. Perhaps 
the negative on the laws might create such a mutuality of dependence between the general and particular authorities as 
to answer this purpose. Or, perhaps, some defined objects of 
taxation might be submitted, along with commerce, to the general authority. 
</p><p>
To give a new system its proper validity and energy, a ratification must be obtained from the people, and not merely from 
the ordinary authority of the Legislatures. This will be the 
more essential, as inroads on the existing Constitutions of the 
States will be unavoidable. 
</p><p>
The inclosed address to the States on the subject of the Treaty 
of peace has been agreed to by Congress, and forwarded to the 
several Executives. We foresee the irritation which it will excite in many of our Countrymen, but could not withhold our 
approbation of the measure. Both the resolutions and the address passed without a dissenting voice. 
</p><p>
Congress continue to be thin, and of course do little business 
of importance. The settlement of the public accounts, the disposition of the public lands, and arrangements with Spain, are 
subjects which claim their particular attention. As a step 
towards the first, the Treasury board are charged with the task 
of reporting a plan by which the final decision on the claims of 
the States will be handed over from Congress to a select set of 
men, bound by their oaths, and cloathed with the powers of 
Chancellors. As to the second article, Congress have it themselves under consideration. Between six and seven hundred 
thousand acres have been surveyed and are ready for sale. The 
mode of sale, however, will probably be a source of different 
opinions, as will the mode of disposing of the unsurveyed residue. The Eastern gentlemen remain attached to the scheme 
of townships. Many others are equally strenuous for indiscriminate locations. The States which have lands of their own for 
sale are suspected of not being hearty in bringing the federal 
lands to market. The business with Spain is becoming extremely delicate, and the information from the Western settlements truly alarming. 
</p><p>
A motion was made some days ago for an adjournment of 
Congress for a short period, and an appointment of <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
for their reassembling. The eccentricity of this place, as well 
with regard to East and West as to North and South, has, I 
find, been for a considerable time a thorn in the minds of many 
of the Southern members. Suspicion, too, has charged some 
important votes on the weight thrown by the present position 
of Congress into the Eastern scale, and predicts that the Eastern members will never concur in any substantial provision or 
movement for a proper permanent seat for the National Government, whilst they remain so much gratified in its temporary 
residence. These seem to have been the operative motives with 
those on one side who were not locally interested in the removal. On the other side, the motives are obvious. Those of 
real weight were drawn from the apparent caprice with which 
Congress might be reproached, and particularly from the peculiarity of the existing moment. 
</p><p>
I own that I think so much regard due to these considerations, that notwithstanding the principal ones on the other side, 
I should have assented with great reluctance to the motion, and 
would even have voted against it, if any probability had existed 
that, by waiting for a proper time, a proper measure might not 
be lost for a very long time. The plan which I should have 
judged most eligible would have been to fix on the removal 
whenever a vote could be obtained, but so as that it should not 
take effect until the commencement of the ensuing federal year. 
And if an immediate removal had been resolved on, I had intended to propose such a change in the plan. No final question 
was taken in the case. Some preliminary questions showed that 
six States were in favor of the motion. Rhode Island, the 
seventh, was at first on the same side, and Mr. Yarnum, one of 
the delegates, continues so. His colleague was overcome by the 
solicitations of his Eastern brethren. As neither Maryland nor 
South Carolina was on the floor, it seems pretty evident that 
<a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> has a very precarious tenure of the advantages derived from the abode of Congress. 
</p><p>
We understand that the discontents in Massachusetts, which 
lately produced an appeal to the sword, are now producing a 
trial of strength in the field of electioneering. The Governor 
will be displaced. The Senate is said to be already of a popular complexion, and it is expected that the other branch will be 
still more so. Paper money, it is surmised, will be the engine 
to be played off against creditors, both public and private. As 
the event of the elections, however, is not yet decided, this information must be too much blended with conjecture to be regarded as matter of certainty. 
</p><p>
I do not learn that the proposed act relating to Yermont has 
yet gone through all the stages of legislation here; nor can I 
say whether it will finally pass or not. In truth, it having not 
been a subject of conversation for some time, I am unable to 
say what has been done or is likely to be done with it.

Notes of Ancient and Modern Confederacies, preparatory to the 
federal Convention of <a href="/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>.* 
</p><p>
In this confederacy, the number of votes allotted to each 
member was proportioned to its pecuniary contributions. The 
Judges and town magistrates were elected by the general 
authority in like proportion. 
</p><p>
See Monfofifl"io" who prefers this mode. 
</p><p>
The name of a federal republic may be refused to Lycia, 
which Montesquieu cites as an example in which the importance 
of the members determined the proportion of their votes in the 
general councils. The Grison League is a juster example.

Seated first at Thermopyla3, then at Delphos, afterwards at 
these places alternately. It met half yearly, to wit, in the 
Spring and Fall, besides extraordinary occasions. Id. In the 
latter meetings, all such of the Greeks as happened to be at 
Delphos on a religious errand were admitted to deliberate, but 
not to vote. Encyclopedic. 
</p><p>
The number and names of the confederated cities differently 
reported. The union seems to have consisted originally of the 
Delphians and their neighbors only, and by degrees to have 
comprehended all Greece. 10, 11, 12, are the different numbers 
of original members mentioned by different authors. Code de 
1'Humanite. 
</p><p>
Each city sent two deputies ; one to attend particularly to 
Religious matters, the other to civil and criminal matters 
affecting individuals ; both to decide on matters of a general 
nature. Id. Sometimes more than two were sent, but they 
had two votes only. Encyclopedie. 
</p><p>
The Amphictyons took an oath mutually to defend and protect the united cities, to inflict vengeance on those who should 
sacrilegiously despoil the temple of Delphos, to punish the 
violators of this oath, and never to divert the water-courses of 
any of the Amphictyonic cities, either in peace or in war. Code

The defect of subjection in the members to the general authority ruined the whole Body. The Romans seduced the members from the League by representing that it violated their 
sovereignty. Code de 1'Hum.

After the death of Alexander, this Union was dissolved by 
various dissentions, raised chiefly thro' the acts of the Kings of 
Macedon. Every city was now engaged in a separate interest, 
and no longer acted in concert. Polyb., lib. 2, cap 3. After, 
in 124 Olymp d , they saw their error, and began to think of returning to their former State. This was the time when Pyrrhus 
invaded Italy. Ibid.

Commenced in 1308 by the temporary and in 1315 by the 
perpetual Union of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwald, for the defence of their liberties against the invasions of the' House of 
Austria. In 1315 the Confederacy included 8 Cantons. In 
1513 the number of thirteen was compleated by the accession 
of Appenzel. Code de 1'Hum.

All general Diets are held at such time and place as Zurich, 
which is first in rank and the depository of the common archives, 
shall name in a circular summons. But the occasion of annual 
conferences for the administration of their dependent bailages 
has fixed the same time, to wit, the feast of St. John, for the 
General Diet, and the city of Frauenfeld, in Turgovia, is now 
the place of meeting. Formerly it was the city of Baden. Id. 
</p><p>
The Diet is opened by a complimentary address of the first 
deputy of each canton by turns, called the Helvetic salutation. 
It consists in a congratulatory review of circumstances and 
events favorable to their common interest, and exhortations to 
Union and patriotism. 
</p><p>
The deputies of the first canton, Zurich, propose the matters 
to be discussed. Questions are decided by plurality of voices. 
In case of division, the Bailiff of Turgovia has the casting one. 
The session of the Diet continues about a month. Id. 
</p><p>
After the objects of universal concern are despatched, such 
of the deputies whose constituents have no share in the dependent bailages withdraw, and the Diet then becomes a representation of the cantons to whom these bailages belong, and proceeds to the consideration of the business relating thereto. Id.

The 13 cantons do, not make one Commonwealth like the 
United Provinces, but are so many independent Commonwealths in strict alliance. There is not so much as any common instrument by which they are all reciprocally bound 
together. The 3 primitive cantons alone being each directly 
allied to the other twelve. The others, in many instances, are 
connected indirectly only, as allies of allies. In this mode, 
any one canton may draw in all the others to make a common 
cause in its defence. Stanyan.

The confederacy has no common Treasury, no common troops,

The General Diet cannot terminate any interesting affair

</p><p>
The Cantons individually exercise the right of sending and 
receiving ambassadors, making treaties, coining money, proscribing the money of one another, prohibiting the importation 
and exportation of merchandise, furnishing troops to foreign 
States, and doing everything else which does not wound the 
liberty of any other canton. Excepting a few cases specified 
in the alliances, and which directly concern the object of the 
league, no canton is subject to the Resolutions of the plurality. Id. 
</p><p>
The only establishment truly national is that of a federal 
army, as regulated in 1668, and which is no more than an eventual plan of defence adopted among so many allied States. Id. 
</p><p>
1. The league consists in a perpetual defensive engagement 
against external attacks and internal troubles. It may be regarded as an axiom in the public law of the confederacy, that 
the federal engagements are precedent to all other political 
engagements of the cantons. Id. 
</p><p>
2. Another axiom is, that there are no particular or common 
possessions of the cantons for the defence of which the others 
are not bound as Guarantees, or auxiliaries of Guarantees. Id. 
</p><p>
3. All disputes are to be submitted to neutral cantons, who 
may employ force, if necessary, in execution of their decrees. 
Id. Each party to choose 4 Judges, who may, in case of disagreement, choose umpire, and these, under oath of impartiality, to pronounce definitive sentence, which all cantons are to 
enforce. D'Albon and Stanyan. 
</p><p>
4. No canton ought to form new alliances without the consent of the others ; [this was stipulated in consequence of an 
improper alliance in 1442, by Zurich, with the House of Austria.] Id. 
</p><p>
5. It is an essential object of the league to preserv.interior 
tranquillity by the reciprocal protection of the form of Government established in each Canton, so that each is armed with the 
force of the whole corps for the suppression of rebellions and 
revolts, and the history of Switzerland affords frequent instances of mutual succors for these purposes. Diet" de Suisse. 
</p><p>
6. The Cantons are bound not to give shelter to fugitives 
from Justice, in consequence of which each Canton can at this 
day banish malefactors from all the territories of the League. 
Id. 
</p><p>
7. Though each Canton may prohibit the exportation and 
importation of merchandise, it must allow it to pass through 
from one neighboring Canton to another without any augmentation of the tolls. Code de 1'Hum. 
</p><p>
8. In claiming succours against foreign powers, the 8 Elder 
Cantons have a more extensive right than the 5 junior ones. 
The former may demand them of one another without explaining the motives of the quarrel. The latter cannot intermeddle

their adversaries, cannot refuse to accept the other Cantons for

9. In general, each Canton is to pay its own forces, without 
compensation from the whole, or the succoured party. But in 
case a siege is to be formed for the benefit of a particular Canton, this is to defray the expence of it, and if for the common 
benefit, each is to pay its just proportion. D'Albon. On no 
pretext is a Canton to be forced to march its troops out of the 
limits of Switzerland. Stanyan.

In a treaty in 1683 with Victor Amadceus, of Savoy, it is stipulated that he shall interpose as mediator in disputes between 
the Cantons, and, if necessary, use force against the party refusing to submit to the sentence. Dict re de Suisse. A striking 
proof of the want of authority in the whole over its parts.

Established in 1679, by the Treaty called the Union of 
Utrecht. Code de I'Humanite. 
</p><p>
The provinces came into this Union slowly. Guelderland, 
the smallest of them, made many difficulties. Even some of the 
Cities and Towns pretended to annex conditions to their acceding. Id. 
</p><p>
"When the Union was originally established, a committee, composed of deputies from each province, was appointed to regulate 
affairs, and to convoke the provinces according to article XIX 
of the Treaty. Out of this Committee grew the States General, (Id.,) who, strictly speaking, are only the Representatives 
of the States General, who amount to 800 members. Temple, 
p. 112. 
</p><p>
The number of Deputies to the States General from each province not limited, but have only a single voice. They amount 
commonly, altogether, to 40 or 50. They hold their seats, some 
for life, some for 6, 3, and 1 years, and those of Groningen and 
Overyssel during pleasure. They are paid, but very moderately, by their respective constituents, and are amenable to their 
Tribunals only. Code de 1'Hum. No military man is deputable to the States General. Id.

They sit constantly at the Hague since 1593, and every day 
in the week except Saturday and Sunday. The States of Holland, in granting this residence, reserv. by way of protestation, 
the rights, the honors, and prerogatives, belonging to them as 
sovereigns of the province, yiejding the States General only a 
rank in certain public ceremonies. Id. 
</p><p>
The eldest deputy from each province presides for a week by 
turns. The President receives, &c., from the Ministers 
of the Republic at foreign Courts, and of foreign Ministers residing at the Hague, as well as of all petitions presented to the 
Assembly; all which he causes to be read by the Secretary. Id. 
</p><p>
The Secretary, besides correcting and recording the Resolutions, prepares and despatches instructions to Ministers abroad, 
andto foreign powers. He assists, also, at conferences 
held with foreign Ministers, and there gives his voice. He has a 
deputy when there is not a second Secretary. The agent of the 
States General is charged with the Archives, and is also employed on occasions of receiving foreign Ministers or sending 
Messages to them. Id.

The Union of Utrecht imports an authority in the States General seemingly sufficient to secure harmony; but the jealousy in 
each province of its sovereignty renders the practice very different from the Theory. Code de 1'Hum. 
</p><p>
It is clear that the delay occasioned by recurring to seven 
independent provinces, including about 52 voting Cities, &c., is 
a vice in the Belgic Republic which exposes it to the most fatal 
inconveniences. Accordingly, the fathers of their country have 
endeavored to remedy it, in the extraordinary assemblies of the 
States General in 1584, in 1651, 1716, 1717, but, unhappily, 
without effect. This vice is, notwithstanding, deplorable. Id. 
Among other evils, it gives foreign Ministers the means of arresting the most important deliberations by gaining a single 
Province or City. This was done by France in 1726, when the 
Treaty of Hanover was delayed a whole year. In 1688 the 
States concluded a Treaty of themselves, but at the risk of their 
heads. Id. It is the practice, also, in matters of contribution 
or subsidy, to pass over this article of the Union; for where 
delay would be dangerous, the consenting provinces furnish 
their quotas without waiting for the others; but by such means 
the Union is weakened, and, if often repeated, must be dissolved. Id. 
</p><p>
Foreign Ministers elude matters taken ad referendum, by tampering with the Provinces and Cities. Temple, p. 116. 
</p><p>
Treaty of Union obliges each Province to levy certain contributions. But this article never could and probably never 
will be executed, because the inland provinces, who have little 
commerce, cannot pay an equal Quota. Burrish. Bat. illustrat.

Deputations from agreeing to disagreeing Provinces frequent. Tern.

It is certain that so many independent corps and interests 
could not be kept together without such a center of union as 
the Stadtholdership, as has been allowed and repeated in so 
many solemn acts. Code de FHum. 
</p><p>
In the intermission of the Stadtholdership, Holland, by her 
riches and authority, which drew the others into a sort of dependence, supplied the place. Temple. 
</p><p>
With such a Government the Union never could have subsisted, if, in effect, the provinces had not within themselves a 
spring capable of quickening their tardiness and impelling them 
to the same way of thinking. This spring is the Stadtholder. 
His prerogatives are immense 1, &c., <fec. A strange effect of 
human contradictions. Men too jealous to confide their liberty 
to their representatives, who are their equals, abandoned it to 
a Prince, who might the more easily abuse it, as the affairs of 
the Republic were important, and had not then fixed themselves. Mably Etude D'Hist., 2056.

Germanic Confederacy took its present form in the year

</p><p>
The Diet is to be convoked by the Emperor, or, on his failure, 
by the Archbishop of Mentz, with consent of Electors, once in 
ten years at least from the last adjournment, and six months 
before the time of meeting. Ratisbon is the seat of the Diet 
since 1663. 
</p><p>
The members amount to 285, and compose three colleges, to 
wit: that of the Electors, of Princes, of Imperial Cities. The 
voices amount to 159, of which 153 are individual and 6 collective. The latter are particular to the College of Princes, and 
are formed out of 39 prelates, <fcc., and 93 Counts, c. The 
individual voices are common to the three Colleges, and are 
given by 9 Electors; 94 Princes, 33 of the ecclesiastical and 61 
of the secular Bench; and 50 Imperial Cities, 13 of the Rhenish, 
and 37 of the Suabian Bench. The King of Prussia has nine 
voices, in as many different capacities. Id. 
</p><p>
The three Colleges assemble in the same House, but in different apartments. Id. 
</p><p>
The Emperor, as head of the Germanic body, is President of 
the Diet. He and others are represented by proxies at present. Id. 
</p><p>
The deliberations are grounded on propositions from Emperor, and commence in the College of Electors, from whence they 
pass to that of the Princes, and thence to that of the Imperial 
Cities. They are not resolutions till they have been passed in 
each. "When the Electors and Princes cannot agree, they confer; but do not confer with the Imperial Cities. Plurality of 
voices decide in each College, except in matters of Religion and 
a few reserv. cases, in which, according to the Treaty of Westphalia and the Imperial Capitulations, the Empire is divided 
into the Catholic and Evangelic Corps. Id. 
</p><p>
After the Resolutions have passed the three Colleges they 
are presented to the Representative of the Emperor, without 
whose ratification they are null. Id. They are called placita 
after passing the three Colleges; conclusa, after ratification by 
Emperor. Id.

The collection of acts of one Diet is called the Recess, which 
cannot be made up and have the force of law till the close of 
the Diet. The subsisting diet has not been closed for more than 
a hundred years; of course it has furnished no effective Resolu-
tion, though a great number of interesting ones have passed. 
This delay proceeds from the Imperial Court, who refuse to 
grant a recess, notwithstanding the frequent and pressing applications made for one. Id. 
Federal Authority. 
</p><p>
The powers as well as the organization of the Diet have 
varied at different times. Antiently it elected as a corps the 
Emperors, and judged of their conduct. The Golden Bull gives 
this right to the Electors alone. Antiently it regulated tolls; 
at present the Electors alone do this. Id. 
</p><p>
The Treaty of Westphalia and the capitulations of the Emperors, from Charles V downwards, define the present powers 
of the Diet. These concern 1. Legislation of the Empire. 2. 
War and peace, and Alliances. 3. Raising troops. 4. Contributions. 5. Construction of fortresses. 6. Money. 7. Ban of 
the Empire. 8. Admission of new princes. 9. The Supreme 
tribunals. 10. Disposition of grand fiefs and grand charges. 
In all these points the Emperor and Diet must concur. Id. 
</p><p>
The Ban of the Empire is a sort of proscription, by which the 
disturbers of the public peace are punished. The offender's life 
and goods are at the mercy of every one; formerly, the Emperors themselves pronounced the ban against those who offended 
them. It has been since regulated that no one shall be exposed 
to the ban without the examination and consent of the Diet. 
Encyclop. 
</p><p>
By the Ban the party is outlawed, degraded from all his federal rights, his subjects absolved from their allegiance, and his 
possessions forfeited. Code de 1'Hum. 
</p><p>
The Ban is incurred when the Emperor or one of the supreme 
Tribunals address an order to any one, on pain, in case of disobedience, of being proscribed ipso facto. Id. 
</p><p>
The Circles, formerly, were in number six only. There are 
now ten. They were instituted for the more effectual preserv.ion of the public peace, and the execution of decrees of Diet 
and supreme Tribunals against contumacious members, for which 
purposes they have their particular diets, with the chief Prince 
of the circle at their head, have particular officers for commanding the forces of the Circle, levy contributions, see that justice 
is duly administered, that the coin is not debased, that the customs are not unduly raised. Savage, vol. 2, p. 35. 
</p><p>
If a circle fail to send its due succours, it is to pay damages 
suffered therefrom to its neighbours. If a member of the circle 
refuse, the Col. of the circle is to admonish; and if this be insufficient, the delinquent party is to be compelled under a sentence from the Imperial Chamber. Id. 
</p><p>
Imperial Chamber, established in 1495 by the Diet, as a means 
of public peace, by deciding controversies between members of 
the Empire. Code de 1'Hum. 
</p><p>
This is the first Tribunal of the Empire. It has an appellate 
jurisdiction in all Civil and fiscal causes, or where the public 
peace may be concerned. It has a concurrent jurisdiction with 
the Aulic Council, and causes cannot be removed from one to 
the other. Id. 
</p><p>
The Judges of this Tribunal are appointed partly by the Emperor, partly by Electors, partly by circles; are supported by 
all the States of the Empire, excepting the Emperor. They are 
badly paid, though great salaries are annexed to their offices. 
Id. 
</p><p>
In every action, real or personal, The Diet, Imperial Chamber, and Aulic Council, are so many supreme Courts, to which 
none of the States can demur. The jurisprudence by which 
they govern themselves are, according to the subject-matter: 
1. The provincial laws of Germany. 2. The Scripture. 3. 
The law of nature. 4. Law of Nations. 5. The Roman law. 
6. The canon law. 7. The fcedal law of the Lombards. Id.
