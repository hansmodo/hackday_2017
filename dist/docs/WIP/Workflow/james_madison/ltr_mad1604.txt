MY DEAR FRIEND, I view the amendments of Massachusetts 
pretty nearly in the same light that you do. They were meant 
for the people at large, not for the minority in the Convention. 
The latter were not affected by them, their objections being 
levelled against the very essence of the proposed Government. 
I do not see that the 2 d amendment, if I understand its scope, 
can be more exceptionable to the Southern States than the 
others. I take it to mean that the number of Representatives 
shall be limited to two hundred, who will be apportioned from 
time to time according to a census; not that the apportionment 
first made, when the Representatives amount to that number, 
shall be perpetual. The 9 th amendment, I have understood, was 
made a very serv.us point of by <a href='/results.php?tla=sam' rel='co-worker'>S. Adams</a>. 
</p><p>
I do not know of anything in the new Constitution that can 
change the obligations of the public with regard to the old 
money. The principle on which it is to be settled seems to be 
</p><p>

equally in the power of that as of the existing one. The claim 
of the Indiana Company cannot, I should suppose, be any more 
validated by the new system than that of all the creditors and 
others who have been aggrieved by unjust laws. You do not 
mention what part of the Constitution could give colour to such 
a doctrine. The condemnation of retrospective laws, if that be 
the part, does not appear to me to admit, on any principle, of 
such a retrospective construction. As to the religious test, I 
should conceive that it can imply at most nothing more than 
that, without that exception, a power would have been given to 
impose an oath, involving a religious test as a qualification for 
office. The constitution of necessary offices being given to the 
Congress, the proper qualifications seem to be evidently involved. I think, too, there are several other satisfactory points 
of view in which the exception might be placed. 
</p><p>
I shall be extremely happy to see a coalition among all the 
real federalists. Recommendatory alterations are the only 
ground that occurs to me. A conditional ratification or a 
second Convention appears to me utterly irreconcileable, in the 
present state of things, with the dictates of prudence and 
safety. I am confirmed by a comparative view of the publications on the subject, and still mo're of the debates in the several 
Conventions, that a second experiment would be either wholly 
abortive, or would end in something much more remote from 
your ideas, and those of others who wish a salutary Government, than the plan now before the public. It is to be considered, also, that besides the local and personal pride that would 
stand in the way, it could not be a very easy matter to bring 
about a reconsideration and rescision of what will certainly 
have been done in six, and probably eight States, and in several 
of them by unanimous votes. Add to all this the extreme 
facility with which those who secretly aim at disunion (and 
there are probably some such in most, if not all the States) will 
be able to carry on their schemes, under the mask of contending for alterations, popular in some places, and known to be 
inadmissible in others. Every danger of this sort might be 
justly dreaded from such men as this State and <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> only 
could furnish, playing for such a purpose into each others' 
hands. The declaration of Henry, mentioned in your letter, is 
a proof to me that desperate measures will be his game. If 
report does not more than usually exaggerate, Mason, also, is 
ripening fast for going every length. His licentiousness of 
animadversion, it is said, no longer spares even the moderate 
opponents of the Constitution.
