MY DEAR FRIEND, The President has been critically ill for 
some days past, but is now, we hope, out of danger; his complaint is a peripneumony, united probably with the Influenza. 
Since my last, I have found that I did not go too far in intimating that the cause of your delay would forbid the smallest criticism on it. I earnestly pray that you may no longer have occasion to plead that apology.

In consequence of a petition from New Hampshire, the subject 
of our commercial relation to Great Britain has been revived. 
A majority of the House of Representatives seem disposed to 
make a pretty bold experiment; and I think it will meet a very 
different reception in the Senate from the measure tried at the 
last session. If it fails, it will be owing to a dislike of the preference to Nations in Treaty.

The debt is not yet funded. The zealots for the assumption 
of the State debts keep back, in hopes of alarming the zealots 
for the federal debt. I understand that another effort is to be 
made for the assumption. Motives are 'felt, I suspect, which 
will account for the perseverance.
