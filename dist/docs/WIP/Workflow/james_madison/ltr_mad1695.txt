DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Beckley has just got back from his eastern trip. He says that the partizans of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>'s heresies in that quarter are 
perfectly insignificant in point of number; that particularly in <a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> he is become distinguished for his unpopularity; that 
Publicola is probably the manufacture of his son, out of materials furnished by himself, and that the publication is generally 
as obnoxious in New England as it appears to be in Pennsylvania. If young Adams be capable of giving the dress in which 
Publicola presents himself, it is very probable he may have been 
made the Editor of his father's doctrines. 
</p><p>
I hardly think the printer would so directly disavow the fact 
if <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> was himself the writer. There is more of method, 
also, in the arguments, and much less of clumsiness and heaviness in the style, than characterize his writings. 1 mentioned 
to you some time ago an extract from a piece in the Poughkeepsie paper as a sensible comment on <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>' doctrines. The 
whole has since been republished here, and is evidently from a 
better pen than any of the Anti-Publicolas I have seen. In 
Greenleaf's paper of to-day is a second letter from the same 
quarter, which confirms the character I have given of the Author. 
</p><p>
We understand here that 800 shares in the Bank, committed 
by this City to Mr. Constable, have been excluded by the manner in which the business was conducted; that a considerable 
number from <a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> met with the same fate, and that <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> 
has been kept out in toto. It is all charged on the manoeuvres 
of <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, which is said to have secured a majority of the 
whole to herself. The disappointed individuals are clamorous 
of course, and the language of the place marks a general indignation on the subject. If it should turn out that the cards were 
packed for the purpose of securing the game to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, 
or even that more than half the Institution, and of course the 
whole direction of it, have fallen into the hands of that city, 
some who have been loudest in their plaudits whilst they expected to share in the plunder will be equally so in sounding 
the injustice of monopoly, and the danger of undue influence on 
the Government. 
</p><p>
The packet is not yet arrived. By a vessel arrived yesterday, newspapers are received from <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> which are said to be 
later than any yet come to hand. I do not find that any particular facts of moment are handed out. The miscellaneous 
articles come to me thro' Childs' paper, which you get sooner 
than I could rehearse to you. It has been said here by the 
Anglicans that the President's message to Congress on the subject of the commercial disposition of Great Britain has been 
asserv.d openly by Mr. Pitt to be .misrepresentation; and as it 
would naturally be traced to <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='co-worker'>Gouverneur Morris</a>, it has been 
suggested that he fell into the hands of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier Luzerne</a>, 
who had the dexterity to play off his negotiations for French 
purposes. I have reason to believe that Beckwith has had a 
hand in throwing these things into circulation. I wish you success with all my heart in your efforts for Paine. Besides the 
advantage to him, which he deserv., an appointment for him 
at this moment would do public good in various ways. 
Always and truly yours.
