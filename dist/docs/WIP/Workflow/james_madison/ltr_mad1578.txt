DEAR SIR, My last was intended for the August packet, and 
put into the hands of Commodore Paul Jones. Some disappointments prevented his going, and as he did not know but its 
contents might be unfit for the ordinary conveyance, he retained 
it. The precaution was unnecessary. For the same reason the 
delay has been of little consequence. The rule of secrecy in the 
Convention rendered that, as it will this letter, barren of those 
communications which might otherwise be made. As the Convention will shortly rise, I should feel little scruple in disclosing what will be public here before it could reach you, were it 
practicable for me to guard by cypher against an intermediate 
discovery. But I am deprived of this resource by the shortness 
of the interval between the receipt of your letter of June 20 and 
the date of this. This is the first day which has been free from 
Committee serv.e, both before and after the hours of the House, 
and the last that is allowed me by the time advertised for the 
sailing of the packet. 
</p><p>
The Convention consists now, as it has generally done, of 
eleven States. There has been no intermission of its session 
since a house was formed, except an interval of about ten days 
allowed a committee appointed to detail the general propositions agreed on in the House. The term of its dissolution cannot be more than one or two weeks distant. A Government 
will probably be submitted to the people of the States, consisting of a President, cloathed with Executive power; a Senate 
chosen by the Legislatures, and another House chosen by the 
people of the States, jointly possessing the Legislative power; 
and a regular Judiciary establishment. The mode of constituting 
the Executive is among the few points not yet finally settled. 
The Senate will consist of two members from each State, and 
appointed sexennially. The other House, of members appointed 
biennially by the people of the States, in proportion to their 
number. The Legislative power will extend to taxation, trade, 
and sundry other general matters. The powers of Congress 
will be distributed, according to their nature, among the several 
departments. The States will be restricted from paper money, 
and in a few other instances. These are the outlines. The extent of them may, perhaps, surprize you. I hazard an opinion, 
nevertheless, that the plan, should it be adopted, will neither 
effectually answer its national object, nor prevent the local mischiefs which everywhere excite disgusts against the State Governments. The grounds of this opinion will be the subject of a 
future letter.

I have written to a friend in Congress, intimating, in a covert 
manner, the necessity of deciding and notifying the intentions 
of Congress with regard to their foreign Ministers after May 
next, and have dropped a hint on the communications of Dumas. 
</p><p>
Congress have taken some measures for disposing of the public land, and have actually sold a considerable tract. Another 
bargain, I learn, is on foot for a further sale. 
</p><p>
Nothing can exceed the universal anxiety for the event of the 
meeting here. Reports and conjectures abound concerning the 
nature of the plan which is to be proposed. The public, however, is certainly in the dark with regard to it. The Convention is equally in the dark as to the reception which may be 
given to it on its publication. All the prepossessions are on 
the right side, but it may well be expected that certain characters will wage war against any reform whatever. My own 
idea is, that the public mind will now, or in a very little time, 
receive anything that promises stability to the public Councils 
and security to private rights, and that no regard ought to be 
had to local prejudices or temporary considerations. If the 
present moment be lost, it is hard to say what may be our fate.

Our information from Virginia is far from being agreeable. 
In many parts of the Country the drought has been extremely 
injurious to the Corn. I fear, tho' I have no certain information, that <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> and Albemarle share in the distress. The 
people, also, are said to be generally discontented. A paper 
emission is again a topic among them; so is an instalment of all 
debts, in some places, and the making property a tender in 
others. The taxes are another source of discontent. The 
weight of them is complained of, and the abuses in collecting 
them still more so. In several Counties the prisons, and Court 
Houses, and Clerks' offices, have been wilfully burnt. In Green 
Briar, the course of Justice has been mutinously stopped, and 
associations entered into against the payment of taxes. No 
other County has yet followed the example. The approaching 
meeting of the Assembly will probably allay the discontents on 
one side by measures which will excite them on another.

Mr. Wythe has never returned to us. His lady, whose illness carried him away, died some time after he got home. The 
other deaths in Virginia are Col. A. Gary, and a few days ago, 
Mrs. Harrison, wife of Benjamin Harrison, Jun r , and sister of 
J. F. Mercer. 
</p><p>
Wishing you all happiness, I remain, dear sir, yours affectionately.

Give my best wishes to Mazzei. I have received his letter 
and book, and will write by the next packet to him. Dorman 
is still in Virginia. Congress have done nothing for him in his 
affair. I am not sure that 9 States have been assembled of late. 
At present, it is doubtful whether there are seven.
