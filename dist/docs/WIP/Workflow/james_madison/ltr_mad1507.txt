DEAR SIR, On Saturday last a proposition was agreed to 
for establishing Circuit Courts throughout this Commonwealth, 
and yesterday a bill for that purpose was reported. On Wednesday next it will undergo a discussion of the Committee of 
the whole. The circumstances under which it has passed thus 
far seem to promise a favorable issue, but the dangers which it 
is yet to go through are formidable. They proceed from latent 
and interested objections, which have on several former occasions proved fatal to similar attempts. The plan is pretty 
analogous to the Nisi prius established in England. 
</p><p>
On Tuesday, sundry propositions were made by Mr. Jones 
in favor of the 4th Article of the Treaty of peace. They passed 
by a large majority, with blanks as to the length of time to be 
given for the payment of the principal, and for disallowing the 
interest. The former was filled up with seven years, in preference to 10, 8, 6, and 5, which were contended for on different 
sides. The latter, with the period between April 19th, <a href="/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>, 
and March 3d, <a href="/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>, in preference to the period between the 
first date and May, <a href="/results.php?year=1784">1784</a>, the date of the exchange of ratifications. The bill will probably pass, but not, I fear, without some 
improper ingredients, and particularly some conditions relative 
to the North Western posts, or the Negroes, which lye without 
our province. 
</p><p>
The bill for the Religious Assessment was reported yesterday, 
and will be taken up in a Committee of the whole next week. 
Its friends are much disheartened at the loss of <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>. 
Its fate is, I think, very uncertain. Another Act of the House 
of Delegates during the present week is a direction to the Executive to carry into effect the vote of a Bust to [of?] the <a href="/results.php?tla=laf" rel="acquaintance friend colleague met">Marquis 
de Lafayette</a>, to be presented to the City of <a href="/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, and to cause 
another to be procured to be set up in this Country. These 
resolutions are so contrived as to hide as much as possible the 
circumstance in the original vote of the bust being to be presented to the Marquis himself. I find by a letter from General 
"Washington that he was on the 28 ult. just setting out to 
accompany the <a href="/results.php?tla=laf" rel="friend colleague met">Marquis</a> to <a href="/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>, and thence to <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. 
The latter may therefore soon be expected at Trenton. He 
has been much caressed here, as well as everywhere else on his 
Tour, and I make no doubt he will leave Congress with equal 
reason to be pleased with his visit. I meant to have sent you 
a copy of the Resolutions touching the Busts, but have been 
disappointed in getting one. They were offered by Mr. Jones, and agreed to unanimously, as they no doubt will also be in the Senate. 
Wishing you all happiness, I am, dear sir, your's sincerely.
