<a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">NEW YORK</a>, November 18, <a href="/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your favour of the 5th instant found me in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, whither I had proceeded, under arrangements for proceeding to Virginia or returning to this place, as I might there 
decide. I did not acknowledge it in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, because I had nothing to communicate which you would not receive more 
fully and correctly from the Mr. Morrises, who were setting out for Virginia. 
</p><p>
All my informations from <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> concur in representing 
the enthusiasm in favor of the new Constitution as subsiding, 
and giving place to a spirit of criticism. I was fearful of such 
an event from the influence and co-operation of some of the adversaries. I do not learn, however, that the cause has lost its 
majority in the Legislature, and still less among the people at 
large. 
</p><p>
I have nothing to add to the information heretofore given 
concerning the progress of the Constitution in other States. 
Mr. Gerry has presented his objections to the Legislature in a 
letter addressed to them, and signified his readiness, if desired, 
to give the particular reasons on which they were founded. 
The Legislature, it seems, decline the explanation, either from 
a supposition that they have nothing further to do in the business, having handed it over to the Convention, or from an unwillingness to countenance Mr. Gerry's conduct, or from both 
of these considerations. It is supposed that the promulgation 
of this letter will shake the confidence of some, and embolden 
the opposition of others in that State; but I cannot discover 
any ground for distrusting the prompt and decided concurrence 
of a large majority. 
</p><p>
I enclose herewith the seven first numbers of the Federalist, 
a paper addressed to the people of this State. They relate entirely to the importance of the Union. If the whole plan should 
be executed, it will present to the public a full discussion of the 
merits of the proposed Constitution in all its relations. From 
the opinion I have formed of the views of a party in Virginia, 
I am inclined to think that the observ.ions on the first branch 
of the subject may not be superfluous antidotes in that State, 
any more than in this. If you concur with me, perhaps the 
papers may be put into the hands of some of your confidential 
correspondents at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, who would have them reprinted 
there. I will not conceal from you that I am likely to have 
such a degree of connection with the publication here as to afford a restraint of delicacy from interesting myself directly in 
the republication elsewhere. You will recognize one of the 
pens concerned in the task. There are three in the whole. A 
fourth may possibly bear a part. 
</p><p>
The intelligence by the packet, as far as I have collected it, 
is contained in the Gazette of yesterday. 
</p><p>
Virginia is the only State represented, as yet. When a Congress will be formed is altogether uncertain. It is not very 
improbable, I think, that the interregnum may continue throughout the winter. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment, &c. 
</p>
