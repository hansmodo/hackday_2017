DEAR SIR, My last enclosed the seven first numbers of the 
paper of which I gave you some account. I now add the seven 
following numbers, which close the first branch of the subject 
the importance of the Union. The succeeding papers shall be 
forwarded from time to time as they come out.

The latest authentic information from Europe places the 
Dutch in a wretched situation. The patriots will probably depend, in the event, on external politics for the degree of security and power that may be left them. The Turks and Russians 
have begun a war in that quarter, and a general one is not improbable. 
</p><p>
I have heard nothing of consequence lately concerning the 
progress of the new Constitution. The Pennsylvania Convention has probably by this time come to a decision, but it is not 
known here. 
</p><p>
Not more than two or three States are yet convened. The 
prospect of a quorum during the winter continues precarious. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of respect and attachment, I remain, 
Dear Sir, your affect", humble serv.
