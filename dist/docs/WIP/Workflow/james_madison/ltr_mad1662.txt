DEAR SIR, I was favored on Saturday with yours of the 2d 
instant. The Judiciary is now under consideration. I view it 
as you do, as defective both in its general structure, and many 
of its particular regulations. The attachment of the Eastern 
members, the difficulty of substituting another plan with the 
consent of those who agree in disliking the bill, the defect of 
time, c., will, however, prevent any radical alterations. The 
most I hope is that some offensive violations of Southern jurisprudence may be corrected, and that the system may speedily 
undergo a reconsideration under the auspices of the Judges, who 
alone will be able, perhaps, to set it to rights.

The Senate have sent back the plan of amendments with some 
alterations, which strike, in my opinion, at the most salutary 
articles. In many of the States, juries, even in criminal cases, 
are taken from the State at large; in others, from districts of 
considerable extent; in very few from the County alone. Hence 
a dislike to the restraint with respect to vicinage, which has produced a negative on that clause. A fear of inconvenience from 
a Constitutional bar to appeals below a certain value, and a 
confidence that such a limitation is not necessary, have had the 
same effect on the article. Several others have had a similar 
fate. The difficulty of uniting the minds of men accustomed to 
think and act differently can only be conceived by those who 
have witnessed it. <

A very important question is depending on the subject of a 
permanent seat for the federal Government. Early in the Session secret negoeiations were set on foot among the Northern 
States, from Pennsylvania, inclusively. The parties finally disagreeing in their arrangements, both made advances to the 
Southern members. On the side of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and New England, we were led to expect the Susquehannah within a reasonable time if we would sit still in <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, otherwise we were 
threatened with Trenton. These terms were inadmissible to 
the friends of Potowmac. On the side of Pennsylvania, who 
was full of distrust and animosity against New England and 
<a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, the Potowmac was presented as the reward for the 
temporary advantages if given by the Southern States. Some 
progress was made on this ground, and the prospect became 
flattering, when a reunion was produced among the original 
parties by circumstances which it would be tedious to explain. 
The Susquehannah has in consequence been voted. The bill is 
not yet brought in, and many things may yet happen. We shall 
parry any decision if we can, though I see little hope of attaining our own object, the Eastern States being inflexibly opposed 
to the Potowmac, and for some reasons which are more likely 
to grow stronger than weaker; and if we are to be placed on 
the Susquehannah, the sooner the better.
