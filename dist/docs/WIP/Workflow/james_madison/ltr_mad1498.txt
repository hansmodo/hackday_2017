</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 1st July, written on the eve 
of your embarcation from <a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, was safely delivered by your 
serv.t Bob about the 20th of the same month. Along with it. 
I received the pamphlet on the West India trade, and a copy of 
Deane's

My last was written from <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> on the adjournment of 
the General Assembly, and put into the hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Short</a>. It 
contained a cursory view of legislative proceedings, referring 
to the bearer for a more circumstantial one. Since the adjournment, I have been so little abroad that I ani unable to say with 
certainty how far those proceedings harmonize with the vox 
populi. The opinion of some who have better means of information is, that a large majority of the people, either from a 
sense of private justice or of national faith, dislike the footing 
on which British debts are placed. . The proceedings relative 
to an amendment of the State Constitution seem to interest the 
public much less than a friend to the scheme would wish. 
</p><p>
The act which produces most agitation and discussion is that 
which restrains foreign trade to enumerated ports. Those who 
meditate a revival of it on the old plan of British monopoly 
and diffusive credit, or whose mercantile arrangements might 
be disturbed by the innovation, with those whose local situations give them, or are thought to give them, an advantage in 
large vessels coming up the rivers to their usual stations, are 
busy in decoying the people into a belief that trade ought in 
all cases to be left to regulate itself; that to confine it to particular ports is to renounce the boon with which nature has 
favoured our country; and that if one set of men are to be importers and exporters, another set to be carryers between the 
mouths and heads of the rivers, and a third retailers, trade, as 
it must pass through so many hands, all taking a profit, must 
in the end come dearer to the people than if the simple plan 
should be continued which unites these several branches in the 
same hands. 
</p><p>
These and other objections, tho' unsound, are not altogether 
unplausible, and being propagated with more zeal and pains by 
those who have a particular interest to serv.than proper answers are by those who regard the general interest only, make 
it very possible that the measure may be rescinded before it is 
to take effect. Should it escape such a fate, it will be owing 
to a few striking and undeniable facts, namely, that goods are 
much dearer in Virginia than in the States where trade is drawn 
to a general mart; that even goods brought from <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
and <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> to Winchester, and other Western and South 
Western parts of Virginia, are retailed cheaper than those imported directly from Europe are sold on tide water; that generous as the present price of our Tobacco appears, the same 
article has currently sold 15 or 20 per cent, at least higher in 
<a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, where, being as far from the ultimate market, it 
cannot be intrinsically worth more; that scarce a single vessel 
from any part of Europe, other than the British Dominions, 
comes into our ports, whilst vessels from so many other parts 
of Europe resort to other ports of America, almost all of them, 
too, in pursuit of the staple of Virginia. 
</p><p>
The exemption of our own citizens from the restrictions is 
another circumstance that helps to parry attacks on the policy 
of it. The warmest friends to the law were averse to this discrimination, which not only departs from its principle, but gives 
it an illiberal aspect to foreigners; but it was a necessary concession to prevailing sentiments. The like discrimination between our own citizens and those of other States, contrary to 
the federal articles, is an erratum which was omitted to be rectified, but will no doubt be so. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the languor of our direct trade with Europe, 
this country has indirectly tasted some of the fruits of Independence. The price of our last crop of Tobacco has been, on 
James River, from 36s. to 42s. 6c?. pr cwt., and has brought more 
specie into the country than it ever before contained at one 
time. The price of Hemp, however, has been reduced as much 
by the peace as that of Tobacco has been raised, being sold, I 
am told, as low as 20s. per cwt. beyond the Mountains. Our 
crops of wheat have been rather scanty, owing partly to the 
rigors of the Winter, partly to an insect, which in many places 
has destroyed whole fields of that grain. The same insect has, 
since the harvest, fallen upon the Corn with considerable damage; but without some very unusual disaster to that article the 
crop will be exuberant, and will afford plentiful supplies for 
the W. India Islands, if their European Masters will no longer 
deny themselves the benefit of such a trade with us. The crop 
of the Tobacco now on the ground will, if the weather continues 
favorable, be tolerably good, though much shortened on the 
whole by the want of early seasons for transplanting, and an 
uncommon number of the insects which prey upon it in its different stages. It will be politic, I think, for the people here to 
push the culture of this article whilst the price keeps up, it becoming more apparent every day that the richness of soil and 
fitness of climate on the Western waters will, in a few years, 
both reduce the price and engross the culture of it. This event 
begins to be generally foreseen, and increases the demand 
greatly for land on the Ohio. What think you of a guinea an 
acre being already the price for choice tracts, with sure titles? 
 
Nothing can delay such a revolution with regard to our staple 
but an impolitic and perverse attempt in Spain to shut the 
mouth of the Mississippi against the inhabitants above. I say 
delay, because she can no more finally stop the current of trade 
down the river than she can that of the river itself. The importance of this matter is in almost every mouth. I am frequently asked what progress has been made towards a treaty 
with Spain, and what may be expected from her liberality on 
this point, the querists all counting on an early ability in the 
western settlements to apply to other motives, if necessary. 
My answers have, both from ignorance and prudence, been evasive. I have not thought fit, however, to cherish unfavorable 
impressions, being more and more led by revolving the subject 
to conclude that Spain will never be so mad as to persist in her 
present ideas. For want of better matter for correspondence, 
I will state the grounds on which I build my expectations. 
</p><p>
First. Apt as the policy of nations is to disregard justice and 
the general rights of mankind, I deem it no small advantage 
that these considerations are in our favour. They must be felt 
in some degree by the most corrupt councils on a question 
whether the interest of millions shall be sacrificed to views concerning a distant and paltry settlement; they are every day 
acquiring weight from, the progress of philosophy and civilization, and they must operate on those nations of Europe who 
have given us a title to their friendly offices, or who may wish 
to gain a title to ours. 
</p><p>
Secondly. May not something be hoped from the respect which 
Spain may feel for consistency of character on an appeal to the 
doctrine maintained by herself in the year 1609, touching the 
Scheld, or at least from the use which may be made of that fact 
by the powers disposed to favor our views ? 
</p><p>
Thirdly. The interest of Spain at least ought to claim her 
attention. 1. A free trade down the Mississippi would make 
New Orleans one of the most flourishing emporiums in the 
world, and deriving its happiness from the benevolence of 
Spain, it would feel a firm loyalty to her government. At present 
it is an expensive establishment, settled chiefly by French, who 
hate the government which oppresses them, who already covet 
a trade with the upper country, will become every day more 
sensible of the rigor which denies it to them, and will join in 
any attempt which may be made against their masters. 2d. A 
generous policy on the part of Spain towards the United States 
will be the cement of friendship and lasting peace with them. 
A contrary one will produce immediate heart burnings, and sow 
the seeds of inevitable hostility. The United States are already 
a power not to be despised by Spain; the time cannot be distant 
when, in spite of all precautions, the safety of her possessions 
in this quarter of the Globe must depend more on our peaceableness than her own power. 3. In another view, it is against 
the interest of Spain to throw obstacles in the way of our Western settlements. The part she took during the late war shews 
that she apprehended less from the power growing up in her 
neighborhood in a state of independence than as an instrument 
in the hands of Great Britain. If in this she calculated on the 
impotence of the United States, when dismembered from the 
British empire, she saw but little way into futurity; if on the 
pacific temper of republics, unjust irritations on her part will 
soon prove to her that these have like passions with other governments. Her permanent security seems to lie in the complexity 
of our federal government, and the diversity of interests among 
the members of it, which render offensive measures improbable 
in council and difficult in execution. If such be the case, when 
thirteen States compose the system, ought she not to wish to 
see the number enlarged to three and twenty ? A source of 
temporary security to her is our want of naval strength: ought 
she no!" then, to favor those emigrations to the Western land 
which, as long as they continue, will leave no supernumerary 
hands for the sea ? 
</p><p>
Fourthly. Should none of these circumstances affect her 
councils, she cannot surely so far disregard the usage of nations 
as to contend that her possessions at the mouth of the Mississippi justify a total denial of the use of it to the inhabitants 
above, when possessions much less disproportionate at the mouth 
of other rivers have been admitted only as a title to a moderate 
toll. The case of the Rhine, the Maese, and the Scheld, as well 
as the Elbe and Oder, are, if I mistake not, in point here. How 
far other Rivers may afford parallel cases, I cannot say. That 
of the Mississippi is probably the strongest in the world. 
</p><p>
Fifthly. Must not the general interest of Europe in all cases 
influence the determinations of any particular nation in Europe, 
and does not that interest in the present case clearly lie on our 
side? 1. All the principal powers have, in a general view, 
more to gain than to lose by denying a right of those who hold 
the mouths of rivers to intercept a communication with them 
above. France, Great Britain, and Sweden, have no opportunity of exerting such a right, and must wish a free passage for 
their merchandize in every country. Spain herself has no such 
opportunity, and has, besides, three of her principal rivers, one 
of them the seat of her metropolis, running through Portugal. 
Russia can have nothing to lose by denying this pretension, and 
is bound to do so in favor of her great rivers, the Neiper, the 
Niester, and the Don, which mouth in the Black sea, and of the 
passage thro' the Dardanelles, which she extorted from the 
Turks. The Emperor, in common with the inland States of 
Germany, and, moreover, by his possessions on the Maese and 
the Scheld, has a similar interest. The possessions of the King 
of Prussia on the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Oder, are pledges 
for his orthodoxy. 
</p><p>
The United Provinces hold, it is true, the mouths of the 
Maese, the Rhine, and the Scheld, but a general freedom of 
trade is so much their policy, and they now carry on so much 
of it through the channel of rivers flowing thro' different dominions, that their weight can hardly be thrown into the wrong 
scale. The only powers that can have an interest in opposing 
the American doctrine are the Ottoman, which has already 
given up the point to Russia; Denmark, which is suffered to retain the entrance of the Baltic; Portugal, whose principal rivers 
head in Spain; Venice, which holds the mouth of the Po; and 
Dantzick, which commands that of the Vistula, if it is yet to be 
considered as a sovereign City. The prevailing disposition of 
Europe on this point once frustrated an attempt of Deninark 
to exact a toll at the mouth of the Elbe by means of a fort on 
the Holstein side, which commands it. The fact is mentioned 
in Salmon's Gazetteer, under the head of Cluestadt. I have no 
opportunity of ascertaining the circumstances of the case, or of 
discovering like cases. 
</p><p>
2. In a more important view, the settlement of the Western 
country, which will much depend on the free use of the Mississippi, will be beneficial to all nations who either directly or indirectly trade with the United States. By a free expansion of 
our people the establishment of internal manufactures will not 
only be long delayed, but the consumption of foreign manufactures long continue increasing; and at the same time, all the 
productions of the American soil, required by Europe in return 
for her manufactures, will proportionably increase. The vacant 
land of the United States lying on the waters of the Mississippi 
is, perhaps, equal in extent to the land actually settled. If no 
check be given to the emigrations from the latter to the former, 
they will probably keep pace at least with the increase of our 
people, till the population of both becomes nearly equal. For 
twenty or twenty-five years we shall consequently have as few 
internal manufactures in proportion to our numbers as at present, and at the end of that period our imported manufactures 
will be doubled. It may be observ., too, that as the market 
for their manufactures will first increase, and the provision for 
supplying it will follow, the price of supplies will naturally rise 
in favor of those who manufacture them. On the other hand, 
as the demand for the tobacco, indigo, rice, corn, &c., produced 
by America for exportation, will neither precede nor keep pace 
with their increase, the price must naturally sink in favor also 
of those who consume them. 
</p><p>
Reverse the case by supposing the use of the Mississippi denied to us, and the consequence is, that many of our supernumerary hands who, in the former case, would be husbandmen on 
the waters of the Mississippi, will, on the latter supposition, be 
manufacturers on those of the Atlantic, and even those who may 
not be discouraged from seating the vacant lands will be obliged, 
by the want of vent for the produce of the soil, and of the means 
of purchasing foreign manufactures, to manufacture in a great 
measure for themselves. 
</p><p>
Should Spain yield the point of the navigation of the Mississippi, but at the same time refuse us the use of her shores, the 
benefit will be ideal only. I have conversed with several persons who have a practical knowledge of the subject, all of whom 
assure me that not only the right of fastening to the Spanish 
shore, but that of holding an entrepot in our own, or of using 
New Orleans as a free port, is essential to a free trade through 
that channel. It has been said that sea vessels can get up as 
high as latitude thirty-two to meet the river craft, but it will 
be with so much difficulty and disadvantage as to amount to a 
prohibition. 
</p><p>
The idea has also been suggested of large magazines constructed for floating; but if this expedient were otherwise admissible, the hurricanes, which in that quarter frequently demolish edifices on land, forbid the least confidence in those 
which would have no foundation but water. Some territorial 
privileges, therefore, seem to be as indispensable to the use of 
the river as this is to the prosperity of the western country. 
</p><p>
A place called " The Englishman's turn," on the island of 
about six leagues below the town of New Orleans, is, I am told, 
the fittest for our purpose, and that the lower side of the peninsula is the best. Batonrouge is also mentioned as a convenient station; and Point Coupb as the highest to which vessels 
can ascend with tolerable ease. Information, however, of this, 
from men who judge from a general and superficial view only, 
can never be received as accurate. If Spain be sincerely disposed to gratify us, I hope she will be sensible it cannot be 
done effectually without allowing a previous survey and deliberate choice. 
</p><p>
Should it be impossible to obtain from her a portion of ground 
by other means, would it be unadvisable to attempt it by purchase ? The price demanded could not well exceed the benefit 
to be obtained, and a reimbursement of the public advance 
might easily be provided for by the sale to individuals, and the 
conditions which might be annexed to their tenures. Such a 
spot could not fail, in a little time, to equal in value the same 
extent in <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> or Amsterdam. 
</p><p>
The most intelligent of those with whom I have conversed 
think that, on whatever footing our trade may be allowed, very 
judicious provision will be necessary for a fair adjustment of 
disputes between the Spaniards and the Americans disputes 
which must be not only noxious to trade, but tend to embroil 
the two nations. Perhaps a joint tribunal, under some modification or other, might answer the purpose. There is a precedent, 
I see, for such an establishment, in the twenty-first article of the 
treaty of Munster, in 1648, between Spain and the United Netherlands. 
</p><p>
I am informed that, sometime after New Orleans passed into 
the hands of Spain, her Governor forbid all British vessels navigating under the treaty of <a href="/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> to fasten to the shore, and 
caused such as did so to be cut loose. In consequence of this 
practice a British frigate went up near the Town, fastened to 
the shore, and set out guards to fire on any who might attempt 
to cut her loose. The Governor, after trying in vain to remove 
the frigate by menaces, acquiesced, after which British vessels 
indiscriminately used the shore; and even the residence of British 
Merchants in the town of New Orleans, trading clandestinely 
with the Spaniards, as well as openly with their own people, was 
winked at. The Treaty of 1763 stipulated to British subjects, 
as well as I recollect, no more than the right of navigating the 
river; and if that of using was admitted under that stipulation, 
the latter right must have been admitted to be included in the former. 
</p><p>
In consequence of my letter to Mrs. Carr, I have been called 
on by your elder nephew, who is well satisfied with the choice 
made of <a href="/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a> for his future studies. I have furnished 
him withto my acquaintance there, and with a draught 
on your steward for 12. He will be down by the opening of 
Mr. Maury's school at the close of the vacation, which lasts 
from the beginning of August to the end of September. I have 
the greater hopes that the preference of this school will turn 
out a proper one as it has received the approbation of the literary gentlemen of <a href="/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a>, and will be periodically examined by Mr. Wythe and others. Your younger nephew is 
with Major Callis, who will keep school some time longer. I 
am at a loss as yet where to fix him, but will guard as much as 
possible against any idle interval. 
</p><p>
I am, very affect 6 ' 7 , dear Sir, your friend and serv.
