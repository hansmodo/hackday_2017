</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 13th came safe yesterday. 
The past week has brought forth very little of consequence, 
except the disagreeable and, I fear, certain information of the 
arrival of the Cape fleet. Our last account of the embarkation 
at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> was that the ships had fallen down to the Hook, 
that the number of troops was quite unknown, as well as their 
destination, except that in general it was southwardly. It is 
still said that Philips is to command this detachment. If the 
projected junction between Leslie and Cornwallis had not been 
so opportunely frustrated by the gallant volunteers at King's 
Mountain, it is probable that Philips would have reinforced the 
former, as the great force in his rear would otherwise have 
rendered every advance hazardous. 
</p><p>
At present, it seems more likely that the declining state of 
their Southern affairs will call their attention to that quarter. 
They can, it is well known, regain at any time their present 
footing in Virginia, if it should be thought expedient to abandon it, or to collect in their forces to a defensible point; but 
every retrograde step they take towards Charlestown proves 
fatal to their general plan. Mr. J. Adams, in a letter of the 
23d of August, from Amsterdam, received yesterday, says that 
General Prevost had sailed from England with a few frigates 
for Cape Fear, in order to facilitate the operations of their arms 
in North Carolina, and that the Ministry were determined to 
make the Southern States the scene of a very active winter 
campaign. No intimation is given by <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> of the number of troops under General Prevost. The second division of 
the French fleet mentioned in my last to have been off Bermudas has not yet made its appearance. It is now either [?] 
supposed to have been a British one. 
</p><p>
The death of General Woodford is announced in a New 
York paper of the 17th. I have not seen the paper, but am 
told that no particulars are mentioned. I suppose it will reach 
his friends before this will be received, through some other 
channel. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
