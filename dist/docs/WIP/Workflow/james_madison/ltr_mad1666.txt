DEAR SIR, After being detained 8 or ten days beyond the 
intended commencement of my journey by the critical illness 
of my mother, I am now subjected to a further delay by an 
attack on my own health, and shall be under the 
necessity not only of remaining here a few days longer, but of 
travelling afterwards with some circumspection.

You will probably have seen by the papers that the contest 
in the Assembly on the subject of the amendments ended in the 
loss of them. The House of Delegates got over the objections 
to the llth and 12th, but the Senate revised them with an 
addition of the 3d and 8th Articles, and by a vote of adherence 
prevented a ratification. On some accounts this event is no 
doubt to be regretted, but it will do no injury to the GEN'L Gov c . 
On the contrary, it will have the effect with many of turning 
their distrust towards their own Legislature. The miscarriage 
of the 3d Article, particularly, will have this effect. 
</p><p>
A few days before I was allowed to set out for <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I 
took a ride to Monticello. The answer of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a> to the 
notification of his appointment will no doubt have explained 
the state of his mind on that subject. I was sorry to find him 
so little biassed in favor of the domestic serv.e allotted to 
him, but was glad that his difficulties seemed to result chiefly 
from what I take to be an erroneous view of the kind and 
quantity of business annexed to that which constitutes the 
foreign Department. He apprehends that it -will far exceed 
the latter, which has, of itself, no terrors to him. On the 
other, it was supposed, and I believe truly, that the Domestic 
part will be very trifling, and for that reason improper to be 
made a distinct Department. After all, if the whole business 
can be executed by any one man, <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a> must be equal 
to it; if not, he will be relieved by a necessary division of it. 
All whom I have heard speak on the subject are remarkably 
solicitous for his acceptance, and I flatter myself that they will 
not, in the final event, be disappointed. 
</p><p>
In case I should be detained here much longer than I calculate, and anything should occur, I may trouble you with a few 
lines further.
