DEAR SIR, The season of harvest having suspended all intercourse with <a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, your favor of the 7th instant 
has but just been received. That of the 29th ult. came to hand 
at the same time. The preceding one of the 23d would have 
been acknowledged before, but for the cause above mentioned. 
The present is the first opportunity, and, like several others, 
leaves me but a moment to prepare for it. 
</p><p>
I have read over the subject which you recommend to my 
attention. It excites equally surprise and indignation, and ought 
certainly to be taken notice of by some one who can do it justice. In my present disposition, which is perfectly alienated 
from such things, and in my present situation, which deprives 
me of some material facts and many important lights, the task 
would be in bad hands if I were otherwise better qualified for 
it. I am in hopes of finding that some one else has undertaken 
it. In the mean time, I will feel my own pulse, and if nothing 
uprears, may possibly try to supply the omission. 
</p><p>
Return my thanks to Dr. Logan for the pamphlet, and also 
for the ploughs arrived at Fredericksburg, though, by a singular 
succession of errors and accidents, they are still on the road 
between this and that. Your account of Genet is dreadful. He 
must be brought right, if possible. His folly will otherwise do 
mischief which no wisdom can repair. Is there no one through 
whom he can be effectually counselled? De la Forest is said 
to be able, and if himself rightly disposed, as I have understood 
him to be, might, perhaps, be of great use. The result of the 
Harvest is perhaps less favorable than I once supposed. I hope, 
however, the crop of wheat, as to quantity at least, will be tolerable. Of the quality, I have great apprehensions. The season for getting it in was as bad as was possible. Every other 
article of our cultivation is prosperous, and will help to make 
amends if the rest of the year be favorable. The corn is particularly luxuriant in all quarters.

Yours always and affec
