DEAR SIR, We proceed slowly in business. The Report of <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Mr. Hamilton</a> has been, of late, the principal subject of debate. 
On the foreign debt the vote has been unanimous. On the domestic, a reduction of the transferred principal has been brought 
into view by several arguments and propositions. My idea is 
that there should be no interference of the public in favour of 
the public either as to principal or interest, but that the highest market price only should be allowed to the purchaserv. and 
the balance be applied to solace the original sufferers, whose 
claims were not in conscience extinguished by a, forced payment 
in depreciated certificates. The equity of this proposition is not 
contested. Its impracticability will be urged as an insuperable 
objection. I am aware of the difficulties of the plan, but believe 
they might be removed by one-half the exertion that will be 
used to collect and colour them.

A Bill for taking a census has passed the House of Representatives, and is with the Senate. It contained a schedule for 
ascertaining the component classes of the Society, a kind of information extremely requisite to the Legislator, and much 
wanted for the science of Political Economy. A repetition of 
it every ten years would hereafter afford a most curious and 
instructive assemblage of facts. It was thrown out by the Senate as a waste of trouble and supplying materials for idle people 
to make a book. Judge by this little experiment of the reception likely to be given to so great an idea as that explained in 
your letter of September.
