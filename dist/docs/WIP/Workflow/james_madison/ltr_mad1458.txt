TO MR. WILLIAM BRADFORD, JR. 
</p><p>
VIRGINIA, <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> COUNTY, April 1, <a href="/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
MY WORTHY FRIEND, I have another favor to acknowledge 
in the receipt of your kind letter of March the 4th. I did not 
intend to have written again to you before I obtained a nearer 
communication with you; but you have too much interest in my 
inclinations ever to be denied a request. 
</p><p>
Mr. Brackenridge's illness gives me great uneasiness; I think 
he would be a loss to America. His merit is rated so high by 
me that I confess, if he were gone, I could almost say with the 
poet, that his country could furnish such a pomp for death no 
more. But I solace myself from Finley's ludicrous descriptions 
as you do. 
</p><p>
Our Assembly is to meet the first of May, when it is expected 
something will be done in behalf of the dissenters. Petitions, 
I hear, are already forming among the persecuted Baptists, and 
I fancy it is in the thoughts of the Presbyterians also, to intercede or greater liberty in matters of religion. For my own 
part, I cannot help being very doubtful of their succeeding in the 
attempt. The affair was on the carpet during the last session; 
but such incredible and extravagant stories were told in the 
House of the monstrous effects of the enthusiasm prevalent 
among the sectaries, and so greedily swallowed by their enemies, that I believe they lost footing by it. And the bad name 
they still have with those who pretend too much contempt to 
examine into their principles and conduct, and are too much 
devoted to the ecclesiastical establishment to hear of the toleration of dissentients, I am apprehensive, will be again made a 
pretext for rejecting their requests. 
</p><p>
The sentiments of our people of fortune and fashion on this 
subject are vastly different from what you have been used to. 
That liberal, catholic, and equitable way of thinking, as to the 
rights of conscience, which is one of the characteristics of a free 
people, and so strongly marks the people of your province, is 
but little known among the zealous adherents to our hierarchy. 
We have, it is true, some persons in the Legislature of generous 
principles both in Religion and Politics; but number, not merit, 
you know, is necessary to carry points there. Besides, the 
clergy are a numerous and powerful body, have great influence 
at home by reason of their connection with and dependence on 
the Bishops and Crown, and will naturally employ all their art 
and interest to depress their rising adversaries; for such they 
must consider dissenters who rob them of the good will of the 
people, and may, in time, endanger their livings and security. 
</p><p>
You are happy in dwelling in a land where those inestimable 
privileges are fully enjoyed; and the public has long felt the 
good effects of this religious as well as civil liberty. Foreigners have been encouraged to settle among you. Industry and 
virtue have been promoted by mutual emulation and mutual 
inspection; commerce and the arts have flourished; and I cannot help attributing those continual exertions of genius which 
appear among you to the inspiration of liberty, and that love 
of fame and knowledge which always accompany it. Religious 
bondage shackles and debilitates the mind, and unfits it for 
every noble enterprise, every expanded prospect. How far 
this is the case with Virginia will more clearly appear when 
the ensuing trial is made. 
</p><p>
I am making all haste in preparing for my journey. It appears as if it would be the first of May before I can start, which 
I can more patiently bear, because I may possibly get no company before that time; and it will answer so exactly with the 
meeting of the synod. George Luckey talks of joining me if I 
can wait till then. I am resolutely determined to come if it is 
in my power. If anything hinders me, it will be most likely 
the indisposition of my mother, who is in a very low state of 
health; and if she should grow worse, I am afraid she will be 
more unwilling to part with my brother, as she will be less able 
to bear a separation. If it should unfortunately happen that I 
should be forced off or give out coming, Luckey on his return 
to Virginia will bring me whatever publications you think 
worth sending, and among others [Caspapini's?]

But whether I come or not, be assured I retain the most ardent affection and esteem for you, and the most cordial gratitude for your many generous kindnesses. It gives me real 
pleasure when I write to you that I can talk in this language 
without the least affectation, and without the suspicion of it, 
and that if I should omit expressing my love for you, your 
friendship can supply the omission; or if I make use of the most 
extravagant expressions of it, your corresponding affection can 
believe them to be sincere. This is a satisfaction and delight 
unknown to all who correspond for business and conveniency, 
but richly enjoyed by all who make pleasure and improvement 
the business of their communications. 
</p><p>
Farewell, 
</p><p>
J. M. 
</p><p>
P. S. You need no longer direct to the care of Mr. Maury.
