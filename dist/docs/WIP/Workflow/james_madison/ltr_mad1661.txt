MY DEAR FRIEND, For a week past the subject of amendments has exclusively occupied the House of Representatives. 
Its progress has been exceedingly wearisome, not only on account of the diversity of opinions that was to be apprehended, 
but of the apparent views of some to defeat, by delaying, a plan 
short of their wishes, but likely to satisfy a great part of their 
companions in opposition throughout the Union. It has been 
absolutely necessary, in order to effect anything, to abbreviate 
debate, and exclude every proposition of a doubtful and unimportant nature. Had it been my wish to have comprehended 
every amendment recommended by Virginia, I should have acted 
from prudence the very part to which I have been led by choice. 
Two or three contentious additions would even now prostrate 
the whole project. 
</p><p>
The Judiciary bill was put off in favor of the preceding subject. It was evident that a longer delay of that would prevent 
any decision on it at this Session. A push was therefore made, 
which did not succeed without strenuous opposition. On Monday the bill will probably be taken up, and be pursued to a final 
question as fast as the nature of the case will allow. 
</p><p>
I find, on looking over the notes of your introductory discourse in the Convention at <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, that it is not possible 
for me to do justice to the substance of it. I am anxious, for 
particular reasons, to be furnished with the means of preserv.g 
this as well as the other arguments in that body, and must beg 
that you will make out and forward me the scope of your reasoning. You have your notes, I know, and from these you can 
easily deduce the argument on a condensed plan. I make this 
request with an earnestness which will not permit you either 
to refuse or delay a compliance.
