DEAR SIR, We arrived here yesterday evening, where we 
have met with Mr. Dawson, just from <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. When he 
left it, eighteen representatives and eight senators had assembled. It is not certain when the deficiencies will be made up. 
The most favorable conjectures postpone it to Monday se'nnight. 
The members attending are chiefly from the Eastward. I do not 
learn that a single member, except Mr. White, is from a State south of Pennsylvania; unless, indeed, D'r Tucker is to be included in the exception. The New Jersey Representatives are 
not yet announced. Mr. Clarke, it is supposed, will be one; Mr. Cadwallader, Mr. Boudinot, and Mr. Skureman, are talked of as the others.

I find that the communication made you from Kentucky corresponds with an official letter to Congress from Governor St. Clair, which speaks of the same emissary, and the same errand. 
Notice has been transmitted of the affair to the executive of 
Virginia, in order that regular steps may be taken, if sufficient 
ground be afforded, for apprehending the incendiary. The 
project of Geo. Morgan for establishing a colony beyond the 
Mississippi is also going on. It is the opinion of Mr. Brown, 
as explained to Mr. Griffin, that emigrations to the Spanish 
Territory will be enticed from Kentucky as rapidly as the 
allurements of the latter place have obtained them from the 
Atlantic States. All these circumstances point out the conduct 
which the new government ought to pursue with regard to the 
Western Country and Spain. 
</p><p>
I dropped you a few lines from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, mentioning the 
unanimity of the electoral vote of South Carolina and Georgia 
for a President, and the manner in which the secondary votes 
were disposed of. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, yours truly and affectionately.
