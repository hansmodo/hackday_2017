DEAR SIR, The Convention came to a final adjournment today. The inclosed is a copy of their act of ratification, with 
the yeas and nays. A variety of amendments have been since 
recommended, several of them highly objectionable, but which 
could not be parried. The minority are to sign an address this 
evening, which is announced to be of a peace-making complexion. Having not seen it, I can give no opinion of my own. I 
wish it may not have a further object. Mr. H y declared, 
previous to the final question, that altho' he should submit as a 
quiet citizen, he should seize the first moment that offered for 
shaking off the yoke in a constitutional way. I suspect the plan 
will be to engage f of the Legislatures in the task of undoing 
the work; or to get a Congress appointed in the first instance 
that will commit suicide on their own authority. 
Yrs, most affect y and respectfully.
