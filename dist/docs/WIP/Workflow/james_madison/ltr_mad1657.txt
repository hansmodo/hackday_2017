HON. SIR, The last letter from my brother A. left me in 
much anxiety for the state of my mother's health. I have ventured to hope, from the silence which has followed, that she has 
been on the recovery. I wish much to hear oftener from the 
family than I do, and would set the example if other occupations, and particularly a very extensive correspondence, would 
permit.

The business goes on still very slowly. We are in a wilderness, without a single footstep to guide us. It is consequently 
necessary to explore the way with great labour and caution. 
Those who may follow will have an easier task. The Bills imposing duties on imports and tonnage have at length got through 
both Houses. The question whether a distinction should be 
made between Nations in Treaty and those not in Treaty was 
finally settled in the negative; so that Great Britain is, in fact, 
put on the same footing with the most favored nation, although 
she has shewn no disposition to treat with the 'United States, 
and will probably be confirmed by such a measure in the belief 
that America, even if under a United Government, would be 
unable to unite her counsels on this subject. The discrimination was struck out of the Bills in consequence of the refusal 
of the Senate to agree to the bills on other terms. They urged, 
in a conference between Committees from the two Houses on 
the subject, that something more efficacious was necessary in 
order to counter-work the restrictions of Great Britain; and 
that they had accordingly appointed a committee for the purpose of devising such a plan. It is very doubtful, however, 
whether it will come to anything, and whether a more moderate 
mode of shewing a determination in the new government to vindicate our commercial interests would not have answered every 
purpose that can be answered at all. If anything should be 
done on the plan of the Senate, it will probably consist of regulations founded on the principle of the British navigation act, 
which will disable her vessels from bringing to this country any 
articles not the growth or manufacture of Great Britain, and 
embarrass her West Indies until the trade to them shall be 
opened to American as it is to British vessels. Bills for establishing the several Departments of war, finance, and foreign 
affairs, have passed the House of Representatives, and are before the Senate. The bills for collecting the Impost and regulating the coasting trade are still before the House of Representatives, but will be pushed through as fast as their length 
and importance will permit.

The subject of amendments to the Constitution will not be 
resumed till the revenue matters are over. I hope it will then 
be duly attended to, and will end in such a recommendation as 
will satisfy moderate opponents. This, however, is but opinion, 
nothing having passed from which any conclusion can be drawn 
with regard to the sentiments of the two Houses, particularly 
the Senate. 
</p><p>
With the most dutiful regards, I am, your affectionate Son.
