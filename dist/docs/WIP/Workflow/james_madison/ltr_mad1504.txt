DEAR SIR, I had intended by this post to commence our 
correspondence with a narrative of what has been done and is 
proposed to be done at the present Session of the General Assembly, but, by your last letter to Mr. Jones, I find that it is 
very uncertain whether this will get to Trenton before you leave 
it for Virginia. I cannot, however, postpone my congratulations on your critical escape from the danger which lay in ambush for you, and your safe return to Trenton. My ramble extended neither into the dangers nor gratifications of yours. It 
was made extremely pleasing by sundry circumstances, but 
would have been more so, I assure you, Sir, if we had been cotemporarys in the route we both passed.

The Indians begin to be unquiet, we hear, both on the North 
West and South East sides of the Ohio. The Spaniards are 
charged with spurring on the latter. As means of obviating 
the dangers, the House of Delegates have resolved to authorize 
the Executive to suspend the surveying of land within the unpurchased limits, and to instruct the Delegation to urge in Congress Treaties with the -Southern Indians, and negociations 
with Spain touching the Mississippi. They also propose to set 
on foot surveys of Potowmac and James Rivers, from their falls 
to their sources. But their principal attention has been, and is 
still, occupied with a scheme proposed for a General Assessment; 47 have carried it against 32. In its present form it excludes all but Christian sects. The Presbyterian Clergy have 
remonstrated against any narrow principles, but indirectly favor 
a more comprehensive establishment. I think the bottom will 
be enlarged, and that a trial will be made of the practicability 
of the project. The successor to <a href='/results.php?tla=beh' rel='colleague'>Mr. Harrison</a> is not yet appointed or nominated. It is in the option of <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>, and I 
fancy he will not decline the serv.e. There will be three vacancies in the Council, for which no nominations have been 
made. Mr. C. Griffith will probably be named, and Mr. W. 
Nicholas. Mr. Roane is also spoken of. 
I am, dear sir, your's sincerely.
