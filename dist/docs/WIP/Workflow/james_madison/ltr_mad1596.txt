DEAR SIR, The newspaper enclosed, with the letter which follows, comprises the information brought me by the mail of yesterday: 
</p><p>
"<a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Feb 3. 
</p><p>
"I enclose a newspaper containing the propositions communicated by Mr. Hancock to the Convention on Thursday last. 
Mr. Samuel Adams, who, contrary to his own sentiments, has 
been hitherto silent in Convention, has given his public and explicit approbation of Mr. Hancock's propositions. We flatter 
ourselves that the weight of these two characters will ensure 
our success, but the event is not absolutely certain. Yesterday 
a committee was appointed, on the motion of a doubtful character, to consider the propositions of Mr. Hancock, and to report 
to-morrow afternoon. We have a majority of federalists on 
this committee, and flatter ourselves the result will be favorable. 
</p><p>
"P. S. We shall probably decide on thursday or friday next, 
when our numbers will amount to about 363." 
</p><p>
With greatest esteem and attachment, I am, D'r Sir, your obt 
and affect serv.
