DEAR SIR, Your two last unacknowledged favors were of 
December 20 and February 6. They were received in Virginia, 
and no opportunity, till the present precarious one by the way 
of Holland, has enabled me to thank you for them.

I returned here about ten days ago from <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, which I 
left a day or two after the dissolution of the Convention. The 
final question on the new Government was put on the 25th of 
June. It was two-fold: 1. Whether previous amendments 
should be made a condition of ratification. 2. Directly on the 
Constitution, in the form it bore. On the first, the decision was 
in the negative, 88 being no, 80 only ay. On the second and 
definitive question, the ratification was affirmed by 89 ayes 
against 79 noes. A number of alterations were then recommended to be considered in the mode pointed out in the Constitution itself. The meeting was remarkably full; two members 
only being absent, and those known to be on the opposite sides 
of the question. The debates, also, were conducted on the 
whole with a very laudable moderation and decorum, and continued until both sides declared themselves ready for the question. And it may be safely concluded that no irregular opposition to the System will follow in that State, at least with the 
countenance of the leaders on that side. What local eruptions may be occasioned by ill-timed or rigorous executions of 
the Treaty of peace against British debtors, I will not pretend 
to say. But although the leaders, particularly Henry and 
Mason, will give no countenance to popular violences, it is not 
to be inferred that they are reconciled to the event, or will give 
it a positive support. On the contrary, both of them declared 
they could not go that length, and an attempt was made under 
their auspices to induce the minority to sign an address to the 
people, which, if it had not been defeated by the general moderation of the party, would probably have done mischief. 
</p><p>
Among a variety of expedients employed by the opponents to 
to gain proselytes, <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> first, and after him Col. Mason, 
introduced the opinions expressed in a letter from you to a correspondent, [Mr. Donald or Skipwith, I believe,] and endeavored to turn the influence of your name even against parts of 
which I knew you approved. In this situation, I thought it 
due to truth, as well as that it would be most agreeable to yourself, and accordingly took the liberty to state some of your 
opinions on the favorable side. I am informed that copies or 
extracts of a letter from you were handed about at the Maryland Convention, with a like view of impeding the ratification.

New Hampshire ratified the Constitution on the 20 ult., and 
made the ninth State. The votes stood 57 for, and 46 against 
the measure. South Carolina had previously ratified by a very 
great majority. The Convention of North Carolina is now sitting. At one moment, the sense of that State was considered 
as strongly opposed to the system. It is now said that the tide 
has been for some time turning, which, with the example of 
other States, and particularly of Virginia, prognosticates a ratification there also. The Convention of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> has been in 
session ever since the 17th ultimo, without having yet arrived 
at any final vote. Two-thirds of the members assembled with 
a determination to reject the Constitution, and are still opposed 
to it in their hearts. The local situation of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, the 
number of ratifying States, and the hope of retaining the federal Government in this City, afford, however, powerful arguments to such men as Jay, Hamilton, the Chancellor, Duane, 
and several others; and it is not improbable that some form of 
ratification will yet be devised, by which the dislike of the opposition may be gratified, and the State, notwithstanding, made 
a member of the new Union.

July 26/L "We just hear that the Convention of this State 
have determined, by a small majority, to exclude from the ratification anything involving a condition, and to content themselves with recommending the alterations wished for.

Crops in Virginia, of all sorts, were very promising when I 
left the State. This was the case also generally throughout the 
States I passed through, with local exceptions, produced in the 
wheat fields by a destructive insect, which goes under the name 
of the Hessian fly. It made its first appearance several years ago 
on Long Island, from which it has spread over half this State 
and a great part of New Jersey, and seems to be making an 
annual progress in every direction.
