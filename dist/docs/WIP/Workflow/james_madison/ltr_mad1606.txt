DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 2 ult was not received 'til my 
arrival here on Monday evening. I found, contrary to my expectation, that not only a very full house had been made on the 
first day, but that it had proceeded to the appointment of the 
President and other officers. <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Pendleton</a> was put into the 
chair without opposition. Yesterday, little more was done than 
settling some forms, and Resolving that no question, general or 
particular, should be propounded 'til the whole plan should be 
considered and debated, clause by clause. This was moved by 
Col. Mason, and, contrary to his expectations, concurred in by 
the other side. To-day, the discussions commenced in Committee of the whole. The Governor has declared the day of previous amendments passed, and thrown himself fully into the federal scale. Henry and Mason made a lame figure, and appeared 
to take different and awkward ground. The federalists are a 
good deal elated by the existing prospect. I dare not, however, 
speak with certainty as to the decision. Kentucky has been 
extremely tainted, is supposed to be generally adverse, and 
every piece of address is going on privately to work on the 
local interests and prejudices.of that and other quarters. 
In haste, I am, D'r Sir, yrs affect'y.
