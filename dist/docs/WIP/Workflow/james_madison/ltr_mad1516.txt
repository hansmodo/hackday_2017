DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
The appointment of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> to the Court of Great Britain is a circumstance which does not contradict my expectations; 
nor can I say that it displeases me. Upon Geographical considerations New England will always have one of the principal 
appointments, and I know of no individual from that quarter who possesses more of their confidence, or would possess more 
of that of the other States; nor do I think him so well fitted for any Court of equal rank as that of <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>. I hope it has 
removed all obstacles to the establishment of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a> at the Court of France.' 
</p><p>
Will not Congress soon take up the subject of Consular 'arrangements? I should suppose them at least of equal moment at present with some of the higher appointments which are likely 
to occupy them. Our friend Mr. Maury is waiting, with a very 
inconvenient suspension of his other plans, the event of the offer 
he has made of his serv.es. I find he considers Ireland as the 
station next to be desired after that of England. He conceives, 
and I believe very justly, that the commercial intercourse between that Country and this will be very considerable, and 
merits our particular cultivation. 
</p><p>
I suppose, from your silence on the subject, that the Western 
posts are still in the hands of Great Britain. Has the subject 
of the vacant lands to be disposed of been revived? What 
other measures are on foot or in comtemplation for paying off 
the public debts ? What payments have been made of late into 
the public Treasury? It is said here that Massachusetts is 
taking measures for urging Rhode Island into the Impost, or 
rendering the Scheme practicable without her concurrence. Is 
it so? 
</p><p>
How many of the States have agreed to change the 8th Article 
of the Confederation? The Legislature of this State passed a 
law for complying with the provisional Act of Congress for 
executing that article as it now stands; the operation of which 
confirms the necessity of changing the article. The law requires, as the Act of Congress does among other things, a list 
of the Houses. If the list does not discriminate the several 
kinds of Houses, how can Congress collect from it the value of 
the improvements, how do justice to all their constituents? 
And how can a discrimination be made in this country, where 
the variety is so infinite and so unsusceptible of description? 
If Congress govern themselves by number alone, this Country 
will certainly appeal to a more accurate mode of carrying the 
present rule of the confederation into practice. The average 
value of the improvements in Virginia is not one-fourth, perhaps 
not one-tenth, of that of the improvements in Pennsylvania or 
New England. Compare this difference with the proportion 
between the value of improvements and that of the soil, and 
what. an immense loss shall we be taxed with? The number of 
buildings will not be a less unjust rule than the number of acres 
for estimating the respective abilities of the States. 
</p><p>
The only proceeding of the late Session of Assembly which 
makes a noise through the Country is that which relates to a 
General Assessment. The Episcopal people are generally for 
it, though I think the zeal of some of them has cooled. The 
laity of the other sects are equally unanimous on the other side. 
So are all the Clergy, except the Presbyterian, who seem as 
ready to set up an establishment which is to take them in as 
they were to pull down that which shut them out. I do not 
know a more shameful contrast than might be found between 
their memorials on the latter and former occasion. 
</p><p>
In one of yourreceived before I left <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> you 
expressed a wish for a better cypher. Since my return to 
<a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> I have been able to get one made out, which will answer 
every purpose. I will either enclose it herewith or send it by 
the gentleman who is already charged with a letter for you. I 
wish much to throw our correspondence into a more regular 
course. I would write regularly every week if I had a regular 
conveyance to <a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>. As it is, I will write as often 
as I can find conveyances. The business of this neighborhood 
which used to go to <a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> is in a great measure 
turned towards <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, which is too circuitous a channel. 
Opportunities in every direction, however, will be henceforward 
multiplied by the advance of the season. If you are not afraid 
of too much loading the mail, I could wish you to enclose in 
yourthe last N. Y. or <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> paper. 
I am, dear Sir, yours most sincerely.
