</p><p>
DEAR Sm, Having been left to myself for some days past, I 
have made use of the opportunity for bestowing on your letter of 
the 20th ult, handed to me on the road, the attention which 
its important contents claimed. The questions which it presents 
for consideration are 1 st . At what time a notification of your 
purpose to retire will be most convenient ? 2. What mode will 
be most eligible ? 3. Whether a valedictory address will be 
requisite or advisable? 4. If either, whether it would be 
more properly annexed to the notification, or postponed to your 
actual retirement? 
</p><p>
The answer to the first question involves two points: first, 
the expediency of delaying the notification; secondly, the propriety of making it before the choice of electors takes place, 
that the people may make the choice with an eye to the circumstances under which the trust is to be executed. On the first 
point, the reasons for as much delay as possible are too obvious 
to need recital. The second, depending on the times fixed in 
the several States, which must be within 34 days preceding the 
first Wednesday in December, requires that the notification 
should be in time to pervade every part of the Union by the 
beginning of November. Allowing six weeks for this purpose, 
the middle of September, or perhaps a little earlier, would 
seem a convenient date for the act. 
</p><p>
2. With regard to the mode, none better occurs than a simple 
publication in the newspapers. If it were proper to address it 
through the medium of the general Legislature, there will be no 
opportunity. Nor does the change of situation seem to admit 
a recurrence to the State governments, which were the channels 
used for the former valedictory address. A direct address to 
the people, who are your only constituents, can be made, I 
think, with most propriety, through the independent channel of 
the press, through which they are, as a constituent Body, usually 
addressed. 
</p><p>
3. On the third question, I think there can be no doubt that 
such an address is rendered proper in itself by the peculiarity 
and importance of the circumstances which mark your situation, 
and advisable by the salutary and operative lessons of which it 
may be made the vehicle. The precedent at your military 
exit might also subject an omission now to conjectures and interpretations which it would not be well to leave room for. 
</p><p>
4. The remaining question is less easily decided. Advantages and objections lie on both sides of the alternative. The 
occasion on which you are necessarily addressing the people 
evidently introduces, most easily and most delicately, any 
voluntary observ.ions that are meditated. In another view, a 
farewell address before the final moment of departure is liable 
to the appearance of being premature and awkward. On the 
opposite side of the alternative, however, a postponement will 
beget a dryness and an abridgment in the first address little 
corresponding with the feelings which the occasion would naturally produce both in the author and the objects of it; and 
though not liable to the above objection, would require a resumption of the subject apparently more forced, and on which 
the impressions having been anticipated and familiarized, and 
the public mind diverted, perhaps, to other scenes, a second 
address would be received with less sensibility and effect than 
if incorporated with the impressions incident to the original 
one. It is possible, too, that, previous to the close of the term, 
circumstances might intervene in relation to public affairs, or 
the succession to the Presidency, which would be more embarrassing, if existing at the time of a valedictory appeal to the 
public, than if unknown at the time of that delicate measure. 
</p><p>
On the whole, my judgment leans to the propriety of blending the acts together; and the more so, as the crisis which will 
terminate your public career will still afford an opportunity, if 
any immediate contingency should call for a supplement to 
your farewell observ.ions. But as more correct views of the 
subject may produce a different result in your mind, I have endeavored to fit the draught enclosed to either determination. 
You will readily observ.that in executing it I have arrived at 
that plainness and modesty of language which you had in view, 
and which, indeed, are so peculiarly becoming the character and 
the occasion; and that I have had little more to do as to the 
matter than to follow the very just and comprehensive outline 
which you had sketched. I flatter myself, however, that in 
everything which has depended on me, much improvement will be 
made before so interesting a paper shall have taken its last form. 
Having thus, sir, complied with your wishes, by proceeding 
on a supposition that the idea of retiring from public life is to 
be carried into execution, I must now gratify my own by hoping 
that a reconsideration of the' measure, in all its circumstances 
and consequences, will have produced an acquiescence in one 
more sacrifice, severe as it may be, to the desires and interests 
of your country. I forbear to enter into the arguments which 
plead for it in my mind, because it would be only repeating 
what I have already taken the liberty of fully explaining. But 
I could not conclude such a letter as the present without a 
repetition of my ardent wishes and hopes that our country may 
not, at this important conjuncture, be deprived of the inestimable advantage of having you at the head of its counsels. 
</p><p>
The period which will close the appointment with which my 
fellow-citizens have honored me being not very distant, and the 
time actually arrived at which their thoughts must be designating the citizen who is to administer the Executive Government 
of the U. S. during the ensuing term, it may be requisite to a 
more distinct expression of the public voice that I should apprize such of my fellow-citizens as may retain their partiality 
towards me, that I am not to be numbered among those out of 
whom a choice is to be made. 
I beg them to be assured that the resolution which dictates 
this intimation has not been taken without the strictest regard 
to the relation which, as a dutiful citizen, I bear to my country; 
and that in withdrawing that tender of my serv.e which silence 
in my situation might imply, I am not influenced by the smallest 
deficiency of zeal for its future interests, or of grateful respect 
for its past kindness, but by the fullest persuasion that such a 
step is compatible with both. 
</p><p>
The impressions under which I entered on the present arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion. In discharge 
of this trust, I can only say that I have contributed towards 
the organization and administration of the Government the best 
exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. For 
any errors which may have flowed from this source, I feel all 
the regret which an anxiety for the public good can excite; not 
without the double consolation, however, arising from a consciousness of their being involuntary, and an experience of the 
candor which will interpret them. If there were any circumstances which could give value to my inferior qualifications for 
the trust, these circumstances must have been temporary. In 
this light was the undertaking viewed when I ventured upon 
it. Being, moreover, still farther advanced into the decline of 
life, I am every day more sensible that the increasing weight 
of years renders the private walks of it in the shade of retirement as necessary as they will be acceptable to me. May I be 
allowed to add that it will be among the highest, as well as the 
purest enjoyments that can sweeten the remnant of my days, to 
partake in a private station, in the midst of my fellow-citizens, 
of that benign influence of good laws under a free Government 
which has been the ultimate object of all our wishes, and in 
which I confide as the happy reward of our cares and labors ? 
May I be allowed further to add, as a consideration far more 
important, that an early example of rotation in an office of so 
high and delicate a nature may equally accord with the republican spirit of our Constitution, and the ideas of liberty and 
safety entertained by the people ? 
</p><p>
(If a farewell address is to be added at the expiration of the 
term, the following paragraph may conclude the present:) 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, a return to my private station, 
according to the purpose with which I quitted it, is the part 
which duty as well as inclination assigns me. In executing it, 
T shall carry with me every tender recollection which gratitude 
to my fellow-citizens can awaken, and a sensibility to the permanent happiness of my country that will render it the object 
of my unceasing vows and most fervent supplications. 
</p><p>
(Should no further address be intended, the preceding clause 
may be omitted, and the present address proceed as follows:) 
</p><p>
In contemplating the moment at which the curtain is to drop 
forever on the public scenes of my life, my sensations anticipate, 
and do not permit me to suspend, the deep acknowledgments required by that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved 
country for the many honors it has conferred on me, for the distinguished confidence it has reposed in me, and for the opportunities I have thus enjoyed of testifying my inviolable attachment by the most stedfast serv.es which my faculties could render. All the returns I have now to make will be in those vows 
which I shall carry with me to my retirement and to my grave, 
that Heaven may continue to favor the people of the United 
States with the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that their 
union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free 
Constitution, which is the work of their own hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every Department 
may be stamped with wisdom and with virtue, and that this 
character may be ensured to it by that watchfulness over public 
serv.ts and public measures which, on one hand, will be necessary to prevent or correct a degeneracy, and that forbearance, 
on the other, from unfounded or indiscriminate jealousies, which 
would deprive the public of the best serv.es by depriving a 
conscious integrity of one of the noblest incitements to perform 
them; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of America under 
the auspices of liberty may be made complete, by so careful a 
preserv.ion and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire them the glorious satisfaction of recommending it to the 
affection, the praise, and the adoption, of every nation which is 
yet a stranger to it. 
And may we not dwell with well-grounded hopes on this flattering prospect, when we reflect on the many ties by which the 
people of America are bound together, and the many proofs they 
have given of an enlightened judgment and a magnanimous patriotism? 
</p><p>
We may all be considered as the children of one common 
country. We have all been embarked in one common cause. 
We have all had our share in common sufferings and common 
successes. The portion of the earth allotted for the theatre of 
our fortunes fulfils our most sanguine desires. All its essential 
interests are the same; whilst the diversities arising from climate, from soil, and from other local and lesserv.eculiarities, 
will naturally form a mutual relation of the parts that must 
give to the whole a more entire independence than has, perhaps, 
fallen to the lot of any other nation. 
</p><p>
To confirm these motives to an affectionate and permanent 
union, and to secure the great objects of it, we have established 
a common Government, which, being free in its principles, being 
founded in our own choice, being intended as the guardian of 
our common rights and the patron of our common interests, and 
wisely containing within itself a provision for its own amendment as experience may point out its errors, seems to promise 
everything that can be expected from such an institution; and 
if supported by wise counsels, by virtuous conduct, and by mutual and friendly allowances, must approach as near to perfection as any human work can aspire, and nearer than any which 
the annals of mankind have recorded. 
</p><p>
With these wishes and hopes I shall make my exit from civil 
life, and I have taken the same liberty of expressing them which 
I formerly used in offering the sentiments which were suggested 
by my exit from military life. If, in either instance, I have 
presumed more than I ought on the indulgence of my fellowcitizens, they will be too generous to ascribe it to any other 
cause than the extreme solicitude which I am bound to feel, and 
which I can never cease to feel, for their liberty, their prosperity, and their happiness.
