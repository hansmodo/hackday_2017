DEAR SIR, Your favors of the 19th December and 7th January came both to hand by yesterday's mail. The Assembly adjourned last night after a session of 97 days. If its importance 
were to be measured by a list of the laws which it has produced, 
all preceding Legislative merit would be eclipsed, the number 
in this instance amounting to 114 or 115. If we recur to the 
proper criterion, no session has, perhaps, afforded less ground 
for applause. Not a single member seems to be pleased with a 
review of what has passed. I was too hasty in informing you 
that an amendment of the Port bill had passed. I was led into 
the error by the mistake of some who told me it had passed the 
Senate, when it had only been agreed to in a Committee of the 
Senate. Instead of passing it, they sent down a repeal of the 
old port bill by way of amendment. This was disagreed to by 
the House of Delegates as indirectly originating. The Senate 
adhered, and the bill was lost. An attempt was then made by 
the adversaries of the port measure to suspend its operation till 
the end of the next session. This also was negatived, so that 
the old bill is left as it stood, without alteration. Defective as 
it is, particularly in putting citizens of other States on the footing of foreigners, and destitute as it is of proper concomitant 
provisions, it was judged best to hold it fast, and trust to a succeeding Assembly for amendments.

The navigation system for the State, after having been prepared at great length by Mr. G. Baker, was procrastinated in 
a very singular manner, and finally died away of itself, without 
anything being done, except a short act passed yesterday in 
great hurry, imposing a tonnage of 5 shillings on the vessels of 
foreigners not having treated with the United States.

This failure of local measures in the commercial line, instead 
of reviving the original propositions for a general plan, revived 
that of Mr. Tyler for the appointment of Commissioners to meet 
Commissioners from the other States on the subject of general 
regulations. It went through by a very great majority, being 
opposed only by Mr. M. Smith and Mr. Corbin. The expedient is no doubt liable to objections, and will probably miscarry. I think, however, it is better than nothing; and as a 
recommendation of additional powers to Congress is within the 
purview of the Commission, it may possibly lead to better consequences than at first occur. The Commissioners first named 
were the attorney, Doctor W. Jones of the Senate, and myself. 
The importunity of Mr. Page procured the addition of S* George 
Tucker, who is sensible, federal, and skilled in commerce, to 
whom was added, on the motion of I know not whom, Mr. M. 
Smith, who is at least exceptionable in the second quality, having made unceasing war during the session against the idea of 
bracing the federal system. In the senate, a further addition 
was made of Col. Mason, Mr. D. Ross, and Mr. Ronald. The 
name of the latter was struck out at his desire. The others 
stand. It is not unlikely that this multitude of associates will 
stifle the thing in its birth. By some it was probably meant to 
do so.

I am glad to find that Virginia has merit where you are, and 
should be more so if I saw greater reason for it. The bill 
which is considered at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> as a compliance with the requisitions of Congress, is more so in appearance than reality. 
It will bring no specie into the Treasury, and but little Continental paper. Another act has since passed which professes to 
comply more regularly with the demand of Congress, but this 
will fail as to specie and as to punctuality. It will probably 
procure the indents called for, and fulfils the views of Congress 
in making those of other States receivable into our Treasury. 
Among the acts passed since my last, I must not omit an economical revision of the Civil list. The saving will amount to 
5 or 6,000 pounds. The Governor was reduced by the House 
of Delegates to 800, to which the Senate objected. Which 
receded I really forget. The Council to 2,000; the Attorney 
to 200; Register from 1,100 to 800; Auditor and Solicitor 
from 4 to 300; Speaker of House of Delegates to 40s. per day, 
including daily pay as a member; and of Senate to 205, &c.; 
Delegates to Congress to six dollars per day. The act, however, is not to commence till November next.
