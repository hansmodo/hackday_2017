DEAR SIR, My last was of the 22d instant. I have since received yours covering the paper now returned, that covering 
the report of the Commissioners of accounts between the United 
States and the particular States, and that of the 21st instant. 
The intermediate one of the 14th was left by mistake in a secure 
place by the person who was to bring it up from <a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, 
and is not yet arrived. The delay has been inconvenient, as it 
deprives me of part of the publication, which I wish to see in all 
its parts before I formed a regular view of any. As I intimated 
in my last, I have forced myself into the task of a reply. I can 
truly say I find it the most grating one I ever experienced; and 
the more so, as I feel at every step I take the want of counsel 
on some points of delicacy, as well as of information as to sundry matters of fact. I shall be still more sensible of the latter 
want when I get to the attack on French proceedings, and perhaps to the last topic proposed by the writer, if I ever do get to 
it. As yet I have but roughly and partially gone over the first; 
and being obliged to proceed in scraps of time, with a distaste 
to the subject, and a distressing lassitude from the excessive and 
continued heat of the season, I cannot say when I shall finish 
even that. One thing that particularly vexes me is, that- 1 foreknow, from the prolixity and pertinacity of the writer, that the 
business will not be terminated by a single fire, and, of course, 
that I must return to the charge in order to prevent a triumph 
without a victory.

Do you know what is the idea of France with regard to the 
defensive quality of the guaranty, and of the criterion between 
offensive and defensive war, which I find differently defined by different jurists; also, what are the ideas of the President on these 
points? I could lay my course with more advantage through 
some other parts of the subject if I could also know how far he 
considers the Proclamation as expressing a neutrality, in the 
sense given to that term, or how far he approves the vindication 
of it on that ground.

I am sorry to find the journey to Virginia, from which useful 
lessons were hoped, ending in a confirmation of errors. I can 
only account for it by supposing the public sentiment to have 
been collected from tainted sources, which ought to have suggested to a cautious and unbiassed mind the danger of confiding in them. The body of the people are unquestionably attached to the Union, and friendly to the Constitution; but that 
they have no dissatisfaction at the measures and spirit of the 
Government, I consider as notoriously untrue. I am the more 
surprised at the misconception of our Friend, as the two latest 
sources consulted, the two brothers, I mean, are understood to 
be both of them rightly disposed, as well as correctly informed.

I have got my ploughs at last. They are fine ones, and much 
admired. Repeat my thanks to D'r Logan, if you have an opportunity and think of it. The patent plough is worth your looking at, if you should visit his farm. You will see your theory 
of a mould-board more nearly realized than in any other instance, and with the advantage of having the iron wing, which 
in common bar shares or in great lies useless under the wood, 
turned up into the sweep of the board, and relieving it from the 
brunt of the friction. By fixing the colter, which is detached, 
to the point of the share, it will, I think, be nearly complete. I 
propose to have one so constructed. The detached form may 
answer best in old, clear ground, but will not stand the shocks 
of our rough and rooty land, especially in the hands of our 
ploughmen. 
Little wheat having been yet tried in bread, I cannot say how 
the quality will turn out. The more I see and hear of it, the 
more I fear it will be worse than was at first supposed. The 
corn suffers now for want of rain, but appearances as to that 
article are, on the whole, very flattering. The worst effect of 
the dry weather at present felt is the extreme hardness of the 
earth, which makes ploughing, particularly in fallow land, but 
barely possible. So many heavy rains on ground wet for six 
months, succeeded by the present hot spell, has almost beat it 
and baked it into brick.
