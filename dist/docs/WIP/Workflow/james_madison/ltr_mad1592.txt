DEAR SIR, I have been favored since my last with yours of 
the 10th instant, with a copy of the Governor's letter to the 
Assembly. I do not know what impression the letter may make 
in Virginia. It is generally understood here that the arguments contained in it in favor of the Constitution are much 
stronger than the objections which prevented his assent. His 
arguments are forcible in all places, and with all persons. His 
objections are connected with his particular way of thinking on 
the subject, in which many of the adversaries to the Constitution do not concur.

The information from <a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> by the mail on the evening before last has not removed our suspense. The following is an 
extract of a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. King</a>, dated on the 16th instant: 
</p><p>
" We may have 360 members in our Convention. Not more 
than 330 have yet taken their seats. Immediately after the 
settlement of elections, the Convention resolved that they would 
consider and freely debate on each paragraph, without taking 
a question on any of them individually; and that on the question whether they would ratify, each member should be at liberty to discuss the plan at large. This Resolution seems to 
preclude the idea of amendments; and hitherto the measure has 
not been suggested. I, however, do not, from this circumstance, 
conclude that it may not hereafter occur. The opponents of 
the Constitution moved that Mr. Gerry should be requested to 
take a seat in the Convention, to answer such enquiries as the 
Convention should make concerning facts which happened in 
the passing of the Constitution. Although this seems to be a 
very irregular proposal, yet, considering the jealousies which 
prevail with those who made it, who are certainly not the most 
enlightened part of the Convention, and the doubt of the issue 
had it been made a trial of strength, several friends of the Constitution united with the opponents, and the resolution was 
agreed to, and Mr. Gerry has taken his seat. To-morrow, we 
are told, certain enquiries are to be moved for by the opposition, and that Mr. Gerry, under the idea of stating facts, is to 
state his reasons, &c. This will be opposed, and we shall, on 
the division, be able to form some idea of our relative strength. 
From the men who are in favor of the Constitution every reasonable explanation will be given, and arguments really new, 
and in my judgment most excellent, have been and will be produced in its support. But what will be its fate, I confess I am 
unable to discern. No question ever classed the people of this 
State in a more extraordinary manner, or with more apparent 
firmness." 
A Congress of seven States was made up on Monday. Mr. 
C. Griffin has been placed in the chair. This is the only step 
yet taken.

I remain, with the highest respect and attachment, yours affectionately.
