DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
The proposed Constitution still engrosses the public attention. The elections for the Convention here are but just over 
and promulged. From the returns, (excepting those from Kentucky, which are not yet known,) it seems probable, though not 
absolutely certain, that a majority of the members elect are 
friends to the Constitution. The superiority of abilities, at 
least, seems to lie on that side. The characters of most note 
which occur to me are marshaled thus : For the Constitution, 
Pendleton, Wythe, Blair, Lines', Marshall, Doctor W. Jones, G. 
Nicholas, Wilson Nicholas, Gab 1 Jones, Thomas Lewis, F. Corbin, Ralph Wormley, Jr., White of Frederick, <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel=''>General Gates</a>, 
General A. Stephens, Archibald Stuart, Zach y Johnson, Doctor 
Stuart, Parson Andrews, H. Lee, Jr., Bushrod Washington, considered as a young gentleman of talents; against the Constitution, <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>, Mason, Harrison, Grayson, Tyler, M. Smith, 
W. Ronald, Lawson, Bland, Wm. Cabell, Dawson. 
</p><p>
The Governor is so temperate in his opposition, and goes so 
far with the friends of the Constitution, that he cannot properly 
be classed with its enemies. Monroe is considered by some as 
an enemy, but I believe him to be a friend. There are other 
individuals of weight whose opinions are unknown to me. R. 
H. Lee is not elected. His brother, F. L. Lee, is a warm friend 
to the Constitution, as I am told; but, also, is not elected. So 
are John and Mann Page. 
The adversaries take very different grounds of opposition. 
Some are opposed to the substance of the plan; others, to particular modifications only. <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> is supposed to aim at 
disunion. Col. Mason is growing every day more bitter and 
outrageous in his efforts to carry his point, and will probably, 
in the end, be thrown by the violence of his passions into the 
politics of <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>. The preliminary question will be, 
whether previous alterations shall be insisted on or not. 
Should this be carried in the affirmative, either a conditional 
ratification or a proposal for a new Convention will ensue. In 
either event, I think the Constitution and the Union will be 
both endangered. It is not to be expected that the States which 
have ratified will reconsider their determinations, and submit to 
the alterations prescribed by Virginia. And if a second Convention should be formed, it is as little to be expected that the 
same spirit of compromise will prevail in it as produced an 
amicable result to the first. It will be easy, also, for those who 
have latent views of disunion, to carry them on under the mask 
of contending for alterations, popular in some, but inadmissible 
in other parts of the United States. 
</p><p>
The real sense of the people of this State cannot be easily ascertained. They are certainly attached, and with warmth, to a 
continuance of the Union, and I believe a large majority of the 
most intelligent and independent are equally so to the plan 
under consideration. On a geographical view of them, almost 
all the Counties in the Northern Neck have elected federal 
deputies. The Counties on the South side of James River have 
pretty generally elected adversaries to the Constitution. The 
intermediate district is much chequered in this respect. The 
Counties between the blue ridge and the Alleghany have chosen 
friends to the Constitution, without a single exception. Those 
westward of the latter have, as I am informed, generally though 
not universally, pursued the same rule. Kentucky it is supposed 
will be divided. 
</p><p>
Having been in Virginia but a few weeks, I can give you little account of other matters, and none of your private affairs or 
connections, particularly of your two nephews. 
</p><p>
The winter here, as everywhere else in the United States, was 
very severe, which, added to short crops of corn, threatened a 
great scarcity and a high price. It is found, however, that 
neither of these evils has taken place. Corn may be purchased 
for 2 dollars, and even 10s. per barrel. Tobacco is as low at 
<a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> as 18s. pr c., and not higher at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> than 
22 or 23s. There is at present a very promising spring, especially in the article of fruit. The night before last was so cold 
as to produce an alarm for the vegetation of all sorts, but it 
does not appear that anything less vulnerable than young cucumbers had been injured. 
</p><p>
I shall ask the favor of Mr. Griffin to send you by Mr. Paradise, or if he should be gone by some other hand, the Debates 
of the Conventions in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, and any 
other publications worth your reading. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your affectionate friend and serv.
