DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 14th came to hand yesterday. 
You were right in saying " that the Northern Cocks are true 
game," but have erred in adding, "that they die hard on the 
Representation bill." Their perseverance has gained them a 
final victory. The bill passed on friday last in the form in 
which it was sent from the Senate; that is, with the distribution 
of 120 members among the States, and the provision for a second census expunged. It was carried in the Senate by a majority of one, and in the House of Representatives by a majority 
of two only. It now remains with the President. The history 
of this subject involves many unpleasing circumstances, and the 
result appears to me absolutely irreconcileable with the Constitution. The business next to be taken up are the reports 
from the Treasury on the new duties on trade, the enlargement 
of the times for subscribing to the funding system, including the 
assumption part of it, and a further assumption of the remaining State debts. The last alone is likely to become doubtful, 
and even that I consider as gaining converts daily. The two 
first will be urged, as, in the one case, a reasonable indulgence 
to such as have not obtained due information within the time 
limited; and the other, as an inevitable consequence of the military augmentation provided for the Western defence. The 
Militia bill, which originated in the House of Representatives, 
is before the Senate; and the Mint, which originated in the latter, will receive a decision on its 3 d reading in the former tomorrow. We have no late information from Europe. That 
from S* Domingo paints the distress of the Island in the most 
gloomy colours. The gambling system, which has been pushed 
to such an excess, is beginning to exhibit its explosions. D . . . , 
of N. York, the Prince of the tribe of speculators, has just become a victim to his enterprizes, and involves an unknown number to an unknown amount in his fate. It is said by some that 
his operations have extended to several millions of dollars, that 
they have been carried on by usurious loans from 3 to 6 per 
cent, per month, and that every description and gradation of 
persons, from the Church to the Stews, are among the dupes of 
his dexterity and the partners of his distress. 
</p><p>
With the highest esteem and affection, I remain, dear sir, unalterably, your friend and serv.
