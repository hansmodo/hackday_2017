DEAR SIR, Since my last I have been furnished with the 
inclosed copy of the letter from the Senators of this State to 
its Legislature. It is well calculated to keep alive the disaffection to the Government, and is accordingly applied to that use 
by violent partizans. I understand the letter was written by 
the first* subscriber of it, as, indeed, is pretty evident from the 
style and strain of it. The other,f it is said, subscribed it with 
reluctance. I am less surprised that this should have been the 
case than that he should have subscribed it at all. 
</p><p>
My last information from <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> is contained in the following extract from a letter of the 28th of November, from an 
intelligent member of the House of Delegates: " The revenue 
Bill, which proposes a reduction of the public taxes one-fourth 
below the last year's amount, is with the Senate. Whilst this 
business was before the House of Delegates a proposition was 
made to receive Tobacco and Hemp as commutables, which was 
negatived, the House determining still to confine the collection 
to specie and to specie warrants. Two or three petitions have 
been presented which asked a general suspension of executions 
for twelve months; they were read, but denied a reference. 
The Assembly have passed an Act for altering the time for 
choosing Representatives to Congress, which is now fixed to be 
on the third Monday in September, suspending the powers of 
the Representative until the February after his election. This 
change was made to suit the time of the annual meeting of 
Congress. The fate of the amendments proposed by Congress 
to the GEN'L Government is still in suspense. In a committee 
of the whole House, the first ten were acceded to with little 
opposition; for on a question taken on each separately, there 
was scarcely a dissenting voice. On the two last a debate of 
some length took place, which ended in rejection. Mr. Edmund 
Randolph, who advocated all the others, stood on this contest 
in the front of opposition. His principal objection was pointed 
against the word 'retained,' in the eleventh proposed amendment, and his argument, if I understood it, was applied in this 
manner: that as the rights declared in the first ten of the proposed amendments were not all that a free people would require 
the exercise of, and that as there was no criterion by which it 
could be determined whether any other particular right was 
retained or not, it would be more safe, and more consistent 
with the spirit of the 1st and 17th amendments proposed by 
Virginia, that this reserv.ion against constructive power 
should operate rather as a provision against extending the 
powers of Congress by their own authority, than a protection 
to rights reducible to no definite certainty. But others, among 
whom I am one, see not the force of this distinction; for by 
preventing an extension of power in that Body, from which 
danger is apprehended, safety will be insured, if its powers be 
not too extensive already; and so, by protecting the rights of 
the people and of the States, an improper extension of power 
will be prevented, and safety made equally certain. If the 
House should agree to the Resolution for rejecting the two last 
I am of opinion it will bring the whole into hazard again; as 
some who have been decided friends to the ten first think it 
would be unwise to adopt them without the 11 and 12th. 
Whatever may be the fate of the amendments submitted by 
Congress, it is probable that an application for further amendments will be made by this Assembly; for the opposition to the 
Federal Constitution is, in my opinion, reduced to a single 
point the power of direct taxation. Those who wish the 
change are desirous of repeating the application, while those 
who wish it not are indifferent on the subject, supposing that 
Congress will not propose a change which would take from 
them a power so necessary for the accomplishment of those 
objects which are confided to their care. Mess Joseph Jones 
and Spencer Roane are appointed Judges of the General Court, 
to fill the vacancies occasioned by the death of Mr. Carey, and 
the removal of Mr. Mercer to the Court of Appeals." 
</p><p>
The difficulty started against the amendments is really unlucky, and the more to be regretted as it springs from a friend 
to the Constitution. It is a still greater cause of regret, if the 
distinction be, as it appears to me, altogether fanciful. If a 
line can be drawn between the powers granted and the rights 
retained, it would seem to be the same thing whether the latter 
be secured by declaring that they shall not be abridged, or that 
the former shall not be extended. If no such line can be drawn, 
a declaration in either form would amount to nothing. If the 
distinction were just, it does not seem to be of sufficient importance to justify the risk of losing the amendments, of furnishing 
a handle to the disaffected, and of arming, N. Carolina with a 
pretext, if she be disposed to prolong her exile from the Union.

SIR, We have now the honor of inclosing the proposition 
of amendments to the Constitution of the United States that 
has been finally agreed upon by Congress. We can assure you, 
Sir, that nothing on our part has been omitted to procure the 
success of those radical amendments proposed by the Convention and approved by the Legislature of our country, which, as 
our Constituent, we shall always deem our duty with respect 
and reverence to obey. The journal of the Senate, herewith 
transmitted, will at once show how exact and how unfortunate 
we have been in this business. It is impossible for us not to 
see the necessary tendency to consolidated empire in the natural 
operation of the Constitution, if no further amended than now 
proposed. And it is equally impossible for us not to be apprehensive for Civil Liberty, when we know no instance in the 
records of History that shew a people ruled in freedom when 
subject to an undivided Government, and inhabiting a Territory 
so extensive as that of the United States, and when, as it seems 
to us, the nature of men and things join to prevent it. The 
impracticability, in such case, of carrying representation sufficiently near to the people for procuring their confidence, and 
consequent obedience, compels a resort to fear, resulting from 
great force and excessive power in Government. Confederated 
Republics, when the federal hand is not possessed of absorbing 
power, may permit the existence of freedom, whilst it preserv. 
union, strength, and safety. Such amendments, therefore, as 
may secure against the annihilation of the State Governments, 
we devoutly wish to see adopted. 
</p><p>
If a persevering application to Congress from the States that 
have desired such amendments should fail of its objects, we are 
disposed to think, reasoning from causes to effects, that unless 
a dangerous apathy should invade the public mind, it will not 
be many years before a Constitutional number of Legislatures 
will be found to demand a Convention for the purpose. We 
have sent a complete set of the Journals of each House of Congress, and thro' the appointed Channel will be the Acts that 
have passed this Session. In these will be seen the extent and 
nature of the Judiciary, the estimated expenses of the Government, and the means so far adopted of defraying the latter. 
</p><p>
We beg, Sir, to be presented with all duty to the House of 
Representatives, and to assure you that we are, with every sentiment of respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient and very 
humble serv.ts, 
</p><p>
RICHARD HENRY LEE, 
WILLIAM GRAYSON. 
</p><p>
The complete set of Journals is ordered to be sent to each 
State by the respective Clerks, with the laws. They are not 
now ready.
