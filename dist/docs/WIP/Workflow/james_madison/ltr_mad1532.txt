DEAR SIR, The proceedings of the Assembly since my last, 
dated this day week, have related: 1. To the Bill for establishing Religious freedom in the Revisal. 2. A Bill concerning 
British debts. 3. A Bill concerning the Proprietary interest in 
the Northern neck. 4. For reforming the County Courts. The 
first employed the House of Delegates several days, the preamble being the principal subject of contention. It at length 
passed without alteration. The Senate, I am told, have exchanged, after equal altercation, the preamble of the revisal for 
the last clause in the Declaration of Rights; an exchange which 
was proposed in the House of Delegates and negatived by a 
considerable majority. I do not learn that they have made, or 
will make, any other alteration.

The Bill for the payment of British debts is nearly a transcript of that which went through the two Houses last year, except that it leaves the periods of instalment blank, and gives the 
creditor an opportunity of taking immediate execution for the 
whole debt, if the debtor refuses to give security for complying 
with the instalments. The Bill was near being put off to the 
next session on the second reading. A majority were for it; 
but having got inadvertently into a hobble, from the manner in 
which the question was put, the result was, that Monday next 
should be appointed for its consideration. The arrival and 
sentiments of <a href='/results.php?tla=wlg' rel='acquaintance co-worker'>Col. Grayson</a> will be favorable to some provision 
on the subject. A clause is annexed to the Bill authorising the 
Executive to suspend its operation, in case Congress shall signify the policy of so doing. The general cry is, that the Treaty 
ought not to be executed here until the posts are surrendered, 
and an attempt will be made to suspend the operation of the 
Bill on that event, or, at least, on the event of a positive declaration from Congress that it ought to be put in force. The 
last mode will probably be fixed on, notwithstanding its departure from the regular course of proceeding, and the embarrassment in which it may place Congress.

The Bill for reforming the County Courts proposes to select 
five Justices, who are to sit quarterly, be paid scantily, and to 
possess the civil jurisdiction of the County courts, and the criminal jurisdiction of the General Court, under certain restrictions. It is meant as a substitute for the Assize system, to all 
the objections against which it is liable, without possessing its 
advantages. It is uncertain whether it will pass at all, or what 
form it will finally take. I am inclined to think it will be 
thrown out. The Bill relating to the Northern Neck passed 
the House of Delegates yesterday. It removes the records into 
the Land office here, assimilates locations of surplus land to the 
general plan, and abolishes the Quit-rent. It was suggested 
that the latter point was of a judiciary nature, that it involved 
questions of fact, of law, and of the Treaty of peace, and that 
the representatives of the late proprietor ought at least to be 
previously heard, according to the request of their Agent. Very 
little attention was paid to these considerations, and the bill 
passed almost unanimously.
