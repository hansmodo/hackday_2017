DEAR SIR, My last was committed to Major Rogers, of your 
County, who embarked some days ago from this place for Virginia. I have been since favoured with yours of the 7th instant, 
and am much and truly gratified with the proof it contains of 
your good health.

We have not yet either the President or vice President on the 
ground. The former is expected in a few days. The latter, we 
are told, will certainly come in to-morrow evening. Preparations are making by the Inhabitants for the reception of both; 
for that of the former in a very splendid style.

The House of Representatives is still occupied with the impost. It is a subject which is not very simple in itself, and is 
rendered not a little difficult by the diversity of State regulations; by the total want of regulations in several States; by the 
case of Rhode Island and North Carolina, not yet parties to the 
Constitution; and by the law of Virginia disqualifying State 
officers, Judiciary, as well as others, from executing federal 
functions. The latter circumstance seems to threaten additional delay, since it may require some special provision of a 
Judiciary nature for cases of seizure, <fec., until the Judiciary 
department can be systematically arranged; and may even then 
oblige the federal Legislature to extend its provisions farther 
than might otherwise be necessary. In settling the rate of duties, the ideas of different quarters, Northern and Southern, 
Eastern and Western, do not entirely accord; but the difficulties are adjusted as easily as could be well expected. If the 
duties should be raised too high, the error will proceed as much 
from the popular ardor to throw the burden of revenue on 
trade as from the premature policy of stimulating manufactures.

Several vessels are just arrived from England. They report 
that the King was getting much better, and the nation flattered 
with a hope of his being soon able to resume the reins of Government. Should his recovery amount to a lucid interval only, 
and successive relapses mark his future situation, the case will 
become more singular and perplexing than ever.
