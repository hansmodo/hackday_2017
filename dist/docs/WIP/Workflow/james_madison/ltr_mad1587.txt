DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 17th of September, with sundry other and packets, came duly by the last packet. 
Such of them as were addressed to others were duly forwarded. 
The three boxes, marked I. M., G. W., and A. D., it appears, 
were never shipped from Havre. Whenever they arrive your 
commands with regard to the two last shall be attended to, as 
well as those relating to some of the contents of the first. I 
have not been able to get any satisfactory account of William 
S. Browne. Alderman Broom tells me that he professed to receive the money from him for the use of Mr. Burke. I shall 
not lose sight of the subject, and will give you the earliest information of the result of my enquiries. 
</p><p>
The annexed list of trees will shew you that I have ventured 
to substitute half a dozen sorts of apples in place of the pippins 
alone, and to add 8 other sorts of American Trees, including 
twenty of the Sugar maple. They were obtained from a Mr. 
Prince, in the neighborhood of this city, who deals largely in 
this way, and is considered as a man of worth. I learn from 
him that he has executed various commissions for Europe and 
the West Indies, as well as places less distant, and that he has 
been generally very successful in preserv.g the trees from perishing by such distant transplantations. He does not use moss, 
as you prescribe, but encloses the roots in a bag of earth. As 
moss is not to be got, he says, it is uncertain whether necessity 
or choice gives the preference to the latter. I enclose a catalogue of his nursery. and annex the price of the sample I send 
you, that you may, if you incline, give orders for any other supply. I doubt whether the Virginia Red Birds are found in this 
part of America. Opossums are not rare in the milder parts 
of New Jersey, but are very rare this far Northward. I shall, 
nevertheless, avail myself of any opportunities which may happen for procuring and forwarding both. 
</p><p>
Along with the box of trees, I send by the packet, to the care 
of Mr. Limosin, two barrels of New-town pippins, and two of 
Cranberries. In one of the latter the Cranberries are put up 
dry, in the other in water; the opinions and accounts differing 
as to the best mode, you will note the event of the experiment. 
</p><p>
The Constitution proposed by the late Convention engrosses 
almost the whole political attention of America. All the Legislatures, except that of Rhode Island, which has assembled, have 
agreed in submitting it to State Conventions. Virginia has 
set the example of opening a door for amendments, if the Convention there should chuse to propose them. Maryland has 
copied it. The States which preceded referred the Constitution, as recommended by the General Convention, to be ratified 
or rejected as it stands. The Convention of Pennsylvania is 
now sitting. There are about 44 or 45 on the affirmative, and 
about half that number on the opposite side; a considerable 
number of the Constitutional party, as it was called, having 
joined the other party in espousing the Federal Constitution. 
The returns of deputies for the Convention of Connecticut are 
known, and prove, as is said by those who know the men, that 
a very great majority will adopt it in that State. 
</p><p>
The event in Massachusetts lies in greater uncertainty. The 
friends of the New Government continue to be sanguine. New 
Hampshire, from every account, as well as from some general 
inducements felt there, will pretty certainly be on the affirmative side. So will New Jersey and Delaware. <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> is 
much divided. She will hardly dissent from New England, particularly if the conduct of the latter should coincide with that 
of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A more formidable opposition is likely to be made in Maryland than was at first conjectured. Mr. Mercer, it seems, who was a member of the Convention, though his attendance was but for a short time, is become an auxiliary to Chase. Johnson, the Carrolls, Governor 
Lee, and most of the other characters of weight, are on the 
other side. Mr. T. Stone died a little before the Government 
was promulged. 
</p><p>
The body of the people in Virginia, particularly in the upper 
and lower Country, and in the Northern neck, are, as far as I 
can gather, much disposed to adopt the New Constitution. The 
middle Country, and the South side of James River, are principally in the opposition to it. As yet a large majority of the 
people are under the first description; as yet, also, are a majority of the Assembly. What change may be produced by the 
united influence and exertions of <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=gem' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Mason</a>, and 
the Governor, with some' pretty able auxiliaries, is uncertain. 
My information leads me to suppose there must be three parties 
in Virginia. The first, for adopting without attempting amendments. This includes <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> and the other deputies who signed the Constitution, <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Pendleton</a>, (<a href='/results.php?tla=tom' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Marshall</a>, 
I believe,) Mr. Nicholas, Mr. Corbin, Mr. Zach y Johnson, Col. 
Innes, (Mr. B. Randolph, as I understand,) Mr. Harvey, Mr. 
Gabriel Jones, Doctor Jones, <fec., &c. At the head of the second party, which urges amendments, are the Governor and <a href='/results.php?tla=gem' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Mason</a>. These do not object to the substance of the Government, but contend for a few additional guards in favor of the 
rights of the States and of the people. I am not able to enumerate the characters which fall in with their ideas, as distinguished from those of a third class, at the head of which is Mr. 
Henry. This class concurs at present with the patrons of 
amendments, but will probably contend for such as strike at 
the essence of the system, and must lead to an adherence to the 
principle of the existing confederation, which most thinking 
men are convinced is a visionary one, or to a partition of the 
Union into several Confederacies. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=beh' rel='colleague'>Mr. Harrison</a>, the late Governor, is with <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>. So 
are a number of others. The General and Admiralty Courts, 
with most of the Bar, oppose the Constitution, but on what particular grounds I am unable to say. General Nelson, Mr. John 
Page, Col. Bland, &c., are also opponents, but on what principle and to what extent I am equally at a loss to say. In general, I must note that I speak with respect to many of these 
names from information that may not be accurate, and merely 
as I should do in a free and confidential conversation with you. 
I have not yet heard Mr. Wythe's sentiments on the subject. 
Doctor McClurg, the other absent deputy, is a very strenuous 
defender of the new Government. <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> is the great adversary who will render the event precarious. He is, I find, 
with his usual address, working up every possible interest into 
a spirit of opposition. 
</p><p>
It is worthy of remark, that whilst in Virginia, and some of 
the other States in the middle and Southern Districts of the 
Union, the men of intelligence, patriotism, property, and independent circumstances, are thus divided, all of this description, 
</p><p>
with a few exceptions, in the Eastern States, and most of the 
Middle States, are zealously attached to the proposed Constitution. In New England, the men of, the principal officers 
of Government, the Judges and lawyers, the Clergy, and men 
of property, furnish only here and there an adversary. It is 
not less worthy of remark, that in Virginia, where the mass of 
the people have been so much accustomed to be guided by their 
rulers on all new and intricate questions, they should on the 
present, which certainly surpasses the judgment of the greater 
part of them, not only go before, but contrary to their most 
popular leaders. And the phenomenon is the more wonderful, 
as a popular ground is taken by all the adversaries to the new 
Constitution. Perhaps the solution in both these cases would 
not be very difficult; but it would lead to observ.ions too diffusive, and to you unnecessary. I will barely observ.that the 
case in Virginia seems to prove that the body of sober and 
steady people, even of the lower order, are tired of the vicissitudes, injustice, and follies, which have so much characterized 
public measures, and are impatient for some change which promises stability and repose. 
</p><p>
The proceedings of the present Assembly are more likely to 
cherish than remove this disposition. I find <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> has 
carried a Resolution for prohibiting the importation of Rum, 
brandy, and other ardent spirits; and if I am not misinformed, 
all manufactured leather, hats, and sundry other articles, are 
included in the prohibition. Enormous duties, at least, are 
likely to take place on the last and many other articles. A 
project of this sort, without the concurrence of the other States, 
is little short of madness. With such concurrence, it is not 
practicable without resorting to expedients equally noxious to 
liberty and economy. The consequences of the experiment in a 
single State as unprepared for manufactures as Virginia may 
easily be preconceived. 
</p><p>
The Revised Code will not be resumed. <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> is an 
inveterate adversary to it. Col. Mason made a regular and 
powerful attack on the port Bill, but was left in a very small 
minority. I found at the last session that that regulation was 
not to be shaken, though it certainly owes its success less to its 
principal merits than to collateral and casual considerations. 
The popular ideas are, that by favoring the collection of duties 
on imports, it saves the solid property from direct taxes; and 
that it injures Great Britain by lessening the advantage she has 
over other nations in the trade of Virginia. 
</p><p>
We have no certain information from the three Southern 
States concerning the temper relative to the new Government. 
It is in general favorable, according to the vague accounts we 
have. Opposition, however, will be made in each. Mr. Wiley 
Jones and Governor Caswell have been named as opponents in 
North Carolina. 
</p><p>
So few particulars have come to hand concerning the state of 
things in Georgia, that I have nothing to add, on that subject, 
to the contents of my last by Commodore Jones. 
</p><p>
We have two or three States only yet met for Congress. As 
many more can be called in, when their attendance will make a 
quorum. It continues to be problematical whether the interregnum will not be spun out through the winter. 
</p><p>
We remain in great uncertainty here with regard to a war in 
Europe. Reports and suspicions are strongly on the side of one. 
Such an event may be considered in various relations to this 
country. It is pretty certain, I think, that if the present lax state of our General Government should continue, we shall not only lose certain capital advantages which might be drawn from it, but be in danger of being plunged into difficulties, 
which may have a very serv.us effect on our future fortunes.
