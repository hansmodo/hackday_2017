</p><p>
DEAR SIR, I acknowledged from <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> your favor 
of the 11th May. On my return to <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>, I found the copy 
of your notes brought along with it by Mr. Doradour. I have 
looked them over carefully myself, and consulted several judicious friends in confidence. We are all sensible that the freedom of your strictures on some particular measures and opinions 
will displease their respective abettors. But we equally concur in thinking that this consideration ought not to be weighed 
against the utility of your plan. We think both the facts and 
remarks which you have assembled too valuable not to be made 
known, at least to those for whom you destine them, and speak 
of them to one another in terms which I must not repeat to you. 
Mr. Wythe suggested that it might be better to put the number 
you may allot to the University into the library, rather than to 
distribute them among the students. In the latter case, the 
stock will be immediately exhausted. In the former, the discretion of the professors will make it serv.the students as they 
successively come in. Perhaps, too, an indiscriminate gift might 
offend some narrow-minded parents. 
</p><p>
Mr. Wythe desired me to present you with his most friendly 
regards. He mentioned the difficulty he experiences in using 
his pen as an apology for not giving these assurances himself. 
I postpone my account of the Assembly till I can make it more 
satisfactory, observ.g only that we are at work on the Revisal, and I am not without hopes of seeing it pass this session, 
with as few alterations as could be expected. Some are made 
unavoidable by a change of circumstances. The greatest danger is to be apprehended from the impatience which a certain 
lapse of time always produces.
