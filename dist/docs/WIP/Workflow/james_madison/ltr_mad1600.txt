DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your representation of the politics of the State coincides 
with the information from every other quarter. Great fluctuations and divisions of opinion naturally result in Virginia from 
the causes which you describe, but they are not the less ominous 
on that account. I have, for some time, been persuaded that 
the question on which the proposed Constitution must turn is 
the simple one, whether the Union shall or shall not be continued. There is, in my opinion, no middle ground to be taken. 
The opposition with some has disunion assuredly for its object^' 
and with all for its real tendency. 
</p><p>
Events have demonstrated that no coalition can ever take 
place in favor of a new plan among the adversaries to the proposed one. The grounds of objection among the non-signing 
members of the Convention are by no means the same. The 
disapproving members who were absent, but who have since 
published their objections, differ irreconcileably from each of 
them. The writers against the Constitution are as little agreed 
with one another; and the principles which have been disclosed 
by the several minorities, where the Constitution has not been 
unanimously adopted, are as heterogeneous as can be imagined. 
That of Massachusetts, as far as I can learn, was averse to any 
Government that deserv. the name, and, it is certain, looked 
no farther than to reject the Constitution in toto and return 
home in triumph. The men of abilities, of property, of character, with every judge, lawyer of eminence, and the clergy of 
all sects, were, with scarce an exception deserv.g notice, as 
unanimous in that 'State as the same description of characters 
are divided and opposed to one another in Virginia. This contrast does not arise from circumstances of local interest, but 
from causes which will, in my opinion, produce much regret 
hereafter in the opponents in Virginia, if they should succeed 
in their opposition. 
</p><p>
New Hampshire is now in Convention. It is expected that, 
the result will be in favor of the Constitution. Rhode Island 
takes no notice of the matter. <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> is much divided. 
The weight of abilities and of property is on the side of the 
Constitution. She must go with the Eastern States, let the direction be what it may. By a vessel just from <a href="/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, we 
understand that opposition will be made there. Mr. Lowndes 
is the leader of it. 
</p><p>
A British packet brings a picture of affairs in France which 
indicates some approaching events in that Kingdom, which may 
almost amount to a Revolution in the form of its Government. 
The authority is in itself suspicious; but it coincides with a 
variety of proofs that the spirit of liberty has made a progress 
which must lead to some remarkable conclusion of the scene. 
The Dutch patriots seem to have been the victims, partly of 
their own folly, and partly of something amiss in their friends. 
The present state of that Confederacy is, or ought to be, a very 
/ emphatic lesson to the United States. The want of union and 
a capable Government is the source of all their calamities, and 
particularly of that dependence on foreign powers which is as 
dishonorable to their character as it is destructive of their 
tranquillity.
