HON'D SIR -
</p><p>
After a very tedious discussion, the Constitution has been 
ratified by the Convention of this State. It was carried by a 
majority of 5, the ayes being 30, the noes 25. Amendments, in 
general, similar to those of Virginia, are recommended, and a 
confidence expressed in the act of adoption that they will be 
incorporated in the Constitution. The Convention of North 
Carolina has not been heard from since it met. Congress are 
at present making the arrangements for putting the Government into operation.
