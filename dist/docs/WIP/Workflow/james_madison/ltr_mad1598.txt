DEAR SIR, 
The public here continues to be much agitated by the proposed federal Constitution, and to be attentive to little else. 
At the date of my last, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, had adopted it. It has been since adopted by Connecticut, 
Georgia, and Massachusetts. In the first, the minority consisted of 40 against 127. In Georgia, the adoption was unanimous. In Massachusetts, the conflict was tedious and the event 
extremely doubtful. On the final question the vote stood 187 
against 168, a majority of 19 only being in favor of the Constitution. 
</p><p>
The prevailing party comprized, however, all the men of abilities, of property, and of influence. In the opposite multitude 
there was not a single character capable of uniting their wills 
or directing their measures. It was made up, partly of deputies from the province of Maine, who apprehended difficulties 
from the new Government to their scheme of separation, partly 
of men who had espoused the disaffection of Shay's, and partly 
of ignorant and jealous men, who had been taught, or had fancied, that the Convention at <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> had entered into a 
conspiracy against the liberties of the people at large, in order 
to erect an aristocracy for the rich, the well born, and the men 
of Education. They had no plan whatever. They looked no 
farther than to put a negative on the Constitution and return 
home. The amendments, as recommended by the Convention, 
were, as I am well informed, not so much calculated for the minority in the Convention, on whom they had little effect, as for 
the people of the State. You will find the amendments in the 
newspapers which are sent from the office of foreign affairs. It 
appears, from a variety of circumstances, that disappointment 
had produced no asperity in the minority, and that they will 
probably not only acquiesce in the event, but endeavour to reconcile their constituents to it. This was the public declaration 
of several who were called the leaders of the party. 
</p><p>
The minority of Connecticut behaved with equal moderation. 
That of Pennsylvania has been extremely intemperate, and continues to use a very bold and menacing language. Had the 
decision in Massachusetts been adverse to the Constitution, it 
is not improbable that some very violent measures would have 
followed in that State. The cause of the inflammation, however, is much more in their State factions than in the system 
proposed by the Convention. New Hampshire is now deliberating on the Constitution. It is generally understood that an 
adoption is a matter of certainty. South Carolina and Maryland have fixed on April or May for their Conventions. The 
former, it is currently said, will be one of the ratifying States. 
Mr. Chase, and a few others, will raise a considerable opposition in the latter. But the weight of personal influence is on 
the side of the Constitution, and the present expectation is, 
that the opposition will be outnumbered by a great majority. 
This State is much divided in its sentiments. Its Convention 
is to be held in June. The decision of Massachusetts will give 
the turn in favor of the Constitution, unless an idea should prevail, or the fact should appear, that the voice of the State is 
opposed to the result of its Convention. North Carolina has 
put off her Convention till July. The State is much divided, it 
is said. 
</p><p>
The temper of Virginia, as far as I can learn, has undergone 
but little change of late. At first, there was an enthusiasm for 
the Constitution. The tide next took a sudden and strong turn 
in the opposite direction. The influence and exertions of Mr. 
Henry and Col. Mason, and some others, will account for this. 
Subsequent information again represented the Constitution as 
regaining, in some degree, its lost ground. The people at large 
have been uniformly said to be more friendly to the Constitution than the Assembly. But it is probable that the dispersion 
of the latter will have a considerable influence on the opinions 
of the former. The previous adoption of nine States must have 
a very persuasive effect on the minds of the opposition, though 
I am told that a very bold language is held by <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> and 
some of his partizans. Great stress is laid on the self-sufficiency 
of that State, and the prospect of external props is alluded to. 
</p><p>
Congress have done no business of consequence yet, nor is it 
probable that much more of any sort will precede the event of 
the great question before the public. 
</p><p>
The Assembly of Virginia have passed the district Bill, of 
which I formerly gave you an account. There are 18 districts, 
with 4 new Judges, Mr. Gabriel Jones, Richard Parker, S* 
George Tucker, and Jo 8 . Prentis. They have reduced much the 
taxes, and provided some indulgences for debtors. The question of British debts underwent great vicissitudes. It was, after 
long discussion, resolved by a majority of 30, against the utmost 
exertions of <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>, that they should be paid as soon as the 
other States should have complied with the Treaty. A few days 
afterwards he carried his point by a majority of 50, that Great 
Britain should first comply. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Y'rs affect'.

P. S. Mr. St. John has given me a very interesting description of a " System of Nature," lately published at <a href="/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. Will 
you add it for me ?
