DEAR SIR, I am favored with yours of the 3d instant. Other 
by the same conveyance confirm your report of the election of <a href='/results.php?tla=beh' rel='colleague'>Mr. Harrison</a> to the chief magistracy. Several other 
appointments are mentioned which I make no doubt are all 
well known to you. 
</p><p>
On whichever side <a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Mr. Deane's</a> are viewed, they present mysteries. Whether they be supposed genuine or spurious, 
or a mixture of both, difficulties which cannot well be answered 
may be started. There are, however, passages in some of them 
which can scarcely be imputed to any other hand. But it is 
unnecessary to rely on these publications for the real character 
of the man. There is evidence of his obliquity which has for a 
considerable time been conclusive.

Congress have not resumed their proceedings on the Western 
business. They have agreed on a requisition on the States for 
8,000,000 of dollars, and a completion of their lines according 
to the last establishment of the army. We endeavored, though 
with very little effect, to obtain deductions in the first article 
from the quota of Virginia, but we did not oppose the aggregate 
of the demand in either. If we do not obtain a sufficiency of 
men and money from the States by regular and duly-appointed 
calls, we know by experience that the burden of the war will 
fall on the resources of the States which happen to be the subject of it.

Mr. Moore, late Vice President, has been elected President of 
this State in place of Mr. Reed, whose period of eligibility was 
out. 
</p><p>
I am, dr sir, yours.
