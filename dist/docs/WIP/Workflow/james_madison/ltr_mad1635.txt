</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 2d instant, with theattending it, never came to hand 'til last evening. I have good 
reason to believe that the delay happened between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a> 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, rather than at or from the latter place. 
Mr. F. Maury pays particular attention to allwhich arrive 
there for me, and forwards them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> by opportunities 
which are frequent and safe. I apprehend there will be no impropriety in committing a confidential letter to that channel. 
As an additional precaution, I will desire him to be particularly 
attentive to any letter which may have your name on it. 
</p><p>
I have heard from two only of the 'returns from the Electoral districts;* the one in favor of Mr. Gilchrist, the other of 
General Stevens. He succeeded against Col. Cabell by a majority of 82 votes.f He owes his success to the coalition between the two parties in Spottsylvania. My situation is unfavorable for intelligence from the State at large, and therefore 
I can say little of the prospects as to the February election. 
</p><p>
I fear, from the vague accounts which circulate, that the federal Candidates are likely to stand in the way of each other. 
This is not the case, however, in my district. The field is left 
entirely to Monroe and myself. The event of our competition 
will probably depend on the part to be taken by two or three 
descriptions of people, whose decision is not known, if not yet 
to be ultimately formed. I have pursued my pretensions much 
further than I had premeditated, having not only made great 
use of epistolary means, but actually visited two Counties, Culpeper and Louisa, and publicly contradicted the erroneous reports propagated against me. It has been very industriously 
inculcated that I am dogmatically attached to the Constitution

The unanimity in Amherst was produced by a previous declaration, as I am 
told, of Col. Cabell, on the subject of the president, which satisfied the Federal 
party. Little attention seems to have been paid anywhere to the Vice President. 
Among the bulk of the people, the choice of the President has been regarded as 
the sole subject of the election. 
</p><p>

in every clause, syllable, and letter, and therefore not a single 
amendment will be promoted by my vote, either from conviction or a spirit of accommodation. This is the report most 
likely to affect the election, and most difficult to be combated 
with success within the limited period. There are a number 
of others, however, which are auxiliaries to it. With my respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington, and the others of 
your family, 
</p><p>
I remain, Dear Sir, your mo. obed. and affect. serv.
