DEAR SIR, I have been here too short a time, as yet, to have 
collected fully the politics of the session. In general, appearances are favorable. On the question for a paper emission, the 
measure was this day rejected in emphatical terms by a majority 
of 84 vs. 17. The affair of the Mississippi is but imperfectly 
known. I find that its influence on the federal spirit will not 
be less than was apprehended. The Western members will not 
be long silent on the subject. I inculcate a hope that the views 
of Congress may yet be changed, and that it would be rash to 
suffer the alarm to interfere with the policy of amending the 
Confederacy. The sense of the House has not yet been tried 
on the latter point. 
</p><p>
The Report from the Deputies to <a href="/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a> lies on the table, 
and I hope will be called for before the business of the Mississippi begins to ferment. <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> has signified his wish not 
to be re-elected, [Governor,] but will not be in the Assembly. 
The Attorney [Ed. Randolph] and <a href='/results.php?tla=rhl' rel='co-worker'>R. H. Lee</a> are in nomination for his successor. The former will probably be appointed; 
in which case, the contest for that vacancy will lie between Col. Innes and <a href='/results.php?tla=tom' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Marshall</a>. The nominations for Congress are, 
as usual, numerous. There being no Senate yet, it is uncertain when any of these appointments will take place. 
With sincerest affection, your's.
