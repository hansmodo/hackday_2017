DEAR SIR, The pressure of business as the session approaches 
its term, the earlier hour at which the House of Representatives 
has for some time met, and the necessity of devoting a part of 
the interval to exercise, after so long a confinement, have obliged 
me to deny myself the pleasure of communicating regularly with 
my friends. I regret much that this violation of my wishes has 
unavoidably extended itself to the correspondences on which I 
set the greatest value, and which, I need not add, include yours. 
The regret is the greater, as I fear it will not be in my power 
to atone for past omissions by more punctuality during the residue of the session. In your goodness alone I must consequently 
look for my title to indulgence.

The funding and Revenue systems are reduced by the discord 
of opinions into a very critical state. Out of this extremity, 
however, some effective provision must, I think, still emerge. 
The affair of the State debts has been the great source of delay 
and embarrassment, and, from the zeal and perseverance of its 
patrons, threatens a very unhappy issue to the session, unless 
some scheme of accommodation should be devised. The business of the seat of Government is become a labyrinth, for which 
the votes printed furnish no clue, and which it is impossible in 
a letter to explain to you. We are endeavoring to keep the 
pretensions of the Potowmac in view, and to give to all the circumstances that occur a turn favorable to it. If any arrangement should be made that will answer our wishes, it will be the 
effect of a coincidence of causes as fortuitous as it will be propitious. You will see by the papers inclosed that Great Britain 
is itching for war. I do not see how one can be avoided, unless Spain should be frightened into concessions. The consequences of such an event must have an important relation to the 
affairs of the United States. I had not the pleasure of seeing 
Col. Hoomes during his momentary stay in <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, but had 
that of hearing that he gave a very favorable account of your 
health.
