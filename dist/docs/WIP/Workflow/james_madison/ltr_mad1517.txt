DEAR SIR, I have received your two favors of Nov r 11th 
and December 8th. Along with the former I received the two 
pamphlets on animal magnetism and the last aeronautic expedition, together with the phosphoretic matches. These articles 
were a great treat to my curiosity. As I had left <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> 
before they were brought thither by Col. Le Maire, I had no 
opportunity of attending myself to your wishes with regard to 
him; but I wrote immediately to Mr. Jones, and desired him to 
watch over the necessities of Le Maire. He wrote me for answer that the Executive, though without regular proof of his 
claims, were so well satisfied from circumstances of the justice 
of them, that they had voted him XI 50 for his relief 'till the 
Assembly could take the whole into consideration. This information has made me easy on the subject, though I have not 
withdrawn from the hands of Mr. Jones the provisional resource. 
</p><p>
I thank you much for your attention to my literary wants. 
All the purchases you have made for me are such as I should 
have made for myself with the same opportunities. You will 
oblige me by adding to them the Dictionary, in 13 vol., 4, by 
Felice and others. Also, de Thou, in French. If the utility of 
Moreri be not superseded by some better work, I should be glad 
to have him, too. I am afraid, if I were to attempt a catalogue 
of my wants, I should not only trouble you beyond measure, but 
exceed the limits which other considerations ought to prescribe 
to me. I cannot, however, abridge the commission you were 
so kind as to take on yourself in a former letter, of procuring 
me from time to time such books as may be either "old and 
curious, or new and useful." Under this description will fall 
those particularized in my former, to wit : Treatises on 
the ancient or modern Federal Republics, on the Law of Nations, and the History, natural and political, of the new World; 
to which I will add such of the Greek and Roman authors, 
where they can be got very cheap, as are worth having, and 
are not on the common list of school classics. Other books 
which particularly occur are the translation (French) of the 
historians of the Roman Empire during its decline, by ; 
Pascal's provincial; Don Ulloa in the original; Linnaeus' best edition; Ordonnauces Marines; Collection of Tracts 
in French on the economies of different nations, I forget the full 
title. It is much referred to by Smith on the Wealth of Nations. 
I am told a Mons r Amelot has lately published his travels into 
China, which, if they have any merit, must be very entertaining. 
Of Buffon, I have his original work of 31 vols., 10 vols. of supplement, and 16 vols. on birds. I shall be glad of the continuation as it may from time to time be published.

I am so pleased with the new invented lamp that I shall not 
grudge two guineas for one of them. I have seen a pocket 
compass of somewhat larger diameter than a watch, and which 
may be carried in the same way. It has a spring for stopping 
the vibration of the needle when not in use. One of these would 
be very convenient in case of a ramble into the Western country. In my walks for exercise or amusement objects frequently 
present themselves which it might be matter of curiosity to inspect, but which it is difficult or impossible to approach. A 
portable glass would consequently be a source of many little 
gratifications. I have fancied that such an one might be fitted 
into a case without making it too heavy. On the outside of 
the tube might be engraved a scale of inches, &c. If such a 
project could be executed for a few guineas, I should be willing 
to submit to the price; if not, the best substitute, I suppose, 
will be a pocket telescope, composed of several tubes so constructed as to slide the lesserv.nto the greater. 
</p><p>
I should feel great remorse at troubling you with so many 
requests if your kind and repeated offers did not stifle it in 
some measure. Your proposal for my replacing here advances 
for me without regard to the exchange is liable to no objection, except that it will probably be too unequal in my favour. 
I beg that you will enable me as much as you can to keep these 
little matters balanced. 
</p><p>
The papers from Le Grand were sent, as soon as I got them, 
to Mr. Jones, with a request that he would make the use of 
them which you wished me to do.

Your remarks on the tax on transfers of land in a general 
view appear to me to be just, but there were two circumstances 
which gave a peculiarity to the case in which our law adopted 
it. One was, that the tax will fall much on those who are evading their quotas of other taxes by removing to Georgia and 
Kentucky; the other, that as such transfers are more frequent 
among those who do not remove in the Western than the Eastern part of the Country, it will fall heaviest where direct taxes 
are least collected. With regard to the tax in general on law 
proceedings, it cannot, perhaps, be justified, if tried by the strict 
rule which proportions the quota of every man to his ability; 
time, however, will gradually in some measure equalize it, and 
if it be applied to the support of the Judiciary establishment, 
as was the ultimate view of the periods of the tax, it seems to 
square very well with the Theory of taxation.

The people of Kentucky had lately a Convention, which it 
was expected would be the mother of a separation. I am informed they proceeded no farther than to concert an address to 
the Legislature on some points in which they think the laws 
bear unequally upon them. They will be ripe for that event, at 
least as soon as their interest calls for it. There is no danger 
of a concert between them and the Counties West of the Alleghany, which we mean to retain. If the latter embark in 
a scheme for independence, it will be on their own bottom. 
They are more disunited in every respect from Kentucky than 
from Virginia.

I have not learnt with certainty whether <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> will accept or decline the shares voted him by the Assembly 
in the companies for opening our rivers. If he does not chuse 
to take to himself any benefit from the donation, he has, I think, 
a fine opportunity at once of testifying his disinterested purposes, of shewing his respect for the Assembly, and of rendering a serv.e to his Country. He may accept the gift so far as 
to apply it to the scheme of opening the rivers, and may then 
appropriate the revenue which it is hereafter to produce to some 
patriotic establishment. I lately dropped a hint of this sort to 
one of his friends, and was told that such an idea had been suggested to him. The private subscriptions for Potowmac, I hear, 
amount to XI 0,000 Sterling. I cannot discover that those for 
James River deserv.mention, or that the undertaking is pushed 
with any spirit. If those who are most interested in it let slip 
the present opportunity, their folly will probably be severely 
punished for the want of such another. It is said the undertaking on the Susquehannah by Maryland goes on with great 
spirit and expectations. I have heard nothing of Rumsey or 
his boats since he went into the Northern States. If his machinery for stemming the current operates on the water alone, 
as is given out, may it not supply the great desideratum for 
perfecting the balloons? 
</p><p>
I understand that Chase and Jenifer on the part of Maryland, 
Mason and Henderson on the part of Virginia, have had a meeting on the proposition of Virginia for settling the navigation 
and jurisdiction of Potowmac below the falls, and have agreed 
to report to the two Assemblies the establishment of a concurrent jurisdiction on that river and Chesapeake. The most amicable spirit is said to have governed the negotiation.

The Bill for a general Assessment has produced some fermentation below the mountains, and a violent one beyond them. 
The contest at the next session on this question will be a warm 
and precarious one. The port bill will also undergo a fiery 
trial. I wish the Assize Courts may not partake of the danger. The elections, as far as they have come to my knowledge, 
are likely to produce a great proportion of new members. In 
Albemarle, young Mr. Fry has turned out Mr. Carter. The late 
Governor Harrison, I hear, has been baffled in his own county, 
but meant to be a Candidate in Surry, and in case of a rebuff 
there, to throw another die for the borough of Norfolk. I do 
not know how he construes the doctrine of residence. It is 
surmised that the machinations of Tyler, who fears a rivalship 
for the Chair, are at the bottom of his difficulties. Arthur Lee 
is elected in Prince William. He is said to have paved the way 
by promises to overset the port bill, which is obnoxious to Dumfries, and to prevent the removal of the Assize Court from this 
town to <a href="/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a>. 
</p><p>
I received a letter from the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='acquaintance colleague met'>Marquis Fayette</a>, dated on the 
eve of his embarcation, which has the following paragraph: " I 
have much conferred with the General upon the Potowmac system. Many people think the navigation of the Mississippi is 
not an advantage, but it may be the excess of a very good thing, 
viz: the opening of your rivers. I fancy it has not changed 
your opinion, but beg you will write me on the subject; in the 
meanwhile I hope Congress will act coolly and prudently by 
Spain, who is such a fool that allowances must be made." It 
is unlucky that he should have left America with such an idea 
as to the Mississippi. It may be of the worst consequence, as 
it is not wholly imaginary, the prospect of extending the Commerce of the Atlantic States to the Western waters having 
given birth to it. I cannot believe that many minds are tainted 
with so illiberal and short-sighted a policy. I have thought it 
not amiss to write the Marquis according to the request of his 
letter, and have stated to him the motives and obligations which 
must render the United States inflexible on the subject of the 
Mississippi, the folly of Spain in contesting it, and our expectations from the known influence of France over Spain, and her 
friendly dispositions toward the United States. It is but justice to the <a href="/results.php?tla=laf" rel="acquaintance colleague met">Marquis</a> to observ.that, in all our conversations on 
the Mississippi, he expressed with every mark of sincerity a zeal 
for our claims and a pointed dislike to the National Character 
and policy of Spain; and that if his zeal should be found to 
abate, I should construe it to be the effect of a supposed revolution in the sentiments of America.

This would have been of somewhat earlier date, but I 
postponed it that I might be able to include some information 
relative to your Nephews. My last informed you that your 
eldest was then with Mr. Maury. I was so assured by Mr. 
Underwood, from his neighborhood, who I supposed could not 
be mistaken; I afterwards discovered that he was so, but could 
get no precise information 'till within a few days. One of my 
brothers being called into that part of country by business, I 
wrote to Mrs. Carr, and got him to wait on her. The answer 
with which I have been favored imports that " her eldest son 
was taken last fall with a fever, which, with repeated relapses, 
kept him extremely weak and low 'till about the 1st of January, 
from which time he was detained at home by delays in equipping him for <a href="/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a> 'till the 1st of April, when he set 
out with promises to make up his lost time; that her youngest 
son had also been detained at home by ill health till very lately, 
but that he would certainly go to the academy as soon as a vacation on hand was over; that his time had not been entirely 
lost, as his brother was capable of instructing him whenever his 
health would admit." Mr. Maury's school is said to be very 
flourishing. Mr. Wythe and the other gentlemen of the University have examined it from time to time, and published their 
approbation of its management. I cannot speak with the same 
authority as to the Academy in Prince Edward. The information which I have received has been favorable to it. In the 
recommendation of these seminaries I was much governed by 
the probable permanency of them; nothing being more ruinous 
to education than the frequent interruptions and change of 
masters and methods incident to the private schools of this 
country.

Our winter has been full of vicissitudes, but, on the whole, far 
from being a severe one. The spring has been uncommonly cold 
and wet, and vegetation, of course, very backward, till within a 
few days, during which it has been accelerated by very uncommon heat. A pocket thermometer which stands on the second 
floor and the N. W. side of the house was, on the 24th inst., at 
4 o'clock, at 77; on the 25th, at 78; on the 26th, at 81; to-day, 
the 27th, at 82. The weather during this period has been fair, 
and the wind S; the atmosphere thick N. W.; our wheat in the 
ground is very unpromising throughout the country. The price 
of that article on tide-water is about 6s. Corn sells in this part 
of the country at 10s. and under; below, at 15s.; and where the 
insect prevailed, as high as 20s. It is said to have been raised 
by a demand for exportation. Tobacco is selling on Rappahannock at 32s., and <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> at 37s. Gd. It is generally expected that it will at least get up to 40s. Some of our peaches 
are killed, and most of our cherries ; our apples are as yet safe. 
I cannot say how it is with the fruit in other parts of the country. The mischief to the cherries, &c., was done on the night 
of the 20th, when we had a severe black frost. 
</p><p>
I cannot take my leave of you without making my acknowledgements for the very friendly invitation contained in your 
last. If I should ever visit Europe, I should wish to do it less 
stinted in time than your plan proposes. This crisis, too, would 
be particularly inconvenient, as it would break in upon a 
course of reading which, if I neglect now, I shall probably never 
resume. I have some reason, also, to suspect that crossing the 
sea would be unfriendly to a singular disease of my constitution. The other part of your invitation has the strongest bias 
of my mind on its side, but my situation is as yet too dependent 
on circumstances to permit my embracing it absolutely. It 
gives me great satisfaction to find that you are looking forward 
to the moment which is to restore you to your native country, 
though considerations of a public nature check my wishes that 
such an event may be expedited. 
</p><p>
Present my best respects to <a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='acquaintance co-worker met'>Mr. Short</a> and Miss Patsy, and 
accept of the affectionate regards of, Dear Sir, your sincere 
friend.
