DEAR SIR, Your favor of afforded me much pleasure 
</p><p>
by the information it gave of the return of such flourishing  
health, and has laid me under great obligation by the valuable 
state it enclosed of the great question lately argued in the 
federal court at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>. We are all anxious to learn the 
decision of the Judges, though there is a report that they decline giving their opinions; and were that not so, the importance 
of them is diminished by the probability of an appeal. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the proportion of time which has run off, 
the last hand has been put to a very inconsiderable part of the 
business of the Session. The two Houses have been of late 
chiefly occupied by the Representation bill, which, both in its 
principles and consequences, is of the first importance. The 
House of Representatives, by a very great majority, decided in 
favor of the ratio of 1 for 30,000, as the most obvious intention 
of the Constitution, or at least of the amendment which is 
likely to be made a part of it, as most congenial with the republican character of the Government, and as most correspondent 
with the expectations of the public. In the Senate there were 
three opinions: one favoring the transfer of the fractions from 
the Eastern States, where they happen to fall more than on the 
Southern States; another favoring a small representation in 
the Government; and a third favoring a large representation. 
These opinions being strangely compounded in the same individuals, and divided among the body, produced as strange a 
checker of projects for new-modelling the ratio proposed by 
the other House. After a miscarriage of sundry of them, and 
a delay severely felt at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, they at length, by the 
casting vote of the chair, agreed on a change of the ratio to 1 
for 33,000. To this the House of Representatives disagreed, 
by a bare majority only. The Senate have insisted, and the 
question will probably be to-morrow renewed in the House of 
Representatives. Should they adhere, the Senate will probably 
recede. Should a conference be proposed, the issue will probably be less favorable. The chance may be bettered if Col. Lee 
should arrive in time, who is said to be on the road. But it 
may happen that a vote of concurrence on the part of the House 
of Representatives will cut the business short without a further 
appeal to the temper of the Senate. 
Nothing is yet public with respect to any communications of 
Mr. Hammond with the Executive on the matters in general 
depending between this country and his. We only learn that 
he has authoritatively disavowed any encouragement or countenance from the Government of Canada to Indian hostilities 
against the United States, to which he adds, from analogy and 
his personal conviction, that no such countenance can have been 
afforded to the hostile views of the Creeks attached to Bowles.

Minister of the United States at the Court of Great Britain.

The French revolution seems to have succeeded beyond the 
most sanguine hopes. The King, by freely accepting the Constitution, has baffled the external machinations against it, and 
the peaceable election of a Legislative Assembly of the same 
complexion with their predecessors, and the regular commencement of their functions, have equally suppressed the danger of 
internal confusions. 
</p><p>
With the most affectionate esteem, I remain, dear sir, your 
obt friend and serv.
