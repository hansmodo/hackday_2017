MY DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
It is surmised that the deferred debt is to be taken up at the 
next session, and some anticipated provision made for it. This 
may either be an invention of those who wish to sell, or it may 
be a reality imparted in confidence to the purchaserv. or smelt 
out by their sagacity. I have had a hint that something is intended and has dropt from , which has led to this 
</p><p>
speculation. I am unwilling to credit the fact until I have 
further evidence, which I am in a 'train of getting, if it exists. 
It is said that packet boats and expresses are again sent from 
this place to the Southern States, to buy up the paper of all 
sorts which has risen in the market here. 
</p><p>
These and other abuses make it a problem whether the system of the old paper under a bad Government, or of the new 
under a good one, be chargeable with the greater substantial 
injustice. The true difference seems to be, that by the former 
the few were the victims to the many; by the latter, the many 
to the few. It seems agreed on all hands now, that the bank 
is a certain and gratuitous augmentation of the capitals subscribed, in a proportion of not less than 40 or 50 per cent. ; and 
if the deferred debt should be immediately provided for in favour of the purchaserv.of it in the deferred shape, and since the 
unanimous vote that no change should be made in the funding 
system, my imagination will not attempt to set bounds to the 
daring depravity of the times. The stock-jobbers will become 
the pretorian band of the Government, at once its tool and its 
tyrant; bribed by its largesses, and overawing it by clamours 
and combinations. 
</p><p>
Nothing new from abroad. I shall not be in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
till the close of the week. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Yrs most affectionately.
