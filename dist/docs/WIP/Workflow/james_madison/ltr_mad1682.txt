DEAR SIR, The assumption has been revived, and is still depending. I do not believe it will take place, but the event may 
possibly be governed by circumstances not at present fully in 
view. The funding bill for the proper debt of the United States 
is engrossed for the last reading. It conforms in substance to 
the plan of the Secretary of the Treasury. You will have seen 
by late papers that an experiment for navigation and commercial purposes has been introduced. It has powerful friends, and 
from the present aspect of the House of Representatives will 
succeed there by a great majority. In the Senate its success is 
not improbable, if I am rightly informed. You will see by the 
inclosed paper that a removal from this place has been voted by 
a large majority of our House. The other is pretty nearly balanced. The Senators of the 3 Southern States are disposed to 
couple the permanent with the temporary question. If they do, 
I think it will end in either an abortion of both, or in a decision 
of the former in favour of the Delaware. I have good reason 
to believe that there is no serv.us purpose in the Northern 
States to prefer the Potowmac, and that, if supplied with a pretext for a very hasty decision, they will indulge their secret 
wishes for a permanent establishment on the Delaware. As 
Rhode Island is again in the Union, and will probably be in the 
Senate in a day or two, the Potowmac has the less to hope and 
the more to fear from this quarter. Our friend, Col. Bland, was 
a victim this morning to the influenza, united with the effects 
and remains of previous indisposition. His mind was not right 
for several days before he died. The President has been at the 
point of death, but is recovered. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a> has had a tedious 
spell of the head-ache. It has not latterly been very severe, but 
is still not absolutely removed.
