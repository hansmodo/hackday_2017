DEAR SIR, My former will have made known to you 
the obstacles to a licence for your visit to America. The new 
authority has not yet taken up your application. As soon as 
the auxiliary offices to the President shall be established and 
filled, which will probably not be long delayed, I hope the subject will be decided on, and in the manner you wish. It is already agreed in the form of resolutions that there shall be three 
departments: one for finance, another for foreign affairs, and the 
third for war. The last will be continued in the hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='co-worker'>General Knox</a>. The second will remain with <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jay</a>, if he chooses 
to keep it. The first is also to be under one head, though to be 
branched out in such a manner as will check the administration. 
Chancellor Livingston wishes this department, but will not succeed. It will be given, I think, to Jay or Hamilton. The latter is, perhaps, best qualified for that species of business, and 
on that account would be preferred by those who know him 
personally. The former is more known by character throughout the United States. 
</p><p>
I have been asked whether any appointment at home would 
be agreeable to you. Being unacquainted with your mind, I 
have not ventured on an answer.

The Bill of rates, which passed the House of Representatives 
a few days ago, is not yet come down from the Senate. The 
duties will, it is said, be pretty much reduced. In a few instances, perhaps, the reductions may not be improper. If they 
are not generally left as high as will admit of collection, the 
dilemma will be unavoidable, of either maintaining our public 
credit in its birth, or resorting to other kinds of taxation for 
which our constituents are not yet prepared. The Senate is 
also abolishing the discriminations in favor of nations in Treaty, 
whereby Britain will be quieted in the enjoyment of our trade, 
as she may please to regulate it, and France discouraged from 
her efforts at a competition which it is not less our interest than 
hers to promote. The question was agitated repeatedly in the 
House of Representatives, and decided at last almost unanimously, in favor of some monitory proof that our Government 
is able and not afraid to encounter the restrictions of Britain. 
Both the Senators from Virginia, particularly Lee, go with the 
majority of the Senate. In this, I suspect the temper of the 
party which sent them is as little consulted as in the conduct 
of Lee in the affair of titles, and his opinion in relation to the 
western country.

I have already informed you that Madam Brehan is every 
day recovering from the disesteem and neglect into which reports had thrown her, and that Moustier is also become more 
and more acceptable, or at least less and less otherwise. His 
commercial ideas are probably neither illiberal nor unfriendly 
to this country. The contrary has been supposed. When the 
truth is ascertained and known, unfavorable impressions will be 
still more removed.

The subject of amendments was to have been introduced on 
monday last, but is postponed in order that more urgent business may not be delayed. On monday seven-night it will certainly come forward. A Bill of rights, incorporated, perhaps, 
into the Constitution, will be proposed, with a few alterations 
most called for by the opponents of the Government and least 
objectionable to its friends.

As soon as Mr. Brown arrives, who is the Representative of 
Kentucky, the admission of that district to the character of a 
State, and a member of the Union, will claim attention. I foresee no difficulty, unless local jealousy should couple the pretensions of Vermont with those of Kentucky; and even then no 
other delay than what may be necessary to open the way for 
the former, through the forms and perhaps the objections of this 
State, N. York, which must not be altogether disregarded. 
</p><p>
The proceedings of the new Congress are, so far, marked 
with great moderation and liberality, and will disappoint the 
wishes and predictions of many who have opposed the Government. The spirit which characterizes the House of Representatives, in particular, is already extinguishing the honest fears 
which considered the system as dangerous to Republicanism. 
For myself, I am persuaded that the bias of the federal is on 
the same side with that of the State Governments, though in a 
much less degree.
