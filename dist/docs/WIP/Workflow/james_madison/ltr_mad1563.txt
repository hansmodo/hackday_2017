TO COL. JAMES MADISON. [SR.]

HON'D SlR -

The success of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel=''>General Lincoln</a> against the insurgents has 
corresponded with the hopes of the Government. It is still said, 
notwithstanding, that there remains a great deal of leven in the 
mass of the people. Connecticut has not caught the fermentation, but she pays no taxes. Congress received a letter a few 
days ago from the Governor of that State, inclosing a non-compliance of the Assembly with the requisitions of Congress. In 
fact, payments to the federal Treasury are ceasing everywhere, 
and the minds of people losing all confidence in our political 
system. What change may be wrought by the proposed Convention is uncertain. There is a prospect, at present, of pretty 
general appointments to it.
