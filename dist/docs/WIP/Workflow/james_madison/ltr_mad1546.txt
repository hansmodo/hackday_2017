DEAR SIR, I have twofrom you not yet acknowledged, one of the 1st, the other of the 3d instant. Nothing could 
be more distressing than the issue of the business stated in the 
latter. If the affirmative vote of seven States should be pursued, it will add the insult of trick to the injury of the thing 
itself. 
</p><p>
Our prospect here makes no amends for what is done with 
you. Delaware, New Jersey, and Virginia, alone are on the 
ground; two Commissioners attend from <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and one 
from Pennsylvania. Unless the sudden attendance of a much 
more respectable number takes place it is proposed to break up 
the meeting, with a recommendation of another time and place, 
and an intimation of the expediency of extending the plan to 
other defects of the Confederation. In case of a speedy dispersion, I shall find it requisite to ride back as far as <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> before I proceed to Virginia, from which place, if not from 
this, I will let you know the upshot here. 
</p><p>
I have heard that Col. Gray son was stopped at Trenton, by 
indisposition, on his way to the Assembly of Pennsylvania. I 
hope he is well again, and would write to him, but know not 
whither to address a letter to him. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Yrs aff.
