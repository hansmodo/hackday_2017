DEAR SIR, Since the receipt of your favor of the 15th January, I have had the further pleasure of seeing your valuable 
observations on the Bank more at length, in your communications to Mr. White. The subject has been decided, contrary 
to your opinion, as well my own, by large majorities in both 
Houses, and is now before the President. The power of incorporating cannot, by any process of safe reasoning, be drawn 
within the meaning of the Constitution as an appurtenance of 
any express power, and it is not pretended that it is itself an 
express power. The arguments in favor of the measure rather 
increased my dislike to it, because they were founded on remote 
implications which strike at the very essence of the Government, as composed of limited and enumerated powers. The plan 
is, moreover, liable to a variety of other objections, which you 
have so judiciously developed.

The excise is not yet returned by the Senate. It has undergone sundry alterations in that House, but none that affect its 
principle or will affect its passage. In many respects it is displeasing to me, and a greater evil than a direct tax. But the 
latter would not be listened to in Congress, and would, perhaps, 
be not less offensive to the ears of the people at large, particularly in the Eastern part of the Union. The Bill contains, as 
you would wish, an optional clause, permitting the owners of 
country stills to pay the tax on their capacity, or to keep an 
account of the liquors actually distilled, and pay according to 
that and no more.

The Bill for admitting Kentucky has passed into a law, and 
another for extending the privileges to Vermont, who is knocking at the door for it, has come from the Senate, and will not 
be opposed in the House of Representatives. The Bill for selling the public lands has made some progress, and I hope will 
go through. The fate of the Militia and several other important bills is problematical at the present Session, which will expire on the 4th of next month. 
With the sincerest affection, I am, dear sir, most respectfully 
yours.

The enclosed paper, I observe. has a sketch of some of the 
arguments against the Bank. They are extremely mutilated, 
and in some instances perverted, but will give an idea of the 
turn which the question took.
