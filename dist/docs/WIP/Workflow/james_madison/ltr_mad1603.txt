DEAR SIR, Having seen a part only of the names returned 
for the Convention, and being unacquainted with the political 
characters of many of them, I am a very incompetent prophet 
of the fate of the Constitution. My hopes, however, are much 
encouraged by my present conjectures. Those who have more 
data for their calculations than I have augur a flattering issue 
to the deliberations of June. I find that Col. Nicholas, who is 
among the best judges, thinks, on the whole, that a majority in 
the Convention will be on the list of federalists; but very 
properly takes into view the turn that may be given to the 
event by the weight of Kentucky, if thrown into the wrong 
scale, and by the proceedings of Maryland and South Carolina, 
if they should terminate in either a rejection or postponement 
of the question. The impression on Kentucky, like that on the 
rest of the State, was at first answerable to our wishes; but, as 
elsewhere, the torch of discord has been thrown in, and has 
found the materials but too inflammable. I have written several since my arrival to correspondents in that district, 
with a view to counteract anti-federal machinations. I have 
little expectation, however, that they will have much effect, 
unless the communications that may go from Mr. Brown in 
Congress should happen to breathe the same spirit; and I am 
not without apprehensions that his mind may have taken an 
unlucky tincture from the difficulties thrown in the way of the 
separation of the District, as well as from some antecedent proceedings of Congress. I have taken the liberty of writing, also, 
to a friend in South Carolina, on the critical importance of a 
right decision there to a favorable one here. The enclosed 
letter, which I leave unsealed, will shew you that I am doing 
the same with respect to Maryland. Will you be so good as to 
put a wafer in it, and send it to the post office for <a href="/results.php?city=georgetown" rel="city">GEORGETOWN</a>, 
or to change the address to <a href="/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>, if you should have 
reason to conclude that Mr. Carroll will be there? I have 
written a similar letter to Doctor McHenry. The difference 
between even a postponement and adoption in Maryland may, 
in the nice balance of parties here, possibly give a fatal advantage to that which opposes the Constitution. 
</p><p>
I have done nothing yet in preparing answers to the queries. 
As facts are to be ascertained, as well as opinions formed, delay 
will be of course counted upon. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of respect and attachment, I remain, 
Dear Sir, your ob' and humble serv. .
