DEAR SIR, The Count de Moustier arrived here a few days ago, as successor to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a>. His passage 
has been so tedious that I am not sure that the despatches from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a> make any considerable addition to former intelligence. I have not yet seen them, but am told that this is the 
case. In general, it appears that the affairs of Holland are put 
into a pacific train. The Prussian troops are to be withdrawn, 
and the event settled by negotiations. But it is still possible 
that the war between the Russians and Turks may spread a 
general flame throughout Europe. 
</p><p>
The intelligence from Massachusetts begins to be very ominous to the Constitution. The anti-federal party is reinforced 
</p><p>
by the insurgents, and by the province of Maine, which apprehends greater obstacles to the scheme of a separate government 
from the new system than may be otherwise experienced; and, 
according to the prospect at the date of the last, there 
was very great reason to fear that the voice of that State would 
be in the negative. The operation of such an event on this 
State may easily be foreseen. Its Legislature is now sitting, 
and is much divided. A majority of the Assembly are said to 
be friendly to the merits of the Constitution. A majority of 
the Senators actually convened are opposed to a submission of 
it to a Convention. The arrival of the absent members will 
render the voice of that branch uncertain on the point of a 
Convention. The decision of Massachusetts either way will 
involve the result in this State. The minority in Pennsylvania 
is very restless under their defeat. If they can get an assembly to their wish, they will endeavour to undermine what has 
been done there. If backed by Massachusetts, they will probably be emboldened to make some more rash experiment. The 
information from Georgia continues to be favorable. The little 
we get from South Carolina is of the same complexion. 
</p><p>
If I am not misinformed as to the arrival of some members 
for Congress, a quorum is at length made up. 
</p><p>
With the most perfect esteem and attachment, I remain, dear 
sir, your obt and humble serv.t.
