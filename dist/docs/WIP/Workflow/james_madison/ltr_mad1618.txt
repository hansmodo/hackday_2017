DEAR SIR, My last went via England, in the hands of a Swiss 
gentleman, who had married an American lady, and was returning with her to his own Country. He proposed to take <a href="/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> 
in his way. By that opportunity I inclosed copies of the proceedings of this State on the subject of the Constitution. 
</p><p>
North Carolina was then in Convention, and it was generally 
expected would, in some form or other, have fallen into the general stream. The event has disappointed us. It appears that 
a large majority has decided against the Constitution as it 
stands, and, according to the information here received, has 
made the alterations proposed by Virginia the conditions on 
which alone that State will unite with the others. Whether 
this be the precise state of the case, I cannot say. It seems at 
least certain that she has either rejected the Constitution, or 
annexed conditions precedent to her ratification. It cannot be 
doubted that this bold step is to be ascribed in part to the influence of the minority in Virginia, which lies mostly in the 
Southern part of the State, and to the management of its leader. 
It is in part ascribed, also, by some, to assurances transmitted 
from leading individuals here, that <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> would set the 
example of rejection. 
</p><p>
The event, whatever may have been its cause, with the tendency of the circular letter from the Convention of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, 
has somewhat changed the aspect of things, and has given fresh 
hopes and exertions to those who opposed the Constitution. 
The object with them now will be to effect an early Convention, composed of men who will essentially mutilate the system, 
particularly in the article of taxation, without which, in my 
opinion, the system cannot answer the purposes for which it 
was intended. An early Convention is in every view to be 
dreaded in the present temper of America. A very short period 
of delay would produce the double advantage of diminishing 
the heat and increasing the light of all parties. A trial for 
one year will probably suggest more real amendments than all 
the antecedent speculations of our most sagacious politicians. 
</p><p>
Congress have not yet decided on the arrangements for inaugurating the new Government. The place of its first meeting 
continues to divide the Northern and Southern members, though 
with a few exceptions to these general descriptions of the parties. The departure of Rhode Island, and the refusal of North 
Carolina, in consequence of the late event there, to vote in the 
question, threatens a disagreeable issue to the business, there 
being now an apparent impossibility of obtaining seven States 
for any one place. The three Eastern States and <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, 
reinforced by South Carolina, and as yet by New Jersey, give 
a plurality of votes in favor of this city. The advocates for a 
more central position, however, though less numerous, seemed 
very determined not to yield to what they call a shameful 
partiality to one extremity of the continent. It will be certainly of far more importance under the proposed than the present system that regard should be had to centrality, whether we 
consider the number of members belonging to the Government, 
the diffusive manner in which they will be appointed, or the 
increased resort of individuals having business with the Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary departments.

If the Western Country be taken into view, as it certainly 
ought, the reasoning is still further corroborated. There is 
good ground to believe that a very jealous eye will be kept in 
that quarter on inattention to it, and particularly when involving a seeming advantage to the Eastern States, which have been 
rendered extremely suspicious and obnoxious by the Mississippi 
project. There is even good ground to believe that Spain is 
taking advantage of this disgust in Kentucky, and is actually 
endeavoring to seduce them from the Union, holding out a darling object which will never be obtained by them as part of the 
Union. This is a fact as certain as it is important, but which 
I hint in strict confidence, and with a request that no suspicion 
may be excited of its being known, particularly through the 
channel of me. I have this moment notice that I must send off 
my letter instantly, or lose the conveyance. I must consequently 
defer further communications till another opportunity.

Along with this you will receive a copy of the report you 
desired from Mr. Thomson, and a copy of the Federalist, a publication mentioned in my last.
