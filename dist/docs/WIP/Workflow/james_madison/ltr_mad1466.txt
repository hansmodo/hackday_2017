DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 25th 
ult. yesterday, and am sorry it is not yet in my power to gratify your hopes with any prospect of a successful issue to this 
campaign. The reports of the approach or arrival of a French 
fleet continue to be circulated, and to prove groundless. If any 
foreign operations are undertaken on the continent, it will 
probably be against the Floridas by the Spaniards. A Spanish 
gentleman, who resides in this city, has received information 
from the Governor of Cuba that an armament would pass from 
the Havannah to Pensacola towards the end of last month, and 
that ten or twelve ships of the line, and as many thousand troops, 
would soon be in readiness for an expedition against St. Augustine. It would be much more for the credit of that nation, as 
well as for the common good, if instead of wasting their time 
and resources in these separate and unimportant enterprises, 
they would join heartily with the French in attacking the 
enemy, where success would produce the desired effect.

The enclosed papers contain all the particulars which have 
been received concerning the apostacy and plot of Arnold. A 
variety of his iniquitous jobs prior to this chef d'ceuvre of his 
villainy, carried on under cover of his military authority, have 
been detected among his papers, and involve a number of persons both within and without the enemy's lines. The embarkation lately going on at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and given out to be 
destined for Virginia or Rhode Island, was pretty certainly a 
part of the plot against West Point; although the first representation of it has not yet been officially contradicted. 
</p><p>
With sincere regard, I am, Dr sir, your obt and humble serv.t.
