REV. SIR, I am not a little affected at hearing of your misfortune, but cannot but hope the cure may be so far accomplished as to render your journey not inconvenient. Your kind 
advice and friendly cautions are a favor that shall be always 
gratefully remembered; and I must beg leave to assure you that 
my happiness, which you and your brother so ardently wish for, 
will be greatly augmented by both your enjoyments of the like 
blessing. 
</p><p>
I have been as particular to my father as I thought necessary 
for this time, as I send him an account of the institution, &c., 
&c., and of the college, wrote by Mr. Blair, the gentleman formerly elected President of this place. You will likewise find 
two pamphlets entitled "Britannia's Intercession for John 
Wilkes," &c., which, if you have not seen it, perhaps may divert 
you. 
</p><p>
I am perfectly pleased with my present situation; and the 
prospect before me of three years' confinement, however terrible 
it may sound, has nothing in it, but what will be greatly alleviated by the advantages I hope to derive from it. 
</p><p>
The near approach of examination occasions a surprising application to study on all sides, and I think it very fortunate 
that I entered college immediately after my arrival. Though 
I believe there will not be the least danger of my getting Jta 
Irish hint, as they call it, yet it will make my studies somewhat 
easier. I have by that means read over more than half Horace 
and made myself pretty well acquainted with prosody, both 
which will be almost neglected the two succeeding years. 
</p><p>
The very large packet off for Carolina I am afraid will 
be incommodious to your brother on so long a journey, to whom 
I desire my compliments may be presented; and conclude with 
my earnest request for a continuance of both your friendships, 
and sincere wishes for your recovery, and an agreeable journey 
to your whole company. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your obliged friend and obedient serv.t.
