DEAR SIR, The information which I have by the Eastern 
mail rather increases than removes the anxiety produced by the 
last. I give it to you as I have received it, in the words of <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. King</a>:

"Our Convention proceeds slowly. An apprehension that 
the liberties of the people are in danger, and a distrust of men 
of property or education, have a more powerful effect upon the 
minds of our opponents than any specific objections against the 
Constitution. If the opposition was grounded on any precise 
points, I am persuaded that it might be weakened, if not entirely overcome. But any attempt to remove their fixed and 
violent jealousy seems hitherto to operate as a confirmation of 
that baneful passion. The opponents affirm to each other that 
they have an unalterable majority on their side. The friends 
doubt the strength of their adversaries, but are not entirely 
confident of their own. An event has taken place relative to 
Mr. Gerry, which, without great caution, may throw us into 
confusion. I informed you by the last post on what terms Mr. 
Gerry took a seat in the Convention. Yesterday, in the course 
of Debate on the Construction of the Senate, Mr. G., unasked, 
informed the Convention that he had some information to give 
the Convention on the subject then under discussion. Mr. Dana 
and a number of the most respectable members remarked upon 
the impropriety of Mr. G.'s conduct. Mr. G. rose with a view 
to justify himself. He was immediately prevented by a number 
of objectors. This brought on an irregular conversation whether 
Mr. G. should be heard. The hour of adjournment arrived, and 
the President adjourned the House. Mr. Gerry immediately 
charged Mr. Dana with a design of injuring his reputation by 
partial information, and preventing his having an opportunity 
to communicate important truths to the Convention. This 
charge drew a warm reply from Mr. Dana. The members collected about them, took sides as they were for or against the 
Constitution, and we were in danger of the utmost confusion. 
However, the gentlemen separated, and I suppose to-morrow 
morning will renew the discussion before the Convention. I 
shall be better able to conjecture the final issue by next post." 
</p><p>
There are other of the same date from other gentlemen on the spot, which exhibit rather a more favorable prospect. 
Some of them, I am told, are even flattering. Accounts will 
always vary in such cases, because they must be founded on 
different opportunities of remarking the general complexion, 
where they take no tincture from the opinions or temper of the 
writer. 
</p><p>
I remain, dear Sir, with the most perfect esteem and attachment, your obt serv.
