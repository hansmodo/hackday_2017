MY DEAR FRIEND, I have been favored with yours of the 
19th instant, and thank you for the answer to Mr. S" John's 
enquiries. The apprehensions of Mrs. Randolph give me unfeigned concern, but I indulge strong hopes that they proceed 
from an imaginary cause. There are so many symptoms which 
mimic the cancerous that it would be wrong to suffer appearances to prevail against the favorable chances. At the same 
time, it is impossible to disapprove of the forecast with which 
the occasion inspires you.

Our business here goes on very slowly, though in a spirit of 
moderation and accommodation which is so far flattering. The 
bill for regulating the quantum of duties is not yet come back 
from the Senate. Some alterations will be made, but none that 
affect the substance of the plan, unless it be the abolition of a 
small favor to the Nations in alliance with us. copied from the 
laws of Virginia. One of our Senators, whose ideas on another 
point excite animadversions among his constituents, seems not 
to consult their sentiments on this. I think myself that it is 
impolitic, in every view that can be taken of the subject, to put 
Great Britain at once on the footing of a most favored nation. 
The bill for collecting the duties is now before the House of 
Representatives, and I fear will not be very quickly despatched. 
It has passed through several hands, legal as well as Mercantile, and, notwithstanding, is in a crude state. It might certainly have been put into a better ; though in every step the 
difficulties arising from novelty are severely experienced, and 
are an ample as well as just source of apology. Scarcely a day 
passes without some striking evidence of the delays and perplexities springing merely from the want of precedents. Time 
will be a full remedy for this evil, and will, I am persuaded, 
evince a greater facility in legislating uniformly for all the 
States than has been supposed by some of the best friends of the 
Union.

Among the subjects on the anvil is the arrangement of the 
subordinate Executive departments. A unity in each has been 
resolved on, and an amenability to the President alone, as well 
as to the Senate by way of impeachment. Perhaps it would 
not be very consistent with the Constitution to require the concurrence of the Senate in removals. The Executive power seems 
to be vested in the President alone, except so far as it is qualified by an express association of the Senate in appointments; 
in like manner as the Legislative is vested in Congress, under 
the exception in favour of the President's qualified negative. 
Independently of this consideration, I think it best to give the 
Senate as little agency as possible in Executive matters, and to 
make the President as responsible as possible in them. Were 
the heads of departments dependent on the Senate, a faction in 
this branch might support them against the President, distract 
the Executive department, and obstruct the public business. 
The danger of undue power in the President from such a regulation is not to me formidable. I see and politically feel that 
that will be the weak branch of the Government. With a full 
power of removal, the President will be more likely to spare 
unworthy officers through fear than to displace the meritorious 
through caprice or passion. A disgusted man of influence would 
immediately form a party against the administration, endanger 
his re-election, and at least go into one of the Houses and torment him with opposition.

I cannot close this without a disagreeable recollection of the 
date of my last. I am most negligent towards my best friends 
perhaps, because I have most confidence in their forgiveness. I 
will at least, in future, inclose the newspapers, when I can do 
no more. I never had less time that I could truly call my own 
than at present, of which I hope you will consider my irregular 
correspondence as the fullest proof. 
</p><p>
Very truly and most affec.
