MY DEAR Sm, No nomination has yet been made of a new 
Commander for the Military establishment, nor of any of the 
Brigadiers authorized by the supplemental act lately passed. 
I refer to the Newspapers for the inferior appointments which 
have taken place. It is understood that S* Clair is not to remain in serv.e. A proposition was yesterday made in the 
House of Representatives desiring the President to institute an 
enquiry into the cause of the Western calamities, which, for 
some particular reasons, was deemed improper, and was disagreed to, but another passed for appointing a committee to 
make an enquiry. It ought to have confined the Committee to 
such circumstances and abuses as are proper information for the 
House, and an explanatory resolution to that effect was laid 
on the table, and will probably be taken up to-day.

The Mint Bill sent from the Senate passed the House of Representatives yesterday. It was disliked and voted against by 
some as it stands, because it does not establish any systematic 
proportion of alloy, conforming to the arbitrary one of the last 
and basest edition of the Spanish dollar; but by most, on account 
of the expense, which is estimated at about 30,000 annually, and 
the additional weight of influence it throws into the preponderating scale. In the course of the bill a small circumstance happened worthy of notice, as an index of political biasses. The 
Senate had proposed in the Bill that on one side of the coin 
should be stamped the head of the President for the time being. 
This was attacked in the House of Representatives as a feature 
of Monarchy, and an amendment agreed to substituting an emblematic figure of Liberty; on the return of the Bill to the Senate the amendment was instantly disagreed to, and the Bill sent 
back to the House of Representatives. The question was viewed, 
on account of the rapidity and decision of the Senate, as more 
serv.us than at first. It was agitated with some fervor, and the 
first vote of the house confirmed by a large majority. The Senate perceiving the temper, and afraid of losing the Bill, as well 
as unwilling to appeal in such a controversy to the public criticism, departed from their habitual perseverance, and acceded 
to the alteration proposed.
