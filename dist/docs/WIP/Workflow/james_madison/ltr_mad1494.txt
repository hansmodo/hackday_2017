DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 16th of March came to hand 
a few days before Mazzei called on me. His plan was to have 
proceeded hence directly to <a href="/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>. My conversation led 
him to premise a visit to <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>, from whence he proposed 
to repair to <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, and close his affairs with the Executive. 
Contrary to my expectation he returned hither on Thursday 
last, proposing to continue his circuit through Gloucester, York, 
and <a href="/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a>, recommended by <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>, for obtaining 
from the former members of the Council certain facts relating 
to his appointment, of which the vouchers have been lost. This 
delay, with the expectation of your adjournment, will probably 
prevent his visit to Congress. Your letter gave me the first 
information both of his views towards a Consulate and of his 
enmity towards Franklin; the first was not betrayed to me by 
any conversation either before or after I made known to him 
the determination of Congress to confine such appointments to 
natives of America. 
</p><p>
As to the 2nd, he was unreserv., alleging at the same time 
that the exquisite cunning of the old Fox has so enveloped his 
iniquity, that its reality cannot be proved by those who are 
thoroughly satisfied of it. It is evident, from several circumstances stated by himself, that his enmity has been embittered, 
if not wholly occasioned, by incidents of a personal nature. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> is the only public man whom he thinks favorably 
of, or seems to have associated with, a circumstance which their 
mutual characters may perhaps account for. Notwithstanding 
these sentiments towards Franklin and Adams, his hatred of 
England remains unabated, and does not exceed his partiality 
for France, which, with many other considerations which need 
not be pointed out, persuade me that however dreadful an 
actual visit from him might be to you in a personal view, it 
would not produce the public mischiefs you apprehend from it. 
</p><p>
By his interview with <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>, I learn that the present 
politics of the latter comprehend very friendly views toward 
the confederacy, a wish tempered with much caution for an 
amendment of our own constitution, a patronage of the payment 
of British debts, and of a scheme of general assessment.

The want of both a Thermometer and Barometer had determined me to defer a meteorological diary till I could procure 
these instruments. Since the receipt of your letter, I have 
attended to the other columns. 
</p><p>
I hope the letter which had not reached you at the date of 
your last did not altogether miscarry. On the 16th of March 
I wrote you fully on sundry points. Among others, I suggested 
to your attention the case of the Potowmac, having in my eye 
the river below the head of navigation. It will be well, I 
think, to sound the ideas of Maryland also, as to the upper parts 
of the north branch of it. The policy of <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> will probably thwart, as far as possible, the opening of it; and without 
a very favorable construction of the right of Virginia, and even 
the privilege of using the Maryland Bank, it would seem that 
the necessary works could not be accomplished. 
</p><p>
Will it not be good policy to suspend further Treaties of 
Commerce till measures shall have taken place in America 
which may correct the idea in Europe of impotency in the federal Government in matters of Commerce? Has Virginia been 
seconded by any other State in her proposition for arming 
Congress with power to frustrate the unfriendly regulations of 
Great Britain with regard to her West India islands? It is 
reported here that the late change of her ministers has revived 
the former liberality which seemed to prevail on that subject. 
Is the Impost gaining or losing ground among the States ? Do 
any considerable payments come into the Continental Treasury? 
Does the settlement of the public accounts make any comfortable progress? Has any resolution been taken by Congress 
touching the old Continental currency? Has Maryland foreborne to take any steps in favour of George Town? Can you 
tell me whether any question in the Court of Appeals has yet 
determined whether the war ceased on our coast on the 3d of 
March or the 3d of April? 
</p><p>
The books which I was told were still at the place left by 
Mr. W. Maury had been sent away at the time Mr. L. Grymes 
informed me of them.

Mr. Mazzei tells me that a subterraneous city has been discovered in Siberia, which appears to have been once populous 
and magnificent. Among other curiosities it contains an equestrain statue, around the neck of which was a golden chain 200 
feet in length, so exquisitely wrought that Buffon inferred from 
a specimen of 6 feet, sent him by the Empress of Russia, that 
no artist in <a href="/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> could equal the workmanship. Mr. Mazzei 
saw the specimen in the hands of Buffon, and heard him give 
this opinion of it. He heard read at the same time a letter 
from the Empress to Buffon, in which she desired the present to 
be considered as a tribute to the man to whom Natural History 
was so much indebted. Mr. Faujas de St. Fond thought the 
city was between 72 and 74 N. L.; the son of Buffon, between 
62 and 64. Mr. M., being on the point of departure, had no 
opportunity of ascertaining the fact. If you should have had 
no better account of the discovery, this will not be unacceptable to you, and will lead you to obtain one. 
</p><p>
I propose to set off for <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> towards the end of this 
week. The election in this county was on thursday last. My 
colleague is Mr. Charles Porter. 
</p><p>
I am, your affect 8 friend.
