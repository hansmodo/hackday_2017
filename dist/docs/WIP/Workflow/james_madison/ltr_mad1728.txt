DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 11th came to hand the day 
before yesterday. I am just setting off to Monroe's, and hope 
to prevent the trouble of an express from Monticello with the 
letter referred to in it. I have already acquainted you with 
the immediate object of this visit. I have just received a line 
from him expressing a particular desire to communicate with 
me, and reminding me that he sets off the last of this month for 
the Courts, and of course will be occupied for some days before 
with preparations. This hurries me; and has forced me to 
hurry what will be inclosed herewith, particularly the last N., 
5, which required particular care in the execution. I shall be 
obliged to leave that, and the greater part of the other Nos., to 
be transcribed, sealed up, and forwarded in my absence. It is 
certain, therefore, that many little errors will take place. As 
I cannot let them be detained till I return, I must pray you to 
make such corrections as will not betray your hand. In pointing and erasures, not breaking the sense, there will be no difficulty. I have already requested you to make free with the 
latter. You will find more quotations from the Federalist. 
Dash them out, if you think the most squeamish critic could object to them. In N. 5 I suggest to your attention a long preliminary remark, into which I suffered myself to be led before 
I was aware of the prolixity. As the piece is full long without 
it, it had probably better be lopped off. The propriety of the 
two last paragraphs claims your particular criticism. I would 
not have hazarded them without the prospect of your revisal, 
and, if proper, your erasure. That which regards Spain, &c., 
may contain unsound reasoning, or be too delicate to be touched 
in a newspaper. The propriety of the last, as to the President's 
answers to addresserv. depends on the truth of the fact, of which 
you can judge. I am not sure that I have seen all the answers. 
My last was of the 12th, and covered the two first Nos. of Helvidius. I am assured that it was put into the post office on 
Tuesday evening. It ought, therefore, to have reached you on 
Saturday last. As an opportunity to <a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> may happen before more than the 3 d N. may be transcribed, it is possible that this may be accompanied by that alone.

The drought has been dreadful to the Corn. There has been 
no rain, making any sensible impression, for seven weeks of the 
hottest weather of the hottest year remembered, and at the very 
period critical to that crop. Yesterday afternoon we had a 
small shower, and more seemed to be passing around us. No 
weather, however, can now possibly add 5 per cent, to the prospect. There cannot be more than half crops made generally, 
and much less in many places.
