DEAR SIR -
</p><p>
The business of Congress is as yet merely in embryo. The principal subjects before them are the plans of revenue and the Militia, reported by Hamilton and Knox. That of the latter is 
not yet printed, and being long, is very imperfectly understood. The other has scarcely been long enough from the press to be looked over. It is too voluminous to be sent entire by the mail. 
I will by the next mail commence a transmission in fractions. Being in possession at present of a single copy only, I cannot avail myself of this opportunity for the purpose. You will find 
a sketch of the plan in one of the newspapers herewith inclosed. Nothing has passed, either in Congress or in conversation, from which a conjecture can be formed of the fate of the Report. 
Previous to its being made, the avidity for stock had raised it from a few shillings to eight or ten shillings in the pound, and emissaries are still exploring the interior and distant parts of 
the Union in order to take advantage of the ignorance of holders. Of late, the price is stationary at, or fluctuating between, the sums last mentioned. From this suspence it would seem as 
if doubts were entertained concerning the success of the plan in all its parts. 
</p><p>
I take for granted that you will before the receipt of this have known the ultimate determination of the President on your appointment. All that I am able to say on the subject is, 
that a universal anxiety is expressed for your acceptance, and to repeat my declarations, that such an event will be more conducive to the general good, and perhaps to the very objects 
you have in view in Europe, than your return to your former station.

I do not find that any late information has been received with regard to the Revolution in France. It seems to be still unhappily forced fro struggle with the adventitious evils of public scarcity, in addition to those naturally thrown in its way by 
ancient prejudices and hostile interests. I have a letter from Havre of the 13th Nov'r , which says that wheat was then selling 
at 10 livres per Bushel, and flour at 50 livres per 100 fts., and 
the demand pressing for all kinds of materials for bread. The 
letter adds that a bounty of 2 livres per 100 ft>. marc on wheat, 
and on flour in proportion, &c., &c., was to commence the 1st 
December last, and continue till the 1st of July next, in favour 
of imports from any quarter of the Globe.
