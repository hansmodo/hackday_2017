DEAR SIR, The arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=rhl' rel='co-worker'>R. H. Lee</a> yesterday has made up 
a quorum of the Senate. A quorum in the other house was made on Wednesday last. The ballots will be opened to-day, 
unless an indisposition of Mr. Basset should prevent; which was not probable yesterday afternoon. The notifications of the 
President and vice President will be left to the Senate. Mr. Charles Thomson will be the messenger to the former. 
</p><p>
The papers will have made known that Mr. Muhlenburg was 
the choice of the Representatives for their speaker, and Mr. Beckley for their clerk. The competitor of the former was 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel=''>Mr. Trumbull</a>, who had a respectable vote; of the latter, Mr. S. Stockton, of New Jersey, who, on the first ballot, had the 
same number with Mr. Beckley. A British packet arrived some days ago, but has not brought, as far as I have learned, 
any publicThe other information brought has passed into our Gazettes, and will have reached you through that channel. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, with the highest respect and attachment, your 
obed. and very h'ble serv. 
</p><p>
Your favor, enclosing a letter received at Mount Vernon for 
me, has been duly received.
