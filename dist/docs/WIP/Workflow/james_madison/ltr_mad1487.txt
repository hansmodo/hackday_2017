HON' Sir-
</p><p>
I readily suppose, from the reports prevalent here, that some 
information on the subject of peace will be expected, and I wish 
it were in my power to gratify you. The truth is, we are in 
nearly as great uncertainty here as you can be. Every day, 
almost, brings forth some fresh rumor, but it is so mingled with 
mercantile speculations that little faith is excited. The most 
favorable evidence on the side of peace seems to be a material 
fall in the price of imported goods; which, considering the 
sagacity and good intelligence of merchants, is a circumstance 
by no means to be despised. A little time will probably decide 
in the case, when I shall follow this with something more satisfactory. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, I remain your affectionate son.
