DEAR SIR, I acknowledge with much pleasure your favor 
of the 6th instant. The "balmy" nature of the Resolutions 
concerning the Mississippi will, I hope, have the effect you 
suggest; though the wounds given to some, and the pretexts 
given to others, by the proceedings which rendered them necessary, will not, I fear, be radically removed. The light in which 
the temporary seat of the new Government is viewed and 
represented by those who were governed by antecedent jealousies 
of this end of the Union is a natural one, and the apprehension 
of it was among the most persuasive reasons with me for contending, with some earnestness, for a less eccentric position. A 
certain degree of impartiality, or the appearance of it, is necessary in the most despotic Governments. In republics this may 
be considered as the vital principle of the administration. And 
in a federal Republic, founded on local distinctions, involving 
local jealousies, it ought to be attended to with a still more 
scrupulous exactness.

I am glad to find you concurring in the requisite expedients 
for preventing anti-federal elections and a premature Convention. The circular letter from this State has united and animated the efforts on the adverse side with respect to both these 
points. An early Convention threatens discord and mischief. 
It will be composed of the most heterogeneous characters; will 
be actuated by the party spirit reigning among their constituents; will comprehend men having insidious designs against the 
Union; and can scarcely, therefore, terminate in harmony or 
the public good. Let the enemies to the system wait until some 
experience shall have taken place, and the business will be 
conducted with more light, as well as with less heat. In the 
mean time, the other mode of amendments may safely be employed to quiet the fears of many, by supplying those further 
guards for private rights which can do no harm to the system, 
in the judgment even of its most partial friends, and will even 
be approved by others who have steadily supported it.

It appears from late foreign intelligence that war is likely 
to spread its flames still farther among the unfortunate inhabitants of the old world. France is certainly enough occupied 
already with her internal fermentations. At present the struggle 
is merely between the Aristocracy and the Monarchy. The only 
chance in favor of the people lies in the mutual attempts of the 
competitors to make their side of the question the popular one. 
The late measures of the Court have that tendency. The nobility 
and clergy, who wish to accelerate the States-General, wish at 
the same time to have it formed on the ancient model, established 
on the feudal idea, which excluded the people almost altogether. 
The Court has at length agreed to convene this Assembly in 
May, but is endeavouring to counteract the aristocratic policy, 
by admitting the people to a greater share of representation. 
In both the parties there are some real friends to liberty, who 
will probably take advantage of circumstances to promote their 
object. Of this description, on the anti-court side, is our friend, 
the Marquis. It is not true, I believe, that he is in the Bastile, 
but true that he is in disgrace, as the phrase there is.
