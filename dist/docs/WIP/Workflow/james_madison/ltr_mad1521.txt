DEAR SIR, Your favour of the 30th of May came to hand 
yesterday only, having lain some time in <a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, and 
finally came to <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>, via Albemarle.

I agree perfectly with you in thinking it the interest of this 
country to embrace the first decent opportunity of parting with 
Kentucky, and to refuse with firmness to part with any more 
of our settlements beyond the Alleghany. It seems necessary, 
however, that this first instance of a voluntary dismemberment 
of a State should be conducted in such a manner as to form a 
salutary precedent. As it is an event which will indirectly 
affect the whole Confederacy, Congress ought clearly to be 
made a party to it, either immediately, or by a proviso that the 
partition act shall not take effect till the actual admission of 
the new State into the Union. No interval whatever should be 
suffered between the release of our hold on that Country and 
its taking on itself the obligations of a member of the federal 
body. Should it be made a separate State without this precaution, it might possibly be tempted to remain so, as well with 
regard to the U. S. as to Virginia, by two considerations: 1. 
The evasion of its share of the general debt. 2. The allurement which an exemption from taxes would prove to the citizens 
of States groaning under them. It is very possible that such a 
policy might in the end prove a disadvantageous one, but the 
charms of ambition, and, at present, interest, too, often prevail 
against the cool remonstrances of true policy. May we not, 
also, with justice, require that a reasonable portion of the particular debt of Virginia should be assumed by that part of Virginia which is to set up for itself?

The arrival of Mr. Gardoqui will turn out, I hope, an auspicious step towards conciliating explanations and overtures with 
regard to the Mississippi. Besides the general motives for expediting an adjustment of this matter, the prodigious effect of 
it on the sale of the back lands makes it of peculiar importance. 
The same consideration presses for such arrangements with G. 
B. as will give us speedy possession of the Western posts. As 
to the commercial arrangements which we wish from her, I own 
my expectations are far from being sanguine. In fact, what 
could she get from us by concessions, which she is unwilling to 
make, which she does not now enjoy? 
</p><p>
I cannot speak with certainty as to all the States, but sure I 
am that the trade of this was never more completely monopolized by her when it was under the direction of her own laws 
than it is at this moment. Our present situation, therefore, 
precisely verifies the doctrine held out in <a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='co-worker'>Deane's</a> intercepted 
The revolution has robbed us of our trade with the 
"West Indies, the only one which yielded us a favorable balance, 
without opening any other channels to compensate for it. What 
makes the British monopoly the more mortifying, is the abuse 
which they make of it. Not only the private planters, who 
have resumed the practice of shipping their own Tobacco, but 
many of the merchants, particularly the natives of the country, 
who have no connections with G. B., have received acc ts of sales 
this season, which carry the most visible and shameful frauds 
in every article. 
</p><p>
In every point of view, indeed, the trade of this country is in 
a deplorable condition. A comparison of current prices here 
with those in the Northern States, either at this time or at any 
time since the peace, will shew that the loss direct on our produce, and indirect on our imports, is not less than fifty per cent. 
Till very lately the price of our staple has been down at 32 and 
33s :>n James River; at 28s. on Rappahannock. During the 
same period, the former was selling in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and I suppose in other Northern ports, at 44s. of this currency, and the 
latter in proportion; though it cannot be denied that Tobacco 
in the Northern ports is intrinsically worth less than it is here, 
being at the same distance from its ultimate market, and burdened with the freight from this to the other States. The price 
of merchandize here is at least as much above as that of Tobacco is below the Northern standard. 
</p><p>
We have had throughout the month of June, and until this 
time, very hot and very wet weather. The effect of it on upland 
corn has been favorable, but much the reverse on that of the 
flats. It has given full opportunity to the planters to pitch 
their crops of Tobacco, but though many of them have repeated 
this operation several times, the grasshoppers and other noxious 
insects have been so uncommonly troublesome that in many 
places the prospect is likely to be much abridged. Should this 
not be the case, the efforts of the country must produce the 
greatest crop that has been seen since the peace. Our Wheat 
in this part of the country is very indifferent. How it may be 
in others I cannot say, but believe the complaints are pretty 
general. 
</p><p>
With the highest esteem and regard, Dear Sir, your obt and 
very humble serv.
