DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
The arrangement which is to carry you to Europe has been made known to me by <a href='/results.php?tla=wis' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Short</a>, who tells me he means to accompany or follow you. With the many reasons which make 
this event agreeable, I cannot but mix some regret that your 
aid towards a revisal of our State Constitution will be removed. 
I hope, however, for your licence to make use of the ideas you 
were so good as to confide to me, so far as they may be necessary to forward the object. Whether any experiment will be 
made this session is uncertain. Several members with whom I 
have casually conversed give me more encouragement than I had 
indulged. As Col. Mason remains in private life, the expediency 
of starting the idea will depend much on the part to be expected 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=rhl' rel='co-worker'>R. H. Lee</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a>. The former is not yet come 
to this place, nor can I determine any thing as to his politics 
on this point. The latter arrived yesterday, and from a short 
conversation I find him strenuous for invigorating the Federal 
Government, though without any precise plan, but have got no 
explanations from him as to our internal Government. The 
general train of his thoughts seemed to suggest favorable expectations. We did not make a house till Wednesday last, and 
have done nothing yet but arrange the committees and receive 
petitions. The former Speaker was re-elected without opposition. If you will, either before or after your leaving America, 
point out the channel of communication with you in Europe, I 
will take the pleasure of supplying you from time to time with 
our internal transactions, as far as they may deserv.your attention; and expect that you will freely command every other 
serv.e during your absence which it may be in my power to 
render. 
</p><p>
Wishing you every success and happiness, I am, dear sir, your 
affec te friend, 
</p>
