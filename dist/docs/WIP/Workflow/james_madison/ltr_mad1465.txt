HONORED SIR, 
</p><p>
The extreme badness of the roads and frequency of rains 
rendered my journey so slow that I did not reach this place till 
Saturday last. The only public intelligence I have to communicate, is that the great and progressive depreciation of the 
paper currency had introduced such disorder and perplexity 
into public affairs, for the present, and threatened to load the 
United States with such an intolerable burden of debt, that 
Congress have thought it expedient to convert the 200,000,000 
of dollars now in circulation into a real debt of 5,000,000, by 
establishing the exchange at 40 for 1 ; and taxes for calling it 
in during the ensuing year are to be payable, at the option of 
the people, in specie or paper, according to that difference. In 
order to carry on public measures in future, money is to be 
emitted under the combined faith of Congress and the several 
States, secured on permanent and specific funds to be provided 
by the latter. This scheme was finally resolved on on Saturday 
last. It has not yet been printed, but will be immediately. I 
shall transmit a copy to you by the first opportunity. The 
little time I have been here makes it impossible for me to enter 
into a particular delineation of it. It will probably create 
great perplexity and complaints in many private transactions. 
Congress have recommended to the States to repeal their 
tender laws, and to take measures for preventing injustice as 
much as possible. It is probable that in the case of loans to 
the public, the state of depreciation at the time they were made 
will be the rule of payment; but nothing is yet decided on that 
point.
