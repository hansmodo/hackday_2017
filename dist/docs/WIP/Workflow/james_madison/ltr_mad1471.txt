DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure of yours of the 2d instant 
yesterday. We have not heard a word of the fleet which lately 
left the Chesapeake. There is little doubt that the whole of it 
has gone to the southward.

Our intelligence from Europe confirms the accession of Portugal to the neutral league, so far at least as to exclude the 
English from the privileges which their vessels of war have 
hitherto enjoyed in her ports. The Ariel, commanded by P. Jones, which had on board the clothing, &c., which has been 
long expected from France, was dismasted a few days after she 
sailed, and obliged to return into port; an event which must 
prolong the sufferings which our army has been exposed to from 
the delay of this supply.

Mr. Sartine, the Minister of the French Marine, has been 
lately removed from the administration of that department. 
His successor is the Marquis de Castries, who is held out to us 
as a man of greater activity, and from whom we may hope for 
more effectual co-operation.

An Irish paper informs us that Mr. Laurens was committed 
to the Tower on the 6th of October, by the three Secretaries of 
State, on suspicion of high treason. As the warrant, with the 
names of the Secretaries subscribed, (with some other particulars,) is inserv.d, no hope remains of the fact being a forgery.

With very sincere regard, I am, Dr sir, your obt serv.
