MY DEAR FRIEND, This is the first convenient opportunity 
I have had for dropping you a line since I last came into the 
State. Your sanction to my remaining in <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> during 
the crisis of the elections, conveyed through Col. Carrington, 
never came to hand till I had arrived in <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>. It coincided 
BO fully with my inclination, and, indeed, with my judgment, that 
had it been received in due time, I do not know but I should 
have disregarded all the pressing exhortations which stood opposed to your opinion. I am persuaded, however, that my appearance in the district was more necessary to my election than 
you then calculated. In truth, it has been evinced by the experiment that my absence would have left a room for the calumnies of anti-federal partizans, which would have defeated 
much better pretensions than mine. In Culpeper, which was 
the critical County, a continued attention was necessary to repel the multiplied falsehoods which circulated. Whether I 
ought to be satisfied or displeased with my success, I shall hereafter be more able to judge. My present anticipations are not 
flattering. I see on the lists of Representatives a very scanty 
proportion who will share in the drudgery of business. And I 
foresee contentions, first between federal and anti-federal parties, and then between Northern and Southern parties, which 
give additional disagreeableness to the prospect. Should the 
State Elections give an anti-federal colour to the Legislatures, 
which, from causes not anti-federal in the people, may well happen, difficulties will again start up in this quarter, which may 
have a still more serv.us aspect on the Congressional proceedings. 
</p><p>
In my last, or one of my last, was enclosed a quere 
from Mr. St. John, the French Consul at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, relating 
to the law here which regulates the recording of deeds, &c. As 
I shall on my return be applied to for an answer, I will thank 
you for the proper one as soon as your leisure will allow. 
</p><p>
I shall go on from this to-morrow. On my arrival I shall 
attend as far as I can to whatever may deserv. your perusal. 
Besides the private satisfaction which I shall have in the continuance of our correspondence, I promise myself the benefit of 
your suggestions on public subjects. 
</p><p>
Present me respectfully to Mrs. R., and rely on the affection 
with which I remain, yours truly. 
</p><p>
As your neighborhood gives you frequent interviews with the President of William and Mary, remind him of my best regards to him.
