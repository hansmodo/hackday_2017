DEAR SIR, My last, dated from this place on the 15th ultimo, 
informed you of my projected trip to Fort Schuyler. I am this 
moment arrived so far on my return to Virginia. My past delay requires so much hurry now, that I can only drop a few 
lines for the packet which is to sail on the 15th instant. The 
Marquis and myself were overtaken at Albany by Mr. de Marbois, on the same errand with ourselves. We reached Fort 
Schuyler on the 29th, and on the next day paid a visit to the 
Oneida Nation, 18 miles distant. The Commissioners did not 
get up till the Saturday following. We found a small portion 
only of the six nations assembled; nor was the number much 
increased when we quitted the scene of business. Accounts, 
however, had come of deputies from more distant tribes being 
on the way. The Marquis was received by the Indians with 
equal proofs of attachment as have been shewn him elsewhere 
in America. This personal attachment, with their supposed 
predilection for his nation, and the reports propagated among 
them that the Alliance between France and the United States 
was transient only, led him, with the sanction of the Commissioners, to deliver a Speech to the Indian Chiefs, coinciding with 
the object of the Treaty. The answers were very favorable in 
their general tenor. Copies of both will be sent to Mons. de Vergennes and the M. de Castries, by Mr. Marbois, and be 
within the reach of your curiosity. The originals were so much 
appropriated to this use during my stay with the Marquis, that 
I had no opportunity of providing copies for you. 
</p><p>
What the upshot of the Treaty will be is uncertain. The 
possession of the posts of Niagara, &c., by the British is a very 
inauspicious circumstance. Another is, that we are not likely 
to make a figure otherwise that will impress a high idea of our 
power or opulence. These obstacles will be rendered much 
more embarrassing by the instructions to the Commissioners, 
which, I am told, leave no space for negociation or concession, 
and will consequently oblige them, in case of refusal in the Indians to yield the ultimate hopes of Congress, to break up the 
Treaty. But what will be the consequence of such an emergency? Can they grant a peace without cessions of territory; or 
if they do, must not some other price hereafter purchase them ? 
A Truce has never, I believe, been introduced with the Savages, 
nor do I suppose that any provision has been made by Congress 
for such a contingency. 
</p><p>
The perseverance of the British in retaining the posts produces various conjectures. Some suppose it is meant to enforce 
a fufilment of the Treaty of peace on our part. This interpretation is said to have been thrown out on the other side. Others, 
that it is a salve for the wound given the Savages, who are 
made to believe that the posts will not be given up till good 
terms shall be granted them by Congress. Others, that it is 
the effect merely of omission in the British Government to send 
orders. Others, that it is meant to fix the fur trade in the 
British channel, and it is even said that the Government of 
Canada has a personal interest in securing a monopoly of at 
least the crop of this season. I am informed by a person just 
from Michilimackinac that this will be greater than it has been 
for several seasons past, or perhaps any preceding season, and 
that no part of it is allowed by the British Commanders to be 
brought through the United States. From the same quarter I 
learn that the posts have been lately well provisioned for the 
winter, and that reliefs, if not reinforcements, of the garrisons 
will take place. Col. Monroe had passed Oswego when last 
heard of, and was likely to execute his plan. If I have time 
and opportunity I will write again from <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, for 
which I set out immediately; if not, from <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>. The Marquis proceeded from Albany to <a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, from whence he will go, 
via Rhode Island, to Virginia, and be at the Assembly. Thence 
he returns into the Northern States to embark for Europe.
