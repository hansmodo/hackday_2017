</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Yours of the 18th ultimo came to hand yesterday. The view which it gives of the operations of the Cabinet 
portends, I fear, a revival of those intrigues and contests of 
ambition which have more than once distracted and dishonoured 
the National Councils. Foreign appointments have generally 
been the parents of those mischiefs, and ought for that reason, 
when no other reasons oppose, to be rendered as unfrequent as 
may be. 
</p><p>
The union between <a href='/results.php?tla=rhl' rel='co-worker'>R. H. Lee</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=rol' rel='colleague'>R. R. Livingston</a> would 
have been among the last of my predictions, nor can I fathom 
the principle on which it is founded. 
</p><p>
The policy of healing the variance between the United States 
and Great Britain is no doubt obvious; but I cannot enter into 
the suspicions entertained of hostile designs in the latter. Her 
internal situation renders them extremely improbable, and the 
affairs of Ireland, as I conceive, absolutely incredible. What 
could she hope for or aim at ? If the late war was folly, a new 
one for the same object would be downright phrensy. Her illhumour is the natural consequence of disappointed and disarmed 
ambition, and her disregard of the Treaty may, if not be justified, at least be accounted for by what has passed in the United 
States. Let both parties do what neither can deny its obligation to do, and the difficulty is at an end. 
</p><p>
The contest with Spain has a more dangerous root. Not 
only the supposed interests, but the supposed rights of the parties are in direct opposition. I hope, however, that both parties will ponder the consequences before they suffer amicable 
negociation to become abortive. The use of the Mississippi is 
given by nature to our Western Country, and no power on 
Earth can take it from them. Whilst we asserv.our title to it, 
therefore, with a becoming firmness, let us not forget that we 
cannot ultimately be deprived of it, and that, for the present, 
war is more than all things to be deprecated. Let us weigh 
well, also, the object and the price, not forgetting that the Atlantic States, <fec., <fec I join in your wish that we had a 
better Cypher, but <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> yields as few resources for amending ours as Trenton. I have not leisure myself, and can command the assistance of no other person. 
</p><p>
[Here the writer gives the same detail of the circumstances which prevented 
the passage of the Bill respecting British debts as is contained in his letter of the 
following day to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a>.] 
</p><p>
It was unlucky that one of the two Bills thus lost should be 
that which will be most likely to involve our public character. 
Before this accident, we had passed the Bill for opening the 
Potomac and a similar one for James River, together with a 
third, presenting to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>Gen Washington</a> a handsome portion of 
shares in each of the companies, and had taken some other 
measures for opening the commercial channel to the Western 
Waters. As I shall not be in <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> to receive any
which may be written hereafter, you will be so good as to address your future favors to <a href="/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>. 
I am, dear sir, with sincerity, your friend and serv.t. 
</p>
