DEAR SIR, I have written a number of to you since 
my return here, and shall add this by another casual opportunity just notified to me by Mr. St. John. Your favor of July 
31 came to hand the day before yesterday. The pamphlets of 
the Marquis Condorcet and Mr. Dupont, referred to in it, have 
also been received. Your other enclosed to the Delegation have been and will be disposed of as you wish, particularly 
those to Col. Eppes and Mr. Lewis. 
</p><p>
Nothing has been done on the subject of the 445 outfit, 1357, 
there not having been a Congress of nine States for some time, 
nor even of seven for the last week. It is pretty certain that 
there will not again be a quorum of either number within the 
present year, and by no means certain that there will be one at 
all under the old Confederation. The Committee, finding that 
nothing could be done, have neglected to make a report as yet. 
I have spoken with a member of it in order to get one made, 
that the case may fall, of course, and in a favorable shape, 
within the attention of the new Government. The fear of a 
precedent will probably lead to an allowance for a limited time 
of the salary, as enjoyed originally by foreign ministers, in preference to a separate allowance for outfit. One of the members 
of the Treasury board, who ought, if certain facts have not escaped his memory, to witness the reasonableness of your calculations, takes occasion, I find, to impress a contrary idea. Fortunately, his influence will not be a very formidable obstacle to 
right. 
</p><p>
The States which have adopted the New Constitution are all 
proceeding to the arrangements for putting it into action in 
March next. Penn a alone has as yet actually appointed Deputies, and that only for the Senate. My last mentioned that 
these were Mr. R. Morris and a Mr. McClay. How the other 
elections there and elsewhere will run is matter of uncertainty. 
The Presidency alone unites the conjectures of the public. The 
Vice President is not at all marked out by the general voice. 
As the President will be from a Southern State, it falls almost 
of course for the other part of the Continent to supply the next 
in rank. South Carolina may, however, think of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague'>Mr. Rutledge</a>, 
unless it should be previously discovered that votes will be 
wasted on him. 
</p><p>
The only candidates in the Northern States brought forward 
with their known consent are Hancock and Adams. Between 
these it seems probable the question will lie. Both of them are 
objectionable, and would, I think, be postponed by the general 
suffrage to several others, if they would accept the place. Hancock is weak, ambitious, a courtier of popularity, given to low 
intrigue, and lately reunited by a factious friendship with S. 
Adams. J. Adams has made himself obnoxious to many, particularly in the Southern States, by the political principles 
avowed in his book. Others, recollecting his cabal during the 
war against <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>, knowing his extravagant 
self-importance, and considering his preference of an unprofitable dignity to some place of emolument better adapted to his 
private fortune as a proof of his having an eye to the Presidency, conclude that he would not be a very cordial second to 
the General, and that an impatient ambition might even intrigue 
for a premature advancement. The danger would be the greater 
if factious characters, as may be the case, should get into the 
public councils. Adams, it appears, is not unaware of some of 
the obstacles to his wish, and through a letter to Smith has 
thrown out popular sentiments as to the proposed President. 
</p><p>
The little pamphlet herewith inclosed will give you a collective view of the alterations which have been proposed by the 
State Conventions for the new Constitution. Various and numerous as they appear, they certainly omit many of the true 
grounds of opposition. The articles relating to Treaties, to 
paper money, and to contracts, created more enemies than all 
the errors in the system, positive and negative, put together. 
</p><p>
It is true, nevertheless, that not a few, particularly in Virginia, have contended for the proposed alterations from the 
most honorable and patriotic motives; and that among the advocates for the Constitution there are some who wish for further guards to public liberty and individual rights. As far as 
these may consist of a constitutional declaration of the most 
essential rights, it is probable they will be added; though there 
are many who think such addition unnecessary, and not a few 
who think it misplaced in such a Constitution. There is scarce 
any point on which the party in opposition is so much divided 
as to its importance and its propriety. My own opinion has 
always been in favor of a bill of rights, provided it be so framed 
as not to imply powers not meant to be included in the enumeration. At the same time, I have never thought the omission a 
material defect, nor been anxious to supply it even by subsequent amendment, for any other reason than that it is anxiously 
desired by others. I have favored it because I supposed it might 
be of use, and, if properly executed, could not be of disserv.e. 
</p><p>
I have not viewed it in an important light 1. Because I conceive that in a certain degree, though not in the extent argued 
by Mr. Wilson, the rights in question are reserv. by the manner in which the federal powers are granted. 2. Because there 
is great reason to fear that a positive declaration of some of 
the most essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite 
latitude. I am sure that the rights of conscience in particular, 
if submitted to public definition, would be narrowed much more 
than they are likely ever to be by an assumed power. One of 
the objections in New England was, that the Constitution, by 
prohibiting religious tests, opened a door for Jews, Turks, and 
infidels. 3. Because the limited powers of the federal Government, and the jealousy of the subordinate Governments, afford 
a security which has not existed in the case of the State Governments, and exists in no other. 4. Because experience proves 
the inefficacy of a bill of rights on those occasions when its 
controul is most needed. Repeated violations of these parchment barriers have been committed by overbearing majorities 
in every State. 
</p><p>
In Virginia, I have seen the bill of rights violated in every 
instance where it has been opposed to a popular current. Notwithstanding the explicit provision contained in that instrument for the rights of conscience, it is well known that a religious establishment would have taken place in that State, if the 
Legislative majority had found, as they expected, a majority of 
the people in favor of the measure; and I am persuaded that if 
a majority of the people were now of one sect, the measure would 
still take place, and on narrower ground than was then proposed, 
notwithstanding the additional obstacle which the law* has 
since created. 
</p><p>
Wherever the real power in a Government lies, there is the 
danger of oppression. In our Governments the real power lies 
in the majority of the community, and the invasion of private 
rights is chiefly to be apprehended, not from acts of Government 
contrary to the sense of its constituents, but from acts in which 
the Government is the mere instrument of the major number of 
the Constituents. This is a truth of great importance, but not 
yet sufficiently attended to; and is probably more strongly impressed on my mind by facts and reflections suggested by them 
than on yours, which has contemplated abuses of power issuing 
from a very different quarter. Wherever there is an interest 
and power to do wrong, wrong will generally be done, and not 
less readily by a powerful and interested party than by a powerful and interested prince. The difference, so far as it relates 
to the superiority of republics over monarchies, lies in the less 
degree of probability that interest may prompt abuses of power 
in the former than in the latter; and in the security in the 
former against an oppression of more than the smaller part of 
the Society, whereas, in the latter, it may be extended in a manner to the whole. 
</p><p>
The difference, so far as it relates to the point in question 
the efficacy of a bill of rights in controuling abuses of power 
lies in this: that in a monarchy the latent force of the nation is 
superior to that of the Sovereign, and a solemn charter of popular rights must have a great effect as a standard for trying 
the validity of public acts, and a signal for rousing and uniting 
the superior force of the community; whereas, in a popular Government, the political and physical power may be considered as 
vested in the same hands, that is, in a majority of the people, 
and, consequently, the tyrannical will of the Sovereign is not 
to be controuled by the dread of an appeal to any other force 
within the community. 
</p><p>
What use, then, it may be asked, can a bill of rights serv.in 
popular Governments? I answer, the two following, which, 
though less essential than in other Governments, sufficiently 
recommend the precaution: 1. The political truths declared in 
that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with the National sentiment, counteract the impulses 
of interest and passion. 2. Although it be generally true, as 
above stated, that the danger of oppression lies in the interested 
majorities of the people rather than in usurped acts of the Government, yet there may be occasions on which the evil may 
spring from the latter source; and on such, a bill of rights will 
be a good ground for an appeal to the sense of the community. 
Perhaps, too, there may be a certain degree of danger that a 
succession of artful and ambitious rulers may, by gradual and 
well-timed advances, finally erect an independent Government 
on the subversion of liberty. Should this danger exist at all, 
it is prudent to guard against it, especially when the precaution 
can do no injury. 
</p><p>
At the same time, I must own that I see no tendency in our 
Governments to danger on that side. It has been remarked 
that there is a tendency in all Governments to an augmentation 
of power at the expence of liberty. But the remark, as usually 
understood, does not appear to me well founded. Power, when 
it has attained a certain degree of energy and independence, 
goes on generally to further degrees. But when below that degree, the direct tendency is to further degrees of relaxation, until the abuses of liberty beget a sudden transition to an undue 
degree of power. With this explanation the remark may be 
true; and in the latter sense only is it, in my opinion, applicable to the existing Governments in America. It is a melancholy reflection that liberty should be equally exposed to danger whether the Government have too much or too little power, 
and that the line which divides these extremes should be so inaccurately defined by experience. 
</p><p>
Supposing a bill of rights to be proper, the articles which 
ought to compose it admit of much discussion. I am inclined 
to think that absolute restrictions in cases that are doubtful, or 
where emergencies may overrule them, ought to be avoided. 
The restrictions, however strongly marked on paper, will never 
be regarded when opposed to the decided sense of the public; 
and after repeated violations, in extraordinary cases will lose 
even their ordinary efficacy. Should a Rebellion or insurrection alarm the people as well as the Government, and a suspension of the Habeas Corpus be dictated by the alarm, no written 
prohibitions on earth would prevent the measure. Should an 
army in time of peace be gradually established in our neighborhood by Britain or Spain, declarations on paper would have as 
little effect in preventing a standing force for the public safety. 
The best security against these evils is to remove the pretext 
for them. 
</p><p>
With regard to monopolies, they are justly classed among the 
greatest nuisances in Government. But is it clear that, as encouragements to literary works and ingenious discoveries, they 
are not too valuable to be wholly renounced? Would it not 
suffice to reserv.in all cases a right to the public to abolish the 
privilege, at a price to be specified in the grant of it? Is there 
not, also, infinitely less danger of this abuse in our Governments than in most others? Monopolies are sacrifices of the 
many to the few. Where the power is in the few, it is natural 
for them to sacrifice the many to their own partialities and corruptions. Where the power, as with us, is in the many, not in 
the few, the danger cannot be very great that the few will be 
thus favored. It is much more to be dreaded that the few will 
be unnecessarily sacrificed to the many.

I enclose a paper containing the late proceedings in Kentucky. I wish the ensuing Convention may take no step injurious to the character of the District, and favorable to the views 
of those who wish ill to the United States. One of my late letters communicated some circumstances which will not fail to 
occur on perusing the objects of the proposed Convention in 
next month. Perhaps, however, there may be less connection 
between the two cases than at first one is ready to conjecture. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, with the sincerest esteem and affection, yours.
