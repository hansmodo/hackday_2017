TO MR. MURRAY. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, January, 18, <a href="/results.php?year=1797">1797</a>.- 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, <a href='/results.php?tla=gem' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Mason</a> and myself 
lately received your packets of <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> papers by the " Alexander Hamilton," which 
were very acceptable, as they brought us 
the earliest accounts of some of the important articles contained in them. I send 
in return several packets by Captain Joseph Prince, who is to sail from <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, 
and to whom I cannot conveniently transmit anything of a more bulky nature. 
Captain Prince is a brother-in-law of Mr. Beckley, clerk of the House of Representatives, and formerly known to you in Virginia. He will be very sensible to any 
kindness it may be in your power to show his friend ; and they will have a proper claim on his acknowledgments also. 
</p><p>
This country is extremely agitated by pecuniary distresses, and the mercantile 
troubles which begin to thicken. The unfortunate Treaty intended to appease the 
nation is bringing us into trouble with several. You will see that the House of 
Representatives is engaged on the question of a direct tax. The result is a problem not yet to be solved. It is expected 
that the Executive will communicate in a few days a full statement of the controversy with France. 
</p><p>
After a warm contest for the succession 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>, the vacancy will be filled by <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>. He has seventy-one votes, and <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a> only sixty-eight. The division would be more, but 
for the failure of one of the returns from 
a county in this State in time to be counted, and other casualties in other States 
had a share in favoring <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, it is now well known, will serve in the secondary place allotted to him. 
</p><p>
This being the last session of Congress of which I shall be a member, I must, at 
the same time that I return you thanks for all your past favors, request that your 
future ones be addressed to Orange County, Virginia, and that they may not be sent on the calculation that I shall get them free of postage. 
</p><p>
With great esteem, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=mad" rel="me">JAMES MADISON</a>, JR.
