I have received, my dear sir, your agreeable letter, which lingered a long time on the way. 
</p><p>
We congratulate you much on the various successes of your western career, and 
the first thing that strikes us is the rapidity of your promotions. Bounding over 
the preliminary sailorship, the first step on the deck of your bark pardon me, of 
the noble structure the Ark makes you a pilot ; the name of pilot is scarcely pronounced before you are a captain ; and in 
less than the twinkling of an eye the captain starts up a commodore. On the land 
a scene opens out before us in which you, too, figure. We see you at once a plough 
man, a rail-splitter, a fence-builder, a cornplanter, and a hay -maker. To all these 
rural functions, which leave but a single defect in your title of husband-(man), you 
add the facilities of a town life. And to cap the whole you enjoy the official dignity 
of "Register of the Land Office" in the important Territory of Illinois. We repeat 
our congratulations on all these honors and employments, and wish that the emoluments may equal them. 
</p><p>
You are well off, for this year at least, when you can expect bread from corn 
planted in July. Here, famine threatens us in the midst of fields planted in April. 
So severe a drought is not remembered. On some farms, and among them my two 
small ones near home, there has been no rain at all, or none to produce any sensible 
effect. It has been, I hear, particularly hard upon the tobacco crop in Virginia, and will make a bad year. 
</p><p>
You are pursuing, I observe, the true course with your negroes in order to make 
their freedom a fair experiment for their happiness. With the habits of the slave 
and without the instruction, property, or employments of a freeman, the blacks, instead of deriving advantage from the partial benevolence of their masters, furnish 
arguments against the general efforts in their behalf. I wish your philanthropy 
could complete its object by changing their color as well as their legal condition. 
Without this they seem destined to a privation of that moral rank and those social 
blessings which give to freedom more than half its value. <a href="/results.php?tla=dol" rel="spouse met">MRS. MADISON</a> as well as 
myself is much gratified by your promise to devote the next winter to your native 
haunts. We sincerely hope your arrangements will give us an ample share of your 
time. We will then take the case of your bachelorship into serious and full consideration. <a href='/results.php?tla=dol' rel='spouse met'>Mrs. Madison</a> is well disposed to 
give all her aid in getting that old thorn out of your side, and putting a young rib in its place. She very justly remarks, however, that with your own exertions hers 
will not be wanted, and without them not deserved. 
</p><p>
Accept our joint wishes for your health and every other happiness.
