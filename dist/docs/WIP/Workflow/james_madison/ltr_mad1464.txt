HONORED SIR, The assembly have not yet concluded their 
plan for complying with the requisitions from Congress. It 
may be relied on that that cannot be done without very heavy 
taxes on every species of property. Indeed, it is thought questionable whether it will not be found absolutely impossible. 
No exertions, however, ought to be omitted to testify our zeal 
to support Congress in the prosecution of the war. It is also 
proposed to procure a large sum on loan by stipulating to pay 
the interest in tobacco. A tax on this article necessary for 
that purpose is to be collected. Being very imperfectly acquainted with the proceedings of the Assembly on this matter, 
I must refer you for the particulars to the return of Major Moore, or some future opportunity. The law for escheats and 
forfeitures will be repealed as it respects orphans, &c. The 
effects of the measures taken by the Assembly on the credit of 
our money and the prices of things cannot be predicted. If 
our expectations had not been so invariably disappointed, they 
ought to be supposed very considerable. But from the rapid 
progress of depreciation at present, and the universal struggle 
among sellers to bring up prices, I cannot flatter myself with 
the hope of any great reformation. Corn is already at 20, 
and rising. Tobacco is also rising. Pork will probably command any price. Imported goods exceed everything else many 
hundreds per cent.

I am much at a loss how to dispose of Willey. I cannot 
think it would be expedient in the present state of things to 
send him out of the State. From a new arrangement of the 
college here, nothing is in future to be taught but the higher 
and rarer branches of science. The preliminary studies must, 
therefore, be pursued in private schools or academies. If the 
academy at Prince Edward is so far dissolved that you think 
his return thither improper, I would recommend his being put 
under the instruction of Mr. Maury, rather than suffer him to be 
idle at home. The languages, (including English,) geography, 
and arithmetic, ought to be his employment, till he is prepared 
to receive a finish to his education at this place. 
</p><p>
By the late change, also, in the college, the former custom of 
furnishing the table for the president and professors is to be 
discontinued. I am induced by this consideration to renew my 
request for the flour mentioned to you. It will perhaps be the 
only opportunity I may have of requiting received and singular 
favors; and, for the reason just assigned, will be extremely convenient. I wish to know without any loss of time how far this 
supply may be reckoned on. Perhaps Mr. E. Burnley would 
receive and store it for me. 
</p><p>
I am desired by a gentleman here to procure for him two 
bear skins to cover the foot of his chariot. ]f they can be 
bought anywhere in your neighborhood, I beg you or Ambrose 
will take the trouble to inquire for them, and send them to 
Captain Anderson, at Hanover town. If the flour should come 
down, the same opportunity will serv.for them. Captain Anderson may be informed that they are for Mr. Norton. If 
they can be got without too much trouble, I should be glad of 
succeeding, as he will rely on my promise to procure them for 
him. 
</p><p>
Having nothing to add under the head of news, I subscribe 
myself your dutiful son.
