MY DEAR SIR, The period since my last has afforded such 
scanty materials for a letter, that I have postponed it till I have 
now to thank you for yours of the 7th instant, which came to 
hand two days ago. I always feel pleasure in hearing from you, 
but particularly when my concern for your doubtful health is relieved by such an evidence in its favor. At the same time, I 
must repeat my wishes to forego this pleasure whenever it may 
interfere with the attention which you owe to your ease, your 
business, or your other friends. 
</p><p>
I do not learn that any symptoms yet appear of a return of 
the insurgent spirit in Massachusetts. On the contrary, it is 
said that the malcontents are trying their strength in a more 
regular form. This is the crisis of their elections; and if they 
can muster sufficient numbers, their wicked measures are to be 
sheltered under the forms of the Constitution. How far their 
influence may predominate in the current appointments is uncertain; but it is pretty certain that a great change in the rulers of that State is taking place, and that a paper emission, if 
nothing worse, is strongly apprehended. <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='colleague'>Governor Bowdoin</a> 
is already displaced in favor of <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Hancock</a>, whose acknowledged merits are not a little tainted by an obsequiousness to 
popular follies. A great change has also taken place in the 
Senate, and a still greater is prognosticated in the other branch 
of the Legislature. 
</p><p>
We are flattered with the prospect of a pretty full and very 
respectable meeting in next month. All the States have made 
appointments, except Connecticut, Maryland, and Rhode Island. 
The last has refused. Maryland will certainly concur. The 
temper of Connecticut is equivocal. The turn of her elections, 
which are now going on, is said to be rather unpropitious. The 
absence of one or two States, however, will not materially affect 
the deliberations of the Convention. Disagreement in opinion 
among the present is much more likely to embarrass us. The 
nearer the crisis approaches, the more I tremble for the issue. 
The necessity of gaining the concurrence of the Convention in 
some system that will answer the purpose, the subsequent approbation of Congress, and the final sanction of the States, present a serv.s of chances which would inspire despair in any 
case where the alternative was less formidable. The difficulty, 
too, is not a little increased by the necessity which will be produced, by encroachments on the State Constitutions, of obtaining not merely the assent of the Legislatures, but the ratification of the people themselves. Indeed, if such encroachments 
could be avoided, a higher sanction than the Legislative authority would be necessary to render the laws of the Confederacy paramount to the acts of its members. 
</p><p>
I inclose a late act of Congress, which will shew you the light 
in which they view and inculcate a compliance with the Treaty 
of peace. We were not unaware of the bitterness of the pill to 
many of our countrymen, but national considerations overruled 
that objection. An investigation of the subject had proved that 
the violations on our part were not only most numerous and 
important, but were of earliest date. And the assurances on 
the other part are explicit, that a reparation of our wrongful 
measures shall be followed by an immediate and faithful execution of the Treaty by Great Britain. 
</p><p>
Congress are at present deliberating on the most proper plan 
for disposing of the Western land's, and providing a criminal 
and civil administration for the Western settlements beyond 
the Ohio. The latter subject involves great difficulties. On 
the former, also, opinions are various. Between 6 and 700,000 
acres have been surveyed in Townships, and are to be sold as 
soon as they shall be duly advertised. The sale was at first to 
have been distributed throughout the States. This plan is now 
exchanged for the opposite extreme. The sale is to be made 
where Congress sit. Unquestionably, reference ought to have 
been had, in fixing on the place, either to the center of the 
Union or to the proximity of the premises. In providing for 
the unsurveyed lands, the difficulty arises from the Eastern attachment to townships, and the Southern, to indiscriminate 
locations. A copper coinage was agreed on yesterday, to the 
amount of upwards of two hundred thousand dollars; 15 per 
cent, is to be drawn into the federal Treasury from this operation.

Our affair with Spain is on a very delicate footing. It is not 
easy to say what precise steps would be most proper to be taken 
on our side, and extremely difficult to say what will be actually 
taken. Many circumstances threaten an Indian war, but the 
certainty of it is not established. A British officer was lately 
here from Canada, as has been propagated, but not on a mission 
to Congress. His business was unknown, if he had any that 
was important. 
</p><p>
I am extremely concerned, though not much surprised, at the 
danger of a paper emission in Virginia. If <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Henry</a> should 
erect the standard, he will certainly be joined by sufficient force 
to accomplish it. Remorse and shame are but too feeble restraints on interested individuals against unjust measures, and 
are rarely felt at all by interested multitudes.
