DEAR SIR, Your favor of January 9, inclosing one of September last, did not get to hand till a few days ago. The idea 
which the latter evolves is a great one, and suggests many interesting reflections to Legislators, particularly when contracting and providing for public debts. Whether it can be received 
in the extent to which your reasonings carry it is a question 
which I ought to turn more in my thoughts than I have yet 
been able to do before I should be justified in making up a full 
opinion on it. My first thoughts lead me to view the doctrine 
as not in all respects compatible with the course of human affairs. I will endeavour to sketch the grounds of my skepticism. 
"As the Earth belongs to the living, not to the dead, a living 
generation can bind itself only; in every society, the will of the 
majority binds the whole; according to the laws of mortality, 
a majority of those ripe for the exercise of their will do not live 
beyond the term of 19 years; to this term, then, is limited the validity of every act of the society, nor can any act be continued 
beyond this term, without an express declaration of the public 
will." This I understand to be the outline of the argument. 
</p><p>
The acts of a political society may be divided into three 
classes: 
</p><p>
1. The fundamental constitution of the Government. 
</p><p>
2. Laws involving some stipulation which renders them irrevocable at the will of the Legislature. 
</p><p>
3. Laws involving no such irrevocable quality. 
</p><p>
1. However applicable in theory the doctrine may be to a 
Constitution, it seems liable in practice to some weighty objections. 
</p><p>
Would not a Government, ceasing of necessity at the end of 
a given term, unless prolonged by some Constitutional Act previous to its expiration, be too subject to the casualty and consequences of an interregnum ? 
</p><p>
Would not a Government so often revised become too mutable and novel to retain that share of prejudice in its favor 
which is a salutary aid to the most rational Government? 
</p><p>
Would not such a periodical revision engender pernicious 
factions that might not otherwise come into existence, and agitate the public mind more frequently and more violently than 
might be expedient? 
</p><p>
2. In the second class, of acts involving stipulations, must not 
exceptions, at least to the doctrine, be admitted? 
</p><p>
If the earth be the gift of nature to the living, their title can 
extend to the earth in its natural state only. The improvements 
made by the dead form a debt against the living, who take the 
benefit of them. This debt cannot be otherwise discharged 
than by a proportionate obedience to the will of the authors of 
the improvements. 
</p><p>
But a case less liable to be controverted may, perhaps, be 
stated. Debts may be incurred with a direct view to the interests of the unborn, as well as of the living. Such are debts for 
repelling a conquest, the evils of which descend through many 
generations. Debts may even be incurred principally for the 
benefit of posterity. Such, perhaps, is the debt incurred by the 
United States. In these instances the debts might not be dischargeable within the term of 19 years. 
</p><p>
There seems, then, to be some foundation in the nature of 
things, in the relation which one generation bears to another, 
for the descent of obligations from one to another. Equity may 
require it. Mutual good may be promoted by it. And all that 
seems indispensable in stating the account between the dead 
and the living is, to see that the debts against the latter do not 
exceed the advances made by the former. Few of the incumbrances entailed on nations by their predecessors would bear a 
liquidation even on this principle. 
</p><p>
3. Objections to the doctrine, as applied to the third class of 
acts, must be merely practical. But in that view alone they 
appear to be material. 
Unless such temporary laws should be kept in force by acts 
regularly anticipating their expiration, all the rights depending 
on positive laws, that is, most of the rights of property, would 
become absolutely defunct, and the most violent struggles ensue 
between the parties interested in reviving, and those interested 
in reforming, the antecedent state of property. Nor does it 
seem improbable that such an event might be suffered to take 
place. The checks and difficulties opposed to the passage of 
laws, which render the power of repeal inferior to an opportunity to reject, as a security against oppression, would here render the latter an insecure provision against anarchy. Add to 
this, that the very possibility of an event so hazardous to the 
rights of property could not but depreciate its value; that the 
approach of the crisis would increase the effect; that the frequent return of periods superseding all the obligations dependent on antecedent laws and usages must, by weakening the 
sense of them, co-operate with motives to licentiousness already 
too powerful; and that the general uncertainty and vicissitudes 
of such a state of things would, on one side, discourage every 
useful effort of steady industry pursued under the sanction of 
existing laws, and, on the other, give an immediate advantage 
to the more sagacious over the less sagacious part of the Society. 
</p><p>
I can find no relief from such embarrassments but in the received doctrine that a tacit assent may be given to established 
Governments and laws, and that this assent is to be inferred 
from the omission of an express revocation. It seems more 
practicable to remedy by well-constituted Governments the pestilent operation of this doctrine in the unlimited sense in which 
it is at present received, than it is to find a remedy for the evils 
necessarily springing from an unlimited admission of the contrary doctrine. 
</p><p>
Is it not doubtful whether it be possible to exclude wholly 
the idea of an implied or tacit assent, without subverting the 
very foundation of civil society ? 
</p><p>
On what principle is it that the voice of the majority binds 
the minority? It does not result, I conceive, from a law of nature, but from compact founded on utility. A greater proportion might be required by the fundamental Constitution of Society, if under any particular circumstances it were judged eligible. Prior, therefore, to the establishment of this principle, 
unanimity was necessary; and rigid Theory accordingly presupposes the assent of every individual to the rule which subjects the minority to the will of the majority. If this assent 
cannot be given tacitly, or be not implied where no positive 
evidence forbids, no person born in Society could, on attaining 
ripe age, be bound by any acts of the majority, and either a 
unanimous renewal of every law would be necessary as often 
as a new member should be added to the society, or the express 
consent of every new member be obtained to the rule by which 
the majority decides for the whole. 
</p><p>
If these observ.ions be not misapplied, it follows that a limitation of the validity of all acts to the computed life of the 
generation establishing them is in some cases not required by 
theory, and in others not consistent with practice. They are 
not meant, however, to impeach either the utility of the principle as applied to the cases you have particularly in view, or the 
general importance of it in the eye of the philosophical Legislator. On the contrary, it would give me singular pleasure to 
see it first announced to the world in a law of the United States, 
and always kept in view as a salutary restraint on living generations from unjust and unnecessary burdens on their successors. This is a pleasure, however, which I have no hope of enjoying. It is so much easier to descry the little difficulties immediately incident to every great plan than to comprehend its 
general and remote benefits, that further light must be added 
to the Councils of our Country before many truths which are 
seen through the medium of philosophy become visible to the 
naked eye of the ordinary politician.
