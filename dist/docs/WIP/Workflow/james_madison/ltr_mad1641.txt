DEAR SIR, My last was committed in December to <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Gouverneur Morris</a>. I was then on my way to Virginia. The 
elections for the new government commenced shortly after my 
arrival. The first was of Electors, to Ballot for a President 
and Vice President. The successful candidates were General 
Wood, Mr. Zach y Johnson, GEN'L Edward Stephens, Doctor 
David Stuart, Mr. W. Fitzhugh of Chatham, Mr. Warner 
Lewis of Gloucester, Mr. Jno. Harvey, Mr. Walk, of or near 
Norfolk, Mr. Kello of Southampton. These nine were federal: 
ists. The remaining three, Mr. Patrick Henry, Mr. Roane of 
King and Queen, and Mr. Pride of Amelia, were of the adverse 
party. Two of the former party did not attend. The votes 
were unanimous with respect to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>, as appears 
to have been the case in each of the States. The secondary 
votes were given, among the federal members, chiefly to Mr. J. 
Adams, one or two being thrown away in order to prevent a 
possible competition for the Presidency. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> was the secondary choice of the anti-federal members. In the 
succeeding election of Representatives, federalism was also proved to be the prevailing sentiment of the people. The successful candidates on this list are Mr. Moore, late of the Executive Council, (from Rockingham,) Mr. Alexander White, Mr. 
Richard Bland Lee, Mr. John Page, (Rosewell,) Mr. Samuel 
Griffin, Mr. Brown, member of the old Congress, (from Kentucky,) J. Madison, Col. Parker, (late nav. officer at Norfolk,) 
Col. Isaac Coles, (of Halifax,) and Col. Bland. Of these, the 
seven first have been on the side of the Constitution; the three 
last in the opposition. Col. Parker appears to be very temperate, and it is not probable that both the others will be very 
inveterate. It was my misfortune to be thrown into a contest 
with our friend, Col. Monroe. The occasion produced considerable efforts among our respective friends. Between ourselves, 
I have no reason to doubt that the distinction was duly kept in 
mind between political and personal views, and that it has 
saved our friendship from the smallest diminution. On one 
side I am sure it is the case. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the lapse of time since the birthday of the 
new Government, (the 4th of March,) I am under the necessity 
of informing you that a quorum is not yet formed, either in the 
Senate or House of Representatives. The season of the year, 
the peculiar badness of the weather, and the short interval 
between the epoch of election and that of meeting, form a 
better apology for the delay than will probably occur on your 
side of the Atlantic. The deficiency at present in the House 
of Representatives requires two members only for a Quorum, 
and in the Senate one only. A few days will, therefore, fit the 
Body for the first step, to wit, opening the Ballots for the 
President and Vice President. I have already said that 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> will be the first by a unanimous suffrage. 
It is held to be certain that <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a>, though refused a great 
many votes from different motives, will have the second appointment. A considerable delay will be unavoidable, after the 
ballots are counted, before the President can be on the spot, 
and, consequently, before any Legislative act can take place. 
Such a protraction of the inactivity of the Government is to be 
regretted on many accounts, but most on account of the loss of 
revenue. A prospect of the Spring importations led to the 
appointment of the first meeting at a time which, in other 
respects, was unseasonable. 
</p><p>
It is not yet possible to ascertain precisely the complexion 
of the new Congress. A little time will be necessary to unveil 
it, and a little will probably suffice. With regard to the Constitution, it is pretty well decided that the disaffected party 
in the Senate amounts to two or three members only; and that 
in the other House it does not exceed a very small minority, 
some of which will also be restrained by the federalism of the 
States from which they come. Notwithstanding this character 
of the Body, I hope and expect that some conciliatory sacrifices 
will be made, in order to extinguish opposition to the system, 
or at least break the force of it, by detaching the deluded 
opponents from their designing leaders. With regard to the 
system of policy to which the Government is capable of rising, 
and by which its genius will be appreciated, I wait for some 
experimental instruction. Were I to advance a conjecture, it 
would be, that the predictions of an anti-democratic operation 
will be confronted with at least a sufficient number of the 
features which have marked the State Governments. 
</p><p>
Since my arrival here I have received your favor of November 18th. It had been sent on to Virginia; but not reaching 
<a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> before I passed that place, it followed me back 
hither. I am much concerned that your scheme of passing the 
ensuing summer in your native country has been defeated. Mr. 
Jay, with whom I have conversed on the subject, tells me that 
his answer to your public letter has explained the impossibility 
of giving effect to your wishes, no Congress having been formed 
under the old Confederation since the receipt of your letter, or, 
indeed, since the expiration of the last federal year. The most 
that can now be done will be to obtain from the new authority, 
as early as possible, some act which may leave the matter to 
your own discretion. Perhaps it may be neither more inconvenient to your private nor to the public affairs to make your 
visit in the fall instead of the Spring, and to pass the Winter 
instead of the Summer in America. The same cause on which 
you are to charge your disappointment in this instance prevented a decision on the question of outfit, stated in one of your 
former communications. 
</p><p>
With some printed papers containing interesting articles, I 
inclose a manuscript copy of Col. Morgan's invitation to persons disposed to seek their fortunes on the Spanish side of the 
Mississippi. There is no doubt that the project has the sanction of Gardoqui. It is a silly one on the part of Spain, and 
will probably end like the settlements on the Roman side of the 
Danube, with the concurrence of the declining empire. But it 
clearly betrays the plan suggested to you in a former letter, of 
making the Mississippi the bait for a defection of the Western 
people. Some of the leaders in Kentucky are known to favor 
the idea of connection with Spain. The people are as yet inimical to it. Their future disposition will depend on the measures of the new Government. 
</p><p>
I omitted to mention that a dispute between the Senate of 
this State, which was federal, and the other branch, which was 
otherwise, concerning the manner of appointing Senators for 
the Congress, was so inflexibly persisted in that no appointment 
was made during the late session, and must be delayed for a 
considerable time longer, even if the dispute should on a second 
trial be accommodated. It is supposed by some that the superintending power of Congress will be rendered necessary by the 
temper of the parties. The provision for the choice of electors 
was also delayed until the opportunity was lost; and that for 
the election of Representatives so long delayed that the result 
will not be decided till tuesday next. It is supposed that at 
least three out of the six will be of the federal party. In New 
Jersey, the inaccuracy of the law providing for the choice of 
Representatives has produced an almost equal delay, and left 
room for contests, which, if brought by the disappointed candidates into the House, will add a disagreeable article to the list 
of its business. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged for the two estimates on the subject of 
our foreign debt, and shall turn your ideas to the account which 
they deserv.
