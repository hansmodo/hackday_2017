DEAR SIR, If the contents of the newspapers of this place 
find their way into the Gazettes of <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, you will have 
learnt that the expedition of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel=''>General Lincoln</a> against the insurgents has effectually dispersed the main body of them. It 
appears, however, that there are still some detachments which 
remain to be subdued, and that the government of Massachusetts consider very strong precautions as necessary against 
farther eruptions. The principal incendiaries have, unluckily, 
made off. By some it is said that they are gone to Canada; 
by others, that they have taken shelter in Vermont; and by some, 
that they are opening a communication with the upper parts of 
this State. The latter suggestion has probably some color, as 
the Governor here has thought proper to offer rewards for them, 
after the example of <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='colleague'>Governor Bowdoin</a>. We have no interesting information from Europe. 
</p><p>
The only step of moment taken by Congress, since my arrival, 
has been a recommendation of the proposed meeting in May, for 
revising the federal Articles. Some of the States, considering 
this measure as an extra-constitutional one, had scruples against 
concurring in it without some regular sanction. By others, it 
was thought best that Congress should remain neutral in the 
business, as the best antidote for the jealousy of an ambitious 
desire in them to get more power into their hands. This suspense was at length removed by an instruction from this State 
to its delegates to urge a recommendatory Resolution in Congress, which accordingly passed a few days ago. Notwithstanding this instruction from N. York, there is room to suspect her disposition not to be very federal, a large majority of 
the House of Delegates having very lately entered into a definitive refusal of the impost, and the instruction itself having 
passed in the Senate by a casting vote only. In consequence 
of the sanction given by Congress, Massachusetts, it is said, 
will send Deputies to the Convention, and her example will 
have great weight with the other New England States. The 
States from North Carolina to New Jersey, inclusive, have 
made their appointments, except Maryland, who has, as yet, 
only determined that she will make them. The gentlemen here 
from South Carolina and Georgia expect that those States will 
follow the general example. Upon the whole, therefore, it 
seems probable that a meeting will take place, and that it will 
be a pretty full one. 
</p><p>
What the issue of it will be is among the other arcana of futurity, and nearly as inscrutable as any of them. In general, 
I find men of reflection much less sanguine as to a new, than 
despondent as to the present system. Indeed, the present system neither has nor deserv. advocates; and if some very strong 
props are not applied, will quickly tumble to the ground. No 
money is paid into the public Treasury; no respect is paid to 
the federal authority. Not a single State complies with the 
requisitions; several pass them over in silence, and some positively reject them. The payments, ever since the peace, have 
been decreasing, and of late fall short even of the pittance necessary for the civil list of the Confederacy. It is not possible 
that a Government can last long under these circumstances. 
</p><p>
If the approaching convention should not agree on some remedy, I am persuaded that some very different arrangement will 
ensue. The late turbulent scenes in Massachusetts, and infamous ones in Rhode Island, have done inexpressible injury to 
the republican character in that part of the United States, and 
a propensity towards monarchy is said to have been produced 
by it in some leading minds. The bulk of the people will probably prefer the lesser evil of a partition of the Union into three 
more practicable and energetic governments. The latter idea, 
I find, after long confinement to individual speculations and 
private circles, is beginning to shew itself in the newspapers. 
But though it is a lesser evil, it is so great a one that I hope 
the danger of it will rouse all the real friends of the Revolution 
to exert themselves in favor of such an organization of the Confederacy as will perpetuate the Union and redeem the honor of 
the Republican name.

I shall follow this introductory letter with a few lines from 
time to time, as a proper subject for them occurs. The only 
stipulation I exact on your part is, that you will not consider 
them as claiming either answers or acknowledgements, and that 
you will believe me to be, with sincerest wishes for your health 
and every other happiness, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and serv.
