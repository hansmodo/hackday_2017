DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 8th did not come to hand till 
this afternoon. I thank you for the very just and interesting 
observ.ions contained in it. I have. not yet met with an opportunity of forwarding the Report on manufactures, nor has 
that subject been yet regularly taken up. The Constitutional 
doctrine, however, advanced in the Report, has been anticipated 
on another occasion by its zealous friends; and I was drawn 
into a few hasty animadversions, the substance of which you 
will find in one of the inclosed papers. It gives me great pleasure to find my exposition of the Constitution so well supported 
by yours.

The Bill concerning the election of a President and vice 
President, and the eventual successor to both, which has long 
been depending, has finally got through the two Houses. It 
was made a question whether the number of electors ought to 
correspond with the new apportionment or the existing House 
of Representatives. The text of the Constitution was not decisive, and the Northern interest was strongly in favor of the 
latter interpretation. The intrinsic rectitude, however, of the 
former, turned the decision in both houses in favor of the Southern. On another point the Bill certainly errs. It provides that 
in case of a double vacancy, the Executive powers shall devolve 
on the President pro tempore of the Senate, and he failing, on 
the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The objections 
to this arrangement are various: 1. It may be questioned 
whether these are officers in the Constitutional sense. 2. If officers, whether both could be introduced. 3. As they are created by the Constitution, they would probably have been there 
designated if contemplated for such a serv.e, instead of being 
left to the Legislative selection. 4. Either they will retain 
their Legislative stations, and then incompatible functions will 
be blended; or the incompatibility will supersede those stations, 
and then those being the substratum of the adventitious functions, these must fail also. The Constitution says, Congress 
may declare what officers, &c., which seems to make it not an 
appointment or a translation, but an annexation of one office or 
trust to another office. The House of Representatives proposed 
to substitute the Secretary of State, but the Senate disagreed, 
and there being much delicacy in the matter it was not pressed 
by the former. 
</p><p>
Another Representation Bill has gone to the Senate, modelled 
on the double idea mentioned in my last. 1 for 30,000 is the 
ratio fixed both for the late and the proposed census. The fate 
of the Bill in the Senate is problematical. The Bill immediately 
before the House of Representatives is a Militia Bill.
