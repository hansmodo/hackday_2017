DEAR SIR, My last enclosed a continuation of the Federalist to number 14, inclusive. I now add the numbers which have succeeded. 
</p><p>
No authentic information has yet arrived concerning the posture of Europe. Reports, with some less doubtful symptoms, countenance the suspicions of war. 
</p><p>
I understand that the Constitution will certainly be adopted 
in Connecticut, the returns of the Deputies being now known, 
and a very great majority found to be its declared and firm 
friends. There will be more opposition in Massachusetts, but 
its friends there continue to be very sanguine of victory. New 
Hampshire, as far as I can learn, may be set down on the right 
list. 
</p><p>
I remain, dear Sir, with the highest respect and the most 
unfeigned attachment, your obedient, humble serv.t. 
</p>
