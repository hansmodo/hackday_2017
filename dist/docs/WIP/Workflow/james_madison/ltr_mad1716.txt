DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 31 ult., and the preceding one 
without date, have been received. The refusal of Dunlap in 
the case you mention confirms the idea of a combined influence 
against the freedom of the press. If symptoms of a dangerous 
success in the experiment should shew themselves, it will be 
necessary, before it be too late, to convey to the public through 
the channels that remain open an explicit statement of the fact, 
and a proper warning of its tendency. In the mean time, it is, 
perhaps, best to avoid any premature denunciations that might 
fix wavering or timid presses on the wrong side. You say that 
the subject of the three millions of florins is to be revived. 
Have you discovered in what mode; whether through the next 
Congress or through the press; and if the latter, whether avowedly or anonymously ? I suspect that the President may not 
be satisfied with the aspect under which that and other parts 
of the fiscal administration have been left. 
</p><p>
As far as I can learn, the people of this country continue to 
be united and firm in the political sentiments expressed by their 
Representatives. The re-election of all who were most decided 
in those sentiments is among the proofs of the fact. 
</p><p>
The only individual discontinued is the one who dissented 
most from his colleagues. The vote at the election stood thus: 
for R., 886; S., 403; W., 276. It is said that the singular vote 
on assuming the balances gave the coup de grace to his popularity. We were told at <a href="/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a> that if the member for 
that district had been opposed, his election would have failed; 
and at <a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, that a notice of G-.'s vote on the resolutions of censure had nearly turned the scale against him. I 
have seen and conversed with Mr. F. Walker. I think it impossible he can go otherwise than right. He tells me that J. 
Cole, and not Clay, as in the newspapers, is elected for the Halifax District. Hancock is the new member from the district 
adjoining Moore, and Preston for that beyond him. I fell in 
with Mr. Brackenridge on his way to Kentucky. He had adverted to Greenup's late vote with indignation, and dropped 
threats of its effect on his future pretensions. 
</p><p>
The sympathy with the fate of Louis has found its way pretty 
generally into the mass of our citizens; but relating merely to 
the man, and not to the Monarch, and being derived from the 
spurious accounts in the papers of his innocence, and the blood-thirstyness of his enemies, I have not found a single instance in 
which a fair statement of the case has not new-modelled the 
sentiment. " If he was a Traitor, he ought to be punished as 
well as another man." This has been the language of so many 
plain men to me, that I am persuaded it will be found to express the universal sentiment, whenever the truth shall be made 
known. 
</p><p>
Our fields continue to anticipate a luxuriant harvest. The 
greatest danger is apprehended from too rapid a vegetation 
under the present warm and moist weather. The night before 
last it received a small check from a smart frost. The thermometer was down at 37, and we were alarmed for the fruit. 
It appears, however, that no harm was done. We have at present the most plentiful prospect of every kind of it. 
</p><p>
Will you be go good, in case an opportunity should offer, to 
enquire of Doctor Logan as to the ploughs he was to have made 
and sent to Mrs. House's, and to repay what may have been 
advanced for those and two or three other articles that were 
to be forwarded to <a href="/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> by water? I forgot to 
make the proper arrangements before I left <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 
Adieu. Yours affectionately.
