MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
Mr. S called upon us a day or two ago, and delivered me your kind letter of July the 20th. It 
was of a later date than any I had received from 
you, though near four months old. It was a little 
unfortunate for the gentleman, that <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> entered immediately into an inquiry of him respecting 
the state and commerce of the Massachusetts, of 
which, be sure, the gentleman drew a most gloomy 
picture, and finished the whole by saying, that the 
people in the United States were as much oppressed 
by taxes as they were in Europe. This being so 
wholly groundless, it roused the quick feelings of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>, who replied, a little warmly, " Give me 
leave to tell you, Sir, that people who hold this 
language, betray a total ignorance of the subject. 
Name the article in this country, even to the light 
of heaven, the air you breathe, and the water you 
drink, which is not taxed. Loaded down with accumulated burdens is this free people, yet the whole 
is not sufficient to pay even the interest of the national debt, and the charges of government. Mr. 
Pitt's surplus is a vision, and new methods of taxation must be devised. Pray, are our farmers perishing in the midst of plenty, as in Ireland ? Are 
our fishermen starving ? Cannot the laborer find a 
subsistence ? Or has the price of labor fallen to 
sixpence, and subsistence risen to a shilling ? Or 
is it only trade that languishes ? Thank God, that 
necessity, then, will oblige those who have lived 
luxuriously at the expense of others, and upon property which was not their own, to do so no longer. 
There is not a merchant in England, France, or 
Holland, with a capital which could buy fifty of our 
most opulent merchants, that lives at half the expense which I have been informed many of ours 
have run into during the war, and since.'" 
</p><p>
By this time I had got into that part of your letter, 
which informed me that Mr. S had been unfortunate in business. I knew Mr. Aclasis was a perfect 
stranger to this, and could design nothing against the 
gentleman ; but still I felt pained for him, as I presumed he had never had such a lesson before. He 
drew in his horns, and was more upon his guard the 
remainder of the time. We asked him to dine with 
us the next day, but he was engaged. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> 
will return his visit, and then we shall send him a 
card of invitation. In his manners and address he 
appears much of a gentleman. 
</p><p>
The accounts you gave me of the singing of your 
birds, and the prattle of your children, entertained 
me much. Do you know that European birds have 
not half the melody of ours ? Nor is their fruit 
half so sweet, nor their flowers half so fragrant, nor 
their manners half so pure, nor their people half so 
virtuous ; but keep this to yourself, or I shall be 
thought more than half deficient in understanding 
and taste. I will not dispute what every person 
must assent to ; that the fine arts, manufactures, 
and agriculture have arrived at a greater degree of 
maturity and perfection. But what is their age ? 
What their individual riches, when compared with 
us ? Far removed from my mind may the national prejudice be, of conceiving all that is good and 
excellent comprised within the narrow compass of 
the United States. The Universal Parent has dispensed his blessings throughout all creation, and, 
though to some he hath given a more goodly heritage than to others, we have reason to believe that 
a general order and harmony are maintained by 
apportioning ta each his proper station. Though 
seas, mountains, and rivers are geographical boundaries, they contract not the benevolence and good will 
of the liberal mind, which can extend itself beyond 
the limits of country and kindred, and claim fellowship with Christian, Jew, or Turk. What a lesson 
did the great Author of our religion give to mankind 
by the parable of the Jew and the Samaritan ; but 
how little has it been regarded ! To the glory of the 
present age, they are shaking off that narrow, contracted spirit of priestcraft and usurpation, which has 
for so many ages tyrannized over the minds of mankind, and deluged the world in blood. They consider religion not as a state stalking-horse, to raise 
men to temporal power and dignity ; but as a wise 
and benevolent system, calculated to still the boisterous passions, to restrain the malevolent ones, to 
curb the ambitious, and to harmonize mankind to 
the temper of its great Author, who came to make 
peace, and not to destroy. The late act of toleration, passed by Virginia, is esteemed here as an example to the world.

We are now really in the gloomy month of November, such as I have heard it described, but did 
not last year experience. Now we have it, all 
smoke, fog, and darkness ; and the general mourning for the Princess Amelia adds to the gloom of 
the scene. I was yesterday at the drawing-room, for 
the first time since her death ; and, though I cannot 
say all faces gathered blackness, all bodies appeared 
</p><p>
so. As she had given her fortune lo her German 
nephews, it would have been absurd to have shown 
any appearance of grief. Poor John Bull is vastly 
angry and mortified. Had it been given to the 
Prince of Wales, his liberal hand would soon have 
poured forth the golden shower ; and, as his aunt 
acquired it all in this nation, here it ought to have 
remained, says John ; but he cannot alter it, so he 
vents himself, as usual, in abuse and bellowing. 
Adieu. Your sister,
