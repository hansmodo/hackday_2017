My dear General, 
This letter will be delivered by the celebrated M. Houdon, who is going, for your statue, to America. 
</p><p>
Nothing but the love of glory and his respect for you could induce him to cross the seas, as his business 
here far exceeds his leisure; and his numerous and gratified friends make him very happy at home. 
These circumstances I mention as a farther recommendation to your attentions. As I am writing by the same opportunity, I will only add a tribute of the 
tender love and grateful respect, [with which] I have the honor to be, my dear General, yours, 
</p><p>
