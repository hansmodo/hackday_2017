To His Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
It is with the greatest satisfaction I acquaint you 
that the plan of arrangement for the army, which 
your Excellency sent to Congress, has been agreed 
upon yesterday, without any alteration. The granting the half-pay for life, to the reduced officers, has 
met with some opposition; but the proposition has 
not only passed, but it was moved and resolved, immediately after, to extend these advantages to all the 
officers in the service. 
</p><p>
In the minutes which <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel=''>Colonel Hamilton</a> has delivered me, by your Excellency's order, I find that 
the four regiments of cavalry, or rather legions, were 
thus fixed ; â€” 
</p><p>
Four troops of mounted dragoons, sixty men each, 240 
</p><p>
Four companies dismounted, or chasseurs, sixty men each, 240 
</p><p>
Total, 480 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague met'>General Sullivan</a> and Colonel Bland have told me that this is altered in your Excellency's letter; and that there are to be 
Four troops of mounted dragoons, sixty men each, ....... 240 
</p><p>
Two companies of chasseurs, sixty men each, 120 
</p><p>
Total, 360 
</p><p>
Your Excellency "will allow me to make here a 
short observation on the subdivision of this cavalry, 
without altering the totality of the foot or horsemen. 
Cavalry, especially when two deep, is not very terrible in their attacks in front, and least so when 
against infantry. The attacks of the cavalry, when 
they intend to overthrow or break a line, are generally made by troops or squadrons, or in column, or 
in echiqidcr (checkerwise). The deeper they are, the 
surer they are to break through. If, then, instead of 
four, a regiment was divided into six troops, the object would be better answered. 
</p><p>
There is another reason, which has determined the 
King of Prussia to divide his light-horse, or hussars, 
into six companies, forming three squadrons. The 
cavalry, after an attack, is generally in disorder ; they 
must then be rallied by the sound of the trumpet. 
When they are divided into three squadrons, the 
right, left, and centre only indicate how the men are 
to rally, which is not so easy when they are divided 
into four troops. When three squadrons are in order 
of battle, the signals, whether the right, left, or centre squadron is to charge, still meet with difficulty 
when the cavalry is divided into four squadrons or 
troops ; and this is the reason why, in several European services, an odd number has been adopted for 
the manoeuvres of the light-horse. 
</p><p>
Besides, our regiments of cavalry will have, I believe, as those of infantry, three Field-Officers. Each 
of them will then command a squadron, which will 
consist of two companies. Wherefore I propose that 
each regiment of cavahy may be divided into three 
squadrons, each squadron into two companies, each of 
which shall consist of forty men, which will make 
eighty men for a squadron. The companies of chasseurs ouo-ht to be likewise three in number, each 
company to consist of fifty men, rank and file, attached, on all occasions, to the first, second, and third 
squadron of the regiment. And, as it often happens 
that the squadrons are separated from one another, 
each company of chasseurs ought to be always 
attached to its squadron, as well to support it in its 
manoeuvres as to guard it in its quarters. As, by this 
subdivision, the totality will not suffer a great alteration, I believe it will not alter the general plan. I 
will, therefore, mention it to no one besides your Excellency; and I think it is in your power to order 
this subdivision, if you think proper. 
</p><p>
I am not very happy in the arrangement of my 
department. The plan relative thereto, which your 
Excellency has delivered to the Committee which was 
at camp, after having been a little altered by that 
Committee, was sent to Congress. Congress referred 
it to the Board of War, who, after having altered it, 
sent it back to Congress, who thought proper to refer 
it to a Committee of three, who made new alterations. 
Now it has been so much altered, that it does not at 
all resemble itself No intimation was officially given 
me of it, and I read it in a printed copy, which fell 
accidentally into my hands. I have the honor to 
transmit one to your Excellency. 
</p><p>
The monthly addition of from five to eight dollars 
to the pay of officers of such merit as those whom 
your Excellency has chosen for the Inspectorship, appears to me so very mean, that I will not take upon myself to make them such a proposition. When the 
ancient Majors of brigade, who, in the first institution, 
were taken from the line of Lieutenants or Ensigns, 
had an addition to their pay of twenty-four dollars per 
month, how can nine dollars now be proposed to a 
Colonel for discharging so important and so painful a 
function? I am now endeavouring to find how much 
the Muster-master's department has cost the States. 
I am sure that the addition I ask for the Officers of 
Inspectorship will not amount to an eighth part of it. 
Several resolutions, in this arrangement, are contradictory to one another, and others are not sufficiently 
clear. I am therefore determined to present a Memorial to Congress, in order to have the Inspectors' department established on the footing proposed by your 
Excellency, without any alteration. If Congress desire that I should continue in this office, I flatter 
myself they will have a regard to my representation.

I am, &c..
