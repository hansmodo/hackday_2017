I RECEIVED your obliging favor by Mrs. Morgan, with the papers and the other articles you sent, which 
were very acceptable to me, as they are not to be purchased here. I shall be very choice of them. 
</p><p>
I have, according to your desire, been upon a visit to Mrs. Morgan, who keeps at <a href="/results.php?tla=thm" rel="met acquaintance">Major Mifflin's</a>. I 
had received a message from Mrs. Mifflin some time ago, desiring I would visit her. My father, who, 
you know, is very obliging in this way, accompanied me, and I had the pleasure of drinking coffee with 
the Doctor and his lady, the Major and his lady, and a. Mr. and Mrs. Smith from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, a daughter 
of the famous son of liberty, Captain Sears ; <a href="/results.php?tla=thm" rel="">Generals Gates</a> and Lee ; a Dr. M Henry and a Mr. Ehvyn, 
with many others who were strangers to me. I was very politely entertained, and noticed by the 
generals ; more especially General Lee, who was very urgent with me to tarry in town, and dine with 
him and the ladies present, at Hobgoblin Hall, but I excused myself. The General was determined, that 
I should not only be acquainted with him, but with his companions too, and therefore placed a chair 
before me, into which he ordered Mr. Spada to mount and present his paw to me for a better acquaintance. I could not do otherwise than accept it. 
</p><p>
"That, Madam," says he, "is the dog which 
Mr. has rendered famous." 
</p><p>
I was so little while in company with these persons, and the company so mixed, that it was almost 
impossible to form any judgment of them. The Doctor appeared modest, and his lady affable and 
agreeable. <a href="/results.php?tla=thm" rel="met acquaintance">Major Mifflin</a>, you know, I was always an admirer of, as well as of his delicate lady. I 
believe <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> must be an unfertile soil, or it would not produce so many unfruitful women. I always conceive of these persons as wanting one addition to their happiness ; but, in these perilous 
times, I know not, whether it ought to be considered as an infelicity, since they are certainly freed 
from the anxiety every parent must feel for their rising offspring. 
</p><p>
I drank coffee one day with <a href="/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="met acquaintance">General Sullivan</a> upon Winter Hill. He appears to be a man of sense and 
spirit. His countenance denotes him of a warm constitution, not to be very suddenly moved, but, when 
once roused, not very easily lulled, easy and social, well calculated for a military station, as he 
seems to be possessed of those popular qualities, necessary to attach men to him. 
</p><p>
By the way, I congratulate you upon our late noble acquisition of military stores. It is a most 
grand mortar, I assure you. Surely Heaven smiles upon us in many respects, and we have continually 
to speak of mercies, as well as of judgments. I wish our gratitude may be anywise proportionate to 
our benefits. I suppose, in Congress, you think of every thing relative to trade and commerce, as well 
as other things ; but, as I have been desired to mention to you some things, I shall not omit them. 
One is, that there may be something done, in a Continental way, with regard to excise upon spirituous 
liquors, that each of the New England colonies may be upon the same footing ; whereas we formerly 
used to pay an excise, and the other colonies none, or very little, by which means they drew away our 
trade. That an excise is necessary, though it may be objected to by the mercantile interest, as a too 
frequent use of spirits endangers the well being of society. Another article is, that some method may 
be devised to keep among us our gold and silver, which are now every day shipped off to the West Indies for molasses, coffee, and sugar ; and this I can say of my own knowledge, that a dollar in silver is now become a great rarity, and our traders will give 
you a hundred pounds of paper for ninety of silver, or nearly that proportion. If any trade is allowed 
to the West Indies, would it not be better to carry some commodity of our own produce in exchange? 
Medicines, cotton wool, and some other articles, we are in great want of. Formerly we used to purchase 
cotton wool at one shilling, lawful money, per bag ; now it is three, and the scarcity of that article distresses us, as it was wrought up with less trouble 
than any other article of clothing. Flax is now from a shilling to one and sixpence per pound, sheep's 
wool eighteen pence, and linens not to be had at any price. I cannot mention the article in the English goods way, which is not double ; and, in the West 
India, molasses by retail I used formerly to purchase at one and eight pence, now it is two and eight pence ; rum, three shillings ; coffee, one and three 
pence, and all other things in proportion. Corn is four shillings per bushel ; rye, five ; oats, three and 
eight pence ; hay, five and six shillings per hundred ; wood, twenty shillings per cord ; but meat of all kinds cheap. 
</p><p>
My uncle Quincy desires to be remembered to you; he inquired when you talked of coming home. 
</p><p>
I told him you had not fixed any time. He says, if you don t come soon, he would advise me to procure another husband. He, of all persons, ought not to 
give me such advice, I told him, unless he set a better example himself. 
</p><p>
Be kind enough to burn this letter. It is written in great haste, and a most incorrect scrawl it is. 
But I cannot conclude without telling you, we are all very angry with your House of Assembly for their instructions." They raise prejudices in the minds of 
people, and serve to create in their minds a terror at a separation from a people wholly unworthy of us. 
We are a little of the spaniel kind ; though so often spurned, still to fawn, argues a meanness of spirit, 
that, as an individual, I disclaim, and would rather endure any hardship than submit to it. 
</p><p>
Yours.
