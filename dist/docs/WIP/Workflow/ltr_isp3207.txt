DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
This morning we had information from our guard-boats, That there were two ships of war, three tenders, and a large number 
of fiat-bottomed boats, coming up the river. They proceeded up 
as far as Tarry Town, where they landed their men. This evening they were followed by one large man-of-war, five topsail vessels, and a large number of small craft. I have sent off parties 
to examine their route, and harass their march, if prudent. 
</p><p>
General Parsons has gone down to reconnoitre. He has not 
yet returned; but by information from several different quarters, 
we have reason to believe they intend for this post. They are 
now making up, as we hear, for Croton Bridge. You will please 
to give such orders to the militia, in consequence thereof, as you 
shall think proper. I have sent the barge to you with this, and 
most sincerely wish you would come down as soon as convenient. 
I should have wrote you before, but I thought this movement 
only to drive off some cattle, &c. I am, dear Sir, with great 
regard, 
</p><p>
Your most humble servant, 
</p><p>
