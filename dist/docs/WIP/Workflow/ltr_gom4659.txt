Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will see by the gazettes the state of affairs as given to 
the public ; but much allowance must be made, as I have 
already had occasion to mention. It is, however, clear that 
the greater part of those troops, which adhered to Dumouriez, 
have returned to their country and many to their standards. 
It is evident, also, that the Prince de Cobourg's conduct in holding out against the old constitution has been disapproved by his masters and their associates, since he has found it pro 
per to recall that proclamation ; but whether it be for what is 
there said as to the government, or as to the territory of 
France, may admit of doubt ; perhaps there may be a little of 
both in the objections made against it. 
</p><p>
The delay to be noticed in the operations of the allied 
armies proves, in my opinion, two important facts ; one, that 
they mean to leave as little as possible to chance, and, there 
fore, wait the arrival of all their forces ; and, the other, that 
the original plans of the campaign are to be steadily pursued. 
Hence I infer, that the supposed disunion, mentioned in my 
last, does not exist in any essential degree. It seems that the 
Austrian artillery was not come up, until very lately, so as to 
open the trenches against Conde, which hitherto has been 
rather invested than besieged. It seems also that the Han 
overian troops have come on so slowly, as to have given every 
advantage to the French armies in Holland, if the successes 
of the Prince de Cobourg in Flanders had not rendered the 
proposed invasion abortive. However, the period being now 
arrived, about which it might reasonably be expected that the 
weather would permit of offensive operations, and the coun 
try afford resources to the cavalry of the armies, we shall 
soon know somewhat of the comparative strength of parties. 
</p><p>
On the northern frontier, they have to besiege not only 
Conde, but Valenciennes, Bouchain, and Cambray, in order 
to open a road in the direct line of advance ; besides which, 
it would seem, that they want Douay and Arras on the right, 
with Bavay and Maubeuge on the left, to cover their flanks. 
Hence results the formation of seven sieges after Conde, in 
order to open the road fairly to Paris, while on the sea coast 
they would want only Dunkirk and Calais ; after which, they 
might march surely along the coast, taking possession of the 
ports, and erecting slight works to cover their retreat, should 
retreat become necessary. I am persuaded, therefore, that 
the main efforts will be made still in that last direction, unless 
intelligences are established in the towns on the other route. 
</p><p>
I learn, but on slender authority, that the citizens of Valenciennes and the regular troops are not disposed to resist. 
The militia, or volontaires, are, however, well determined. I 
know that the government are very apprehensive as to Normandy, and I still believe in a descent there, and consequent 
revolt. You will have seen that the insurgents on the south 
west of the Loire have had hitherto very great success, 
although the gazettes have teemed with accounts of the vic 
tories obtained over them. That they have hitherto received 
no succor from abroad, confirms me in my opinion, that the 
main blow is to be struck on the side of Normandy, unless 
indeed the enemies of France are absolutely blind. 
</p><p>
I learn that the army of Biron has suffered very severely 
in the defeats, all published as victories gained over the Piedmontese. However, as yet the French territory, notwith 
standing the numerous foes, remains untouched, though on all 
sides greatly menaced.

Enclosed you have copies of my letters of the twenty-eighth of April and fourteenth instant to <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, the 
minister of Foreign Affairs, with that of his answer of the 
seventeenth, and my reply of to day. These pieces require 
no comment. I have, &c.
