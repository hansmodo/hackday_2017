Sir, 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mr Rogers, is a native of Maryland, whom I fortunately met in the hotel I some months lodged in. 
</p><p>
He was in Paris finishing his education, and by my advice accepted the office of aid-de-camp to Mons. du Coudray, and accompanies him out to America. I have received 
many kindnesses from him, and, confident of his integrity, have intrusted him with many things to relate to you viva voce, especially should my despatches fail. He has a general knowledge of the history of my proceedings, and what I 
have at times to struggle with. As he speaks French tolerably, he will I conceive prove a valuable acquisition, at a time 
when such numbers of foreigners are crowding to enter your 
service. 
</p><p>
I am, wishing him a speedy and safe arrival, with the 
most profound respect for the Congress, etc.
