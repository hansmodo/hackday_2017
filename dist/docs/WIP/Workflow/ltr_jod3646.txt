MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HOPE to get into the house on Monday next, but 
shall purchase no nice furniture till you come. I 
shall make a little establishment for myself and keep 
bachelors hall for some time. I have procured 
some horses and a carriage, and ride on horseback as 
often as the weather will permit. 
</p><p>
We have no authentic news from Europe. These 
long east winds may bring us something. I sent you 
the last letters from our sons dated about the middle 
of December. Mr. Murray is to go to Holland arid 
Mr. Dandridge as his secretary, so that Thomas will 
come home directly, I hope. I would not even ad 
vise him to go to France. I hope to have one of my 
children near me. It would have given me great 
pleasure to have had some ( f my family present at my 
inauguration, which was the most affecting and over 
powering scene I ever acted in. I was very unwell, 
had no sleep the night before, and really did not know 
but I should have fainted in presence of all the world, 
I was in great doubt whether to say any thing or not 
besides repeating the oath. And now, the world is 
as silent as the grave. All the federalists seem to be 
afraid to approve any body but Washington. The 
Jacobin papers damn with faint praise, and undermine 
with misrepresentation and insinuation. If the federalists go to playing pranks, I will resign the office, 
and let Jefferson lead them to peace, wealth and power if he will. 
</p><p>
From the situation where I now am, I see a scene 
of ambition beyond all my former suspicions or imaginations ; an emulation which will turn our government topsy-turvy. Jealousies and rivalries have been 
my theme, and checks and balances as their antidotes 
till I am ashamed to repeat the words ; but they 
never stared me in the face in such horrid forms as 
at present. I see how the thing is going. At the 
next election England will set up Jay or Hamilton, 
and France, Jefferson, and all the corruption of Po 
land will be introduced ; unless the American spirit 
should rise and say, we will have neither John Bull nor 
Louis Baboon. 
</p><p>
Silence. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
