Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliging letters of the 18th ult. and 3d inst., after 
passing through various hands and places, were at length 
delivered to me two days ago. Your elegant panegyric 
on the amiable character and benevolent designs of his 
Britannic majesty meets with general approbation ; and 
some do not hesitate to predict that it will stimulate your 
gracious prince to embrace the first opportunity of exalting 
you. On reading the proclamation against picking and stealing, I could not forbear wishing there had been one 
pasted on the foreheads of our late protectors. Nothing 
but the chance of their being predestined to go to heaven 
can save them from a campaign in the opposite regions. 
The least they can expect, with any degree of modesty, is 
to be decimated. They seem to have acted as if they 
thought themselves tenants in common in all the good 
things they met with, and that posterior, instead of prior 
occupancy, enabled them to hold in severalty. 
</p><p>
At a time when the most strenuous efforts are necessary 
to our political salvation, it is to be regretted that any of 
our measures should bear the marks of feeble or dispirited 
counsels. Your militia bill should have been so framed as 
to give birth to strong and decisive executive powers. I 
should have thought the spirit of the speech, added to the 
remembrance of the barbarous ravages of the enemy, 
would have diffused through the Legislature a degree of 
resentment, determination, and enthusiasm, which would 
have been productive of regulations better adapted to the 
times. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear sir, 
With the greatest respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
