Sir, 
</p><p>
Although I have not had the pleasure of your acquaintance, I am not a stranger to your merit. 
</p><p>
On receiving your favour of the 11th ult., I sent a copy 
of it to his excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>, and warmly recommended your case to his attention. I am persuaded he will 
do all in his power for your relief, and that the distinguished prisoner of war in England. 
</p><p>
Not being authorized by Congress to provide for American prisoners in England, I could not justify undertaking it, 
and therefore referred your application to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>, 
within whose department that business appears to me 
to fall. 
</p><p>
I shall always be ready as an individual to contribute to 
the relief of my distressed countrymen, and should now 
give you proof of it ; but as your case and that of your 
fellow-prisoners ought to be, and probably are provided for 
by the public, I think assistance should there be asked and 
denied, before it can become the duty of private benevolence to supply public omissions. 
</p><p>
If the application to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> should be fruitless, I 
shall then consider myself bound, as a good American, to 
contribute towards the relief of a fellow-citizen, who has 
so nobly fought in the cause of our country ; and I shall in 
that case desire Mr. Williams, at Nantz, who forwarded 
your letter to me, to advance you fifty dollars on my private 
account ; which sum you will repay to me whenever you 
may be in circumstances to do it, for should misfortunes 
delay or prevent your being in that situation, it would be 
more agreeable to me to advance you a farther sum, than 
to demand the repayment of this. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with real esteem, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
