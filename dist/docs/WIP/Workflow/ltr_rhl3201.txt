DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have no doubt of being excused by you for not 
sooner answering your favor of the 24th last, when 
you are informed that my ill state of health has prevented me from attending, as I ought, to the important matter it contains. I gave Mr. Jones the letter, 
that he might inform Congress of such parts as it 
imported the public they should be acquainted with. 
As it appeared, by the letters of <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a>, that 
he objected only to serve in the Quarter-masters Department, that his health was returning, and that he 
was willing to continue his aid to the public cause, 
Congress appointed him one of the Commissioners of 
the new Board, because he is competent to the right 
discharge of its duties, because that would best suit 
his valetudinary state, and as showing a just sense 
of his uniform, vigorous, and well-founded patriotism. 
I have strong hopes that, by the skill and industry 
of this new Board, and from the right execution of 
business in that important department, you will, in 
future, find great relief. 
</p><p>
General Conway has not lately been mentioned in 
Congress, nor has there been much talk of an Adjutant-General, since it is not certainly known whether 
<a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a> will accept his new appointment. 
Mr. Fleming's character stands very fair, and, so far as I am able to judge, he would answer well in this 
Commission. You will see, in the inclosed, what Mr. 
Sergeant says of him. j <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> has proposed a 
plan for the Quarter-master's Department, that appears 
judicious, and well fitted to answer the purpose of 
good service and economy at the same time. He 
would divide this department into its military and 
civil branches ; the former to be filled by a person 
well qualified to discharge its duties, and the latter 
again to be divided into Commissaries of Teams, of 
Forage, of Tents, &c., to be governed in their purchases by estimates from the Quartermaster-General, , 
who is to touch no money but a moderate and sufficient salary. 
</p><p>
It is Unfortunately too true, that our enemies pay 
little regard to good faith, or any obligations of justice and humanity, which renders the Convention of 
<a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> a matter of great moment ; and it is also, 
as you justly observe, an affair of infinite delicacy. 
The undoubted advantage they will take, even of the 
appearance of infraction on our part, and the American character, which is concerned in preserving its 
faith inviolate, cover this affair with difficulties, and 
prove the disadvantage we are under in conducting 
war against an old, corrupt, and powerful people, who, 
having much credit and influence in the world, will 
venture on things that would totally ruin the reputation of young and rising communities like ours. 
</p><p>
The English, however, were not to blame in the 
business of Closter Seven. That Convention was left 
incomplete by the Commanders who made it. It was 
stipulated, particularly, that the Court of Versailles 
must ratify, and that within a certain time, which 
was not done until long after the time was elapsed, 
and before which ratification the troops of Hanover 
had returned to arms. Upon this occasion, the good 
faith of England is not impeached. 
</p><p>
It is greatly to be regretted that the situation of 
your army unfits it for vigorous action, because it is 
very obvious that the enemy's possession of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> this winter and the ensuing spring, may produce consequences extensively injurious. You well 
know, Sir, how weak and divided the people of this 
State are from various causes. Those of Delaware are 
still worse. In this condition, with the infinite arts 
of our enemies, pushed up almost to the centre of 
the above Governments, and aided by the powerful 
means of supplying the wants, fanciful and real, of 
the people, with all kinds of European goods and 
salt, it will be no great matter of surprise if we were 
to find a total revolution in Pennsylvania and Dela 
ware. Add to this, the ill condition of our finances, 
which totter upon every seeming success of the 
enemy. 
</p><p>
It is not to be supposed that, where so much is at 
stake, Great Britain will fail to make most potent 
efforts to recover her honor, and prevent her ruin. 
Upon this ground, we may expect considerable reenforcements, and early as possible in the spring. With 
an army much strengthened, General Howe may effect 
purposes dangerous to America, It happens, too, unluckily for us, that, in order to support the credit of 
our money, the several States must, of necessity, impose large and immediate taxes. This is the most 
delicate and difficult of all Government operations, 
even in old and undisturbed states. Yet it is una 
voidable, and Congress have pressingiy requested that 
it may be quickly and extensively entered upon. 
</p><p>
It was most evident, to discerning men, that the 
change in the Commissariat, at the time it was adopted, would produce most mischievous consequences, 
yet such was the rage of reformation, that no endeavours to prevent the evil could avail and now I 
feel the most anxious solicitude, for fear the consequences may disperse our army even in face of the 
enemy. A Committee is appointed to confer with 
the Commissary-General, and to try what can be 
done to avert the evil. I wish they may be fortunate enough to hit upon a remedy. That there 
should be a want of flour amazes me, and proves 
great want of attention in the Commissary-General, 
because I well know that any quantity might have , 
been got in Virginia at a reasonable price. 
</p><p>
By our last despatches from the West Indies, it 
would seem as if a war between France and England 
was inevitable, unless the latter should restore all her 
captures made from the former without the limits 
prescribed by treaty, and which have been made under authority of an Act of Parliament. But the 
royal spleen against America is such, that every consideration falls before the wish to subjugate this free country. Yet Mr. Bingham mentions, that the ministerial writings are calculated to rouse the national 
resentment against France. If so, it is evident they 
want to set Europe on fire, that the smoke may 
cover them from the eyes of their injured country. 
Mr. Carmichael writes that Dr. Lee was returning to 
Paris from Berlin, having finished his business success 
fully at the Prussian Court; and Mr. Bingham says 
it is certain that the King of Prussia has opened his 
ports to the United State's, and that Portugal has 
deserted the interest of England, and acceded to the 
family compact. This is all good news, and will, I 
hope, furnish employment quickly for our unprincipled enemies.
</p><p>
My ill state of health will compel me to return 
home in a few days, where I shall continue ardently 
to pray for your health and success. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
