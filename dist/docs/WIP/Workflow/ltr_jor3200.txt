DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your favor of the 16th instant, 
directing the march of the city light-horse, for which 
the necessary orders will be given, and they will 
proceed with all possible despatch. Upon the new 
plan of our militia, there are light-horse attached to 
the troops of every county. The short time since 
the plan has been adopted has not permitted a 
thorough execution; but, if your Excellency should 
be of opinion they would be specially useful, I shall 
endeavour to have them completed as soon as may 
be. The troop of the county of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is already well mounted, armed, and in uniform. I do 
assure your Excellency every stimulus has been used 
to forward the recruits. According to information, 
they are chiefly selected, and only wait a proper 
equipment; but, as I found this was tedious in the 
country, I directed them to be sent hither, and they 
are now coming in. I am of opinion, if your Excellency could spare a few officers, say five or six, prudent and discreet, who could bear with the oddities 
and humors of the persons with whom they will 
have to do, it might forward the men; and, as it 
is proposed to set about a voluntary additional enlistment, as soon as this is over, we are sanguine enough to believe some men might be had. For 
this purpose some clever sergeants would be of great 
service. 
</p><p>
The spirit, which your Excellency seems to wish, 
I think, is recovered beyond expectation. The loss 
of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, like many other seeming misfortunes, 
may perhaps (heavy as it now appears) prove a real 
blessing to America, A measure has been set on 
foot here to establish a bank, which, from the unanimity with which it is espoused, seems likely to produce considerable advantages, and supplies to the 
army. It was at first constructed upon so narrow a 
scale as to meet with difficulties; but, being since 
enlarged, I hope will prove a more fruitful source of 
supply than the occasional expedients from time to 
time adopted. Whatever measure promotes the public good, shall have my aid and concurrence, from 
whatever quarter it proceeds. 
The ladies of the place have also caught the happy contagion, and, in a few days, Mrs. Reed will have 
the honor of writing to you on that subject. It is expected she will have a sum equal to one hundred 
thousand pounds, to be laid out according to your Excellency's direction (in the absence of Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>) in such a way as may be thought most 
honorable and gratifying to the brave old soldiers who have borne so great a share of the burden of 
this war. I thought it best to mention it in this way to your Excellency, for your consideration, as it 
may tend to forward the benevolent scheme of the donors with despatch. I must observe, that the ladies 
have excepted such articles of necessity as clothing, &c., which the States are bound to provide. 
</p><p>
We have just heard that Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> is upon 
the road to this city, so that we shall have the benefit of her advice and assistance here, and, if necessary, refer afterwards to your Excellency. I am, with 
the greatest respect and regard, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
