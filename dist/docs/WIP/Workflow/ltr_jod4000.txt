My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
I blush to acknowledge that I received your favour of 
the 6th February, in its season, and in good condition, and 
that I have not answered it. 
</p><p>
By leading a quiet life, and by great care and regular exercise, I have happily recovered a little health, and if you 
think it necessary, I might now venture on a journey to Paris. But I should be glad to wait here six weeks longer, 
that I may increase my stock of strength a little more, if possible, provided you will give me leave. I should be glad 
to know what you have upon the carpet, and how advanced, in brief, if you please. 
</p><p>
The money for the payment of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a>'s bills is happily secured, but we were a long time in bringing the loan to bear. 
</p><p>
I have received several letters from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, from very good hands, which make very honourable and affectionate mention of you. You have erected a 
monument to your memory in every New-England heart. 
My regards to your good family, and believe me, 
</p><p>
Your sincere friend, 
</p><p>
