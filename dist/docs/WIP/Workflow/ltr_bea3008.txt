DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt you will soon hear of our misfortune on the 31st ultimo, and be very anxious to know our present situation. Our loss and repulse 
struck an amazing panic into both officers and men, and, had the enemy improved their advantage, our affairs here must have been entirely ruined. It was 
not in my power to prevail on the officers to attempt saving our mortars, which had been placed in St. lioque s. Of course they fell into the hands of the 
enemy. Upwards of one hundred officers and soldiers instantly set off for <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, and it was with the greatest difficulty I could persuade the rest to make a stand. 
</p><p>
The panic soon subsided. I arranged the men in 
such order, as effectually to blockade the city, and 
enable them to assist each other if attacked. It was 
urged, by the officers, to move our ammunition and 
artillery stores, of which we had a large quantity ; 
and, though the risk was great, I could not approve 
the measure, as it would undoubtedly have made unfavorable impressions on the minds of the Canadians, 
and induced them to withdraw their assistance, which 
must have ended in our utter ruin. I therefore put 
the best face on matters, and betrayed no marks of 
fear. I have withdrawn the cannon from our battery, 
and placed them round the magazine. 
</p><p>
Our present force is only seven hundred. I am in 
daily expectation of a reenforcement from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> 
of two or three hundred men. I expected <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a>, but find he cannot leave <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. Colonel Clinton is just arrived. I have put on foot the raising  a regiment of two or three hundred Canadians, 
which I make no doubt of effecting. Our finances 
are very low. However, I hope we shall be able to 
rub along. Mr. Price is our only resource, and has 
exerted himself. I wait with great anxiety the arrival of a reenforcement from below. I have wrote the 
Honorable Congress my opinion, that five thousand 
men will be necessary to insure us Quebec, though 
it may possibly be reduced with a less number; it 
appears a blockade may answer the purpose. I think 
Quebec an object of too much consequence to trust it 
to the event. If reduced, five thousand men will be 
necessary for a garrison. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 5th ultimo is just come to hand. 
It gives me a most sensible pleasure, to have your 
approbation of my conduct. I beg you would accept 
my thanks for the notice you have been pleased to 
take of me and my officers in your new establishment. Most of them are provided for in an unexpected manner, not very pleasing to me. Inclosed is 
a list of the killed and wounded. Both officers and 
men behaved with the greatest intrepidity, and had 
not the General been basely deserted by his troops, 
we should doubtless have carried the town. My detachment had carried the first battery. My being 
wounded, and the loss of their guides, retarded them 
much. After the death of the General, they sustained 
the force of the whole garrison for a considerable 
time, who fired from under cover, and had every 
advantage of situation. Their retreat was cut off by 
the enemy's gaining a narrow defile, through which 
they were obliged to pass. They were overpowered 
by numbers and obliged to resign, though deserving 
a better fate. Governor Carleton treats them with 
humanity, and has given leave fur their baggage to 
be sent in to them. 
</p><p>
I heartily congratulate you on the success of your 
privateers. I think the balance of the last year's 
account is still in our favor, though we have met a 
severe check here. I hope soon to have the pleasure 
of seeing General Lee, or some experienced officer, 
here. I heartily wish you the protection and blessing 
of the Almighty ; and am, with very great respect and 
esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
