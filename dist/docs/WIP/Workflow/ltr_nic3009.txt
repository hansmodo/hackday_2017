I have this moment received, by express, orders 
from the Honorable Continental Congress to despatch 
the two armed vessels belonging to the Colony, on a 
cruise after two brigs that sailed from England on 
the 11th of August last for Quebec, with six thou 
sand stand of arms, powder, &c. I think it my duty 
to inform your Excellency, that the large sloop hath 
not yet returned from her Bermuda expedition, and 
that the small one is unfit for service, unless it be 
in our rivers ; so that it is not in my power to 
take any measures for intercepting those vessels. I 
also give the same information to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a>. 
I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant,
