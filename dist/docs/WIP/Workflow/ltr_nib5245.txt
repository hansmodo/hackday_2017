Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have received your friendly letter of the 16th . inst for which I thank you. You ask my opinion about the fate of the 
Bank. I will tell you very frankly. I do not think this attack upon it will do any harm, &amp; I think it will rather benefit it. 
I think so for two reasons First, that the ground of the attack (its failure to produce a sound &amp; uniform currency) 
is well known by every man in the country to be unfounded, 
the currency issued by the Bank being more sound &amp; uniform than that of any country in the world at this moment. 
Second, the substitute proposed for it is one which no man 
who values the liberties of the country could agree to establish. These things will be perfectly understood before long, 
&amp; cannot fail to operate in favor of the Bank. I think therefore that the Stockholders need be under no uneasiness. The 
Bank is at this moment in a high state of prosperity, having during the last year divided 7 per cent, &amp; made all the proper 
reservations and still retaining a surplus profit out of the years work of $223,000. What other Bank has done the same?
