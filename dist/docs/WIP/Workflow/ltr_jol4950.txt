My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have received your kind favour of the 7th inst. 
accompanied by letters from Harry, and one from 
my wife. The former I send for your perusal ; the 
latter contained nothing new. 
</p><p>
Your letter to the general, and the copy of that to the commissioners Howe and Clinton, were dated May ; but the mistake I apprehend in the original is 
of no consequence. I cannot forbear expressing my joy that Congress has replied with so much dignity to the first overtures made to them. If they pursue 
the conduct which they have marked out to them 
selves in their letter, they will act with propriety. 
</p><p>
The insolence and infatuation of the British minister in sending commissioners to treat with America, 
under the act of Parliament which he pretends to call conciliatory, are without parallel. 
</p><p>
I hope Congress will not even suffer the secretary 
of the commission to wait upon them, nor do any 
thing that looks like listening to their proposals. 
Mr Boudinot, who returned this evening from conference with the British commissary of prisoners, 
informs us that the preparations for evacuating still 
continue, and that it is impossible for the enemy to 
remain much longer. He says he has reason to think 
that they will not march through the Jerseys, but proceed to a convenient place down the Delaware on the 
Jersey side, and there embark. This opinion has 
been suggested before, and seems to be favoured by 
a contradiction of a report which prevailed some time 
ago of the enemy's collecting boats in Princes bay. 
</p><p>
To-morrow the army will move to a camp about a 
mile in front of their present position. The unwhole 
some exhalations from the ground which we occupy 
has made this measure necessary. We shall be at 
hand to take possession of our field of battle, in case 
of any forward move on the part of the enemy. And 
while we are condemned to inactivity, we shall not 
swallow the effluvia arising from a deposit of various 
carcases and filth accumulated during six months. 
</p><p>
I am much concerned that you are afflicted with 
any bodily pain. You do not mention what it is ; I 
apprehend a return of your gout. Surely if ever a 
citizen deserved well of his country, you do ; but your 
continued sacrifice of yourself will find its reward in 
the triumph of liberty. 
</p><p>
God grant that your health of body may speedily 
be restored, and equal your health of mind. 
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>

Doctor Ferguson, sec y to the commission, was tutor 
to L'd Chesterfield at Geneva, where I became acquainted with him. He is a man known in the 
literary world, and whose profound knowledge makes 
him very respectable.
