Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... I have observed with great interest what you have 
written on the subject of the Bank. The truth is, that the 
question is no longer between this Bank &amp; no Bank. It is a 
mere contest between <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr. Van Buren's</a> Government Bank 
and the present institution between Chestnut St and 
Wall St between a Faro Bank and a National Bank. 
You do not perhaps know that soon after these people came 
into power, there was a deliberation in Caucus of the most 
active of the Jackson Party as to the means of sustaining 
themselves in place and the possession of the Bank was 
ranked as a primary object. For this purpose they began in 
<a href='/results.php?year=1829'>1829</a> with an effort to remove an obnoxious President of one 
of the Branches which was to be followed by a systematic 
substitution of their creatures throughout the whole insti 
tution. This experiment failed, owing to the firmness of thev 
Directors who determined that they would not permit the \ 
interference of the Executive Officers. . . . From that moment 
they despared of turning the Bank to their political purposes, 
and have been intent on breaking it down to substitute some 
machinery more flexible. To that spirit, a new impulse has 
been given by a coterie of gamblers who having ascertained the views of the Executive before the last session of Congress 
and believing that they must be fatal to the Bank, made large 
contracts on time. These executive denunciations not hav 
ing sufficiently lowered the stock to render the speculations 
safe or profitable, the parties are now endeavoring to force 
the Executive into the withdrawal of the public deposits, as 
a measure that would cover their retreat. This combination 
of political gamblers and gambling politicians is the key to 
the whole history of the relations between the Bank &amp; the 
executive. Against that coalition, all honest men should exert 
themselves. I am extremely gratified therefore at the opening 
of that battery of yours, and shall be very glad to supply you 
with all the ammunition in my power. . . .
