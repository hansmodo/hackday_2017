[Hamilton, who had proceeded to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, after his return 
from Newport, anxious to take part in the interesting operations which were about to occur, finding his application 
for a command unattended to, determined to bring the question to a definitive issue. The following extract from a letter written to Mrs. Hamilton, gives the course of this affair, ]

Camp, near <a href='/results.php?city=dobbs ferry' rel='city origin'>Dobbs' Ferry</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="7">July</a> <a rel="day origin" value="10">10th</a>, <a href="/results.php?year=1781" rel="origin">1781</a>.

The day before yesterday I arrived here, but for want 
of an opportunity could not write any sooner ; indeed, I 
know of none now. Finding, when I came here, that nothing was said on the subject of a command, I wrote the 
General a letter, and enclosed him my commission. This 
morning Tilghman came to me in his name, pressed me to 
retain my commission, with an assurance that he would endeavour, by all means, to give me a command, nearly such 
as I could have desired in the present circumstances of the 
army. Though I know you would be happy to hear I had 
rejected this proposal, it is a pleasure my reputation would 
not permit me to afford you. I consented to retain my 
commission, and accept the command. I quarter, at present, 
by a very polite and warm invitation, with <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a>, 
and experience from the officers of both armies every mark of esteem."
