My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I had the pleasure of writing to you on the fourth of 
January by our friend, Mr Short, I am without any of your 
letters. I lament this, because they always communicate to 
me both pleasure and instruction, 
</p><p>
As far as I can judge, this nation approaches to the point 
where the vigor of laws must supply the place of enthusiastic 
zeal, for this latter begins to abate. There will, however, be 
enough to furnish out a considerable force, when the weather 
grows a little warmer, especially should events somewhat distant, and rather untoward, require great exertion. Another 
supposition, (for I do not here notice that continuation of vic 
tories which people can easily reconcile themselves to,) another 
supposition is a heavy reverse at a distant point. Now the 
effect of this would, I think, be various, according to the nature of the calamity. If for instance the enemy should strike 
a blow, it would probably rouse the nation into effort. If a 
great project should fail, it would probably spread despondency. 
</p><p>
So much for calculation, which after all must depend on 
some moral causes, which neither France nor the Allies seem 
sufficiently to estimate, but which with me have very great 
weight. I believe it more easy to conquer by laws than by 
arms ; and had I been counsellor to the Duke of Brunswick 
and Company, I would have repeated to hid from Shakspeare, 
that when lenity and cruelty play for kingdoms, the gentlest 
gamester is the surest winner. And so, my dear old friend, 
adieu. Reproach yourself sometimes for not writing often, 
and always believe me with truth and affection yours, &c.
