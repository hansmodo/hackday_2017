An half hour since brought me the pleasure of your letter of December last. It went to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> and came from 
thence to this place. I heartily felicitate you on the birth 
of your daughter. I can well conceive your happiness upon 
that occasion, by that which I feel on a similar one. 
</p><p>
Indeed, the sensations of a tender father of the child of a 
beloved mother, can only be conceived by those who have 
experienced them. 
</p><p>
Your heart, my Meade, is peculiarly formed for enjoyments of this kind. You have every right to be a happy 
husband, a happy father. You have every prospect of being so. I hope your felicity may never be interrupted. 
</p><p>
You cannot imagine how entirely domestic I am growing. I lose all taste for the pursuits of ambition. I sigh 
for nothing but the company of my wife and my baby. The 
ties of duty alone, or imagined duty, keep me from renouncing public life altogether. It is, however, probable, I may 
not be any longer actively engaged in it. 
</p><p>
I have explained to you the difficulties which I met with 
in obtaining a command last campaign. I thought it incompatible with the delicacy due to myself to make any 
application this campaign. I have expressed this sentiment in a letter to the General, and, retaining my rank only, 
have relinquished the emoluments of my commission, declaring myself, notwithstanding, ready at all times to obey 
the calls of the public. I do not expect to hear any of 
these, unless the state of our affairs should change for the 
worse, and lest, by any unforeseen accident that should 
happen, I choose to keep myself in a situation again to contribute my aid. This prevents a total resignation. 
</p><p>
You were right in supposing I neglected to prepare what 
I promised you. at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. The truth is, I was in 
such a hurry to get home, that I could think of nothing else. 
As I set out to-morrow morning for <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I cannot, 
from this place, send you the matter you wish. 
</p><p>
Imagine, my dear Meade, what pleasure it must give 
Eliza and myself to know that Mrs. Meade interests herself 
in us. Without a personal acquaintance, we have been 
long attached to her. My visit at Mr. Fitzhugh's confirmed 
my partiality. Betsey is so fond of your family, that she 
proposes to form a match between her boy and your girl, 
provided you will engage to make the latter as amiable as 
her mother. 
</p><p>
Truly, my dear Meade, I often regret that fortune has 
cast our residence at such a distance from each other. It 
would be a serious addition to my happiness if we lived 
where I could see you every day ; but fate has determined 
it otherwise. I am a little hurried, and can only request, 
in addition, that you will present me most affectionately to 
Mrs. Meade, and believe me to be, with the warmest and 
most unalterable friendship, 
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
