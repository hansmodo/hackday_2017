SIR, 
</p><p>
It is difficult to console one's self for the obstacles, 
as numerous as insurmountable, which stopped me at 
Sandy Hook. The importance of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the happiness of fighting the English fleet, and the extreme 
satisfaction of acting directly with you, made me desire, with the greatest ardor, the possibility of entering. I offered, to too little purpose, in an assembly 
of your experienced pilots, a recompense of fifty 
thousand crowns to him who should find us a sufficiency of water. It is only by action that my regret 
can be diminished, and as yet we do nothing. Your foresight and your orders have, nevertheless, anticipated my wants, and rendered my delays less long. 
The re enforcement you have so properly sent, will, as 
I am informed, arrive this evening, and it will, most 
assuredly, be on the part you have so wisely and expeditiously taken, that our success will depend. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague met'>General Sullivan</a> has done me the honor to come 
and see me, and to communicate his views. I will 
second them with all my power. He is full of that 
spirit of activity and combination, with which you 
inspire all those who have served under your orders. 
I believe him as fully persuaded as I am of the necessity of acting. The intrenchments that are visible 
above Connanicut increase daily. They are numerous. 
The time I have been at sea begins to make me lose a number of men with the scurvy. The extreme 
difficulty of procuring water at Shrewsbury, and the 
tardiness with which it is collected here from different places, have long since obliged me to retrench 
our allowance. The officers and men support this terrible privation with courage and patience ; and we 
have acquired a virtue which has, hitherto, been re 
fused us, the virtue of perseverance. We doubtless 
owe it to the flattering hope of being useful to allies, 
whom our national taste had itself given us, before 
the orders of the King had prescribed it. 
</p><p>
The gentlemen, your Generals, will acquit them 
selves better than I of the duty of rendering you an 
account of the certain state of the preparations going 
on, and of the small burning of three English vessels, 
which guarded the eastern channel. I will confine myself by repeating to you, what I cannot well describe, the zeal and the infinite pains of Lieutenant <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>. He is on the wing the four-and-twenty hours round, to procure us refreshments and, 
when this is done, remains on board during a very 
long day with all the patience of an old sailor. We 
are indebted to him for a hospital established on 
shore, and for disembarrassing us of our prisoners; 
which, in our situation, form two important articles. 
</p><p>
I desire much that the present expedition may be 
speedily terminated, to give me leisure to employ 
myself with purging the Sound of the English vessels which now infest the navigation. I have received Colonel Sears with all the consideration and all 
the confidence which those merit whom you are pleased to send me, and, when it shall be time for it, 
I will consult him with the greatest eagerness. Accept the homage of the attachment and respect, with 
which I have the honor to be, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=cde" rel="me">ESTAING</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing my letter, I received that 
which you had the goodness to address me, on the 
26th of July, by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>Major-General Greene</a>. I am going 
to look for him on shore, that he may not lose any 
of the present precious moments. The reputation of 
this General Officer made his arrival to be wished. 
His influence on his countrymen, and his knowledge 
of the country, will render him formidable to our common enemy. You know how to divine whatever 
we stand in need of; and, from what I have seen, 
the discerning and employing men proper to the business in hand, seems to be one of the qualities which 
compose the illustrious character you bear. This is, 
perhaps, the most important part of the great General.
