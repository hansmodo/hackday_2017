SIR : I received your Favour of the 3oth of April a few 
Days since, with the Newspapers, etc., and am much obliged 
by the Information you as a private Person so kindly give me 
of the present state of Affairs in your Province. Such a confidential Correspondence between us I most willingly embrace, 
as I am persuaded it must be often useful in the prudent conduct of our publick interests to interchange Intelligence that 
cannot so properly or safely appear in Publick Letters, since 
nothing written to or from an Assembly can be kept from the 
Knowledge of Adversaries, who may take Advantage of it, 
to the Prejudice of our Affairs and of the Persons concerned 
in the Management of them. 
</p><p>
The continuing our General Court at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> has always 
appeared to me a Measure extreamly impolitic in Government here, as it can tend only to irritate the Members, offend 
the People in general, and create an ill-humour that can never 
be for his Majesty's Service or the Benefit of this Nation. 
For supposing the Province to be ever so great an Offender, 
this is not a Punishment sufficient to reform by its severity ; 
it is rather more fitted to affront and provoke. You will 
therefore hardly understand it, if you do not well know the 
Character of the present American Secretary, proud, supercilious, extreamly conceited, moderate as they are, of his 
political knowledge and Abilities, fond of every one that can 
stoop to flatter him, and inimical to all that dare tell him disagreable Truths. This Man's Mandates have been treated 
with Disrespect in America, his Letters have been criticised, 
his Measures censur'd and despis'd; which has produced 
in him a kind of settled Malice against the Colonies, particularly ours, that would break out into greater Violence if 
cooler Heads did not set some Bounds to it. I have indeed 
good Reason to believe that his Conduct is far from being 
approved by the King's other Servants, and that he himself 
is so generally dislik'd by them that it is not probable he 
will continue much longer in his present Station, the general Wish here being to recover (saving only the Dignity of Government) the Good- Will of the Colonies, which there is little 
reason to expect while they are under his wild Administration. Their permitting so long his Eccentricities (if I may 
use such an Expression) is owing, I imagine, rather to the 
Difficulty of knowing how to dispose of or what to do with a 
man of his wrong-headed bustling Industry, who, it is apprehended, may be more mischievous out of Administration than 
in it, than to any kind of personal Regard for him. 
</p><p>
All Views or Expectations of drawing any considerable 
Revenue to this Country from the Colonies are, I believe, 
generally given over, and it seems probable that nothing 
of that kind will ever again be attempted. But as Foreign 
Courts appear to have taken great Pleasure in the Prospect 
of our Disunion, it seems now to be thought necessary for 
supporting the National Weight and the Influence of our 
Court abroad, that there should be an Appearance as if all 
was pacified in America; and, as I said before, I think the 
general Wish is that it may be really so. But then there is 
an Apprehension lest a too sudden yielding to all our Claims 
should be deem'd the Effect of Weakness, render the British 
Court contemptible in the Eyes of Foreigners ; make us more 
presumptuous, and promote more extravagant Demands 
such as could never be granted, and thence still greater 
Danger of a fatal Rupture. I am thus particular, that you 
may judge whether it will not be prudent in us to indulge 
the Mother Country in this Concern for her own Honour, 
so far as may be consistent with the Preservation of our essential Rights, especially as that Honour may in some Cases be 
of Importance to the General Welfare. And in this View, 
whether it will not be better gradually to wear off the assum'd 
Authority of Parliament over America, which we have in 
too many Instances given countenance to, with our indiscrete 
Acknowledgment of it in Publick Acts, than by a General open Denial and Resistance to it, bring on prematurely a 
Contest to which, if we are not found equal, that Authority 
will by the Event be more strongly establish'd; and if we 
should prove superior, yet by the Division, the general strength 
of the British Nation must be greatly diminished. I do not 
venture to advise in this Case, because I see in this seemingly 
prudent Course some Danger of a diminishing Attention to 
our Rights, instead of a persevering Endeavor to recover 
and establish them; but I rely a good deal on the growing 
Knowledge of them among the Americans, and the daily 
increasing Strength and Importance of that Country to this, 
which must give such Weight in time to our just Claims 
as no selfish Spirit in this Part of the Empire will be able to 
resist. In the meantime, while we are declining the usurped 
Authority of Parliament, I wish to see a steady dutiful Attachment to the King and his Family maintained among us; 
and that however we may be induced for Peace-sake, or from 
a Sense of our present Inability, to submit at present in some 
Instances to the Exercise of that unjust Authority, we shall 
continue from time to time to assert our Rights in occasional 
solemn Resolves and other publick Acts, never yielding them 
up, and avoiding even the slightest Expressions that seem 
confirmatory of the Claim that has been set up against them. 
My Opinion has long been that Parliament had originally 
no Right to bind us by any kind of Law whatever without our 
Consent. We have indeed in a manner consented to some of 
them, at least tacitly. But for the future methinks we should 
be cautious how we add to those Instances, and never adopt or acknowledge an Act of Parliament but by a formal Law 
of our own, as your General Assembly I think did in the case 
of the Act of Parliament relating to the Oaths mention' d 
in the first Paragraph of your Votes ; tho' as it stands there, 
it seems as if the Act of Parliament had required those 
Oaths to be taken by your Members, and was acknowledged 
as of force for that purpose. 
</p><p>
I do not at present see the least likelihood of preventing 
the Grant of Salaries or Pensions from hence to the King's 
Officers in America, by any Application in Behalf of the 
People there. It is look'd on as a strange thing here to object to the King's paying his own servants sent among us to 
do his Business ; and they say we would seem to have much 
more Reason of Complaint if it were requir'd of us to pay 
them. And the more we urge the Impropriety of their not 
depending on us for their Support, the more Suspicion it 
breeds that we are desirous of influencing them to betray 
the Interests of their Master or of ;his Nation. Indeed if 
the money is rais'd from among us against our Wills, the 
Injustice becomes more evident than where it arises from 
hence. I do not think, however, that the Effect of these 
Salaries is likely to be so considerable, either in favour of Government here, or in our Prejudice, as may be generally apprehended. The Love of Money is not a Thing of certain 
Measure, so as that it may be easily filled and satisfied. 
Avarice is infinite ; and where there is not good (Economy, 
no Salary, however large, will prevent Necessity. He that 
has a fixed and what others may think a competent Income, 
is often as much to be byassed by the Expectation of more, 
as if he had already none at all. If the Colonies should resolve on giving handsome Presents to good Governors at or 
after their Departure, or to their Children after their Decease, 
I imagine it might produce even better Effects than our present annual Grants. But the Course probably will soon be 
that the Chief Governor, to whom the Salary is given, will 
have leave to reside in England; a Lieutenant or Deputy 
will be left to do the Business and live on the Perquisites, 
which not being thought quite sufficient, his receiving Presents yearly will be wink'd at through the Interest of his Principal; and thus things will get into the old Train, only this 
Inconvenience remaining, that while by our Folly in consuming the Duty-Articles the fixed Salary is raised on ourselves 
without our Consent, we must pay double for the same Service. However, tho' it may be a hopeless Task while the 
Duties continue sufficient to pay the Salaries, I shall on all 
proper Occasions make Representations against this new 
Mode ; and if by the Duties falling short the Treasury should 
be calPd on to pay those Salaries, it is possible they may come 
to be seen in another Light than at present, and dropt as unnecessary. 
</p><p>
I was glad to see that Attention in the general Court to the 
Improvement of the Militia. A War may happen in which 
Britain, like Rome of old, may find so much to do for her own 
Defence as to be unable to spare Troops or Ships for the Protection of her Colonies. A Minister may arise so little our 
Friend as to neglect that Protection, or to permit Invasions 
of our Country, in order to make us cry out for Help, and 
thereby furnish stronger Pretence for maintaining a standing 
Army among us. If we once lose our military Spirit and 
supinely depend on an Army of Mercenaries for our Defence, 
we shall become contemptible ; despis'd both by Friends and 
Enemies, as neither our Friendship nor our Enmity will be 
deem'd of any Importance. As our Country is not wealthy 
so as to afford much ready Plunder, the Temptation to a 
foreign Invasion of us is the less, and I am persuaded that the 
Name of a numerous well-disciplined Militia, would alone be 
almost sufficient to prevent any Thoughts of attempting it. 
And what a Glory would it be for us to send, on any trying 
Occasion, ready and effectual Aid to our Mother Country ! 
</p><p>
I have lately been among the Clothing Towns in Yorkshire, and by conversing with the Manufacturers there, am 
more and more convinced of the natural Impossibility there 
is that, considering our Increase in America, England should 
be able much longer to supply us with Cloathing. Necessity, 
therefore, as well as Prudence, will soon induce us to seek 
Resources in our own Industry, which becoming General among the People, encouraged by resolutions of your Court, 
such as I have the Pleasure of seeing in your late Votes, will 
do Wonders. Family Manufactures will alone amount to a 
vast Saving in the Year; and a steady Determination and 
Custom of buying only of your own Artificers wherever they 
can supply you, will soon make them more expert in Working, 
so as to despatch more Business, while constant Employment 
enables them to afford their Work still cheaper. The lowness of Provisions with us, compared with their daily rising 
Price here, added to the Freight, Risque, and Commissions 
on the Manufactures of this Country, must give great Advantage to our Workmen, and enable them in time to retain 
a great deal of Money in the Country, tho' still Trade enough 
should remain between us and Britain to render our Friendship of the greatest Importance to this Nation.

I was a Subscriber to a Set of Plates published here, entitled The Senator's Remembrancer, a Work encouraged by 
many Members of both Houses. Having a spare Copy, I 
beg your Acceptance of it as a small Mark of my Respect, 
and send it by Captain Jarvis. Should it afford to your 
already well-furnished Mind no useful Hints in the Management of publick Affairs, it may however be of Service to some 
young Friend at least as Copies of fair and elegant Writing. 
</p><p>
The Letters I have received from my friends in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> have 
lately come to hand, badly sealed, with no distinct Impression, 
appearing as if they had been opened, and in a very bungling 
way closed again. I suspect this may be done by some prying 
Persons that use the Coffee-house here. I therefore mention 
it that you may, if you think fit, send yours under Cover to 
some Merchant of Character who would forward them to me 
more safely. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere respect, I have the honour of being, 
sir, your most obedient and most humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
