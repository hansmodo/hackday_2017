DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
Since my last, a long one, of March 13th, nothing has been 
talked or thought of here but elections. There have been 
amazing contests all over the kingdom, twenty or thirty thousand pounds of a side spent in several places, and inconceivable mischief done by debauching the people and making 
them idle, besides the immediate actual mischief done by 
drunken mad mobs to houses, windows, &c. The scenes 
have been horrible. London was illuminated two nights 
running at the command of the mob for the success of Wilkes, 
in the Middlesex election. The second night exceeded any 
thing of the kind ever seen here on the greatest occasions of 
rejoicing, as even the small cross-streets, lanes, courts, and 
other out-of-the-way places were all in a blaze with lights, 
and the principal streets all night long, as the mobs went 
round again after two o'clock, and obliged people who had 
extinguished their candles to light them again. Those who 
refused had all their windows destroyed. The damage done, 
and expense of candles, has been computed at fifty thousand 
pounds. It must have been great, though probably not so 
much.

The ferment is not yet over, for he has promised to surrender himself to the court next Wednesday, and another 
tumult is then expected ; and what the upshot will be no one 
can yet foresee. It is really an extraordinary event to see an 
outlaw and an exile, of bad personal character, not worth a 
farthing, come over from France, set himself up as candidate for the capital of the kingdom, miss his election only by 
being too late in his application, and immediately carrying it 
for the principal county; the mob (spirited up by numbers 
of different ballads sung or roared in every street) requiring 
gentlemen and ladies of all ranks, as they passed in their 
carriages, to shout for Wilkes and liberty, marking the same 
words on all their coaches with chalk, and No. 45 l on every 
door; which extends a vast way along the roads into the 
country. I went last week to Winchester, and observed, 
that for fifteen miles out of town there was scarce a door or 
window shutter next the road unmarked ; and this continued, 
here and there, quite to Winchester, which is sixty-four 
miles.

B. FRANKLIN.
