SIR, 
</p><p>
I am exceedingly mortified that you did not accept of my offer 
at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, to go to England in a vessel, that the State of Massachusetts Bay would, at my request, have provided. General 
Glover, with whom you are acquainted, was, in that case, to have 
attended you in his own ship ; and I am persuaded you would 
have avoided many disagreements, had it pleased you to have 
accepted that offer. Your case I feel, as I ever shall that of the 
unfortunate brave. If courage, perseverance, and a faithful attachment to your Prince could have prevailed, I might have been 
your prisoner. The chance of war has determined otherwise. 
</p><p>
The Congress now send the passports you desire ; and I am 
happy to acquaint you, that the Major and Lady Harriet Ackland 
are in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and may possibly be in England as soon as, 
or very soon after you. With respect, I am, Sir, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
