Dear General, 
</p><p>
This afternoon the intelligence, contained in the 
inclosed, came to hand; upon which <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a> immediately made a requisition for two thousand militia. I have called upon Governor Greene 
for fifteen hundred men, and on Brigadier Godfrey, 
of the brigade in the county of Bristol, Massachusetts, for eight hundred. <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a> says 
that in six days he shall be safe, without the assistance of the militia. I have written to the Council of 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, that, if their militia for reenforcing the army 
for three months are detached, and not marched, those 
from the counties of Suffolk, <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, Barnstable, 
and Bristol, may march to Tiverton, which will not 
be greatly out of their way to the place of their 
destination ; and, should Sir Henry Clinton be coming 
this way, they may answer a good purpose. It will also be less burdensome to the militia, who, after so 
great drafts as have been lately made, will think an 
additional one, in the midst of harvest, almost insurmountable. 
</p><p>
If Sir Henry should not come this way, there shall 
be no needless detention of any of the levies. The 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> is in sentiment with me in this 
particular. I hope it will not be disagreeable to your 
Excellency. It cannot, at any rate, make a detention 
of more than five or six days. It is with pain that 
I call on the militia to turn out; but <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a> is so pressing in his application, that he 
cannot be denied. Indeed, if Sir Henry, Clinton has 
a land force to spare from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, adequate to 
the enterprise, I think he never had a more inviting 
object than the present situation and circumstances 
of things offer him here. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wih" rel="me">William Heath</a> 
</p><p>
P. S. The article of bread will be obtained, I fear, 
with much difficulty, for the troops that will assemble here.
