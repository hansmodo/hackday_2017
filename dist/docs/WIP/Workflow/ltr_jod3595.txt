MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE President's speech is so important to the public, 
that I know you will be anxious to see it as early as 
possible. When the answers of the two Houses come 
to be debated, we shall see whether there are any 
apologists for rebellion in these sanctuaries. 
</p><p>
As Mr. Edwards of Kentucky appeared in Senate 
to-day, we can do business if one member should be 
sick, but it will be very inconvenient to have so small 
a majority. Mr. Potts of Maryland, and Mr. Taylor 
of Virginia have resigned. The Senate seems really 
to be too small a body for so important a branch of 
the legislature of so great a people. 
</p><p>
I feel, where I am, the want of the society of Mr. O.'s family, but much more that of my own. I pore 
upon my family at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, my children in Europe, 
and my children and grandchildren in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, till 
I am melancholy, and wish myself a private man. 
That event, however, would not relieve me, for my 
thoughts would be at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> and at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, if 
I was at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. Your meditations cannot be more 
cheerful than mine, and your visit to our afflicted sister will not, I fear, brighten your views or soften your 
anxiety. I hope we shall be supported, but there is 
no plan that occurs to me, that can relieve us from 
our solicitude. We must repose ourselves upon those 
principles in which we were educated, and which, I 
hope, we have never renounced nor relinquished. 
</p><p>
I would resign my office and remain with you, or I 
would bring you next winter with me, but either of 
these plans, the public out of the question, would in 
crease our difficulties, perhaps, rather than lessen 
them. This climate is disease to me, and I greatly 
fear would be worse to you, in the present state of 
your health. Mrs. Jay, poor lady, is more distressed 
than we are. I pray you to take care of your health 
and of L's too. She is a good girl : but I sometimes 
wish she would run about a little more, if it was even 
to look at the young men. 
</p><p>
Adieu, 
</p><p>
