SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letters of the 30th of November, and of the 4th, 7th, and 11th of December, being duly received, 
were laid before Congress. To prevent the ill consequences that might ensue from the backwardness of 
the men, in the present service, to reenlist, the Congress, as I informed you in my last, have written to 
the Governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, the Council of Massachusetts Bay, and the President of 
the Convention of New Hampshire. In consequence of which letters, they have strong hopes and confidence that measures will be taken to complete your 
army. As to the article of butter, the Congress, desirous to obviate whatever may have a " tendency to 
give the soldiery room for complaint," have instructed me to inform you, that the same may be continued until further order. 
</p><p>
The Congress receive, with great satisfaction, your congratulations on the success of Captain Manly. By the inclosed resolves, you will perceive their determination on the captures already made, as well as those which may be made hereafter. It is expected the several Colonies will erect Courts of Admiralty, 
and that the Judges in those courts will regulate their decisions by the law of nations, except where it is relaxed by the inclosed resolutions. 
</p><p>
I am further directed to inform you, that the Congress approve your taking such of the articles, found 
on board the <a href='/results.php?city=concord' rel='city'>Concord</a>, as are necessary for the army. The necessity of the case will, they apprehend, justify the measure, even though the vessel upon trial 
should, contrary to their expectation, be acquitted. 
</p><p>
I am authorized to inform you, that it is the pleasure of Congress that Mr. Mifflin, the Quartermaster-General, hold the rank of Colonel in the Army of 
the United Colonies, and that you establish his rank accordingly. 
</p><p>
I must beg leave to refer you to the inclosed resolutions of Congress for your future proceedings, 
which I am directed to transmit to you. You will 
notice the last resolution relative to an attack upon 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This passed, after a most serious debate, in 
a Committee of the whole House, and the execution 
was referred to you ; and may God crown your attempt with success. I most heartily wish it, though 
individually I may be the greatest sufferer. 
</p><p>
I have paid Mr. Fessenden, the express, in full for 
his three journeys as express to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, deducting  only sixty dollars, which he says you ordered 
him ; so that there will be no pay due to him for 
services performed heretofore, only for his expenses 
now from this place to you. If this adjustment be 
not right, please to inform me. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sincere sentiments of 
esteem, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. Fessenden being indisposed, I have sent a 
special express, as Congress were anxious their resolves 
should reach you as quick as possible. 
</p>
