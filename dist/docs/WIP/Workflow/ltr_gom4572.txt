Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Herewith you have a copy of what I had the honor to write on the twenty-third of last month. Since that period, there 
are advices here, which announce the re-establishment of the King of Great Britain's health ; but from a letter I have just 
now received from the Marquis de la Luzerne, I am disposed to doubt the fact.

The other day I saw the Due de Castries, who served in 
America under the title of the Comte de Charlu. He desired 
to be remembered to you, and so did General Duplessis,j &gt; who 
has been promoted lately. Our friend, the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, is now in Auvergne attending his election. This coun 
try presents an astonishing spectacle to one, who has collected 
his ideas from books and information half a dozen years old. 
Everything is a P Anglais, and a desire to imitate the English 
prevails alike in the cut of a coat, and the form of a constitution. Like the English, too, all are engaged in parliamenteering ; and when we consider how novel this last business must 
be, I assure you their progress is far from contemptible.

Poor General Chastellux is no more. I have seen his widow, an amiable woman, who is not the less lovely for the tears she sheds to his memory. A fine boy remains as the 
pledge of connubial tenderness. I think it would give her great pleasure, if you took the trouble to mingle in a short letter condolence for one event, and congratulations for the other. You 
would in that case oblige me by confiding the letter to my care. Excuse me, I pray, for dropping this hint, and do me the justice to believe, that with sincere esteem and respect I am yours,
