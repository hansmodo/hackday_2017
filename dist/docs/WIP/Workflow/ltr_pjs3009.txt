DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
At two, this afternoon, an express from General 
Montgomery arrived at this place. Copy of his 
letter, with copies of the papers it inclosed, I do 
myself the honor to transmit your Excellency by express. The irresistible force of necessity having 
drove us to arms, success cannot be attended without 
pleasure ; and, therefore, I congratulate your Excellency on the good account these papers contain. 
The reduction of Chamblee will, in all probability, be followed by that of St. John's, especially as <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> has now a supply of powder, of which 
he stood in such need, that a very few days more would have expended his all. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency that I should not .send 
on <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a> ; but, as his regiment refused to 
go without him, I was obliged to suffer him to go. 
But, lest any detriment should accrue to the service, 
I thought it proper to write him a letter, of which I 
inclose a copy, as also a copy of his answer. 
</p><p>
I am in hopes that the next accounts I receive 
will announce the arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a> (whose 
success seems now certain), and the reduction of St. 
John s. I have requested <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> to 
send me an express, as soon as he receives any 
certain intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a>. As I can 
easily conceive that your Excellency's anxiety must 
be extreme, I shall forward what intelligence I receive by express. The great dread I was in, lest we 
should suffer for provisions, induced me to have all 
brought up that could be got; and it was very lucky, 
as the late heavy rains have carried away almost all 
the bridges between Fort George and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and 
rendered the roads impassable, in which state they 
will continue at least a week hence. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, with the best wishes for your health, 
your happiness, and prosperity, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
