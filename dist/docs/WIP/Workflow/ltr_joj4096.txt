Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
During your absence from France, I omitted being so 
regular in my correspondence as I should otherwise have 
been. I have been honoured with your letters of the 18th 
April, and 6th September in the last year, and with one of 
11th February last. They were all communicated to Congress. 
</p><p>
The account of your German excursion is concise and 
interesting. The sentiments and opinions respecting the 
United States and American affairs, which you found there 
prevailing, appear to me very natural. Successful revolutions and victorious arms have always a degree of splendour 
about them, which shines at a great distance, and excites 
admiration, whether well or ill founded. Few have been 
at the pains of examining and understanding the merits of 
the case between Great Britain and us, and nine-tenths of 
that few have taken their sides less from conviction and 
opinion of right, than from some of the many other more 
common and more stimulating motives, which usually govern the declarations and conduct of the mass of mankind. 
It is equally natural that reports to our disadvantage, composed of such proportions of truth and falsehood as might 
render them probable and palatable, should be generally 
diffused and believed. There are very few States, and 
very few ministers in them, who think it convenient to 
magnify America either by word or deed. Politicians, like 
critics, are often more disposed to censure than to commend the works of others, and patriotic manoeuvres pro 
bono publico, like pious frauds pro salute animarum, were 
never uncommon. As there is, and always was, and will 
be, an actual though involuntary coalition between the men 
of too much art, and the men of too little; so they who 
either officially or from choice fabricate opinions for other 
people's use, will always find many to receive and be influenced by them. Thus, errors proceeding from the invention of designing men, are very frequently adopted and 
cherished by others who mistake them for truths. It must 
be easy for the maritime nations to make the rest of Europe 
believe almost what they please of this country for some 
years yet to come, and I shall be much mistaken if fame 
should soon do us justice, especially as her trumpet is, in 
many places, employed and hired for other purposes. 
</p><p>
Whence it happens, I know not, but so the fact is, that I 
have scarcely met with six foreigners in the course of my 
life, who really understood American affairs. The cause 
of truth will probably be little indebted to their memoirs 
and representations ; and when I consider what mistakes arc committed by writers on American subjects, I 
suspect the histories of other countries contain but very 
imperfect accounts of them. 
</p><p>
I can easily conceive that, at the German courts you 
visited, you have done us service ; because I know how 
able, as well as how willing, you are to do it. I wish all 
who speak and write of us were equally well-informed and 
well-disposed. It is a common remark in this country, 
that wherever you go, you do us good. For my part, I 
give you credit, not merely for doing us good, but also for 
doing it uniformly, constantly, and upon system. 
</p><p>
Do you recollect your letter of the 2d March, <a href='/results.php?year=1783'>1783</a>, containing what passed between you and Count de Florida 
Blanca, respecting our western limits? I communicated 
that part of it some months ago to Mr. Gardoqui, in opposition to his pretensions and claims. He lately told me 
you had mistaken the count, for that he never meant to convey to you any thing like a dereliction of those claims : 
which, by-the-bye, are too extensive to be admitted. In a 
word, they do not mean to be restricted to the limits established between Britain and us. Why should people, who 
have so much more territory than they know what to do 
with, he so solicitous to acquire more? 
</p><p>
The moneys due by the United States to subjects of 
France have given occasion to applications by Mr. Marbois, and to reports on them by the board of treasury, 
which are now under the consideration of Congress. You, 
my dear sir, are not unacquainted with the state of our 
finances, nor with the difficulties resulting from the inefficiency of our federal government. Time and more experience must and will cure these evils; when or how is less 
certain, and can only be conjectured. 
</p><p>
I had the honour, last summer, of writing a letter to the 
marchioness, in answer to one she was so obliging as to 
favour me with ; did it ever come to hand? Mrs. Jay 
writes to her by this conveyance. We and many others 
are pleased with the expectation of seeing you both here, 
and with the opportunity we shall then have of personally 
assuring you of our esteem and attachment. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your all'ectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
