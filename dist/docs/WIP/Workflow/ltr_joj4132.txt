Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
After considering all that I have heard and seen on the 
subject, it is my opinion that the common and popular (not 
official) language of America, relative to Great Britain, 
manifested such a disposition as to create serious apprehensions in this country that we should join with the French 
in the war ; that these apprehensions gave occasion to 
secret designs, calculated on such an event ; that in proportion as your views and counsels became developed, 
these apprehensions gradually subsided ; that my mission 
was regarded as a strong proof of your desire to preserve 
peace, and that the perfect and universal confidence reposed 
in your personal character, excluded every doubt of your 
being sincere ; and that this government is not yet entirely 
convinced that a pacific and conciliatory system will be 
supported by the inclination and correspondent conduct of 
the great body of the people. Various circumstances, 
however, induce me to believe, that the cabinet ultimately 
determined to give conciliation a fair experiment, by doing us substantial justice, and by consenting to such arrangements favourable to us, as the national interests and habitual 
prejudices would admit. To relax the navigation act was 
to alarm these prejudices, and therefore was a measure 
which required caution and circumspection, especially in 
the first instance. To break the ice was the difficulty. To 
enlarge the aperture afterward would be more easy ; and 
it will probably be done, if we should be reasonably temperate and prudent. To admit us into their East and West 
India dominions, and into all their continental American 
territories, under any modifications, were decided deviations 
from their former policy, and tended to shock ancient prejudices. Yet these things have been done. None but a 
strong administration would have ventured it. These are 
offerings to conciliation, and include, though not confessedly, 
satisfaction to our claims of justice. 
</p><p>
What passed at Paris on <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a>'s arrival, I am 
persuaded made a strong and disagreeable impression; and 
had not your private character prevented those transactions from being imputable in any degree to your orders, I 
do believe that the system of conciliation would have been 
instantly abandoned. 
</p><p>
What would have succeeded it cannot be easily conjectured ; certainly no treat}' so favourable to us as the present would then have been attainable. Whatever the 
American opinion of it may prove to be, the administration 
here think it very friendly to us ; and that it could not in 
the present moment have been made more so, without 
exciting great discontents and uneasiness in this country. 
</p><p>
The present situation of Great Britain may to us and 
others appear to be perilous, but the ministry seem to have 
no such fears. They have been uniformly bent on prosecuting the war with vigour, and since my arrival I have 
observed no change in that resolution. Even a distinguished leader in the opposition lately told me, that the 
French could not possibly injure the vitals of this country. 
Let it be infatuation or what it will, the government and 
the great majority of this nation meant and mean to continue tin 1 war. I will mention a striking anecdote. 
</p><p>
^i ou have doubtless heard that the merchants concerned 
in the American trade gave me a dinner. The principal 
cabinet ministers were present, and about two hundred merchants. Many toasts were given. "When the "President of 
the United States" was given, it was proposed to be with 
three cheers, but they were prolonged (as if by preconcert, 
but evidently not so) to six. Several other toasts passed 
with great acclamation, particularly " The wooden walls of 
Old England ;" almost every toast referable to America, and 
manifesting a desire of conciliation and cordiality, met with 
general and strong marks of approbation. Towards the 
conclusion of the feast, I was asked for a toast; I gave a 
neutral one, viz., "A safe and honourable peace to all the 
belligerent powers ;" you cannot conceive how coldly it 
was received, and though civility induced them to give it 
three cheers, yet they were so faint and single, as most 
decidedly to show that peace was not the thing they washed, 
— these were merchants. Mr. Pinckney was struck as 
forcibly by it as I was ; and we both drew the same conclusions from it. 
</p><p>
Except an inconsiderable number, the men of rank and 
property, and all whom they can influence throughout the 
kingdom, think the war is indispensable to their safety. 
The dread of Jacobin politics and Jacobin scenes, and the 
expectation that the pecuniary resources of this country 
will ultimately render them superior in the contest, appear 
to be their prevailing motives. 
</p><p>
It was expected by some, that the loss of Holland would 
have damped this spirit, it has had only a partial effect. 
We find the ministry and parliament have been stimulated 
by it to greater efforts. 
</p><p>
All the members who voted for what are called the pacific 
resolutions were not moved, as many of them certainlv 
were, by a mere desire of peace, but by the policy of professing a readiness to make peace, in order that, if spurned 
by the French, the nation might continue in the war with 
more constancy and unanimity. They did not suppose 
that an acceptable peace could, in the present moment, be 
obtained. 
</p><p>
This people appear to think their constitution, and property, and national character and importance as being all at 
stake, and on that stake to be inflexibly determined to risk 
every thing. 
</p><p>
Of the great number who advocated a reform in parliament, there is a portion (but how great cannot easily be 
ascertained) who are so sore, and mortified, and vexed, that 
in my opinion the French successes give them as much 
pleasure as pain. There are men among them whose designs 
as well as whose fortunes are desperate, as well as men 
who have honest designs and good fortunes. These people 
are at present kept from action by the energy of the government, and the unanimity of the great majority of the 
nation as to the necessity of the war. 
</p><p>
The French Jacobins have greatly injured the cause of 
rational liberty. The detestable massacres, impieties, and 
abominations imputable to them, excited in the people here 
the most decided hatred and abhorrence ; and the government by that circumstance rendered the war popular. But 
the system of moderation and justice lately adopted in 
France, the suppression of the Jacobins, and the strict discipline observed in their armies, will doubtless have an 
influence on the sentiments of this nation. I think I see 
traces of this influence already, on minds not suspected 
of it. 
</p><p>
The present war system, however, strikes me as being 
less firm, consolidated, and formidable than it appears to be. 
The administration has been composed more with a view 
to the conciliation of parties than the efficiency of measures. 
I think the system is liable to fluctuation and derangement ; 
from a variety of events and circumstances. Opposition 
to reform, as leading to innovations, is doubtless carried too 
far, and may produce serious consequences. Ideas of the 
rights of man, and the inferences deducible from them, are 
spreading among the people. Veneration for royalty, abstractedly considered, has abated; and although the king 
is popular, yet it is said that the Prince of Wales and the 
Duke of York are not. The prosperity of Britain results 
from, and depends on many causes : complicated machines 
are most liable to derangement. Should there be a scarcity 
of corn, want of employment to the manufacturers, or signal convulsions or disasters in the East or West Indies, or in 
Ireland, or on the sea, the government would find their task 
very arduous. Alarm and distress will abate pride and obstinacy; and when the multitude begin to feel severely, their 
passions frequently take a new and dangerous direction. 
</p><p>
The minister would, I think, have stood on stronger 
ground, if he had taken the first good opportunity of saying explicitly in the House of Commons, that it was France 
who declared war against Great Britain, and not Great 
Britain against France ; and that the government was disposed and ready to make peace whenever France would do 
it on terms compatible with honour and the essential interests 
of Great Britain. To put an enemy in the wrong is to obtain great advantages. The placing and so long continuing 
Lord Chatham at the head of the admiralty — the putting 
the Duke of York at the head of the army — the improper 
liberties taken with neutral nations, for which the Danes 
and Swedes on their part are not yet satisfied — the strange 
measures relative to Ireland, and many other things which 
strike me as blunders, indicate a defect either in the cabinet 
or in the minister. Although united as to the war, yet as 
to the mode of conducting it, the wisest counsels may not 
always prevail. Upon the whole, I shall be surprised if in 
the course of this war, Britain does not reap more thorns 
than laurels, 
</p><p>
I have great reason to believe that the king, the cabinet, 
and nation were never more unanimous in any system than 
in that of conciliation with us ; even Lord Hawkesbury 
does not oppose it. If it should not succeed, they will 
naturally pass, like a pendulum, to the other extreme. 
</p><p>
This system rests principally on their confidence in the 
uprightness, independence, and wisdom of your conduct. 
No other man enjoys so completely the esteem and confidence of this nation as you do ; nor, except the king, is 
any one so popular. The idea which everywhere prevails 
is, that the quarrel between Britain and America w T as a 
family quarrel, and that it is time it should be made up. 
For my part, I am for making it up, and for cherishing this 
disposition on their part by justice, benevolence, and good 
manners on ours. To cast ourselves into the arms of this 
or any other nation would be degrading, injurious, and 
puerile : nor, in my opinion, ought we to have any political 
connexion with any foreign power. 
</p><p>
Before I came here, I had no idea that the king was so 
popular as he is ; his reign having been marked by national 
calamities produced by reprehensible measures. But his 
popularity is owing to his private, rather than his official 
character. As a man, there is much in him to commend ; 
and I have not heard any vice imputed to him. As a 
domestic man, affectionate and attentive to his queen and 
children, and affable to all about him, he is universally 
esteemed. Few men are so punctual in all things. He 
patronizes the arts and sciences. He pays uncommon 
attention to agriculture, and delights in his farms. He lays 
out about ten thousand pounds a-year in improving and 
embellishing the royal estates. He is industrious, sober, 
and temperate, and has acquired much various knowledge 
and information. He converses with ease, and often with 
adroitness, and has an uncommon memory ; they who 
ought to know him concur in these accounts. That he is a 
great and a wise king, I have not heard asserted. That he 
does (to use a vulgar expression) as well as lie knows how, 
seems not to be doubted; but yet some say, that he occasionally is cunning instead of being wise. I have heard 
him described as being a great man in little things ; and 
as being generally well-intentioned, pertinacious, and persevering. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you and our country on the bloodless issue 
of the insurrection ; it is very reputable to the government, 
and to the people ; and exalts both in the estimation of this 
and other nations. 
</p><p>
The tranquillity of the present session of Congress is 
a pleasing circumstance ; but I suspect it has proceeded 
more from their having nothing to differ about, than from a 
spirit of forbearance, or a desire of unanimity. The result 
of my negotiations will doubtless produce fresh disputes, 
and give occasion to much declamation ; for / have no idea 
that the treaty will meet with anti-federal approbation. 
Besides, men are more apt to think of what they wish to 
have, than of what is in their power to obtain. How far 
the rejection of such a treaty would put the United States 
in the wrong ; whether it is consistent with our honour, 
engagements, and important interests ; whether it is 
preferable upon the whole to a war ; are questions which 
require much cool and deliberate consideration, as well as 
more information than many who will decide upon them 
possess. I regret not having had time to make my letter, 
which accompanied the treaty, more full, so as to have particularized and explained the reasons which relate to the 
several articles in it. Then I had not leisure ; to have 
done it since would have been too late, as the fate of the 
treaty would probably be decided before subsequent letters 
could arrive. I still have thoughts of reducing them to 
writing ; and yet there are some among them which should 
not be published, lest the future measures, which they also 
respect, should be thereby marred. I allude, for instance, 
to the free navigation of the St. Lawrence. 
</p><p>
Mr. Randolph does not see the West India article in the 
same light that I do: it breaks the ice, that is, it breaks in 
upon the navigation act. The least stream from a mass 
oi' water passing through a bank will enlarge its passage. 
The very article stipulates that the arrangements to succeed it shall have in view the further extension of commerce. This should not be too nicely discussed in American or English newspapers; for though liberal and enlightened people will admit such extensions of commerce to be 
beneficial to both countries, yet all ancient prejudices must 
be delicately managed. ■ There are many men who have 
less wisdom than power, and more integrity than political 
information. The restriction not to carry certain articles 
to Europe, &c, is confined to the United States and the 
British islands. From other places, we may freely carry 
them. Deposites of French and Spanish sugars, &c, may 
be made in the Dutch, Danish, or other islands ; and thence 
carried where we please. English sugars, cotton, cocoa, 
and coffee will probably not be more than our consumption 
requires ; and all cotton brought into our country should be 
there manufactured. 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear sir, I have passed part of this day very 
agreeably in writing to you this long letter ; and the pleasure is increased by the opportunity it affords me, of assuring you how cordially and sincerely I am 
</p><p>
Your obliged and affectionate friend and servant,
