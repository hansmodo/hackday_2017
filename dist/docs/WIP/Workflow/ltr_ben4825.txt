MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letters of September 12th and <a rel="month origin" value="11">November</a> gth. I have now been some weeks returned from my 
journey through Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and the North 
of England, which, besides being an agreeable tour with a 
pleasant companion, has contributed to the establishment 
of my health; and this is the first ship I have heard of, 
by which I could write to you. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the receipts; they are as full and particular as one could wish; but they can easily be practised 
only in America, no bayberry wax, nor any Brasiletto, being 
here to be had, at least to my knowledge. I am glad, however, that those useful arts, which have so long been in our 
family, are now put down in writing. Some future branch 
may be the better for it. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure, that those little things sent by Jonathan proved agreeable to you. I write now to cousin Williams to press the payment of the bond. There has been forbearance enough on my part ; seven years or more, without 
receiving any principal or interest. It seems as if the debtor 
was like a whimsical man in Pennsylvania, of whom it was 
said that, it being against his principle to pay interest, and 
against his interest to pay the principal, he paid neither one 
nor the other. 
</p><p>
I doubt you have taken too old a pair of glasses, being tempted by their magnifying greatly. But people in choosing 
should only aim at remedying the defect. The glasses that 
enable them to see as well, at the same distance they used to 
hold their book or work, while their eyes were good, are those 
they should choose; not such as make them see better, for 
such contribute to hasten the time when still older glasses 
will become necessary. 
</p><p>
All, who have seen my grandson, agree with you in their 
accounts of his being an uncommonly fine boy, which brings 
often afresh to my mind the idea of my son Franky, though 
now dead thirty-six years, whom I have seldom since seen 
equalled in every thing, and whom to this day I cannot think 
of without a sigh. Mr. Bache is here; I found him at 
Preston, in Lancashire, with his mother and sisters, very 
agreeable people, and I brought him to London with me. 
I very much like his behaviour. He returns in the next 
ship to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. The gentleman, who brought your 
last letter, Mr. Fox, stayed but a few minutes with me, and 
has not since called, as I desired him to do. 
</p><p>
I shall endeavour to get the arms you desire for cousin 
Coffin. Having many letters to write, I can now only add my 
love to cousin Jenny, and that I am, as ever, your affectionate 
</p><p>
brother ' B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. Sally Franklin presents her duty. Mrs. Stevenson 
desires to be affectionately remembered. No arms of the 
Folgers are to be found in the Herald's Office. I am persuaded it was originally a Flemish family, which came over 
with many others from that country in Queen Elizabeth's 
time, flying from the persecution then raging there.
