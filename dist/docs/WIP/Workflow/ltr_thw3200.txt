SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving your favor of the 
17th instant, which was immediately laid before the 
Council. 
</p><p>
In consequence of this application we have ordered 
out two classes of militia, offering an exemption from 
their fines to such delinquents of the former classes 
as can be prevailed upon to join them, and have invited all, of every class, to turn out as volunteers. 
The Lieutenants have orders, if they do not find 
these two classes turn out generally, to order to 
camp the next two succeeding classes. To encourage 
the people to exert themselves with alacrity, we 
have published an address, offering every motive we 
could suggest, to stimulate our constituents to their 
duty. What numbers may be drawn forth into service, in consequence of these measures, we cannot 
possibly ascertain with precision; but believe they 
will be more than we can possibly arm. If you 
should think proper to encourage our calling forth 
unarmed men, under the prospect of their finding 
arms at camp, we will endeavour to do more; but, 
from the view your letter presents of the want of that 
necessary article with you, we think it unnecessary 
to take further measures, at present, to draw forth a 
multitude of people who cannot afford any service. 
</p><p>
The other important subject, mentioned in your letter, of taking measures for completing our Continental battalions, I shall communicate to the Legislature as soon as they meet. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
