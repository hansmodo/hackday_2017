DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The person I sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> is returned. He had 
an opportunity to confer with him, with Fraser and others, and 
was suffered to return into the country, under the character of a 
Recruiting Officer. He informs me that the flying camp is about 
three miles below Fort Miller, on the east side of the river, and 
consists of seventeen hundred men ; that the American troops are 
about half a mile above them, and he supposes there are about 
fifteen hundred of them. About one mile above, is the German 
camp ; then the British head-quarters, number unknown. At Fort 
Edward there are about three hundred men, commanded by a 
Major; about one hundred and fifty at Fort George; about five 
hundred at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. By every appearance, the enemy's designs are to move down the river. This is confirmed by every 
person who comes out. 
</p><p>
My informant gives it as his opinion, from the best evidence 
he could collect, that there are about six thousand European 
troops on the south of Lake Champlain. I hear, by another per 
son who left <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a> the 30th ultimo, that the enemy had 
sent one English regiment, and fifteen or sixteen light field-pies, 
to Fort Anne ; and that, on the 2d instant, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> intended to remove his heavy cannon to Stillwater. I hope you 
will take possession before him, as I know, in that case, you will 
seriously dispute title with him; and doubt not but you will con 
vince him that his claim is insupportable. 
</p><p>
I have sent to the officers, civil and military, and to a number 
of private gentlemen in the county of Berkshire, desiring their 
aid to the Commissary, by furnishing him with teams to forward 
on the flour here as fast as possible. I have received a quantity 
of ammunition from <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a>; have now a good supply, 
and have good reason to believe that I shall have a sufficiency 
of flour. Beef we have in plenty. I have the honor to be, dear General, 
</p><p>
With the warmest sentiments of regard and esteem, &c., 
</p><p>
