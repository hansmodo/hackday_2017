</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In consequence of a conference held between the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> and myself at this place, the French army will march, as soon as circumstances will 
admit, and form a junction with the American army upon the North River. The accomplishment of the 
object, which we have in contemplation, is of the utmost importance to America, and will, in all probability 
be attained, unless there should be a failure on our part In the number of men, which will be required for 
the operation, or the enemy should withdraw a considerable part of their force from the southward. It is in 
our own power, by proper exertions, to prevent the former; and, should the latter take place, we shall be amply repaid our expenses, by liberating the southern States, 
where we have found by experience we are vulnerable. 
</p><p>
Upon the calculations, that I have been able in concert with some of the most experienced French and 
American officers to form, the operation in view will 
require, in addition to the French army, all the Continental  battalions from New Hampshire to New Jersey 
inclusive to be completed to their full establishment. 
You must be sensible, that the measures taken for that 
purpose, in consequence of the last requisition of Congress, have been very far from answering the end ; as 
few recruits, comparatively speaking, have yet been 
sent forward, and of those, many have been discharged 
on account of their inability. You must also take into 
consideration, that a number of those men, who were 
returned when the requisition was made, have since 
been taken off by the various casualties incident to an 
army ; I estimate about one sixth of the whole number, and therefore provision must at this time be made 
to replace them. 
</p><p>
From what has been premised, you will perceive, 
without my urging further reasons, the necessity I am 
under of calling upon you in the most earnest manner, 
to devise means to send into the field without delay 
the number of men, which has been already voted for 
the completion of the battalions of your State, and the 
further deficiency of one sixth just mentioned. The 
term of three years, or for the war, would undoubtedly 
be preferable to any shorter period ; but if they cannot be obtained on those conditions, necessity must 
oblige us to take them for the campaign only, which 
ought to be reckoned to the last day of December. I 
should hope, that, by proper exertions in collecting and 
sending forward the men that have been already raised, 
and compelling by vigorous and decisive methods the 
delinquent towns to furnish their quotas, the greater 
part of the men may be collected by the 1st of July. 
</p><p>
Arguments surely cannot be wanting to impress the legislature with a due sense of the obligation, which they are under, of furnishing the means now called for. 
The enemy, counting upon our want of ability, or upon our want of energy, have, by repeated detachments to the southward, reduced themselves in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to a 
situation, which invites us to take advantage of it ; and, should the lucky moment be lost, it is to be feared that they will, after subduing the southern States, raise 
a force in them sufficient to hold them, and return again to the northward with such a number of men, as will render <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> secure against any force, which 
we can at this time raise or maintain. Our allies in this country expect and depend upon being supported by us in the attempt, which we are about to make, and 
those in Europe will be astonished, should we neglect the favorable opportunity, which is now offered. 
</p><p>
As it is probable, that some militia, in addition to the full complement of Continental troops, may be necessary to support communications and for other purposes, 
you will be pleased to direct four hundred men to be held in readiness to march within one week after I 
shall call for them, to serve three months after they 
have joined the army. And I would take the liberty 
of requesting, that the executive may be vested with 
full powers, during the recess, to comply with any further requisition I may make for men, provisions, or 
the means of transportation, which last may be most 
essential in the course of our operations, should it become necessary to bring provisions or stores from a 
distance. 
</p><p>
I shall be glad to be favored with an answer as soon 
as possible, with an assurance of what I may depend 
upon ; that, if I do not clearly see a prospect of being 
supported, I may turn my views to a defensive instead 
of an offensive plan, and save the States and our allies 
the expense, which would be needlessly incurred by 
any but an ample and effectual preparation. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p>
