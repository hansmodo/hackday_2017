Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Randolph</a>, which accompanies this, 
contains very full and accurate information respecting 
our negotiations here. You will perceive that many 
parts are under consideration, and that alterations will 
probably yet take place in several articles. Although 
it is uncertain, yet it is not altogether improbable, 
that <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> and myself may agree on terms 
which, in my opinion, should not be rejected. In that 
case I shall be strongly induced to conclude, rather 
than, by delays, risk a change of views and measures 
or Ministers, which unforeseen circumstances might 
occasion. 
</p><p>
The Secretary's letter by <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a>, and the 
speech of the latter to the Convention, are printed; 
and have caused a disagreeable sensation in the public mind here, and probably in that of the Government. The one written by you is spoken of as being 
within the limits of diplomatic forms. Gentlemen, 
whether in or out of office, are doubtless free in their 
personal affections or predilections for persons or nations. But, as the situation of the United States is 
neutral, so also should be their language to the belligerent powers. Neither can it be proper to adopt 
any mode of pleasing one party, that would naturally 
be offensive to the other ; and more particularly at a 
time when, with that other, a negotiation for peace, 
commerce, and friendship is pending. To be fair, 
upright, and prudent, is to be politic ; and of the 
truth of this maxim, your character, and very singular degree of respectability, weight, and reputation, 
afford the strongest proof 
</p><p>
I learn that Virginia is escheating British property ; 
and I hear of other occurrences that I regret. But 
they shall not abate my perseverance in endeavouring to preserve peace, and bring the negotiation to 
such a conclusion as will either insure peace with 
this country, or produce union among ourselves in 
prosecuting war against it. Whatever may be the 
issue, I am determined not to lose the only satisfaction that I can be sure of; namely, the satisfaction 
resulting from a consciousness of having done my 
duty. That attempts will be made, in America, to 
frustrate this negotiation, I have not the most distant 
shadow of a doubt. I brought that belief and opinion 
with me; and my dependence then was, and still is, 
on the wisdom, firmness, and integrity of the Government ; on the general good sense of our people ; and 
on those enlightened and virtuous characters among 
them, who regard the peace, honor, and welfare of 
their country as primary objects. These men regret 
the differences which subsist between this country and 
their own ; and sincerely desire to see mutual animosities give way to mutual good will. As to a political connection with any country, I hope it will never 
be judged necessary; for I very much doubt whether 
it would ultimately be found useful. On the contrary, 
it would, in my opinion, introduce foreign influence, 
which I consider as the worst of political plagues. 
With the best wishes for your health and happiness, 
and with perfect respect, esteem and attachment, I 
am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, and obliged servant, 
</p><p>
John Jay.
